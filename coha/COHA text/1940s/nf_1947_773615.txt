txt scope . I am sorry that , because of my use of space , I shall not be able to do anything like justice to Tobias Smollett , the Scotsman who , born in 1721 , published his Roderick Random in 1748  --  the same year as Clarissa . Of Smollett , it may be said briefly , that he perfected the picaresque romance ? he had all the stuff for this , for , disappointed in his early hopes as a dramatist , he had , a navy doctor , gone to sea . After five years of adventure he returned to London , where he set up as a surgeon in Downing Street . Roderick Random , with its attractive hero and quick-moving scenes , obtained a success that justified him in trusting his fortune to his pen . Smollett was ? as far as I know  --  the first novelist to attempt to define the novel . " A novel , " he says in one of his dedications , " is a large diffused picture , comprehending the characters of life , disposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purposes of a uniform plan . . . This plan , " he adds , " can not be executed with propriety , probability , or success , without a principal personage to attract the attention , unite the incidents , unwind the clue of the labyrinth , and at last close the scene , by virtue of his own importance . " One criticism of Smollett is that his heroes fail to unite the incidents in the novels that they so often name ? the incidents being too various for any one character to unite . He has , again , been accused of coarseness . In reality , the touchy , difficult Scotsman ( few people knew him well ) had a more delicate stomach than his contemporaries : the brutality that was the dark side of our Age of Reason inspired a sort of nausea in him  --  his reactions were the reactions of nausea . He excelled , perhaps overreached himself , in burlesque . . . . His Peregrine Pickle came in 1751 , Ferdinand , Count Fathom in 1753 , and his last and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1771 . He admitted he owed much to foreign influences , to Cervantes and to Lesage 's Gil Bias . His great lack , as an artist , was equanimity . And he bred , through no fault of his own , a most regrettable host of imitators , who threatened again to bring the name of the novel down . The subtlety lacking in Smollett was brought to a fine point in Laurence Sterne . Born in 1713 , at Clonmel in Ireland , son of a poor lieutenant , Sterne , upon leaving Cambridge , took holy orders . During his twenty years ' cure of a Yorkshire parish his cloth did not debar him from the enjoyment of privileged eccentricity : he fiddled , shot , had a circle of wild friends , wrote sermons , and all the time revolved a number of matters in the white heat of his curious intellect . The result was to be Tristram Shandy ? written in Yorkshire , published in London 1759 . Contemporary London , dazzled , hardly knew what to think , and we hardly know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tristram Shandy bears no intellectual date . It is dementedly natural in its course , surrealist in its association of images . One does not attempt to " follow " Tristram Shandy ; one consigns oneself , dizzily , to it . This seems all the odder , because the plot in so far as there is any plot  --  is static . The characters  --   --  Mr. and Mrs. Shandy , Uncle Toby , Corporal Tim , Yorick the parson , the dapper doctor stand still , but soar and enlarge from their roots like trees . Young Tristram spends much of his time as an embryo : by the end of the book he is about five years old . The Widow Wadman 's appearance is brief and fatal . One may say that , in the pages of Tristram Shandy , one finds the whole of English fantasy charted  --  and what a fantasy ! This is a book that inspires volumes : one can not do much with it in a paragraph . Some people hate Sterne : they say he is maddening and indecent . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . In 1768 he published the Sentimental journey  --  a fluid , delicious , capricious and on the whole " easier " book . Dr. Johnson 's Rasselas , not exactly a novel , left its impressive mark on the century . It was Johnson who , through an act of kind interference , brought to light the distracted Goldsmith 's Vicar of Wakefield . Oliver Goldsmith , born in Ireland 1728 , and educated at Trinity College , Dublin , had come grimly poor to London , after a series of Continental adventures , only to find a grimmer poverty there . The manuscript of The Vicar of Wakefield had moved about with his person , in and out of debtors ' prisons , for some years : when the book did come to be published , in 1766 , the author still maintained in his preface , " There are an hundred faults in this thing . " He can but have felt , however , how his book 's spirit transcends possible faults . With The Vicar of Wakefield , the eighteenth century 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true virtue  - -  humble and tried . The Primrose family , with their innocence , their hopes and fears , their lyrical domesticity , exist in an element that seems hardly literature , so unlike is this to the air of another book . Here are the beauty and pathos of youthfulness  --  the Vicar himself seems hardly old . And when poor lovely Olivia stoops to folly , never did such true sadness surround a fall . As to writing  --  Goldsmith is the most delicate narrative stylist the eighteenth century put out . He adds to Defoe 's directness a poetic lucidity of his own . His comic sense has something rueful about it  --  all the same , he adds , with the figure of Mrs. Primrose , to the English gallery of great silly women . Mrs. Shandy was there before her ; Mrs. Bennet is to join her soon . With this gem , The Vicar of Wakefield , the first great age of the English novel closed . But the age has a footnote , or epilogue , that one must not miss . Miss Fanny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Norfolk , in 1752 , by which year Fielding and Richardson had already finished their best work , comes in time to contribute the woman 's view of the Age of Reason and its society . In view of the prejudice against lady writers , Miss Burney not only published anonymously but wrote in secrecy and with some sense of guilt . However , Dr. Johnson 's approval was later to justify her career . She was sheltered and nicely bred the daughter of a doctor of music , 242 whose move with his family up to London added interest to without ever disturbing the tenor of his domestic life and when she wrote her two most successful novels she still knew little directly of the world . She , however , contemplates scenes of callousness that amount to brutality with just that equanimity Smollett lacked . Fanny Burney lived to be Queen Charlotte 's attendant at the secluded Court , to be chased round Kew Gardens by poor King George III in one of his fits of maniac playfulness , to record all this in a lively journal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emigre , M. D'Arblay . Perhaps real life a little diminished her , for her early work is her best 243 as having the freshness of someone who still expects much from experience . This freshness endears to us her young heroines . She is not a great novelist ? her men are flat figures , though expertly cut out , and her women lack what she lacked : intellect , passion , irony ? but she is an engaging , ingenious , often convincing one . Evelina , her first novel , published 1778 , is the story of A Young Lady 's Entrance into the World , with the vicissitudes ? largely aggressions by vulgar people ? that attended it . Fanny Burney 's heroines , unlike Jane Austen 's , seldom rise above those social miseries that it is their creator 's special joy to describe . Could Evelina , for instance , had she found herself in Clarissa Harlowe 's position , have suffered more than she does in being seen about with the awful Branghtons ? One doubts it . A subtle falseness of values impairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Cecilia , following Evelina , this weakness more plainly appears . Burney women , though they protest and blush , are made up of tacit acceptances . A roue could have seen Woman in these feminine novels and felt few stirrings of self-reproach ; he could ask , " Can one fundamentally wrong Woman , when she is not able to feel fundamental wrong ? " The ardent spirit in woman had been already saluted by Fielding and Richardson : Jane Austen and the Brontes were later to make its voice heard . WE must take it that now , for a few decades , the first great English impulse towards the novel , the social impulse , seemed to come to a pause . Already a revolt against Reason , and against its controlling effects , seemed to be on its way . The escape from society , this time , was not to be to the green glades of Arcadia but to the haunted castle and beetling crag . Fancy , so long kept down , now violently reasserted itself .

This gothic sub-literature is a specialist 's subject : I have only room here to name two of its practitioners , Monk Lewis and Mrs. Radcliffe ? who closed the century with her Mysteries of Udolpho ( 1794 ) . This crude opening of a romantic revival is , however , important , and must be noted : in it appears that shadowy , deep underneath of the English nature ? a nature of which , in the great eighteenth-century novels , we have so far seen only the daylit , orderly top . ( Though the dark has already come up through Richardson , with his " brown nodding horrors of elms and pines . " ) We shall observe how the nineteenth-century novelists attempted to keep in balance the English darkness and day . Apart from its gothic movement , the novel now tended to lapse and fall into disrepute . In quality it grew vapid ; in quantity it was overproduced . Extravagant sensibility gave it its strongest colour ; it was felt to threaten the not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 244 JANE AUSTEN seems to belong to no century . Her " modernity " has been commented on which is , I suppose , an agreeable way of saying that she is still some distance ahead of us . I have , earlier , coupled her name with Fielding 's : she is like him in her feeling for comedy , her highness of spirit , and , most of all , in so completely not being a muff . She was born in 1775 , in Hampshire , at Steventon , of which her father was rector , and her earlier novels were written , though not published , within the bounds of the eighteenth century . Publication dates  --  - Sense and Sensibility , 1811 ; Pride and Prejudice , 1813 ; Mansfield Park , 1814 ; Emma , 1816 ; Persuasion with Northanger Abbey , 1818 ( after her death )  --  do not represent her novels ' actual order in her working life . Persuasion was , in fact , her last novel , but Northanger Abbey  --  which owes its initial satiric idea to Mrs. Radcliffe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written as far back as 1798 , and Pride and Prejudice , under another title , was the first of her published novels to be written ? in 1797 , when she was twenty-two . 245 Herself a delighted reader of novels , Jane Austen saw no reason , and was to show no reason , why the novel should lapse from that place of honour that Fielding and Richardson gained for it . Her own and , I think , only explicit defence of the novel is to be come on early in Northanger Abbey , and here the spirit matches the irony . " Yes , novels , " she says , " . . . performances which have only genius , wit and taste to recommend them . " She took up her own pen , however , in no dogmatic spirit . She wrote , at her edge of the family parlour table , with just that zest for the scene and joy in discrimination with which she chose new ribbons , flirted and danced . But her genius was imperative . She surrounded each subject she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There has been a tendency to accept Jane Austen as no more than a faultless practitioner of the minute : her own remark ( to a too fervent clergyman ) about the two inches of ivory has been held against her . It is true that she made no effort to pass , through art , outside the range of her own , a gentlewoman 's , experience : her novels depict the lives of leisured young men and women in country houses or on visits to Bath or London . Men ( and women ) in action were her subject , and with her vivid precision she placed action where , by the chance of her birth , she most often saw it ? in drawingrooms and ballrooms , on lawns , in shopping streets . But what she at once depicted and penetrated was not just a world , it was the world . She arrived at , and was able to fix for us , the denominators of desire , selfdelusion and passion that are common to every kind of human experience . Her view of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confined by , drawing-rooms and lawns . She applies big truths to little scenes so no scene stays " little " under her hand . The constraints of polite behaviour serve only to store up her characters ' energies ; she dispels , except for the very stupid , the fallacy that life with the lid off  --  in thieves ' kitchens , prisons , taverns and brothels  --  is necessarily more interesting than life with the lid on . It is true she has drawn no rebels : her people expect , and derive , pleasure from the straight-forward living of life . But they plan ; they seek , with degrees of determination , ideal circumstances , ideal relationships inside that world they already know . They locate , and never far from themselves , possible darkness , chaos ; they feel the constant threat of the wrong ? be this only a mean act , a callous or a designing remark , a subtly deceiving proposition , a lie . The world Jane Austen creates remains an absolute world because of its trueness to its own scale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's novels resides in their being so innately grown-up . In enjoying the youthfulness of her women most youthful of all in their mistakes ? we are at the same time conscious of something in them that remains ageless and poised . So high is this norm of maturity that infantilism , in one form or another , appears as the root of all faults and absurdities : it is imperfect grown-upness that makes people brag , fuss , prattle , play-act or flatter themselves . Among 246 the heroines , poise appears most in her first , Elizabeth Bennet , and in her last , Anne Elliot . But also , Emma Woodhouse retains a lovable balance throughout her headstrong career , and deluded , naive little Catherine Morland keeps not only Henry Tilney 's but the reader 's respect . Fanny Price and Elinor Dashwood remain just a shade too sober for many tastes . But one must see that Fanny 's sobriety gives much to the structure of Mansfield Park , while Elinor acts as the counterpoise to unstable , brilliant Marianne .... Jane Austen has also been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that her leisurely , civilised young creatures deny to the passion its true place . She was a great supporter of the rational passion , and the young men allowed to inspire this in her brilliant and her fastidious women are not with the major exceptions of Mr. Darcy and volatile Henry Tilney ? men whom one feels would inspire much . Her tempting alternatives to reason  --  Willoughby , Frank Churchill , Henry Crawford ? are always better done . But , as against this , with what gallant sparkling composure , almost Shakespearean , her heroines ' flirtations are conducted , and with what fineness the early shades of attraction are recognised ! Silence always falls on couples of plighted lovers ? as though feeling paused outside a door . And , Persuasion ? could there be a deeper picture of a woman loving too late , apparently without hope ? ' Technically ? that is , as to matters of form , plot , characterisation , dialogue , setting ? Jane Austen remains the most nearly flawless of English novelists . She could not have been other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other writers we have in an artistry that no sentiment blurred , no theory narrowed and no rancour or prejudice side-tracked . BORN , north of the Border , four years before Jane Austen ? in fact , in 1771 Sir Walter Scott was to release England 's imagination . Desire for exaltation , love of strangeness , had so far given birth only to gothic tales : Jane Austen had ridiculed mystery . Scott 's majestic narrative poems ? The Lay of the Last Minstrel , 1805 ; Marmion , 18o8 ; The Lady of the Lake , 1810 ? had first made England look North , and look North with awe . One was met by a landscape dark with clouds and feeling , charged with the past , lost battles , old memories and relentless dreams , a landscape against which the human figure could only stand out in heroic acts . England , who long ago with the Stuarts had accepted a line of Scottish kings , now began to drink in the Scottish tradition-  --  a tradition that returned Fate to its place . ( Eighteenth-century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had up to now stressed will rather than fate . ) Scott , when he turned to the novel , showed the first great impulse that owed nothing to the sense of society  --  - though it owed everything to the sense of race . What Scott did for his own country in giving voice to its nature is Scotland 's and not England 's affair : what is certain is that he 247 rushed in on England to fill an emotional vacuum . For the mannered , dry-witted age of the Regency , Jane Austen perfected the novel of manners but this same age received , as though it were parched , Scott 's novels that rolled down on it like rain-clouds . And about the man himself there was something warm and commanding that seemed to mellow the air . The first of his novels , Waverley , appeared in 1814 ? same year as Mansfield Park . Guy Mannering followed in 1815 ; The Antiquary shared 1816 with Emma . From then on , the Scott novels are too numerous and regular to enumerate ; outstanding names and dates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Bride of Lammermoor ( 1819 ) , Ivanhoe ( 1820 ) , Kenilworth ( 1821 ) , Peveril of the Peak ( 1822 ) , Quentin Durward ( 1823 ) , Redgauntlet ( 1824 ) , Woodstock ( 1826 ) , The Fair Maid of Perth ( 1828 ) . Count Robert of Paris and Castle Dangerous , his last two short novels , appeared in 1832  --  the year of his death . The idea of the historical novel was in itself , to the England of that day , new . Novelty , linked with its own outstanding power , secured for Waverley immediate success . The past , with its accumulation of feeling , was presented with the likeliness of the present day . And when Scott dealt with his own day , as in Guy Mannering and The Antiquary , past-like emotion gave depth to the scene . He was less happy when , as a tour de force , he adventured ? as in Ivanhoe , The Talisman , Kenilworth ? into English history : reconstruction here is too obvious ; the scenes seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art off , in fact , from its natural source when he detached himself from his own native mystery . He was truly creative only in regard to his own land . His people are epic figures or nothing , and he could see the epic only in people he instinctively knew . So his novels have their own psychic atmosphere . Most of the plots contain some major heroic passion . The characters range from great to lowly ? many are simple , wanderers , naive narrative talkers , the trustful , the half-crazed . Scott 's treatment of sexual love is stilted less dishonest than shy . Love with him is always involved with some other aspect of fate . His style depends on emotion for force and lift ; so that , when at times the emotion behind it lapses , one feels let down , and resents the verbosity . But such a style , with its poetic richness , was bound , coming when it did , to fecundate English prose . I am less concerned to claim Scott 's Scottish novels for England than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , on the whole , a loosening one . As such , it was strongly resisted by William Makepeace Thackeray , who , son of a British official in India , had been born near Calcutta in 1811 . Thackeray vowed himself to the anti-heroic . Consciously unfortunate Victorian , he was preyed upon by nostalgia for the eighteenth century seldom does a nostalgia set in so soon . With him it was a case of " Of thee I dream . . . . " Not only did he regret his own place in time , but he is said to have felt that he could 248 have written better had he not been English : this seems strikingly true . Also , much happened to damp down in Thackeray anything like a spontaneous love of life ? having received a gentleman 's education , and formed along with that a gentleman 's ample tastes , he lost his money and was condemned for some time to a seedy existence abroad : when he married , his wife became insane after four years . He lacked the resilience of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his attempts at realism he was infected , more than he may have realised , by the insincerities of his period . Need to repair his fortunes in the first place drove Thackeray to the pen . He had been writing for papers for some years , under varying pseudonyms and.with increasing success , when Vanity Fair , with his own name on the covers , began to appear in monthly parts in the year 1847-8 all but a hundred years after Torn Jones . This first and great novel of Thackeray 's creates for itself an epoch . It was an ambitious book that had not failed . Prodigal in incident , character , sense of period , saturated in humour , spontaneous in its criticism of life , it is in form , at the same time , absolutely controlled . Possibly Thackeray 's natural bent was to write about wicked people rather than good . The Vanity Fair characters , stamped with life for ever , are headed by that great bad girl Becky Sharp , whose 249 career across other lives her creator follows with a submerged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The good  --  through their imperfect virtue ? are fooled : Thackeray sees the vice in a sentiment . The length and variety of the book  --  there is everything in it from a good-bye to a girl 's school to drama before the battle of Waterloo  --  are part of its merit : it suited Thackeray 's powers to take a panoramic view of experience . He here uses perfectly his astringent style . The sub-title is A Novel without a Hero ? and , in fact , there is no one central character , and nobody that one is enjoined to admire ; he gave the book a moral rather than human plan . But this does not make it either abstract or cold . Vanity Fair is entrancing , engaging from first to last . What happened to Thackeray after this ? His powers , after Vanity Fair , seem to me to have horribly misdirected themselves . His conceptions remain spacious , his style sometimes masterly and always efficient . But I think he made a mistake in abandoning the complete moral detachment of Vanity Fair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in attempting to make disillusionments a matter of tragedy rather than comedy , he commits himself to a sentimentality that is at once laboured and insincere . His anti-heroicism involves every character in the same tepid atmosphere . His Esmond ( 1852 ) is important as being the first English historical novel : the period of the story is Queen Anne . Thackeray , steeped in the Augustine Age , could now give his nostalgias rein : Steele , Swift , Addison walk and talk through the pages  --  - but they seem to creak . In fact , throughout Esmond one gets the feeling that damp has got into the works . The triangular situation between Esmond , Lady Castlewood and her daughter Beatrix is boldly conceived but timidly handled  --  Thackeray may have had this in mind when he implied that he would have liked to be French . Pendennis ( 1848 ) had preceded Esmond ; The Newcomes ( 1853-5 ) followed it . These two novels are interesting as documents of Thackeray 's own class the upper-middle ? and age the early Victorian . They contain some portraits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Newcomes are shells of great novels ? or should one say great shells of novels ? But life ? and surely they once had life ? seems to have evaporated from them . Over good Colonel Newcome does anybody survive who could shed a tear ? . . . No , the loose rich romantic fullness of Scott certainly did nothing to Thackeray . As an acknowledged influence on Dickens , I do not remember having heard Scott named but there must have been something propitious to Dickens 's temperament in the atmosphere Scott had left behind . Dickens 's subjects are as superficially prosaic as Scott 's are evidently poetic , but romantic energy is common to both . Charles Dickens was born at Portsmouth in 1812  --  a year after Thackeray . His father was a dockyard clerk whose character was to be idealised into Mr. Micawber ; his mother is said to have inspired Mrs. Nickleby . Such an alliance was not likely to 250 make for domestic stability : the family tottered along and now and then crossed the line that divides fecklessness from declared ruin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and little Charles , as a debtor 's visiting son , became familiar with the Marshalsea debtors ' prison . To support himself , the boy of twelve worked in a blacking factory , filling and labelling pots . His father 's release from prison set him free to attend a seedy school ; he picked up enough learning to make himself into a solicitor 's clerk . Later he taught himself shorthand , and , as reporter for several papers , sat in the gallery of the House of Commons . This was to be only one phase of his career as a journalist . He knocked about England , saw and tackled life , drew conclusions , collected fantastic facts . All his youth he had been an omnivorous reader ; his feeling for " story " had been developed young . So he wrung the most out of every experience : nothing that happened to Dickens went to waste . The class from which Dickens sprang  --  the English shabby-genteel , holding tight to the fringe of respectability  --  had been up to now ignored by art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age ruled by commercial ideas of success , in which human values were crude and on the whole mean . England was still unwilling to cope with the bad conditions industrialism created . Can one 25I wonder at Dickens 's exaltation ? call it sentimental  --  of the good heart ? Can one wonder at his tenderness for the devices of fancy by which underdog people manage to live ? The sociological aspect of Dickens I have not got room to discuss here . But remember that he had first been thrust into , and had later explored by his own will , abysses of injustice and human waste . Though success met him early ? in fact , with the publication of the Pickwick Papers , in monthly parts , in 1836 ? he never ceased to feel what he had seen . The buoyancy of his spirits did not make him a less implacable moralist . He brought up his picturesque , persuasive , sometimes extravagant art against the well-fed callousness that comes largely from lack of imagination  --  and he did live to see some reforms . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was violently sentimental : leave it at that . But defiantly , perhaps involuntarily , what an artist he was ! There is something superbly childish  --  I mean , unspoilt ? about his imagination . He gives a child 's value  --  -a poor child 's  --  - to the enjoyment of sheer physical bliss  --  warm lit rooms , trustworthy faces , the roar of a fire , the succulence of a chop . At the same time , he keeps a child 's apprehensiveness of the weird , the unknown , the unsubstantially threatening . He gives loneliness , sense of loss or sense of betrayal all the frightful force they have fora child . Though he draws unconvincing or sugary pictures of " straight " love , he is first-rate at depicting the sinister attachment  --  such as Rosa Dartle 's to Steerforth  --  also , in the depiction of hero-worship . In fact , into all the love affairs in his books a queer adolescent strain of hero-worship , or idealisation , enters on one or the other side . His linked senses of threat and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atmospheres of landscapes , houses and streets . And he is frightening in his sense of the power of all kinds of obsession and fantasy . He was too much embroiled with his subject to be detached in his style . But his emotional vision sometimes produces the most mobile kind of English romantic prose . Read , for instance , the passage beginning " The waters are out in Lincolnshire ... " in Chapter II . of Bleak House . Bleak House ( 1852-3 ) seems to me the most impressive , David Copperfield ( 1849-50 ) the most august and tender , and Great Expectations ( 186o-1 ) the most original of Dickens 's novels . But no name of a novel of his is unknown , and few of his novels , I think , remain unread . In him the English genius finds a wide course : he is as comprehensive as any writer we have . His zest and humour have been likened to Fielding 's . But he has in common with Richardson his perception of the nervous , or dusky , side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfinished a mystery story , Edwin Drood . His growing preoccupation with mystery was due to his friendship with Wilkie Collins , who , born in 1824 , was to do brilliantly in this genre . Wilkie Collins , in fact , may be called the grandfather of the English detective story . He had not only a great sense of human drama but a 252 command , to be envied , of " atmospheric " style  --  - see the description of the tree-muffled Hampshire mansion at midnight , and of the dead lake , in The Woman in White . He also created ? as in Count Fosco ? superbly sinister figures , and drew some unforgettable scenes . His two greatest stories are The Woman in White ( 186o ) and The Moonstone ( 1868 ) . Anthony Trollope , another friend of Dickens , has only lately come into his own again . Less intellectual and fastidious but also less arid than Thackeray , more stolid and less fantastic than Dickens , he seems to me the most sheerly able of the English Victorian novelists . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give an objective picture of it ; he was less affected by pruderies than prepared to make discreet allowance for them . One can not deny that , with the nineteenth century , a sort of fog did begin , in the English novel , to obscure some vital aspects of life . It became more difficult to write greatly because it became less possible to write truly . There was facetiousness on the subject of class , squeamishness on the subject of sex . One could no longer travel straight across country , as the eighteenth-century novelists had done . Evasions made for sentimentality . Anthony Trollope probably recognised that , for the Victorian novelist , absolute integrity was impossible ; but he made towards an integrity of his own . . . . Born in 1 8 1 5 , three years after Dickens , he had an unhappy childhood ( see his Autobiography ) : he seemed to himself to be born at a disadvantage  --  which makes one all the more admire the 253 saneness with which he reconciled himself with life . First as a clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay of the Post Office ) , he had had usefully varied experience : he got to know all grades of society and to enjoy the stretch of the English scene . The geniality that he arrived at breathes , never speciously , through his novels  --  - whose increasing success made him able to leave the Post Office and give to his new profession his full time . He wrote hard , and under prosaic conditions . Trollope is most remembered for his clergymen : in the famous Barsetshire novels he seals up for ever the atmosphere and the personalities of an English cathedral town . He immortalised also English squires , peers , professional people and politicians . Also , I know few writers better than Trollope at conveying the charm of a charming scene . Many of his comedy characters  --  for instance , the incorrigible Bertie of Bare/tester Towers ? are first rate . He can as in The Warden  --  at once honour and analyse the English conscience at its most austere . He has the merit of being a very masculine writer . If he fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspire it : he puts the English heroine back on the map again ; his young women are lovely , ardent , intelligent , capable , true . In some of them  --  - especially Mary Thorne ? the gallant spirit once more appears . After several early tries at the novel , Trollope arrived with The Warden ( 1855 ) . The rest of the Barsetshire novels followed . He embarked with Phineas Finn ( 1869 ) on a political series  --  less well known now because less well done : Disraeli was far better in this genre . In Can You Forgive Her ? ( 1864 ) he tackled the subject of erring womanhood . Before he died he had written sixty novels in all . THE Bronte genius remains a phenomenon of all , not only of English , literature . Haworth vicarage , exposed on the wilds of Yorkshire , was the home of this family : pilgrims now gaze around the vicarage as though the force of the Bronte living must have left its mark on these darkish walls .

Charlotte went for some time to the school the Lowood of Jane Eyre ? that had killed her sisters . Branwell  --  a character so sinister that he started a darker part of the Bronte legend ? took drugs , wasted money and kept the family feeling at burning point . The sisters went out as governesses : Charlotte and Emily , in order to learn languages , attached themselves for a time to the Pensionnat Heger , in Brussels .

Charlotte , in that year , published Shirley ; Villette , a reconstruction of The Professor , appeared in 1853 . A year later she married her father 's curate , but she was to die in 1855 . The Professor was published after her death . Old Mr. Bronte was left alone at Haworth : none of his children had reached the age of forty . But it is an ageless fire that burns in the novels the Brontes left . The sisters were young chiefly in having lost none of their vehemence ; they were involved with little outside themselves  --  only Charlotte at all came to terms with life . Emily , having consumed her own lonely experience , translated experience to an unearthly plane . Wuthering Heights is a book of fire and ice : no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through , as by a wind , by a damned soul  --  the fated , fatal Heathcliff . The love in it is relentless , as pure of hope as it is of flesh . The house is solitary , exposed . . . . here is the real English dark tower of passion above all rationality . All the same , the material setting is circumstantial ; the story is full of pictures stored in Emily 's living eye  --  the feathers plucked from the pillow , the two children in the tree in the wind . The Thrushcross firelight , with its domestic promise , by contrast darkens the darkness that is the lovers ' home . And the love of Heathcliff and Catherine gains in poetic intensity by being set back inside a complex prosaic form much of the narrative is in the idiom of " ordinary " people ; the consternation of limited people frames the unlimited tragedy . Wuthering Heights bears no definite feminine stamp ? though perhaps only a woman could have liberated her spirit so completely . Charlotte Bronte 's Jane Eyre , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to end . Made in this voice , the plain , proud , unhesitating assertion of woman 's feeling for man  --  Jane 's for Rochester ? shocked the 256 England of 1847 . It had been the accepted idea that , while woman might , by very judicious degrees , respond to declared love , she did not initiate love on her own account  --  - to do so was more than doubtful , it was " unwomanly . " So Jane Eyre , in spite of its actually faultless morals , took on an odour of impropriety  --  which is not to say that it was not read . If Jane , the plain little sprite of a governess , does not court her employer Rochester , she challenges him in Cleopatra 's voice : their scene in the July dusk of the garden is unforgettable . Jane wants much more than love ; she wants human fullness of life  --  the book voiced , for the first time , woman 's demand for this . Read the scene where , alone on the roof of the country house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement , achievement , adventure feeling the masculine part of her spirit stir . Might this be called the first feminist novel ? The nature of her struggle with Rochester , who , when his existing marriage has been discovered , wants her to be his mistress , shows the hundred years ' difference between Jane and Clarissa . But Jane , like Clarissa Harlowe , still identifies virtue with the power to keep her fate in her own hands .... Jane Eyre , set nearer to every-day life than W'uthering Heights , has a few social improbabilities in which the Bronte lack of worldly experience shows . Temperamental black-whiskered Rochester may fall a prey to our laughter ; the black-souled Heathcliff never does . Charlotte Bronte , naive , starved of beauty and luxury , rather over-describes gilded scenes  --  the drawing-room lit for a party , the harpy charmer 's veneer . But there is something endearing about this weakness of hers . In Shirley she also portrays glamour ? the glamour of Shirley 's // dashing temperament . After Jane Eyre , Villette ? with its foreign atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the boarding school ? is her best book . . . . At a time when male approval , coupled with money , gave woman the only status she had , it is remarkable that the only giant novels should have been written by spinster daughters of an obscure indigent clergyman . After the Brontes , George Eliot  --  really Mary Ann Evans ? may seem opaque and pedestrian . Not for nothing did she assume a masculine name . Her intellect must be honoured ? it is more constructive than brilliant ? her emotion is gravely coloured by it . She was at grips with the problems of her day . If not an attractive , she was a great , woman : as an artist she is never to be despised . Born in 1819 , daughter of a land-agent , she , in helping her father with his business , early took a hand in practical life . Courageous in her emotions , she lived for years in free union with George Henry Lewes ? not the least of a group of advanced thinkers to whom her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people ; imagination made her penetrate them . **25;156;TOOLONG is the scene of her best books and , above all , she knew the yeoman class . She had her own sense of beauty  --  best seen in Middlemarch ( 1871 ) , Scenes from Clerical Life ( 1858 ) , and The Mill on the Floss ( 186o ) . She had humour , but is greatest in tragedy , which with her is found more in character ( with its misuse or vain sacrifices of will ) than in fate . Felix Holt the Radical was , in 1866 , the rather stark intellectual high-point of her career . For the emotional interest one expects from a novel she is best in Adam Bede ( 1859 ) and Silas Marner ( 1861 ) . She can write with a faultless convincingness , and with a noble sweep of imagination ? apart from this , her books , with their palpable truth to life , are important as documents of their day . All the same , in my heart I prefer Mrs. Gaskell ? as sincere a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Born in 181o , she had been a beautiful Chelsea girl , reared on a succession of country visits . She married a Unitarian minister and lived , worked and felt with him in Manchester , among " the dark satanic mills . " Her reaction to the injustices she found in industrial England of that day was of the heart , but was ruled by her steady head : unlike Dickens , she never overpainted ; truth seemed to her good , and bad , enough . She never lost her love ? and perhaps her nostalgia ? for the sweet , the comely , the orderly , the agreeable , though these , to warrant her love , must be founded on moral right . Happy in her own life as a woman , she was keenly aware of injustices done to her sex in the name of morality ? she wrote her bold Ruth in 1853 . Before this had come Mary Barton , a Tale of Manchester Life ( 1848 ) , which is a document of the Chartist year . Called the first " labour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and men . North and South is much in the same vein . Cranford , that delicious idyll of gentility , appeared the 258 same year as Ruth ? to which it is a counterpoise . It is Cranford , with its immortal old ladies , that keeps Mrs. Gaskell 's name so widely known and loved in the world . Reading Cranford after Jane Austen 's Emma ? that other picture of an enclosed society ? one is conscious of the change there had been in England in the forty years between those two books . Emma Woodhouse 's Highbury is unthreatened ; Miss Matty 's Cranford is not ? behind its orderly , small-town silence one feels vibrations from " Drumble " ? the not distant out-spreading Manchester . . . . In the Wives and Daughters she did not live to finish ( she died in 1865 ) Mrs. Gaskell returns to the Southern scene . With these four Victorian women writers we seem to come to the close of a period : we pass from the Mid-Victorian to the Late . The change is , rather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several of George Meredith 's novels , for instance , were contemporaries of George Eliot 's , and his first , The Shaving of Shagpat , appeared only nine years after Wuthering Heights . He was born in 1828 ? and was to live on 259 into our century . He was of Welsh extraction , and went to a Moravian school in Wales : his grandfather had been a successful tailor  --  a fact that was to be dug up by those enemies who accused him of snobbery ( there was something less arid than snobbery in Meredith 's love of the truly grand ) . On his return from school to London he became a solicitor 's clerk , but published his first Poems ( containing Love in a Valley ) in 1851 . These drew the attention , and later the friendship , of Rossetti and Swinburne to the brilliant young man . In fact , he was able to develop his talents in an atmosphere that was most propitious to them . He became the first English novelist with a conscious aesthetic  --  this may account for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had a philosophy , as opposed to a general theory of right and wrong . His poetry provides the key to his novels . Able to leave the solicitor 's office for journalism , Meredith , from his room in Rossetti 's house , wrote only for papers whose reputation did nothing to damage his promising name . Grub Street never really impinged on him . His first marriage failed : in 1864 , one year after his second , he went to live at Flint Cottage , Box Hill , Surrey , which remained his home for the rest of his long life . As a novelist Meredith has been found obscure , besides being a little too unaware of the banal side of human experience . The complex content of his prose does sometimes choke it ? his poetry , on the other hand , continues to burn with intellectual vision . It has been argued that he should have kept to poetry . But his poems  --  culminating in Modern Love and The Woods of Westermain ? are essentially those of a novelist . And without his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been lost . Perhaps as a novelist he suffers from having lived too much in an eclectic world unlike Thackeray , Dickens , Trollope , he can seldom have been mortified or bored . He tends to precipitate his characters ? who are themselves , from their start in his brain , dynamic ? into rather too special an atmosphere . His novels are , in a sense , too like operas . All the same , it was Meredith who produced that almost faultless novel The Egoist ( 1879 ) , in which the best of the English comedy spirit flowers ? at once satirical and rotund . The plot ? a high-minded baronet is more truly , less kindly seen by a young lady than was Sir Charles Grandison . Here , too , Meredith perfects , in the best tradition , a purely English scene . One might say that his scenes are more likely , on the whole , than his characters  --  these , though vivid , being at times out of drawing . His sense of heroic promise in people is shadowed by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is false within . " He adored love , and shows it as adorable  --  all the same , he sees it as an ordeal  --  his early The Ordeal of Richard Feverel ( 1859 ) even takes its title from this idea . His stories about the youngness of young men deal with evolution rather than with adventure . Sometimes he applies his vision to politics , to national aspiration , to the 26o international scene : some of his novels range far abroad . His heroines move through Olympian air : one charge against them has been that they talk too much . In his famous Diana of the Crossways ( 1885 ) he undertakes the defence of a noble creature . Evan Harrington ( 1861 ) , Rhoda Fleming ( 1865 ) , Vittoria ( 1867 ) , Beauchamp 's Career ( 1876 ) , The Amazing Marriage ( 1895 ) also stand high with Meredith readers . He may be attacked , but he can not be overlooked : I feel certain that he will stand the test of time . Samuel Butler belongs in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , has been cumulative , and his importance continues to grow to-day . Grandson of the great bishop of that same name , he , on leaving Cambridge , renounced the intention of taking holy orders and went out to New Zealand , to sheep-farm . Successful in this , he also began to write . Returning to London . he took up painting , and exhibited at the Royal Academy . It was in 1872 that he published his satire Erewhonwhich has been likened to Gulliver 's Travels . Butler might , indeed , be called the nineteenth-century Swift  --  comprehensive , at once enraged and z61 precise . Grievance  --   --  his whole bent was to science , but he held himself to be boycotted by a group of accredited scientists ? at once warped him and steeled his curious power . He has many aspects , but comes into the scope of this book because of his one novel , The Way of All Flesh . He began this in 1872 ; he laid it aside in 1885  --  and it was not published till 1903 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of English middle-class family life ( as embodied in the Pontifex family ) , especially of the relationship between parents and children , and its effects . It was well for the English eighteen-seventies and ' eighties , with their placid system of family reverence , that The Way of All Flesh , though in their time being written , was held up and did not explode on them . 1903 was quite soon enough . The Way of All Flesh , coming just when it did , has inspired a whole school of iconoclast novels . Thomas Hardy was born , near the Dorchester he was to rechristen Casterbridge , in 1840 , twelve years after Meredith . These two LateVictorian novelists have in common that they were both poets . But while Meredith might be called a magnificent by-product of the English genius , Hardy is a figure in its direct line . In fact , his is a figure in which many tendencies culminate . The strangeness of his novels  --  a strangeness as great , at times , as that of Wuthering Heights is counterpoised by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novelist ? setting his stories in a tract he called Wessex , that centres on his own county of Dorsetshire . But whereas other regional novelists simply use , Hardy created , local colour : he confers a sort of super-existence on the region he wrote about . It would be true to say that Hardy did for his part of England what Scott had done for the Border . But a whole extension of complex human experience lies between the two . Scott 's country people are walking traditions ; Hardy 's are sharply individualised : there is not one " type " in the whole of his gallery . Scott revived the dignity of the past ; Hardy , although the past works in him , is moved by a philosophic consciousness of the future . Of the hero of The Return of the Native ( 1878 ) he says , for instance : " In Clym Yeobright 's face could dimly be seen the typical countenance of the future . Should there be a classic period to art hereafter , its Phidias may reproduce such faces . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , replacing that zest for existence which was so intense in early civilisations , must ultimately enter so thoroughly into the constitution of the advanced races that its facial expression will be accepted as a new artistic departure . People already feel that a man who lives without disturbing a curve of feature , or setting a mark of mental concern upon himself , is too far from modern perceptiveness to be a modern type . . . . The observer 's eye was arrested , not by his face as a picture , but by his face as a page ; not by what it was but what it recorded . His features were attractive in the light of symbols .... " " The view of life as a thing to be put up with "  --  what a 262 long way the human spirit had travelled by the time Hardy wrote that . There is , throughout his feeling for nature , the same sublime awareness of an endurance . Egdon Heath , in the timeless November dusk , as yet crossed by no figure , occupies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was at present a place perfectly accordant with man 's nature ? neither ghastly , hateful nor ugly : neither commonplace , unmeaning or tame ; but , like man , slighted and enduring , and withal singularly colossal and mysterious in its swarthy monotony . " But meekness is no note of Hardy 's characters . His young men and women , each one singularly alone , each raise a kind of cry for perfection ? through intellectual or moral achievement , through love . Each one is made dynamic either by a desire or an idea . The most alive of the men are creatures of intellect ; the most alive of the women are creatures of passion . But he has also created the character that is stable and philosophic ? born , one might say , already half reconciled . Very often such people are very simple : old lore , inherited wisdom speak through them . The Return of the Native ( 1878 ) , Tess of the D ' Urbervilles ( 1891 ) , and Jude the Obscure ( 1896 ) , all three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hardy 's novels . All have their superhumanly human scenes ? Eustacia tending her solitary beacon fire , Tess waking from her bridal sleep to the fatal sunrise of Stonehenge , Jude 's love Sue raising her sick husband to see the sunset reflected in a bedroom mirror . Hardy 's art is , above all , diverse . His comedy spirit is , therefore , august and mellow . Merry-making , weddings and village dancing , the comic charm of bravado , naive , racy talk , the emanation of magic from a beautiful woman , the delicious negligent poise of a pretty one , the fine day and the fine fellow , the strong sweep of hope and the long sweep of open country come equally into his range . His style , sublime at its greatest , does sometimes lapse into bathos ; his dialogue , at its best idiomatic , alive with natural rhythm , has reaches of stilted unlivingness . But the architecture of his novels can not be criticised : it is beyond praise . Hardy , after a meagre education , did in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so from one art to another he carried sound rules . And , his conception of life being elemental the poet in him fused with the novelist . His outstanding novels , other than those I have mentioned , are : Under the Greenwood Tree ( 1872 ) , Far from the Madding Crowd ( 1874 ) , The Mayor of Casterbridge ( 1886 ) , The Woodlanders ( 1887 ) . F NGLAND can not really claim Henry James , though he claimed England by coming to live here and becoming in 1916 a naturalised Englishman . An American , born in New York State in 1843 , he became , while still a young man , familiar with what was civilised in both hemispheres . In their high , wise kind of sophistication , his novels are 263 cosmopolitan . At the same time , he keeps , in his observations , the alert austerity of the pioneer . He writes at once with the detachment of a spectator and the close-upness of someone under a spell . He might be called the analyst of civilisation ? and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its inconsistencies , its puzzling , superb survivals , fascinated him . And , as a novelist , he was fascinated by the phenomenon of the English conscience . His affinities , as an artist in writing , were to artists abroad ? Flaubert , Turgeniev ? but he was to crown England , at the close of one century and the start of another , with a series of novels that penetrated to the essential Englishness of her scene . One might say that she had not been so completely perceived before . One may say that James 's perceptions only worked in the particular area of his social tastes . He had an aesthetic love of the beau monde  --   - -  whether it be of artists or aristocrats . As in Meredith 's case , desire attracted him to the people and settings of which he wrote . Any character in a Henry James story or novel , however low his or her stated class in life , is promoted ? by being made articulate or susceptible ? to his or her place in James 's beau monde . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in class : even his children are , in their fineness , mature . In a sense , his adults are child-like , in having crystalline natures . The fact was , that James could only use the fine nature ? whether evil or good ? for his very special treatment of the predicament . And predicament was his subject , at every time . His sense of beauty is matched by his sense of evil : his villains do worse than oppress or threaten ? they subtly and immeasurably corrupt . His innocent characters move through danger zones ; the spirit is in peril , seldom the flesh . Evil only operates quite directly in a few of the James stories ? the great example is The Turn of the Screw . Elsewhere , its action is indirect ; it may work through the most apparently natural affections , desires and loyalties . . . see , for instance , The Spoils of Poynton ( 1896 ) . In The Golden Bowl , with its London scene of poised and controlled cosmopolitan people , he shows the implicit rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's adroitness , behind his complex constructions , is the simple pattern of the morality play . In the end , he sees nothing as beautiful that has not been proved good . He subjected to moral examination the grace , the privilege , the mystery , the tradition of the age-polished England he loved so well . Henry James 's great novels and stories are astoundingly many . His style became more and more involuted ; his later novels are not found easy to read . His first long novel was Roderick Hudson ( 1876 ) . Landmarks in his work have been : The American ( 1877 ) , Daisy Miller ( 1878 ) , The Portrait of a Lady ( 1881 ) , The Princess Casamassima ( 1886 ) , The Spoils of Poynton ( 1896 ) , What Maisie Knew ( 1897 ) , The Two Magics ( which contains The Turn of the Screw ) ( 1898 ) , The Awkward Age ( 1899 ) , The Wings of the Dove ( 1902 ) , The Ambassadors ( 1903 ) , The Golden Bowl ( 1904 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England ) till 1916 , his great fiction period had closed years before that . So Henry James has carried us over from the nineteenth century to our own . The same transition was made by a number of novelists whom , alas , I have no room to name here . In fact , the great Late-Victorians I have discussed were in reality far from isolated : to let them seem so gives an incomplete picture of their day . It has taken years for them to stand out from among their more popular contemporaries . I am now conscious of two very bad lacuna , in not having mentioned either George Gissing or George Moore ? the first a " straight " realist , the second an aestheterealist , Irish , much touched by French influence , whose work has an outstanding quality . And a still graver omission is Robert Louis Stevenson , the second great Scot to influence England . In his power to raise the story of action to a heroic , sometimes poetic , level , Stevenson was to be approached by Joseph Conrad ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of fervour and glory  --  a temperament . I can name , in the space that is left to me , only four novelists who carry forward into , or at least touch , our own time . There is Rudyard Kipling , for instance . The artist in him has been quite wrongly obscured , in some views , by the Imperialist . Actually , lie was realistic , quite disabused , about English life abroad as well as at home . The dramatic side of the Empire did appeal to him ? but he knew its plain working side well , as a journalist . He likes energy , courage , action in any form : if he salutes these in the English one can not blame him . His best work is in the field of the short story ? setting and incident interest him more than character , though his touch on character can be devastatingly sure . His long novel , The Light that Failed , is , though moving , on the sentimental side . No English writer has been more mobile and vivid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one see , smell , touch what he describes : his descriptions are charged with reality . For a number of untravelled English people he has , for instance , " created " India for ever . He has , and quite often likes to use , a real English-gothic command of the horrific . In Plain Tales from the Hills , and other collections , he has written some ruthless love-stories : love does not appear to Kipling to be a rational passion . Anglo-Indian life , boy life and the British Army are , in general , taken to be his province . In his children 's stories he shows pure imagination in his treatment of the past and of animals . He was born in Bombay in 1865 , and the publication dates of his books extend from 1881 to 1930 . He has left us some classic tales of the 1914-18 war . H. G. Wells , born 1866 , has , like Samuel Butler , the scientific approach to life . He applies science to the novel . Like Hardy , he has a constant sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future only as the extreme of a psychic state , Wells commits himself to exact material prophecies . Science has justified his predictions by already coming abreast // Patrician ( 1911 ) , The Dark Flower ( 1913 ) , In Chancery ( 1920 ) , To Let ( 1921 ) . These four writers ? Kipling , Wells , Bennett and Galsworthy have been in their time , and each in his own way , more revolutionary than any younger men . We now take for granted a great deal that they achieved . The novelist of to-day has less to react against . So we feel some break in temperament between these four last Late-Victorians and the novelists who are at their maturity to-day ? for instance , Aldous Huxley , Somerset Maugham . Has there come , too , a break in the English novel tradition ? Looking back , we may say that the English novelists have , from the eighteenth century up to some years ago , excelled in the creation of character , and , secondarily , in the drawing of scenes , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have left us a gallery of immortal English creatures eccentrics , haphazard fine young men , fantasists , optimists , blackguards , silly women , dashing bad women , lovely spirited girls ; they have left us English landscapes as various as ever came from the sweep of an English brush . Hardy and Meredith , poet-novelists , were the first to indicate any change . There is , I think , a change now , though not a break . D. H. Lawrence has come and gone : his explosive novels have had the effect of a sort of depth-charge , bringing much to the surface . Lawrence was , it would seem , at once behind and in advance of his own time : his puritanical antipuritanism was paradoxical . In writing of worlds he knew , he commanded an admirable realism , tinged with poetry , and a simplicity that has not been praised enough ; these having been obscured , for the general reader , by his " prophetic " quality , and by his ( apparent ) doctrine of purification by fire i.e. , sexual passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major part in shifting the stress from character  --   --  in which , ever since , our contemporary novelists show an interest that is much less exclusive . They continue to turn , instead , to just those ideas and passions of which their predecessors fought shy . In this they are not un-English ; they are simply returning to an English age before the novel began . In fact , they are more like the Elizabethans ? also , they embrace something of the seventeenth-century metaphysic . In their hands , the novel takes a poetic trend . Is this because we live in an age of ideas and passions . in which individual destinies count for less , in which people take less colour from their surroundings because those surroundings change from day to day ? One great war has already left , and now another has also placed , its mark on English habit , feeling and thought . I do not think English essentials will ever change  --  but events make us sharply conscious of what these are . The novelist to-day must think for himself : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So the English novel gains in self-consciousness  --  - it may have lost some of the old spontaneity . I can not see my contemporaries as I see the earlier novelists : that is , I can not see them down the perspective of time . They are many , and 268 vitally on the move . To attempt to judge them would be to attempt to immobilise them . I may have been arbitrary about the dead ; I will not be misleading about the living . With every day , values go up and down . So I shall close with a reference only to two modern novelists whose work seems to me to have attained a position clear of the daily critical flux . One , Virginia Woolf , is recently dead ; the other , E. M. Forster , has not published a novel since 1924 . These two seem to me both to epitomise English tradition and to have moved forward along lines of their own . E. M. Forster 's novels are more straightforward , more ( at least apparently ) in the familiar manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they give place ( though not the first place ) to character ; they have a high ironic level of comedy , and their dialogue comes abreast with Jane Austen 's . What is new in them is their particular mental climate ; also , the nature of other people 's predicaments . Contrast does much to give these novels structure and meaning ? contrast between one country , with its inherent spirit , and another ( suburban England and hill-269 town Italy in Where Angels Fear to Tread , between England and India in A Passage to India ) , between convention and passion ( in A Room with a View ) , between illusion and truth ( in The Longest journey and Howard 's End ) . In each , the central character is kept at the high tension of a continuous decision . Through experience the character seems to make a journey ? an often lonely destination is reached . The controlled , level style of the narration can be penetratingly beautiful . In Virginia Woolf 's novels the characters are less mobile ; they seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The men and women have an intense inner existence ; each generates his or her own world . Imagination of this pure power has not been brought to narrative style before : Virginia Woolf has been likened to Sterne  --  but her imagination is less contused than his . I have not heard her compared with Emily Bronte  --  but Emily Bronte has been the only other woman capable of this upward sweep . While the Wuthering Heights setting is in itself extraordinary , Virginia Woolf 's choice of settings has been the reverse , and her characters are , in their outward aspects , made almost deliberately tame . She chooses , in fact , unlikely matter to kindle ? but , once kindled , how high she makes it burn ! She has put behind her , having no need of , devices that make all other stories work . The towering inner strangeness of her people appears not at all in their outward actions ( which appear conventional and compliant ) , but in the manner in which they see and feel . Only in the earliest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually make a journey : they go to South America . Otherwise , they are confined to the experiences of London , the English countryside and seashore . But never before has England appeared as it appears under this burningglass of her art . Once , in Orlando , she turns the glass on the English past . Otherwise , all her titles  --  Night and Day , Jacob 's Room , Mrs. Dalloway , To the Lighthouse , The Waves , The Years , Between the Acts ? suggest the familiar " now " ? the familiar scene , in cycles of light and darkness , in hearing of the rhythm of tides . Time , not passion , spins any plot that there is ? and yet Virginia Woolf has been supreme in her power to place the life art touches beyond the power of time . I have tried , as I promised at the start of this book , to make felt the wideness of the To-day of art , and return past novelists to their place in its light . So it is fitting to close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as wrote in the presence of that To-day . BRITISH PHILOSOPHERS KENNETH MATTHEWS I T WO major influences have shaped the philosophy of modern Europe : the British and the German . It is true that Descartes , who is generally regarded as the founder of modern European philosophy , was a Frenchman and Spinoza , the saintly , Ghandi-like refugee who polished lenses and discoursed with princes , was a Spanish Jew . No science can be confined behind national frontiers . But just as in Ancient Greece an extraordinary coruscation of intellectual curiosity took place in a brief period and within the limits of a single language , so in Britain a tradition of philosophy arose and flourished , having its special native characteristics ; and so in Germany a rival succession of philosophers flourished in their turn , following different gods . The native characteristics of British philosophy are these : common sense , dislike of complication , a strong preference for the concrete over the abstract and a certain awkward honesty of method in which an occasional pearl of poetry is embedded . It is as easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Locke and Bertrand Russell as in the seamanship of Francis Drake and Horatio Nelson . We might vainly enquire whether climate or language or some original hereditary strain or a combination of all three produces the distinguishing marks of national character , but their existence can not be denied . The British philosophers , at least the most typical of them , stand with both feet on the ground . They are , compared with the great German system builders , Kant , Hegel , Leibniz and the others , earthbound and pedestrian figures . But then , they would say , a sound philosophy is a utility product , which must be capable of taking hard knocks . A crucial incident in the history of European philosophy was the discovery of David Hume by Immanuel Kant . The German philosopher 271 : ells us in a memorable phrase that he was suddenly " awakened from his dogmatic slumbers . " We do not know which of FIume 's books provoked his event , nor exactly when it happened . It was probably one of the passages in the Treatise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of causation , which struck Kant as somehow darkly anarchic and led him to create the elaborate philosophic structure of the Critique of Pure Reason . It would be too much to attribute all the ambitious philosophic systems which were evolved by German philosophers after Kant to the seed sown in Kant 's mind by the Scottish philosopher . There are fashions in philosophy , as in everything else ; and in the Romantic Period , people were ready for philosophies in the romantic spirit and on a romantic scale . The fellow-countrymen of Wagner supplied them . They had their influence in the world ; and they had their imitators in Britain . But when a philosophy erected like Kant 's or Hegel 's , tier upon tier of abstract superstructure upon a pinpoint of experience , falls out of fashion , it falls like Lucifer , never to rise again . The philosophy which touches the ground at many points has a much greater survival value . Moreover , common sense is not a dull quality . Rather the contrary . Nothing is more calculated to shock people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was the indiscretion which long ago put a cup of hemlock in front of Socrates . The British philosophers provoked the same reactions , but on the whole did not go to the same lengths of contumacy . Sir Thomas More was the only one to lose his life and that for annoying the King rather than writing Utopia . Thomas Hobbes , the truculent author of Leviathan , went more often to church when a Bill denouncing his famous work as blasphemous literature was introduced in Parliament . Locke went into exile , as Socrates might have done ; his Letter of Toleration was published in Holland . Hume , than whom no man lived a more blameless life , ensconced in his Edinburgh house , with his sister , maid and cat , was regarded with such distrust that hostile demonstrations were expected at his funeral ; and on the advice of his friends , he kept the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion unpublished during his lifetime . Undoubtedly a certain mellowing in the public attitude towards philosophic speculation was taking place even at that time ; philosophers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modifying their professional status . But it was still possible for Jeremy Bentham to horrify the Romantic Age by the classical simplicity of the Utilitarian doctrine : the greatest happiness of the greatest number . John Stuart Mill tells us how he read Bentham in his teens with an effect of revelation ; and no doubt ( though this is not recorded ) there were murmurings in conservative households that Mr. Bentham must have picked up these immoral ideas during his travels in Russia . Bentham journeyed to Russia and wrote one of his books in the form of letters from Russia . We have noted the practical spirit of British 272 philosophy ; and it should not surprise us to find that the philosophers themselves were practical men . Men of affairs would be an even juster description . Two of them , Francis Bacon and Thomas More , occupied the office of Lord Chancellor ; hence Harvey 's celebrated taunt , that Bacon wrote philosophy like a Lord Chancellor . Locke was offered the post of Ambassador at Vienna or Berlin ; and actually filled the offices of Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commissioner of Trade and Plantations . Berkeley spent ten years of his life on a plan for a college in the Bermudas , whose purpose would be " ; he reformation of manners among the English in our Western plantations and the propagation of the Gospel among the American savages " ; and if the project never matured , it must be recorded that a grant of money was made by the almost unanimous vote of the House of Commons . Bentham was one of the pioneers of British prison reform . J. S. Mill was for twenty years in charge of the East India Company 's relations with the Indian native states . Those philosophers who , like Hume , had none but literary ambitions , regarded philosophy not as an end in itself , but as a foundation of other researches ; they concerned themselves with history , social problems , economics and theories of government . We may conclude either that the common sense which we have mentioned as a characteristic of British philosophers derives from this catholic experience , or that both philosophy and experience derive from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old Greek word meant simply " love of wisdom . " In the popular sense , philosophy means any deeply reflective study of abstract subjects , like God or Beauty . In this sense the poets are philosophers ; and Browning and Wordsworth are more philosophic than Herrick or Keats . This opinion seems to me to be true as far as it goes . But in a narrow sense philosophy means what Aristotle first called metaphysics . By metaphysics we understand the science which supplies the answer to the question : what is the nature of the universe ; or to break up the subject into its component terms , what is space , what is time , what is the mind of man made of , what is the difference between mind and matter , what do we mean when we say that a thing exists , and so on . Closely associated with metaphysics , we have ethics , which purports to answer the question : what is the Good and how ought man to behave ; and logic , which is the formal analysis of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dividing line exists enclosing philosophy on one side and non-philosophy on the other . There is rather a progress from questions which are felt to be absolutely fundamental and secondary questions which arise therefrom . Like most living things , philosophy does not easily submit to academic definitions . But it will probably be most useful if we think of philosophy mainly in the narrow metaphysical sense but without altogether excluding the more generous interpretations . 273 II SOME of the most remarkable relics in England are the churches and monasteries surviving among the Northumbrian shipyards from the days of the Venerable Bede . We shall not claim Bede as a philosopher , although he died like one , surrounded by weeping disciples and dictating the last words of his English translation of the Gospel of St. John . Small , isolated communities like Bede 's kept a candle burning in Britain during the early Middle Ages . But the centres of learning were on the Continent of Europe : the Frankish Courts , the Vatican , the University of Paris . Charlemagne wanted to see the intellectual life of Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Caliph of the Arabian world , he called scholars from south , north , east and west , including Alcuin from Britain . We shall not call Alcuin a philosopher ; nor yet Erigena , who travelled from Ireland to the Court of Charles the Bald . Both were theologians , for whom philosophy was one of God 's handmaids , subject both to divine discipline and original sin . All through the Middle Ages you were allowed to philosophise only if your conclusions served to buttress the current dogmas of the Church ; Aristotle , read in Latin translations , was the " set book . " The story of British philosophy is the story of how this ghostly tyranny was broken , how independent thought on fundamental questions was achieved and what it accomplished . We might do worse than begin with the Franciscan mission which landed at Dover on September loth , 1224 , not for the mission 's own sake but because of its connection with Britain 's first full-size philosopher , Roger Bacon . What strange invasions the coast of Kent has seen ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anglo-Saxons , St. Augustine 's little Christian band , and , on this old September Tuesday , the nine friars sent by St. Francis , three of them Englishmen , who journeyed to Lincoln , London and Oxford to set up new standards of scholarship in England . The Franciscan School in Oxford was of especial importance ; there an infant university was arising which was soon to rival Paris , and the Franciscans played a great part in its development . We are told how the friars used to walk barefoot through the cold and wind to attend the Oxford theology classes . They quickly produced philosophers pre-eminent in their generation : Thomas of York , whose Metaphysics was preserved in Italian libraries in Florence and the Vatican ; Friar Robert of Cornwall " whom fools thought wise and wise men crazy " in Roger Bacon 's biting phrase ( he was rash enough to differ from Bacon on a point of logic ! ) ; and Stephen the Englishman who lectured on philosophy in Genoa and Rome and who , when dying , besought his friend to have masses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too often to a certain religious matron , to console her . " 274 Roger Bacon ( Friar Bacon ) joined the Franciscan Order in Paris between Paris and Oxford he divided his life . A prodigious figure ! He has survived in legend as the inventor of gunpowder . Popular opinion s at least right in judging him to be the sort of person who might have Wade this discovery . Popular opinion has also dressed him in a long black lecromancer 's cloak and pictured him concocting nefarious substances in nortars and retorts , rather like that friar whom we have all seen on the stage concocting a death-brew for Romeo . But if we strip off the fancy cress and try to reach an understanding of the man as he really was , we - and only a shrewd , tough , tirelessly inquisitive and irrepressibly argumentative character who lived to a ripe old age and spent a great part of t deliberately shocking people : a figure rather like that of Thomas Hlobbes , though Hobbes seems to have known a little better when to stop . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was twenty . The cast of his mind is shown when he first of all refuses to read Aristotle in the accepted Latin translations , learns to read the original Greek and then declares that if he had his way , every translation of Aristotle would be burned . From Aristotle in Greek he proceeds to the Arabian scientists who , in the mediaeval world , were the natural successors of the Greeks . He turns to " speculative alchemy , " which he presently declares to be one of the three foundations of true science . Here already we have the foundations of the Baconian legend , although Bacon 's " alchemy " was practised in as dispassionate a spirit as modern chemistry . He was known , even among his contemporaries , as the Marvellous Doctor ( Doctor Admirabilis ) . But as he pursued his researches , it is clear that a vision dawned upon him which lifted him clean out of the surrounding world : the vision of man 's future power over nature . He writes of boats which shall be driven without oars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other possible mechanical inventions . At the same time , his contempt for orthodox thought , as practised in the schools of Oxford and Paris , gathers head . He takes , not only his science from the Arabians , but also his invective . He criticises a learned rival in these terms : " His works have four faults . The first is boundless , puerile vanity ; the second is ineffable falsity ; the third is superfluity of bulk .. . and the fourth is ignorance of the most useful and most beautiful parts of philosophy . " The style , which would have delighted the taste of HarounAI-Rachid , fell less gratefully upon the ears of the reverend scholastics of Paris . They shut him up for ten years in 1257 ; he wrote his Opus Majus in prison . Scarcely had he been released when he offended again . His Summary of Philosophical Study , written about 1271 , probably caused the second scandal . At the age of sixty-four , he was summoned before the Chapter of his Order and condemned for " making innovations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The aged philosopher emerged 276 from prison , wrote a book upon theology and died : worthy , if any man ever was , of a philosopher 's grave on British soil . What was the system of philosophy which emerged from this stormy life ? It had two sides , negative and positive . The negative side was the rejection of contemporary methods of reasoning . Mediaeval or " scholastic " philosophy reposed , like modern law , upon precedent ; the truth had been revealed and one had only to refine upon it . Bacon dismissed this philosophy as a compound of four errors : of obsequiousness to authority , ingrained habits of thought , deference to the unlettered crowd and the empty ostentation of knowledge . The positive side of Bacon 's work represents his greatest contribution to philosophy . " There are two modes in which we acquire knowledge , argument and experiment . If any man who had never seen fire were to hear proved by satisfactory argument that fire burns and destroys things , his mind would not rest satisfied , nor would he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combustible thing into it , he proved by actual experiment what the argument laid down ; but after the experiment has been made , his mind receives certainty and rests in the possession of truth . " A thirteeth-century philosopher who proposed to divert his learned colleagues from their transcendental hair-277 splitting to the practical untidy work of the laboratory , was as if a physician in the years of the Great Plague should have told his profession to cease their incantations and look for the germs . We can better appreciate the quality of Roger Bacon by comparing him with another British Franciscan : John Duns Scotus . Duns is a Scottish village lying about halfway between Berwick and Edinburgh , almost on the English border ; here Duns Scotus is said to have been born about the year 1265 . He , like Roger Bacon , studied both in Oxford and in Paris but in all probability missed the influence of the older man . He had spent four years at Paris and at least ten years in Oxford before he began the Oxford lectures on theology in 1300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lectured in Paris ; and as Bacon was termed the Marvellous Doctor , so he earned the name of the Subtle Doctor ( Doctor Subtilis ) , a happy example of popular discernment . He was an infinitely more conventional figure , a true " scholastic , " who took part in the current scholastic controversies . He argued about such matters as " the hylomorphic composition of angels . " The word " dunce " ( from Duns ) indicates the contempt which a later age felt for the whole scholastic tradition . But even Duns Scotus disturbed men 's minds in his time ; it is said that his books were publicly burned in Oxford by his philosophical opponents . In the year of Bacon 's death ( 1294 ) , when Duns Scotus was at the height of his career , we read that the number of foreign students at Oxford was so great that they could not be accommodated in the city . The prestige of English scholarship was already rising fast . Two hundred years later it is no longer surprising when one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at Cambridge that Erasmus first met the author of Utopia ? Sir Thomas More . More is perhaps not strictly a philosopher . He is anima naturaliter philosophica . His Utopia which is a description of an ideal society or commonwealth , must be taken as a profound fable rather than an enquiry into the principles of knowledge . But it shows the new renaissance temper abroad in England , the switch of interest from Aristotle to Plato . And a liberal , even radical spirit of criticism . The citizens of Utopia enjoyed complete religious toleration ; they had " priests of exceeding holiness and therefore very few . " They had a law that those who would marry must approve each other 's naked body before the ceremony was performed . ' They considered war " as a thing very beastly " ; yet their women accompanied their husbands into battle . Utopia was published in 1516 , when More was thirty-eight years old ; and with its old-fashioned Latin dress and new-fangled ideas , it stands as a bridge between Mediaevalism and the Elizabethan Age of Enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first spring , so knowledge derived from Aristotle will at most rise no higher than the 278 knowledge of Aristotle . " This forthright pronouncement occurs in the first philosophical work written in the English language . It demolished in one sentence the whole laboured edifice which had been raised in the Middle Ages . The author was a second Bacon , Francis , later Baron Verulam ; and the work , the Advancement of Learning . The Advancement of Learning was published in 1605 , two years after Queen Elizabeth 's death . It ante-dated by 32 years the publication by 279 Descartes of the Discours sur la Methode , which is conventionally regarded as the fountain-head of modern philosophy . Descartes ' revolutionary method consisted in building up knowledge from the beginning by rejecting every belief which could possibly be doubted ; but Francis Bacon before him had declared : " Our one hope is to begin the whole labour of the mind again . " The Advancement of Learning stands as a landmark , not only in British , but in European philosophical history . Francis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a personal enigma . He , too , trails his clouds of legend . One of the wildest fables which has grown up round his name is that which credits him with the writing of Shakepeare 's plays . This may at least be taken as a tribute to Bacon 's vast intellectual powers . He has said many things worthy of Shakespeare . The magnificent boast : " I have taken all knowledge to be my province " might well have come from the same pen as wrote of the Roman Triumvir : " Why man he doth bestride the narrow world like a Colossus . " Yet , although there is grandeur enough in Bacon , there is little lyricism and less humour . Bacon is at bottom practical . Some of his most memorable sayings are the stuff of politics . Consider this , upon war resources : " The sinews of war are not money ; if the sinews of men 's arms be wanting , they are a soft and effeminate nation . " Or this , upon seapower : " The being master of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to take as much or as little of the war as it pleases , whilst those who are superior in land forces have yet numerous difficulties to struggle with . " How often these words are quoted without regard to the author of them ! The enigma of Francis Bacon resides in his personal character . His public career was stained continually by treachery and self-seeking . He betrayed his friend and patron , the Earl of Essex . Under King James I we see him putting neither his own integrity nor the public good before personal advancement . He schemes for the extension of the King 's Prerogative and the hoodwinking of Parliament at a time when the authority of Parliament was the supreme condition for the further advancement of British liberties . Presented in a certain light , his elaborate machinations to protect the Duke of Buckingham 's monopolies appear more odious than royal tyranny . He achieved his aim of becoming Lord Chancellor but was brought down by his accumulating enemies within three years . He was convicted of taking bribes in the discharge of his judicial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 2,790 ; his actual income was about ? 16,000 . Bacon 's philosophy was that of a man of the world . He says roundly of his system : " The matter in hand is no mere philosophy of speculation , but the real business and fortunes of the human race . " Here , certainly , we have the note , never long absent from our island philosophy , struck with surpassing vigour and boldness . Knowledge for its own sake means 280 nothing to Francis Bacon . Knowledge must be justified by works ; true knowledge means power over nature . It is easy to see how a man who held these views would not readily accept the status of an academic philosopher . He even says in one place , that those who spend their whole lives in writing books do so because they do not realise that there are other easier roads to fame . It is a fantastic coincidence that Francis Bacon should have shared with a thirteenth-century predecessor not only a name but also a great part of his " new method . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human error . He describes Four Idols which delude the human mind : Idols of the Tribe , Idols of the Cave , Idols of the Marketplace and Idols of the Theatre . The word " idols " sounds picturesque ; it is a direct translation from Plato . The Idols of the Tribe are those fallacies which arise from the very structure of men 's minds ; for example when we jump to a general conclusion on the basis of one example . The Idols of the Cave are the errors peculiar to the individual ; for example , when a man thinks a subject is specially important because he himself has studied it . The Idols of the Market are the errors caused by the misleading use of words . Nothing , as we shall see , is more up-todate in Francis Bacon than his analysis of the fallibility of words . He says in one place : " In Physics , where nature is to be caught by works and not the adversary by argument , truth in this way slips through our fingers , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of words . " The Idols of the Theatre are the narrow systems of philosophy which have hitherto gained currency in the world . Bacon says that time is like a river ; it brings the refuse down to us and leaves the solid stuff behind ! Then , too , Francis Bacon , like Roger , bases the new method entirely upon experiment . Philosophers , he says , must become like little children , examining the elements of nature . But ? and this is the startling suggestion  --  nothing else will suffice than the assemblage of all existing instances of the object studied and no generalisation will be valid unless it is based on all the instances . Bacon realises , of course , that a literal interpretation of this method would make all generalisation impossible . He allows a sort of tentative generalisation which he calls , picturesquely , the First Vintage . In this Bacon shows remarkable anticipations of modern thought . The final generalisation , which can be made after the active researches described have been completed , Bacon calls the Form . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to exploit our knowledge and achieve supremacy over nature . Such is the Baconian method or Baconian Induction as it is sometimes called . What Bacon planned was a sequence of six mighty works ; he catalogues them for us in the preface to the Advancement of Learning . A Survey and Extension of the Sciences . This was the Advancement of Learning , // collectively achieved . They broke down any intellectual basis that may we remained for controlling the free exercise of human thought . Hobbes sailed the temporal power of the Church . He was not the first nor the st to denounce ecclesiastical vested interests but he was certainly one of the most effective . Locke 's work on religious and political toleration fastened the powers of civil government . He , like Milton , hated censors , the miserable creatures who imposed a tax of 6/8d. per volume upon a set Cicero imported from Holland . From the sailing of the Mayflower in ) 20 to Flume 's Dialogues upon Natural Religion it is as if a new intellectual climate has descended upon the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reign of scarcely interrupted sunshine . Such a beration based , not on accident , but upon that fundamental effort of sought which we call philosophy , was necessary to the century of science which immediately followed and which the philosopher-pioneers foresaw . To begin , then , with Hobbes . Hobbes as a young man used to walk ith Francis Bacon in his garden . It was the pupil 's task to imprison pon paper the ideas which flowed from the master 's conversation ; and e hear that his lordship " better liked Mr. Hobbes taking his thoughts ran any of the others because he understood what he wrote . " But Hobbes as not the man to remain a taker-down of other people 's thoughts for Eng . He was what is called in the vernacular a " character . " His inrdinate vanity , his eye darting like a " live bright coal , " his endless isputatiousness , combined with a rare capacity for friendship , caused eople to take sides for and against him even though they had never read is works . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hated ishops and all persons of unnatural unction . He was a confirmed bachelor , lough he is said to have had an illegitimate daughter whom he referred to as his delictum juventutis . He was still publishing his latest philosophic iscoveries at the age of ninety . He lived to be ninety-one . He was . the George Bernard Shaw of his day . Hobbes was by no means born into philosophy . He was lucky to get ay education at all . His father was a disreputable country parson . One unday , after playing cards all night , he startled his congregation by waking from a snooze in the pulpit and shouting : " Spades are trumps ! " resently , after a brawl at the church door , he disappeared , deserting his tinily . An uncle sent the young Hobbes to Oxford , where he distinguished himself in Latin and Greek . Then , after leaving Oxford , he secured a tutorship which shaped his whole life ? in the family of Lord Cavendish , later first Earl of Devonshire . He never broke his friendship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ancestral homes of Chatsworth and Hardwicke ; through them he met the Kings of Europe and , lore important , the great scholars , Descartes , Galileo . He was over forty efore that critical incident occurred which has , perhaps , been somewhat verdramatised . " By God ! " says he , looking at a proposition of Euclid 284 in a friend 's book , " this is impossible ! " But following the proof from proposition to proposition , he becomes convinced and begins to dream of establishing a philosophical system as logical and remorseless as Euclid 's geometry . This philosophy took on a political bias because , says Hobbes , the country was " boiling hot with political questions , the forerunners of an approaching war . " ' The philosophy he wanted to write would have been in three parts : the first dealing with matter , the second with human nature and the third with society . Actually he carried out something like this plan ; only in the stress of the Civil War , he wrote the last part first . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great monuments of the English language . The first part of the system , the analysis of matter , was developed in a later book De Corpore , written in Latin ; and much of what Hobbes had to say about human nature was telescoped into Leviathan and an earlier work upon the social organisation of man De Cive . Hobbes was , in the strict philosophical sense , a materialist . He believed that nothing existed except matter ? matter in motion . Just as he ascribed the phenomena of Nature to the ceaseless motion of its elements , so he thought he could reduce all human affairs to " the internal motions of men " ; he was an exponent of that oldest Greek philosophy which dismissed all reality in the words iravra peb ? everything flows . Something in the primeval iconoclasm of this doctrine appealed to Hobbes ' temperament . Hobbes wrote to hurt and counted nothing well said which did not strike a telling blow against someone or something . Consider some of his typical pronouncements . That the first passion which inclines men to peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rule by terror . That the only difference between monarchy and tyranny or between democracy and anarchy resides in the outlook of the governed . That liberty consists in submission to the monarch . That the prosperity of a people depends , not on their form of government , but on their obedience , and that those who preach disobedience and revolution as a means to reform are like the daughters of Peleus who , desiring to renew the youth of their decrepit father , cut him in pieces and boiled him but made not of him a new man . That a man may deny the true God at the command of his sovereign , because profession with the tongue is but an external thing . That a king must either rule or be ruled by the Pope because the distinction of temporal and spiritual power is but words . And so on . These are some of the findings of Leviathan , in which the essence of Hobbes ' thought is concentrated . Leviathan is the name given by Hobbes to the " mortal power " exercised by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be summarised quite simply : it is that the natural man , swayed only by selfish passions , must be for ever at war with his fellows unless he contracts to submit to Leviathan , that is , to a sovereign , conceived as an absolute and external power . The contract is cemented by fear . The 286 reduction of all human activities to selfish elements is so ruthlessly urged and argued , with such savage excursions against certain social groups , like the clergy and the universities , that parts of Leviathan read like a forerunner of Freud 's analytical psychology , and parts like a Shaw preface . The book was published in 1651 to greet the first years of Cromwell 's dictatorship . It was not unacceptable to the rulers of the Restoration . But of the opinion of the mass of the people we can perhaps best judge by the fact that , after the Great Plague of 1665 when God 's displeasure became a matter of public enquiry and concern , Leviathan narrowly escaped suppression by Act of Parliament . Hobbes ' unorthodoxy flashed like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a new star among the constellations which has never ceased to light men 's way . Locke was nineteen years old when Leviathan was published . His Two Treatises of Government were directed , not against Hobbes , but against a lesser disciple of Hobbes , Sir Robert Filmer ; yet ever and again , by a turn of phrase or a pointed allusion , Locke shows himself conscious of the older master-spirit . I take the innermost essence of Locke 's political philosophy to be contained in this proposition : " He who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him . " This superb declaration may be found in the seventeenth paragraph of the second Treatise . From this follows Locke 's view of monarchy , that whereever the King may be found exercising absolute power over his subjects , whether he be called the Czar or the Grand Signior , such a society is the most primitive possible . From this follows the memorable dictum which justifies war and in extreme cases revolution : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed ? To this I answer , that force is to be opposed to nothing but to unjust and to unlawful forces . " Locke held the very moderate view that government was a responsibility delegated by the community for the purpose of protecting each member 's life and property . Its function was to safeguard , not to restrict , the liberty of the individual . The Epistle on Toleration ( Epistola de Tolerantia , one of the last English philosophical works to be published in Latin ) carried the same theme ; and if , as is sometimes pointed out , he himself failed to tolerate Papists and Atheists , he surely hastened the day of their toleration . Locke , too , had a sounder initiation into government than Hobbes , the tutor of earls and princes . He was born in a cottage . He was by turns doctor , university professor , diplomat , civil servant ; and he was turned out of a university post by one of the arbitrary acts of King James II . When the revolution broke out , Locke had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same ship which carried the Princess Mary and was invited to become William of Orange 's Ambassador to one of the German capitals , Berlin and Vienna . Nothing is more revealing of Locke 's personal character than the letter in which he declined this employment . 2117 What is most serious in the letter is too long to he quoted ; but like Ambassador Dodd of the United States , apprehensive of the summons to adapt himself to the habits of the Nazi leaders , Locke takes alarm at the German reputation for hard drinking . " It is no small matter in such stations to he acceptable to the people one has to do with , in being able to accommodate oneself to their fashions . I should think it more for the King 's interest to send a man of equal parts that could drink his share than the soberest man in the kingdom . " Modest , efficient , scholarly , democratic ( his father fought in the Civil War on the Parliament side ) these qualities would have inevitably ranged him against Hobbes , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters and the kindred work Some Thoughts Concerning Education in which he makes many practical and modern-sounding suggestions for forming the minds of children . They would never explain that towering intellectual achievement , the first full study of the nature and limits of philosophic knowledge in modern times , the Essay on Human Understanding . Locke came to this by a sort of revelation . The scene was such a one as Plato often describes and Locke 's description of it is strikingly similar . Five or six of his friends were talking in his room about morality and religion . " It came into my thoughts that we took a wrong course , and that before we set ourselves upon enquiries of that nature , it was necessary to examine our abilities and see what objects our understandings were , or were not , fitted to deal with . " Locke parted from his friends that night with the promise that he would write down his thoughts upon these first principles . The task took him nearly twenty years . What Locke did was to map the human mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coasted patiently from bay to bay , measuring distances , dropping his plummet into every firth and inlet and , on occasion , making exploratory forays into the interior . The immense and original labour which Locke performed opened up a new philosophical continent . None of his successors but was constrained at some time or another to say : " John Locke travelled this way before me " ; they acknowledged his achievement by the glee with which they corrected a detail here and there in his plan. * Locke made certain large assumptions . He called all the objects of the human understanding ideas and treated them neutrally . That is to say , seeing a tree and thinking about God were both ideas , according to Locke ; and it was wildly exhilarating in the seventeenth century that anyone should hold the balance so evenly before dropping two such traditionally uneven ideas upon the scales . Next , he regarded the mind as a blank upon which the ideas were imposed , like pictures on a screen . There were no such things as innate ideas ; all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , the compound and abstract ones , had been worked up by the mind , as raw material is worked up into a complex finished product . Perhaps his most characteristic assumption was that the ideas sit somewhere midway between the mind and the external world . This is the very battleground of philosophy , the question what is the relation between the mind and its ideas and between ideas and external things . Locke said that the ideas were " in the mind " and that some ideas " resembled " external things ; that was as far as he went into the matter . But one can not in the same voyage circumnavigate a continent and trace all its rivers to the source . He takes his ideas , then , and examines them from various angles , holds them up to the light , so to speak . First , he classifies them according to their origins . Ideas originate from sensation or reflection or both . The ideas of sensation are , of course , the shapes , colours , tastes and smells which come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the sun . We have various ideas of roundness , whiteness , and heat : all simple ideas of sensation . The roundness is a primary quality , resembling something in the sun ; because although it may not be the real size and shape of the sun , yet the sun has some size and shape . The whiteness and heat are secondary qualities , because these are wholly begotten upon the mind by the senses and neither they nor anything like them exist in the sun . The distinction which Locke made between primary and secondary qualities stirred up a philosophic controversy which has lasted to this day . The ideas of reflection appear when our mental faculties of memory , willpower , discernment , knowledge and so on begin to work upon the raw material of sensation . When we remember the sun and when we deliberately think of the sun , we have simple ideas of reflection . When we bask in the sun , we have an idea of pleasure ; when we are blistered by the sun , we have an idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sensation and reflection mixed . We come next to the complex ideas . The sun is , of course , itself a complex idea ; it is an idea of something which is at once round and white and hot . The mind constantly builds collections of qualities like these into ideas of substance , from which is finally built our idea of the world of nature . It compares one idea with another to produce ideas of relations ; for example , we say " Queen Elizabeth lived 69 years , " an idea which we get by comparing the duration of one substance ( Queen Elizabeth ) with 69 annual revolutions of another substance ( the sun ) . The mind also has the power of abstraction , that is to say , it can combine ideas regardless of their relations with things . The ancients produced their idea of a Sun God by combining the ideas of the sun and of a very powerful man . Locke rightly saw that language itself is an act of abstraction and that to call every leaf on every tree in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negation of language , because no man would understand what another was saying . There is a very modern spirit in the way Locke bases much of his reasoning on the behaviour of animals and young children . He reminds // us in one passage how children invent their own words to represent their real ideas of things , reversing the habit of parsons and schoolmasters who repeat other men 's gibberish with the utmost persuasiveness in spite of the fact that it represents nothing really existing in nature . After assembling the contents of the mind ( and no brief summary could so much as suggest the vigour and richness of the detail ) , Locke asks : " What is knowledge and how much can we be said to know ? " To the first question : " What is knowledge ? " he answers that knowledge consists in the agreement which we perceive between our ideas , or the agreement which we perceive between our ideas and reality . We know that two plus two equals four because this idea agrees with all other ideas and never comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fifty . We know that the sun exists because our idea of the sun agrees with something real in the outside world . Locke held that knowledge of substances , that is to say , the outside world , was very incomplete . We knew substances only through sensation ; and to find out that the sun hardened mud but melted wax required patient observation and experiment . Beyond the region of our certain knowledge , said Locke , stretched a twilight region in which the judgment operated . We could judge of many things which we did not know , but only on probability . Of the pitfalls which beset the fallible judgment of man , Locke tells a story which he must have heard with delight during his residence in Holland . The Dutch Ambassador to the Court of Siam was trying to explain to the Siamese King how the northern rivers froze in winter time ; the ice was so thick , he said , that an elephant could stand on it . But the King of Siam , applying his own system of probabilities , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a liar . Locke put the problem of knowledge upon a psychological basis . Indeed the Essay may be read as the first great study in analytical psychology . It has , as we have already indicated , a truly superb completeness . It is not hard to lose one 's way in the Essay ; but it is extremely hard to find any point which Locke has entirely neglected . Many of the criticisms of Locke fail before the simple fact that Locke himself answered them , but in a different place . This applies not only to the criticisms of the egregious Bishop of Worcester , to whom Locke made three public rejoinders , but even to Berkeley and Hume who owed to Locke the main body of their theses . The Essay must , in fact , be one of the world 's hardest books to index properly . Locke is not over logical . He will never force a fact to fit his theory . Locke 's habit of walking round his subject and commenting on it from various directions makes for occasional inconsistencies , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominated by the intense conviction that philosophy is for use , not for empty debate . If knowledge be a sun , let us work in sunlight ; if a candle , by candlelight : but let us work ! 290 The Bishop of Worcester 's fears were not unjustified . The young took up the New Philosophy with enthusiasm , even the future bishops . A twenty-year old theological student of Trinity College , Dublin , organised a study-circle to discuss the Essay on Human Understanding . It was George Berkeley , later Bishop of Cloyne . This engaging young Irishman  --   --  for that he was engaging we have more tangible evidence than his charm of style ? believed that he could resolve the difficulties and uncertainties of the famous Essay by a single stroke of intuition . In 1710 , when he was only twenty-five , he published the Principles of Human Knowledge . His three best-known philosophical works , the Theory of Vision , the Principles and the Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous were all written before he ' 291 was thirty . After that , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his later books , which mix Christian apologetics and Platonic mysticism , are of interest only to the specialist . What was the young man 's inspiration which was to make all Locke plain sailing ? Berkeley assailed the New Philosophy at its weakest point , the junction between the idea , which Locke said was in the mind , and the thing which the idea represented and which was assumed to exist in a world outside the mind . Why , asked Berkeley , if all that the mind knows is its own ideas , do we assume that an outside world exists at all ? " Some truths there are so near and obvious to the mind that a man need only open his eyes to see them . Such I take this important one to be , that all the choir of heaven and furniture of the earth , in a word , all those bodies which compose the mighty frame of the world , have not any subsistence without a mind , that their being is to be perceived , that , consequently , so long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist in my mind or that of any other created spirit , they must either have no existence at all or else subsist in the mind of some external spirit . " Two amusing comments on Berkeley 's theory may be recalled . One of them is the immortal anecdote about Doctor Johnson . " After we came out of church , " says Boswell , " we stood for some time talking of Bishop Berkeley 's ingenious sophistry to prove the non-existence of matter , and that everything in the universe is merely ideal . I observed that , though we are satisfied his doctrine is not true , it is impossible to refute it . I shall never forget the alacrity with which Johnson answered , striking his foot with mighty force against a large stone , till he rebounded from it : " I refute it thus It may be pointed out in Johnson 's defence that Bertrand Russell borrows the essential part of his argument when , after observing that Berkeley is " very hard to refute , " he adds that his commonsense revolts against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributed to an Oxford professor : " There was a young man who said God Must find it exceedingly odd That this sycamore tree Just ceases to be When there 's no-one about in the Quad ' . " This limerick , like the equally celebrated one about Einstein 's Theory of Relativity , is unfair . Berkeley never maintained that the sycamore tree simply ceased to exist when there was no-one looking at it . What he said was that the " matter " or " substance " or whatever was supposed to cause the greenness of the leaves and the jagged shape of the branches and to persist when there was no image of a sycamore in any mind did not exist at all or at any time . But the whole sensible world of Nature did exist , not only during the transient perceptions of men , but also permanently , 292 in the ideas of God . Nature was a manifestation of God 's ideas ; and there are passages in Berkeley which approximate to the extreme Spinozan view , that Nature is God . Berkeley is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very pure form of a theory which constantly recurs in philosophic literature under the general title of Idealism . This theory represents the Universe as of mental stuff and is opposed to Materialism , which represents the Universe as basically material and derives all mental phenomena from the motions and properties of matter . Hobbes was an out-and-out Materialist ; Berkeley an equally thoroughgoing Idealist . The key work is the Principles from which we have already quoted the key-passage . Second ranks Hylas and Philonous , in which the three main ingredients of his lifework are all attractively deployed : the Idealist theory , which was his own ; the arguments , which were broadly Locke 's ; and the manner which was Plato 's . Philonous : Can any doctrine be true that necessarily leads a man into an absurdity ? Hylas : Without doubt it can not . Philonous : Is it not an absurdity to think that the same thing should be at the same time both cold and warm ? Hylas : It is . Philonous : Suppose now one of your hands hot and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put into the same vessel of tepid water , will not the water seem cold to one hand and warm to the other ? Hylas : It will . Philonous : Ought we not therefore by your principles to conclude it is really both cold and warm at the same time , that is , according to your own concession , to believe an absurdity ? Berkeley makes a brilliant splash upon the pages of British philosophy but with a talent which shines , perhaps , a little too smooth and easy against Locke 's rugged genius . Hume rounded off the Great Age . The Treatise of Human Nature , which was to jerk all European philosophy into a new groove , ripened as young as Berkeley 's masterpiece . It was begun in 1734 when Hume was twenty-three and finished three years later . If he had not written it then , the world would almost certainly have lost it altogether , for Flume craved for popular fame and when he discovered that philosophy did not bring it , he turned to other subjects . In later years he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fallen that he set himself to rewrite it in a more popular style . Such are the aberrations to which even the most powerful mind is liable . Hume was of a simple , generous , gentle nature  --  - sharper in his writings than in his dealings with mankind . His friend Adam Smith , the author of The Wealth of Nations , declared after Hume 's death that he was an example 293 of the wise and good man . Yet there was a ruling vanity in Hume which , if less assertive and angular than that of Hobbes , at least suffices to make his virtues interesting . It may be seen in the brief autobiographical sketch he left behind him , My Own Life ; and his letters from Paris , describing the compliments which the Dauphin and Madame de Pompadour showered upon him , are models of eighteenth-century complacency . Poor Hume , who wrote to Hippolyte , Comtesse de Boufflers : " Commonsense requires that I should keep at a distance from all attachments that can imply passion ! " Not Gibbon himself spurned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life is what we should call nowadays a literary success-story . Hume spent his mature powers upon three massive English Histories and fitted in , so to speak , his occasional digressions into Philosophy and Religion . Twice he held public appointments . From 1746 to 1748 he was aide-decamp to General St. Clair . He took part in a " Commando " raid against L'Orient on the coast of Brittany . He also accompanied a British Military Mission to the Courts of Vienna and Turin ; he has left in his letters a fascinating account of the Court of Maria Theresa , the goitre in the Bavarian valleys , the lovely Slovene countryside and his homage at Virgil 's birthplace . Then from 1763 to 1765 he was Secretary to the Embassy in Paris , for a few months actually Charge d'Affaires . He presents these two episodes of public service as interruptions in a scholar 's life ; and he comments here and there upon royalties and copyright payments in the modern manner . He is very conscious of his " public . " At first they reject him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all goes right in the end . The Treatise of Hunan Nature " fell dead-born from the press " ; but in the final years " the copy-money given me by the booksellers much exceeded anything formerly known in England . " The great Treatise has the marks of youth upon it . It begins weakly . There is a sort of insolence in places  --  much talk of " profound reasoning , " a gulf like a caste-system fixed between " philosophic " and " vulgar " minds , no acknowledgment of the debt to Locke , of which the most casual reader must be instantly conscious . For Hume takes over entire that part of Locke 's system which atomises the mind into ideas , except that he calls Locke 's ideas of sensation impressions . He even attempts a superficial catalogue of his ideas and impressions in the Lockian manner . But these are preliminary hesitations : we are soon to launch once more into uncharted seas . We are going to apply Locke 's psychological method with a subtlety and accuracy for which Locke had no time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrunk . Ideas , such as the abstract one of " humanity , " differ from impressions , such as " seeing the sun , " only because the idea is faint and the impression vivid and strong . The fact that I believe that the sun exists , while I do not believe that " humanity " in the abstract exists , is , for Hume , simply a sign of the 294 vividness of the impression as against the idea ? certainly not a proof of the existence of a physical sun . If any impression or idea strikes in on our minds with particular force , we are said to believe it ; this , according to Hume , is all that knowledge means . And further : we believe what we believe out of habit . For example , when we believe that the sun will rise to-morrow , our belief is simply a strong idea , based upon the habit of observing the sun rise upon innumerable morrows in the past . Thus , for all natural laws , based on the operation of cause and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on habit . It was this destructive criticism of the idea of cause which set Kant 's mind working . For if one could not be , but only feel , certain that the sun would rise next day , it would seem that all science was illusory and indeed impossible . 295 We have no space here to follow the Treatise along all its ramifications . But to take a specimen of Hume 's method : his treatment of the problem of the external world . Locke had , as we have seen , assumed that there was an external world , corresponding in some respects to our ideas of it . Berkeley had declared that there was no need to assume an external world at all at least , not in the usual sense of the term . Hume said : since philosophers agree that all we can know is our own ideas and since we are not in direct contact with the external world at any point , how do we come by this extraordinary notion ? Note the form of the question  --   --  not how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come by it . Well , the philosopher looks at his desk and papers ; here they are , here they were yesterday and the day before . He looks at the fire ; it certainly has sunk since he last looked at it , but by natural degrees , so that it is visibly " the same fire . " From these observations , Hume concludes that when certain impressions return to us , either unchanged ( like the desk ) or with expected and coherent changes ( like the fire ) , our imagination ( like a boat which continues in movement when the oars are lifted ) insists on filling in the spaces between the interrupted impressions and making one identical object out of them . Hume then refines upon this analysis . Where do we get this idea of " one identical object ? " The only identical object of which we have experience is an uninterrupted perception . ( Hume now uses Berkeley 's word " perception " instead of his own " impression " ) . If , now , we have a succession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun " on several occasions ) and if imagination fills in the gaps between them , we still only have one identical perception , not an external object . But a human mind , according to Hume , is simply a bundle or chain of perceptions ( how close we are to modern forms of mental theory at this point ) ; so there is no difficulty in supposing that perceptions may go on existing outside the mind . This , in fact , is exactly what the imagination does suppose when it jumps the gap between similar perceptions ; and " external object " is simply the name we give to these imaginatively externalised perceptions . Finally , we believe in external objects because the strong feeling which accompanies our perceptions is communicated to the figment which fills the gaps , as the lover who kisses his mistress 's handkerchief feels the same passion as when he kisses her lips . The upshot of the argument is to destroy our belief in external objects altogether . The second part of the Treatise deals more specifically with human nature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the emotions of pride and humility . Flume , like Hobbes , considers that the motives which activate human behaviour are essentially selfish ; but unlike Hobbes , he finds room for an emotion of benevolence or sympathy . This part of the Treatise , somewhat neglected nowadays , is very important in philosophical history for its influence upon Jeremy Bentham and J. S. Mill . Similarly , the Dialogues on Natural Religion are important as the fore-296 runners of Victorian free thought and agnosticism . In these Dialogues , Hume chiefly assails that celebrated " argument from design " which attempts to prove the existence of God by the evidence of divine handiwork in the world of nature . He comes to the apparently cynical conclusion that the difference of opinion between the theist and the atheist is only a verbal one . It is a dispute , not about facts , but about degrees , as one might dispute whether Cleopatra was a beautiful or a very beautiful woman . The theist and the atheist have no deeper quarrel about the Universe , for if the one calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomprehensible . Yet Hume 's very negativeness and scepticism have an underlying fire and passion . I still remember how , as a young man , I lay one evening on the river-bank at Cambridge , reading the last pages of the metaphysical section of the Treatise , while the summer sun climbed down ; and how I stared over the golden fields , inundated with despair that all was illusion , that nothing could be surely known . And at the same time I felt a surge of exultation that any man should have plumbed the very abyss of doubt and that I should have followed him there . No modern thinker touches like Hume that nerve of the spirit which caused Alcibiades to say of philosophy that it stings like a viper when it gets hold of a young and not insensitive mind . " The intense view of these manifold contradictions and imperfections in human reason has so wrought upon me , and heated my brain , that I am ready to reject all belief and reasoning , and can look upon no opinion even as more probable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? From what causes do I derive my existence , and to what condition shall I return ? Whose favour shall I court , and whose anger must I dread ? What beings surround me ? and on whom have I any influence , or who have any influence on me i I am confounded with all these questions , and begin to fancy myself in the most deplorable condition imaginable , environed with the deepest darkness , and utterly deprived of the use of every member and faculty . " Hume is a protagonist of the eighteenth-century cult of Reason . Gibbon , the arch-sceptic , had still to reach his prime  --  Gibbon who said that a letter of praise from Hume overpaid him for ten years of work . But this quotation from the First Book of the Treatise belongs rather to the succeeding age . It has more than a little in common with the poet who wrote : " ' T is we , who , lost in stormy visions , keep With phantoms an unprofitable strife , And in mad trance strike with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age when even philosophy was required to become romantic . 297 FIFER Flume , the Muse of Philosophy transferred her main residence across the Rhine . Naked and unashamed she would go no longer ; she developed a taste for showy dress . Kant , Fichte , Hegel , Schopenhauer and Nietzsche  --  these were the prophets of the new order . In modern times , when the pendulum has 298 swung back again , it is not easy to do them justice . All dabbled in the prophetic extravagance ; and some went in up to their necks . They did not proceed by simple observation ; they thought they could dredge up truth by devising new logical implements . Kant , for example , argued like this : space must be infinite ; space can not be infinite ; therefore space does not exist in the real world . He arrived at a real world peopled only by Noumena , beings more unreal than any imagined by any other philosopher . Did these German philosophers make any permanent contribution to their science to match their immense contemporary prestige @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in essence , is the Critique of Pure Reason but a restatement of Berkeley 's Idealism in more laboured terms , with the Noumena replacing God ? According to Bertrand Russell , Kant was a philosophic disaster ! In Britain we have , first , a period of applied philosophy . The metaphysical enquiries of the Great Age had cleared men 's minds , even if they had not entirely satisfied them ; and Adam Smith , Jeremy Bentham , John Stuart Mill and Herbert Spencer , like generals who have got a secure base of operations , all crossed that indeterminate frontier which divides pure philosophy from the social sciences . Then came the full impact of the German philosophy . Carlyle was one of its chief missionaries in England . A generation of British philosophers wrote volumes entitled A Text-Book to Kant , The Secret of Hegel , and so on . ' F. H. Green 's Prolegomena ( 1883 ) and F. H. Bradley 's Appearance and Reality ( 1893 ) marked the climax and close of this period . Adam Smith ( 1723-1790 ) was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moral Philosophy at Glasgow , resigned this post after twelve years in order to travel , and in 1776 , the year of Hume 's death , published The Wealth of Nations . No philosophic work so simple in form , so immense in scope , had been written in English since Locke 's Essay . It was the world 's first full-length study of the foundations of an industrial society . Leeds , Halifax , Sheffield , Birmingham and Wolverhampton already shadow forth their giant mechanised future ; and France , Spain , the New World , India and China all supply the author with examples and arguments . Smith believed in free trade . He believed that every man 's desire to better his condition would ensure continuous economic progress , if all artificial obstructions were removed . In this book of 1776 you will find a concrete plan for universal elementary education , based on the existing Scottish system of parish schools . What is said on the subject of philosophy is interesting . Smith thought that philosophy took a wrong turn when , under the influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( science ) , moral philosophy ( ethics ) and logic was abandoned in favour of metaphysics . For the ancient division conformed to the nature of things , but metaphysics was a " cobweb science " of churchmen 's disputations. 299 London bred Jeremy Bentham ( 1i48-1832 ) , as Well as several generations of Bentham 's before him . His father was a prominent member of the Scriveners ' Company , well-to-do ; and Jeremy was that alarming thing , an infant prodigy . At the advanced age of three he was to be observed poring over Rapin 's History of England ; at five he wrote Latin and had already been nicknamed " Philosopher " ; at eight he spoke French and resorted to Voltaire for light reading . As might be expected , he was a delicate , retiring child . The only out-of-the-way incident of his life was a two-year visit to Russia where one of his brothers was employed as an engineer . A friend wrote of him " IIe never knew prosperity or adversity , passion or satiety . Ile never had even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of eighty-two in boyish health . IIe knew no dejection , no heaviness of heart . IIe was a boy to the last . " Out of this temperamental serenity sprang the greatest happiness principle , the foundation stone of the Utilitarian philosophy . Of course , Bentham was not the first to identify good with happiness ; there have been systems of hedonism since the world began . The opening sentence of his Principles of Morals and Legislation : " Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters , pain and pleasure " derives directly from Part Two of Hume 's Treatise . But Bentham was a great populariser . IIe not only , enunciated his principle ; he worked it out . Ike gathered disciples . Bentham reckoned that if the greatest happiness principle were to be an effective guide to human action , we ought to be able to measure happiness , as we measure a table or a wall . IIe therefore set out seven dimensions of pleasure as follows : 1 . Intensity . 2 . Duration . 3 . Certainty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance it has of being followed by other pleasures ) . 6 . Purity ( or the chance it has of not being followed by pains ) . 7 . Extent ( that is , the number of people affected by it ) . Benthan allowed for differences in human constitution ; there would be different pleasures for different people ; but all would he measured by the same standards . Let us take a simple pleasure like " smelting a wallflower . " For Bentham this pleasure was very intense , because it reminded him of his grandmother 's garden at Barking . It would not rank high for duration ; but certainty and propinquity would be too ' - ' , , while the smelling went on . It would be fecund if it put Bentham into a good temper for the rest of the day . It would be pure enough ; but its extent would be limited , especially if it induced a mood of solitary contemplation instead of active good works . On the other hand , the pleasure of " hating your landlady , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint one ; its duration 300
