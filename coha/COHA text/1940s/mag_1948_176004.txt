Milhaud : Symphony No. 1 ( Columbia Broadcasting Symphony , Darius Milhaud conducting ; Columbia , 7 sides ) . France 's Composer Milhaud , like Brahms , waited until he was past 40 to write his first major symphony . He finally wrote it in 1939 , at 47 . The result is technically brilliant , bright and dry as enamel . Symphonies for Small Orchestra ( Concert Hall Society Chamber Orchestra , Darius Milhaud conducting ; Concert Hall Society , 4 sides ) . By comparison , these four little symphonies ( Nos. 1 , 2 , 3 and 5 ) seem like , and are , youthful practice flights . Performances : excellent . <P> Buxtehude : Organ Music ( Carl Weinrich , organist ; Musicraft , 8 sides ) . As a young man , Bach tramped 200 miles on foot to hear Dietrich Buxtehude play the organ . Some of the old master 's music , here superbly played by Princeton 's famed organist , shows some of the reasons why . Recording : good . <P> Brahms : A German Requiem ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the RCA Victor Chorale and Symphony , Robert Shaw conducting ; Victor , 18 sides ) . Brahms avoided the traditional liturgy , chose his own excerpts from the Bible " because I am a musician and because I needed them . " Finished eight years before his first symphony ( and foreshadowing it ) , this was the first composition to win him wide fame . Its moments of beauty more than make up for its minutes of tedium . Performance : good . <P> Richard Strauss : Ein Heldenleben ( Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra , Fritz Reiner conducting ; Columbia , 10 sides ) . A wag once tried to describe this fustian piece : " It is he , the Hero , and he has been drinking again . He is in E flat , and his cuffs are soiled by numerous dissonances . . . Four plain-clothes detectives come in on a sharp glissando , and , seizing the Hero , throw over his head a dark-tasting chord . . . " Performance : good . Suite from Der Rosenkavalier ( Philadelphia Orchestra , Eugene Ormandy conducting ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music Richard Strauss ever wrote , pleasingly played . Recordings : good . <P> Prokofiev : Summer Day Suite ( Santa Monica Symphony , Jacques Rachmilovich conducting ; Disc , 3 sides ) . Originally pieces for children , written for piano , this suite loses some of its charm in orchestration , even though it was the composer himself who orchestrated it . Performance : fair . <P> Ravel : Concerto for Piano and Orchestra ( Leonard Bernstein , pianist-conductor , with the Philharmonic Orchestra of London ; Victor , 5 sides ) . Ravel was feeling the hot breath of Gershwin on his neck when he wrote this one in 1932 ; Bernstein gives it dewy-eyed , loving treatment . Recording ( on Vinylite ) : excellent .
