txt It is five years today since a detachment of trespassing Japanese were fired upon by a Chinese bridge guard outside Peiping , thus furnishing the Japanese with what appeared to them to be a legitimate excuse for attempting the conquest of China . The Chinese can be proud of those five years . The Western democracies can not be so proud . Britain , moving to placate the Japanese in 1940 , closed their chief supply route , the Burma Road , for three months . The United States , with the same objective , for nearly four years permitted the export of petroleum products , scrap metals and other materials which were used by the Japanese against the Chinese . These now seem to have been melancholy mistakes . Yet if the Chinese find them hard to understand , even to forgive , they must realize that when a final choice had to be made we took their side and not that of the oppressor . We can not doubt that a temporary agreement between Japan and the United States might have been reached last November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China and lift the embargo on war materials . If we had been abject enough to accept such a reprieve Pearl Harbor might still be precariously intact , and the American Army Air Force might not be celebrating this anniversary by raiding Japanese bases in China . We are now full-fledged allies of the Chinese Republic , and will make no peace in the Orient until it has been purged of its invaders and disinfected . Whether we are yet doing our full duty to the Chinese , as individuals or as a nation , is less certain . As individuals we have not been generous in our gifts for China relief . As a nation we do not appear to have given more than token support so far . The Chinese put their war losses at 3,000,000 , and this is a low estimate if civilian deaths by war-produced disease and starvation are counted in . Property losses , computed according to Chinese living standards , have been staggering . No country in modern history has endured as much as China and still continued fighting . Our aid , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has been trivial by comparison . With the Burma Road again closed , this time not by the British but by the Japanese , it is not so easy as it was to get help to Chungking : Ways can nevertheless be found . Bombing planes , of which the Japanese display a lively fear , can be flown in . Freight planes can carry precious cargoes . New land routes are possible . Sympathy and admiration for the Chinese should urge us on . If we seek for a self-interested motive we may ask ourselves what would happen to the cause of the United Nations if China made peace , and the earth 's greatest reservoir of labor were placed at the disposal of the enemy . On any basis we owe infinitely more to the free Chinese than they can owe to us . Their terrible ordeal , so nobly borne , has earned them the right to full equality in the world society of nations . If the average American loves liberty as much as the average Chinese , and will fight , risk , work arid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the future .
