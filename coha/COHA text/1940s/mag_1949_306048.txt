As Argentina 's Minister of Education , Dr. Oscar Ivanissevich has a habit of dropping into classrooms around the country to deliver homespun lectures on the greatness of his boss , President Juan Pern . Last week , in a broadcast aimed at all the nation 's schools , Ivanissevich outdid himself . <P> " President Pern , " said Dr. Ivanissevich , " never leaves a faucet running more than is absolutely necessary . President Pern , when he leaves a room , puts out all the lights himself . In this way he saves money which would otherwise go abroad to pay for coal and oil . General Pern is also very careful about his clothes . You will never see a spot of dirt or cigarette ash on his suit , and that is not simply because his servants remove the stain . It is because he does not soil his clothes . When a suit gets dirty by accident , that is not so bad , but it is unpardonable to see the day 's menu on the lapel of one 's suit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the suit will last longer . <P> " Let us imitate General Pern , the Teacher No. 1 of the new Argentine School !
