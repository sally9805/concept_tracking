One outfit that was not surprised by the first shattering havoc wrought by German Stukas was the U. S. Navy . For Navy fliers had first conceived and developed the technique of launching a bomb from an airplane diving as close to the vertical as possible . But because U. S. citizens and their Congress believed in penny-pinching Army &; Navy upkeep in peacetime , most of the Navy 's dive-bombers today are obsolescent biplanes , descendants of the first Curtiss Helldiver . <P> Last week the Navy got a 1941 model Helldiver , a slick , fat-bodied monoplane that it designated XSB2C-I . Proudly announced by Curtiss-Wright Corp. , the new plane is another of the Navy 's new fighting craft sleekly built around a superpower , air-cooled engine-a 1,700-horse-power Wright Double-Row Cyclone . Curtiss-Wright announced that XSB2C-I is 100 miles an hour faster than any dive-bomber now in the air , which would put its top speed around 350 m.p.h . And it will carry twice the load of today 's best . Since the Stuka Junkers 87 carries a maximum bomb load of 1,100 Ib. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry better than a ton in its roomy belly . What also pleased Navy men was XSB2C-I 's range ( 600 miles farther to sea than any other model ) , and fire power ( double the punch of any single-engined Navy airplane now in service ) . Built for operation from carriers , Helldiver , 1941 is light and nifty on its feet . Curtiss-Wright said that it has a faster take-off than a pursuit plane , is unusually fast and maneuverable in flight .
