Jesse Stuart 's sister was " a beautiful , blue-eyed girl of 19 " when she took over the job of teaching the one-room school at a place he chooses to call Lonesome Valley , Ky . She came home shortly after that a nervous wreck . Among other things , one of her gangling first-graders , a teen-ager named Guy Hawkins , had blacked her eyes and " whipped her before the Lonesome Valley pupils . " <P> That was the main reason 16-year-old Jesse Stuart decided to be a schoolteacher . He asked for , and got , his sister 's old job . In time , he became county school superintendent , later quit to concentrate on farming and writing short stories and poetry ( Man with a Bull-Tongue Plow ) . This week , burly Jesse Stuart , now 42 , published a new book ( The Thread That Runs So True , Scribners ; $3 ) to tell what life as a Kentucky mountain teacher was like . <P> Backless Books . His first students numbered 35-girls in pigtails and fresh cotton dresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come with their dinner baskets in their hands and battered , backless books under their arms . Not one wore shoes . There were 19-year-olds in the first grade , 14-year-olds in the second , and a twelve-year-old girl in the eighth . <P> Among the 19-year-olds was Guy Hawkins , who had been in the first grade for eight years . One evening , when Teacher Stuart was working late at the school , Guy came back . " I aim to whip you , " he said . " It 's the same place where I whipped your sister . " The two men fought , but this time it was Guy who took the beating . <P> For Jesse , that was a triumph , but his troubles had just begun . When he let his boys . &; girls sit together , instead of keeping them on separate sides of the room , the bearded farmers of the valley grumbled that he was running " a courting school . " When he went to call on the lady teacher in the next town ( " pretty as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the men &; boys of her town ambushed him and bombarded him with rotten eggs . <P> Frozen Feet . In the summer , the sun beat down on the school 's tin roof , the pine boards sweated resin , and the smaller pupils dropped off to sleep . In winter " after the white frosts had fallen and blanketed the frozen land . . . many times I saw the red spots . . . from the bleeding little bare feet of those who came to school regardless of shoes . " Jesse had to cure pretty 14-year-old Vaida Conway of spitting tobacco juice on the schoolhouse walls , and furtive Alvin Purdy of scribbling obscenities in the privy . <P> Jesse found that if he cut up his big calendar and pasted the numbers on bits of cardboard , he could teach beginners to read and count while pretending to be playing a game . He taught them " how to measure a field and figure the number of acres , how to figure the number of bushels in a wagon bed or a corn bin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Chicken Creek and Unknown , too , began asking his pupils to measure their fields and count their bushels for them .
