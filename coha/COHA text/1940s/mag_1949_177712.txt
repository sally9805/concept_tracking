The President 's press conference was flagging , and a newsman asked half-heartedly whether he was going to have anything to say about the vacancy on the Supreme Court . He certainly was , said the President briskly . In fact , he would tell them about it right now . He had asked Attorney General Tom Clark to be the associate justice and Rhode Island 's Senator Howard McGrath , the Democratic National Chairman , to replace Clark at attorney general . Blurted a reporter : " My gosh ! " <P> Thomas Campbell Clark was not surprised : he had been ready and waiting for more than two years . He had , in fact , expected the appointment that Fred Vinson got , and when he lost out had stared long and silently out his office window . Then Harry Truman had soothed him , given him to understand that the next vacancy was his . Last week the President finally gave patient Tom Clark his reward , ignoring Washington politicos who assumed that Catholic Frank Murphy would be replaced with another Catholic .

He worked hard and late : " I have to work long hours because I 'm not as smart as some fellows . " <P> The Trust Buster . As Attorney General , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievement . He incurred a storm of criticism for his lackadaisical investigation of vote frauds in Kansas City 's 1946 Democratic " purge " primary . Labor-minded liberals regarded him suspiciously for demanding a strike injunction against John L. Lewis ; conservatives distrusted his opinion that the President has enough power to handle strikes without Taft-Hartley injunctions . <P> But Tom Clark prides himself on having instituted 160 antitrust actions ( since 1860 his predecessors averaged 42 cases each ) . He has been at pains to prove himself a champion of civil rights . He insisted that the Federal Bar Association admit Negroes , used to invite Negro messengers to lunch with him . <P> Despite a sullen mutter of disapproval from the nation 's press ( " A low ebb , " snorted the New York Herald Tribune ) , few voices of protest were raised in the Senate . Clark 's amiable " hya doin ' , sir ? " and his bow ties were well liked by the men on Capitol Hill , who appreciate a man whose ability is not oppressive and whose principles are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
