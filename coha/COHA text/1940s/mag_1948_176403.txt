The four newsmagazines* in the U.S. <P> are about to be joined by a fifth . Its <P> name : National Guardian . Its aim : to <P> bring " the facts " to " all who are sick of <P> confusion and artificially created fear . " <P> Said its staff-written manifesto this week : <P> " A hundred kinds of censorship have come <P> between the people and the facts . " An <P> " independent progressive " newsweekly , <P> National Guardian will begin publication <P> next month with a press run of 50,000 and <P> a masthead with a heavy list to port . <P> " We 're starting out very modestly on the shortest possible shoestring , " explained General Manager John T. McManus , former TIME and PM writer and leftish ex-president of the New York local of the American Newspaper Guild . He was mum on who supplied the shoestring . Top editors will be British-born Cedric Belfrage , onetime cinema critic for the London Daily Express , and James Aronson , New York newsman . Among the contributors : Author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Churchman ; Roger ( American Past ) Butterfield , Sportwriter John Lardner and his screenwriter brother Ring Jr . ( one of Hollywood 's " unfriendly ten " ) ; Max Werner , Anna Louise Strong , untiring apologist for Russia , and ex-New Masses Cartoonist William Gropper . <P> National Guardian 's prospectus was vague , but a tabloid preview edition printed last month ( as the National Gazette ) by Publisher J. W. Gitt of the York ( Pa . ) Gazette &; Daily gave the general idea . Smartly made up ( Gitt regularly wins typographical awards for his own paper ) , it gave six columns to Henry Wallace 's politicking , and brushed off the Battle of Berlin as something " fought mainly by the newspapers whose reports scared the daylights out of some Americans . " ( Gitt has since withdrawn as a sponsor . ) It looked as if the Guardian 's complexion would be somewhere between pink and rosy red . <P> <P> *TIME , Newsweek , U.S. News &; World Report , Pathfinder .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
