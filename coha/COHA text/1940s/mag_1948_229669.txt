For five hours , as Gandhi 's body was pulled through the streets of Delhi , Vallabhbhai Patel crouched on the funeral cart , his head bowed ; not once did he raise it . Alongside , barefoot in the dust , walked Jawaharlal Nehru . Said Nehru : " I have a sense of utter shame . " <P> The shame spread through the world with the news of Gandhi 's murder . The event brought the shock of recognition , rather than the shock of surprise . More forcibly than anyone in his age , Gandhi had asserted that love was the law ; how else should he die but through hatred ? He had feared machines in the hands of men not wise enough to use them , had warned against the glib , the new , the plausible ; how else should he die , but by a pistol in the hands of a young intellectual ? <P> The world knew that it had , in a sense too deep , too simple for the world to understand , connived at his death as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gandhi 's martyrdom and Lincoln 's was close and obvious . Each went down in the hollow between the crest of political victory and the crest of moral defeat . And Gandhi 's ashes were not cold before the world had begun to vulgarize his saintliness ( as it had vulgarized Lincoln's* ) by insisting , against the facts , that there was no vulgarity in him . The world finds it hard and self-shaming to believe that truth can be glimpsed from the earth ; its heroes must be projected into a nebulous world of " mysticism . " <P> In the little circumstances surrounding Gandhi 's death , in the sordid surroundings of his funeral , there were hints of the real Gandhi , the Gandhi who did not escape reality but pursued it in the teeth of all the windy words like " power " and " progress . " <P> The story of the death and funeral of Gandhi , however , is best read after a glance south from Delhi , to the place where stands a monument , the Taj Mahal , to another dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the memory of his empress ' beauty . It is man 's most eloquent effort to deny that the body and its beauty dies . It is a triumph of the mortician 's art . Some may try to raise a Taj to Gandhi ( the prettifiers will scarcely be able to stand statues of that ugly body ) . But Gandhi 's true monument will be his story-told again &; again . <P> " Let Me Go Now . " On the night before his death , Gandhi had recited a homely Gujarati couplet known in Porbandar ( where he was born in 1869 ) . It went : <P> This is a strange world , How long have I to play this game ? <P> His last hours were full of this sense of imminence . A few minutes before his assassin shot him down , Gandhi had looked at the tinny dollar watch that dangled from his loincloth . He had been talking with Sardar Patel , Deputy Prime Minister of India . " Let me go now , " said Gandhi . " It 's prayer time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
