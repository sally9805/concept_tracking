txt The Schwab mansion on Riverside Drive  --  one of the most magnificent private homes ever built in New York  --  has been sold and will make way for a modern apartment center . After having ' remained empty for more than eight years , the stately granite , chateau and the entire block in , which it stands have been acquired by the Prudential Insurance Company of America for a residential project which may accommodate as many as 600 families . The deal sealed the fate of the seventy-five-room house on which the late Charles M. Schwab , steel executive , lavished about $8,000,000 at the height of an era of gracious living . The big residence , which will pass soon into the hands of wreckers , long has outlived its usefulness . Since the deaths of Mr. and Mrs. Schwab early in 1939 it has stood idle , its bare halls echoing hollow memories of its past splendor . Taxes on the property have been eating up its value at the rate of about $60,000 a year . Price Exceeds $1,250,000 The assessed valuation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the , Prudential was reported to have been " in excess of $1,250,000 . " Two or three years ago the offering price was said to have been $2,300,000 to $2,500,000 . Although the amount of the housing investment planned ty the insurance company on this site was not announced , the contemplated size of the project indicated that the structural outlay alone would exceed $5,000,000 . The block has frontages of 208 feet on the Drive , 204 feet on West End Avenue , 393 feet on West Seventy-fourth Street and 352 feet on Seventy-third Street . Carrol M. Shanks , president of Prudential , said his - company had decided to buy the property because it was one of the few complete blocks available for development without displacing tenants . " We feel that there is a need and demand for additional housIling facilities of the Riverside Drive 1 type and we intend to start construction at the earliest practicable date , " Mr. Shanks said . " However , the present situation in the building field makes it impossible to say more definitely when ? that will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes that have taken place in the lading fashions and concepts of New York . This luxurious home , which served but one family , is giving way for comfortable accommodations for hundreds of families . " Sold by Chase Bank The purchase was made from the Chase National Bank , which took title at the time of settle ; ment of debts of the Schwab es ' tate . According to executives of the Prudential 's New York mortgageloan branch which handled the transaction , the buyers felt that the plot offered adequate space for buildings containing 2,000 to 2,500 rooms . The plan is to erect a group of modern buildings with apartments up to six or possibly seven rooms . Garage space will be provided , and a substantial part of the plot will be devoted to gardens . Mr. Schwab was said to have paid more than $800,000 for the land when he acquired it in 1901 . He and his wife spent much time in the next four years supervising construction of the home and furnishing it . They hired Maurice Ebert , architect , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French chateau of Chenonceaux , and the side facades after the castles of Blois and Azay-le-Rideau , which they had admired on visits to Europe . Building Cost $2,500,000 The house itself was reported to have cost more than $2,500,000 , and the owners spent even more than that on luxurious equipment , furnishings and works of art . Many of the forty baths have hand-painted walls . The marble swimming pool has ten handsome Carrara marble pillars . The enormous receptionhall , with its Corinthian motif , features fabulous wainscoting . There are kitchens capable of serving hundreds of persons at a time , a gymnasium , a $100 , - 000 power plant and heating system big enough for a great hotel , and a pipe organ which probably cost more than $50,000 . The organ was a part of the lavish facilities for social gatherings that often were held there . The organ can not be salvaged because its pipes are built into the walls of the residence . Most of the other equipment is outmoded and destined for the scrap-heap.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
