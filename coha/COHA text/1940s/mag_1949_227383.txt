Secret Servicemen clustered about a big mansion on Washington 's ornate Embassy Row one night last week like drones attending the queen bee . Inside , in the rococo , tapestry-hung ballroom of Anderson House , the President of the United States sat beaming before a heap of ten-cent-store toys and a big pink and gold cake topped by three candles . He puffed once and blew them out . The 70-odd guests-the Cabinet , some of the Supreme Court , the White House guard and their wives-applauded happily . House Speaker Sam Rayburn proposed a toast ( in domestic champagne ) to the future . <P> For four years Attorney General Tom Clark had given the party on Harry Truman 's birthday . This was the biggest one of all . Court Jester George Allen , deep in the Truman doghouse last summer for his pro-Eisenhower antics , was out again and sniffing the friendly presidential air for the first time in months . He sat pleased and smiling at Harry Truman 's own table . New York 's Mayor William O'Dwyer , another doghouse tenant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

After the last toast , the President strolled to the piano himself , rendered a competent Paderewski Minuet in G and a work of Chopin whose title escaped him . General George Marshall and Presidential Adviser John Steelman joined the three piano players for a friendly argument about music . " I 'm nuts about Chopin , " said the President . <P> At his 65th birthday party Harry Truman looked and acted like a man who had few qualms about the future . Congress was acting up again ( see The Congress ) and he still had four tough years ahead in the White House .
