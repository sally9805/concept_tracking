Joe DiMaggio 's friends were worried about him . For days in a row , he shut himself up in his midtown Manhattan hotel and brooded . He watched ballgames by television ; the semimonthly installments on his $90,000-a-year salary seemed to increase his gloom . Waiting for his sore heel to heal had made easygoing , hard-playing Joe DiMaggio a different man . <P> Last week , to the delight of Joe DiMaggio and of U.S. baseball in general , the doctors gave him the green light ; Joe was ready to take his turn at bat again . Outfielder DiMaggio , down to a lithe , trim 195 , put on his uniform and went to the bench with the team . Exuberantly , he wrestled with Teammate Charlie Keller , clowned with Phil Rizzuto , scuffled with other teammates . Nobody had ever seen reserved , 34-year-old Joe act so coltish . <P> As he trotted onto the field at Boston 's Fenway Park for the first of a three-game series with the Red Sox , DiMaggio was far from mid-season physical condition , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to feel nine feet tall . In his first time at bat , he lashed out a sharp single . The next time , he slammed a home run , drove in the runs that won the game . Red Sox fans came to their feet and gave him one of the loudest and longest ovations ever heard in Fenway Park . Joe was back all right-and he was n't through proving it . <P> Next day , with the Yanks trailing 7-1 , he hit another homer with two men on , to put his team back in the game . Three innings later he homered again , to win it . After the game , Joe Dugan , an old Yankee third baseman who used to play with Ruth and Gehrig , rushed into the pandemonium in the Yankee dressing room and planted a kiss on DiMaggio 's forehead . " Just had to do it , " Dugan explained , " I 've never seen anybody who could surpass this guy . " On the third day , Joe whomped homer No. 4 to confound the Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of superlatives , all the great DiMaggio could do was grin .
