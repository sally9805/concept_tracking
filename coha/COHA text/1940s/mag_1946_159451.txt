In Bombay last week " Butler 's Buttercups " struggled desperately with the ghost of Subhas Chandra Bose . On the birthday of the onetime Congress party leader who had gone off to lead a Jap-sponsored Indian army and die in a Jap plane crash , thousands of Hindus jammed downtown streets shouting Bose 's battle cry , Jai Hind , ( Victory to India ) . <P> At Round Temple , dividing point between Hindu and Moslem sections of the city , tough , stocky Commissioner Harold Edwin Butler 's Buttercups ( blue-and-yelow uniformed police ) tried to bar the way . When paraders squatted on the pavements , the law hurled tear gas . Up came the Hindus with flailing bamboo lathis ( traditionally a police weapon against demonstrators ) . Police lines broke under their charge , scattered Buttercups were beaten . Pop bottles and stones came flying from housetops together with buckets of water . Barricades of flaming trees were thrown across streets . False alarms called firemen to remote sections where gangs of goondas ( hooligans ) attacked them . <P> Casualties reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on through three days , and subsided inexplicably just when police expected it to grow fiercest-on the 17th anniversary of the Congress party 's demand for independence . <P> The riots were symptoms of India 's deep unrest which Bose had come to symbolize . As the new Central Legislative Assembly met for the first time in New Delhi , not only Bose 's brother , Sarat Chandra Bose , but Moslem League Leader Mohamed Ali Jinnah , champion of Pakistan and once a good friend of Britain , denounced British use of Indian troops in Java , demanded their removal . <P> Through India rumors were spreading that Bose had not really died but was alive and working underground . The Buttercups almost wished that it were true . Bose alive was not nearly so tough to handle as Bose dead .
