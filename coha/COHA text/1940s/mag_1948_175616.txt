Anthropology studies Man in all his aspects , including his customs and cultures . Physical anthropology , which gives Man a much narrower look , measures his ( and her ) physical characteristics . The American Association of Physical Anthropologists recently met in Washington to swap some new measurements . <P> A favorite study at present seems to be the blood ( it used to be the skull ) . Dr. Victor E. Levine of Creighton University , Omaha , used blood tests to determine where Eskimos came from . In blood groups , he said , Eskimos are practically identical with American Indians . Therefore they are not descendants of Europe 's ice-age population ( as one theory maintains ) , or recent immigrants from Siberia . They are probably Indians who moved north and developed their peculiar culture . This theory , said Dr. Levine , is supported by the fact that ancient Eskimo-like relics have been reported as far south as Manhattan Island . <P> Blood &; Baldness . Blood was also on the mind of Anthropologist C. Wesley Dupertuis of Presbyterian Hospital , New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical students ( by injecting dye into their veins ) and compared it with their general body-build . The plump , rounded subjects ( endomorphs ) and the slender , delicate ones ( ectomorphs ) had less blood compared to weight than the mesomorphs , or husky , athletic types . Conclusion : if you have lots of muscle , you probably have lots of blood . <P> Dr. R.E.G. Armattoe , of Londonderry , Northern Ireland , whose paper was read to the meeting , is a student of human hairiness , which varies , he said , with geography and intellect . For some undetermined reason , the most intellectual men are apt to be the baldest . Dr. Armattoe attended the 1947 meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science at Dundee , Scotland , and found that 55% of the male delegates showed " central baldness " and 22% " frontal baldness . " Swedish intellectuals were found to be in the most desperate shape : 70% of them are bald before they are 40 . In Switzerland the incidence of intellectual baldness is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair problems too , but of a different sort . At the Dundee convention , said Dr. Armattoe , 58% of the female scientists between 21 and 45 showed " hirsutism in the form of mustaches . " Swedish women are luckier than others . Most of them are as bald on their upper lips as the male Swedes are on their pates . But on the whole , Dr. Armattoe concluded sadly , mustaches are an increasing problem to the cultured young women of Europe . <P> Mansfield Lonie , of the National Bureau of Standards , is involved in commercial anthropometry . His job , he said , is to set up scientific size standards for the clothing industry . So far , he has had poor cooperation . Clothiers , particularly women 's dress manufacturers , refuse to face anthropometric facts . They persist in designing garments on " model forms " which have little resemblance to real female bodies . They assume that women will change their shapes with the shifting moods of fashion . It makes life pretty difficult , Mr. Lonie hinted , for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
