Generalissimo Francisco Franco struck a blow last week for Germany . By word and action , as surely as if he had ordered his troops to fire , he compelled the Allies to divert men , equipment and energy from Tunisia ( see col. 3 ) and spend them upon preparations which might have been deferred if Spain were safely neutral . <P> Franco 's words , spoken to the newly reshuffled Falange National Council , told the world precisely where Franco stands and what Franco believes . Said he : <P> " The liberal world is going down , a victim to its own errors . . . . Mussolini united ... a social urge and a national idea . Later Germany found a new solution ... in National Socialism . . . . The historic destiny of our era will be settled either according to the barbarous formula of Bolshevist totalitarianism , or according to the spiritual , patriotic formula Spain offers us , or according to any other formula of the Fascist nations . " <P> Franco 's actions told the world what his words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his northern borders , where the Germans might enter Spain , but in the south , where Gibraltar and the Allies in North Africa may be attacked from the rear . <P> In Spanish Morocco , at General Dwight Eisenhower 's rear , Franco has increased his garrisons from about 135,000 to 180,000 men . Ill-equipped and poor though Spain is , some of the forces in Spanish Morocco are partially mechanized . Many are Moors , who are among the world 's best soldiers . <P> Franco 's threat bore the Axis stamp and perhaps foreshadowed Axis strategy . Whether Washington 's recent diplomacy - kind words to Franco from President Roosevelt , loans , trade pacts-had come utterly to naught remained to be seen . U.S. relations with Franco were as cloudy , and perhaps as expedient , as those with Admiral Darlan . But U.S. and British military men took no chances . <P> Against an Axis attempt to take Gibraltar , seal the western Mediterranean and thus neutralize many of the benefits of the North African invasion , the Allies could do very little in advance . Gibraltar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the cost of resources sorely needed in Tunisia , they had to prepare to offset the loss of Gibraltar . <P> Answer to Franco . Engineers labored to perfect airdromes and dock facilities at Casablanca and Dakar , to provide alternate points of entry for planes , men and equipment in case Gibraltar falls and the Mediterranean ports of Algeria are immobilized . Gibraltar is now the principal way station for bombers flown from Britain to North Africa , and perhaps for long-range U.S. fighters . Casablanca ( 1,200 miles from southern Britain ) can serve as a substitute , and as a depot for planes flown from the U.S. via Natal and Dakar ; men and equipment can be hauled by rail from Casablanca to upper Morocco , Algeria and Tunisia . The counter-preparations were well along . Allied strategists hoped that the Axis had missed the boat to Gibraltar . <P> For the Long Term . The Allies in North Africa had offered Hitler a second front ( TIME , Nov. 16 ) and Hitler had accepted the offer . German reinforcements in Tunisia and even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the German plan for a counteroffensive . So did Franco 's belligerent words &; deeds .
