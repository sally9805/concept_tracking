The idea that " night blindness " is caused only by lack of vitamin A , and can be cured by eating carrots , is stylish but false according to a group of scientists in Edinburgh . They declare that most night blindness among soldiers is psychological . <P> In the last two issues of the British Medical Journal , Dr. Erich Wittkower , Psychologist Thomas Ferguson Rodger and collaborators have set down the results of their investigations of this wartime ailment . <P> Dr. Wittkower and Major Rodger picked at random 52 soldiers who were helpless in the dark ; some of them had proved it by wrecking cars .

Sample case : <P> A puny soldier of 25 , whose father had been a " strong man " and wrestled with a Russian bear and whose mother had pampered him . He fought in France , did bravely in Norway until he was blown into a cellar ; then he developed night blindness . His ambition : to descend in a parachute in the center of Berlin and wreck buildings . If Britain should be invaded , he plans to kill his whole family , including his stepfather , " to prevent them from being raped .
