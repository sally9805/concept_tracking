The famed Norden bombsight , perhaps the most closely guarded U.S. military secret of the war , last week had its first public showing . Anybody with 30 could have a look through it at Manhattan 's Museum of Science and Industry ( see cut ) , anybody at all could see it free behind a rope at a Wall Street War Bond show . But not even a spying engineer could learn much from this glimpse . The instrument , which contains some 2,000 parts and costs nearly $10,000 , is so complex that , although a number of the sights have fallen into enemy hands , its inventors are confident that enemy technicians can not duplicate it in time for World War II . <P> The two chief components of the sight were revealed to be a stabilizer and the sighting mechanism , together weighing 90 lbs . The bombardier makes only three adjustments by hand : one for the weight of the bombs ( which can be done before the flight ) , the others for altitude and sighting on the target . The bombardier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight turn the plane in the right direction by means of an automatic pilot . Everything else-the bombing plane 's speed , altitude , wind drift , etc. is registered automatically . The bombsight even releases the bombs , at the right , split-second moment . <P> This week the sight 's inventor , Java-born Carl L. Norden , was to be awarded the Holley Medal of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers for his invention . Meantime , the Navy announced that Inventor Norden had a collaborator , Captain Frederick I. Entwistle , assistant research chief of the Navy 's Bureau of Ordnance . Captain Entwistle , who joined Norden in his experiments in 1928 , shares the patents and the credit for the final model .
