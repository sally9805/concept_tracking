Janie ( by Josephine Bentham &; Herschel Williams ; produced by Brock Pemberton ) tells of a new Junior Miss up to new junior mischief . It tells it in terms of the present , when small towns lie chockablock with army camps , and harum-scarum , boy-crazy young things , talking weird slang in whiny voices , give high-school seniors the go-by and dashing privates the come-on . One night , while her parents are out , Janie ( Gwen Anderson ) throws a small party for the military , which by midnight achieves riotous and regimental proportions . Coca-Cola gives way to Scotch , soldiers get locked in bathrooms , jeeps get stalled on the lawn , neighbors scream for the police , and the family unseasonably returns . By 2 a.m. , however , everything 's shipshape and everyone 's asleep . <P> Janie ought to be more fun than it is . It has some amusing lines , some lively moments . It brings a timely touch of khaki to the timeless absurdities of youth . But it is n't buoyant or spontaneous enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan . It has that terrible noisiness which is the bane of too-innocent merriment . Refreshing is the still , small voice of Janie 's baby sister Elsbeth ( Clare Foley ) , who at seven is a past mistress of espionage and blackmail . Elsbeth is funny . The rest is formula .
