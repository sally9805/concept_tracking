txt Washington ca n't make up its mind on how to solve the manpower muddle . During 1943 the country needs 6 5 more people ( mostly men I to serve armed forces , to work in war plants , toil in the farm fields . Two steps were taken in the past two weeks to make these people available . The 48-hour week was put into effect in 32 laborshortage areas and dependency was removed as grounds for draft deferment of non-essential workers . Now Washington officials doubt that these moves are the answer . They think a manpower crisis still is just around the corner Those charged with solving the manpower dilemma are looking more and more to the Idea of national service legislation  --  a labor draft But they hesitate to back it for fear the " people back home " wo n't like it . They know labor as opposed to it and management sees serious problems in it If there is n't a labor draft . the manpower experts say , the country fares one of two alternatives : ( 1 ) on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 widespread confusion coupled with the risk that aims production will be set back . as the country tries to raise the 6 5 million on a patchwoi k basis . The manpower problem is many-sided . It reaches into every corner of military planning and production for war and the civilian economy It laps over into politics Congress and the Administration are far ft ( m seeing eyeto-eye on either basic policy or methods . Military Tops the List The armed services top the list of additional demands on manpower this year . They plan to take 4.4 million men to lift their strength Co 11 million men by the year-end . Next comes war plants . Their additional requirements are placed at 1 S million . In addition . s-me 300.000 additional farm workers , probably more , must be found to meet production goals . , President Roosevelt at his press con. ference yesterday discussed the size of the Army which would be built tip by the end of this year . Story on Page 4 1 It was to make those 65 million available that President Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ el kweek of 45 hours and Manpower Commissioner Paul V. issued an order that dependency no longer would be regarded as draft deferment grounds for men in 65 occupations . But a start already has been made in Congress to undo part of what the Administration has clone to strengthen the manpower structure . The House Military Affairs Committee on Thursday approved the Kilday bill which restores dependency RS a draft consideration . Meantime , membsis of the Congressional farm bloc are plugging legislation that would cause drafted farmers to be relea-cd from the Army if that is necessary to provide manpower for the farms . National service legislation . backed by Reiriabliean members , has been of/coed in both the House and Senate . Thus far , its status IS inactive but sponsors believe serious consideration of it 1S only a matter of a few months away . It provides the machinery , by law , to supply the manpower needed in war plants and essential civilian industry at the same time the armed services ate filling their needs . Pinch Beginning Now Thus far , war production has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken into the Army , Navy , : Marine Corps and Coast Guard The pinch is beginning now and it will become progressively tighter throughout this year . That is why talk grows in Congress of limiting the size of the armed force to something less than 11 million men In a few months , drafting of married men with childi en will become general unless the projected size of the Army is reduced . The deferment which enactment of the Kilday bill would grant would not last long if the goal of 4 4 million more men is to he achieved If every boy reaching the age of 18 this year were able-bodied and had no claim for deferment on occupational or educational grounds . 1 2 million of the 4 4 million goal could be secured from this youth source . The Call for Alarmed Even assuming perfection were reached , there would still be required the induction of 3 2 million others  --  obviously , married men with or without children . But 25r , . of the 18-19 year olds who became eligible for the draft last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , it is safer to assume that instead of getting 1,2 million youths , only 0 8 million will be inducted . Therefore , 3 6 million married men appear to be headed for military service this year . One official estimate puts the number of married men with wives at only 4 million . Deducting 40 , , ; for physical rejections , that total is pared down to 2 4 million Further subtractions must he made for men who are in necessary industry and the ones who will i emain on farms so that the net available for army induction is likely to be somewhere between 1 and 1.5 million . By adding the number of draftable 18 year olds and men with wives only , a total of 2.2 to 2.7 million is obtained . As a result , the number of men with families destined for military service is between 1 7 and 2.2 million menthe largest group of all One factor which may throw this set of figures out of balance is the 1 million single men still holding draft deferments because they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian jobs ; or 13 ) employed in agriculture . Should they lose their deferment status , 1 million married men would get reprieves from m.litary service , But the chances are against that eventuality under present draft policy It II be possible . though , to recover quite a few of the men from war plants because of the replacement schedules which have been put into effect there The replacement program . in theory at least . should make it possible for 570 - 000 men in war job . Whit is the possibility that loose holding essential agriculture jobs or essential civilian jobs will be uprooted ? It is a good bet none of those deferred for faint work will be ( hafted under any circumstances It is questionable whether an men holding key jobs in the 35 essential actr  --  ities will be snatched up by the Army . as some semblance of a civilian economy has to be maintained Of course , the prospects Will change overnight if Congress decides to go ahead and give dependency full pilot-ay as a draft deferment . The Kilda Bill If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathers being drafted immediately . regardless of their occupation . will be heavy Also the belt would mean that fewer lathe 's will be drafted in the long run since some of the single men who have thus far escaped the draft on occupational grounds will be inducted as soon as present deferments run out Even if Congress can be persuaded to keep Its hands off the manpower problem , it is not a certainty that the draft will proceed in line with the W Itt C policy . The upsetting factor is the autonomy of the local draft boards In the final analysis , each board serves as judge and jury for each man 's case . A board can disregard the " instructions " sent out by national headquarters ? in fact , reports indicate that a number of them do . If a board decides a man merits deferment because induction would work a hardship on him and his family , it can Insulate him from the draft so long as it is able to meet the draft calls with other men in its jurisdiction .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
