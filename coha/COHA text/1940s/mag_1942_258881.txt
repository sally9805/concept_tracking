Irrepressible American humor bubbled up out of the Jap-infested bamboo jungles of Bataan Peninsula last week . It had broad sweeps of satire , muted undertones of tragedy . <P> Plane-hungry U.S. and Filipino troops under General Douglas MacArthur adopted a slogan : " Better buy one bomber than be buried on Bataan . " They agreed to contribute as much as a month 's pay per man to a " Bomber for Bataan " fund . <P> When news came through of the Japanese submarine attack near Santa Barbara , the grapevine telegraph slyly tapped out a suggestion : " General MacArthur should send a message to the commanding general of the Ninth Corps Area which includes " air-raided " Los Angeles- see p. 14 saying : ' If you can hold out for 30 days , will send help . ' " <P> There were so many false reports of U.S. reinforcements arriving that Bataan 's defenders swapped one cup of coffee for one fresh rumor . Fruits and vegetables were so infrequently on the menu that the No. 1 bull-session topic ( lovely women back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men would order once the Jap was driven out of the Philippines . <P> As thick as the rumors , as commonplace to the men as their daily rations , were the heroes among them and the stories of their exploits : <P> &gt; It seemed certain that Lieut . Roland G. Sauinier would get a medal soon , or that the infuriated Jap would sacrifice scores of men to kill him . Bullets so far have nicked Sauinier " on the bottom of an elbow " and have " clipped holes " in his pants . Undismayed , the Lieutenant breaks the daily monotony by shouting across foxholes and trenches , in his broad French-Canadian accent : <P> " Hey , you damned Japanese , come on over here . " Invariably a frustrated , fuzzy - tongued voice answers : " - you , Fuwren-chee . " <P> &gt; In the hospital is tall , boyish Edward Archie Mclntosh , who cleaned out a Jap machine-gun nest after his own scouting party had been wiped out and he himself had been horribly wounded in the right leg . Although he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry now is whether " my girl will like a fellow with only one leg . " <P> &gt; Most colorful of the Bataan defenders is the all-American 31st Infantry , under leathery Colonel Charles L. Steel . Of all Colonel Steel 's " Foreign Legion characters , " the men reserved a top place for 2nd Lieutenant John Flynn , recently commissioned after 33 years of Army service . A sad-eyed Mr. Chips , Flynn delights his men by mixing tobacco juice and contempt for Jap marksmanship on scouting trips into the brush . <P> &gt; Other particularly able scouts are American Indians in the 31st . One is Corporal Peter Flame , a 200-pound Yuma , Ariz , former football player and champion boxer , who bashfully hangs his head when reporting another sniper potted . Another is tall , lean Joe Longknife from a Montana reservation . On a recent raid he rose up out of tall grass , killed ten Japs with 16 shots , dispersed the rest with hand grenades . When he was a youngster Joe listened to tales of raiding parties told him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Old Longknife.
