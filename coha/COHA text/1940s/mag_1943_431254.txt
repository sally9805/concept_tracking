 | What 's Holding Up the Air Offensive against Germany ? Condensed from the author 's forthcoming book , , /h " Germany Can Be Bombed to Defeat " Allan A. Michie THE ABILITY of Germany to make war depends almost entirely on the production of 50 industrial centers . All of them are within easy range of four-motored bombers from English bases . Their destruction , city by city , is simply a problem of sending over enough planes of the right type able to haul the necessary weight of explosives . We know pretty accurately what is needed to do the job . Every German bomb dropped on Britain has been located and charted and its effect studied . Taking the average of Britain 's experience , one 2000-pound bomb can destroy or severely damage as many buildings as are found in more than two typical American city blocks . The bombs dropped in one r000-plane raid would virtually paralyze for months any of the 50 key industrial cities of Germany . Thus , assuming 12 good bombing nights a month ( a conservative estimate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 50 cities essential to the functioning of the German war machine could he crippled within a period of four months . To keep a force of 1000 planes operating three nights each week would require a total of 3000 planes . Assuming that losses remained at the five percent rate of the Cologne , Bremen , Essen-Ruhr 1000-plane raids , we should have to be prepared to replace some 600 planes each month . An additional 4o0 planes might temporarily be put out of action due to anti-aircraft damage , take-off and landing crack-ups and field accidents . So we would have to replace or repair r000 planes monthly . This can be done by the combined American and British production . The United States alone is scheduled to reach a production of 1000 heavy bombers a month in 1943 ? . Eight hundred of  | these could be flown to Britain every month , leaving an adequate number for necessary replacements in the South Pacific , the Middle East and North Africa . The British should be able to produce 2oo four-engined machines each month . If Germany can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of l000-plane raids , we are entitled to ask why such raids have not been carried out . So far , the RAF has been able to stage only three such raids ? the latest in June 1942 . The truth is that the British Bomber Command alone does not have the bomber strength necessary to keep up loon-plane raids . And , up to now , the assistance of the U. S. Air Force bombers in Britain , upon which so many hopes were placed , has been slow to materialize . The RAF 's Bomber Command , the only force that carried the war home to the German people in 1942 , has only ten percent of the operational planes in Britain 's Air Force at its disposal for bombing Germany . In three years of war , the RAF as a whole has expanded enormously . The fighter strength is four times what it was at the end of the Battle of Britain in 194o . Coastal Command alone now equals the entire prewar strength of the RAF . But this has been achieved in part at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has fewer planes and fewer squadrons than it had one year ago . There are various reasons for this . British bomber production was slowed down in 1941 ? 42 during the change-over from two-motored types to four-motored . Two of the four-motored types , the Starlings and Halifaxes , had faults that showed up in operation , and production had to be further slowed down while they were rectified . The Lancaster , by far the best bomber for bombing Germany , is still being improved with greater speed and higher ceiling , and its production still is far short of what the British would like it to be . In addition , Britain 's aircraft factories are seriously short of manpower . Bombers of course had to be sent to Africa and to India , further whittling down home-based strength . But by far the greatest single reason for the shortage of , bombers to raid Germany is the fact that more than half of Britain 's total bomber force is under the direction of the Admiralty . It is on U-boat patrol or engaged in bombing naval targets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by borrowing Admiralty planes . There is no doubt that the air patrol of 6,500,00o square miles of sea from the Arctic Circle to the Equator , from Norway to the midAtlantic , has played a major role in the winning of the Battle of the Atlantic . But that 's doing the job the hard way . It takes an average of 7000 hours of oversea air patrol to spot one U-boat and many thousands of hours more to sink one . Bomber Command believes that  | it is much more profitable to smash the U-boats before they can take to the sea ? in their slipways and docks at Danzig , Flensburg and L'Orient , in the repair yards at Gdynia and Bremen , and in the factories . One night raid by loo planes can wipe out in an hour more U-boats than all the sea patrol planes can spot in three months . In a single raid on Emden , Bomber Command reduced to dust and rubble the great Nordseewerke , the largest U-boat-building center in the world . The two-motored machines the Admiralty uses are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not afford to wait for the best . Even these comparatively obsolescent planes can safely be used at the tail end of a loon-plane raid ( and were used on the Cologne , Bremen and Essen-Ruhr raids ) , coming in over the target after the heavy bombers have " saturated " the ground defenses . The leaders of the RAF hoped to be able to stage two or three mooplane raids weekly on Germany throughout the fall of 1942 . This hope was based on the belief that American bombers would participate . The opening raids of American bombers against targets in Occupied France and Holland got a lot of ballyhoo , but during the first year of American participation in the war not a single U. S. Air Force plane dropped a bomb on Germany . And 1 he war in the air will be won only by the bombing of Germany . Theoretically , Germany can be bombed either by day or night . The British regard the bombing of Germany city by city as a trucking job . British bombers are designed to get off the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reich , drop it and get home again . And the British have learned that this trucking job costs fewer planes and crews when done at night . When the war began , both the British and German aerial high commands believed that it was possible to stage mass air attacks during daylight hours . Both learned better , by costly experience . But when U. S. bomber units arrived in Britain in the summer of 1942 it was with the announced intention of carrying out sustained daylight attacks on Germany . Up to now they have made experimental short-range raids ( most of them with as many as 2o fighters escorting each bomber ) on targets in Occupied Europe ? but they have not once pushed their attack into Germany . They may , before this appears in print , risk sorties into German territory , but any such sporadic raids will have a vastly larger effect in American headlines than they will on the German war machine . The daylight bombardment of Germany can only be effective if it is carried out day after day without stop . Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only be carried out with fighter escort . About 8o miles is as far out as  | fighter planes are effective protection ? far enough to escort bombers to Lille , 55 miles inside the French coastline , but far short of vital German targets . Both sides have developed long-range fighters but as yet these are no match for the faster and more maneuverable short-range fighters . The real purpose of these longrange machines is to intercept enemy bombers when they get beyond the protection of their own fighters . To take an example from our own planes , the Lockheed Lightning ( the P38F ) was primarily designed to intercept enemy bombers approaching America 's long coast lines and is no match in dogfights over Germany with the faster , more maneuverable FW-19o 's and Me-ro9G 's . There are five methods of selfdefense which bombers can use over enemy territory . Two are offered by nature ? darkness and clouds ; three are artificial ? speed , height and armament . British bombers have been designed to take advantage of the natural defenses . American bombers depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monster bombers . Their Lancaster , the best of them , surpasses our Fortresses and Liberators in speed and range . On short flights the Lancaster can carry s8,0oo pounds of bombs ? approximately three times the capacity of our Liberators . The British Stirling and Halifax fall not far short of this performance . Our Boeing Fortresses and Consolidated Liberators were designed primarily for American needs in the Pacifrc and Caribbean . They were built to fly long distances at good speed , and because of the extra allowances for fuel the earlier models carried little armament or armor , and what seems now a small bomb load . Both the armament and armor have since been improved . The bomb load remains small by British shorthaul standards . Operating only in daylight , the Fortresses and Liberators depend for their success on the tremendously accurate secret Norden bombsight , which virtually guarantees " precision " bombing from great heights . This sight is perhaps ten times more accurate than the one generally used by the British , and there is probably every justification for the boasts of American bombardiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 20 , - 0oo feet . " However , in order to hit a barrel from 2o , ooo feet you must first see the barrel . In the Pacific , the Middle East and North Africa , where cloudless skies are the rule , this is not difficult . But in Europe , where there are likely to be several layers of clouds between the ground and 20 , o00 feet ( especially from November through March ) , " precision " bombing is absolutely impossible except on occasional hours of widely scattered days . I have heard British meteorologists claim that on not more than 12 days per year can you expect perfect weather conditions for " precision " bombing ? that is , clear weather at the base airdromes , and  | no clouds , mist or industrial haze from a height of 2o,00o feet above the target down to the ground . Our Fortresses and Liberators used to be able to fly higher than either enemy planes or enemy anti-aircraft guns could reach . That is no longer true . The new German planes and guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 1o , ooo feet above our Fortresses ' best operating ceiling . Speeds of fighter planes now are far above those of our bombers . Our big bombers now pack more and heavier guns than any other bombers in the world ? .50-caliber machine guns which outrange the Jap .25 caliber and the German .30 's . But most German fighters have cannon as well as machine guns and can throw more pounds of projectiles per minute than even our Fortresses . On their short-range , escorted flights over Occupied Europe , the cross fire of Fortresses and Liberators flying in close formation has been very successful in keeping the German fighters at a distance . Part of their success , as the American bomber crews would be the first to admit , has been due to their very strong fighter escort . However , on a long-range flight beyond the protection of fighters , German fighters would be able to keep up incessant attacks , forcing the Fortresses and Liberators to use up all their ammunition , after which the bombers would be at the Nazi fighters ' mercy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daylight operations over the Pacific , for which they were specifically designed ; and also in China , India , the Middle East , North Africa and Italy . But operations against the comparatively weak fighter and anti-aircraft defenses in these areas and against the stronglydefended German homeland are two different things . Despite the fact that our vaunted heavy bombers have not been able as yet to bomb Germany effectively , we are being told that they are superlative battleships of the air . Forrest Davis , in an article in The Saturday Evening Post of November 14 , 1942 , set out to prove that " the muchcriticized Flying Fortresses have answered their critics by licking the Luftwaffe 20 to 1 ? and perhaps changed the course of the war . " They have done neither . The contentions of apologists for the Fortresses and Liberators are based on the communiques of the U. S. Air Force in Britain after each attack by Fortresses and Liberators on Occupied France and Holland . I do not suggest that these communiques have been deliberately overoptimistic . They merely report the claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raids . But such claims must be coldly scrutinized . Because of the tremendous speed at which air combat takes place , airmen frequently overstate the damage they have been able to inflict on enemy planes . To counter this , the RAF imposed early in the war a ruling that no plane could be claimed as  | " destroyed " unless the pilot saw it crash , or its crash could be confirmed by an observer on the ground . So far , the U. S. Air Force in Britain has not imposed such a standard . If a gunner claims a plane as shot down , it is so listed in our communiques . And with half a dozen gunners in each plane , and at least 12 planes flying in formation , with most of the gunners firing , confusion and duplication in claims are inevitable . Our airmen are just getting combat experience . They are seeing enemy planes for the first time , while their opponents are the best pilots of the Luftwaffe , crafty survivors of three years of air fighting . These Luftwaffe pilots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combat . When the FW-19o 's attack they sometimes come up in a long , sweeping climb , get in a burst of gunfire and , in order to get out of reach before the Fortresses ' guns can concentrate on them , flip over on their backs and plummet toward the ground . As they turn over they close the throttle , causing a stream of black smoke to pour from their exhausts . Once near the ground they pull out and climb for another attack , but the gunners in the Fortresses and Liberators , who have no time to watch for the crash of enemy planes , claim them as " destroyed " on the strength of smoking motors . Thus , on October 9 , 1942 , 11o Fortresses and Liberators claimed to have driven a total of 102 Lzftwafe fighter planes from the sky over northern France . The bombers were escorted by 46o Spitfires and Hurricanes . These fighters claimed a total of five enemy planes destroyed . The bombers claimed 56 German fighters " destroyed , " 26 " probably destroyed , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful consideration of these claims , refused to issue a joint communique with the U. S. Air Force that day ( which it had always done when American and British planes took part in an operation ) , a fact that was apparently missed in America . By RAF standards ? that is , visual proof of a crashed plane ? the total claim on this raid should have been five enemy machines shot down by the fighter escort , 12 by the 110 bombers . Veteran RAF pilots who were along on the raid told me afterward that the Americans actually claimed to have shot down more enemy fighters than were in the air ? a fact which the Germans lost no time in announcing . There is nothing wrong with the technical qualities of America 's four-motored bombers . Structurally , they have proved excellent machines and there is no doubt that they can absorb plenty of punishment . Nor is there any indication that relations between the RAF and the U. S. Air Force in Britain are not excellent . The high commanders are close personal friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crews there is nothing but complete cordiality and the friendliest rivalry .  | The difference of opinion is simply that the British feel , with justification , that America 's contribution to the bombing of Germany is being unnecessarily restricted because of our reluctance to abandon a tactical concept ? mass bombing by daylight ? which is not yet possible in the European theater . To put it another way , America at the moment is trying to use equipment in a war theater for which it was never intended under conditions which , the British believe , will lead only to disaster . In order to bomb Germany continuously we need flexibility in our bombing policy instead of rigid adherence to one tactical idea ? the idea of high-level precision bombing ( luring daytime . The Germans began with the same fixed idea ? and their lack of adaptability may have cost them the war . They refused to abandon mass daylight attacks on Britain until they had lost so many bombers that they were unable to stage heavy enough night attacks to bring Britain to her knees . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a versatile bomber force . Britain 's new plywood , twin-motored De Haviland Mosquito , which carries one ton of bombs and no armament , can carry out daylight raids on Germany even in the best of weather because of its speed of over 4o0 m.p.h . The Lancasters , despite their tremendous weight-lifting abilities , are still fast enough to carry out daylight raids on Germany , using " cloud hopping " tactics to sneak to the target , or utilizing low-level attacks at almost zero feet to surprise the ground defenses . The British have never abandoned daylight raiding under favorable conditions . During August-September-October 1942 , British bombers carried out 45 daylight attacks on some 3o German cities ? including four on Cologne , four on Essen , four on Wilhelmshaven , four on Frankfurt and four on Emden . If we abandon mass daylight raiding as our only bombing policy there is no technical reason why our Fortresses and Liberators could not carry out similar raids under the same conditions . Once we gain air mastery over Germany , by destroying German fighter-plane factories , decimating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? British , Russian , as well as American ? can be turned to daylight attacks , with all the precision they give . But in order to achieve that , the main weight of Anglo-American attacks must at first be at night over Germany . If America had the time , we should be wise to design a night bomber specifically for European operations . We do not have the time , however , and the issue resolves to this : whether we want to win the war quickly with the air weapons now available , or whether we want to risk winning it years later with more advanced weapons .  | If our Fortresses and Liberators are unable to bomb Germany consistently by day , they can be adapted to bomb Germany by night . And they must be so adapted if we are to achieve the short cut to victory that is within our grasp . Three things alone are holding up American participation in the night assault against Germany . I. Our Fortresses and Liberators are not as yet equipped with flare dampers on their engines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky for 30 miles . To go out at night without flare dampers simply increases the risk of interception . 2 . Our air crews , trained for daylight " precision " work under ideal weather conditions in the U. S. , are insufficiently trained in night-flying work to take part in operations against Germany . 3 . Our Air Force high command is stubbornly holding to a tactical concept not yet possible in Europe . Any one or all of these factors can be removed by a decision from Washington . Fortresses and Liberators now in Britain and , more important , those still coming off our assembly lines , can be fitted with built-in flare dampers . If we find it impossible to train our air crews for European night operations under American conditions , the final stages of their training could be carried out in blacked-out Britain , under U. S. Air Force instructors . The third factor , the temporary abandonment of mass daylight " precision " raids as our major air effort , must come from Washington . The American Air Force commanders in Britain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intend to bomb Germany by day . They were unable to do so during six long months of 1942 ? six valuable months in which a combined American-British bombing force might have brought Germany to her knees ? and every fact indicates that , as long as they insist on trying daylight operations , the full participation of Americans in the bombing of Germany will be far from a solid reality . It is no secret that new American bombers of much greater range , speed and bomb capacity are coming off the line . There would seem to be no reason why they should not be used with the British bomber force in the great mass raids that will beat Germany ? no reason except stubborn adherence to a single tactical concept . For their contribution to the allout bombing offensive the British must transfer enough skilled men to increase the production of their aircraft factories , and stop the diversion of bombers to the Admiralty . Germany can be bombed to defeat ? but only if enough American and British bombers fly together toward the same targets at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
