( See Cover ) Four days before the Great Invasion the aerial encirclement of Fortress Europe was completed . <P> U.S. Flying Fortresses took off from Italy , bombed rail targets in Rumania , flew straight on to new U.S. bases in the heart of the Soviet Ukraine . <P> From then on , every main base of attack on Germany was manned , at least in part , by Western Allied air power . Harassed German defense commanders had to rearrange their thinning squadrons to meet new bombing attacks from every direction . Allied air power had bombed around the compass . <P> The closing of that circle gave grim satisfaction to the man who commands U.S. Strategic Air Forces in Europe , brisk , wiry , peppery Lieut . General Carl Spaatz . <P> Now his bombers could shuttle back &; forth , pounding from all sides at Germany 's heart , destroying the enemy whom " Tooey " Spaatz hates . That hate and satisfaction he shared with Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris of the R.A.F. , his collaborator in bringing more physical damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Years ' War . <P> The Enemy Standard . German propagandists , hating and fearing Harris and Spaatz , called them the " aerial bandits . " But the Germans themselves had established the first bombing standards for World War II . In the celebrated blitz of 1940-41 , German planes attacked Britain with an average of 200 tons of bombs a night for about 100 nights . The " measuring stick " raid on Coventry saw about 275 tons fall in seven hours . <P> But now Berlin has received as many as 2,800 tons in half an hour . Last month the Allies dropped 147,000 tons on German targets ; this meant more than three tons a minute . The month 's total was 60 times greater than the bomb tonnage dropped by the Luftwaffe on Britain in all of 1943 . <P> General Henry H. Arnold , commander in chief of U.S. Army Air Forces , considering such figures , thinking of the 33 German cities that have been hit worse than Coventry , admitted frankly that it made him wonder : how could the Germans stand it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove itself the all-powerful weapon , the invasion will show what it has done . Most airmen are sure it has bled Germany white . <P> The Country Club . Tooey Spaatz is one of a little group of officers who kept the tiny Army Air Corps a going concern in the U.S. after World War I. The rest of the Army might snicker about " the Flying Country Club " and its publicity tricks , but the airmen kept right on . <P> " Hap " Arnold led a bomber flight to Alaska . Jimmy Doolittle was the first man to fly across the U.S. in less than 24 hours . Major General William Kepner ( the Eighth Air Force fighter commander ) flew around in a stratosphere balloon . Spaatz himself commanded the famous endurance flight of the Fokker monoplane Question Mark . In his crew were Lieut . General Ira Eaker , now Allied air commander in the Mediterranean , and Brigadier General Elwood ( " Pete " ) Quesada , Ninth Air Force fighter commander in Britain . <P> The Unteachable Gambler . Then as now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , who loved to have people around him , and could open up and talk fluently-especially on air power . At games he is an insatiable ( and unteachable ) gambler , and a hard competitor . He plays to win .
