" I 'm on a better wicket now and can say more than I could a week ago . " began tall , young Duncan Sandys ( rhymes with ampersands ) , facing a packed press conference in London . Lieut . Colonel Sandys - also M.P . and husband of Churchill 's daughter Diana-who has been in charge of Britain 's defense against buzzbombs , then gave the facts of the robot blitz , now ended : <P> In 80 days the robombs had damaged 870,000 English houses , killed 5,817 people , seriously wounded 17.036 others . <P> Allied counterattacks during 18 months against the rocket coast expended 2,900 airmen , 450 planes , 100,000 tons of bombs . <P> The Germans launched 8,000 one-ton robombs-an average of 100 a day , beginning June 16-of which 2,300 reached British targets . <P> Only Typhoons , new Spitfires and P-51 Mustangs could fly the 350-400 m.p.h. necessary to catch the robombs , but these fighters accounted for 1,900 . <P> Ack-ack guns shot down 1,500 robombs . Of the 2,800 guns , one-eighth were in U.S. batteries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half ago a WAF photo-interpreter , Flying Officer Constance Babington-Smith , gave the first alarm : she spotted a plane model in a picture taken over the German experimental station at Peenemnde . A black smudge around the model looked like the burn of a rocket blast . <P> One-third of all robombs launched got through to England the first week . By the final week , only 9% got through . <P> Among London 's hard hit districts ( Croydon , Woolwich , Greenwich , Orpington , Wandsworth , Lewisham , Beckenham , West Ham , Camberwell and Lambeth ) Croydon got it worst . Only 211 of its citizens were killed but 75% of its houses were damaged or destroyed ( Coventry 's percentage in the 1940 blitz : 66 ) . <P> One long-guarded secret : 92% of all casualties occurred in London . <P> Time for Rejoicing ? Britons naturally felt relieved at the end of the robot blitz . A few of them regarded this feeling as premature , fearing that V-2s might soon be dropping on Britain from within Germany itself . But few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still might represent for Britain . <P> As soon as the robot is improved in distance and accuracy , Britain will live permanently in range of a barrage from Europe . If another war starts , Britain and Germany may make a shambles of each other 's cities any morning , at the push of a button . <P> For that matter , if the robot is improved as much as the tank and the plane were between wars , one end of the shambles might be in New York .
