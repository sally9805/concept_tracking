The high period of poster art was celebrated last week in Manhattan . Hanging on the Norlyst Gallery walls were some 37 of the bold-hued works which peeled off Parisian litho-stones in the ' 80s and ' 90s and plastered the boulevard kiosks of those gaudy decades . <P> That was a period when the top French painters recognized no distinction between commercial and " pure " art-and when many took advertising commissions . Inevitably dominating the show , as he did the posters of his time , was the work of stunted , aristocratic Henri-Marie-Raymond de Toulouse-Lautrec Monfa , who put his hand to almost every variety of graphic art . But also shown were works by Lautrec 's finest contemporaries : Jean Louis Forain , Alexandre Thophile Steinlen , James Ensor , Jules Chret , Albert Guillaume , F. A. Cazals ( one poster showed Poet Paul Verlaine at an exhibition ) . <P> Most of the posters were theater , music-hall and circus advertisements . They formed a kind of profane Audubon collection of the night birds of Paris . A whole aviary was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Folies-Bergre , showing the scintillant plumage of the Folies , from the top hats in the lobby to the trapeze artists on the stage . <P> Collectors have long been interested in such huge , gay sheets . Good poster items currently bring as much as $200 . The poster master , Toulouse-Lautrec , had no need of funds either from advertisers or collectors . His father was so well heeled that he could afford such eccentricities as an otter hunt , in Canadian costume , in the streets of Paris .
