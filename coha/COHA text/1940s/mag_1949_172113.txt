Stalking out of a meeting of the Republican National Committee last January , one disgruntled committeeman grated : " I 'll give that guy just six months more . " Last week , almost six months to the day , the committeeman saw his prophecy come true . In the interest of " harmony in our ranks , " National Chairman Hugh D. Scott Jr . quit his job . <P> To a large extent , Hugh Scott , an agreeable , pipe-smoking Philadelphia lawyer , was a belated casualty of last November 's election . Hand-picked by Candidate Tom Dewey last summer in payment for Pennsylvania 's timely convention support , he had served out the campaign as a sort of front man for Dewey 's own strategy board ( after the election , he not only admitted this fact , but advertised it ) . When the Dewey strategists vanished from sight , Chairman Scott was still standing there , pipe in hand , a patient smile on his face , and looking as if this was nothing compared to what he had seen out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued . Scott won his first skirmish with Republican rebels at the Omaha harmony and hair-pulling meeting last winter , when he got a 54 to 50 " vote of confidence " ( TIME , Feb. 7 ) . Since then he had been trying to find a platform that everybody could stand on , while critics thought he should have been out raising money . Congressmen felt that they , not he , should do the thinking about issues . As the wrangling increased , contributions dropped off : in the first five months of this year the committee had raised only $73,630 to meet expenses of $313,673A group of rebels from all party factions met in Pittsburgh early this month and demanded Scott 's head . Now that they had it , they were not sure just whom they wanted in his place. * Among the likeliest candidates : New Jersey 's National Committeeman Guy Gabrielson , Michigan 's National Committeeman Arthur Summerfield , Nebraska 's State Chairman A. T. ( " Bert " ) Howard . <P> <P> * The New York World-Telegram offered a suggestion : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis . Settle with him after the ballots are counted . Pay him nothing if the party does n't do better than it has in the last 18 years . Pay him a graduated bonus if he increases the Republican vote . Ought to try something to put some incentive into the G.O.P. "
