txt Nazis , angered by British bombing of Berlin and other cities , reported tonight that the German Air Fleet was roaring against London again in an offensive that would be pressed relentlessly until the British capitulate . New waves of German bombers flying against London will carry out remorseless and incessant warfare , Nazis said , until " the smoking ruins of industrial and military objectives , decimation of the British Air Force and shattered morale of the British people bring into power a government that will accept German terms . " The German terms were regarded here as unconditional capitulation . Official German quarters were silent regarding any peace terms , but there were many unofficial suggestions that the collapse of Britain is " only a matter of weeks . " The Nazi press said that " now it is an eye-for-an-eye and a toothfor-a-tooth " battle and said that " the sword of the German air force strikes pitilessly . " " What effects the heavy caliber bombs have were clearly revealed by Warsaw and Rotterdam , " one newspaper said . " If London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then let Herr Churchill and his criminal clique continue to send pirates at night to Germany . " The Propaganda Ministry said that from May 10 to Aug. 31 British air raids over Germany had killed 78 children , seriously wounded 29 and slightly wounded 22 . Attacks on London Continue Wireless to Tao Now YORZ Tam . BERLIN , Sept. ** German attack on London is reported to have // and that the day 's raids were " completely successful . " Reconnaissance planes reportedly flew over London and photographed the damaged area as well as objectives not yet attacked . These and other factors  --  such as the new habit of General Headquarters of emphasising British attacks on non-military objectives in its reports  --  appear to be part of the propaganda action on the part of the German press , which one authoritative comment sums up in the words , " Berlin unrolls the list of England 's guilt . " It is an indication , this came comment adds , that " England 's guilt " will henceforth " play a more important role in considerations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " retaliatory " action against London , this comment points out , " this is of particular importance . " If , after a further period of time , the comment concludes , " further sections of London are blasted into the abyss of destruction , then the world must remember that it was English statesmen and their press who opposed the initial stages of German retaliatory action with their mockery and with new challenges in the form of further attacks on Berlin , Hamburg and other German cities . " Yesterday British losses were placed by General Headquarters at 44 planes of which two allegedly were brought down by German antiaircraft artillery . The Germans lost 21 machines , it was said . In the initial paragraph of its report General Headquarters notes that British planes last night dropped bombs on various places in North Germany " far from military objectives " and that in Berlin as well as other cities " civilian dwellings were more or less seriously damaged . " The Germans assert the British are wrong if they describe the present attack as the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still only the " Battle of London . " It is asserted by the Voelkischer Beobachter that the " Battle of England will follow after the Battle of London has been brought to a merciless conclusion . " " For nobody , " the paper continues , " could have expected that this city would remain untouched by the war . As the nerve center and political , economic and financial capital of the empire , it presents in an era of total warfare an outstanding military objective . To paralyze and eliminate London in its most important functions must of necessity be the war aim of any military opponent of Great Britain . " Authoritative German quarters consider these remarks to be a " revealing characterization of the present phase of the campaign and of the further developments that are expected to follow . " " It speaks for the systematic character of the present German operations , " these quarters conclude , " and shows that they are an important part of the general war plan which is being consistently followed . " Yesterday 's actions , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by bad weather . But clear or cloudy , it is stated , the pillar of smoke and flame over London guides German fliers to their targets and yesterday and last night likewise the attack rolled on . Hat ' - ors , docks , gas , electricity and water works were again pounded with bombs of all calibres , further paralyzing London 's vital industries and adding to the inferno of flame . One flying war correspondent speaks of " the thousands who are lost beyond all hope of rescue in that glowing hell . " He speaks of one burning area " as large as from Berlin 's Potsdamerplatz to Alexanderplatz , " which is , approximately , the distance from Times Square to Columbus Circle . He describes it as " an unbroken sea of licking flame . " Of the " thousands lost " in London , he says , " they were not really the guilty ones , but they tool celebrated in advance the promised destruction of the German capital and the nameless misery of German women , mothers and children foreseen by England . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident this same note not only of the " total guilt " of the British people as implied by this German war writer but also of the alleged constant and repeated bombing by British of civilians in the Reich , of the intention ascribed to the British of starving helpless German women and children , of the grinding of the Reich forever into dust after their victory . The Hamburger Fremdenblatt thus writes : " The British must not wonder if the retaliatory blows of the German air force become ever more terrible and more destructive . " The Nachtausgabe states that " this which the British call terror is justified retribution , " adding , " if however , in accordance with the will of the British one party must be destroyed then it will and must be England . " The Diplomatisch-Politische Korrespondenz , reflecting the views of Wilhelmstrasse , concludes : " England in all truth has no right to protest  --  nor have those who hitherto protested when civilians lost their lives in the course of actions carried through by legal German weapons against centers of British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hard though they may be , are , in any case , more chivalrous and more decent than cowardly , throttling trips of the British who , hoping they wont be caught , wish to bring death and starvation to the German people .
