With pardonable pride , WPB announced that the U.S. had produced more than 7,000 military aircraft in May , would beat that total in June . With something less than pardonable reticence , it was mum about the rest of the military production program . It was not so bright a picture as WPB 's announcement of aircraft production indicated it might be . <P> One day after the plane announcement , blunt Robert Porter Patterson , War Under Secretary , told the unpretty rest . In May , production of materiel for the Army Ground Forces had declined 3% from the output of April . Actually , it had been scheduled to rise 2% . So it was a 5% failure in production . <P> Said Bob Patterson : " This means that troops in training must be deprived of critical equipment . ... If this situation continues even our overseas troops will suffer . ... I ... attribute the letdown . . . to overconfidence . . . . <P> " Failure to appreciate the gravity of our situation ... is evidenced by the coal strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by the tendency of certain manufacturers to divert too much time , thought and energy to the design and development of competitive civilian nonessentials . . . . The failure of May production is the most critical single occurrence in the Army Supply Program . . . . Failures to meet production in one month can not be readily made up . . . . " <P> Only by aircraft 's showing was the War Department pleased . Of the plus-7,000 planes delivered in May , around 5,000 were tactical types . The total number produced was up 40% from January , the weight ( more bombers ) up 63% . Barring failures , the U.S. was going to meet and pass its goal of 60,000 for this calendar year . <P> Bob Patterson 's unspoken point was that wars are not fought by aircraft alone . Before Congress last week was the vastest military appropriation bill in history : a $71-billion program for everything the Army will need in fiscal 1944 , from dog food ( $3 million ) to ammunition ( $8 billion ) , guns , tanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion-the largest single item ) . With such a job ahead , neither labor nor industry could loaf for a minute .
