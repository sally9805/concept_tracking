On his first night in Canada , Harry Truman was guest of honor at a state dinner given by Governor General Alexander at Rideau Hall . All the Cabinet members ( and their wives ) were there except Health Minister Paul Martin . As Prime Minister Mackenzie King introduced the absent member 's handsome wife to the President , he elaborately explained that Mr. Martin , as the youngest Cabineteer , had been delegated to keep the Government represented in the House of Commons . Said Harry Truman to Mrs. Martin : " No minister could be better represented . " <P> By morning the President 's gallant remark was all over Ottawa . With six little words , Harry Truman had taken the starchy formality out of an occasion which had been forbiddingly billed as the first state visit by a U.S. President to Canada. * <P> The Red Carpet . From the start , the President had been as informal as he could . For his red-carpet reception at a railway siding on the outskirts of the city , he wore striped pants with a grey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his greeters . On the seven-mile drive to Government House he waved his black Homburg and flashed easy smiles for the thousands of Ottawans lining the streets . There was no fiesta air . Ottawans are many emotional miles distant from Mexico City . There was not even as much enthusiasm as there had been for Champion Figure Skater Barbara Ann Scott ( TIME , March 17 ) . But there were subdued cheers and polite handclapping . <P> Next morning , after an early walk in the grounds of Rideau Hall ( bright with tulips and lilacs ) , the President ran through the ceremonial part of his visit . At the U.S. Embassy he received staff members and their families . Then , as the carillon clanged out The Missouri Waltz , the President , now in frock coat and silk hat , walked across the street to the Parliament Building with Mackenzie King . The House of Commons chamber was full . Bess Truman , in the Speaker 's Gallery , smiled down from under a huge white hat. * <P> Truman Doctrine ( II ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in Kansas City . But he had warm words for his audience , for the French in Canada , for Canada as a whole and for U.S.-Canadian relations . Time &; again he was interrupted by the desk-thumping of M.P.s and handclaps from the deskless Senators . <P> Then the U.S. President spoke , out to the world , restating and clarifying U.S. foreign policy . Said he : " We seek a peaceful world , a prosperous world , a free world , a world of good neighbors , living on terms of equality and mutual respect . . . . We intend to support those who are determined to govern themselves in their own way , and who honor the right of others to do likewise . We intend to aid those who seek to live at peace with their neighbors , without coercing or being coerced , without intimidating or being intimidated . We intend to uphold those who respect the dignity of the individual . . . . " <P> The President had been interrupted 37 times by increasing applause before he reached his punch line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who share these objectives and ideals . With such friends we face the future unafraid . " The speech over , Prime Minister King rose to lead the assembly in " Three cheers and a tiger . " The members were so excited , they gave four and a half cheers , and forgot the tiger .
