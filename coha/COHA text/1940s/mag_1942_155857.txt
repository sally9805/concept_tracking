On New Year 's Eve , a little group of men gathered on the river bank at Poughkeepsie . Some of them were oldtime rivermen . Others were just old inhabitants of Poughkeepsie or from Highland , across the river-men who had ridden the Poughkeepsie ferry countless times , like their grandfathers and great-grandfathers before them . <P> The side-wheeler Brinckerhoff , veteran of 41 years on the Hudson River , carried the quiet group through the river-damp darkness , across the stream and back . Its searchlight picked out Poughkeepsie 's Main Street . Its steel-hooped sides girded against the groaning wooden racks . The Poughkeepsie ferry , tarnation old , almost as old as the nation ( it had crisscrossed the Hudson since 1798 ) , had made its last run . <P> All over the land ferries had stopped or were slowing to a stop . In the old days , in big river towns , the ferryboat captain was a man of dignity and wealth . Along narrow streams deep in the country there were leisurely men in overalls who pulled a flatboat across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model-T Ford . <P> But concrete highways and concrete-and-steel bridges made the ferry obsolescent . When the Mid-Hudson Bridge was opened in 1930 , the Poughkeepsie ferry , which once had three boats in constant service , hit its fatal snag . By undercutting the bridge toll ( 25 to 50 ) , it managed to keep one boat going . Last week , when the bridge toll came down to 35 , the line gave up . On the old Brinckerhoff , lashed to the landing , the fires went dead .
