Only three weeks ago , New York 's Mayor William O'Dwyer seemed to be running for re-election on a platform of love , and he was getting gladsome publicity from the press . Last week , the election won , Bill O'Dwyer ruefully learned the lesson of the sorcerer 's apprentice : it is hard to stop a flood . <P> During the campaign , O'Dwyer and slender , pretty Sloan Simpson , thirtyish ex-model , had willingly and smilingly posed for photographers wherever they went . To a reporter who asked if a wedding was in the offing , O'Dwyer had coyly replied : " I 'll discuss that after election . " Then , leaning back in his chair , he had whistled Some Enchanted Evening . <P> Yearning for a little post-election privacy 59-year-old Bill O'Dwyer last week whisked Sloan Simpson into a green and white police plane and flew off into the wild blue yonder . The press was caught flatfooted . Two hours later the City Hall gave out a statement : " The mayor and Miss Sloan Simpson are at the Gideon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guests of Mr. &; Mrs. Martin J. Sweeney . " Guessing at an elopement , a swarm of newsmen and photographers lit out for Saratoga , there cornered the flustered mayor . Was it wedding bells that the reporters heard ? Snapped O'Dwyer : , " No comment . " <P> It was no way to get rid of the horde of newsmen and their presence was enough to try the patience of any elderly suitor . O'Dwyer was miffed at the press anyway ; only one out of the ten New York newspapers had supported the mayor in his campaign . Finally , he blew up and , wagging his pipe , roared : " There 's absolutely nothing to the report I 'll marry this weekend . It 's all a dirty , contemptible carrying-on on the part of the press . " <P> When that outburst failed to clear out the unashamed newsmen , the mayor warned that " either you get out of here this afternoon or I will . " While he damned all the hullabaloo as an unreasonable invasion of his privacy , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also ; his secret departure had been a sure way to bring the press tallyhoing after him . Said one reporter sourly : " We do n't like this business any more than you do . I 'd like to get out of here and take in a football game . " At that , O'Dwyer tried futilely to get a plane to take him away . <P> Not till next morning was he able to leave . Then he hustled Miss Simpson into his limousine , raced to the airport at 70 m.p.h. , and flew off in the police plane . <P> The next thing reporters knew , the mayor popped up at his office at City Hall alone and met another horde of newsmen . One of them tossed a copy of the New York World-Telegram on his desk and pointed to a story of a baker who said he was delivering a wedding cake to the mayor this week . Any comment ? Snapped the mayor : " Take that paper off my desk . " The " merciless intrusion " of the press , he moaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendship with Miss Simpson . "
