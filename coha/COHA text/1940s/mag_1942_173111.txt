For a few hours last week U.S. truckmen were given a brief glimpse of heaven . To speed war transportation , the Governors of all 48 States promised Jesse Jones they would accept a uniform national code of trucking regulations and would set up nationwide reciprocity on licenses . <P> By week 's end this vision of free wheeling was somewhat faded . Some States are complying , but it takes more than a Governor 's word in most to upset overnight a legislative irresponsibility that has been 20 years a-growing . Transport Topics , truckmen 's weekly newspaper , ran a column-long , front-page editorial full of such charges as " Texas has taken no steps to comply , " and " Definitely all trade barriers in New Mexico are not down . " But when and if the Governors ' promises are kept , they will remove one of the most important barriers to free movement of interstate commerce envisioned by the Federal Constitution .
