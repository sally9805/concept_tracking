Letters to The Times ro THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The Independent Citizens ' Committee of the Arts , Sciences and Professions , in an advertisement in THE TIMES of Jan. 23 , supports the wage demands of strikers by advancing the purchasing power fallacy . The argument is that the welfare of all " is directly linked up with labor 's capacity to buy goods and services . " The committee feels that the unions are working for the best interests of the national economy in their efforts to maintain the country 's pay envelopes , purchasing power , employment rolls and production quotas at 1941-1945 levels . The fallacy is in assuming that our prosperity depends on prices rather than on the - quantity of goods produced . If we produce more clothing , more shoes , more automobiles , more radios , more of everything , then we have more to consume . The superficial theory is that if organized workers receive higher wages , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ output , consumption and the general welfare . Sources of Increases This conclusion , however , is demolished by a complete analysis of all the facts . The wage increases of the organized workers come from two sources : 1 . From consumers , who pay higher prices for the goods produced by organized workers ; 2 . From investors , who receive lower profits and dividends . The increased purchasing power of workers who receive the wage increases is offset by the decreased purchasing power of consumers and investors . The statement in the advertisement that " the welfare of the butcher , the baker , the grocer , * * * the doctor , the dentist , * * * the farmer , etc. , is directly linked up with labor 's capacity to buy goods and services " is false . If the purchasing power theory is correct , then the fees of physicians and lawyers should be increased , the profits of merchants should be increased , the dividends of stockholders should be increased , the rents received by landlords should be increased , so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more goods and thus increase the welfare of all groups . Obviously , if the money income of each group was doubled , this increase of purchasing power would not increase the general welfare or the consumption of goods . Each transaction involves a buyer and a seller . If the price is increased , the gain to the seller equals the loss to the buyer . Increase for Everybody If wage increases can bring greater prosperity , we should not be niggardly in using such a magic formula . We should increase the money incomes of every group  --  not just wageworkers  --  and the increase should be 100 per cent or 500 per cent , not an insignificant 30 per cent . The advocates of the purchasing power theory are never willing to take full advantage of their great discovery . The labor union drives in 1936 and 1937 pushed hourly rates in manufacturing from 59.9 cents in 1935 to 69.5 cents in 1937 . According to the purchasing power theory , this should have brought great prosperity in 1938 . But in 1938 employment in manufacturing was 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income dropped from ; 555 in 1937 to $495 in 1938 . Apparently the rise in union wage rates in 1937 did not help the butcher , the baker and the candlestick maker . When poets , singers and actors seek to enlighten the public in regard to economic theories , it would probably be desirable for them to have their program ? analyzed by a. competent economist . This is an age of specialization , and while few economists are good singers or actors , it would be strange , indeed , if many artists were good economists . JOHN W. SCOVILLE . Detroit , Jan. 29 , 1946 . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In his letter to THE TIMES of Jan. 28 A. Philip Randolph answered briefly and clearly many of the staple objections to the proposed legislation for a permanent Fair Employment Practices Commission . While in any proposal there is usually room for correction and improvement , there can be no doubt in my mind of the truth of the basic issue , which is that we need effective FEPC legislation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such legislation will strike down many of the principal obstacles which now exist to an equal employment opportunity at a time when inequality in this matter is a grave national menace . Its existence in any part of the country is a threat to the whole . In an address delivered in Washington on Jan. 23 Secretary of Labor Schwellenbach gave the fundamental answer to the objection that in these troublesome times it is inappropriate to raise this issue . Said Mr. Schwellenbach : " If that argument is valid , it must of necessity rest for its validity upon the assumption that the issue is unimportant . With that assumption I disagree . I disagree because I believe that this issue is a moral one . The time is never inappropriate to consider moral issues . * * We can not propose to become virtuous as citizens next year or the year thereafter . " Nobody clings more tenaciously than I do to the principle that you can not change people 's morals by mere legislation . But no serious proponent of the FEPC entertains such an idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudices but of placing a penalty on tangible and certifiable anti-social and criminal acts . The bill 's proponents do hold , however , that the existence of such an agency is of itself an indispensable means for promoting and focusing on concrete issues a type of education that will not result in mere wishful thinking but will bear constructive results . " It is highly symbolic , " says Mr. Schwellenbach , " that the FEPC legislation should be the first among the President 's program to come to the floor of the Congress . It is a test of our willingness to practice democracy as well as preach it . " ( The Rev. ) JOHN LAFARGE , S. J. , Editor of America . New York , Jan. 31 , 1946 . Benefit for Navy Personnel To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES ! A bill in the House of Representatives would extend the benefits of accumulated leave to the enlisted personnel in the Navy . At present this bill is tied up in committee and apparently it * going to die there . The bill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of two and a half days a month for each month of active duty , up to 120 days , or a lump sum payment upon discharge for the days of leaves that the man missed . This set-up is now in effect for Navy officers . Under the present deal it is possible for them to receive , after going out of the service , up to $1,600 for leave they did not receive in the service . This bill would give financial remuneration to enlisted men who also lost days of leave . Passage would mean much to the three and a half million men discharged or to be discharged . WILLIAM J. SPANGLER . Norfolk , Va. , Jan. 27 , 1946 . Referendum Held Illegal To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMMS : The submission of a proposed sale of the subway power plants to a referendum presents a question of legality that does not seem to have entered the public discussion of the matter . Referenda are exercises of the legislative power reserved by Section 40 of the City Charter for special situations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not within the power of the Mayor to enlarge the orbit of the referendum procedure . Section 21 of the Charter vests the legislative power of the city in the Council , subject to . the veto power of the Mayor in all oases , of the Board of Estimate in a limited class of oases , and of the voters in the narrow field described in Section 40 . MILTON H. HARRIS . New York , Jan. 24 , 1946 . Subway Door Suggestion To THIVEDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In your newspaper a letter from Will Close suggested that signs be displayed in the subways in an effort to get the people to leave by the center doors , permitting entrance by the end dome . Mr. Close is evidently unaware that originally the center doors were marked as entrances and the end doors as exits . It was a fine idea , only It did not work , I have thought that something might be gained by putting large posters on the outside of subway doors with some such legend as , Met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more stupid than for people to crowd around the doors of a subway car , as they always do , in. blind indifference to the fact that people are going to emerge . SAMUEL F. B. HOSTETTER 34 , Princeton , N. J. , Jan. 25 , 1946 . Buying Power Held Fallacy Theory Advanced by Committee Viewed as Opposed to Economics fied with the law 's delay or ? thee ineptness , would do as business men generally do  --  keep out of the courts . Labor and management would find the way to compose their differences without recourse to the courts . But if they did not agree , neither side should have the right to take the law into his own hands either by strike , lockout or other means . They must go to a court of law and abide by its decisions . JACOB KRISEL . New York , Jan. 26 , 1946 . Permanent FEPC Is Favored Legislation , Both National and Local , Seen as Pressing Need Subway Coughers Scored To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Tams : It hitting some one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assault and battery , then reckless coughing in a crowded subway train without covering one 's mouth is assault and battery too . The invisible virus expelled by a cough moves into a neighbor 's respiratory tract with the speed of a bullet . It lurks in the air after the perpetrator has gone . The physical suffering , loss of efficiency , time lost from work and cost of medical care are so real as to demolish the claim that " what you do n't see ca n't hurt you . " Indeed , I should like to see representative subway riders deputized by the Board of Health to enforce the section of the Sanitary Code adopted to combat the flu epidemic during World War I. That section makes it unlawful to persist in coughing or sneezing in the subway without covering the mouth and nose . It is as vital to apprehend violators of this section as it is to arrest those who otherwise knock out peaceful citizens . HAROLD ROLAND SHAPIRO . New York , Jan. 31 , 1946 . Industrial Courts Advocated To THE EDITOR or Tim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Neither should it temporize with fact-finding , cooling-off or other makeshifts . Government should furnish industrial courts to decide controversies between labor and management , just as it furnishes courts for all citizens to decide all other controversies .
