In their pre-World War I heyday U. S. Socialists boasted a potent press . Under Debs 's leadership the Socialist weekly Appeal to Reason ran its circulation up to 5,000,000 ; the New York Call once had a million readers . Of such might , the mere remaining shadow is the Manhattan weekly , the New Leader . Under forced draft it pulls 43,000 readers-mostly among Manhattan and Hollywood malcontents and old Socialists who sigh for the good old days . Its assistant editor-tireless , 5 ft. 2 in . Victor Riesel-is also most of the New Leader 's editorial staff ( he writes under five noms de guerre and is the New Leader 's Washington Bureau besides ) . <P> Last week the New Leader emerged briefly from obscurity . One dark night its offices were rifled by unknown footpads . <P> For outsiders the raid drew attention to the New Leader 's main claim to distinction-as bellwether for exile and native anti-Communists in the U. S. Among them : Willi Schlamm , leader at 16 of the Austrian Communist Party , one of the first to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; the late General Walter Krivitsky . For Editor Riesel these characteristic contributors afforded a probable reason for the visit : Communist footpads were looking for the address of Richard Julius Herman Krebs , alias Jan Valtin , ex-Communist author of Out of the Night , currently best-selling Baedeker of the Stalinist underworld . The raiders found no addresses .
