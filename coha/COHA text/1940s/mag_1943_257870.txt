Because Britain 's major parties have contrived to postpone a general election until further notice , occasional by-elections to fill vacancies in Parliament are the best indications of political trends . Last week a by-election at Eddisbury ( TIME , March 29 ) suggested a trend away from the principal , trucing parties ( Labor , Conservative , Liberal ) . <P> After three fizzling tries , the new Common Wealth Party elected its first Member of Parliament : R.A.F. Warrant Officer John Loverseed defeated Thomas Peacock , the candidate endorsed by Winston Churchill 's predominantly conservative National Government . What the people of Eddisbury voted for was best explained by Common Wealth 's zealous founder , Sir Richard Acland ( who holds a Commons seat as a Liberal ) . Said he : <P> " We want to amalgamate the Russian economic system with our own democratic political system . . . . We are going to become a country without big capitalists . That is what we are righting for and the ordinary workers and soldiers are going to see to it that they are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last war . We are going to see to it that the community comes first and self-interest second . Capitalism is completely finished . " <P> Common Origin . Common Wealth had its first discernible origin in 1940 , when philanthropic , wildly socialistic , 36-year-old Sir Richard launched his Forward March Movement with the slogan : " Liberty , Equality , and Material Well Being . " In early 1941 , Author J. B. Priestley and a group of other intellectuals prodded the Churchill Government with a manifesto demanding a definition of Britain 's war and peace aims , a more positive social consciousness . <P> Last year Priestley and Acland channeled their strength in a merger : the Common Wealth Party . Unhappy in the common harness , Priestley resigned . Sir Richard took sole charge . <P> The election of one Common Wealth M.P . did not prove that either capitalism or Winston Churchill is finished in Britain . It did prove that the people of Eddisbury are dissatisfied with the static , enervating truce which now binds their established parties and the Churchill Government .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
