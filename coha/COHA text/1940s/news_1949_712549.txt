txt Suppose the Republicans were to start competing with the Democrats in the field of social welfare up from the local communities and in the states rather than down from Washington . If such a thing happened , it might make quite a difference in the American political picture . Perhaps a lot of voters would decide that . local welfare is more in the American tradition than federal welfare . Nationally , Republicans are a long way from making any such project a major plank in their political platforms . But in Kansas , Republican leaders are backing an ambitious experiment in the field of medicine which they think may be the answer to the Truman drive for federally socialized medicine . And the important thing about it is that if Kansas Republicans promote a successful alternative to socialized medicine , they can use the same formula in other fields of social welfare . That the experiment is in the field of medicine is incidental . The important thing is that Kansas Republicans have decided they ca n't beat the welfare state with anything less than another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better one . A A A What has happened in Kansas is largely accidental . It was not something the Republicans planned , but something the Republicans embraced , and with enthusiasm . It ' started when a Kansan , Franklin D. Murphy , was appointed dean of the University of Kansas Medical School on July 1 , 1948 . The new dean hadideas . One of them was to improve and enlarge his school . Another was to halt and reverse the migration of doctors from rural communities to the cities . By December of 1948 he had worked his ideas into a " Kansas Plan " and published them in the Kansas Government Journal . The plan was in three parts . First , . there would be enlargement of the state medical school . Second , there would be a campaign to induce local communities to organize community clinics at community expense and thus offer to young and penniless doctors ' the means of setting up shop . Third , there would be periodic refresher courses at the ? universi ty . In January , 1949 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republican State Legislature adopted the plan by overwhelming vote . That included an appropriation of $4,500,000 to the state medical school . Since then two small Kansas communitiesqzmcq#Louth and Mankato  --  have financed and set up community clinics . Several others are reported getting their campaigns under way . A A A Cynics and political opponents tend to dismiss the whole thing as little more than an able device for obtaining an extra appropriation for the state university . They doubt particularly the likelihood of many small communities going through with the clinics . Republicans are charged with merely climbing aboard , a bright idea thought up by someone , else . It remains to . be seen , of course , whether the Kansas Plan will become so successful and so generally popular that it will take the wind out of the Truman administration 's federal health sails . And , of course , there is little comfort in possible Republican sponsorship of such a formula for those who are looking for tax relief instead of a substitute for federal welfare . Local welfare can cost just as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the point of view of politics this Kansas plan could be dynamite . The essence of it is the idea of community responsibility as opposed to federal uniformity . There is political appeal in local initiative and local responsibility . It makes for more flexibility . It can more accurately fit the differing needs of differing communities . There could be more leeway for those groups which do not rely on medicine . And it might at least halt the steady drift of power from the states to Washington . Republicans have not done noticeably well . at the polls when their rallying cry was opposition to the welfare state . They might do better were they to sponsor community welfare as opposed to federal welfare . Kansas Republican leaders think they have something with real vote appeal . They are using it to try to keep the Democrats away from their Kansas door . If its requires fighting welfare with welfare , they are prepared try it ; in fact , they are trying We might-see a new form of Republicanism coming out of Kansas . .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
