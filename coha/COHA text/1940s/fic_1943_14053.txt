1790 . A section of the deck of a schooner . A star-lit night , wind in the sails , rushing water , the creak of tackle . A middle-aged man and a girl lean on the ship 's rail and gaze out over the ocean : JEFFERSON and his daughter PATSY . He is tall and thin , his face too sensitive , a gentleness almost womanish written on it . He has dispensed with the wig of the period . His hair , ruffled by the winds , is reddish , streaked with gray . The girl is in her late teens , vibrant , lithe , handsome . Above them a helmsman , in shadow , steers the ship . The CAPTAIN approaches them . CAPTAIN Evening , sir . THOMAS JEFFERSON Good evening , Captain . PATSY RANDOLPH Are we nearing land , Captain ? CAPTAIN If we hold to our course . Gittin ' impatient ? PATSY laughs . THOMAS JEFFERSON Tell me , does the voyage home always take forever ? CAPTAIN Longer'n that , sometime . Looks at the sky.May blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' below . He salutes , goes off . PATSY and JEFFERSON stare out over the ocean . PATSY RANDOLPH I wonder will the house be the way I remember it . THOMAS JEFFERSON Not as large , perhaps . You were only a little lady when we left . PATSY RANDOLPH How long ago that seems ! THOMAS JEFFERSON Does n't it ? PATSY RANDOLPH It 's odd . Now that we 're coming home again , all those years in Paris suddenly seem so unreal , do n't they , Papa ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Yes . She sighs . JEFFERSON looks at her , smiles . p. 3 PATSY RANDOLPH Are we going to New York first ? THOMAS JEFFERSON shakes his head:Direct to Monticello . PATSY RANDOLPH I thought you might want to see President Washington at once . THOMAS JEFFERSON We 'll go home first and arrange your wedding . PATSY RANDOLPH Wo n't the president be waiting your answer ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Not particularly  --  no . Pause . PATSY RANDOLPH Papa ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Yes , dear ? PATSY RANDOLPH I 've been wondering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should put it off ? My wedding ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Put it off ? PATSY RANDOLPH If you accept the president 's offer , you 'll have to live in New York . You 'll be alone for the first time in your life . You 'll be utterly miserable . I know you too well . THOMAS JEFFERSON But I have no intention of accepting . PATSY RANDOLPH You have n't ? THOMAS JEFFERSON He 's given me the option of refusal . And I certainly mean to take advantage of it . PATSY RANDOLPH vastly relieved : p. 4 Why did n't you tell me ? THOMAS JEFFERSON It never occurred to me . Pause.You see , dearest , I discovered a long time ago that Nature did n't make me for public office . I accepted the French post only because  --  at the time  --  your mother 's death had left me so blank . I fancied a change of scene would He breaks off . PATSY RANDOLPH I know , Father . A long pause as they both stare into space.Strange out there . THOMAS JEFFERSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish she were waiting for us at home . THOMAS JEFFERSON Your mother ? PATSY RANDOLPH Yes . I never think of Monticello without thinking of her . She used to love to tell me about yourwedding night . THOMAS JEFFERSON Did she ? PATSY RANDOLPH In the garden cottage , midst such a clutter of your drawings and your books and your inventions , you could hardly move about . THOMAS JEFFERSON smiles:That 's right . PATSY RANDOLPH And how you lit a fire , and found half a bottle of wine a workman had left behind some books . And mother played the pianoforte and you your violin , and you sang old songs . The wind rises . JEFFERSON draws his cloak tighter . p. 5 THOMAS JEFFERSON It is blowing up a bit . Excuse me . He starts off . PATSY RANDOLPH Where are you going ? THOMAS JEFFERSON I want to take a look at your sister . PATSY RANDOLPH She 's asleep , Father . THOMAS JEFFERSON She 'll have kicked off her blanket . She might catch a chill . We do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . PATSY RANDOLPH calls after him:Father ! THOMAS JEFFERSON off:Yes ? PATSY RANDOLPH I 'll go . You wait here . THOMAS JEFFERSON All right , dear . Reenters . PATSY RANDOLPH I 'll be right back . PATSY goes . JEFFERSON stares off toward the horizon . The hypnotic surge of the water The moonlight fades until he and the ship become a single silhouette in the night . Soft music dimly heard Slowly , dancing as if on the ocean , the exterior of an enchanting house materializes . Monticello ! Snow is falling and has piled deep around it . p. 6 Laughter is heard offstage . TOM JEFFERSON , a young man , and MARTHA , a young woman , radiantly beautiful , appear , shaking the snow off their cloaks . MARTHA JEFFERSON Was there ever such a wedding night ? I declare , Tom Jefferson , those last few miles the horses fairly flew through the snow . THOMAS JEFFERSON points to the house:There it is , Martha . MARTHA turns , gasps . MARTHA JEFFERSON Oh , Tom ! THOMAS JEFFERSON You like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really designed this , yourself ? THOMAS JEFFERSON For you , Martha . Takes her hand . MARTHA JEFFERSON It 's incredibly lovely . THOMAS JEFFERSON Your hand is like ice . Come ! MARTHA JEFFERSON No ! I want to stand here and look at it a minute more . Please ! THOMAS JEFFERSON It 'll be ready for us to move into by April . Till then we 'll use the garden cottage . Apologetically.It 's only one room . MARTHA JEFFERSON laughs : p. 7 Like a couple of dormice . We wo n't stir till spring . Looks about , enchanted . Points offstage.Your Blue Ridge Mountains are out there ? THOMAS JEFFERSON nods:There 's one peak , Martha , the sun tips with pure gold . And from here Nature spreads a magic carpet below  --  rocks , rivers , mountains , forests MARTHA JEFFERSON I ca n't wait for morning . THOMAS JEFFERSON When stormy weather 's brewing , you can look down into her workshop and see her fabricating clouds and hail and snow and lightning  --  at your feet . MARTHA JEFFERSON Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JEFFERSON I ca n't tell you what you 've done for me . THOMAS JEFFERSON What I 've done for you ? MARTHA JEFFERSON Before I met you , circumstances and the intolerance of little men had begun to make me lose faith . The earth had begun to shrink . Living had become something quite unimportant . Then , the night we met , after the gay chatter , when you began to talk gravely , I suddenly fell in love , not only with you . I fell in love with the possibilities of the whole race of man . She stops short . He is gazing at her , laughing . p. 8 Now , what are you laughing at , Mr. Jefferson ? THOMAS JEFFERSON If I live to be a thousand and close my eyes  --  this is the way I 'll see you , my love . With snow on your face and your eyes shining !

THOMAS JEFFERSON Forever and ever  --  and ever . She shivers.You shivered ? You are cold . The light begins to fade . MARTHA JEFFERSON A bit ! THOMAS JEFFERSON Come , Mrs. Jefferson . He sweeps her up in his arms.We 'll light a fire that will warm you to the end of time ! He carries her off . Suddenly the roar of a rising wind . Men 's voices far off . p. 9 CAPTAIN offstage:Port quarter ! Monticello fades and vanishes . CAPTAIN enters , approaches the dreaming silhouette of JEFFERSON .

" Many voices offstage . Exit CAPTAIN . The babble of men 's voices raised in argument . Another vision appears in space . Young JEFFERSON , seated at a desk , a manuscript before him . As the voices are heard , he looks from one antagonist to another . FIRST VOICE Georgia votes nay . SECOND VOICE This document is a mass of glittering generalities . THIRD VOICE Carolina votes nay . I move to strike out the clause condemning the slave traffic . It has no place here . Georgia and Carolina object . FOURTH VOICE Motion to strike out clause condemning the slave traffic . Hands ! For ? JEFFERSON looks about , dismayed , counting the votes.Against ? JEFFERSON raises his hand.Motion carried . You will please strike out that clause . JEFFERSON bitterly scratches out the offending clause . p. 10 GEORGE READ That second sentence . Do n't like it . THOMAS JEFFERSON But this is the heart of it , man . Are we going to have to creep up on liberty , inch by inch ? VOICE Where does this lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property into the arms of the loyalists . THOMAS JEFFERSON I was asked to write the declaration and I wrote it . I have n't tried to be original . This is a simple expression of the American mind . Our people want this . GEORGE READ From a legalistic viewpoint THOMAS JEFFERSON The men who migrated to America , who built it with their sweat and blood , were laborers , not lawyers . GEORGE READ Plague o n't , boy ! You want some precedent . Where can you show me anything like this in history ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Where in history do we see anything like this new world or the man of this new world ? Where have we ever seen a land so marked by destiny to build a new free society based on the rights of man ? Precedent ? Let 's make precedent ! Better to set a good example than follow a bad one .

But , by the God that made me , I would have sooner ceased to exist than yield my freedom . And , in this , I know I speak for America . I am sorry to find a bloody campaign is decided on . But , since it is forced on us , we must drub the enemy and drub him soundly . We must teach the sceptered tyrant we are not brutes to kiss the hand that scourges us . But this is not enough . We are now deciding everlastingly our future and the future of our innocent posterity . Our people have already been fighting a year  --  for what ? He picks up the document.For this . Let us give it to them  --  in writing  --  now . Now is the time to buttress the liberty we 're fighting for . It ca n't be too strongly emphasized ! Now , while men are bleeding and dying . Tomorrow they may grow tired and careless , and a new despot may find in the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the time to build a free society . Now ! Not later .

My wife is ill and bearing me a child , and while I stay here she 's doing all my work at home . I 'm half mad with anxiety , but I 'll stay on all summer , if necessary , to fight for this one sentence . Pause . p. 12 GEORGE READ Well  --  er  --  Read it again . Let 's examine it again ! THOMAS JEFFERSON sits . Reads from the document , his voice rich with deep emotion:We hold these truths to be self-evident : that all men are created equal ; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights ; that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness ; that to secure these rights , governments are instituted among men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JEFFERSON 'S face is transfigured by an almost sacred light , which grows brighter , then fades and vanishes . Total darkness obscures even the shadowy ship and the dreaming silhouette of JEFFERSON . In the darkness the Liberty Bell peals louder and louder , then fades off  --  Soft , sweet , ghostly music The image of MARTHA appears , smiling sadly . The dreamer on the ship becomes visible again . He reaches out his hand . THOMAS JEFFERSON murmurs:Forgive me , Martha ! It was such a price to ask of you . Forgive me ! I wanted a happy world  --  for us ; and , reaching for it , I lost you . The ghost of MARTHA smiles sadly and shakes her head.Oh , my darling , in every picture I ever painted of the future you were the foreground . Without you , there 's no picture . There 's PATSY RANDOLPH off : p. 13 Father ! The ghost of MARTHA reaches out her hand , then fades and vanishes . PATSY appears . PATSY RANDOLPH Father ! The light comes on slowly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , Father . THOMAS JEFFERSON Hm ? PATSY RANDOLPH She 's sound asleep  --  Maria . THOMAS JEFFERSON Oh ! Good . Did she kick off the blanket ? PATSY RANDOLPH Yes , but I tucked her in again . Tight . THOMAS JEFFERSON Good . PATSY RANDOLPH You were so deep in meditation . What were you thinking ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Oh  --  nothing , dear . Just thinking . From above , the watch suddenly cries out , " Land ho ! " The cry is repeated below . From above , " Two points to the starboard ! Land ho ! " PATSY RANDOLPH Father ! There it is ! Do you see ? THOMAS JEFFERSON No . Where , Patsy ? Where ? PATSY RANDOLPH That light ! There ! THOMAS JEFFERSON peering off , his face working with emotion : @x New York , Spring 1790 . The MacComb mansion on lower Broadway , the presidential residence . PRESIDENT WASHINGTON , tight-lipped and grave , is listening to scholarly , prematurely wizened JAMES MADISON and ALEXANDER HAMILTON , a short , handsome , young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , foppish and affected , stands by , his face a mirror reflecting Hamilton 's lightning changes of mood . JAMES MADISON vehemently:If Colonel Hamilton 's treasury bill is reintroduced , Congress will kill it again . ALEXANDER HAMILTON drily:Mr . Madison , I am tempted to seize your Congress by their separate heads and knock them together into a collective jelly . JAMES MADISON What would that achieve ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON Unity ! Of some kind . JAMES MADISON Yes , but what kind ? That 's the question . ALEXANDER HAMILTON You cry , " Speculation ! " That 's not the issue at all , and you know it . JAMES MADISON I know nothing of the sort . On the contrary . ALEXANDER HAMILTON You deny your South is afraid the North will profit a little more ? p. 15 JAMES MADISON And will they ? Will they ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON That 's beside the point . Yes , they will . What of it ? He turns to WASHINGTON , pleading.The crying need of this infant government now is confidence in its financial policy . JAMES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON Question ? Can the wise and learned congressman from Virginia propose any better plan ? JAMES MADISON Colonel Hamilton ! Personalities are not the GEORGE WASHINGTON Gentlemen ! Gentlemen ! Thank you , Mr. Madison , for your views . Of course it is not in this office to interfere with the people 's legislature . JAMES MADISON Thank you ! ALEXANDER HAMILTON But , Mr. President ! You GEORGE WASHINGTON Congress must decide the merits of your bill . JAMES MADISON Good day , Mr. President . Bows to HAMILTON , who is almost bursting with fury.Colonel Hamilton . ALEXANDER HAMILTON My congratulations ! You 've won a noble victory over unity and honor . MADISON smiles , shakes his head , goes . HAMILTON turns to WASHINGTON.I warn you , sir p. 16 GEORGE WASHINGTON Slow , Colonel . Slow but sure . That must be our political maxim . ALEXANDER HAMILTON I 'm afraid I may have to resign . GEORGE WASHINGTON Now , my boy ! ALEXANDER HAMILTON I ca n't build a treasury out of thin air . GEORGE WASHINGTON I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some papers.Check these figures for me . He ruffles some other documents.These we 'll go over this evening . Mrs. Washington is expecting you and your lady . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Mrs. Hamilton is confined to bed . GEORGE WASHINGTON She is ? Anything wrong ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON On the contrary . GEORGE WASHINGTON Another ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON On the way . GEORGE WASHINGTON By God ! You little men ! My congratulations . ALEXANDER HAMILTON laughs:Thank you , sir . I 'll check these , now . Is there anything else ? GEORGE WASHINGTON No . HAMILTON turns to go . A SERGEANT enters . p. 17 SERGEANT His Excellency 's Ambassador to the Court of France , Mr. Jefferson ! GEORGE WASHINGTON Oh ! Good ! Show him in . SERGEANT Yes , sir . SERGEANT exits . HAMILTON wheels around . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Mr. Jefferson in New York ? COLONEL DAVID HUMPHREYS He arrived last night . HAMILTON glares at him . HUMPHREYS whines.I thought you knew , Alec . I ALEXANDER HAMILTON suddenly very excited , to the president:Providence is with us . Mr. Jefferson could easily persuade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never met him , so if you 'd speak to him GEORGE WASHINGTON I ca n't do that . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Why not ? GEORGE WASHINGTON groans:Again ? Must we go over the ground again , and again , and again , and again , and again ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON It seems nothing but a catastrophe will make any impression . Sweetly . But I am optimistic . I expect very shortly we will see a colossal catastrophe . He smiles ironically , bows , and goes . COLONEL HUMPHREYS follows . WASHINGTON stares after him , a shadow of a smile on his grim face . JEFFERSON enters . p. 18 THOMAS JEFFERSON General Washington ! GEORGE WASHINGTON rises:Mr . Jefferson ! Welcome home . Let me look at you . The two men study each other.Six years ! THOMAS JEFFERSON Six . A long time . GEORGE WASHINGTON sighs:Yes . How was Patsy 's wedding ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Beautiful . He hands WASHINGTON some parcels.For Mrs. Washington . For you . GEORGE WASHINGTON Oh ! You should n't have . Goes to his desk , picks up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . COLONEL DAVID HUMPHREYS entering:Jefferson , mon vieux ! THOMAS JEFFERSON David Humphreys ! How are you ? COLONEL DAVID HUMPHREYS Assez bien ! Assez bien ! Et notre charmante Paris ? Comment va-t-elle ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Changed . Everybody in Paris now talks politics . And you know how the French love to talk . COLONEL DAVID HUMPHREYS Ha ! Laughs  --  a high , affected cackle . Et la chre reine ? Et le roi ? How are they ? Daintily pinches some snuff into his nostrils . p. 19 THOMAS JEFFERSON The king hunts one half the day , drinks the other half . COLONEL DAVID HUMPHREYS slyly:La ! La ! THOMAS JEFFERSON The queen weeps , but sins on . COLONEL DAVID HUMPHREYS Ho , ho ! Mechante GEORGE WASHINGTON opens his package , takes out some lily bulbs:By God ! Lily bulbs ! THOMAS JEFFERSON The loveliest species I 've ever seen . Magnificent flower . Found them in the south of France . GEORGE WASHINGTON And rice seed . THOMAS JEFFERSON Italy ! GEORGE WASHINGTON Beautiful grain . THOMAS JEFFERSON Look at the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moves a chair for him . THOMAS JEFFERSON Thank you . Sits . GEORGE WASHINGTON crosses to a cabinet , takes out decanter and glasses , pours wine:And you found Virginia ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Ah ! p. 20 GEORGE WASHINGTON Mm ! THOMAS JEFFERSON Yes ! GEORGE WASHINGTON Crops ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Rye 's splendid . Wheat 's good . It 's going to be an excellent harvest . GEORGE WASHINGTON sighs:So I hear . THOMAS JEFFERSON Of course , my own lands are almost ruined . GEORGE WASHINGTON These damnable overseers ! Ignorant . Careless . Hands him a glass of wine . THOMAS JEFFERSON Mine complained the rabbits always ate the outside row of cabbages . GEORGE WASHINGTON Humph ! What 'd you tell him ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Told him to remove the outside row . GEORGE WASHINGTON laughs:Good ! He draws up a chair and sits close to JEFFERSON . COLONEL DAVID HUMPHREYS Your Excellency , I believe you have an appointment . GEORGE WASHINGTON dismisses HUMPHREYS with a gesture:All right , Colonel Humphreys , later . p. 21 COLONEL DAVID HUMPHREYS Monsieur l'Ambassadeur ! Your Excellency ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JEFFERSON stares after HUMPHREYS , amused:Tell me , do n't the little boys in the street run after him ? WASHINGTON looks after HUMPHREYS , turns to JEFFERSON , nods gravely . JEFFERSON laughs . They raise their glasses . GEORGE WASHINGTON The Republic ! They drink . JEFFERSON sips the wine appreciatively , holds it up to examine the color.Recognize it ? JEFFERSON nods.Excellent Madeira ! THOMAS JEFFERSON Patsy and I shopped all over Paris for it . GEORGE WASHINGTON Mr. Adams is very pleased with the wines you sent him . But  --  er  --  He looks gravely at JEFFERSON.His daughter is disappointed in the purchase you made for her . THOMAS JEFFERSON Mrs. Smith ? Now , what did she ? The Paris corset ? WASHINGTON nods.It did n't fit ? GEORGE WASHINGTON No ! He gestures with his hands , indicating the outlines of an ample bosom . p. 22 THOMAS JEFFERSON Oh , what a tragedy ! GEORGE WASHINGTON It 's very pretty , too . Mrs. Adams showed it to Mrs. Washington . Pink ribbons . The ladies are heartbroken . THOMAS JEFFERSON They must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After all , there are ebbs as well as flows in this world . When the mountain did n't go to Mohamet , Mohamet went to the mountain . GEORGE WASHINGTON smiles , drains his glass , puts it on the sideboard:So Lafayette is trying to establish a republic in France ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Slowly , by constitutional reform . In my rooms in Paris he drew up the first bill of rights for France . The people are all looking to our experiment . It 's a heart-warming thought that , in working out the pattern of our own happiness , we are inadvertently working for oppressed people everywhere . There 's a great danger there , though . I toured France , incognito . Visited the peasants in their hovels . The poverty and ignorance ! Appalling ! If they should ever lose Lafayette Shakes his head , finishes his drink . GEORGE WASHINGTON Anarchy ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Yes . GEORGE WASHINGTON sighs heavily:Yes. p. 23 THOMAS JEFFERSON studying him:Mr . President , you look tired . GEORGE WASHINGTON rising:I 'm not accustomed to this indoor life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best exercise . GEORGE WASHINGTON It 's not permitted . The dignity of the State forbids it , I 'm told . When we lived on Cherry Street , I could n't go down the street without a parade . But I can tell you since we moved here to Broadway , it 's a Godsend . Now , occasionally , I can steal out that door to the back yard , across the meadow , and down to the river . THOMAS JEFFERSON What do you do down at the river ? GEORGE WASHINGTON Go fishing . THOMAS JEFFERSON Ah ! GEORGE WASHINGTON rises , fetches a dish of biscuits:I 've had two attacks of illness this year . I doubt if I 'd survive a third . Oh , well , tomorrow or twenty years from now , we are all in the hands of a Good Providence . Try one of these biscuits . THOMAS JEFFERSON Thank you . GEORGE WASHINGTON goes to his desk:I 'm organizing the ministers of the various departments into a cabinet to advise me . As our secretary of state , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? THOMAS JEFFERSON In your letter you did give me the option of refusal . GEORGE WASHINGTON You ca n't mean to refuse ? THOMAS JEFFERSON I must . GEORGE WASHINGTON Why ? THOMAS JEFFERSON I 've been away so long . I know none of the duties of this office . I may bungle it . I have forebodings . GEORGE WASHINGTON We 're all groping . This will be a government of accommodation . THOMAS JEFFERSON shakes his head: I 'm sorry . I want you to understand . Whatever spice of political ambition I may have had as a young man has long since evaporated . He rises , places the half-nibbled biscuit on a dish.I believe every man should serve his turn . I think I 've done my share . Now I want to go home . I must complete my house . Twenty years it 's waited . Patsy and her husband have come to stay with me at Monticello . The truth of the matter is , I 've lived with my children so long , I 've come to depend on their affection and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of marrying again ? p. 25 THOMAS JEFFERSON No . GEORGE WASHINGTON She was a wonderful woman , your Martha . THOMAS JEFFERSON Yes . Pause.When I came home  --  she was in every room . Pause.I 've learned one thing . For me there 's no peace anywhere else in the world but Monticello . You understand why I must refuse your offer ? HUMPHREYS enters . COLONEL DAVID HUMPHREYS Excuse me , Sire . GEORGE WASHINGTON Yes , Humphreys ? COLONEL DAVID HUMPHREYS The theatre box and the guard of honor are arranged . GEORGE WASHINGTON drily:Good . COLONEL DAVID HUMPHREYS And I 've discovered the ambassador of the sultan of Turkey is going to be present . GEORGE WASHINGTON with a notable lack of enthusiasm:Mm , mm . COLONEL DAVID HUMPHREYS A suggestion , Excellency ? GEORGE WASHINGTON Yes ? COLONEL DAVID HUMPHREYS Would n't it be advisable to return to six horses on the coach ? p. 26 GEORGE WASHINGTON I thought we compromised on four . COLONEL DAVID HUMPHREYS When I was at the court of Louis GEORGE WASHINGTON slowly , making a great effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these forms to the dignity of a state , particularly one so young as ours . Understand , I know nothing of these matters . I 've never been to the courts of Europe . I 'm just an old soldier . I leave the ceremonies in your hands . The impatience wears thin and he growls.But it seems to me four horses and that canary coach with the pink and gilt angels will be enough to impress even the ambassador of the sultan of Turkey . COLONEL DAVID HUMPHREYS But , Sire GEORGE WASHINGTON Four will do  --  that 's final . He ruffles some papers , frowns.On second thought , I wo n't be free to go to the theatre tonight . Cancel it ! COLONEL DAVID HUMPHREYS Sire , if I may GEORGE WASHINGTON rises , thundering:Do n't " sire " me ! How many times must I tell you ? By the Eternal ! I am not a king ! I am the elected head of our people . This is a republic . Can you get that through your skull ? He controls himself . Wearily.All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , Mr. President . He goes . WASHINGTON sighs heavily . GEORGE WASHINGTON I was offered the crown . THOMAS JEFFERSON The crown ! GEORGE WASHINGTON Twice . Pause.I do n't want to be a king , Tom . He crosses to the cabinet , takes up a pipe , fills it with tobacco from a jug . THOMAS JEFFERSON I know you do n't , Mr. President . GEORGE WASHINGTON You 've no idea . He touches a taper to the flame of a burning candle.Every eye is on this office . A number of our people suspect me . As God is my judge , I would rather live and die on my farm than be emperor of the world . He lights his pipe , puffing angrily . THOMAS JEFFERSON pause:I know . And yet  --  since I 've been back  --  particularly here in New York  --  I find alarming yearnings . Our fashionable folk appear to be looking wishfully for a king and a court of our own . GEORGE WASHINGTON Yes . I suppose so . He sighs , exhales a huge puff of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the equal danger of anarchy . We came close to it while you were away ! He puffs nervously at his pipe.We walk between those two pitfalls . Our people do n't take to discipline . But , without it  --  we shall be lost . We 've yet to see how large a dose of freedom men can be trusted with . Tom , from the earliest days in Virginia , you were close to them , you seemed always to understand them . In this office I find myself far removed from direct contact with them . I need your agency . I need their faith in you . This is the last great experiment for promoting human happiness . I need the hand that wrote , " All men are created equal . " I ca n't let you go home yet ! I need you here . A long pause . JEFFERSON turns to the desk , pours back the rice seed he has been fondling , turns to WASHINGTON . p. 28 THOMAS JEFFERSON It 's for you to marshal us as you see fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! THOMAS JEFFERSON It 's a great honor . I hope I can be worthy of it . HUMPHREYS enters . COLONEL DAVID HUMPHREYS Mr. President ? GEORGE WASHINGTON I do n't wish to be disturbed . COLONEL DAVID HUMPHREYS His Excellency , the minister of the king of Spain is arrived to pay his respects . It had already been arranged , sir . Just the courtesies ! GEORGE WASHINGTON All right . Sighs . Beckons to the reception room.I 'll see him . To JEFFERSON.You 'll excuse me ? It will be a few minutes . There are some journals . THOMAS JEFFERSON holds up his portfolio:I have my tariff reports to study . WASHINGTON , escorted by HUMPHREYS , goes up corridor . HAMILTON drifts into the room , some papers in his hand . The two men look at each other . ALEXANDER HAMILTON You 're Jefferson ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Yes . p. 29 ALEXANDER HAMILTON I 'm Hamilton . THOMAS JEFFERSON The Hamilton ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON bows:Alexander . THOMAS JEFFERSON Your servant . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Yours . THOMAS JEFFERSON I read your Federalist papers while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal of pleasure .

THOMAS JEFFERSON Yes . ALEXANDER HAMILTON My congratulations . We must work in concert . THOMAS JEFFERSON I 'm such a stranger here , I shall lean on you . p. 30 ALEXANDER HAMILTON No , I 'm afraid  --  it 's  --  I who need your help . Suddenly agitated , emotional.Mr . Jefferson , it 's enough to make any man who loves America want to cry . Forgive me ! I really should n't burden you with this . It 's a matter of my own department . THOMAS JEFFERSON If I can be of any assistance ?

An interesting thought , Mr. Jefferson . THOMAS JEFFERSON God , yes . We live in an era perhaps the most important in all history . ALEXANDER HAMILTON An interesting thought ! An awful thought ! For , if it is true , then we dare not fail . THOMAS JEFFERSON No . ALEXANDER HAMILTON But we are failing . The machinery is already breaking down . He snaps his fingers.We have n't that much foreign credit . The paper money issued by the States is worthless . We are in financial chaos . He paces to and fro.The galling part is I have a remedy at hand . The solution is so simple . A nation 's credit , like a merchant 's , depends on paying its promissory notes in full . I propose to pay a hundred cents on the dollar for all the paper money issued by the States . Our credit would be restored instantaneously. p. 31 THOMAS JEFFERSON worried:Mr . Madison spoke to me very briefly of your bill last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper , and he fears ALEXANDER HAMILTON Madison ! I loved that man . I thought so high of that man . I swear I would n't have taken this office  --  except I counted on his support . And now , he 's turned against me . THOMAS JEFFERSON Mr. Madison has a good opinion of your talents . But this speculation ALEXANDER HAMILTON I do n't want his good opinion . I want his support . Will you use your influence ? THOMAS JEFFERSON You understand I 've been away six years . I 've gotten out of touch here . I 'll need time to study the facts . ALEXANDER HAMILTON There is no time . THOMAS JEFFERSON Well , three or four weeks . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Three or four ? For God 's sake , man , ca n't you understand what I 'm trying to tell you ? The North is about to secede ! THOMAS JEFFERSON Secede ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON Has n't the president told you ?

A long pause.However , it seems to me  --  if the Union is at stake  --  reasonable men sitting about a table discussing this coolly should arrive at some compromise . He comes to a sudden decision.Have dinner with me tomorrow night ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON Delighted . THOMAS JEFFERSON I 'll invite a friend or two . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Mr. Madison ? THOMAS JEFFERSON I ca n't promise anything . He 's bitterly opposed to your plan . ALEXANDER HAMILTON I have a way to sweeten the pill . The cost of living in New York has become so unreasonable there 's talk of moving the capital . THOMAS JEFFERSON Yes . ALEXANDER HAMILTON It 's already been promised temporarily to Philadelphia . Give me my bill and I can promise Madison the nation 's capital will go to the South . Permanently . I was born in the West Indies  --  I have no local preference .

ALEXANDER HAMILTON laughs:Fair enough . THOMAS JEFFERSON takes out his fan-shaped notebook , jots down the appointment:You see , Colonel Hamilton , we must never permit ourselves to despair of the republic .

GEORGE WASHINGTON looks at JEFFERSON , goes to a closet , takes out two fishing poles:How 'd you know ? Hands one to JEFFERSON.You do n't mind , now ?

For almost seven years . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Tch ! Too bad . They should have had more faith in their government . THOMAS JEFFERSON They had no way of knowing the bill was about to redeem that paper . I 'm very disturbed by this . ALEXANDER HAMILTON You are ? p. 46 THOMAS JEFFERSON Very . Apparently , a handful of speculators , many of them in high places , have taken advantage of their knowledge of the bill to feather their own nests . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Oh , now ! Do n't paint it worse than it is . THOMAS JEFFERSON There 's a good deal of bitter talk . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Idle gossip ! THOMAS JEFFERSON Hardly . ALEXANDER HAMILTON The treasury ca n't ask every man who submits a paper note how he came by it . At least in this way these people received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avert this speculation . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Look here  --  I do n't quite understand your attitude . Burst of laughter , offstage.If we want to develop this country we 've got to create great personal fortunes . Those men out there are building manufactories and industry . They 're building America ! THOMAS JEFFERSON Good . Let 's encourage them ! But not at the expense of the people ! ALEXANDER HAMILTON You and Madison ! The people whisper  --  you tremble . MONROE and MADISON enter , stand silently listening . p. 47 THOMAS JEFFERSON That 's as it should be , is n't it ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON I am determined this country 's happiness shall be established on a firm basis . I think its only hope now lies in a moneyed aristocracy to protect it from the indiscretions of the people . THOMAS JEFFERSON I see . And this bill is to lay the foundation for such an aristocracy ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON Exactly . THOMAS JEFFERSON I was n't aware of that . You said nothing of that to me . I must be quite honest with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party to your bill . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Made ? Made , you say ? You 've been in politics twenty-one years . Do n't play the innocent with me ! Are you dissatisfied with your bargain ? Is that it ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Bargain ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON The capital of the nation is going to yourstate  --  not mine . THOMAS JEFFERSON Oh , for God 's sake ! ALEXANDER HAMILTON Frankly , these alarms smell of hypocrisy . One minute you say you know nothing of Treasury matters ; the next you set yourself up as an authority . JAMES MONROE What do you propose , Colonel ? Shall we scrap the Constitution at once ? p. 48 ALEXANDER HAMILTON turns , sees MONROE and MADISON , murmurs , in disgust:The Constitution ! THOMAS JEFFERSON You supported it . ALEXANDER HAMILTON flaring:I had no choice . I could n't stand by and see the country go down in convulsions and anarchy . Pause . He controls himself.I must confess it 's my opinion this government wo n't last five years . However , since we 've undertaken this experiment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be certain of this : while it lasts it will be an aristocratic republic . If any man wants a democracy , let him proceed to the confines of some other government . Good day , gentlemen . He goes . THOMAS JEFFERSON to MONROE:My apologies . I was wrong . To MADISON.Forgive me , Jemmy . I should n't have asked you to compromise . JAMES MADISON Tom , we ca n't escape it . He 's trying to administer the Constitution into something it was never intended to be . JAMES MONROE I have a statement from a man who swears that Hamilton gave him money out of the public treasury to speculate with . THOMAS JEFFERSON That I do n't believe . p. 49 JAMES MONROE There are also some letters in Hamilton 's hand . THOMAS JEFFERSON Do n't believe it ! He 's personally honest . I 'll vouch for that . JAMES MONROE Will you at least confront him with these letters ? Ask him to explain them ? THOMAS JEFFERSON I ca n't . JAMES MONROE Why not ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight fire with fire . THOMAS JEFFERSON I 'm no salamander . Fire 's not my element . JAMES MONROE His bill has made the fortunes of half the prominent men in the Federalist Party . It 's a ring he 's put through their nose . And it 's clear enough , God knows , where he intends to lead them . You ca n't allow that . You 've got to fight him . You 've got to wrest the leadership of the Federalist Party away from him ! THOMAS JEFFERSON a surge of revulsion:If there 's one thing makes me sick to death  --  it 's the whole spirit of party politics . James , if the only way I could enter heaven was on the back of a political party , I 'd rather burn in purgatory . Jacob appears in the doorway , adjusting saddle . p. 50 JACOB Your horse is ready , Mr. Jefferson . THOMAS JEFFERSON looks at him , pauses:Oh , thank you , Jacob . JACOB Ready your horses , gentlemen ? JAMES MADISON Yes , please . Jacob exits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifeless:You 're wrong about the letters , James . For the rest , his bill has values . But it 's hurt our people . Through it , he 's created a corrupt squadron . Naturally , if he does try to pervert the Constitution , I shall oppose him . But I must do it in my own way . I 'm not a brawler ; I 'm not a politician . Crosses to MADISON.Say howdya to all my neighbors for me . MADISON nods.The matter I spoke to you of ? Hands a paper to MADISON . JAMES MADISON nods:I 'll tend to this first thing on my arrival . THOMAS JEFFERSON Thanks , Jemmy . JAMES MADISON I know how important it is to you . THOMAS JEFFERSON Very . Pleasant journey , Jemmy . Hurry back . To MONROE , gently.A game of chess tonight ? MONROE nods . JEFFERSON goes . p. 51 JAMES MONROE looking after him:Blast it ! This is n't the Jefferson we knew . JAMES MADISON No . JAMES MONROE The country 's red-hot . It 's being shaped , now . What does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears Christ wept before the tomb of Lazarus . JAMES MONROE You talk of Tom as if he were dead . JAMES MADISON holds up the paper JEFFERSON gave him:He asked me to order a new stone for Martha 's grave . Unfolds paper.Do you understand Greek ? JAMES MONROE No . Translate it ! JAMES MADISON translates:Roughly " If in the shades below , The fires of friends and lovers cease to glow , Yet mine , mine aloneWill burn on through death , itself . " JAMES MONROE After nine years ? JAMES MADISON After nine years ! JACOB and MAT enter , go to hearth . JACOB Horses ready ! JAMES MONROE Thank you , Jacob . NED enters . MADISON and MONROE exit . p. 52 NED raging as he tears off his apron:I 'll be damned if I 'll serve on them any more ! Know what they 're saying now ? Dukes and lords we ought a have ! MAT Dukes and lords ? NED Ay ! The blood-suckin ' swindlers ! JACOB Pump her , Mat ! Pump her ! MAT What do they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is that what we fought Lexington and Bunker Hill for ? Is this the freedom my brother and my sister 's husband died for ? Where 's your goddamn revolution now ? JACOB between his teeth , grimly:Pump her , Mat ! Come on , pump her ! MAT pumps . The forge glows , highlighting the taut and angry faces . JACOB hammers the hot iron with mighty , ringing blows. @x Hamilton 's home . Candlelight . HAMILTON , HUMPHREYS , and KNOX are having coffee . MRS . HAMILTON is pouring coffee . HAMILTON is opening a package of cigars . MRS . HAMILTON seated on sofa:When I think of Louis and Marie in jail ! COLONEL DAVID HUMPHREYS I have n't slept a wink since the palace fell . Dreadful ! Did you read Fenno 's piece in the Gazette today ? MRS . HAMILTON I never miss Fenno . Brilliant , was n't it ? COLONEL DAVID HUMPHREYS Un chef-d'oeuvre ! MRS . HAMILTON Veritable ! HENRY KNOX The situation seems to be growing worse , too . What do you think , Alec , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm particularly disturbed by the effect it may have on some of our inflammables . He places the cigars on a tray . COLONEL DAVID HUMPHREYS You certainly lashed Mr. Jefferson on that score ! Ma foi ! Gave it to him . But proper ! MRS . HAMILTON to KNOX:Sugar ? p. 54 HENRY KNOX Please . MRS . HAMILTON Mr. Jefferson is n't really one of these filthy Democrats ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON I 'm afraid so , my dear . MRS . HAMILTON Does he reallybelieve every man is as good as every other man ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON Even better . They laugh . HUMPHREYS applauds . MRS . HAMILTON Cream ? HENRY KNOX Please . ALEXANDER HAMILTON And our people seem so convinced of it . They ca n't wait to cut each other 's throats . Offers cigars to KNOX.Try one of these . HENRY KNOX Yes . You saw it so clearly during the war . In the army . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Army ? He offers cigars to HUMPHREYS.Colonel Humphreys ? COLONEL DAVID HUMPHREYS takes a cigar , examines it apprehensively:So this is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to table , sets down cigars , lights a taper:From the Spanish Islands . Army ? It was no army , it was a mob . Only one man held it together . He holds the lighted taper to KNOX 's cigar . p. 55 HENRY KNOX The Chief . Lights his cigar with huge puffs . ALEXANDER HAMILTON nods:Washington . Lights HUMPHREYS 'S cigar . HENRY KNOX examines his cigar:Very interesting leaf . COLONEL DAVID HUMPHREYS puffing away:Mm ! Good ! Good ! ALEXANDER HAMILTON to KNOX:I hope you like them , Henry . I 've ordered a packet for you . HENRY KNOX Why , thank you , Alec . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Not at all . Selects and lights a cigar for himself . HENRY KNOX Yes . The Chief made an army out of a rabble , all right . There 's no doubt of that . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Ah ! But to accomplish it , even he had to resort to the gallows and the lash . As with an army , so with a nation . You need one strong man . HENRY KNOX The Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes I lay awake nights wondering how we can ever hold this country together when he 's gone . p. 56 HENRY KNOX Personally , I think it 's his character alone that does it . I would n't give a penny for the Constitution without him . ALEXANDER HAMILTON sits:Well , it 's real value is as a stepping-stone . Purring over his cigar.Wonderful flavor ? HENRY KNOX Mm ! COLONEL DAVID HUMPHREYS wryly:A bit strongish . They laugh . He disposes of his cigar in tray beside chair.I agree with Alec . A monarchy would have been our best salvation . MRS . HAMILTON Only today I was talking to some of the ladies of our court on this subject . You go out in the streets . It 's frightening . We 're all agreed , the time is ripening for us to have a realking . BUTLER entering:Senator Monroe is calling , sir . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Monroe ? What 's he want ? Rises.Show him in .

Fought in almost every important battle of the war . ALEXANDER HAMILTON The soul of a clerk , though . I ca n't abide that . COLONEL DAVID HUMPHREYS He was , you know . He was a clerk in Jefferson 's law office ten years ago . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Still is , as far as I 'm concerned . They laugh.I 'll wager ten to one he 's here on some errand for Mr. Jefferson ! Mark ! You 'll see ! BUTLER enters . BUTLER Colonel Monroe . JAMES MONROE enters , bows:Gentlemen ! Colonel Hamilton . KNOX rises , bows briefly , and sits again . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Colonel Monroe . This is an unexpected pleasure . You 've met my lady . JAMES MONROE Mrs. Hamilton . He bows.I was reluctant to intrude on you in your home .

JAMES MONROE Did you give him this money ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON I did . But it was my own . JAMES MONROE And why did you give money to such a character ? A long pause . p. 62 ALEXANDER HAMILTON He was blackmailing me . MRS . HAMILTON Alec ! JAMES MONROE What for ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON A personal matter which has nothing to do with the Treasury . I 'll prove that to your full satisfaction . JAMES MONROE Under any circumstances , I shall ask for an accounting to Congress . ALEXANDER HAMILTON As a senator , that is your privilege . And I shall oblige you . I will invite all America to look into the window of my breast and judge the purity of my political motives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever touched .

Do I know her ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON No . It was a game they were playing together . She and her husband . He suddenly appeared one night , claimed I 'd ruined his life , and threatened to inform you , unless I gave him a thousand dollars . He 's been bleeding me dry ever since . Now , he 's gotten himself in jail , and wants me to use my influence to release him . I refused . This is his revenge . Contritely.Forgive me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . MRS .

HAMILTON suddenly rises , moves away:Then I wish to Heaven you had n't told me at all . ALEXANDER HAMILTON rises: I 'm forced to it , Betsy . Jefferson obviously wants to destroy my position as leader of the party . As long as these letters in his hands go unexplained  --  by insinuation , he could undermine belief in my honesty . I must be prepared to publish the facts , if necessary . He goes to her , takes her arm.Betsy p. 66 MRS . HAMILTON drawing arm away:Please , Alec ! ALEXANDER HAMILTON You understand , do n't you ? MRS . HAMILTON Oh , yes . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Believe me , I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icy blast:And slept with a harlot ! Do n't insult me , Alec ! You never loved me .

I married you for your wealth and your position ! Is that what you believe ? MRS . HAMILTON wearily:I do n't know what to believe . Butler enters . BUTLER Excuse me , sir .

He 's been encouraging our people to all sorts of wild illusions . Bill of rights ! Freedom ! Liberty ! License ! Anarchy ! This is the fruit of his disordered imagination . That man will stop at nothing to achieve chaos . But there 'll be no more of him here ! I promise you . I will see to it . Looks at BETSY 's handkerchief , smooths it , a note of savage heartbreak in his voice.There 's no longer any room in this country  --  in this world , for both me and that  --  fanatic ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ACT TWO : Scene 2 The wild strains of " a Ira . " As the music fades away , the harsh , discordant voices of a crowd chanting it are heard . Philadelphia . 1793 . Evening . A room in a house rented by JEFFERSON . A mist hangs outside the window . Under the window , on the table , a row of potted plants . On a large table in the center of the room , books and papers piled high ; a vise , some tools , a machine in process of construction . A kettle of water on a Franklin stove . The noise of the crowd in the street faintly heard . JEFFERSON enters , hat in hand . He goes to the window , looks out . The sound of the crowd fades . He strikes flint and tinder and lights an oil lamp . Its light only serves to reveal the cheerlessness of the room . He extracts a journal from his pocket , sits , studying it , frowning . JUPITER , his body servant , enters . A Negro with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mister Tom ! THOMAS JEFFERSON Good evening , Jupiter . JUPITER goes about lighting the lamps:You come in so quiet .

JUPITER But yuh got to tuck sumpin ' in yuh . THOMAS JEFFERSON Later , perhaps . With an exclamation of disgust , JEFFERSON rises , throws the newspaper on the chair . JUPITER looks up , surprised at this unusual outburst . JEFFERSON walks over to the potted plants , examines them . JUPITER picks up the newspaper , looks at it quizzically , places it on the table . JEFFERSON examines the potted plants , nips off a few dead leaves . JUPITER wheedles:Good supper . We got basted puddin' ' an ' chicken . THOMAS JEFFERSON shakes his head:Thanks . Picks up a little watering pot near by and waters the plants . JUPITER You just come fum one a dem cabinet meetin 's ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Nods knowingly.Funny weather outside . Sticky !

JEFFERSON notices JUPITER 's hand is roughly bandaged with a blood-stained handkerchief . p. 72 THOMAS JEFFERSON What 's happened to your hand ? JUPITER Oh , it 's nothin ' . THOMAS JEFFERSON Let me look at it ! Come here . He removes the bandage.A nasty gash . Sit over here ! JUPITER sits . JEFFERSON goes to the stove , pours some water into a cup , selects a bottle of wine and cruet of oil from the cupboard.How did you do that , Jupiter ? JUPITER When I do my marketin ' this afternoon , Mister Tom . JEFFERSON sets the cup , the wine and the oil on the table , opens a drawer , and takes out some cloth . He opens JUPITER 's hand , examines it . THOMAS JEFFERSON This is going to sting a bit . Tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mister Tom . THOMAS JEFFERSON dips the cloth in the water and starts to clean the wound . He soaks the cloth with wine , dabs the wound . JUPITER winces:Hurt you ? JUPITER stoically shakes his head.How did you do this ? JUPITER Down outside Bainbridge Market . Just as I came out . THOMAS JEFFERSON Yes ? p. 73 JUPITER Three men was talkin ' . " Mr. Jefferson 's a devil , " they say . Colonel Hamilton tell dem you gon na bring the French Revolution here . Murder everybody . I do n't like that . I told them that ai n't true . " Ai n't you Jefferson 's nigger ? " they say . They say they was gon na kill me . One of ' em tried to hit me on the head with a stick . I put my hand up . The stick had a nail in it .

THOMAS JEFFERSON A man of sense does n't dispute the road with such an animal . He walks around it . He smiles . JUPITER laughs and nods . JUPITER Yeah , I guess so .

THOMAS JEFFERSON The door-pull ! JUPITER goes to answer it . JEFFERSON picks up the wine , returns it to cupboard . JUPITER appears in the doorway , excited and laughing:Mister Tom ! Looka here ! Look who 's here . PATSY enters . PATSY RANDOLPH Father ! THOMAS JEFFERSON Patsy ? Darling . They rush to each other and embrace . PATSY RANDOLPH Oh , Father . It 's so good to see you . THOMAS JEFFERSON My dearest . What in the world ? PATSY RANDOLPH I wanted to surprise you . THOMAS JEFFERSON It 's a wonderful surprise . Jupiter , kill the fatted calf ! Two for supper .

He exits . THOMAS JEFFERSON How 's little Jeff , and my sweet Anne , and Maria ? And Mr. Randolph ? Here ! Give me your cloak . JEFFERSON takes her cloak , places it on a chair . p. 77 PATSY RANDOLPH Jeff has two new teeth . THOMAS JEFFERSON Two ? Wonderful ! PATSY RANDOLPH He 's beginning to talk . Anne 's growing so .

THOMAS JEFFERSON And how 's your good husband ? PATSY RANDOLPH Mr. Randolph 's well , working hard . Doing the best he can with the overseer .

She toys with a mechanical device on the table. What 's this ? Another " convenience " of yours ? THOMAS JEFFERSON That 's a copying machine . Very handy . It makes duplicate copies of letters . I 'll show you how it works . PATSY RANDOLPH laughs:Oh , Father . You and your inventions ! Sometimes I Her eye is caught by the journal on the table .

THOMAS JEFFERSON It 's very flattering . Especially that bit about the harem ! A harem ! At my age ! Pretty good . PATSY RANDOLPH I do n't see any humor in it ! You 'll answer these charges ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Answer one lie , they print twenty new ones . PATSY RANDOLPH Then what are you going to do ? p. 80 THOMAS JEFFERSON Let 's ignore it , dear , hm ? PATSY RANDOLPH Who wrote it ? Who 's Pacificus ? THOMAS JEFFERSON I do n't know . It 's a pseudonym . PATSY RANDOLPH pauses . She looks at him , almost in tears ; finally , very bitterly:You must enjoy being the secretary of state very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's my job , dear . PATSY RANDOLPH Job ? Rises , walks to the window , agitated.Father ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Yes , dear ? PATSY RANDOLPH Do n't you think you 've sacrificed enough ? THOMAS JEFFERSON I have n't sacrificed anything . PATSY RANDOLPH You have n't ? THOMAS JEFFERSON No . Pause . PATSY RANDOLPH A few weeks ago I found a pamphlet Mother had written during the Revolution to the Women of Virginia on the necessity for them  --  Bitterly .  --  to make sacrifices to help win the war . I remember Mother so ill she could hardly walk , doing ten men 's work at home . I remember , after she died , sitting on the cold floor outside your door , listening to you sob till I thought you , too , must die . I remember hearing you cry out you 'd sacrificed her to the Revolution . p. 81 THOMAS JEFFERSON sinks into a chair:Patsy PATSY RANDOLPH The morning and afternoon of your life you sacrificed . Was n't that enough ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Patsy , dear ! Please ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself , what of us ?

I tell you , Father , everything at home is going to pieces . If you do n't come back soon , there 'll be nothing left . Nothing ! THOMAS JEFFERSON rises , in agony:Patsy ! Will you , for God 's sake , stop ! PATSY RANDOLPH crosses to him , overcome with remorse:Father ! Oh , Father , I did n't mean to THOMAS JEFFERSON takes her in his arms:I know . I know . PATSY RANDOLPH Forgive me. p. 82 THOMAS JEFFERSON Of course . PATSY RANDOLPH I 've been so confused and unhappy . I had to come and talk it out with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been very hurt if you had n't . PATSY RANDOLPH It 's the business of running Monticello and the farms . We try ! Lord knows we try ! But Mr. Randolph has no talent for it . And his failure makes him irritable . And I worry so . I 'm afraid you may lose everything you own . THOMAS JEFFERSON I see , my dear . I see . He strokes her hair. I have n't been altogether insensible to this . It 's weighed on me very heavily , the trouble I put your good husband to . PATSY RANDOLPH I should n't have said anything . I know what your work here means to you . THOMAS JEFFERSON a sudden surge of bitterness:I have never loathed anything as much in my life . You 've no idea , Patsy , of the rank and malignant hatreds here . Politics destroys the happiness of every being in this city ! I 'm surrounded here by hate and lies . Lately I 've seen men who once called them-selves my friends go so far as to cross the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You , of all people ! Why ? p. 83 THOMAS JEFFERSON There are a gang of king-jobbers here who are bent on changing our principle of government  --  by force , if necessary . Since Mr. Madison and Mr. Monroe have left , I 'm alone against them . I ca n't contend with them , Patsy . PATSY RANDOLPH What of the president ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Only his strength and his stubborn purity oppose them . But he 's old , and he 's sick . Sits.I work from morning till night . They undo everything . This is n't spending one 's life here . It 's getting rid of it . PATSY RANDOLPH Oh , my poor father ! PATSY goes to him , kneels at his feet . He draws out a locket hanging around his neck . THOMAS JEFFERSON Do you know , dear , my only pleasure ? For an hour or so every evening I sit and dream of Monticello . I find myself more and more turning to the past and to those I loved first . Your mother He opens the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She loved you all so dearly . Closes the locket.You 're right , Patsy . If I had n't neglected my duties at home during the war , she would have been alive today . It 's true . I sacrificed your mother to the Revolution . And now I 'm doing the same to you . Darling , your happiness is more important to me than my life . And , like a fool , I 've been jeopardizing it . For the privilege of being  --  Rises , picks up the newspaper .  --  called in the public prints " lecher , liar , thief , hypocrite ! " He throws down the newspaper.But no more ! You must n't worry , dearest . Everything 's going to be all right . I promise you . I 'm tending to my own from now on . Grim-faced , he takes down a portable writing-desk from the mantelpiece , sits , places it on his lap , opens it , extracts paper and pen , and begins to write furiously.Patsy ! p. 84 PATSY RANDOLPH Yes . THOMAS JEFFERSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PATSY pulls the cord . A tinkle is heard , offstage.I have a job for you tomorrow . PATSY RANDOLPH Good . What is it ? THOMAS JEFFERSON as he writes:I want you to help me select what furniture and articles suit Monticello , and pack and ship them to Richmond . PATSY RANDOLPH To Richmond ? THOMAS JEFFERSON I 'll be busy here the next few weeks , but we 'd better get them off at once while the shipping lanes are still seaworthy . He sands the letter , blows it , reads it a moment . JUPITER enters . JUPITER Yes , Mister Tom ? THOMAS JEFFERSON You know where the president 's home is ? JUPITER Yes . THOMAS JEFFERSON Please deliver this letter there at once . JUPITER After supper ? THOMAS JEFFERSON rises:No , now , Jupiter . JUPITER My supper 's gon na get spoiled . p. 85 THOMAS JEFFERSON At once , Jupiter . To PATSY.We 're going home , together . To stay , Patsy . I 'm resigning . He places the open portable desk on the table . JUPITER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , Jupiter . Jupiter stares at JEFFERSON . JUPITER Mister Tom goin ' home ? PATSY RANDOLPH Oh ! I 'm so happy , Father , I The faint noise of a crowd outside . PATSY breaks off , listens . The noise grows . THOMAS JEFFERSON The crowd again . He crosses to the window and looks out.This is good fuel for the Federalists ! The chanting of the mob suddenly becomes loud and ominous . PATSY RANDOLPH What are they chanting ? THOMAS JEFFERSON I ca n't make it out . The chanted words : " Down with " become distinguishable . PATSY RANDOLPH Down with  --  who ? THOMAS JEFFERSON as the last word becomes clearly " Washington " : Washington ? Wash  --  ! He and PATSY look at each other . A moment of shocked silence.He 's all that stands between them and their enemies . Pause.Patsy ! When all our names are sponged from the records , his will burn brighter , wherever men fight for freedom . Irritably , to JUPITER who is standing there as if rooted to the spot.All right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? JUPITER goes . PATSY looks at JEFFERSON questioningly.No , darling . It is n't going to make any difference . If our people wo n't deserve their liberty , no one can save it for them . I 'm going home . He picks up the portable desk , slams it shut , and places it back on the mantel. p. 86 CURTAIN p. 87 Act 2 , Scene 3 ACT TWO : Scene 3 The same , a few days later . Most of the furnishings are now gone , leaving noticeably naked areas in the room . There are several bundles of books , etc. , on the floor . PATSY is wrapping pictures and the more fragile articles in several layers of cloth , and packing them carefully in a barrel . JEFFERSON , sitting at his desk , is writing furiously , disposing rapidly of a great mass of documents piled before him . Clouds of smoke hang over the room , fed by several braziers . JUPITER enters , his face sick with apprehension . He picks up a bundle of books , starts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is heard outside . PATSY , JEFFERSON , and JUPITER straighten up , listening . JUPITER De death cart ! He goes to the window.It 's piled full , Mister Tom . He crosses to the braziers.Dis yellow fever everywhere ! White folks droppin ' like flies , Mister Tom ! He pours some nitre into the braziers . Fresh ribbons of smoke spiral up . THOMAS JEFFERSON to PATSY:You hear that ? PATSY stubbornly continues her wrapping . JUPITER I never seen nuttin ' like dis . p. 88 THOMAS JEFFERSON Jupiter ! Take Mrs. Randolph at once to Germantown . PATSY RANDOLPH I sha n't go . The door-pull tinkles . JUPITER goes to answer it . THOMAS JEFFERSON Patsy ! I 'll pick you up there in a few days , and then we 'll go on home together . PATSY RANDOLPH I sha n't leave you here alone . THOMAS JEFFERSON I have work to finish . PATSY RANDOLPH Then I 'll stay , too . THOMAS JEFFERSON You 're a stubborn child . PATSY RANDOLPH I come by it honestly . Enter JUPITER and HAMILTON . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JEFFERSON rises:Colonel Hamilton . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Has the president arrived yet ? JUPITER exits . THOMAS JEFFERSON Not yet . My daughter , Mrs. Randolph . Colonel Hamilton . PATSY curtsies . HAMILTON bows . ALEXANDER HAMILTON He asked me to meet him here . I 'll wait in my carriage . p. 89 THOMAS JEFFERSON You 're welcome to sit here . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Thank you ! PATSY RANDOLPH Excuse me , Father ! Colonel Hamilton ! She curtsies , goes . ALEXANDER HAMILTON There 's a fellow lying on the sidewalk , dead of the plague . JEFFERSON goes to the window.Not a pleasant sight . I sent my driver to fetch the death cart . THOMAS JEFFERSON A bad business ! ALEXANDER HAMILTON Getting worse by the minute . Looks about.You moving ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Yes . You 'll have to pardon our appearance . Sits , picks up his pen.Excuse me ! I Indicates his work . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Quite all right . Please ! Do n't let me disturb you . JEFFERSON goes back to his writing . THOMAS JEFFERSON The president should have left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered him out . The great man 's a stubborn warrior , though . Ca n't budge him . Never could . JEFFERSON concentrates on his writing . HAMILTON glances at several magazines on a table near his chair , selects one with great surprise , glances toward JEFFERSON with uplifted brows , then , smiling mischievously : The Gazette ? JEFFERSON looks up from his work , searches HAMILTON with a cold glance , murmurs drily. p. 90 THOMAS JEFFERSON Yes . ALEXANDER HAMILTON I notice an article referring to you . Have you read it ? THOMAS JEFFERSON stops writing , looks up:I have . There is a pause . He goes back to his writing . ALEXANDER HAMILTON smiles , enjoying the game immensely:Well phrased . THOMAS JEFFERSON Brilliantly . And thoroughly untrue , Colonel Hamilton . Thoroughly . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Oh , come now , Mr. Jefferson  --  you do well with the ladies ? THOMAS JEFFERSON writes on:So I see in the Gazette . ALEXANDER HAMILTON When I read this article I THOMAS JEFFERSON Read it ? It 's commonly supposed , Mr. Hamilton , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some person called  --  Peers at journal mockingly.  --  Pa  --  ci  --  fi  --  cus . THOMAS JEFFERSON savoring the irony , smiles wryly:Pacificus . Peaceful ! A proper pen name . Colonel Hamilton , almost since our first cabinet meeting  --  you and I have been thrown at each other like cocks in a pit . The cockfight is over . " Peaceful " will soon have the cabinet to himself . p. 91 ALEXANDER HAMILTON How is that ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Has n't the president informed you ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON No . THOMAS JEFFERSON I 've resigned . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Oh ! I 'm sorry to hear that . THOMAS JEFFERSON I 'm not . I 'm very happy , Colonel . ALEXANDER HAMILTON rises , moves to window:In that event , I rejoice with you . THOMAS JEFFERSON Colonel Hamilton , you 're going to your home in the country , now , to wait out the plague ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON Yes . THOMAS JEFFERSON I , too , will be gone in a few days . We may never see each other again . Crosses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quite probably we wo n't . THOMAS JEFFERSON I should like to ask you as man to man , without rancor or warmth  --  He picks up the newspaper .  --  is this fitting to the dignity of a minister of state ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON bitterly:Was it fitting the dignity of your high office to send your henchmen prying into my private life ? p. 92 THOMAS JEFFERSON I never did that . ALEXANDER HAMILTON You thought I would keep silent , did you ? You thought sooner than risk my personal happiness I 'd let you call me thief ? Well ! You see what you 've done ? Congress has cleared my public name , and I 'm all the stronger for it ! I did n't run away ! However , in your case , I think it wise for you to go home and sit on your mountain-top . The philosophic experiment is over . Your Democracy is finished . THOMAS JEFFERSON You really think that ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON I know it . I knew it six years ago . The bellpull tinkles.My God , are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you think of your people now ? Your fellow dreamer , Lafayette , in irons , rotting in a German jail , his only refuge from the very ones he sought to free . At that , he 's lucky . If he had n't escaped in time , even now his head would be lying in the basket , his blood flowing in the gutters , running into a river of the noblest blood of France  --  for your drunken swine , the people , to swill in . I tell you  --  it nauseates me to the very heart . And now , the same rioting mobs here , and next , the same terror ! JUPITER enters:General Washington . GEORGE WASHINGTON enters:Gentlemen ! He is getting very old . His face is tired and bewildered , but a bulwark of grim , stubborn determination . JUPITER exits . p. 93 THOMAS JEFFERSON Mr. President . Moves to WASHINGTON ; takes his hat and stick . ALEXANDER HAMILTON No asafoetida pad ? Produces a spare pad and hands it to the president.In these times , Mr. President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beg of you ! GEORGE WASHINGTON Very well . Accepts pad.Thank you ! Sits down heavily , silent for a moment , as he broods , all the while tapping the arm of the chair as if it were a drum . The death cart outside rumbles by.More than two thousand dead already . This plague is worse than a hundred batteries of cannon . Sighs , taps . ALEXANDER HAMILTON You should have left the city immediately , sir . GEORGE WASHINGTON I think I almost prefer to be in my grave than in the present situation . Taps , sighs heavily . A long pause.What does it mean ? Silence ; taps.Incredible . Are n't men fit to be free ? Is that the answer ? Have you spoken to the French minister ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Yes . One ca n't reason with him . He 's a lunatic ! I 've demanded his recall . GEORGE WASHINGTON They 're all lunatics . Lafayette fleeing for his life ? Lafayette ? And here now , mobs rioting ! What does this mean ? Pause.We must do what we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despatched a letter to Ambassador Morris , urging him to make every solicitation in his power . GEORGE WASHINGTON I do n't know if it 'll help . I doubt it . WASHINGTON nervously picks up the Gazette , glances quickly at JEFFERSON . To HAMILTON , with a touch of sternness.Do you mind waiting below ? I should like to talk with you . ALEXANDER HAMILTON glances a bit guiltily at JEFFERSON , then smiles ironically:I 'll wait in your carriage . WASHINGTON nods.Your servant , Mr. Jefferson . THOMAS JEFFERSON Mr. Hamilton . HAMILTON goes . GEORGE WASHINGTON I shall have to speak to him again . He 's very difficult . He 's always been that way , though . Once , during the war , when he was my aide , he kept me waiting two hours . When I rebuked him , he resigned . Sulked like a little boy . Softens , with evident love of HAMILTON.Finally I gave him what he wanted  --  a command in the field . He was a very good soldier . Led his troops in the first assault on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you two work together ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Our principles are as separate as the poles . p. 95 GEORGE WASHINGTON Coalesce them ! THOMAS JEFFERSON It ca n't be done . GEORGE WASHINGTON Let me be the mediator . THOMAS JEFFERSON You 've tried before . GEORGE WASHINGTON Let me try again . THOMAS JEFFERSON It 's no use . Believe me . Neither of us could honestly sacrifice his belief to the other . GEORGE WASHINGTON sighs , taps:Well , I 'm ordered back home . Any messages to Albemarle County ? THOMAS JEFFERSON sits next to WASHINGTON:My best regards to Mr. Madison . And you might look at my new threshing machine . If it interests you , the millwright 's in Richmond now . He 'd be very happy for any new commissions . You get eight bushels of wheat an hour out of two horses . GEORGE WASHINGTON Hm ! I 'll certainly examine it . THOMAS JEFFERSON Tell Madison next spring we 'll be planting our gardens together . GEORGE WASHINGTON No , Tom . I 'm afraid you wo n't . THOMAS JEFFERSON Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lays it on desk:Your resignation . I ca n't accept it . p. 96 THOMAS JEFFERSON rises: I 'm sorry , Mr. President . You 'll have to . GEORGE WASHINGTON Where can I find anyone to replace you ? THOMAS JEFFERSON I do n't flatter myself on that score . I 've failed . GEORGE WASHINGTON Let me be the judge of that . THOMAS JEFFERSON I 've spent twenty-four years in public life . I 'm worn down with labors that I know are as fruitless to you as they are vexatious to me . My personal affairs have been abandoned too long . They are in utter chaos . I must turn to them and my family . GEORGE WASHINGTON And the good esteem of your fellow men ? THOMAS JEFFERSON moves away:There was a time when that was of higher value to me than anything in the world . Now I prefer tranquillity . Here , for everything I hate , you ask me to give up everything I love . I 'm sorry , no ! I want a little peace in my lifetime . GEORGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tom , and I 'm getting old , and I catch myself dreaming of the Potomac and Mount Vernon . He almost shouts.Do n't you think I hate this , too ? Do n't you think I yearn for the peace of my own farm ? Do n't you think all this  --  all this Controls himself . There is a long silence . He murmurs.Peace in our life ? Where ? His memories turn back as he searches for the phrase.Oh , yes . Paine wrote it . Was it in The Crisis ? " These are the times that try men 's souls . The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will , in this crisis , shrink " JEFFERSON sinks into a chair ; unwittingly , the president has dealt him a stunning blow.How that brings back the picture ! As if it were yesterday . My men starved , naked , bleeding . I read Paine 's essay . You know , it lent me new strength . I had it read to my men through trumpets . Nailed it on trees for them to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you remember the passage on the Tory innkeeper who was opposed to the war because  --  He finds the phrase he 's been searching for .  --  that 's it  --  " He wanted peace in his lifetime " ? And Paine looked down at the innkeeper 's children crawling on the floor and thought , " Were this Tory a man , he would say : If there must be conflict with tyranny , let it come in my time . Let there be peace and freedom in my children 's time . " Yes . That 's the answer , I suppose . The only answer . Suddenly , desperately , he grips JEFFERSON 'S arm.Tom ! The fabric is crumbling . Our Republic is dying . We must bolster it , somehow  --  some way . Fiercely , a grim , stubborn warrior fighting a ghost . He pounds the table.It must have a chance . It will , I say . It will , it will , it will ! I 'll defend its right to a chance with the last drop of my blood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick , old man.You 'll stay on a few days more ? Till I find someone else ? p. 97 THOMAS JEFFERSON Yes . GEORGE WASHINGTON Good ! You see , I 'm like a man about to be hanged . Even a few days ' reprieve makes me rejoice . Sighs heavily , starts to go , turns.I would n't stay here . Take your papers , go to the country . You can work there . Bows.Mr . Jefferson . THOMAS JEFFERSON rises:Mr . President . WASHINGTON goes . Outside , the death cart rumbles by . JEFFERSON , torn and tortured , drops back into his chair . JUPITER enters , pours more nitre into the braziers . PATSY enters , holding up a music box . PATSY RANDOLPH Father ! Look ! I found this little music box inside . May I Father ! You 're not ill ? THOMAS JEFFERSON No , Patsy .

PATSY RANDOLPH May I take this home to Anne ? p. 98 THOMAS JEFFERSON Yes , dear . She turns a knob . The music box plays a tinkling melody . PATSY RANDOLPH Anne will love it . Ca n't you just see her face ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Mm . Pause . PATSY RANDOLPH Did the president accept your resignation ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Yes . PATSY RANDOLPH I spoke to him in the hallway . He looks so old , does n't he ? JEFFERSON nods . PATSY shuts off the music box.Oh , Father , please ! Please do n't torment yourself so ! THOMAS JEFFERSON rising:He 's a dying man , Patsy . He 's dying . And , when he 's gone , they 'll take the reins . And that 'll be the end , Patsy . That 'll be the end of the Republic . PATSY RANDOLPH Perhaps we were n't ready for it , Father . THOMAS JEFFERSON moves about , restlessly:If not here and now , where , then ? Where will men ever have such a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my earliest youth . PATSY RANDOLPH You 've done your best , Father . THOMAS JEFFERSON Not good enough , apparently . Summer soldier . Pause.It was seventeen years ago , here in Philadelphia , I wrote the Declaration of Independence . That 's how I dreamed of America , Patsy . A beacon for all mankind . Pause.Patsy ! It 's not our people who 've failed us . It 's we who 've failed them . Yes . I see that now . Paces about the room.These fermentations are a healthy sign . Our people are groping . They 're jealous of their rights ? Good ! They want a larger share in their government . Most of them today have n't even the privilege of voting . It would take so little education to make them understand these disorders are not to their advantage . That 's where we 've failed them , Patsy . It 's not enough to create the form of a Republic . We must make it work . We must see that our people get the right to vote . We must educate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must give them free schools , and universities , and a liberal press . Only an enlightened people can really be free . Till now , the genius of the common people has been buried in the rubbish heap . We must rescue that ! I 'm convinced of it !

ALEXANDER HAMILTON I beg your pardon . I did n't mean to JEFFERSON faces HAMILTON . JUPITER exits . THOMAS JEFFERSON It 's quite all right . Come in ! ALEXANDER HAMILTON The president asked me to speak to you . He 's greatly distressed . THOMAS JEFFERSON Yes , I know he is . ALEXANDER HAMILTON He asked me to make an effort to coalesce our differences . There 's no reason why we should n't . THOMAS JEFFERSON You think we can ?

ALEXANDER HAMILTON You do n't flatter me ! THOMAS JEFFERSON It is not an American art . ALEXANDER HAMILTON I am an American by choice , not by accident . THOMAS JEFFERSON Yet you bring here a lie bred out of the vices and crimes of the old world . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Lie ? THOMAS JEFFERSON The lie that the masses of men are born with saddles on their backs , and a chosen few booted and spurred to ride them legitimately , by the grace of God . ALEXANDER HAMILTON It 's laughable ! You , born to wealth and land and slaves , driveling about the common people ! THOMAS JEFFERSON Search your own birth , Mr. Hamilton , and you 'll ALEXANDER HAMILTON Do n't say it ! Trembling with rage.I must warn you . THOMAS JEFFERSON Say what ?

ALEXANDER HAMILTON Why do you think I want the country strong ? p. 101 THOMAS JEFFERSON It can only be strong if its people govern it . ALEXANDER HAMILTON You think the peasants on my farm can make it strong ? THOMAS JEFFERSON There are no peasants in America . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Words ! What do I care for them ! Call them yeomen ! Call them what you will ! Men can not rule themselves . THOMAS JEFFERSON Can they then rule others ? Have we found angels in the forms of kings and dictators to rule them ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON I 've made my last gesture . Go ! Run back to your hill ! From here on , I promise you , you will never again dare raise your head in this party . THOMAS JEFFERSON I hate party . But if that 's the only way I can fight you  --  then I 'll create another party . I 'll create a people 's party . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Now it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flow ! At heart you , too , are a Jacobin murderer . THOMAS JEFFERSON That 's another lie you believe because you wish to believe it . It gives you the excuse you need to draw your sword ! I 'm sick to death of your silencing every liberal tongue by calling " Jacobin murderer . " ALEXANDER HAMILTON Well , are n't you ? Confess it ! p. 102 THOMAS JEFFERSON Go on ! Wave the raw head and the bloody bones ! Invent your scares and plots ! We were asleep after the first labors , and you tangled us and tied us , but we have only to awake and rise and snap off your Lilliputian cords . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Very well . Let it be a fight , then . But make it a good one . And , when you stir up the mobs , remember  --  we who really own America are quite prepared to take it back for ourselves , from your great beast , " The People . " THOMAS JEFFERSON And I tell you , when once our people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong as a giant . They will sooner allow the heart to be torn out of their bodies than their freedom to be wrested from them by a Caesar ! ALEXANDER HAMILTON bows:Good day , Mr. Jefferson . THOMAS JEFFERSON Good day , Colonel Hamilton . HAMILTON exits . THOMAS JEFFERSON turns to PATSY:Patsy , this is a fight that may take the rest of my life . PATSY RANDOLPH Yes . THOMAS JEFFERSON But I have to ! I hate it , but I have to , Patsy . I want Anne and Jeff and their children to grow up in a free republic . I have to , Patsy. p. 103 PATSY RANDOLPH Of course you do . Rises . Crosses to JEFFERSON.Of course you do , Father . She takes his hand impulsively , kisses it. @x The new city of Washington , 1801 .

CONRAD Stand to reason . She nods vigorously and scurries off , having said her piece . JAMES MADISON We should have foreseen this difficulty . We certainly bungled the electoral system . FRONTIERSMAN Constitution 's got ta be changed so a man can put down who he wants for president . THOMAS JEFFERSON Well , it can be amended . That 's the great virtue of the Constitution . It can grow . JAMES MADISON If we ever have the chance to amend it . I 'm worried sick by this , Tom .

But now the Federalists intend to drag everything down with them , rather than admit defeat . There is a knock at the door . PATSY RANDOLPH They 've turned President Adams completely against my father  --  one of his oldest friends ! GEORGE WASHINGTON LAFAYETTE This shocks me . I can not believe it . PATSY RANDOLPH Do you know why he did n't write your father all these years ? He could n't ! They opened his mail ! They twisted phrases he used in his letters , and printed them against him .

THOMAS JEFFERSON What can I do for you , General Hamilton ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON Nothing ! But I can do something for you . I 'm not going to equivocate , Mr. Jefferson . My sentiments toward you are unchanged . I still despise you and everything you represent . THOMAS JEFFERSON moves to desk . Indicates a chair:Chair , General ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON Is that understood ? THOMAS JEFFERSON I think pretty widely . Points to chair.Chair ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON sits:Thank you . Pause . They survey each other.You 've grown leaner . THOMAS JEFFERSON And you stouter . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Not at all . It 's this waistcoat . A few pounds , perhaps . Pause . HAMILTON glances out the window.So this is your city of Washington . A mud hole ! THOMAS JEFFERSON A few trees and some sidewalks and it will do . p. 120 ALEXANDER HAMILTON The first day we met this was born . THOMAS JEFFERSON Yes . ALEXANDER HAMILTON You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The presidential mansion appears not bad . THOMAS JEFFERSON Not bad . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Large enough . THOMAS JEFFERSON Large enough for two emperors and a rajah . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Who 's it to be  --  Aaron Burr or you ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Congress will decide . ALEXANDER HAMILTON rises: I have some friends in that body . I can influence this decision for or against you , I believe . THOMAS JEFFERSON I 'm certain of that . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Certain ? I 'm not . You 'd be astonished , Mr. Jefferson , at the number of gentlemen who , no matter what I counsel , would vote for the devil himself in preference to you . THOMAS JEFFERSON Yes . That 's quite probable . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Not that I approve of it . I do n't . I deplore it . In the matter of the public good , men must consult their reason , not their passions . I believe I can swing Congress over to you , if you accede to certain conditions . p. 121 THOMAS JEFFERSON I see .

THOMAS JEFFERSON No need to shout , General . ALEXANDER HAMILTON pacing furiously:I 'll raise the roof if I please . THOMAS JEFFERSON nods toward the next room:My grandchildren ALEXANDER HAMILTON Excuse me . THOMAS JEFFERSON This is like old times , General . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Do you realize how dangerous this situation has become ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Yes . p. 122 ALEXANDER HAMILTON I came here to compromise . I hoped to avert the more drastic alternative . But the years have made you even more pigheaded , if possible . I might have spared myself this trouble . THOMAS JEFFERSON I could n't enter the presidency with my hands tied . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Do n't concern yourself . You wo n't enter it at all ! My friends are meeting tonight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether and choose their own man . THOMAS JEFFERSON grimly:They would be smashing the Constitution . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Stretching it ! THOMAS JEFFERSON rises:Smashing it , I say . HAMILTON shrugs his shoulders , turns to go.Have you seen the crowds about the Capitol Building ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON A pistol-shot and they 'd disperse . THOMAS JEFFERSON Do n't deceive yourself ! Our people will not be " put aside . " Hands him a letter.From Maryland . Fifteen hundred men met last night . Resolved : If anyone dares usurp the presidency , they will come here in a body and assassinate him . He picks up several letters.From Governor McKean of Pennsylvania From Governor Monroe of Virginia . Their militia are ready to march at a moment 's notice . If you put aside this election tonight , tomorrow morning there will be blood in the streets . p. 123 ALEXANDER HAMILTON I am an old soldier , Mr. Jefferson . If you give us no alternative THOMAS JEFFERSON But you have an alternative . End this deadlock at once ! Use your influence with your friends . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAMILTON Are n't you being whimsical ? THOMAS JEFFERSON No . I should honestly prefer that . ALEXANDER HAMILTON So you want Aaron Burr to be president ? THOMAS JEFFERSON He 's a superior man , energetic , sharp , believes in our people . ALEXANDER HAMILTON God ! You 're gullible ! I know the man . He despises your Democracy more than I. Yet he has chimed in with all its absurdities . Why ? Because he is cunning , and audacious , and absolutely without morality  --  possessed of only one principle , to get power by any means and keep it by all . THOMAS JEFFERSON That 's an opinion . ALEXANDER HAMILTON That 's a fact . He has said it to me to my face . A dozen times . THOMAS JEFFERSON He has sworn the contrary to me . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Burr has been bankrupt for years . Yet he spent vast sums of money on this campaign . Where do they come from ? p. 124 THOMAS JEFFERSON I do n't know . ALEXANDER HAMILTON What do you think has been the sole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the toasts drunk ? Can you guess ? THOMAS JEFFERSON No . ALEXANDER HAMILTON The man who supplies his funds , the man with whose agents he is in daily conference . THOMAS JEFFERSON What man ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON Bonaparte . THOMAS JEFFERSON Bonaparte ? I can hardly ALEXANDER HAMILTON extracts some documents from his pocket and places them on the desk:Proofs , if you wish them . Burr is the Cataline of America . He 'll dare anything . You may as well think to bind a giant by cobwebs as his ambition by promises . Once president , he 'd destroy all our institutions . Usurp for himself complete and permanent power . Make himself dictator . THOMAS JEFFERSON I know you have no faith in them , but do you think the American people would stand idly by ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON No , I have no faith in them .

ALEXANDER HAMILTON Excellent ! I 've commissioned him to sculpt one of the Great Man for me . JEFFERSON looks up , sighs.Well ? JEFFERSON lays down the papers . He is tired and confused.You 've been duped , my friend . THOMAS JEFFERSON smiles feebly:I suspected only you . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Of what ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Planning to be our Bonaparte . ALEXANDER HAMILTON When Washington died , I could have . Why did n't I ? THOMAS JEFFERSON Why ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON Burr asked me that question . Contemptuously . This may be difficult for you , but try to grasp it . I happen to love this country , too . I have fought for it in field and council . Above every small , selfish , personal desire , I want to see it peaceful and prosperous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Pause . THOMAS JEFFERSON miserably:I ca n't . ALEXANDER HAMILTON moves to desk:My conscience is clear . I know how to proceed . p. 126 THOMAS JEFFERSON If you do this , it can only lead to the very thing you condemn . ALEXANDER HAMILTON reaches for papers:Perhaps . Perhaps that is the only hope for us in a world of Bonapartes and Burrs . THOMAS JEFFERSON Then what will we have gained ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON Good day , Mr. Jefferson . Goes to the door . THOMAS JEFFERSON rising:I warn you , there will be bloodshed tomorrow . ALEXANDER HAMILTON Oh , no , there wo n't . You see , I 'm counting on you . You will prevent it . THOMAS JEFFERSON with sudden newborn fierceness:You 're wrong , my friend . ALEXANDER HAMILTON pauses , turns:You 'd condone it ? THOMAS JEFFERSON crosses to HAMILTON:I 'd be part of it . ALEXANDER HAMILTON You ? THOMAS JEFFERSON growls:I . ALEXANDER HAMILTON returns , looks at him , surprised:You really mean it . p. 127 THOMAS JEFFERSON By the God that made me , I mean it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second . ALEXANDER HAMILTON You amaze me . THOMAS JEFFERSON Why ? Is n't the blood of patriots and tyrants the natural manure for liberty ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON You 've become a tough old man . THOMAS JEFFERSON Who made me tough ? ALEXANDER HAMILTON laughs ironically:Then I have n't lived in vain . THOMAS JEFFERSON That 's right . HAMILTON is staring at JEFFERSON.Listen to me , Hamilton ! ALEXANDER HAMILTON This is a strange THOMAS JEFFERSON Listen to me ! I know you love this country . But you have never understood it . You 're afraid of Bonaparte ? Well , there 's no need to be . Bonaparte will die and his tyrannies will die , and we will be living , and we will be free . You 're afraid of Burr ? If Burr tries any quixotic adventures , he will smash himself against the rocks of our people . You see , this is the mistake you have always made . You have never properly estimated the character of the American people . You still do n't understand them . At this moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I confess it . I do n't . Sits . THOMAS JEFFERSON standing over him . Gently:This is not the way , Hamilton . Believe me . If you really love this country , this is n't the way . Our people who fought the revolution from a pure love of liberty , who made every sacrifice and met every danger , did not expend their blood and substance to change this master for that . His voice grows strong.But to take their freedom in their own hands , so that never again would the corrupt will of one man oppress them . You 'll not make these people hold their breath at the caprice , or submit to the rods and the hatchet , of a dictator . You can not fix fear in their hearts , or make fear their principle of government . I know them . I place my faith in them . I have no fears for their ultimate victory . ALEXANDER HAMILTON wavering:I wish I had such faith . Shakes his head. I do n't know . I frankly do n't know . I find myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more foreign to this land . THOMAS JEFFERSON Yet you helped build it . ALEXANDER HAMILTON There is a tide here that sweeps men to the fashioning of some strange destiny , even against their will . I never believed in this  --  and yet , as you say , I helped build it . Every inch of it . Pause . He rises.And still , I must admit it has worked better than I thought . If it could survive  --  if p. 129 THOMAS JEFFERSON It can . And it will . This tide is irresistible . You can not hold it back . This is the rising flood of man 's long-lost freedom . Try as you will , you can not stop it . You may deflect it for a moment . But in the end you will lose . Try the old way of tyranny and usurpation , and you mustlose . Bonapartes may retard the epoch of man 's deliverance , they may bathe the world in rivers of blood yet to flow , and still , still , in the end , they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to liberty and self-government . No , General Hamilton , this way you lose . Believe me . He crosses to his desk , crisp and final.I shall not compromise , General Hamilton . You do whatever you choose . I can not compromise on this . ALEXANDER HAMILTON holds out his hand . It is shaky:Since the fever took me , I ca n't hit the side of a barn with a pistol . Burr is cool as a snake , and one of the best shots in America . I 've fought him for five years now . If I cross him in this  --  he will challenge me . I have no doubt of that . I am a dead man , already . But at least you are honest . I shall urge my friends to break the deadlock . You will be president . Your victory is complete . THOMAS JEFFERSON There is no personal victory in this for me . I did n't want this for myself . I still do n't . If it will give you any satisfaction , my own affairs have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mend them , I might have saved myself from bankruptcy . As president , I am certain to lose everything I possess , including Monticello , where my wife and four of my children lie . Where all the dreams of my youth lie . No matter ! I thank you  --  for a glorious misery . HAMILTON bows , goes . JEFFERSON turns , stares at the statue of Washington . p. 130 CURTAIN p. 131 Act 3 , Scene 2 ACT THREE : Scene 2 The interior of the Senate Chamber .

His glance rests on PATSY , standing proudly with ANNE and JEFF . PATSY smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audience , begins to speak in a voice hesitant and uncertain .
