In Cairo last week a freckled , pug-nosed Arab soldier-adventurer basked in glory . The Arab press hailed him as a hero . The exiled Mufti of Jerusalem , grey-bearded Haj Amin El-Husseini , received him warmly . The Lebanese Legation gave a reception for him . He granted interviews in his suite at the Hotel Continental , talked cheerfully about starting an Arab war against both British and Jews in Palestine . <P> The name of the 49-year-old man in a well-cut blue-grey suit was Fawzi Kawukji . To thousands of Arabs in the Middle East the name carried a ring of romantic derring-do . To hundreds of Arabs in Palestine , as to all of Palestine 's Jews , the name was a synonym for terror . To the British it spelled trouble . <P> Fawzi ( rhymes with frowzy ) and the wily Mufti had made plenty of it for Britain before and during World War II . They had plotted and carried out antiBritish riots and killings in Palestine a decade ago . Early in 1941 , when Britain 's war fortunes were at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A slippery guerrilla , Fawzi harassed the British for months with desert forays against their vital oil pipelines . When British fortunes turned , the Mufti and Fawzi got away separately to Germany . <P> Two Men , Two " Armies . " Now they had their heads together again . Each had managed somehow to " escape " postwar Germany and to get airplane bookings from Paris into their Arab sphere . Fawzi chuckled as he told how he and his tall , 26-year-old German wife had almost been in British hands in Palestine , where there is a 2,000 price on his head . Their Paris-to-Cairo plane made an unscheduled , hour-long stop at the Lydda airport , surrounded by British cops . Their names were on the flight list , their baggage plainly marked . But no Briton came near the plane as they sat inside . <P> Last week the Mufti was busy with plans in which his old pal Fawzi would be very handy . The Mufti came up with a tax on Palestine Arabs to raise $900,000 to fight Zionism . Part of the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Futuwa and Najada ( together they number about 10,000 ) . Among their avowed purposes is persuasion of Palestine Arabs not to sell land to Jews . The Mufti had his picture taken as he reviewed a visiting Najada detachment . The picture turned out remarkably like the one he had taken in 1943 , while reviewing a detachment of Bosnian Moslems he organized in Yugoslavia for the Nazis ( see cuts ) . <P> Blustery Fawzi , who had organized other armies for the Mufti , assigned himself a leading role . Said he : " I 'm ready to go back to Palestine when the time is ripe . The Arabs will fight rather than accept partition and I am ready to lead that fight . "
