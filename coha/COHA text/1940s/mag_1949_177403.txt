The slump in used-car sales and the high price of new cars brought spring rumors that the big motormakers would soon bring out light cars priced at about $1,000 . Last week young Henry Ford II followed General Motors in scotching the rumor . Ford is not considering such a car , he said , because motorists " want the best they can get for their money and are too accustomed to the convenience and ease offered by standard-size cars . " The average length of motor trips is almost twice what it was prewar , said Ford , and the public is all in favor of the bigger luggage space in the postwar cars . " Such improvements , " he said , " certainly can not be made by materially reducing the size of the car . "
