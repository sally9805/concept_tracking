One day last week a rickety , hard-used little toy wagon , with most of the red paint scuffed off the magic word " Express " on its side , was parked casually at the base of the fat , towering northwest column of the White House front portico . Beside it rested a vehicular gadget best known to childhood as an " Irish Mail , " a contraption very like a railroad handcar . <P> Both these toys lay neglected as Master John Boettiger , 5 , pursued his recurring ambition to become a White House guard . But not for long . Interests ebb &; flow fast at five . Soon , Johnny was back at his habit of riding the Irish Mail or the Express wagon back &; forth on the long cement walkway that stretches just south of the sprawling White House , flashing briefly at one end into the vision of his grandfather , the President of the U.S. <P> Master John 's parents last week were back in the White House to stay , so that Anna Roosevelt Boettiger , the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Anna Boettiger ( rhymes with hot-i-grr ) , tall , rangy , good-natured and now 38 , is also on hand to make sure that the President follows his new , relaxed routine . <P> Eleanor Roosevelt described the goal in a brief My Day reference : " We are going to keep him away from work for certain periods of time , no matter how unpopular we are . " Wife &; daughter want to guard the strength Franklin Roosevelt regained in his rest at Bernard Baruch 's Hobcaw Barony . Now that the President has abandoned his luncheons with politicians , generals , admirals , diplomats and visiting firemen , Anna Boettiger frequently lunches with him , and the conversation is deliberately kept light . <P> Soldier Boy . Anna 's day at the White House begins at 6:45 a.m. ( she always means to get up at 6:30 , but never makes it ) . The Boettigers , including little Johnny , all sleep in one bedroom ( under the President 's rules , it is a violation of military security to say which one ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has his own later , in bed ) . <P> Then Major Boettiger , an AMG official stationed at the War Department since his return from Italy early this year , goes off to work , and little Johnny goes off to kindergarten . The boy stays there until 4 p.m. , eating lunch and taking a nap at the school . He rides both ways on the street car , accompanied by a Secret Service man . <P> Things are pretty quiet around the White House until Johnny comes march ing home . He quickly changes into his khaki uniform , Sam Browne belt and over seas cap , which are as near to G.I. as regulations allow . ( He broods over the fact that he can not wear regulation buttons , insignia and decorations . ) Sometimes he gets in an awkwardly uneven game of ping-pong with his mother , or a swim , but usually he breaks out of doors to climb trees and get all dirty . When this palls he remembers his ambition , and strides down to the guard house to help the soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the time his father and mother and Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt have dinner together . <P> Children 's horseplay has been missing from the White House ever since Johnny 's half sister and half brother ( Sistie &; Buzzie ) went away . Sistie , now a handsome and dignified 17 , is a junior at a San Francisco girls ' school ; Buzzie , 14 , will enter high school in Seattle in the fall .
