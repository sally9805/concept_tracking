FAIL to see , " observed the Chicago Sun editorially on November 30th , " how censors are justified in suppressing or delaying transmission to England of private , critical American opinion concerning the status of Admiral Darlan . What can we say about a censorship which forbids the shipment to England of new printings of Erskine Caldwell ' s 1933 book , God 's Little Acre , ' previously published both in the United States and in Great Britain ? To win the war is it necessary to make the people of England think that there are no depressed economic groups and no race problems in the United States ? " I tried to cable these sentences , together with other extracts from the article , to The Daily Telegraph . A few minutes after my message had been filed the telephone rang , and there was my old friend , the Navy censor , telling me that the words that I have italicized above had been deleted . This has been happening ever since Pearl Harbor to British correspondents in the United States . Correspondents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also been subject to censorship , but in this article I propose to deal mainly with my own experiences . As an indication of my colleagues ' feelings on the subject I could not do better than cite from a speech made last October by S. Randal Heymanson , representative of the Australian Newspapers Service and President of the Foreign Press Association . He said : " American censorship has often been severe ; many things printed in every newspaper from coast to coast are not suffered to reach the outside world . . . . The censorship authorities by this time must be aware of the sincere desire of the foreign correspondents to co-operate with them in their difficult and thankless task . The broad picture which we have given of America over a period of years has been so overwhelmingly bright that we should be misleading our millions of readers and doing America no service if we did not sketch in the shadows . " I estimate that of some 500,000 words that I cabled or wirelessed to London during the year following December 7 , 1941 , approximately 10,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gather that my losses were not above the average . In the weeks immediately after Pearl Harbor between 200,000 and 250,000 words of press matter were leaving the United States each day . The total has now crept up to 500,000 words a day , an increase attributed to a variety of causes , one of which is the growing interest in all parts of the world in American affairs . Another is that official documents and speeches are now being sent abroad at great length by the Office of War Information and similar government agencies . In the early days at least one and one-half per cent of the press matter was deleted by censors . In the past four months , I am told , deletions have declined to the remarkably small figure of about .75 per cent , or 3,500 words a day . This is due in part no doubt to the increased volume of official matter , but it is also the result of the growing liberality of the censors . Although on what President Roosevelt has called the " day of great infamy " censorship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a two-way affair , little was said about it publicly until recently . This is not because things have got worse . On the whole they have got much better . But if there was little public discussion of this problem in the early days it was because British correspondents here took the view that they should be patient until censorship settled down , and they also hugged the belief that quiet discussion with the officials of the Office of Censorship might produce better results than public clamor . They were not altogether wrong about this . Censorship has settled down . It works far more smoothly to-day than it did in the first hectic weeks after America went into the war . Mechanically it is more perfect , for pneumatic tubes were soon installed between the head offices of the cable companies in New York and the office in Broad Street where many of the press censors do their work , thereby saving the time that was formerly wasted while messenger boys carried copy back and forth . The censorship stair has also been well organized , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13,500 Office of Censorship employees , 95 per cent handle postal and cable censorship , while a staff of about 30 deals with the censorship problems of more than 13,000 American newspapers and broadcasting stations . There are some 70 censorsworking on press cables and wireless messages , nearly 3,000 being engaged in the censorship of other cables , while the Postal Censorship , which deals not only with letters but also with American newspapers and magazines leaving the country , has a personnel of more than 10,000 . Many of the cable censors are in the Navy , while the mails are the special business of the Army ; but all are directed by the civilian Office of Censorship . If foreign correspondents want articles which they send by post dealt with expeditiously they can entrust them to the Navy censors who handle their cables and wireless messages . Blind censorship was never enforced here as a policy , but for a time the staff of censors was so small , and the telephones at their service were so few , that newspaper men were not notified when their copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no idea what our London offices were receiving . Since March 1st , however , it has been the invariable custom for the censors to call the men who work in New York whenever their messages are altered , and they are free , if they feel that the sense of what they have written has been distorted by deletions or modifications , to cancel the whole message . Those inW ashingt on are advised by telegram . II W HETHER the policy that guides the censors has been altered at all as a result of long-drawn-out discussions with them is doubtful . Certainly the rules have not been changed in essentials . Nevertheless censorship is in some ways less arbitrary than it was a year ago . This is partly because the men on deck are more familiar with their job . ( Many of the press censors are former journalists , but now that they are in Navy uniform their offices are decks , and their turns of duty are watches . ) It may also be to some extent because we have been able to marshal impressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be rather inclined to doubt . It would be easy to illustrate the improvements that have taken place . In the early days , on February 1 , 1942 , found myself compelled to cable : " Editor sorry it can not be done best permissible follows , " in response to a request from London for : " Good story changes American life and conditions since Pearl Harbor . " An exchange of views with the censor had made it clear that many points I would have liked to have mentioned would not be passed . My reply , hinting at this , was killed on the grounds that it drew attention to the censorship . That would not happen to-day . We often send private messages to our editors telling them what we can not do . We also send dispatches criticizing the censorship . As its director , Mr. Byron Price , once said in an interview : " Criticizing censorship is a good , healthy , American reaction , and perfectly understandable . : Nobody shall ever be censored , or censured , for attacking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in February , 1942 , I tried to avoid all the things I had been advised to avoid , but it was badly cut ne-:ertheless . From my reference to that striking feature of all-out effort ? the cessation of motor-car production ? the adjective " striking " was pruned on the grounds that it was too strong . I was not allowed to say that some Americans were having their homes repainted , possibly for the last time , as this would have implied an impending paint shortage . A picturesque passage about the American E= ' .1-/e on that perhaps not very distant day when motor-cars would very largely have di-appeared from it was slaughtered on tl- grounds that it was too gloomy . In a letter to Mr. Price about this particular article I wrote : " What worries rse is the thought that habits may become ingrained which will lead to a gradual killing off of everything calculated to give the British people a true picture of their American Allies , or which will make criticism difficult . Many of the stories I would have liked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain that Americans are making a great effort . If we can not send such stories , the people over there , reading nothing , will begin to assume nothing is being done . Moreover , if the idea once gets abroad that criticism is being stifled , surely the result will be to make people believe that there must be something terrible to hide . " , To this Mr. Price replied in the most friendly terms , agreeing that the dispatch in question had been heavily over-censored , and welcoming further constructive criticism . Still , I find that I was writing to him again in April to question the wisdom of suppressing statements about shipping made by Rear Admiral Emory S. Land in The American Magazine , statements which I felt were highly encouraging and calculated to cheer the Allies , fortify the neutrals , and depress the Axis . In the same letter I asked why on earth an Associated Press report from Philadelphia that a Saturday Evening Post stockholder was taking legal action against the magazine in an attempt to make it change its isolationist editorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1942 , quotations from a speech by Supreme Court Justice Owen Roberts in which he said , " I can not understand the smugness of the United States , I can not understand its complacency , " were suppressed . On February 9th , the following anecdote died : " Washington tells a story , I 'm sure apocryphal , of a clerk who substituted for his own portrait on his War Department identity badge that of Adolf Hitler , and wore it unchallenged for a week . " ( A valuable hint to German spies ? ) On March 20th the following passage was deleted : " Mr. Willkie , as toastmaster , deplored the race discrimination which prevented Negroes from serving as combatants in the U. S. Navy , and cited the heroism of a Negro messman serving aboard the battleship Arizona at Pearl Harbor who seized a machine gun and fired at the Japanese until the ammunition was exhausted . " On July 20th a column-long piece by the Washington correspondent of The Wall Street Journal questioning whether sufficient military supplies were being sent abroad under Lend-Lease came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War Information issued a statement confirming the assertions made in this article . ' On July 30th this sentence came out : " Already it is jokingly said in New York that Army doctors no longer examine recruits ' eyes , but merely count them . " , On September 29th , the statement that Supreme Court Justice Frank Murphy " asserted to-day that reports about Detroit being divided on the war effort were exaggerated " was deleted . On October 12th we were not allowed to say that Mr. Willkie had returned to the United States from China by way of Siberia , on the theory that this is a secret route , but fifteen days later he broadcast to the entire world an account of how he " crossed the vast expanse of the Gobi Desert and the Mongolian Republic , crossed thousands of miles of Siberia , crossed the Bering Sea , the full length of Alaska and the full width of Canada . " On November 3rd , Election Day , I sent three versions of a weather story . Number 1 ran : " In some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be safe to describe in detail without giving valuable information to the enemy discouraged many who might otherwise have performed their duties as citizens . " That died a quick death . Number 2 ran : " Although it is forbidden under censorship regulations to say anything about that highly important factor in American elections , the weather , it might perhaps be indicated that in New York at least neither side derived any great advantage from the elements . During one part of the day there was what is traditionally regarded as Democratic weather , ' and during another part of the day there was ' Republican weather . " ' That would not do either . Number 3 ran : " Although weather plays an important part in every election in a country of great open spaces like the United States , where the party depending largely upon the rural vote is apt to suffer if it rains or snows , it is impossible under wartime regulations to make any reference to climatic conditions in dispatches going abroad . As far as the outside world is concerned , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevailed to-day must for some time remain a closely guarded ? secret " That one survived , and I hope the American soldiers in England were glad to get the news . On November 24th an extract from Mr Robert J. Casey 's new book Torpedo Junction , hinting that Tokyo was perhaps bombed from an aircraft carrier , fell by the wayside . On the following day we lost a fivehundred-word article by the distinguished French journalist , Pertinax , explaining the background of the political situation in North Africa . On November 30th the following sentence was modified : " This week the trade journal Editor &; Publisher devotes a page and a half to a symposium of eight British correspondents ' views on American censorship , which is , it is generally agreed , more restrictive than British censorship when it comes to quoting from articles appearing in the Press , to speeches , and to dispatches discussing such political questions as the treatment accorded Darlan in . North Africa . " ( This was made to read " dispatches discussing certain political questions . " ) On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mr. Donald W. Douglas to his aircraft workers for less absenteeism was suppressed . On December 7th a story about a riot in a California internment camp for Japanese nationals was killed . Many more instances might be given . Sometimes a message is allowed to go forward after valuable time has been wasted discussing its merits . Thus on September 22nd , after deleting the figures from a report which Representative Carl Vinson , Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee , had prepared to illustrate the growing strength of the American Navy , the censors agreed to pass them . In this instance we pointed out to them that the figures had been released , after careful consideration , in order to encourage the peoples of the United Nations . But before this argument prevailed our early editions had gone to bed . Sometimes a correspondent 's personal view of the state of public opinion is modified tor him . Thus in September I wrote a story saying that some Americans were tremendously indignant about the President 's threat to go over the head of the Congress if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? , quite clear that this was not the reaction of most Americans , and , indeed , quoted several editorials to emphasize the fact . Nevertheless the word " tremendously " was deleted . III ri-InE SPOTLIGHT lately has been turned j on American censorship , largely as a result of the loud cries of pain uttered by American correspondents in London who have become convinced that British censors , taking their cue from their American brethren , are getting more tough . From conversations with American friends I have discovered that few of them realize how liberal British censorship has been about letting out of the country criticisms of the government , and anything that might be printed in the British newspapers , which , like the American ones , submit to a voluntary system of self-censorship . These friends have often shown me very frank letters from England , and exclaimed : " I wonder the British censor let that through ? " Clearly they were not aware that much harsher statements than the ones they showed me have frequently appeared in British editorial columns . The British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war was very well described by Britain 's Chief Press Censor , Rear Admiral G. P. Thompson , in a speech which he made in January , 1942 . " I must emphasize , " he said , " that we are not allowed to censor news merely because it would or might afford material for German propaganda . . . . Correspondents of the overseas press are allowed to speculate on current affairs and to express their opinions freely . . . . They may quote freely from the home press . . . . In brief , whatever freedom the home press has carved out for itself under the voluntary system is equally the privilege of correspondents of the press overseas . " Incidentally , in this speech Admiral Thompson reported that in one London cable office censors who handled over 1,000,000 words in one month managed to pass 75 per cent of the press cables with a delay of only one minute , and a further 20 per cent with a delay of less - 1,141-krwMAGAZIN E more difficult in New York , where some questions have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thirty miles away . The American censorship 's average time for clearing press messages is a fraction over five minutes . Many move much faster than that . Some are delayed for several hours . On March 27th , 1942 , however , the London correspondent of The New York Times complained that British censorship was getting more difficult , and reported that Mr. Brendan Bracken , the Minister of Information , had announced in the House of Commons that the censor 's blue pencil , formerly applied only to information that might help the enemy in a military sense , would in future fall on dispatches " calculated to create ill-feeling between the United Nations or between them and a neutral country . " The writer , who recalled how " valiantly " Britain had striven to maintain freedom of the press " in fact as well as in theory , despite the stress of total war , " was shocked at the thought that the new ruling " might easily prevent American correspondents from telling their readers even what British papers are saying about the war . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules of American censorship to which we most strenuously object is that which says that we are not necessarily at liberty to quote American editorials or columnists or radio commentators . This is defended on the grounds that British newspapers reach Lisbon and other parts of the Continent fairly rapidly , and that what we quote today may be twisted by Axis propagandists to-morrow . To this our reply has always been that we are in a poor way if we can not stand a little more Axis lying , and that in any case American publications get into enemy hands very rapidly in South America and elsewhere , to say nothing of what the enemy can pick up of domestic American broadcasts . A few days after Mr. Bracken made his statement American correspondents called on him to express their alarm , and received assurances that there was no intention of imposing any unreasonable restrictions , and that only " maliciously unfair distortions " would be stopped . " You will still he 2h1e . " Mr. Bracken promised , " to send your papers exactly the same kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the American public the same complete picture of Britain at war , with good and bad alike , fairly reported upon . We want such reports to go . So long as the truth is told about us , we are satisfied , and you can have my assurance that nothing will be done to interfere with the truth being told . " American correspondents on leave in the United States , to whom I have talked , have admitted that this promise was kept . For a time our colleagues in London appeared to be satisfied . During November , however , they began to report that things were suddenly getting much worse . " Evidence is mounting , " Raymond Daniell cabled to The New York Tithes , " that the rules here in London are being tightened to conform with American ideas of what constitutes justification for censorship . . . . The result is that American readers of newspapers to-day are not getting as complete a picture of what is happening here among the exiled governments , or for that matter , of British reactions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of years ago . The United States is insulating the people of Britain against the thinking out loud in the United States , and Britain , through its censors , is indulging in polite reciprocation to the detriment of their lasting friendship , based on understanding reached after open discussion of their problems and differences . " Statements of this kind naturally started a very lively debate . Mr. Raymond Gram Swing declared in a broadcast on November 24th : " I do n't believe we can collaborate with Britain in this war or after this war one whit better through the ministering devices of a paternal censorship or any other form of polite concealment . . . . Granted , there will be unfair and unrepresentative criticism . Granted , it will make persons angry . But such criticism invokes a stream of information and knowledge that corrects it . That is the lesson of free speech . " Mr. Raymond Clapper wrote in his column on November 30th : " The political censorship which has been going on both here and in London is unfortunate . Asusually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? In the course of the row the dirt comes out anyway . Not only is nothing gained by this political censorship but you build up the suspicion on both sides of the Atlantic that a lot more political discussion is being bottled up . " Mr. Arthur Robb pointed out in Editor &; Publisher : " If our labor situation is bad , that fact helps our enemies . The news of it does not . . . . The minute we distrust our capacity to appear in our true light before both friend and foe , that minute we begin to fail as an exponent of democratic principles . " Miss Dorothy Thompson insisted in her column on November 27th that one disadvantage of censorship of opinion is that everything allowed to go through receives by inference the imprint of government approval . IV w nEN President Roosevelt at his press conference on December 16 , 1941 , announced the appointment of Mr. Byron Price as Director of Censorship he read a general statement of policy which started with the paragraph : " All Americans abhor censorship , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all other nations has demonstrated that some degree of censorship is essential in wartime , and we are at war . " The great question is : What degree of censorship is necessary ? Is American censorship too tough ? Mr. Price , a working newspaperman since 1909 , dislikes censorship as much as anyone . " Americans will never like censorship , " he agreed in a speech in New York on October 28th . " Individually and as a nation we do n't like being pushed around . " If that is how Americans feel it is easy to imagine the reactions of frustrated foreign correspondents . I can hardly give an adequate description of my own feelings on a day in January , 1942 , when , having with great difficulty obtained an exclusive , long-distance telephone description of Mr. Winston Churchill 's stay in Florida from one of the people who had lunched with him there , Miss Elsa Maxwell , I was told that not a word of it could be sent to London . Mr. Churchill had already left , and there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it remained absolute . In the speech from which I have quoted , Mr. Price remarked : " A . . . principle underlying domestic voluntary censorship is that it deals only with information , and does not invade the realm of editorial or other opinion . " Unfortunately this principle does not always hold good when it comes to dispatches going abroad . As Mr. Price explained in an interview with Mr. Arthur Krock , published in the magazine section of The New Tork Times on August 16th : " I think there is a point in being a little careful about letting too pessimistic news go out of the country , because it serves no purpose and it might do damage . " It would seem that this policy is a peculiarity of this war . Mr. Percy S. Bullen , American correspondent of The Daily Telegraph for thirty-two years until his retirement in 1934 , writes to me : " So far as I can recall we were not troubled in any way by censors " after the United States entered the last war . Happy days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made about the American censorship are too harsh . For example , on December 7th Time asserted : " British correspondents in the United States have not been permitted by U. S. censors to tell their British readers that many U. S. citizens disapproved the Churchill Government 's Indian policy . " Things are not as bad as that . Probably birth was given to the legend that they are by the suppression of one particularly raw comment made by Mr. Clapper . My own dispatch quoting it , sent on September 15th , was as follows ( the passage in italics was deleted by the censor ) : " Discussion of India in the American press has taken a new turn since Mr. Churchill made his speech on the subject in the House of Commons , and much of this editorial comment is in a highly critical vein . Thus Raymond Clapper , columnist for the Scripps-Howard newspapers , who usually writes in an informed manner about world affairs , to-day makes the following statement : The utterances of Churchill and Amery reveal an attitude little different from that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite of everything that we profess to hope for out of this war . ' Less hysterical , but nevertheless distinctly critical , is a leading article in to-day 's New York Times , which says , etc . " In point of fact , we have been allowed to send many American criticisms of British policy , in India and elsewhere . I think it would be quite wrong to suggest that British readers are missing the broad facts of American life . It is some of the highlights and some of the shadows that are lacking , and the very knowledge that they are will tend to undermine public confidence in dispatches from the United States . And the small percentage that goes into the wastebasket is often the most significant part of the day 's news , for it must be remembered that the correspondents usually steer clear of subjects which they know to be taboo , including obvious military information . They would none of them wish even to try to send anything that might honestly be described as information of aid and comfort to the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ censorship is not political in the sense that it is employed for the political advantage of the party in power . It is political only in the sense that it sometimes bears down hard on references to delicate political situations , such as the one in North Africa . The men who run it are as honest and as efficient as the Bank of England . What makes us complain is the tendency to soft-pedal controversial subjects , which we feel the American and British peoples are adult enough to discuss openly , even in wartime , and the effects of using the yardstick : " Will this make good propaganda for the enemy ? " Such a yardstick rules out references to such skeletons in the national cupboard as the Negro problem . As for controversies , if we can not send criticism , how can the British people change their policy , if it is wrong , or answer the criticism , if that criticism is unfair , unfounded , and unjustified ? For example , when Mr. Drew Pearson claimed in his widely read column that American Lend-Lease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotland , and inferior British equipment substituted ( as if we made such a thing ! ) , I was not allowed to report this damaging statement . Such a report would have brought forth an immediate denial . Fortunately Mr. Pearson himself set the record straight some weeks later , when he explained that it was General Eisenhower who " intercepted " those supplies for his North African campaign . Therefore , we make a plea for a more liberal administration of the censorship of press messages leaving the United States , being convinced that in this matter America has nothing more , and nothing less , than her reputation for freedom of speech to defend . We think that the censorship should be less tough than it has been , and we hope and pray that it will not grow more tough than it is . For as Mr. Price has said : " It has been the lesson of history that censorship feeds on itself and that once any man is given the authority of suppression , the tendency is to expand that authority more and more until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
