txt Are food costs high today ? What a questilin ! Of course they are ! Is n't everybody and his brother complaining about the high costs of food , not only in the big cities but in the smaller towns and villages ? What are some of the reasons for this ? And what about wages today ? Those are two questions answered today . On the one hand by Franrtis C. Smith , Essex County . AgrE:ultural Agent , and on the 1 other by the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics . ? Wages Buy More According to ' .. ne latter , with his week 's wages , the average industrial worker  --  mind you , they say " average " ? could buy more of five out of seven popular meat cuts in May of this year than in May , 193 : . The following comparison , the Bureau points out , shows that the average production worker could buy more round steak , rib roast , chuck roast , leg of lamb , and sliced ham with his weekly earnings than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one week 's earnings . May May 1939 1947 Round Steak 66 71 Rib Roast 79 86 Chuck Roast 100 106 Leg of Lamb 79 80 Sliced Ham 51 55 In the case of two cuts ( sliced bacon and pork chops ) , the Bureau adds , the contrary was true . Why the Complaint. ? Why then , the general complaint on the high costs of food ? Figures compiled by Mr. Smith for the five prewar years show that food took 23 per cent of the average consumer 's income . Today , food takes but 19 per cent of the consumer 's income for the same quantity of food . But ? we are eating more food . " No country , " says Mr. Smith , " can support a high wage level ; divert one-third of its income to taxes ; ship nearly one third of its food and fiber abroad , and still have low-cost food . Them  --  why does the average consumer think that food costs are higher ? Partly because he eats more and better , Mr. Smith adds . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of the consumer 's income today , he really is consuming 23 per cent of his income still  --  because he is eating more food . Before the War For example , before the war the per capita consumption of eggs was 299 annually . Today , it is 378 . Fluid milk and cream consumption per capita has gone up to 200 quarts annually , or an increase of 26 per cent . All meats , including poultry , are up to 183 pounds per capita annually , or a 25 per cent increase . All of this means better diet , better nutrition , a balance of milk , eggs , meat , fruit , and vegetables . " But , let 's not blame it all on the farmer . Maybe the high wages all along the line from the farm to the truck driver to the dealer to the delivery man all have taken their share , " Mr. Smith points out . For another thing , taxes have gone up . Teachers , policemen , firemen , and materials all cost the municipalities more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in taxes from business , or about one-sixth the cost of all goods sold . No Income Tax Before the war , a young couple earning S40 to S50 a week paid no income tax . But , today , they must pay an income tax sufficient to buy the food for a third person . During the war , the $50-a-week income increased , so the present tax on this increased income would buy the food for three extra persons , Mr. Smith adds . Farmers ' costs of production have more than doubled since prewar years , with increased labor costs one of the chief items . A recent survey shows the Farm Price . Index is at 242 , compared with the five-year prewar index of 120 ? an increase of 122 . Factory workers ' wages , however , went from a prewar average of 299 to 414 , or an increase of 125 in the index . " Remember , " Mx . Smith enjoins , " all of these indexes began for the period of 1909 to 1913 , at 100 . " Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or food ?
