As Port-de-Bouc 's solitary church bell struck six , the shrill blast of a ship 's siren split the air . This was the deadline the British had set . If the 4,424 Palestine-barred Jews aboard three British prison ships in Port-de-Bouc 's harbor failed to disembark , the British would order the ships to Germany . <P> Half an hour later , the last supply boat headed for the French shore , carrying six sick refugees-the Jews ' reply to the British ultimatum . The Runnymede Park put to sea , with its passengers grasping the grill of their caged-in deck and singing defiantly in Hebrew . The Ocean Vigour and Empire Rival followed . <P> For the Jews , it was a continuation of the Exodus 1947 saga . All of them had been aboard this ship when it had been rammed , attacked and captured by the British ( TIME , July 28 ) off the Palestine coast . Since then they had lived in the ships ' holds , ignoring British orders to leave and French offers of hospitality . The leaders of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palestine . We shall not land in Europe as long as we are alive . " <P> " Unpremeditated Folly . " In Britain , which only a fortnight ago had seen anti-Semitic riots , there were wide expressions of sympathy for the refugees . Commented the Manchester Guardian : " World opinion will be shocked . . . . The Government has not so much credit left in the world that it can afford to squander it in acts of unpremeditated folly . " Added the News Chronicle : " British conduct ... is moving rapidly to the ultimate stage of lunacy . . . . No one but a fool would try to compel a Jew to go to Germany of all countries . . . . " <P> Anti-Semitism was still alive in Germany . In Berlin last week a German woman , sentenced to six months in jail for offending a Jewish family living in her house , shouted at her accusers in court : " What a shame they forgot to burn you in the concentration camp ! " <P> " Come to Our Auschwitz ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships , 36 babies had been born . Around 50 more would be born in the ten to 14 days it would take the ships to reach Hamburg , according to Port-de-Bouc 's Dr. Jean Cayla . The environment they would be born into was described vividly by the New York Herald Tribune 's Ruth Gruber . Visiting the Runnymede Park just before sailing time , she reported : " We picked our way gingerly over people lying on the floor on dirty blankets . . . . While we walked the people kept shouting : ' Do n't stand up here ! This is good , there is air here ! Come below ! Come to our Auschwitz ! ' notorious Nazi extermination camp . <P> " We were led down a hazardous set of 20 slippery stairs without hand rails . The sight in the hold was like a charcoal drawing of Inferno . The brilliant sun filtered through grillwork , throwing sharp lines of light and darkness across the refugees ' faces and their hot , sweaty , half-naked bodies . . . .
