In Galveston , Tex. , where 2,000 workmen at Todd Galveston Dry Docks are on strike , the draft boards swung an anti-strike truncheon that had never been swung so vigorously before . Informed that more than 20 men of draft age , deferred because of their jobs in an essential industry , had walked out , the boards ordered them to report to draft headquarters . Purpose : to give them physical examinations , reclassify them for service in the Army , where striking is just not done . <P> A Jersey City draft board swung even more decisively . It called in a striker at the National Bearing Metals Corp. , tossed out his deferment , marked him Class 1-A ( available for military service ) .
