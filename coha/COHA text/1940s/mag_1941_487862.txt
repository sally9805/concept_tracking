AMERICA 'S LEADING LIBERAL WEEKLY SINCE 1865 The Shape of Things WITH THEIR BACKS TO THE WALL RUSSIAN soldiers , and civilians too , are putting up a stout fight to save Moscow . News of the battle is - meager , for both Soviet and Nazi communiques have recently been more than usually uninformative . But Russian claims that the enemy 's drive has been slowed down appear to be substantiated by the absence of German reports of the seizure of new strategic points on the central front . Lengthening communications and bad weather may have forced the German High Command to call at least a temporary halt . Meanwhile Berlin is emphasizing a renewed drive in the south . The front there is now dangerously close to the Donetz industrial district , and with the fall of Taganrog on the Sea of Azov the important city of Rostov , which is one of the gateways to the Caucasus , is in imminent danger . In Britain popular clamor for an offensive in the west to divert German strength from Russia continues . It is inspired partly by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it also expresses a natural anxiety to share the valiant fight of the Russians regardless of the risks involved . But strategy can not be decided in mass-meetings . Winston Churchill is not a man who takes kindly to a defensive role , and we can be sure that when he feels offensive action can be taken with reasonable hope of success , he will not hesitate . The security of Britain itself as the one remaining anti-Nazi base in Western Europe is paramount . The island fortress can not be stripped of men and equipment for the purpose of a Continental invasion until that venture can be mounted on such a scale as to insure against another Dunkirk . - A TIMELY REMINDER THAT THE BENEFITS of low-cost pipe-line transportation of oil go to the major oil companies rather than to consumers comes from Thurman Arnold . In an address before the Consumers ' Cooperative Association at North Kansas City , one of the best-known co-ops in the country , the Assistant Attorney General explained that pipe lines were built to the Midwest because railroad transportation was so expensive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came under the control of the great oil companies , and the rates they adopted were identical with the rail rates : The purpose in this was twofold . Had oil - pipe lines been operated as common carriers at a fair profit , the railroads would have been forced to reduce their rates , making it easier for the independents to compete with the monopolists . High pipe-line rates also gave the majors a hidden rebate on any oil carried for the independents , a rare event . To illustrate the difference between pipe-line costs and rates , Arnold said that it cost 18. % cents a barrel to carry oil from Tulsa to Kansas City , but the tariff charged was 77 cents . Arnold is now suing for recovery of all pipe-line profits over a fair return on the ground that these excess profits are really rebates , which are forbidden by the Elkins Act of 1906 . Strong pressure is being brought on the Administration and the Department of Justice to drop the suits . THOSE WHO ARE INCLINED TO BLAME LABOR for the recent wave of strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of living just released by the National Industrial Conference Board . These show a total increase of 8.1 per cent in the living costs of working-class families since the outbreak of the war . More than two-thirds of this increase . has taken place since January 1 , and two-fifths of it since June . This is obviously but the beginning . Food costs have risen 13.6 per cent since January , and are now advancing at the rate of more than 2 per cent a month . Wholesale commodity prices have jumped 20 per cent , and raw-material prices are up 30 per cent . While some companies have granted wage increases large enough to cover the rise in living costs , this is by no means generally true . Testifying on the price-control bill before the House Banking and Currency Committee , Isador Lubin , Commissioner of Labor Statistics , dedared that the price increases would cover " very substantial wage increases in the future as- well as those already made . " He estimated that net labor costs had risen 1.2 per cent as against a 19 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase in the prices of durable goods . In view of the failure of Congress to do anything to check the inflationary rise in prices , workers have only one weapon by which they can hope to . maintain a reasonable standard of living  --  the threat to strike . It is a wasteful and costly method , but unless drastic action is taken to control prices , industrial strife may teach as disastrous proportions as during World War I. THE TRADE PACT BETWEEN ARGENTINA AND the United States represents a triumph of the first magnitude for Secretary Hull . For the better part of his term Mr. Hull has sought to heal the long-standing breach between the two countries . The ? difficulties in the way The NATION of an agreement have been many . Argentina 's economic ties have long been primarily with Europe . Its chief export products are competitive with rather than complementary to our own . Europe has also had greater cultural and political influence on it than has the United States . And as if these obstacles were not enough , organized pressure groups within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hull from making substantial concessions to Argentina . In view of the difficulties , the agreement is a remarkably satisfactory one . Argentina has agreed to cut duties , or in some instances to guarantee no further increase , on a list of items representing about 30 per cent of imports from the United States . In return we have made concessions on 84 items of Argentine export . No reduction in duty was granted on imports of fresh meat despite the current abnormally high meat prices in this country , but the duty on canned meats was tut one-third . As might be expected , Republicans and certain spokesmen of the farm bloc have attacked the agreement as threatening to reduce American farmers to a " state of peasantry . " Actually , the reduction in the duty on canned meats and hides will affect only a few farmers and those to a negligible degree , while some of the same farmers  --  and many others ? will benefit by the increased outlet for American apples , pears , grapes , raisins , prunes , - and tobacco , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American export industries will bring them after the war . Moreover , the agreement is an effective guaranty against further Nazi inroads in the richest country of Latin America . THE AMERICAN NEWSPAPER GUILD HAS JUST demonstrated that democracy works when its adherents take the trouble to put it into practice . For years now the Guild has been bedeviled by a clique of Stalinists and fellow-travelers whose policies were hung securely on the Communist Party line and Whose strangle-hold on the union was maintained by means of the unscrupulous , " ruthless tactics for which- power politicians and fanatics are well known . Time after time the membership woke up to find itself " supporting " some political position or some Stalinist-front organization which was , among other things , entirely irrelevant if not inimical to the Guild 's primary job of organizing newspaper workers left , right , and center . ' Too often the membership went right back to sleep again , after the fashion of easy-going democratic bodies . During the past two years , however , world events combined with the blatant maneuvers of the Guild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break came at the convention in June , when the administration , hoping to ward off defeat , backed the proposal of the opposition for the election of officers by referendum ; since then it has sent up the cry of unity , as politicians have done before  --  though it fought the camOctober 25 , 1941 paign with its usual weapons of misrepresentation and name-calling .. But when the votes were counted , the ad= ministration had been beaten in a ratio of five to three ; and even in New York , where its-greatest strength was concentrated , it won by the narrow margin of some 150 votes out of 2,200 : We wish the Guild 's new officers a successful  --  and democratic  --  career . * - IT IS EASY TO CARICATURE THE ELDER statesmen of the American Federation of Labor who met for two relatively tranquil weeks in Seattle . Confronted by the painful problem of George E. Browne , member of the executive council now on trial for extortion , the A. F. of L. moguls made every effort not to offend him ; instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the membership on the council , thus paving the way for his graceful exit . Only Brother Browne 's insistence upon running compelled his associates to rebuke him by methodically voting him down . They also passed a resolution containing many lofty phrases about the evils of racketeering but offering little hope of concrete action ; in fact , the chief step forward was the decision to bar convicts from central bodies of the federation . On the thorny subject of discrimination against Negroes on the part of several important A. F. of L. unions , the convention again assumed its pose of anguished inertia . A proposal by A. Philip Randolph for the appointment of a committee to deal with the problem was vigorously defeated . YET IN SPITE OF THESE ANNUAL TRAPEZE acts the A. F. of L. convention did make some affirmative and significant gestures . On the issue of the war . . William Green went farther than ever before in extending support to the President 's policy of taking whatever steps may be necessary to crush Hitlerism , including aid to Russia . Not even William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the A. F. of L. high council , dared dissent on the convention floor . As for the federation 's quarrel with the C. I. 0 . , William Green 's bid for peace talks seemed to express genuine conviction . Not all his colleagues share Mr. Green 's good intentions , but for the moment at least the next move is up to the C. 1 . 0 . THE NEW YORK CITY COUNCIL HAS NEVER lived up to the high hopes of those who argued for its formation in 1936 , and it is unlikely that it will be greatly improved after next month 's election . Because of the light registration the Council will be smaller , but there is no evidence that its composition will be much altered . In the almost endless list of candidates , however , there are at least three whose presence on the Council would , it seems to us , help to make it a more enlightened and progressive body than it has been . Sig-387 nificantly perhaps , two of the three are men who have been scuttled by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was not renominated for that office by the Republicans or the American Labor Party because he once hired a Communist ; he will run for the Council as an independent . Harry W. Laidler , who , together with Mrs. Genevieve Earle and Robert Strauss , has been one of the few real liberals in the Council , was ditched by the A. L. P. because he voted for Norman Thomas last year . George S. Counts , president of the American Federation of Teachers , is running for office for the first time and has the A. L. P. 's support . All three of these men have shown , in one way or another , that they have a genuine faith in democracy , which is something of a novelty in New York politics . " CONCENTRATION CAMP " HOBBS IS OFF ON a new tack in an effort to obtain passage of his bill to set up camps in which deportable aliens may be interned without trial . He is telling labor leaders that they have nothing to fear from the bill or from him , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white-slave and narcotic laws , most of whom , he implied , are foreigners . Official figures compiled by the Department of Justice refute this picture of the alien . In 1940 only one out of seven federal prisoners was foreign born . The percentage of foreign-born to native violators of the white-slave and narcotics laws was even lower : only one out of every eleven persons convicted was foreign born . Since these figures cover both foreign-born citizens and aliens , the ratio of deportable aliens is still lower . It is clear , ' therefore , that the alien is not the chief violator of these laws . The internment of labor leaders in Canadian concentration camps and Hobbs 's own record of votes against labor legislation , notably the wage-hour law , should dispose of his other contentions . In the meantime the bill is still in committee . Hobbs is afraid to bring it out for a vote . ) ( - A BATTLE TO FREE WOMEN FROM THE FEAR of unwanted children opened twenty-five years ago when Margaret Sanger established the first American birth-control clinic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police nine days later and condemned as a " public nuisance . " Mrs. Sanger carried her case to the New York State Supreme Court , and although she lost her appeal she won a great victory because the decision established the principle of the legal and medical right of doctors to give contraceptive information " for the cure or prevention of disease . " Today there are more than 600 clinics in 42 states . Most of the work is still being done by private organizations , for public-health authorities have been extremely backward in this field . But in North Carolina the State Board of Health has for the last three years been furnishing indigent mothers with information and materials . One result has been an impressive decline in the maternalrmortality rate . This is an example to other states . The recent report of Special Prosecutor John Amen which estimates that between 100,000 and 250,000 illegal abortions are performed in New York City every year emphasizes the crying need for more birth-control clinics.               @ @ @ @ @ @
