The blockade of Japan was on in earnest . Their fat southern empire cut off and written off , the Japanese were trying feverishly to stockpile the home islands against invasion day with raw materials from North China , Manchuria and Korea . U.S. analysts concluded last week that Japan now had only a single unbroken line of communication with the mainland - the one from northeastern Korean ports , across the Sea of Japan , to small ports on the northwest coast of Honshu . The great funnel through which the lifeblood of imports was once transfused into Japan was already fouled with wrecked ships sunk by U.S. forces . <P> The Japs themselves were authority for the statement that U.S. submarines had begun to operate in the Sea of Japan . Whether or not that was true , the subs had helped clear the South China Sea of enemy shipping and presumably would be used farther north . Japanese harbors near the neck of the funnel had felt the weight of blows from U.S. aircraft carriers ' planes . But the most continuously effective weapon for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The Wreckers . Little known to the U.S. public , but greatly feared by Jap shipmasters , are the fleet air wings , which the Navy calls " Fairwings " for short . Fairwing 1 and Fairwing 18 have been based in the Ryukyu Islands since early April . Fairwing 1 , under veteran seaplaner Rear Admiral John Dale Price , has sunk or damaged more than 200,000 tons of shipping in Korean waters . Fairwing 18 , skippered by Rear Admiral Marshall Raymond Greer ( onetime shipmate of Price in the old battleship North Dakota ) , has operated farther east , where the hunting was not so good , but sometimes it has flown over into Fairwing 1 's territory to help out . <P> The fleet air wings ' mission is primarily reconnaissance , to report enemy shipping to surface ships or bombers . But pilots dearly love to take their lumbering search planes down for bombing &; strafing runs , in the hope of crippling ships and making them easy targets for the follow-up attackers . Better still , despite the danger to their own craft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record shows how well they have done , flying Liberators , Privateers , Venturas , Mariners , Coronados and the faithful old Catalinas . <P> Typhoon Junction . The enemy may gain some respite from now until November , because the Ryukyus are the " typhoon junction " of the western Pacific . Weather will hinder U.S. forces and help some Jap ships to find shelter from U.S. bombs . But weather will not stop the blockade .
