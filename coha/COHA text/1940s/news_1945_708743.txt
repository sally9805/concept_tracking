txt A method of successfully reclaiming synthetic rubber , an antiaircraft computing gun sight used by the Navy in numbers surpassing all other antiaircraft sights combined , and a control mechanism for the Amy 's Bofors gun , were among the secret war activities , of Massachusetts Institute of Technology disclosed for the first lime today by President Karl T. Compton in a commencement address . The " Tech " President delivered the Commencement address before e a graduating class of 258 , 10 of them women . It was Technology 's 79th graduation , and it was held in New England Mutual Hall , Boston . Announcing that it was now permissible to hit a corner of the veil of secrecy that has enveloped many of M. I. T 's war protects , Dr. Compton said the Institute had performed more than 200 war research jobs . Operating Day and Night " Certain special facilities of the Institute , " he said , " with their operating staffs , have been operating steadily day and night all through the war on war jobs . ? . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by ; our center of analysis and its assembly of mechanical and electrical automatic computing devices . By far the most power tut and sophisticated computing device ever built is one whose existence or description has not been publicly announced . " It is an electrically operated differential analyzer .. . . As one ! expert . not on the M. I. T. staff expressed it ( with some exaggera ' lion ) , ' it works out the Navy 's ballistic tables in spare time after five o'clock ' " This is the latest , but by no means the last , of the remarkable group of computing devices conceived by Vannevar Bush and his colleagues , Professors Wiener , Caldwell , Taylor , Brown , and others . They solve at high speed problems of arithmetic , algebra , differential , and integral equations , statistics and rapid selec ; hon. " The Radiation Laboratory . Dr. Compton said , " is the largest research organization , so far as we know , in the history of the world . " Conducted co-operatively by a brilliant aggregation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundations , it provided the radar equipment first used by the United States Army I Air Forces , and thus helped bring about the turning point in the war against the submarine . The strategic bombing of German war industry began and continued . Dr. Compton said , with equipment designed and constructed at the M. 1 . T. Radiation Laboratory . " The Radiation Laboratory played a very important tole in making technically possible the crippling blows struck by General Doolittle 's great Air Force , " Dr. CoMpton asserted . Also hitherto undisclosed is the existence of a field service laboratory operated by M. 1 . T. in England during the final two years of the war . It had direct channels of supply , communication , and exchange of personnel with the parent laboratory in Cambridge , and it won the commendation of Lieut . Gen. Carl Spaatz in these words : " Tile technical assistance of the British Branch of the Radiation Laboratory and its associated agencies and individual experts has been indispensable ? to the Air Forces in their efforts to achieve maximum results in combat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capt . Dashiell L. Madeira , Director of Training for the Bureau of Naval Personnel in Washington , told the graduates that the country must maintain a " well-balanced Navy , one that is backed up by all the scientific brains and industrial power that this country can muster because the complete history of this and every war provides the inescapable proof of this need . " Captain Madeira said , " If we are to maintain the democratic way of life that is dear to us , we can not ignore the coercive technique . . . We must maintain a military Organization strong enough to employ coercion whenever the necessity arises . " In our search for national morality . " he urged . " let us be certain that the Christian way of tic is not destroyed because we do not have the power to defend it . Need for Strong Navy " We need a Navy so strong mat it will act as a preventive for war . . . This means a fighting Navy . The only successful Navy today is the one that is ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximate something never dreamed of before . " The Navy Captain added that had it not been for the nation 's educational system , " we would not have conquered Germany and Italy as quickly as we did and we would still have every right to worry about winning our ultimate victory over Japan . " The Navy has found , " he said , " that the illiterate sailor is practically Useless for most naval purposes if not an actual menace to the safety of his shipmates . " Captain Madeira described the vast training program of the Navy , set up during the present war and developed in " a comparatively short tine . " However , he said , it took almost two years for it to get in satisfactory shape . " New wars may and probably will strike like lightning from a clear sky , " he warned . " If another war conies , no time will be permitted to develop a new training organization . Therefore , fo ? ? the safety of our nation we must preserve a training organization that is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two fellowships offered by the Buenos Aires " Compania Argentina De Electricidad " were award ed to Carlos Alberto Revol and Angel Boccia Ros . Two du Pont fellowships were given to Robert Reynold Marshall and Sheppard Young Tyree , Jr . The Roger Defriez Hunneman Prize for the most meritorious senior who has shown outstanding originality in the field of chemical engineering was won by San-fold Joseph Neuhaus of Orange , N. J. Marshall Byer of Boston won the prize awarded by the American Bureau of Shipping for high scholarship in the course m naval architecture and marine engineering . A prize for highest scholastic standing in aeronautical engineering was won by Miss Selma Caroline Swift of Burbank , Calif . Urging that " Tech " alumni give more liberally and generally to the Institute 's scholarship and teaching funds , Alfred P. Sloan . Jr .. chairman of the Board of General Motors Corporation presented his own gift of $350,000 to endow a professorship in industrial management . He was chief speaker at the alumni dinner held Saturday night at Hotel Statler . At the same time President Compton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electric Company . had given the Institute $100,000 to endow a group of postgraduate fellowships .
