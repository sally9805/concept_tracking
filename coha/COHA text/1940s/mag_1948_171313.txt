Love from a Stranger ( Eagle-Lion ) is another of those innumerable melodramas based on the Bluebeard theme ( Chaplin 's Monsieur Verdoux turned it into major satire ) . It is doubtful that anybody will want to boycott this one : it has no moral , no psychological force-and no interest . <P> But it is prettily dressed and decorated . Sylvia Sidney , as the target for tonight , and John Hodiak , as the maniac , play it as if they 1 ) wished they were elsewhere , but 2 ) felt that they owed some kind of minimum to their employers and their conscience as craftsmen . Supporting players are given to lines like " Yon storm 'll be upon us main soon . " *Others merely curtsy , mew incoherently or tug their forelocks . For what it is worth-a middling curdler-the whole thing was much better done in 1937 by Basil Rathbone and Ann Harding . <P> Always Together ( Warner ) , a hurried , ordinary little comedy , has a few better-than-ordinary comic ideas , but they never quite come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by deathbed conscience , leaves a million dollars to a secretary ( Joyce Reynolds ) who believes that life is just like all the movies she sees . She knows , accordingly , that money is the root of all evil , and will spoil her marriage with Robert Hutton , a bitter young writer . As it turns out , he is thoroughly satisfied ; but she ca n't believe it and hurries off to Reno . Best idea in the picture : the husband becomes a national hero among men , a national monster among women , by demanding alimony . <P> Some nice but undeveloped situations and lines fight a draw with the rather childish performance of the Boy &; Girl . Best thing in the show : Humphrey Bo-gart-appearing briefly in a movie the girl goes to-as an outcast father , weeping against a rainy windowpane . <P> *It is.
