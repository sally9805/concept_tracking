Britain last week broke its own Mediterranean blockade . Minister of Economic Warfare Hugh Dalton told the House of Commons that Britain and the U.S. together would send 8,000 tons of wheat to the hungriest country in the world , Greece . <P> Bread was priced at $15 a loaf in Athens last week and there was no bread . There were no potatoes , no figs , no raisins , no tomatoes . There was , in short , famine . The sight of wasted men &; women faulting in the street was so common that no one thought anything of it . <P> In Athens and Peiraeus alone , between 1,700 and 2,000 men , women &; children are dying each day . Not all starve to death . Cholera , typhus , typhoid and dysentery run like a licking brush fire through the weakened population . In mountain settlements and island villages people live a little better . They can find roots , herbs and mussels to eat . <P> Ghouls and Beggars . Hunger has fostered a new profession . When the Athens powerhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prowl the dark cemeteries , stripping the dead of the clothes they no longer need . It has been a bitter winter in Greece , and there is no fuel . Some of the lucky ghouls find rings and necklaces on the corpses . With jewelry they can sometimes buy a mouthful of bread from Italian soldiers . <P> With hunger the Axis has managed to accomplish what it could do with no other weapon-to break the stubborn spirit of the Greek people . Hate no longer snaps from the eyes of famished Greeks ; there is no room for hate in lives that are one long , hopeless search for food . The Greek Government has begged for food from the Turks . Said a Greek official : " We are not asking for food that Turks would eat , but for food they refuse to eat . " <P> The best supply line that the Greeks have had in the last months has been a little Turkish steamer , the Kurtulus , which sailed weekly from Istanbul to Peiraeus with wheat , corn , vegetables , dried fruits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reef just off the Turkish coast and sank . <P> Design for Famine . It was not the British blockade that caused the Greek famine . The Nazi Army of Occupation last year worked like a pack of driver ants and left the country bone-clean . More than half of Greece 's wheat ( which had to be supplemented by imports in normal times ) was " sold " to Germany . Greek tomatoes , even green ones , were hurried to scurvy-ridden German troops in Africa . Livestock , dried vegetables and fruits went the same way . The Germans fried Greek potatoes in Greek fat and shipped them , cooked , back to Germany . The Nazi Army of Occupation , during the two months it was in command , bought up all stocks of clothes with bundles of their worthless " occupation marks . " By report , the only relief the Axis has given to Greece has been 10,000 tons of grain which Italy sent from her own slim stores-secretly so that underfed Italians should not protest . <P> The shipment of 8,000 tons of grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just a token . In Greece , as elsewhere in Occupied Europe , no one can be sure that relief supplies will not be grabbed by the Axis . Explained Mr. Dalton bitterly : " There is no guarantee , nor would we pay any attention to one given by the Germans . We are in this case running a risk in view of the appalling conditions caused by the Germans in Greece . "
