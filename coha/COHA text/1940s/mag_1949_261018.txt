( See Cover ) <P> Houses may not be so confining as the shells of scallops , clams and turtles , but neither do they fit , or look , as well . More &; more U.S. families , dissatisfied with the shells they live in , are out looking for better ones . In 1948 they bought or built 2.4 million homes . This year prices on new houses are down as much as 10% and business should be almost as good . How good , and how different , will the houses be ? <P> In the 19308 , half the new houses constructed were custom-built , and the new owner consequently had a 50-50 chance to express his own ideas about the practical art of housing himself and his family . Today , such speculative merchant-builders as the David D. Bohannon Organization , which is putting up thousands of moderately priced houses around San Francisco , and the traditional but gadgety Gerholz Community Homes in Flint , Mich , account for 80% of production . Biggest of these merchants , Levitt &; Sons , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) of almost identical $7,990 bungalows on the flat potato fields of Long Island . The Levitt boys knock a new house together every 16 minutes , adorn their latest model with such creature comforts as fireplaces as well as modern touches , e.g. , picture windows and movable walls that double as closets . <P> Merchant-builders increasingly favor the modern touches-at least on the inside where they wo n't glaringly show . But the man who wants a house to fit his family as well as the age he lives in still has good reason for building his own . <P> <P> Hips &; Door Butts . Such a man may choose his own lot and design his own house for a contractor to build-if he combines the patience of Job with the energy of Samson . He would begin by learning the necessary background for an intelligent lot-seeker , making it his business to study drainage , zoning , prevailing winds , taxes and prospects for taxes , new developments and proposals for new highways &; byways in the county . Before designing the house itself he would cram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than double what they were ten years ago ) , master the rudiments of architecture , and learn to speak knowingly of furring and flashing , soffits and reveals muntins and mullions , gambrels , spandrels , hips and door butts . <P> But if the would-be home-builder does not feel strong enough for all that , he will wind up at the office door of one of the nation 's 15,000 practicing architects . For a fee ranging from 5% to 15% of the total cost of the house , the architect will do some or all of the following : help choose a site , help plan the house ( or plan it altogether ) , make drawings so that the prospective owner can see what his house will look like , help choose and deal with the contractor , and supervise the actual construction .
