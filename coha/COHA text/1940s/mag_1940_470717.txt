" In 1933 he wrote an article for HARPER 'S called " Are the Tropics Unhealthy ? " which got him into a series of discussions with the Dr. Price whose White Settlers in the Tropics Mr. Hanson mentions in his present article .

NEWSPAPER MEN GO HACK TO SCHOOL rirank Snowden Hopkins was among the r first eight American newspaper men who received the Nieman Fellowships at Harvard ' University . " Quest for Wisdom " tells what happened to the first Fellows during their year in Cambridge . Last September a second batch started work . Mr. Hopkins is an editorial writer on the Baltimore Sun . He was born on a farm in Gloucester County , Virginia , in March , 1908 , graduated from William and Mary in 1927 and got a Master 's in English at Columbia in 1928 .

He has written for various periodicals and is the author of a book about Southern politics called Dixie Demagogues , published last November . A the moment " a United States of Europe " is being offered as the great cure-all for Europe 's ills . Frequently the phrase is used simply to plug a hole in a debate ; what the phrase implies is seldom examined . Destroy Hitlerisin , whatever that is , and then bring on Federation . In the effort to get some flavor of realism into this argument we are printing C. Hartley Grattan 's " The Struggle for Peace . " Mr. Grattan is the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fought . This book , published in 1929 , assembled all the available material on the economic stake ? the private loans , the trade in munitions and commodities which numerous Americans had in Al-lied victory . The study which Mr , Grattan began was carried on by others and reached its climax in the Nye investigation of the munitions industry . Mr. Grattan is thirty-seven years old . When Henry Mencken started The American Mercury in January , 1924 , he asked many of his friends for the names of young men whom he might encourage to write for the new magazine . Harry Elmer Barnes had had Grattan in his classes at Clark and gave his name to Mencken . Grattan was teaching English at Urbana Junior College in Ohio when he received a letter from the editor of the Mercury asking what he was up to . He replied with a manuscript on James Russell Lowell which appeared in the Mercury for May , 1924 . This was Grattan 's first published work .

His " The Future of the British Empire " appeared in the October HARPER 'S . WITH this fourth installment of Alclous Huxley 's " After Many a Summer " we get Dr. Obispo ready for the final leap in his search for the specific that will guarantee longevity . In the March issue comes the fifth and last portion of the novel in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otto C. Grauer in his " Back of Books " column in the Buffalo Courier-Express says that it has been " whispered about that the publication of the American edition of After Many a Summer was probably not being held up by the editorial , manufacturing , or sales departments but possibly by the legal . A reported irreverence on the part of Mr. Huxley was causing this legal head-scratching . " Mr. Grauer then compares the Magazine text with the English edition and finds the former somewhat cut and wonders whether the American edition of the book will also be excised . We hate to explode a promising scandal , but the fact is that American book publication was held up because the Magazine wanted to serialize the novel , and the Magazine cut the text simply for reasons of space . The book will appear in book form on January 25th , according to schedule . The title as well as the text will be longer than in our serialization : it will be After Many a Summer Dies Me Swan .. WAR G 011 FOR BUSINESS ? TN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describes how debt and spending are necessary to keep a depression-ridden economy going and how opposition to this spending grows . In the past few weeks we have had an illustration of this in Ohio . There Governor Bricker and the State administration had embarked on an economy program . What happened ? As might be expected , repercussions first occurred in urban areas . In Toledo , where there were 41,000 persons on relief , the wholesale grocers refused the city further credit after September 15th ; a special relief bond issue had already been voted down . Of those on relief only the children , the old people , and the ill were being fed . By December the schools were closed and the churches and the park system were " conducting classes and creating activities to occupy the thousands of children left idle by the closing of the schools . " A New York Times dispatch stated that the City Manager was concerned about whether the police , fire , and public health services could be maintained . Meantime a similar crisis had arisen in Cleveland . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , embracing 60,000 persons ; $100,000 was available for relief purposes until the end of the year , and at /east $1,000,000 was needed . Twelve thousand of the cases were dropped . Mr. Flynn is the great Cassandra among American economic writers and his score of accurate shots is high . He is a unique character whose reputation has spread abroad . Francois Delaisi , for example , has been referred to as the John T. Flynn of France . Unattached to any group , not an academic or a professional economist , Mr. Flynn was a newspaper man for many years and especially interested in the operations of Wall Street . Over a period of years he held various newspaper jobs , ending as managing editor of the New York Globe . When Frank A. Munsey killed that paper , Mr. Flynn quit journalism and became a free-lance writer on business and economics and has been known after 1929 as one of the most acute and devastating critics of American business methods .

Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is editor of the Virginia Quarpeople find themselves , as did the American colonists , confronted by conditions in which they felt it their duty , amounting to a spiritual compulsion , to resist . Under such circumstances , she said , they had to tight , because it became a matter of living up to one 's highest convictions , and if , feeling they had to do a thing , people did not do it , they did do something rather serious to themselves , the higher values involved in such a refusal being more important than the dangers of war . " If a people believe they have reached a point in their national life when they must either fight or give up a principle , then it would certainly do something to the spirit of the nation if they did not go through , " she said . NEW YORK , December 20th ? Mrs. Dorothy Dunbar Bromley said yesterday that her article in HARPER 'S MAGAZINE , quoting Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt , had been read and corrected in manuscript by Mrs. Roosevelt before publication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disavowed views on war attributed to her in the article . In reply Mrs. Bromley quoted as follows from a letter from Mrs. Roosevelt dated September 2d : " I have written in on page 32 of the manuscript , ' When we were convinced that there was something we believed in at stake there . ' I consider it important , because I do not think you quite understood my point of view . It would only do something to our people spiritually to stay out of war if we were convinced that there was something we believed in at stake , and not just a human interest , but a fundamental conviction that one side or the other represented ideas or beliefs that were vital to us as well as ? to them . If we let them fight our battles , something spiritual would happen to us . " Mrs. Bromley said she made the correction in the form , " if we felt we had something at stake in Europe . " Since Mrs. Roosevelt did not delete the words beginning " if war came in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dues that Mrs. Roosevelt was referring " specifically to our participation in the coming war in Europe . " Although Mrs. Roosevelt said at the press conference she had not talked with Mrs. Bromley about American participation in the present war but about the conditions under which nations generally might go to war without referring to any particular nation , Mrs. Bromley pointed out that " in her letter to me she frankly wrote in the first person plural , using the words ? ' our people , ' if we were convinced , ' ideas . . to us , ' if we let others fight our battles , something spiritual would happen to us. ' "
