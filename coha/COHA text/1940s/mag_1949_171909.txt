Two Blind Mice ( by Samuel Spewack ; produced by Archer King &; Harrison Woodhull ) launches a highly farcical broadside against Washington bureaucracy . The scene is the Office of Medicinal Herbs-a bureau which has been legally abolished about five years before the curtain rises . But , by some paperwork slipup , it was never actually killed off . Two old ladies ( well played by Mabel Paige and Laura Pierpont ) are still puttering about in it , carefully burning their paychecks and , for income , renting department space to a rumba teacher and a pants-presser . When a prankish newspaperman ( played with aplomb by Melvyn Douglas ) stumbles on this setup , he proceeds to set it up in style , hoaxes Army , Navy and State Department into imagining that it is big hush-hush stuff , involved in herbal warfare . <P> In approach , Two Blind Mice is far more insane than incisive ; in essence , it is standard farcical canned goods . Exceedingly amusing in spots , it is also exceedingly spotty . The point about the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop spinning ; its pace is its fortune . If it slows up , or even begins to make sense , it has trouble . <P> Two Blind Mice has trouble , by leaning heavily on that shakiest of farce props , the telephone ; by including that flattest of farce ingredients , a love story ; by having to face that grimmest of farce demands , unscrambling the joke . And the joke itself makes a better joke than it does a three-act play .
