txt A great , urgent , nation-wide rubber scrap experiment is about to start  --  to see whether baby 's bottle nipples , old rubber heels , lawn hose , hot water bottles , anything at all with old rubber in it , can be used to get more rubber . That has never been done in this country . We have reclaimed used rubber only from tires and tubes . But the need is getting suddenly bitter : You can start saving the rubber junk with a reasonable outlook of helping . The resulting rubber , however , will not get back to you . Every pound will go to aid our troops or our allies ' soldiers . The situation , as of this week , is that the nation 's stock pile of natural rubber is down to about 460,000 tons , due to war 's huge drains . That figure is low . It is less than one year 's peacetime U. S. rubber use . Add to that the fact that it takes about 40 per cent natural rubber added to the synthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that our synthetic rubber for war alone apparently will have to go to nearly 1,000,000 tons a year . Going to Junk Heap So we are going to the junk heap , and more than that , we are going to scrape together a rubber junk heap the like of which never has existed in our country , Just what will be found , nobody knows . Last year the re claimed rubber , from tires and tubes , was nearly 300,000 tons . But already the source has dwindled to the point where the reclaim factories will have to close by midsummer unless something is done . There still are a lot of old tires and tubes , some hoarded by canny persons who expect a price rise . A drive will bring out more , but not enough . So save that bottle stopper . What can be made out of scrap rubber ? Nearly everything that can be made of fresh natural rubber . For years the public has been using many articles made of anywhere from 50 to nearly 100 per cent reclaimed rubber , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it loses its stretch , life , strength and reclaim value ? Used tires and tubes are good for reclaim after five years , and probably much longer . The period of their life depends on exposure to light and tension . The other articles now to be tried are unpredictable . Score few probably will be useful after years of service , others almost worthless . Stands Exposure Can any chemical be added to reclaimed rubber to restore its newness ? No , but in some respects reclaimed rubber is better than fresh rubber . It stands exposure to light and to weather better . How often can rubber be repocessed before losing its last useful resiliency ? Again no one knows , because we never have had to try . The Bureau of Industrial Conservation , Washington , has organized the 48 States . A further organization is planned in each town and city . The purpose is to collect junk , which means both metal and rubber . The work Is to be done by the junk dealers , renamed scrap brokers . Volunteer work in some communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that something more is needed . An effort is under way to get the Reconstruction Finance Commission to subsidize the scrap brokers so that they will not lose money .
