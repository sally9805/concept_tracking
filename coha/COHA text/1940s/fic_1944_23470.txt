Wing Commander Roald Dahl of the R. A.F . a veteran of the Greek and Syrian campaigns , has been writing for American magazines since his arrival in this country in 1942 . BEWARE OF THE DOG A Story ROALD DAHL OWN below there was only a vast white undulating sea of cloud . Above there was the sun , and the sun was white like the clouds , because it is never yellow when one looks at it from high in the air . - He was still flying the Spitfire . His right hand was on the stick , and he was working the rudder bar with his left leg alone . It was quite easy . The machine was flying well , and he knew what he was doing . " Everything is fine , " he thought . " I 'm doing all right . I 'm doing nicely . I know my way home . I 'll be there in half an hour . When I land I shall taxi in and switch off my engine and I shall say , ' Help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall make my voice sound ordinary and natural and none of them will take any notice . Then I shall say , ' Someone help me to get out . I ca n't do it alone because I 've lost one of my legs . ' They 'll all laugh and think that I 'm joking , and I shall say , ' All right , come and have a look , you unbelieving bastards . ' Then Yorky will climb up onto the wing and look inside . He 'll probably be sick because of all the blood and the mess . I shall laugh and say Tor God 's sake , help me out . ' " He glanced down again at his right leg . There was not much of it left . The cannon shell had taken him on the thigh , justabove the knee , and now there was nothing but a great mess and a lot of blood . But there was no pain . When he looked down , he felt as though he were seeing something that did not belong to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a mess which happened to be there in the cockpit ; something strange and unusual and rather interesting . It was like finding a dead cat on the sofa . He really felt fine , and because he still felt fine , he felt excited and unafraid . " I wo n't even bother to call up on the radio for the blood-wagon , " he thought . " It is n't necessary . And when I land I 'll sit there quite normally and say , ' Some of you fellows come and help me out , will you , because I 've lost one of my legs . ' That will be funny . I 'll laugh a little while I 'm saying it ; I 'll say it calmly and slowly , and they 'll think I 'm joking . When Yorky comes up onto the wing and gets sick , say , Yorky , you old son of a bitch , have you fixed my car yet ? ' Then when I get out I 'll make my report , and later I 'll go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me and I 'll give it to Gluey . We 'll sit in her room and drink it . I 'll get the water out of the bathroom tap . I wo n't say much until it 's time to go to bed , then I 'll say , Gluey , I 've got a surprise for you . I lost a leg today . But I do n't mind so long as you do n't . It does n't even hurt . ' We 'll go everywhere in cars . I always hated walking , except when I walked down the Street of the Coppersmiths in Bagdad , but I could go in a ricksha . I could go home and chop wood , but the head always flies off the axe . Hot water , that 's what it needs ; put it in the bath and make the handle swell . I chopped lots of wood last time I went home , and I put the axe in the bath . .. . " Then he saw the sun shining on the engine cowling of his machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he remembered where he was . He realized that he was no longer feeling good ; that he was sick and giddy . His head kept falling forward onto his chest because his neck seemed no longer to have any strength . But he knew that he was flying the Spitfire , and he could feet the handle of the stick between the fingers of his right hand . " I 'm going to pass out , " he thought . " Any moment now I 'm going to pass out . " He looked at his altimeter . Twenty-one thousand . To test himself he tried to read the hundreds as well as the thousands . Twenty-one thousand and what ? As he looked the dial became blurred , and he could not even see the needle . He knew then that he must bail out ; that there was not a second to lose , otherwise he would become unconscious . Quickly , frantically , he tried to slide back the hood with his Ieft hand , but he had not the strength . For a second he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands he managed to push it back . The rush of cold air on his face seemed to help . He had a moment of great clearness , and his actions became orderly and precise . That is what happens with a good pilot . He took some quick deep breaths from his oxygen mask , and as he did so , he looked out over the side of the cockpit . Down below there was only a vast white sea of cloud , and he realized that he did not know where he was . " It 'll be the Channel , " he thought . " I 'm sure to fall in the drink . " He throttled back , pulled off his helmet , undid his straps , and pushed the stick hard over to the left . The Spitfire dipped its port wing and turned smoothly over onto its back . The pilot fell out . A HE fell he opened his eyes , because he knew that he must not pass out before he had pulled the cord . On one side he saw the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds ; and as he fell , as he somersaulted in the air , the white clouds chased the sun and the sun chased the clouds . They chased each other in a small circle ; they ran faster and faster , and there was the sun and the clouds and the clouds and the sun , and the clouds came nearer until suddenly there was no longer any sun but only a great whiteness . The whole world was white , and there was nothing in it . It was so white that sometimes it looked black , and after a time it was either white or black , but mostly it was white . He watched it as it turned from white to black , and then back to white again , and the white stayed for a long time , but the black lasted for only a few seconds . He got into the habit of going to sleep during the white periods , and of waking up just in time to see the world when it was black . But the black was very quick . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light and switching it on again at once , and so whenever it was white , he dozed off . O NE day , when it was white , he put out a hand and he touched something . He took it between his fingers and crumpled it . For a time he lay there , idly letting the tips of his fingers play with the thing which they had touched . Then slowly he opened his eyes , looked down at his hand , and saw that he was holding something which was white . It was the edge of a sheet . He knew it was a sheet because he could see the texture of the material and the stitchings on the hem . He screwed up his eyes , and opened them again quickly . This time he saw the room . He saw the bed in which he was lying ; he saw the gray walls and the door and the green curtains over the window . There were some roses on the table by his bed . Then he saw the basin on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and beside it there was a small medicine glass . " This is a hospital , " he thought . " I am in a hospital . " But he could remem-ber nothing . He lay back on his pillow , looking at the ceiling and wondering what had happened . He was gazing at the smooth grayness of the ceiling which was so clean and gray , and then suddenly he saw a fly walking upon it . The sight of this fly , the suddenness of seeing this small black speck on a sea of gray , brushed the surface of his brain , and quickly , in that second , he remembered everything . He remembered the Spitfire and he remembered the altimeter showing twenty-one thousand feet . He remembered the pushing back of the hood with both hands and he remembered the bailing out . He remembered his leg . It seemed all right now . He looked down at the end of the bed , but he could not tell . He put one hand underneath the bedclothes and felt for his knees . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other his hand touched something which was soft and covered in bandages . Just then the door opened and a nurse came in . " Hallo , " she said . " So you 've woken up at last . " She was not good-looking , but she was large and clean . She was between thirty and forty and she had fair hair . More than that he did not notice . " Where am I ? " " You 're a lucky fellow . You landed in a wood near the beach . You 're in Brighton . They brought you in two days ago , and now you 're all fixed up . You look fine . " " I 've lost a leg , " he said . " That 's nothing . We 'll get you another one . Now you must go to sleep . The doctor will be coming to see you in about an hour . " She picked up the basin and the medicine glass and went out . But he did not sleep . He wanted to keep his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again everything would go away . He lay looking at the ceiling . The fly was still there . It was very energetic . It would run forward very fast for a few inches , then it would stop . Then it would run forward again , stop , run forward , stop , and every now and then it would take off and buzz around viciously in small circles . It always landed back in the same place on theceiling and started running and stopping all over again . He watched it for so long that after a while it was no longer a fly , but only a black speck upon a sea of gray , and he was still watching it when the nurse opened the door and stood aside while the doctor came in . He was an army doctor , a major , and he had some Iast-war ribbons on his chest . He was bald and small , but he had a cheerful face and kind eyes . " Well , well , " he said . " So you 've decided to wake up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel all right . " " That 's the stuff . You 'll be up and about in no time . " The doctor took his wrist to feel his pulse . " By the way , " he said , " some of the lads from your squadron were ringing up and asking about you . They wanted to come along and see you , but I said that they 'd better wait a day or two . Told them you were all right , and that they could come and see you a little later on . Just lie quiet and take it easy for a bit . Got something to read ? " He glanced at the table with the roses . " No . Weil , nurse will look after you . She 'll get you anything you want . " With that he waved his hand and went out , followed by the large clean nurse . W HEN they had gone , he lay back and looked at the ceiling again . The fly was still there and as he lay watching it he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He lay listening to the sound of its engines . It was a long way away . " I wonder what it is , " he thought . " Let me see if I can place it . " Suddenly he jerked his head sharply to one side . Anyone who has been bombed can tell the noise of a Junkers 88 . He can tell most other German bombers , for that matter , but especially a Junkers 88 . The engines seem to sing a duet . There is a deep vibrating bass voice and with it there is a high-pitched tenor . It is the singing of the tenor which makes the sound of a Ju. 88 something which one can not mistake . He lay listening to the noise , and he felt quite certain about what it was . But where were the sirens , and where the guns ? That German pilot certainly had a nerve coming near Brighton alone in daylight . The aircraft was always far away , and soon the noise faded into the distance . Later on there was another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was the same deep undulating bass and the high singing tenor , and there was no mistaking it . He had heard that noise every day during the Battle . He was puzzled . There was a bell on the table by the bed . He reached out his hand and rang it . He heard the noise of footsteps down the corridor , and the nurse came in . " Nurse , what were those airplanes ? " " I 'm sure I do n't know . I did n't hear them . Probably fighters or bombers . I expect they were returning from France . Why , what 's the matter ? " " They were Ju. 88 's . I 'm sure they were Ju. 88 's . I know the sound of the engines . There were two of them . What were they doing over here ? " The nurse came up to the side of his bed and began to straighten out the sheets and tuck them in under the mattress . " Gracious me , what things you imagine . You must n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to get you something to read ? " " No , thank you . " She patted his pillow and brushed back the hair from his forehead with her hand . " They never come over in daylight any longer . You know that . They were probably Lancasters or Flying Fortresses . " " Nurse . " , szes.3 , " Could I have a cigarette ? " " Why certainly you can . " She went out and came back again almost at once with a packet of Players and some matches . She handed one to him and when he had put it in his mouth , she struck a match and lit it . " If you want me again , " she said , " just ring the bell , " and she went out . Once toward evening he heard the noise of another aircraft . It was far away , but even so he knew that it was a single-engined machine . But he could not place it . It was going fast ; he could tell that . But it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not sound like an American engine either . They make more noise . He did not know what it was , and it wortied him greatly . " Perhaps I am very ill , " he thought . " Perhaps I am imagining things . Perhaps I am a little delirious . I simply do not know what to think . " PPHAT evening the nurse came in with a . II . basin of hot water and began to wash him . " Well , " she said , " I hope you do n't think that we 're being bombed . " She had taken off his pajama top and was soaping his right arm with a flannel . He did not answer . She rinsed the flannel in the water , rubbed more soap on it , and began to wash his chest . " You 're looking fine this evening , " she said . " They operated on you as soon as you came in . They did a marvelous job . You 'll be all right . I 've got a brother in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He said , " I went to school in Brighton . " She looked up quickly . " Well , that 's fine , " she said . " I expect you 'll know some people in the town . " " Yes , " he said , " I know quite a few . " She had finished washing his chest and arms , and now she turned back the bedclothes , so that his left leg was uncovered . She did it in such a way that his bandaged stump remained under the sheets . She undid the cord of his pajama trousers and took them off . There was no trouble because they had cut off the right trouser leg , so that it could not interfere with the bandages . She began to wash his Ieft leg and the rest of his body . This was the first time that he had had a bed bath , and he was embarrassed . She laid a towel under his leg , and she was washing his foot with the flannel . She said , " This wretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . It 's as hard as nails . " He said , " None of the soap is very good now , and of course with hard water it 's hopeless . " As he said it he remembered something . He remembered the baths which he used to take at school in Brighton , in the long stone-floored bathroom which had four baths in a room . He remembered how the water was so soft that you had to take a shower afterwards to get all the soap off your body , and he remembered how the foam used to float on the surface of the water , so that you could not see your legs underneath . He remembered that sometimes they were given calcium tablets because the school doctor used to say that soft water was bad for the teeth . " In Brighton , " he said , " the water is n't . . . " He did not finish the sentence . Something had occurred to him ; something so fantastic and absurd that for a moment he felt like telling the nurse about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The water is n't what ? " she said . " Nothing , " he answered . " I was dreaming . " She rinsed the flannel in the basin , wiped the soap off his leg , and dried him with a towel . " It 's nice to be washed , " he said . feel better . " He was feeling his face with his hand . " I need a shave . " " We 'll do that tomorrow , " she said . " Perhaps you can do it yourself then . " That night he could not sleep . He lay awake thinking of the Junkers 88 's and of the hardness of the water . He could think of nothing else . " They were Ju. 88 's , " he said . " I know they were . And yet it is n't possible , because they would n't be flying around so low over here in broad daylight . I know it is true , and yet I know it is impossible . Perhaps I am ill . Perhaps I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am doing or saying . Perhaps I am delirious . " For a long time he lay awake thinking these things , and once he sat up in bed and said aloud , " I will prove I 'm not crazy . I will make a little speech about something complicated and intellectual . I will talk about what to do with Germany after the war . " But before he had time to begin , he was asleep . FI E WOKE just as the first light of day was showing through the slit in the curtains over the window . The room was still dark , but he could tell that it was already beginning to get light outside . He lay looking at the gray light which was showing through the slit in the curtain , and as he lay there he remembered the day before . He remembered the Junkers 88'sand the hardness of the water ; he remembered the large pleasant nurse and the kind doctor , and now the small grain of doubt took root in his mind and it began to grow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roses out the night before , and there was nothing except the table with a packet of cigarettes , a box of matches , and an ash tray . Otherwise it was bare . It was no longer warm or friendly . It was not even comfortable . It was cold and empty and very quiet . Slowly the grain of doubt grew , and with it came fear , a light , dancing fear that warned but did not frighten ; the kind of fear that one gets not because one is afraid , but because one feels that there is something wrong . Quickly the doubt and the fear grew so that he became restless and angry , and when he touched his forehead with his hand he found that it was damp with sweat . He knew then that he must do something ; that he must find some way of proving to himself that he was either right or wrong , and he looked up and saw again the window and the green curtains . From where he lay , that window was right in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Somehow he must reach it and look out . The idea became an obsession with him , and soon he could think of nothing except the window . But what about his leg ? He put his hand underneath the bedclothes and felt the thick bandaged stump which was all that was left on the right-hand side . It seemed all right . It did n't hurt . But it would not be easy . He sat up . Then he pushed the bedclothes aside and put his left leg on the floor . Slowly , carefully , he swung his body over until he had both hands on the floor as well ; and then he was out of bed , kneeling on the carpet . He looked at the stump . It was very short and thick , covered with bandages . It was beginning to hurt and he could feel it throbbing . Suddenly he wanted to collapse , lie down on the carpet and do nothing , but he knew that he must go on . With two arms and one leg , he crawled over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he could with his arms , then he would give a little jump and slide his left kg along after them . Each time he did it , it jarred his wound so that he gave a soft grunt of pain , but he continued to crawl across the floor on two hands and one knee . When he got to the window he reached up , and one at a time he placed both hands on the sill . Slowly he raised himself up until he was standing on his left leg . Then quickly he pushed aside the curtains and looked out . He saw a small house with a gray tiled roof standing alone beside a narrow lane , and immediately behind it there was a plowed field . In front of the house there was an untidy gardcn , and there was a green hedge separating the garden from the lane . He was looking at the hedge when he saw the sign . It was just a piece of board nailed to the top of a short pole , and because the hedge had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown out around the sign so that it seemed almost as though it had been placed in the middle of the hedge . There was something written on the board with white paint , and he pressed his head against the glass of the window , trying to read what it said . The first letter was a G , he could see that . The second was an A , and the third was an R. One after another he managed to see what they were . There were three words , and slowly he spelled the letters out aloud to himself as he managed to read them . G-A-R-D-E A-U C-H-I-E-N . Garde au chien . That is what it said . He stood there balancing on one Ieg and holding tightly to the edges of the window sill with his hands , staring at the sign and at the whitewashed lettering of the words . For a moment he could think of nothing at all . He stood there looking at the sign , repeating the words over and over to himself , and then slowly he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up at the cottage and at the plowed field . He looked at the small orchard on the left of the cottage and he looked at the green countryside beyond . " So this is France , " he said . " I am in France . " Now the throbbing in his right thigh was very great . It felt as though someone were pounding the end of his stump with a hammer , and suddenly the pain became so intense that it affected his head and for a moment he thought he was going to fall . Quickly he knelt down again , crawled back to the bed , and hoisted himself in . He pulled the bedclothes over himself and lay back on the pillow , exhausted . He could still think of nothing at all except the small sign by the hedge , and the plowed field and the orchard . It was the words on the sign that he could not forget . IT WAS some time before the nurse came IL in . She came carrying a basin of hot water and she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He said , " Good morning , nurse . " The pain was still great under the bandages , but he did not wish to tell this woman anything . He looked at her as she busied herself with getting the washing things ready . He looked at her more carefully now . Her hair was very fair . She was tall and big-boned , and her face seemed pleasant . But there was something a little uneasy about her eyes . They were never still . They never looked at anything for more than a moment and they moved too quickly from one place to another in the room . There was something about her movements also . They were too sharp and nervous to go well with the casual manner in which she spoke . She set down the basin , took off his pajama top , and began to wash him . " Did you sleep well ? " " Yes . " " Good , " she said . She was washing his arms and his chest . " 1 believe there 's someone coming down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she went on . " They want a report or something . I expect you know all about it . How you got shot down and all that . I wo n't let him stay long , so do n't worry . " He did not answer . She finished washing him , and gave him a toothbrush and some tooth powder . He brushed his teeth , rinsed his mouth , and spat the water out into the basin . Later she brought him his breakfast on a tray , but he did not want to eat . He was still feeling weak and sick , and he wished only to lie still and think about what had happened . And there was a sentence running through his head . It was a sentence which Johnny , the intelligence officer of his squadron , always repeated to the pilots every day before they went out . He could see Johnny now , leaning against the wall of the dispersal but with his pipe in his hand , saying , " And if they get you , do n't forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing else . For God 's sake , say nothing else . " " There you are , " she said as she put the tray on his lap . " I 've got you an egg . Can you manage all right ? " " Yes . " She stood beside the bed . " Are you feeling all right ? " " Yes . " " Good . If you want another egg I might be able to get you one . " " This is all right . " " Well , just ring the bell if you want any more . " And she went out . He had just finished eating when the nurse came in again . She said , " Wing Commander Roberts is here . I 've told him that he can only stay for a few minutes . " She beckoned with her hand and the Wing Commander came in . " Sorry to bother you like this , " he said . He was an ordinary R.A.F. officer , dressed in a uniform which was a little shabby , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thin with plenty of black hair . His teeth , which were irregular and widely spaced , stuck out a little even when he closed his mouth . As he spoke he took a printed form and a pencil from his pocket , and he pulled up a chair and sat down . " How are you feeling ? " There was no answer . " Tough Iuck about your leg . I know how you feel . I hear you put up a fine show before they got you . " The man in the bed was lying quite still , watching the man in the chair . The man in the chair said , " Well , let 's get this stuff over . I 'm afraid you 'll have to answer a few questions so that I can fill in this combat report . Let me see now , first of all , what was your squadron ? " The man in the bed did not move . He looked straight at the Wing Commander and he said , " My name is Peter Williamson . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two four five seven . " ,
