Monday quarterbacks have been regretting that Eisenhower 's armies did not attack Hitler through the Balkans instead of in France . Had the Western powers occupied southeastern Europe , containment of Russia would now be that much farther along . The fact is forgotten that by stabbing as they did , directly at the heart of Hitler 's power , the West got a prize far more important than the Balkans . It got the Ruhr . <P> Until last week , however , the West made little serious effort to use the Ruhr for what it was-the key to Europe 's recovery , the key to control of Europe . First the British alone occupied it , although they did not have the resources needed to get it going again . Then it was brought into the joint U.S.-British economic administration called Bizonia . The French refused to enter any arrangements for the rehabilitation of the Ruhr , because they wanted assurance that the area would be separated from Germany and placed under international political control . Britain and the U.S. knew that this would not work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old India Office in London , the logjam broke after ten days of hard-driving pressure , stepped up by the Czech crisis . The Big Three of the West ( the U.S. , Britain and France ) began the conference with a sensible and long-delayed step-admission of the Little Three ( Belgium , The Netherlands , Luxemburg ) . The Benelux countries depend so closely on German industry that they insisted on a settlement . France yielded along the logical lines of compromise . The agreement in principle looks toward a Ruhr that will be politically part of Germany , but an international control of its economy will see that its products are available for Western Europe 's needs . <P> There were other tentative agreements . The U.S. , Great Britain and France would dovetail the economies of their occupation zones in Western Germany . A federal government , protecting states ' rights but allowing for " adequate central control , " was proposed as the best ultimate form of rule for a unified Germany . These agreements will be translated into specific clauses at another conference in April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative unit , Trizonia ; it will control 69% of Germany 's population , a higher proportion of its industrial plant . <P> The Coal Comes Up . Meanwhile , more sensible occupation policies , including incentive rations , have been stepping up Ruhr production of the coal all Europe needs . A year ago coal production was running at about 235,000 tons a day . One day last week it hit a postwar high- 291,000 tons . The area that used to produce 22% of all the coal and 31% of all the steel in Europe was going to work for peace .
