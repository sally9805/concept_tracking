REFLECTIONS ON THE REVOLUTION OF OUR TIME - Harold J. Laski-Viking ( $3.50 ) . <P> We are in the midst of a period of revolutionary change that is likely to be as profound as any in the modern history of the human race . We shall not understand its inner nature unless we recognize it to be as significant in its essentials as that which saw the fall of the Roman Empire . . . . <P> Victory will not change the outlook . Professor Laski prophesies . The war 's end will find the American industrial machine enormously expanded and in danger of remaining unused for lack of effective demand . And Socialist Laski jumps to the conclusion that , if this machine remains in private hands , the movement toward an American imperialism will be swift . World War II is a battle against counterrevolution , a battle in which the collapse of Hitler and Mussolini will mean no more than the end of an important stage in clearing the decks for a new society . <P> Says Laski , there is a single , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a repetition at home of the bloody Russian revolution , with its aftermath of suffering and repression . Violence there will be , but it is equally likely to come from the ruling classes of Britain and the U.S. as from leftist revolutionaries . <P> Black and Red . Harold Laski , prominent in the British Labor Party , representative of a small , intellectually influential section of British socialism , an enthusiastic advocate of state planning , sets down this ghastly prospect at length , and in an audacious style well suited to the foreboding of his thoughts . This book ( his 20th ) is as rich in controversy as it is sweeping in its outlook . Its dark alternatives strike the essential optimism of the American mind with considerable force . <P> Twenty-three years ago the Harvard Lampoon turned against Laski one of the most violent attacks ever directed against a faculty member in America . However much that first experience formed his views of the U.S. , Harold Laski has not since then seen American life in brighter colors than black and red . This brilliant son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his schooldays , with his radical views hardened by Oxford 's snobbishness ( " It was the first experience I had of the intensity of class division in England " ) , began his career writing editorials for Labor 's Daily Herald . In World War I he was rejected for military service . His stormy visits to the U.S. , his bitter criticisms of Republican administrations , his standing as an authority on America in Britain and on Britain in America , the force with which he states definitively views that other state planners express obliquely , give him and his works a consequence that his opponents can not ignore .
