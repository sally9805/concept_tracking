Eight stony-faced men sat in Manhattan 's Federal Court last week and heard a veteran blackmailer call them blackmailers . The Government had charged that the eight men ( seven ex-Capone hoodlums and one Newark labor official ) had shaken down the movie industry for $1 million . <P> The Government 's star witness : Shake down Expert Willie Bioff , who was let out of jail to sing on his ex-chums . Dapper , wily Willie , nothing loath , sat calmly in a swivel-chair , hands clasped meditatively over his stomach - and sang . <P> Said Blackmailer Bioff : yes , he knew the defendants well . Seven of them were " The Syndicate " that had helped him filch at least $1 million in union dues , and blackmail the czars of Hollywood on a Hollywood scale . Staring coldly back at Willie Bioff 's fat , pointing finger was an all-star police lineup : Gunman Paul ( " The Waiter " ) de Lucia ; pistol-packing ex-Capone Muscleman Phil D'Andrea ; Beer-war Veteran Charles ( " Cherry-Nose Joy " ) Gioe ; Machine-gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Compagna ; Frank ( " The Immune " ) Maritote , alias Frankie Diamond ; 14-time indicted Ralph Pierce ; John Rosselli and Newark 's Louis Kaufman . <P> For three days Willie Bioff prattled away about the troubles and triumphs of the shakedown industry . His recital not only damaged the defendants , but scorched U.S. workers who tolerate criminal union leadership and Hollywood bigwigs who take orders from the underworld . <P> Open Hands , Cold Feet . Said Willie Bioff to the Court : Back in 1934 he was just a smalltime operator in Chicago labor circles , working with his pal , George E. Browne , ex-president of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employes . ( Both are now serving time for extortion . ) " The Syndicate " took Bioff and Browne over . Thereafter , Chicago movie exhibitors-and finally even the big Hollywood studios-paid heavily and often for the usual " protection " from what was euphemistically called " labor trouble . " <P> Under the bland , long-lashed stare of roly-poly Defendant Louis Compagna , wily Willie Bioff testified : " Compagna came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about resigning . ' Anybody resigns from us resigns feet first , understand ? ' he tells me . So I did n't resign . " <P> If Grandma Must Go . Then the Court got an eyewitness account of Willie 's business with one Jack Miller , labor representative for a group of Chicago movie exhibitors : <P> Bioff : " I told Miller the exhibitors . . . would have to have two operators in each booth . Miller said , ' My God ! That will close up all my shows . ' " <P> Prosecutor : " And what did you say ? " <P> Bioff : " I said : ' If that will kill grandma - then grandma must die . ' . . . Miller said that two men in each booth would cost about $500,000 a year . So I said well , why do n't you make a deal ? And we finally agreed on $60,000 . " <P> Judge John Bright : " What was this $60,000 paid for ? " <P> Bioff ( beaming ) : " Why , Your Honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You see , Judge , if they would n't pay we 'd give them lots of trouble . We 'd put them out of business and I mean out . "
