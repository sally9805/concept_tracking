On the operations-tent bulletin board at a U.S. advanced fighter base in Italy good news was pinned up last week : an official commendation by Army Air Forces ' Chief " Hap " Arnold . Reason for the commendation : the squadron had shot down eight German aircraft in one day , four in another . Score for three days ' missions had totaled twelve kills , two probables , four damaged . <P> Any outfit would have been proud of the record . These victories stamped the final seal of combat excellence on one of the most controversial outfits in the Army , the all-Negro 99th Fighter Squadron ( TIME , Sept. 20 ) . <P> Its pilots had survived disappointments , discouragements and months of routine operations in which they did not even sight an enemy . They had finally got their big chance flying cover for the Allies ' Nettuno beachhead , and they knew what to do with it . <P> Shooting It Out . Wiry Major George Spencer Roberts , * 25-year-old commander of the squadron , pulled at his pipe , told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned , it was just a matter of getting an opportunity and jumping on it . <P> " We have not turned out to be super-duper pilots-but as good as the U.S. Army turns out , " he said . " That 's important . Because we had one handicap : people assumed we were not producing because we were Negroes . Our men have been under a strain because of the civilian attitude . It is remarkable that they kept up their morale . But now that we have produced , things have changed . " <P> Before things changed , the men of the 99th had traveled a long , hard road . Training for the all-Negro squadron had started back in July 1941 . The program was experimental , and suffered accordingly ; there were slights , snubs and delays . The men did their operational training in P-4O Warhawks , were finally organized as a squadron 18 months ago . They went to Africa last spring . <P> At first they showed no signs of setting the Mediterranean on fire : they were too new , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German plane and reported another probable , but two of their own ships were shot down . Some Air Forces officers began to lose what little confidence they had had in the outfit , and reports of mediocrity began turning up in Washington . <P> Sweating It Out . The 99th flew on , through a long series of monotonous missions , bomber escort or fighter-bomber jobs . For six months the men never saw a German plane . But the outfit was pulling itself together , acquiring confidence and smoothness , developing good flight leaders , and piling up combat time . When its chance came again , over Nettuno , the squadron was veteran , well-led , sure of itself . <P> Now the 99th is in , and the men know it . They have the quiet , assured , professional air of any proved combat outfit . They look , talk and act like any other group of airmen with seven months ' combat flying under their belts . Their ground crews are tops ; their maintenance as good as any in the Air Forces . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters and administration . But at Red Cross clubs , movies , officers ' clubs and post exchanges they mingle freely with white soldiers and have felt no particular race consciousness . Said a fellow flyer last week ( a Missourian in a white squadron operating from the same base ) :
