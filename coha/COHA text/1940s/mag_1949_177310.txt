The Riviera had been rocked by U.S. jazz when Louis Armstrong and his cats took over at Nice 's Jazz Festival a year ago ( TIME , March 8 , 1948 ) . Last week , in Cannes ' red plush little Casino theater , the gold plush Riviera set got to hear what longer-haired U.S. musicians were up to . <P> Casino audiences , with Denmark 's Queen Alexandrine , Britain 's Lord Mountbatten and France 's Maurice Chevalier , among others , floating in &; out , had first heard a week of French music , a week of Italian music , and an English week . For the semaine americaine , slim , nervous Conductor Jascha Horenstein was having his troubles . <P> Horns &; Hats . None of the 40 musicians of the Cannes Municipal Orchestra had ever played a single note of modern American symphonic music ; even though Conductor Horenstein found his players " quick-witted and adaptable , " he still had to rehearse them three times a day , between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m . He had waited until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhapsody in Blue to arrive , finally had to phone the U.S. embassy in Paris to borrow another and have it flown down . There were no mutes for the trumpets ; he had to borrow felt hats to be used instead . The Casino 's rosy-faced Artistic Director Georges Mockers , after being sent to find the automobile horns prescribed by Gershwin for his An American in Paris , could n't help sighing : " Ah , ces Americains ! What next ? " <P> No one had to wait long to find out . First on the program was Juilliard President William Schuman 's Symphony for Strings . Riviera critics , hearing it for the first time , found it " purely scientific music , " but noted that " among a sea of dissonances there are hidden some real beauties . " Then they were assaulted by Oklahoma-born Roy Harris ' Third Symphony ; its abrupt ending , with a savage blast from the whole orchestra , left the audience gaping ( muttered the perspiring tympanisf . " For this kind of thing I should have six arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harris ' Third long and generous applause . Not so the critics . Wrote one : " Maybe a bit discouraging to certain ears , but full of brilliant sonority . No doubt the symphony is a beautiful and interesting work of modern music . " <P> Porgy &; Bess . After hearing New Yorker Samuel Barber 's Stravinskyesque Capricorn Concerto , American week finally got around to its triumph . Maurice Ravel had once told George Gershwin , " Do n't you ever try to imitate the Europeans . . . It 's better to write good Gershwin than bad Ravel . " And after hearing some piano preludes , songs from Porgy and Bess and An American in Paris , topped off by a rousing Rhapsody in Blue , Cannes connoisseurs found good Gershwin good enough for them . They let Conductor Horenstein &; Co. know it with six noisy curtain calls . Concluded old Cannes Critic Edouard Berthier : " When you write that kind of music , you do n't have to imitate anybody .
