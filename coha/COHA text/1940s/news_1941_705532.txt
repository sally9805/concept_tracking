txt COST : Immaterial It is beginning to look as if the American policy of " all aid short of war " might be in very truth " all aid short of victory . " The time has come for those who fear for the safety of their sons to consider what kind of a world they are saving their sons to live in . Are they willing to face the possibility , nay , the probability , that if more and increasingly effective aid is not given to Britain at once , and regardless of cost , we of the younger generation must live our lives and rear our children in a world dominated by fear and dedicated to the exhausting pursuit of perpetual defense against a superior military power ? Life is not so dear and peace is not so sweet that America need be afraid to do what is necessary to secure victory for her way of life. ?
