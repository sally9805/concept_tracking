Brooklyn , which is used to fighting words , had a new one : Melish . The battleground was the Protestant Episcopal Church of the Holy Trinity , in fashionable Brooklyn Heights . <P> Holy Trinity 's vestrymen have long looked askance at the sayings &; doings of their ministers , Rector John Howard Melish , 74 , and his son and associate rector , the Rev. William Howard Melish , 38 ( TIME , May 3 ) . Son William , a confirmed Communist-liner , is chairman of the Red-fronting National Council of American-Soviet Friendship , and has been associated with at least six other organizations listed as subversive by the Attorney General 's office . His father not only tolerates his assistant 's political activities , but once referred to them as " the work which the rector himself would have done had he been 20 years younger . " When such work included inviting England 's celebrated " Red Dean " of Canterbury to preach at Holy Trinity , anti-Melish parishioners were not reassured . <P> As Consciences Demand . At last , the vestrymen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 to 1 to petition Long Island 's Bishop James Pernette De Wolfe " for separation and dissolution of the pastoral relationship . . . " But spry old Rector Melish was not one to go quietly . He wrote to his congregation telling what the vestry had done . <P> In reply , the vestry got out another letter presenting its version of the situation . They had been " informed , " said the vestrymen , that " it was the unanimous recommendation of the Bishop and the Standing Committee that . . . it would be for the best interests of the Parish and the Diocese if both the Rector and the Assistant Minister resigned . " <P> Last week the battle was in full swing . A " Committee to Retain Our Rector " was busy ringing the doorbells of Holy Trinity 's 400-odd voting members , claimed to have 270 signatures already . Though not necessarily agreeing with the Melish political views , the committee 's statement said : " We all do agree . . . that they have a right , as we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to engage in such activities , as citizens or as ministers , as their consciences demand . " <P> The Basic Question ? The conservative Episcopal weekly , the Living Church , editorialized : " Are there any limits upon the right of a clergyman to engage in political action ? Yes , we think there are ; because his main duty is to teach the Christian religion . . . The basic question . . . is not freedom of speech . . . but the spiritual health and welfare of the congregation . " The leftist Churchman fulminated against " the fear-ridden vestry . " With a perfectly straight face , the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship expressed its " amazement " and " shock . " <P> This week , while the Melishes consulted their lawyers , Bishop De Wolfe prepared , as provided by canon law , to render " his Godly judgment . "
