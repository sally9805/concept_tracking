Because of its heavy losses ( TIME , Jan. 24 ) , Farnsworth stock , which had hit a high of 11 a year ago , was slipping steadily . <P> Last week International Telephone &; Telegraph Corp . and Farnsworth officials helped kick it farther down the ladder . I.T . &; T. had agreed to buy Farnsworth through an exchange of stock , one share of I.T . &; T. for twelve of Farnsworth . Since I.T . &; T. was selling for $9.25 and Farnsworth for $2.87 , the deal meant that Farnsworth 's trade-in value was only about 77 a share . That touched off a selling wave . <P> In the next two days , Farnsworth led the big board in the number of shares traded , and dropped to 1 ? . At week 's end , Farnsworth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had known about it could have-and may well have-cleaned up by selling Farnsworth short . The SEC was " looking into the matter .
