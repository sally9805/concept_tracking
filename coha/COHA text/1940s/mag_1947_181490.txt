The Devil 's Envoys ( Paulv ; Superfilm ) , which is based on the medieval romance Les Visiteurs du Soir , is a French film about a minstrel ( Alain Cuny ) and his mistress ( Arletty ) who travels disguised as his brother . One evening they turn up among the entertainers at a small French chateau . These unusually talented musicians are capable of magic , as well as music ; they are emissaries of the Devil ( Jules Berry ) . Their business in the world is to seduce immortal souls through the transient flesh . <P> The minstrel goes to work on the baron 's lovely daughter and becomes entangled in his own toils . His " brother , " sticking more faithfully to duty , reveals her sex both to the devout Baron ( Ledoux ) and to his worldly prospective son-in-law . When the plot gets too complicated , the Devil himself turns up , disguised as a very nasty gentleman , and complicates matters still further . Arletty 's lovers are certified for Hell ; but Hell 's unfaithful minstrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ True Love , fight the Devil to a draw . <P> This odd movie is the work of Jacques Prevert and Marcel Carn , who made Children of Paradise ( TIME , Nov. 25 ) . Of its fairly unprecedented kind-it is a classical medieval romance on film-it is close to perfection . But it seems unlikely that many U.S. moviegoers will care for it as much as the French critics who voted it the best French film of 1943 . <P> Most of it is beautiful to look at , rather like tapestry turned into slow-motion ballet ; but beauty on film , when there is too much of it and too little else , can get pretty dull . Not even the talented , magnificent-looking cast can bring much of the film to life . There is a lot of engaging magic , but that , too , loses its appeal ; there is too little sense of real life by which to measure its wonder . The picture is saturated in a kind of allegorized romanticism that is curiously musty . There are moments when the film almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience . But enchantment is closely related to sleep ; all in all , sleep is what this exquisitely contrived but rather precious film is likelier to induce . <P> The Romance of Rosy Ridge ( MGM ) presents Van Johnson as a plumpish Barefoot Boy who wanders into Missouri 's Ozarks and settles down with some folks named MacBean to help with the harvesting . Besides being useful around the house and barnyard , Van is quite a man with the mouth organ , the banjo , his larynx , and the ladies . <P> Maw MacBean ( Selena Royle ) is glad to have Van around , and young Lissy ( Janet Leigh ) makes eyes enough for a whole county 's quota of farmers ' daughters . Gill MacBean ( Thomas Mitchell ) is less easily won over by the stranger . The Civil War has just been fought , and feeling still runs high . Barns are being burned by masked riders ; Yankees and ex-Rebels still wo n't help each other out with the crops , or even keep their tempers at a party . Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question : Are the stranger 's britches blue or gray ? <P> The stranger , who feels that the war is over now and that people should be sociable again , irritatingly insists on wearing enigmatic checkered pants . At last his hideous secret comes out : he was not only a Union soldier , but a schoolmaster to boot . Ultimately , of course , he unmasks the barn-burners , pacifies MacBean , and gets the girl .
