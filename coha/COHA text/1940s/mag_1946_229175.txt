On a crisp , sunny day Frenchmen last week reluctantly adopted their 14th Constitution-a tripartite compromise draft neither rightist fish nor leftist fowl-rather than heed the adamantine voice of General Charles de Gaulle . Final score : 9,126,370-to-8,043,366 ( complete except for a few overseas votes ) . Explained a Paris shopkeeper : <P> " We ca n't go on voting for constitutions forever . It is evident this Assembly ca n't produce a better one , so there 's no use sending it back for more doctoring . De Gaulle will probably be proved right . . . but we have got to get on to other business . " <P> Thirty percent of the French , weary of repeated voting , did not go to the polls . But enough followed the " Liberator " to give France 's largest political party , the <P> Catholic Centrist M.R.P. , and its leader , President Georges Bidault , a resounding slap . Only one-third of its members voted for the Constitution the party had cosponsored . The Socialists also were divided , but the Communists , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of 93 departments rejected the Constitution . It was adopted in such leftist strongholds as Marseilles and Lille , voted down in the rightist bastions of Paris , Bordeaux , Strasbourg . <P> Aloof Charles de Gaulle could claim at least a half victory . The vote showed that he could not buck the coalition , but he had emerged the largest single influence in France , larger than any one party . Frenchmen wondered if De Gaulle would accept ( if offered ) a presidency which , as set up in the new constitution , he considered weak and ineffectual . <P> With one fight over , Frenchmen at week 's end had plunged into another four weeks of vigorous campaigning . Next month they would choose regular deputies to the new Assembly and Council of the Republic .
