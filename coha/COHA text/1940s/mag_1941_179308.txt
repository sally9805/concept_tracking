John Cudahy , ex-Ambassador to Belgium , believes Franklin Roosevelt ought to keep the U.S. out of war-and will . Last week , out of a deep sincerity , John Cudahy took to the radio and said so . <P> But John Cudahy is not to be confused with the standard-variety of Republican isolationists and Roosevelt-baiters . First , because he roundly denounces the Nazis . Said he last week : the Hitler regime is " the most heartless imperialism since man emerged from the slime of barbarism . " Second , John Cudahy is not just for sitting back and doing nothing . Last week he called upon the President to propose " an American program of peace " based on " an international government with power to enforce the solution of this and all the endless wars in Europe . " Back of such a proposal John Cudahy is prepared to place " the moral prestige and force of America . "
