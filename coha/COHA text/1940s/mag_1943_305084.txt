When Parasitologist Ernest Carroll Faust took over Tulane 's Tropical Medicine Department in 1938 , it consisted of himself and two assistants . In 1941 the Rockefeller Foundation , mindful of the epidemic threats of global war , gave it $200,000 . With this money and contributions from the American Foundation for Tropical Medicine , Inc. , Eli Lilly Co. et al. , a full-size school is now in the making . <P> Last week its faculty of eight was working overtime , with 258 undergraduates and a constantly varying number of postgraduates . The fear that inspired this activity is that U.S. citizens , returning from far-off fronts , may bring home a host of new , dangerous or repulsive diseases . Among the less familiar ones : African sleeping sickness , relapsing fever ( a periodic fever transmitted by bedbugs ) , schistosomiasis , onchocerciasis , trypanosomiasis ( all three , parasitic infestations ) , yaws ( a type of stubborn skin sore indigenous to the tropics ) . Says Dr. Faust : fortunately , most tropical epidemics are " not like flash floods , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ample time for tightened safeguards . " In Dr. Faust 's opinion the three diseases that need most watching are : <P> &gt; Tropical malaria ( full name : malignant tertian malaria ) , the most deadly form of the disease ( TIME , Feb. 1 ) . Right now , U.S. mosquitoes are free of it . <P> &gt;Filariasis , a worm infestation , not usually deadly , but bad for morale . Some marines in Samoa got it . In a man 's blood , the filariae become very slim worms from one to two inches long , may do little harm ; but if they plug lymph-gland ducts , may cause elephantiasis ( huge swellings ) in scrotum or legs . For some unknown reason the filariae rarely appear in the circulating blood except between the hours of 9 p.m. and 2 a.m . The larvae are carried by ordinary U.S. mosquitoes . As there is no cure for the disease , the only recourse is mosquito control . The only U.S. area infected at present is Charleston , S.C . <P> &gt; Amoebic dysentery . Men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they are food handlers , cause many outbreaks . <P> Good Neighbor Doctors . Tulane does not claim to be a great research school ( tropical disease research goes on at many Government-financed laboratories ) . Tulane 's chief interest is in preventive tropical medicine . Matter-of-fact Dr. Faust says the first step in protecting the U.S. is to prevent soldiers abroad from getting tropical diseases , the second step is to prevent the diseases from spreading . Most Tulane postgraduates are men strategically placed to do something about tropical-disease prevention : they are either 1 ) Army doctors or 2 ) civilian doctors who teach in other medical schools ( their tuition is paid by the Government ) .
