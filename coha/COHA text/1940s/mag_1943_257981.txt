" Since I shave every blessed day , " Agustin Lara once remarked , " I have long ago learned from my mirror that my face has no business before a camera . But since people have a morbid curiosity about things that do not concern them , a film on my life-no matter how wretchedly done-would be sure to fill the movie houses . " <P> In Mexico City last week movie houses were packed by a wretched distortion of the life of Agustin Lara . Called Noches de Ronda ( " Nights of Revelry " ) , it was a pale , sentimental story of a caf musician 's rise to radio fame . The face in the film was not the pinched , knife-scarred face of Lara , Mexico 's most popular songwriter . The producers had taken one look at that and decided to give the role to the handsome singer Ramn Armengod . But what drew throngs to the box office was Lara 's fantastic personal reputation and that of his 800 fevered , insinuating songs . <P> Lara 's real life would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a spinster aunt , he spent a rather solitary childhood writing poetry and tinkling at the piano . He attended a military school and , before he was 19 , fought with Pancho Villa . Mustered out , he went to Mexico City and began his musical career as a whorehouse pianist .

With a kind of soft , confessional stridency , little hollow-eyed Lara whispers his songs to the women of Mexico . He pictures them in brothels , on their knees beside confessionals , in the arms of lovers , in frustrated spinsterdom . He is by turns caressing and despondent , lunar and neurotic . <P> In actuality , 43-year-old Lara takes a rather objective view of women . He divorced his wife a decade ago and has since lived alone in a luxurious rented house in Mexico City 's suburb of Chapultepec . He affects Byronic collars , horn rimmed harlequin spectacles , and usually looks fatigued . He is proud of a sumptuous gold hand-carved wrist watch given him last New Year 's by President Avila Camacho .
