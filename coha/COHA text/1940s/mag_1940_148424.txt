Lake County , Ill. includes such swank Chicago suburbs as Highland Park , Lake Forest , Deerfield , Barrington . Its biggest city ( pop . 33,499 ) is Waukegan , chiefly famed as Jack Benny 's home town . <P> Until six months ago Lake County had just one staid , old newspaper , the Waukegan News-Sun . Publisher Frank H. Just , bald , stern and 71 , has been a newspaper man for 43 years , and a lifelong foe of gambling . <P> Two years ago ( according to a story Frank Just told Federal investigators ) a lawyer with a little mustache called at the News-Sun office and introduced him self as William Goldstein . Everybody in Chicago knows that Lawyer Goldstein frequently appears as legal counsel for alleged handbook operators in their brief and painless brushes with the law . He is also an attorney for Billy Skidmore , Chicago 's gambling overlord . <P> Frank Just 's story is that Lawyer Goldstein told him Billy Skidmore had bought the Bon Air Country Club , just inside the border of Lake County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for suburban socialites . If the News-Sun would lay off Skidmore 's casino , Publisher Just would find $100,000 on his desk . When Frank Just refused ( he says ) , Lawyer Goldstein threatened to start a rival paper . <P> Publisher Just saw no more of Lawyer Goldstein for a while , and presently he forgot about the visit . Last summer , with his sons , he went off cruising for two months on the Great Lakes . Meanwhile , in Waukegan , a sign went up in a vacant furniture store announcing a new Waukegan daily . <P> One August day Publisher Just got word in Canada that the Bon Air Country Club was open for business and going full blast . Frank Just 's cruiser made the spray fly across Lake Michigan , speeding home to Waukegan . Back at his desk , he sent the News-Sun 's star feature writer , a girl reporter named Gladys Priddy , to see what was going on at the Country Club . <P> A uniformed doorman ushered Gladys and her escort in at the Club 's canopied entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an elaborate floor show was just beginning . Off the lobby was a gaming room with tables for roulette , craps , black jack , high-low . Reporter Priddy recognized some of Lake County 's plumpest dowagers , smartest dbutantes . <P> Next day Publisher Just called in Lake County 's sheriff , showed him what Gladys Priddy had written . That night the sheriff raided the Club , closed the game room , proceeded on a whirlwind tour of Lake County , seizing slot machines and pinball games for good measure . <P> Two weeks later the new Waukegan Post appeared on the street . Only name on the masthead was Frank T. Fowler , listed as director . A onetime Chicago alderman , onetime manager of Waukegan 's chamber of commerce , publisher of another short-lived Waukegan journal , 72-year-old Frank Fowler had been living in Tarpon Springs , Fla. until he came back to take charge of the Post . <P> Once more the News-Sun 's Just went into action , sent photographers to stalk the Post plant . They got what they were after : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers . Next morning Frank Just printed his story of Lawyer Goldstein 's visit to the News-Sun office in 1938 . Chicago papers picked it up . One month later William Goldstein announced himself as Publisher of the Post .
