THERE is a challenging mystery about the career of Endicott Peabody . For more than fifty years he was Head Master of Groton , and during this period it became a matter of great and increasing interest how he did it . Intelligent and expert persons repaired to the School and examined the process and made reports . Mr. Peabody himself wrote a piece , which was duly published , explaining the system : with the result that everyone agreed that he himself did not understand his own technique . As for the experts , they exhausted all the stock phrases about " orientation , integration , motivation , " etc. , and then it became apparent that they were like the three blind men describing the elephant ? there was no agreement on anything . They differed not only in their conclusions but in the factual reports of what they found going on . Education is one of those subjects , like divorce or constitutional law , on which everyone has an opinion . Some think it is involved with vocational instruction ; some think it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the acquirement of media of self-expression ; and some think it is just a formal process to which the young should be exposed for a certain length of time . The Rector never sold out to any one school of thought in this connection . Sometimes he was sure education ought to be connected with discipline ; sometimes he thought well of science , but more often not ; and as the world changed he changed too . This capacity to change was referred to by his admirers as " growing . " His detractors noted the changes but considered them the irrational results of outside stimuli , the unconscious response of intellectual inertia to current pressures . The conclusions of any particular person in this respect are observed to be heavily influenced by his own investment of time and effort in any particular department of education . When one has labored long years at Latin and Greek one is scornful of the educational value of engineering . And anyone who has put years of work on the study of chemistry is apt to prescribe that subject positively as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rather comic noise in the ears of " educated persons . " When the Rector supported the thesis of the advocates of science they considered him intelligent ; when he opposed the emphasis on science the scientists thought him a mossback . As an actual fact , he was not profound ; but he was alert and intelligent and completely devoid of any shame about changing his mind when he thought he was wrong . This was disconcerting . Indeed , it is hardly fair . He never spent  | any time or effort proving he was right yesterday ; he simply went on to the next thing . He never tried to get even with anybody or bore any grudge . Thus he saved so much time that life appeared leisurely . II THE Rector had a great talent for firing incompetents . He did not fire boys often ; he worked over them . But he was entirely aware of the strong and weak points of the masters ; and those who did not measure up to the requirements he eliminated . This kept the School from becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He hired the masters . He sat in their classes . He listened to their suggestions . When they returned from a trip to Boston he sat up and crossexamined them . He may have had great faith in human nature , but it was a kind of general , impersonal faith . He knew what he was working for , and there was nothing vague or half-hearted in his contact and control . He was just but not particularly sympathetic . It was sometimes felt that a clergyman should have cultivated a more trustful nature which could be imposed on . Well ? he did n't . He was not trustful , but he was completely reliable . When he was on duty he was always the same ? always . He always first appeared before the School at Chapel in the morning , when he wore the usual priest 's robes . After Chapel the boys went at once to the schoolroom at the School House ? all the boys . Every desk was occupied . A master stood at the desk and surveyed the assemblage . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rector would come in . He never hurried . He never sauntered . He always looked the School right in the eye as though he were looking for trouble . The quick cadence of his step was always exactly the same . His black shoes were polished . His blue suit , starched collar , white bow-tie , also starched , were always exactly and precisely as expected . He mounted the steps to the dais . He took the framed schedule of events from the master . He turned slightly to the right . " First Form ? History . . . . Second Form ? Latin . . . . " Under his eye the School filed out to the first recitation of the day . Four hours later he dismissed the School from the same platform . He did it ? no one else . He read the detention , sent out the mail , and made what announcements were in order . At dinner the School stood at their places while he asked a blessing . The blessing never varied . It was short and impersonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter what he had been doing during the afternoon , at supper he was back in the blue suit , white starched tie , and black shoes . He asked the blessing . The boys went from the dining room to the schoolroom , and he conducted evening prayers . He stood at the desk and read from the New Testament ? always . Then he knelt down on the floor and read some familiar prayers . When prayers were concluded he went out in the hall ; and Brooks House filed by and said " Goodnight , sir " ; and to each he said , " Goodnight , my boy , " and shook his hand . That was the system . So far as a casual observer could see , that was all there was to it . The experts came and talked about Freud and Jung and looked for hidden significances , and neurotic parents moaned and chattered ; but nothing was ever done to change it . Long , long afterward , boys could recall the tones of his voice as he read the prayers : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . until we come to thine everlasting kingdom . " He taught the First Form Latin . The boys learned no Latin to speak of and picked up no interesting information on the side . He was not unkind , but the children were ill at ease . The class never seemed to get going . There were no interludes , no nonsense ? not even explosions . Whenever the Latin suspended for an instant there was a kind of Peter Parley talk which bored the boys . The contrast between this and the Greek classes conducted by Amory Gardner was stupefying . Mr. Gardner did not actually juggle balls and Indian clubs , but  | only because it did not occur to him or any of the boys . He did not actually cut himself with clamshells , because he had no clams handy ; but he would leap up in the air , and beat his breast , and tear his hair , and faint with fervor . And , withal , a lot of boys learned a lot of Greek ; while the gossip they picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max Muller , Grimm 's Law , and the private lives of the denizens of Mt . Olympus was wholly incredible . Amory Gardner was always wanting to address the School , and the Rector was forever thwarting this ambition . The Rector was right . Besides this Latin class , Mr. Peabody undertook the instruction of the Fifth and Sixth Form in Sacred Studies . The origin of the ensuing difficulties is obscure . From time to time some tough-minded intellectuals turned up among the boys ; but the Rector knew what he was talking about ? in the beginning at any rate ? and no confusion ought to have occurred . But confusion there was . Somehow the subject would get turned round ; and it seemed as if the class were enamored of Mohammed and on the verge of embracing Islam . And this of course was quite all right if only these exuberant explorers were open-minded enough to see , before the end of the hour , that Christianity was best after all . But sometimes it was just touch and go whether they could be brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clock struck . It was nervous work . Buddha was disposed of without difficulty . Apparently Nirvana excited no interest , and Gautama no converts . But when Zoroaster came along there were ten short minutes spent on him ; and for the other fifty minutes the faithful St. Bernard dogs were searching the Alps for the yodeling Parsees straying far from the company compound . Often it seemed as though there were something almost diabolical in the way the wrong side was put on the defense . The spectacle made some boys nervous , and the stupider a boy was the more embarrassed he became . But there were volatile devils who enjoyed it and the range of whose speculations never failed to exceed all reasonable bounds . III CHAPEL came every morning in the form of morning prayers , a hymn , and a psalm . One became familiar with a lot of psalms , and with Cranmer 's Prayer Book . On Sunday there were services morning and evening . In the evening the hot tears coursed down the cheeks of the little new boys during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through it themselves . At the morning service the Rector would alternate with Mr. Billings in preaching the sermon . Both of them preached without dramatics in the strict New England tradition . The importance of sermons is underestimated . At an evening service in the Town Hall at Groton , in May one year , Dr. Rainsford made some remarks about the Origin of Species which resulted in at least thirty boys reading that book ; and it was a topic of discussion for weeks . The sermons of Mr. Billings were excellent . The Rector 's sermons were stuffy . For some reason the boys did not seem to believe them . Certain phrases recurred continually : " The dyer 's hand is subdued to what it is dipped in . . . . Sanctify yourselves for their sakes . " . . . The boys wanted to live dangerously and see life . The Rector wanted them to be pure in heart and to keep unspotted from the world . These objectives are not inconsistent ; but you can not capture the imagination of boys by talking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beggars wanted was to excite the admiration and astonishment of the other monkeys : in short , just what everyone wants to-day , and always has wanted since Cheops built the pyramid . After St. George killed the dragon he was very popular ; and it is obviously up to the proprietor of a large stable of boys to provide dragons right along . Now there was something phony about Mr. Peabody 's dragons . Instead of getting into some old clothes , and sneaking up on the dragon , and grabbing him by the neck , and sinking your teeth in his jugular vein , while he roared and writhed and breathed out clouds of smoke ? but you hung on : it was n't like that . . . . In the first place , you had to go in training ; and then when  | the dragon was brought round it appeared you were to talk him to death , or set him a good example , or something : more like St. Georgianna than St. George . It was a continuous puzzlement what kind of a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incompatible with the way he talked ; and the boys believed their eyes rather than their ears . He was humble with the cortex maximums ? by an effort of will ? and he was " liberal " the same way . He was determined to be liberal ? if it killed him . And so of course he was not really liberal ; he was only determined , like the man who is honest because honesty is the best policy : such a man is not honest ; he is politic . It was his true essence which he communicated to the boys . They learned determination , to know cricket from noncricket , to be unafraid ; and these attributes carried some to honor and glory , and some to infamy and disgrace . Lord Rosebery is reported to have said as a young man that he had three ambitions : to marry an heiress , to own a Derby winner , and to be Prime Minister . He achieved all three , but he was not generally admired . It was felt that he paid too high a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boys scorn precepts , but they will imitate heroes . The selection of heroes to introduce to the attention of boys is an important matter . Socrates , Jesus , Servetus , Bruno , Galileo , Cromwell , John Hampden , George Washington were all lawbreakers . Most of them were tried and executed according to the law of their time . Prohibition came along . It proved completely unenforceable . Practically all the graduates of the School became criminals . Admittedly the noble experiment operated to breed corruption , to teach girls to drink gin , to flout the law , to create disorder , and to produce a host of ills . When one consulted solemnly with oneself it was evident that , measured by any frame of reference that made sense , the situation demanded resistance as clearly as the imposition of Ship Money Taxes by Charles I. To comply was to co-operate with tyranny . The graduates , from the first , saw this clearly and saw it whole , and contributed steadily to the breakdown of enforcement . The Rector went through a slow mutation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who persuaded him that to be a criminal was the worst thing that could happen to his boys ; and so he started out to urge compliance . Then someone called him the Vicar of Bray and said he had sold out his real convictions for a mess of pottage called " law and order . " All the criminal graduates came up to the School , and for the first time in their lives felt morally superior . The biographies of the great , mentioned above , were pointed out to him . The worst of it was everyone was kind and solicitous about it ; and the amount of interest taken in the New Testament was prodigious . Even the stockbrokers were reading it . This was a wonderful and chastening experience . For once a moral question got so complicated that it was not instantly apparent what the proper course was . And though many a graduate had an attack of the dry grins on observing the Rector 's predicament , not one had any thought that he was cowardly or taking the easy path . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out all by himself : and they knew he never did really think any less of them even if they were criminals . IV THE Rector complained a good deal about the vacations especially the short vacations at Christmas and Easter . He said the younger boys came back infected with various contagious maladies , and the older boys lost from five to fifteen pounds in weight , and were returned exceedingly demoralized . Said they spent their time at the theater , and later discussed , not the merits of character portrayal , nor the problems presented , but " the beauty of actresses . " He just had not thought this out . Any boy of seventeen who was more interested in the technique of drama than in feminine pulchritude would have been an object of suspicion to the Rector at the very first contact . But he was right in complaining  | about the vacations . They were too violent . The boys reacted from the ascetic , cloistered existence at Groton like sailors getting shore liberty ; and though the damage was not permanent it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult . If they were rich they took their boys to Jekyll Island , and thus supplied a sterilized playground from which there was no escape . But if they had to live in New York or Boston the boys ran themselves ragged . The Rector exercised a kind of remote control which operated to involve the parents in collusive and clandestine breaches of unenforceable edicts . The problem continued to be a worry for many years ; but the attempted control became less , and more responsibility was left to the parents . No satisfactory solution was ever evolved . The young continue to be interested in actresses . V THEN one reads Tom Brown 's School Days one does not get the impression that Dr. Arnold had any noticeable sense of humor . Perhaps the best people did not have one in those days . Punch was started in 1841 ; and a good deal of Aristophanes is more modern than those early copies . What went on around the Rector was not funny . Life was real and life was earnest . It was often gay and cheerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some wonderful things happened . First Amory Gardner built the Chapel . Then he built the Pleasure Dome . A visiting fireman , observing Mr. Gardner in a bath wrapper drinking whiskey after a game of squash , approached him curiously . Thereupon Gardner rose and dropped him an elaborate curtsy . The visitor ( whose collar butoned in the back ) concluded he was in the presence of extreme depravity ? in which delusion he was of course encouraged by a couple of irresponsible graduates ? and vas going to tell the Rector about it . He lad to be personally escorted to Ayer , and went home to grow up . The Rector 's conception of what was funny was Burnand 's Happy Thoughts . ' his book was published in 1871 , having previously come out piecemeal in Punch . It is funny too ? if you have plenty of time . He used to read it aloud when he and Mrs. Peabody went on picnics with the Fifth Form in the springtime . He was born in 1857 ; and the decade from 1870 to 1880 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If anyone will look through the bound volumes of Punch for those ten years a great light will break on him . For there are all the jokes , the preoccupation with playing fields , the impatience with vulgarity , the social dilemmas of the well-endowed dowagers , the total ignorance of life on any other plane , the complete confidence in the morality of property , the feminine women , the protective and possessive men , the swells and the bounders and the snobs ? in short , there is portrayed the benign complacency of a ruling class which had no regrets for the past and no fears for the future . The remarkable thing is not that , brought up in this society , the Rector was inscrutable and different from homegrown grass-root Americans , but that when he finally came back to Boston he was endurable at all . He was not only endurable ; he was very popular . He was also indestructible . He counted himself a clergyman . He had loyal labor-union ties with clergymen . He was always helping worthless ones . But many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. Atwood , Bishop of Arizona , a lifelong intimate of the Rector 's ( he used to preach sermons at School ; he was bald as a billiard ball , and was known by the boys as " the Mexican Hairless " ) not only insisted that Mr. Peabody was a great executive , but said he would have made a wonderful banker : , that the way he got money for the School was little short of miraculous . Others said he was a great leader , a teacher , a noble character , a guide , philosopher , and friend . They agreed only on one point : he did not remotely resemble a clergyman . He was something like Coke of Norfolk . VI SOPHISTICATED persons know that it is not enough to be right . In this world it is necessary to be successful also . This  | is often resented by closet theorists ? especially women ? but wise men accept the universe and get on with their knitting . Of all this the Rector was fully aware . He never formulated it because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find expression in words . But the boys were indoctrinated with this philosophy ; and when they grew up they wasted no time feeling sorry for themselves or weeping over past mistakes . This attitude is conducive to an urgency which tended to push boys a little farther along the road to success than they would have got under their own steam . Unfortunately it did not induce any increased discrimination in the selection of occupations , and the graduates took to finance as eagerly as to medicine . The Rector saw this very clearly ; but his only weapon of opposition was exhortation . He urged the boys to go into the professions and keep away from Wall Street . He lectured on vocations in Sacred Studies : and they asked him how an Army officer could possibly send his son to Groton . He had not thought of it . His whole School project required a large income for its customers . When he urged the boys to be true to themselves and drop out of their parents ' income class , they simply did not hear him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send their sons to Groton . That was the first and great commandment . This business of money and vocations was fantastic , and the Rector got no help on it . Everybody from Jacob Riis to Booker Washington undertook to give talks to the boys and advise them . In the very early years of the century Gifford Pinchot , who was then a forester , came up to lecture on forestry . The lecture is long forgotten ; but , at its close , he looked at the boys meaningly , almost menacingly , and said : " Fortunate is the man so rich he does not have to work ; but twice fortunate is the rich man who works hard though he does not have to . " He might have saved his breath . When the annual product grew up , rich and poor alike fell to the task of making money and getting power with a fury which astounded their classmates in college . T. R. came up when he was President , and he too made a few remarks . He urged the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trips in the Adirondacks ? honestly , that is what he said . It sounded awfully pukka at the time ; but long afterward many wondered what it was all about . While the exhortations were complete duds , the civilizing influences organized by the Rector were at work all the time . If a boy was oversensitive or spastic or hysterical the School was , certainly during some periods , a cruel place ; for neither wealth nor prominence availed to buy peace . But for the average youngster there were interludes which almost seemed a link with the great world . There was " parlor night " twice a week in Mrs. Peabody 's house , which was always polite and often amusing ; and Mrs. Peabody always remembered a boy 's first name ? which restored morale , somehow . Another morale-tonic was the requirement that shirts be changed for supper and also shoes . And there were " sing-songs " in the wintertime and debates and the choir and the play in short , various arenas where excellence did not depend on physique or seniority ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cat lying in the sunshine bother its head about astrophysics ? And why should one try to analyze a benign influence , and label it " Victorian , " or " Neo-Anglican , " or " Muscular Christianity " ? To classify the Rector does not contribute to any better understanding of him . All one can do is to tell what was visible , and let each appraiser put it together as he sees it . That he was inarticulate was evident . That he probably was quite as sensitive as anybody normally is , was not so evident . He was exceedingly polite , but there is nc doubt he got very angry on occasion . Ir being polite he was not just suave ? he wa : friendly and frank and controlled . He forgave a lot of mean things tha were done to him ? even some outrageous ones ? and thereby disarmed his enemies And this was not merely a pose . He really did forgive them . This was one o the secrets of his indestructibility.  | Ile had little conception of the strains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he used to infuriate fathers of sinful sons by summoning them to come to School and confer about their brats . At the conference it usually appeared that the son was white as snow compared with the father at the same age . This unawareness of the world 's standards was the principal ? perhaps only ? clergyman-attribute which he had . He said , himself , that his greatest regret was his failure to inculcate a livelier moral sense in boys ; but he was up against the whole world . After all , morals are customs ; but he thought they were absolutes . If he had been attacked by a thug he would have observed the Marquis of Queensberry rules . His real occupation at the School was the enforcement of civilization . The boys got up early and went to bed tired . There was a first-class library , and there were educated men on the faculty . These were the ingredients ; and he kept them in balance . He was just , according to his lights , and he was consistent ; and he dealt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole , he was rather more reliable on punishments than on rewards . He never disappointed the School by overlooking infractions of decorum or virtue . He made it quite plain to boys that each must live his own life ? that no one else could do this for him ? and he was unsympathetic when any of them felt sorry for themselves . He was the pater families , and the boys instinctively trusted him even when they criticized him . And he just walked back and forth in the cool of the day .  |
