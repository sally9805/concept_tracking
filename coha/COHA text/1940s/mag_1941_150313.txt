The U.S. Army has grown 548% since 1936 , but one branch of it , the Engineers-which last week stood a review on the shadeless , red-dusty parade ground of Fort Belvoir , Va. , 15 miles south of Washington on the bank of the Potomac-has grown 1,160% . <P> Best-educated and most versatile branch of the Army is the Corps of Engineers . Officered by scholastic top-rankers from West Point and by graduates of such crack schools as M.I.T. , Purdue and Caltech , the Engineers like to brag that they can do anything . In peacetime they build dams and - levees for power and flood control , think nothing of odd jobs like filling top-flight posts in WPA , the Civil Aeronautics Administration . In wartime they do a thousand jobs behind the lines , pave the way for infantry and tanks up front , often use shooting irons as well as shovels . Rednecked fighting men as well as skilled technicians , the Engineers are highly respected by other men in uniform . <P> The 8,000 men who last week strode smartly past Belvoir 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were more Engineers than anyone had seen together since World War I. Only two weeks before , Belvoir 's garrison had been 3,000 . Within a month it will be 10,000 , and more will shortly be training at the Corps 's second replacement training center at Fort Leonard Wood , near Rolla , Mo . By July 1 , when the Army has hit a strength of 1,418,000 , there will be 91,000 Engineers . <P> Marching in Belvoir 's review was many an oldtimer . They were the ones who knew , and who dinned that knowledge into the recruits , that Surveyor George Washington was father of the Corps of Engineers , that Sylvanus Thayer and Lee and Goethals and MacArthur were members of the Corps . A few could recall the day in November 1918 when the famed Second Division lined up with its Engineer regiment in the honor position on the right of the line . The division cheered mightily when the ribbon of the Croix de Guerre was pinned on the Engineers ' colors . That honor was for a day at Soissons when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,700 prisoners . <P> At Belvoir , as at other training stations , Engineer recruits get their primary soldiering in big doses , soon pass on to specialized training . Some will join combat regiments and battalions , will go into battle with infantry and artillery , lugging in motor trains a fantastic assortment of bulldozers , water-purification outfits , pneumatic drills , earth-borers . Some will join ponton ( Engineer for pontoon ) companies , will learn to sweat hip-deep in rivers , laying bridges for the infantry . Others will go to topographical ( mapmaking ) outfits , to railroad-operating companies , to general service regiments , to camouflage battalions , dump-truck companies , water-supply battalions , shop companies , depot companies .
