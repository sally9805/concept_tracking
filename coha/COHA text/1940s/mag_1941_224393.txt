It was Thomas Gainsborough 's portrait of the 4th Duke of Rutland , long known in art circles ( by an analogy with Gainsborough 's much more celebrated Blue Boy as the Black Boy . Along with two other valuable paintings-Gainsborough 's landscape , The Wayfarer , and a portrait of Charles the Bold by an unknown Flemish artist-the Black Boy came to an unworthy end . <P> Vienna-born Marie Hauser , 45 , was deeply attached to the wife and family of her employer , Captain Daniel Sickles , art-collecting official of Langley Aviation Corporation of Port Washington .

The Black Boy was insured for $25,000 , the other two for $19,000 . Last week , recovering from a suicide attempt in Manhattan 's Bellevue Hospital prison ward , Marie babbled incoherently that she thought the Captain had been keeping bad company in his wife 's absence . Murmured she : " I wanted to hurt him . "
