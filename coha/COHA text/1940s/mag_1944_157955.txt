The U.S. was in the grip of a war-production slump last week that had the War Department thoroughly alarmed . <P> Once again the brass hats considered ask ing Congress for a National Service Act to compel men to work in vital industries . <P> Lieut . General Brehon Somervell , chief of the Army Service Forces , said he was getting urgent requests from Generals Eisenhower , Clark and MacArthur for more &; more weapons and equipment . He said he could not begin to fill some of the orders . Reason : the manpower trouble had brought acute shortages in eleven vital production fields-foundries and forges , artillery , heavy ammunition , electronics , heavy tires , steel plates , tanks , tank destroyers , dry cell batteries , cotton textiles , TNT and other explosives . <P> The Army , always nervous over the re conversion of war plants to civilian goods , and often accused of crying wolf about manpower , this time had some sound argument ments against " premature " reconversion . <P> There was less manpower in U.S. found ries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manpower was already below minimum needs . <P> There was not a single bomber tire in the Army 's inventory . <P> There was a need for 300% more heavy shells than anticipated-due to the in creasing use of massed firepower . <P> General MacArthur needed tents badly , because the Pacific advance was so fast that wooden barracks were left behind . <P> General Eisenhower needed big quantities of hospital tents , because the German scorched-earth policy was effectively wiping out billeting facilities . <P> There was no easy solution to this slump . The major shortages were in the backbreaking , body-toasting , low-wage industries , where production usually falls off in hot weather . This summer it has dropped even more sharply , as good war news has sent workers scurrying into more attractive , more secure civilian jobs . <P> Confronted with this evidence , even reconversion-minded WPBoss Donald Nelson got worried . Promptly he set aside his squabble with the War Department over the slow return to civilian production ( TIME , July 24 ) and joined hands with the Services and the War Manpower Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With his frequent opponent , General Somervell , Nel son planned to go on the air early this week to appeal to the people . So did War Secretary Stimson , just back from Normandy . <P> With no law to back it up , the War Department can only make it plain that workers ' failure to sweat it out in the toughest , most thankless war-production jobs may ultimately be measured in lost American lives .
