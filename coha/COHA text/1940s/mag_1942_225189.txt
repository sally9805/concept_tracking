No eyebrows were raised , either in surprise or indignation , when the tired , lightweight 1935-elected House of Commons almost unanimously voted to postpone Britain 's general election for another year. * No one except bumptious Independent Bill Brown compared Parliament to the Reichstag , or intimated that this might be a signpost on the road to British fascism . <P> The British people recognized the legitimate obstacles in the way of radically altering the democratic body elected to represent them , which many felt represented them no longer . For a general election , there was no complete register of voters : voters had been called up , industrially shifted and concentrated , evacuated , blitzed out of old addresses . Most new voters had never been registered at all . An election would divert precious energy from the war effort , create bitterness which might destroy national unity . It would not solve Britain 's standing political dilemma , succinctly expressed by the sober weekly Economist : <P> " There are two statements about the present condition of British politics which would be almost universally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two large parties evokes the slightest enthusiasm in the ranks of the people . The other is that these two parties are so firmly in command of the machinery of politics that there is no prospect for a long time of dislodging either or both of them . " <P> *Parliament had ample precedent . In Britain the frequency of elections is set not by the Constitution but by law . This was the third one-year extension vote since World War II began . In the World War I period , the House of Commons had repealed the statute giving it a five-year maximum life , had voted itself in continuous office from 1910 to 1918 . An Act of Commons extending its own duration is the only one still subject to absolute veto in the Lords .
