Texans bragged this week about a triumph of commerce-with a touch of culture . Dallas ' Cokesbury Book Store staked out a claim as the biggest in the U.S. It made no difference to Cokesbury that Manhattan 's Brentano 's and Macy 's disputed the claim . With hymn and prayer befitting its ownership by the Methodist Church , * and with typical Texasity , the block-long , five-story Cokesbury opened a three-story addition and plugged away at surpassing its sales of $1,635,000 , profits of $140,000 during its last fiscal year . <P> Within its chaste white marble walls , Cokesbury carries 300 different kinds of Bibles plus multidenominational religious supplies ranging from Sunday-school buttons to Torahs for synagogues . But this is a sideline to a fervently commercial trade that sells 70,000 secular titles to some of the country 's most avid book buyers . Dallas spends about $6 per capita on books annually ( the U.S. average : $2 ) . <P> General Manager James Floyd Albright , a onetime soda clerk who began at Cokesbury as a shipping clerk in 1925 , has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " It 's aggressive salesmanship . That and a large stock . We want to have books people want when they come in here . " <P> Albright bombards 54,000 customers all over the Southwest with as many as 250 leaflets a year , plus an annual 100-page catalogue and two supplements . He has taken a firm hold on the business of supplying Texas schools and institutions . He also buys up publishers ' remainders at rock-bottom prices , dolls them up in new dustjackets , sometimes changes the titles a bit , and keeps them moving across the counters and through the mails . <P> Says Albright : " We do n't hit for the literary type of the booklover in spite of all our walnut paneling . There are so few of them we 'd starve to death in no time . " Albright , known in the trade as the " corn salesman , " once heard a bookseller complain to a publisher that nothing was being published for the thinking man . Said Albright : " I told them that the average man . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed was more corn . " <P> <P> * Which owns 13 other bookstores around the U.S. , and printing plants in Nashville , Chicago and Cincinnati .
