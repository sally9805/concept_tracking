Up to now , doctors have not been able to tell , except by waiting for years , whether treatments for cancer were successful . But young ( 34 ) Dr. Philip M. West , senior research associate at the medical school of the University of California at Los Angeles , thinks he has found a way to show quickly whether the patient or the cancer is getting the upper hand . <P> Working with Technician Jessamine Hilliard , West noted that the milk-curdling property of blood varies with the patient 's health . He attributed this to the relative strength of two enzyme inhibitors . These two inhibitors are mysterious , complex substances , not yet isolated and still nameless . They serve as policemen , regulating the action of the two enzymes : rennin ( found mainly in the stomach ) and chymotrypsin ( in the pancreas ) . Both the enzymes are ferments which curdle milk . Their inhibitors circulate in the bloodstream . <P> By adding solutions of the enzymes to homogenized milk , West fixed the normal curdling time . Then he repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted the longer curdling times . His figures gave an index to the normal strength of the inhibitors . <P> In the presence of cancers , West found , the chymotrypsin inhibitor is greatly multiplied . As soon as a cancer patient responds favorably to treatment , the normal proportion ( with the rennin inhibitor more abundant ) is restored . Sometimes , West reported this week in the Annals of Western Medicine and Surgery , his test will give the first indication that a patient needs fresh treatment ( for example , X rays ) if recovery is to continue . <P> U.C.L.A. rashly called the West test " the first rapid and accurate method " of determining whether cancer treatment is having any effect .
