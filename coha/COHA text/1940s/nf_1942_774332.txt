txt  | will be the case , not merely if their public service plants are yet to be constructed , but also if they have already been constructed and are incompletely utilized , provided only that they were constructed , because of rising prices , at higher cost than the utilities in the older communities . In other words , this policy tends to divert industry uneconomically and undesirably from one locality to another with resulting economic loss to the public as a whole . It may be objected that if a railroad or other public service utility plant is already constructed and is not very completely utilized , any traffic or business which covers the bare additional cost of moving the goods or rendering the service is worth taking . Here , however , we must look at the problem from a practical , long-run viewpoint . The policy of forcing rates down to mere costs of operating , if generally adopted in such cases without a government subsidy , would tend to compel higher rates in cases of full utilization , to make the risks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a chance of special gain to offset the risk of unprofitable construction , and would so tend to retard , somewhat , economic development . If rates were kept down with the aid of a government subsidy , the door would be open to favoritism and abuse . But , in any case , no such policy is practically desirable in the long run . Whatever may be said for making rates low to encourage utilization of a plant already built , growth of population and business may finally raise the question of construction of new or additional facilities . Yet this construction should not follow , so diverting capital from other lines , unless the needs of the community are such that a reasonable return can be paid on current cost . How test , in the long run , the desirability of such construction , other than by charging rates high enough to yield a return thereon and so judging whether there would be enough business at those rates to justify the construction ? If it be argued  | that a plant once built should be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs , it can be argued with no less cogency that the plant should not be built ? or have been built ? unless the rates it can charge are likely to make the building worth while . As a long-run public policy , therefore , it would appear that a return ought to be allowed , if it can be secured . This does not mean that special business ( e.g. , night messages or certain classes of traffic ) may not properly be taken at rates little more than enough to cover bare additional cost . Such a policy we have seen to be desirable . It does mean that undesirable turning of industry from one locality to another , or other economic waste , is likely to be caused by a policy which does not allow ? if the customers can be made to pay it  - -  a fair return on current cost of construction . The sane , long-run policy is one which puts the burden of paying for the service , on those who receive it . The argument for stressing current cost of plant construction rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers if we turn our attention to the possibility of a fall in cost of construction . If contemporary construction costs are lower than past costs , then to insist on allowing rates based on historical cost is to permit higher rates than are necessary to pay fair returns on contemporary cost . Such a policy tends to discourage railroad transportation , or use of electric power or other service , which is worth paying for to the extent of a reasonable return on the full contemporary cost . In the case of transportation , such rates act like protective tariff duties in preventing a worth-while specialization of different communities and trade between them . Can we consistently object to tariff duties as restrictions on trade and as tending to keep the communities concerned poor , while at the same time we favor a system of valuation of railroads for  | rate-making purposes , which would be likely to accomplish in some degree the same kind of result ? Again , a policy of basing rates on historical cost , when contemporary cost is lower , penalizes the older communities which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new community which can construct plants at low cost can have low rates ; but the old community must pay higher rates , just because it has plants already constructed , than if it could start over . So industry must tend to go to the newer places even if they are in other respects less well adapted to production purposes . The tendency would be to wither and dry up the longer-established towns and cities . In a competitive industry a new and cheaper mechanism for producing a given article or service is likely not to have anything like its full effect on price until it has been widely adopted . So , in regulating a public service industry , we may properly regard cost of duplication as prima facie evidence of what it would now cost to construct a plant capable of rendering the desired service . But if a new mechanism for rendering the service comes finally to be recognized generally among engineers as cheaper and , perhaps , is widely adopted , then the old mechanism may be fairly regarded as having become obsolete . Under such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates on the old basis , in order to protect against loss those public utility companies that have too long delayed installing the new and cheaper mechanism , is to impose on the public the expense of the outworn method . So to regulate rates is really to submit the public in general to the rule of the " dead hand . " In competitive industries those who manage most efficiently make the largest returns and those who are last to adopt new and effective means of production make the smallest returns or ,  | frequently , no returns at all . Is it not fair both to the public and to the public service industries , and most conducive to progress , to apply , as far as possible , the same principle in the regulation of public utility rates ? In relation to the public service industries as also in other connections has arisen the question as to who should enjoy the increment in land values . Despite a few minor qualifications it is pretty generally recognized by economists that the value of land is in a very special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the value of even a large piece of land is very little . Land values grow as society grows and develops . An acre of land in a great city may be worth several million dollars , not because of anything the owner has done but solely because of the growth of population immediately about it and in the tributary village and farm communities , and because of the building of roads and railroads . A piece of land on the bank of a river may be of comparatively little value until the growth of nearby industrial centers which can use to advantage the power capable of being there generated makes this land and the privilege of harnessing the stream , of tremendous value . In case such a source of power is sufficient to meet the entire demand in the neighboring industrial centers , rate regulation , if applied , might prevent the enjoyment of any unearned increment by an electric power company . But if this power is not sufficient and some of the industries must be supplied with steam-generated power at higher cost , discrimination between industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water-power-generated electricity be equally high . Then , certainly , the company owning the water-power site and the permit or franchise to harness the stream , possesses a privilege to which high value has been given by population growth and industrial  | development , and from which it can draw a tremendous socially-produced income . So it has been urged , and not without reason , that the states and the Federal government would do well not to grant away forever to private corporations the right to make use of these privileges ( so far as they are still under public control ) but to lease them only , ? and for limited terms . In no case should a private individual ( or company ) have any legal right to prevent others from harnessing a stream which he himself does not intend to use . With the development of the radio a somewhat similar situation has been arising in regard to radio wave lengths . The available wave lengths ( far enough apart to avoid interference ) appear not to be nearly numerous enough to provide for all who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scarcity value . To be permitted the exclusive use of a wave length for broadcasting to millions of listeners is to have a special and , perhaps , valuable privilege which all can not have . Such a privilege ought not to be the source of great private income , through charges to advertisers or otherwise , in excess of a reasonable return on the duplication cost of the necessary broadcasting mechanism . This can be avoided if the holders of the broadcasting privilege are obliged to pay for it , to the public , whatever the privilege is fairly worth . We need not conclude that the payment must be in the form of a money rent or tax collected by government , although this would seem , a priori , to be the ideal arrangement . The desired result may possibly be accomplished by requiring payment to the public at large through the provision of sufficiently expensive and good programs . Perhaps nothing is more important than that broadcasting stations be open , without discrimination , to divergent opinions . But , certainly , no policy is justifiable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sunshine , water power , coal mines , and sites in a big city ? are not individually produced , that the value , if any , of these wave lengths is an outgrowth of social and technological development , and that they must not be  | treated as in any sense the exclusive property of individuals . If , with insistence upon high quality of service or unremunerative educational or other programs , there is nevertheless substantial privileged income to holders of the broadcasting permits , this excess income ought certainly to he demanded by government as a rent or license fee or tax . Experience must determine what are the requirements of wise public policy . In the case of the railroads ' rights of way and terminals , private ownership of the land has been long since realized . he question of unearned increment for them has been nterpreted to mean the question whether the full present market value of their land should be counted as part of the total valuation on which they may be permitted to earn a reasonable return . The argument here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to fix rates on the basis of original cost of land and construction would free the public from the necessity of paying a return on the unearned increment of land values . There is certainly a great deal to be said in favor of the principle that the socially-produced rental value of land ought to be mainly , if not entirely , enjoyed by society as a whole . This class of incomes , due almost solely to social development and not to individual activity , can be taken y society without decreasing such individual activity . In a later chapter the relevant arguments will be set forth at length . But the wise method of attaining this result s through a consistent , if nevertheless gradual , change in ur system of taxation . To attempt to obtain the rent of land for society by rate regulation works in the direction of diverting industry from its normal lines somewhat as a tariff or a bounty might divert it . To tell people that they may not , in any circumstances , enjoy an unearned increment in land values but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economic rent of their nd , shall be taken from them by taxation , will not them to refrain from production . Nor will such a policy  | cause any of them to change from a line in which they are more efficient to one in which they are less efficient and can earn less . But to tell them that they may have an unearned increment if they use their land for any extractive , manufacturing or mercantile purpose , yet may not have such an increment if they use the land for a railroad right of way and terminals , is , if the former uses look at all promising , to encourage these former uses and discourage the latter use . But let us look at this same matter from a very slightly different point of view . If the unearned increment can be enjoyed on land used in other ways but not on railroad land , then , it may be , the price which prospective builders of railroads are able to offer for land will tend to be less relatively to the price which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other ways . This condition will operate to discourage railroad building . People will not be anxious to sell their land for a lower price to a railroad company than they can get from individuals or corporations planning to use the land otherwise , nor will they usually be compelled to sell their land thus low when condemnation proceedings are started under the law of eminent domain . Some of those who favor holding rates on railroads to an original-cost basis without regard to changes in the value of land , really recognize this difficulty . They plan to allow  | a somewhat higher rate of return to offset the loss of the chance at an unearned increment . At the same time they plan to protect the railroads , in some degree , against a possible decrease in the value of their land . For they would reckon the value of the entire plant at the historicalcost figure , for rate-making purposes , regardless of increases or decreases in the value of land as well as regardless of increases or decreases in the prices of construction goods . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would compel a declining community with falling land values to pay rates based on its former high land values just when it could least afford to do so . It might have to pay higher rates , just because its railroad had been long-since constructed , than if it had been recently constructed . Costs of construction of public utility plants may change independently of changes in the general level of prices . Yet the larger changes in construction costs go along with and are part of changes in the price level . So far as this is the case the problem of public utility valuation for the purpose of rate regulation becomes a part of the general problem of price level fluctuations and of the difficulties caused by them . In this connection it ought to be clear that those who think public utility rates must not be raised proportionately when the general price level has risen , because of supposed unfairness to the public , are in an utterly illogical position . When prices in general have doubled , a doubled rate for transportation or light or power is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To pay twice as many dollars for shipping goods , when twice as many dollars are received by the producers of goods ; to pay twice as much for gas , electric light and commuters ' railroad services when wages and salaries are also twice as high as previously , is  | not really to pay more in any but a nominal sense . It is to pay twice as many dollars when each dollar is worth half as much . And at the same time security holders of the public service industries , though they receive twice as many dollars as before , do not receive any more in real purchasing power . Suppose , on the other hand , that the price level should fall , during a fairly short period , by one-half , and that , concomitantly , cost of construction of railroads and other public utility plants should fall by the same per cent . Then if the railroads and other utilities were allowed rates to make the usual percentage return and to make it on their historical cost of construction , the public which patronized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield the current per cent return on newly-constructed plants . These rates , therefore , would not be lower than the previous rates in the proportion in which prices generally were lower . Persons who had invested in other industries would find their returns cut in half , although these returns would be as high a percentage of the likewisehalved cost of plant reproduction . These lowered returns , however , would buy as much at the reduced price level as the higher returns had previously bought , so that there would be , for the investors in these industries , as a class , no real loss . But it is proposed that the investors in publicservice industries shall occupy a protected position . When all other prices fall by one-half , the rates of such industries and , therefore , the rates of railroads , shall be regulated so as to fall by a much less amount and so as to leave for investors in railroads returns as high as before and returns which , at the reduced price level , will purchase twice as much as before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? as some writers and publicists would have it do ? by which it would avoid a proportionate increase in utility rates when prices generally are higher and when an increase of rates is really not an added burden , at the cost of allowing rates not to fall in proportion when prices in general ,  | including construction costs , fall greatly and when rates must be paid in dollars of higher value which it is harder to earn . But such a bargain might turn out , in the end , to be a very bad one . Is it fair to succeeding generations of consumers for this generation to make such a bargain ? Would succeeding generations be morally obligated to adhere to it ? Permanently to stabilize the general price level would go far to relieve us from this as from many other troublesome problems . Instability of the price level may be thought of as an evil that affects nearly all of our economic relations and arrangements . We can best avoid its undesirable consequences by removing their cause . The bondholders of a company are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its earnings prior to the claim of stockholders . Sometimes , too , there are preferred stockholders whose claims precede those of common stockholders . But the common stockholders are entitled to any returns from the business which are left over after the fixed obligations have been met . Unfortunately , most contracts with bondholders and other lenders are made with no allowance for possible changes in the price level . Therefore , rising prices , with the usually accompanying larger returns from business , leave bondholders with no increase in money incomes . The whole increase goes to the stockholders who , therefore , normally secure an increase in their money incomes much more than in proportion to the increase of prices .  | On the other hand , falling prices with correspondingly decreased returns from business , leave bondholders receiving the agreed money incomes , so long as the business can pay these incomes , even though this means larger real incomes and even though there may be nothing at all left for the stockholders . All this is really but an exemplification of the general fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lenders and that in periods of falling prices lenders gain at the expense of borrowers . But it has been made the basis of an argument in favor of the historicalcost basis of valuation . The contention made is that public utility companies are largely financed by bond issues and preferred stock , that these securities , especially the bonds , should be protected against possible default in payment in periods of falling prices , that it is undesirable for common stockholders to be subjected to heavy loss from falling or exceptional gain from rising prices , and that bankruptcies in the public service industries , which may result from making rates fall with average prices and with construction costs , are demoralizing to efficiency . Although it is true that the stockholders are guarantors of the bondholders and may lose heavily if and when rates fall , nevertheless it is not unreasonable to presume that they took the risk of loss along with the chance of exceptional gain . Why should either the bondholders or the stockholders of a railroad ( or other public-service industry ) be even indirectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guaranteed a fixed money income regardless of what happens to the general price level , when investors in competitive industries have to take their chances ? Then how about the financial stability argument ? True , public utility companies are considerably financed by bonds and preferred stock . True , a long period of falling prices with proportionately falling rates , would especially injure common stockholders and might bring bankruptcies . But manufacturing companies , hotels , office buildings , etc. , are also largely financed by bonds . And many home owners  | and farm owners are heavily burdened by mortgages . These , too , suffer from falling prices . If public utility rates are kept up in such a period , the relative decrease of money or credit is likely to bring it about that other prices fall in an even greater degree . Thus , in protecting the public utility stockholders , we make the situation even worse for countless farmers and other debtors than it would otherwise be . If to be financed so largely by bonds or preferred stock is to protect these companies against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these companies are likely , so soon as prices show signs of dropping , to substitute preferred stock and bonds for even more of their common stock ! The remedy needed here is price-level stabilization , a general remedy for a general economic sickness , not protection of the utilities against rate reduction when all other prices are falling and when the lower rates would yield a good rate of return on what it would then cost to construct the necessary plant . And so , not conceding that any one class of industries is entitled to consideration which other industries do not receive , we come back , at the end of our inquiry into public utility rates and valuation , to the conclusion reached towards the end of the chapter on business depression , that permanent stabilization of the price level is among the most important of all economic reforms . For we can not face the problem of rate regulation in a period of rising or one of falling prices , without taking cognizance of the relations between stockholders and bondholders nor without realizing that these relations obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bondholders are to each other but borrowers and lenders , throughout economic life in general . Thus a period of falling prices which advantages the bondholders of a public utility , advantages bondholders and other lenders in all industries , at the expense of stockholders and other borrowers . The losses to public utility stockholders if prices are not stabilized and if public utility rates are based on current construction costs , may fitly be compared with the losses to farmer and other debtors dur- ing the long period of falling prices from 1865 , following the Civil War inflation , to 1896 . During much of that period American political life was kept in more or less of turmoil from the discontent of debtor classes , especially in the West and Middle West . The demand for a more extended issue by the Federal government of paper money ( the greenbacks ) , the growth of the agitation for an extensive coinage of silver , the compromise silver-purchase and silver-coinage legislation , the rise of Populism as an important political influence , and the enthusiasm for William Jennings Bryan as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free and unlimited coinage of silver at a ratio of 16 to 1 , " might be described as mile posts on that long and disheartening road of price decline . The proposed remedy of free coinage of less than 50 cents worth of silver bullion into a dollar would not have brought price-level stabilization but price-level increase , or would have accentuated the increase that began after 1896 . For when the decline of prices ceased , there began an advance which brought evils to different economic classes than those which had suffered most from the decline , but evils none the less . Caught in the swirl of business fluctuations the causes of which he does not understand , sometimes unexpectedly advantaged , but often robbed by a rising cost of living , unmatched by a correspondingly rapid rise of his income , or bankrupted by falling prices because law and custom do not permit a proportionate scaling down of his debts , the average citizen too frequently lends his support to legislation which seeks to correct the unfair disadvantage of the injured class by giving part of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or he allows the propaganda of interested persons , together with his own prejudices , to lure him into the support of legislation which , like a protective tariff or a subsidy , while it confers special privileges upon certain economic groups , definitely injures still further many of those whose distress it is allegedly intended to relieve . That we may reasonably hope for intelligent legislation in a democracy , there is needed ? as , surely , all of  | us realize in the abstract ? both widespread popular understanding of the nature and mode of operation of the price system and a keen sense of fair play . When shall we have these twin indispensable requisites of a wise and just polity ? In this chapter we have been concerned especially with and have discussed at considerable length , problems connected with the public service industries . We saw , first , that these industries differ from most others in that cost per unit of service decreases for a single plant up to and beyond the point at which the entire demand in a given market or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant is an uneconomical method of producing the service and two or more plants can ordinarily provide a potential supply of the service far beyond the public needs , so that , if there is competition between them , they tend to carry this competition so far that they receive unduly low ? if any ? returns . The solution appeared to be in monopoly , ? but not unregulated monopoly . Coming to the problem of discrimination we saw that certain differences in rates for different services are economically justifiable even though the special costs per unit of service may be the same . Thus , a railroad with unused facilities may properly carry coal for lower rates than brick if these low rates will pay only a very little towards returns on investment , and if the traffic can not be had at higher rates . So , too , lower rates for night than for day messages seemed to be economically justifiable . On the other hand , freight rate discriminations between competitive articles or between raw materials and finished products may tend to produce consequences economically undesirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monopoly and is wholly bad . In general , discrimination between places is economically undesirable .  | Rates as a whole should yield , in public service industries , the ordinary return on investment as measured by the gains of competitive business , with due allowance for possible differences in risk . If the services are not worth this much to the public , it is a fair presumption that the necessary capital should be used , rather , in other lines . Yet the rates should not be excessive so as to constitute an undue burden on the public or prevent use of the service in question by persons who are willing to pay a reasonably profitable rate . In the case of railroads , rates between two points should be only what is necessary to yield a fair return , without discrimination against its intermediate points , to the line able to give the cheapest service . It may sometimes be reasonable for a railroad to make relatively lower rates , where it meets water competition , than at intermediate cities not on the water . A less economical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly carry overflow traffic , and without reducing its intermediate rates , in case it can afford the low rates on the competitive traffic which the more direct line may fairly charge . It thus obviates the necessity of new construction over the cheaper route and economizes the community 's savings . To keep the rates up on the cheaper route in order that the less economical road may make a larger return than it otherwise would be able to make , or in order that it may be able to reduce the rates to intermediate points on its line , involves a discrimination against the points which have to pay these higher rates , tends , like a protective tariff , to interfere with worth-while trade and may amount to a subsidy paid by some towns for the development of others . But in case the more direct line can not handle all the traffic which would naturally go over it and , because of physical limitations , such as rivers and mountain ranges , on the width of its right of way , finds new construction impracticable , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of service of a circuitous line which , in that case , should not discriminate against intermediate  | towns on it . The surplus return of the favored road is economic ( land ) rent . If the public , rather than the lucky railroad , is to secure this rent , it may better be taken by taxation than by attempted rate regulation with consequent unfair discrimination . A parallel case is that of an electric power company having a valuable water-power site from which , however , the available power is insufficient for the district , so that some of the industries or consumers have to use electricity generated by steam at higher cost . Discrimination between users is unfair . The surplus gain from the more-cheaply generated power is economic rent ( land rent ) which should be dealt with by taxation rather than by rate reduction . We came , then , to the problem of how should be determined that value upon which a reasonable per cent return is to be allowed . Some urge actual historical money cost , in case the money was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in the purchasing power of the money unit . But careful consideration revealed the likelihood that such adherence to historical cost would bring various undesirable economic consequences . It would , perhaps , sometimes prevent new construction . It would , if historical costs were greater than current costs , prevent transportation or other service well able to pay its contemporary costs ; and it would give some communities an economically undesirable advantage over others , so tending to divert industry from the latter to the former . Arguments emphasizing the unfortunate predicament of common stockholders during falling prices were judged insufficient to offset the considerations in favor of a contemporary cost basis , especially as the losses referred to in regard to stockholders are not confined to the public service industries and , therefore , require a general rather than a specific preventive . The price system , as we have it in our modern society , is not perfect . Although , in our analyses and expositions of it , we are prone to consider only its major tendencies , it works , often , with a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its confines men lie and cheat , and conspire to practice extortion and to defraud . So far as it operates as a servant of society 's welfare it does not do this automatically and without governmental supervision and control . Government coins money and establishes a monetary standard of value . Government lays down certain rules regarding contracts and other economico-legal relationships . Even in the competitive industries it prohibits ( e.g. , through the Federal Trade Commission ) certain competitive practices which seem to threaten to bring monopoly or which , through deception of consumers or otherwise , merely prevent competition from working most effectively to the public good . In the industries which are not , like the public service industries , economically best run as monopolies , the proper function of government would appear to be to keep the market uncontrolled and fair . To accomplish this end , it should prevent , as it does not always , the substantially unified control of any specific mineral or other product , and any monopolistic agreement , conspiracy or combination . It should prevent deceit and other unfair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information ? if not otherwise available ? that competition will be as perfect as wide knowledge of market forces can make it . So controlled and aided , the price system , in its competitive phases , is probably the best currently possible device for meeting the needs of our economic life . What the public wants as individual consumers does , at any rate , get produced , because it is profitable to produce it , unless the specific article ( e.g. , cocaine ) or service is regarded by the group as sufficiently injurious in its consequences to justify prohibition of its production and marketing . If , indeed , more is produced of what the rich desire than to meet the wants of the poor , this is because the former have larger money incomes to buy with . And whether or not purchasing power is unfairly or undesirably distributed , an attempt to change matters through a compulsory change in the kinds of production carried on would be unwise . If any change is desirable it should be made through dealing with  | the sources of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the direction of industry into different lines . Thus , if the ability of wealthy monopolists to buy goods results in too much of society 's labor force being diverted to the production of these goods , the remedy does not lie in prohibiting the production of the specific goods desired by the monopolists ? which might result in other and poorer consumers of these goods being also sacrificed and in the monopolists buying other goods instead ? but in curbing their monopoly power so that they will not , henceforth , have large unearned incomes to spend . Similarly , if a period of rising prices gives borrowers wealth at the expense of lenders , and stockholders at the expense of bondholders , the remedy does not lie in forbidding men to produce what the prosperous borrowers and stockholders want to buy , but in stabilizing the price level so that borrowers and lenders , stockholders and bondholders , will have reasonably fair and equal chances . And so with those other unearned incomes which we shall discuss at length in Part II . But the price system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose of keeping it or making it as fair as possible , nevertheless still contains a large admixture of freedom of choice , ? freedom as to what work to do , freedom as to the acquisition and use of property , freedom as to what to buy . And with this freedom we get a certain rough equilibrium among different producing groups , a certain tendency to balanced returns in different industries , and a meeting of our needs as consumers , all of which it is highly doubtful if we could get so satisfactorily in any other way ? say by compelling labor to be done in the different lines desired . And so it is not surprising that we have found reasons for regarding the price system as it operates in the competitive industries , or as it can be made to operate by rnaintaining fair and full competition , as a kind of norm or standard for the regulation of the public service industries . We ought , so to speak , to regulate these latter industries in such a way as to make them conform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when equivalent service is given by their recipients to those from whom the incomes are ultimately drawn ; and we shall regard incomes as unearned when their recipients enjoy them without making a corresponding return . Whether such a distinction has any significance for any individual reader , will depend much on his ethical viewpoint , his general social philosophy . To one who regards absolute equality of incomes as the economic ideal , however great the differences in efficiency , an investigation into the question whether various incomes are earned or not , will seem irrelevant . Likewise , to one who regards the existence of privileged classes drawing large incomes , as a desirable condition of economic and social life , there will be little significance in a conclusion that many of these large incomes are wholly or partly unearned . But there are persons who believe , more or less on utilitarian grounds , that economic society is not well organized unless incomes have some reasonable relation to service rendered by the recipients to those from whom the incomes are in the last analysis , received , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charitable relief ) should be privileged to receive incomes not based on such service . To persons who hold this view , an analysis of incomes which leads eventually to their classification as earned and unearned may seem to be the most significant task which students of our economic system can undertake . Certain contemporary economists appear to think that classification of incomes according to sources is of no especial importance . In their view , the extent of inequality , as statistically ascertained , may be a matter of significance , and the fact that one man has an extremely large income while another is bitterly poor may even be distressing .  | But whether the one income or the other is derived from ( say ) labor or from the legal right to make others pay the recipient for the use of a part of the surface of the earth and for the enjoyment of community-produced advantages , is a matter with which only an economist unemancipated from classical traditions would concern himself ! Can we not imagine how an economist with this view of the irrelevance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The fact that the slave-owner 's income was derived from the labor of the slave would not be significant . Instead , it would be necessary to make a statistical study of the relative incomes of different persons in the community , both slaves and slave-owners . Such a study might then be pointed to as revealing the fact that no necessary relationship existed between a person 's income and his status as slave or slave-owner . Some slaves ? e.g. , the more favored domestic slaves of wealthy masters ? might be shown to be fairly prosperous . On the other hand , some slave-owners ? those owning only one or two slaves and little else and not managing these very effectively ? would appear to be very poor , poorer than some slaves . Into some such statistical investigation would well-to-do slave-owners ? and , probably , even poverty-stricken slave-owners ? prefer that any discussion of incomes should be diverted . And when questions are raised with regard to the sources of certain incomes in the present-day civilized world , some " modern " economists can seemingly find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamental is necessary if our study of economic society is to point the way to just and wise reform .  | By value , in the sense of value in exchange , we ordinarily mean the number of units of some other good or goods , taken as a standard or measure of value , ' that any given article or immaterial benefit will bring in trade . Thus , the value of a man 's horse may be 150 bushels of wheat or 30 tons of coal or 75 days of common labor or two dozen operatic performances . The thought is that the horse would sell for ? would bring in exchange ? such an amount of other goods . Since money is the medium by which exchanges are commonly effected and , therefore , a generally recognized measure of value , we ordinarily express exchange relations in terms of money . We should be much more likely to state the value of the horse as $160 than to state it as ( for example ) 30 tons of coal . Everyone sells goods for money or buys goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of the money unit in terms of various other goods . Everyone knows , that is , about how much of various other goods a dollar will buy . Consequently the statement that a horse is worth $160 includes the other statements and can be readily  | translated into them . Valuation of goods in terms of money is really valuation of them in terms of goods-in-general . Exchange value is a social phenomenon . It involves the exchanging of one kind of goods for another kind ( or kinds ) of goods and a comparison of the utility or desirability of the one kind with that of the other . Such a comparison will presumably be made , in fact , by both parties to an exchange . But though exchange value is thus a phenomenon involving human relations as well as involving goods and so is a social phenomenon , nevertheless nearly all of the factors that enter into its determination exist in a state of isolation such as that of a Robinson Crusoe . And so we may , perhaps , with advantage , begin our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might enter the mind of a Crusoe who , alone on his island , is engaged in eking out a precarious living . To Crusoe , as to a man in the most advanced modern community , must be presented frequently the necessity of making a choice among different commodities , all of which together he can not secure in anything like the number or quantity desired , and all of which , possibly , he can not use , since some may be substitutes for others . He must , therefore , compare the utility of one kind of goods with the utility of something else . It may be that he has occasion to decide whether a month 's labor which he can spare from other purposes shall be used to build an additional room to his hut or dugout , or whether it shall be used to make him a canoe ; whether today 's efforts shall be devoted to killing and dressing a goat or whether the day shall be spent in catching fish . There is , of course , for Crusoe , no value in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one with whom exchanges can be made . But there is value , if we may use the term in an analogous case , in the sense of comparison of one thing with some other thing or things , i.e. , there is comparative utility . If Crusoe would rather spend a month 's labor which he has available , in building an additional room than in constructing a canoe , it is probably because the utility of the room is greater to him than the utility of the canoe ,  | or , at any rate , that he believes it to be greater . If he could make the canoe in two weeks and a new goat-skin suit in another two weeks but would rather devote all four weeks to building the additional room , then the room has greater utility to him than the canoe and suit together ; or , if the canoe and suit are reckoned equal , the room has more than twice the utility of either . Were Crusoe in a small community with several other inhabitants , he would perhaps be willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in return for their building the additional room for him . Then we could say that the value of the room was two canoes or that a canoe was worth the half completed room . Crusoe , alone on his island , can make no trade ; but he can appraise the room in terms of canoes and clothes to the extent of deciding whether he will produce the one or the other two . Similar comparisons would be made in the case of goods satisfying somewhat the same need . For a quart of berries , Crusoe might be willing to work two hours and for a boiled lobster two hours . Then the lobster would be worth , to Crusoe , one quart of berries . Each article can be compared with each other , directly or through the common means of purchasing them all from nature , viz. , labor . We have now to take into consideration another fact , so far not mentioned . This is that successive units of any article or service have a progressively lower degree of utility . Crusoe 's one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , will have great utility to him , will be , in fact , indispensable . A second suit will be , perhaps , important but not as much so . A third will be comparatively unimportant . Similarly , a one-room shelter will be indispensable ; a second room may be almost indispensable ; a third will be a great convenience , a fourth somewhat convenient , and so on . It is certain that Crusoe will get himself enough food to support life , if he possibly can . It is pretty certain that he will build and keep in some repair one room . It is pretty certain that he will keep himself supplied with one suit of  | clothes . How much beyond these essentials he will go will depend upon his intensity of desire for comforts and luxuries and also upon his strength , energy and willingness to work . Having seen that the utility of any good diminishes for Crusoe according as he has a large amount of that good , let us reexamine our conclusion regarding the utility to him of a room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilities of these two items of wealth will depend on how much room Crusoe already has as well as upon his need for room in general or for a canoe . If he has no room at all , a one-room hut will probably seem much more important to him than a canoe , and , rather than go without it , he might be willing to do much more work than he would do for a small boat . But the utility of a second room would be less and that of a third still less . Suppose Crusoe would as soon have a canoe as to have the third room . Then he would be willing to devote as much labor to getting the one as to securing the other . If the time necessary to build an additional room is four weeks and that necessary to make a canoe is two weeks , he would choose the canoe after he had a sufficient number of rooms so that an additional room would have less than twice the ( marginal ) utility of a canoe . If , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice that of making a canoe , regardless of the number of rooms added , then this labor cost determines the number of rooms which Crusoe will build in preference to a canoe and , therefore , the marginal utility of a room ( the utility of the last , final or marginal room ) . The value of a room in terms of canoes will depend upon the utility of an additional room , but this utility will depend upon the number of rooms Crusoe already has and this , again , will depend upon the labor required to build a room . But suppose that the nearby available material for house building is scarce , that additional rooms necessitate longer ! rips for materials , and , perhaps , greater search to find materials that are satisfactory , ? in other words , that the  | labor of constructing additional rooms becomes progressively greater as more rooms are built . Then the labor of construction no more determines the utility and value of a room than its utility and value determine the amount of labor which Crusoe will undergo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms to Crusoe is little , he will construct but one or two rooms and the labor of construction will be slight ; whereas , if the utility of additional rooms is great , he will build them , in preference to a canoe , until the labor of construction ( per added room ) is considerable . Nevertheless it will still be true that when the utility of an additional room becomes less in relation to the labor of construction than is the utility of a canoe in relation to the labor of its construction , Crusoe will cease adding rooms and will turn to the building of a canoe . And the value of a room will still be measured by its utility in relation to the utility of a canoe , or by the labor of its construction in relation to the labor of constructing a canoe . Either method of measurement is correct since either is equivalent to the other . Having considered the principles determining the relative amounts of different goods that an isolated man will produce , and the values or the comparative utilities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to the considerations determining the total amount of such a man 's production . Of course Crusoe will produce necessary food . It is scarcely less certain that he will make himself some clothing and get at least a crude kind of shelter . His different wants will receive satisfaction in the order of and to the extent commensurate with their importance and the ease with which they can be satisfied . The wants remaining unsatisfied will  | he of progressively less importance in relation to the effort or other sacrifice necessary to satisfy them . On the other hand , additional hours of labor per day soon come to involve discomfort and sacrifice to an increasing degree . If Crusoe works thirteen hours , he will almost certainly find the thirteenth hour of labor harder than the tenth , eleventh or twelfth . lie will choose to work eight , ten , twelve or thirteen hours as the case may be , according to the relation between the utility to him of the goods which the last hour 's work produces and the disutility ( discomfort or labor sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance to him of the goods which his tenth hour produces is more than enough to compensate him for the work done , then he will work ten hours . Or , perhaps , at nine hours and three-quarters the last minute 's work just balances in sacrifice the gains to be secured . Then it will be a matter of indifference to him whether he works nine hours and forty-four minutes or nine hours and forty-five minutes , but he will not work nine hours and forty-six minutes . We have seen how an isolated man compares the utility of different objects and what considerations determine the amounts of them that he will produce . Let us now consider how values are determined in a community of persons , where there is division of labor and where , therefore , exchange of goods is a characteristic feature of economic life . In general , and with a qualification which will be made shortly , ' an isolated group of producers , or an entire community isolated from other communities , or society as a whole , produces to a larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , provided the sacrifice or cost of production is no greater , and produces to a less extent goods not so much desired .  | Suppose , for instance , that we are considering a community whose members desire large amounts of bread and , therefore , wheat , but only a small quantity of apples . Then large amounts of wheat will be produced and not many apples . But since the producers of wheat and of apples do not consume most of their own production , their relative tastes and preferences as between these two kinds of goods can not , to any large extent , act upon them directly . It is the tastes and preferences of buyers which affect price by influencing demand . Thus the large general demand for wheat means that there are many persons willing to pay a good price for it rather than not to have it or rather than to have less of it , that the amounts these persons are willing to purchase can be produced only by the labor of many wheat raisers , and that the prices which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make many persons willing to engage in ( and devote their land to ) wheat production . On the other hand , to say that apples are not greatly desired is to say that , unless the price is very low , there are few persons who want any or that those who want them want but small amounts , or both . It follows that large amounts can not be sold at a remunerative price and that the price consumers will pay is only high enough to keep a comparatively few producers ( and few acres ) in apple production , and is not high enough to tempt larger numbers into it . Of course if the apple growers do not receive almost as much for their work as the wheat raisers they may not consent , even in small numbers , to continue their occupation very long . But it is entirely possible that there will be a few who will like the work well enough to remain in it even if their return is very slightly less than it might be in the other line of production . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earning , perhaps , less than most wheat raisers , remain apple growers because they are not well adapted for wheat raising and would make even smaller returns in it . Similarly some land will be devoted to apple growing , even with a low price of apples and with consequent small returns to the owners of the land so used , because the land will produce even smaller returns i f  | used for the production of wheat . Furthermore , if there has been produced in the community in question a certain more or less necessary quantity of wheat , additional amounts of wheat will have so little utility that apples or other goods will be preferred . The conditions of demand and value will , therefore , encourage a larger production of wheat than of apples but not a production entirely devoted to wheat . Thus , in a considerable community , demand and the conditions of production determine the relative amounts of different goods which are produced . Variety of consumption results both from the fact that increasing amounts of any good reduce its marginal utility so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also from the fact that additional amounts of any kind of goods may cost more by requiring producers and land which , except for the offering of a high price , would be devoted to another line of production . And as with an isolated individual , a community labors , through the activities of its members , to produce goods up to the point where the sacrifice of production is just balanced by the satisfaction or utility or the anticipated satisfaction of consumption . But in an organized community of the modern industrial type , carrying on economic activities with a considerable degree of specialization or division of labor , the utility of any goods consumed , to the consumer , is not necessarily or even probably just equal to the disutility of producing them , to the producer . For in such a community each person engaged in productive activity produces goods or services which others enjoy . The labor sacrifice of the producers of hats may or may not ? probably will not ? be the exact equivalent of the enjoyment or anticipated enjoyment of the wearers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be of the variety affected by the well-to-do  | for formal evening wear , and may be , therefore , far removed from the list of necessities . The utility of or the satisfaction yielded by these hats may be comparatively slight , but they are purchased because , to their purchasers , the utility of money is also comparatively slight . Yet the disutility of the last hour 's work in making them , to the producers of the hats , may be considerable , far more than would be compensated by the enjoyment of such a luxury . These producers may be , for the most part , comparatively poor , so that the payment for the last hour of their labor represents necessities rather than luxuries . The necessities so purchased by them , although worth no more in the market than the hats which they have produced , have to these hat makers a utility corresponding to the labor sacrifice which they have to undergo in earning the necessities . Their necessities have , that is , a utility to them equal to the disutility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them , any such utility . On the other hand , the wearers of the hats may be engaged in producing ( or capital which their earlier efforts and saving have enabled them to accumulate may be instrumental in producing ) the very articles of necessity which the hat producers consume . The utility of these articles , or services , to those who consume them may therefore be much greater than the disutility ( of labor or saving ? or both ) required for their production by the classes engaged in producing them In modern industrial society , then , there is a rough correspondence between the utility of the goods which a man buys with the proceeds of his last hour of work , and the disutility of the work . But we can not , in such a society with its division of labor , its strata of wealthy and poorer classes , and its differences of individual energy and taste , assert any very marked correspondence between the utility of goods to a consumer and  | the disutility of labor , or labor and saving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of modern society means that different persons produce different things for a market , that we specialize in production and then trade to get what as individuals or family groups we want . The problem of value in such a society is the problem of explaining what factors determine the ratios of exchange between different kinds of goods . The explanation of the problem begins with a study of demand and supply . The price of any article is determined by the competitive forces of business , at that point which equalizes demand and supply . As has been frequently pointed out , demand must be distinguished from mere desire and supply must be distinguished from stock . There may be many persons who desire automobiles , but whose desires are of no significance economically because not backed by any financial ability to purchase . Demand implies ability to buy as well as desire to buy . Furthermore , since the amount which would be purchased by buyers depends partly on price , demand should be stated in relation to some price . We should therefore say , in defining demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cotton cloth , at any given price ( per yard ) is the amount ( number of yards ) of those goods which purchasers would take at that price . It is a generally recognized fact that demand is greater , other things equal , when price is lower , and that demand is less when price is higher . Assuming other things equal , we can suppose a complete schedule of demands , corresponding to all possible prices . All but one of these demands are hypothetical , since they correspond to prices  | that do not exist . They are , in each case , what the demand would be if the price of the goods were thus and so . The demand corresponding to the actual price , represents an actual demand . But the other demands , especially those corresponding to prices near the actual price , are important , because they stand for forces of competition which help to determine actual price . If the price should go lower , demand would increase and might exceed supply , thus bringing price back again to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of potential demands corresponding to a series of hypothetical prices ; yet we must , also , recognize that the actual demand for any article is the one which goes with the actual price or prices of that article during the period in question . Supply , also , needs to be carefully defined . The total stock , say of cotton , in existence at any time , is not the supply in the sense here used . Supply , like demand , should be spoken of in connection with price . The supply of any kind of goods , at any given price , is the amount which sellers would dispose of at that price . At a higher price , more persons would be encouraged to produce the goods for sale , and those already producing them might be inclined to produce more . At a lower price there would be less encouragement to the production of the goods . Even if we are dealing only with temporary or short-run supply , e.g. , the supply of corn in April , so that a rise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it might still be true that a higher price would tend towards a greater supply and vice versa . For at a price much below normal , many who otherwise might sell their corn , would be inclined to hold it in the hope of a higher future price . As in the case of demand , we may have a supply schedule with a supply corresponding to each assumed price ; and each such supply is hypothetical except the supply which corresponds to the actual price . But the hypothetical supplies are not to be ignored , since consideration of them enables us better to understand the nature of the competitive conditions by which price is fixed .  | Both demand and supply operate only during a period of time . This period of time may be longer or shorter according as the problem which interests us is long-run or short-run price . If we are considering the determination of so-called market price , our concern is with demand and supply during a brief period , e.g. , a week , a day , or an hour . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of corn or cotton , our concern is with demand and supply between one harvest and the next . If we are considering , for a certain manufactured good , the determination of the price corresponding in some degree to the seasonal price of an agricultural product , our concern is with demand and supply of this good during a period so short that additional plants for the manufacture of the good could not be constructed and so short that existing factories and machinery would not wear out . During such a period the good in question might be continuously produced , but the amount produced could not much exceed , though it might fall short of , the normal capacity of the plants . Finally , if we are considering long-run or normal price , our concern is with demand and supply over a longer period involving a number of seasons or , in the case of a manufactured good produced with large plant , involving a sufficient number of years so that the cost of construction of plants becomes an important influence on the supply of the articles produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the higher the price of a good , the larger ( other things equal ) will be the amount supplied , and the less will be the amount demanded . A high price , therefore , seems to be associated with a large supply and a low price with a large demand . This may appear to be contrary to the commonly accepted notion that high price means shortage of supply , or unusually large demand , or both . Yet in truth there is no inconsistency in the statement of these apparently opposite relationships . The phenomena in question involve an interaction of cause  | and effect . The prospect of being able to receive a high price for goods certainly stimulates the production of those goods . Yet a large production tends to force down the price . So , also , in the case of demand , it is certainly true that low prices of goods encourage purchases , and it is likewise true that large purchases tend to make prices high . Our present task is to examine the exact way in which the forces on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to determine price . The price of any kind of goods tends always to be fixed at that point where demand and supply are equal . To demonstrate this tendency , let us assume prices at which demand and supply are not equal and show that such prices involve unstable equilibrium and hence can not continue . We may suppose that , in a given market , a price of 8 cents a pound for cotton would equalize demand and supply and that , at such a price , both the demand and the supply would be 10,000,00() pounds . At 7 cents , the demand would be greater , say for 11,000,000 pounds , while the supply would be less , perhaps 9,000,000 pounds . Why , nevertheless , might not 7 cents be the resulting price ? The answer is to be found , not in a mere statement that demand then would exceed supply , but in an analysis of the conditions and forces of the market , for which the terms demand and supply are merely our mode of expression . Since , at a price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would aggregate 11,000,000 pounds , while , at that price , only 9,000,000 ) pounds would be forthcoming , not all of the prospective buyers willing to purchase at 7 cents , could get the desired amounts of cotton . Many of them would bid more than 7 cents rather than not get the cotton wanted and this bidding would force the price up . Any price lower than 8 cents would leave a preponderance of force on the demand side of the market , and would involve a further competitive bidding up of price . But we could not expect to have a bidding up of the price beyond 8 cents . For at 8 cents the supply is equal to the demand . In other words , all those who are willing to pay  | 8 cents a pound can get all the cotton which , at that price , they are willing to buy . No one of them has occasion to offer a higher price to insure his getting the desired amount of cotton . If any one of them , for any reason , chooses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not do so . For , by hypothesis , the supply at 8 cents a pound is enough to satisfy the demand . Hence , even after the purchases of any who for any reason pay more are completed , there will still be enough purchasable at 8 cents to satisfy the remainder of the demand . We see , then , that the conditions and forces of a market will not permit the continuance of a price below that which equalizes demand and supply , but that there is no reason why intending purchasers should pay more than this equalizing price . Let us now suppose a price above that which equalizes demand and supply , in order to see clearly that such a price , also , could not continue . At a price of ( say ) 9 cents a pound , the demand for cotton might aggregate not over 8,000,000 pounds ; while the supply would be more than at a price of 8 cents and might aggregate 11,000,000 pounds . Obviously , the 11,000,000 pounds which sellers might be willing to supply at a price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of at a price of 9 cents . Unless the price falls , some who are willing to sell for less than 9 cents rather than not sell , will be left with cotton on their hands . These will bid against each other in order to dispose of their cotton , and this bidding will lower the price to 8 cents . But it will not lower the price more than that , for all those who are willing to sell at 8 cents a pound can find purchasers . Should any sellers choose , for some unaccountable reason , to dispose of their cotton at a lower price , nevertheless others would not have to do likewise ; for the cotton supplied by these others at 8 cents a pound would be necessary to satisfy the demand and would , therefore , at this price , be purchased . We conclude that price is fixed , by market conditions , at a point such as to equalize demand and supply , since for price to be fixed at any other point involves a condition of unstable equilibrium .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there can be but one price for a given kind of goods , in any market and at any one time . Thus , some men would not be selling cotton in a market at 7 cents a pound at the same time that others were selling for 8 cents . For , if the dealers asking 7 cents could completely satisfy the demand , those asking 8 cents would make no sales ; while if those selling at 7 cents could not completely satisfy the demand , they would soon realize that a higher price could be asked . By a similar line of reasoning we may conclude that , if some purchasers were paying 8 cents and others only 7 cents , those having cotton to sell would sell it by preference to the former . If the purchasers at 8 cents could take the entire supply , those willing to pay but 7 cents would get no cotton , while , if the purchasers at 8 cents could not take the entire supply , they would soon realize that they could get what cotton they wanted without offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , that perfect competition makes impossible more than one price for any kind of goods in a given market at any given time , perfect competition must be understood to mean complete knowledge on the part of ' all the buyers and sellers , of conditions throughout the market , a readiness on the part of each buyer to buy where he can buy most cheaply , and a corresponding endeavor on the part of each seller to sell to whoever will pay the most . So far as knowledge is incomplete , or so far as buyers and sellers are actuated by motives not purely economic ( e.g. , by the motive of friendship ) , there is the possibility of two or more prices existing side by side in the same market . On the exchanges , where goods are bought and sold in such large quantities as to make the effort for complete information clearly worth while , there is seldom any great difference in price among different transactions in any one kind of goods , taking place at the same time . In retail trade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day are so small that it sometimes seems scarcely worth the trouble to investigate slight differences in price or to go much farther than the nearest store , differences in price are more likely to arise or to persist . Besides the possibility ? and , in some cases , probability ? of differences in the price of a kind of goods at any given time , there is also to be considered the likelihood  - -  almost the certainty ? that price will fluctuate from month to month , from week to week , from day to day , even from moment to moment . But some length of time is required for the carrying out of any transactions whatever . Demand and supply , therefore , almost necessarily have reference to a period of time rather than to an instant . It follows that , except as we imagine a period of time infinitesimally brief , we can not say with complete accuracy that demand and supply are equalized by any one price . Demand for and supply of wheat , during a year , are equalized by a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or by an average price . Either the seasonal price , or the long run or normal price is , then , an average of prices , an average of a series of prices differing somewhat from each other . Even the market price has reference rather to a very short period than to a point of time . It is often said , in explanation of a rise in the price of some commodity , that the demand for it has increased or that the supply has decreased ; and in explanation of a fall in price it is commonly stated that the demand has decreased or the supply increased . Obviously , an increased demand , say for cotton , which raises its price , is different from an increased demand which merely results from a fall of price . When we say that an increase of demand has raised the price of cotton , we mean that the potential demand at each possible price is greater than previously at  | the same price . In other words , the whole demand schedule has shifted . Substitutes may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or tastes and styles may have changed , so that cotton goods are more desired than formerly . Unless , therefore , price is higher , demand will exceed supply , buyers will bid against each other , and price will have to rise . Likewise , if it is said that the price of cotton rises because of a decreased supply , this must be held to mean , not that there is a decreased supply consequent on a lower price , but that there is , at each assumed price , a less potential supply than formerly would have been forthcoming at that price . This fact might be the result of soil exhaustion or of a possibility of using land more profitably for some other crop or ( as for a single season ) of destruction of part of the crop by the boll weevil . In any of these cases demand , at the former price , would exceed supply , and , therefore , a higher price must result . Consider now the conditions which make for a fall in price . The increase of supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which results from a larger demand and a higher price , but is an increase of supply due to other conditions than a rise of price . It may be due to improved methods of cultivation or ( as for a single season ) to exceptionally favorable weather conditions . Unless the price falls , there will then be an excess of supply over demand . Sellers of the cotton therefore bid against each other in price reduction , causing the price to be fixed at a point such that the demand will be equal to the now larger supply . But price may be lowered , also , through a decreased demand . This decreased demand must be supposed to be a demand smaller at each price and not a smaller demand consequent merely on a higher price . It may result from change of taste or style or from inability of part of the buyers , owing to changed conditions diminishing their prosperity , to make their desires effective in demand . In any  | such case only a lower price can equalize demand and supply . The case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also , is fixed where demand and supply are equal . But the monopolist controls the supply of his product and can therefore ordinarily fix his price so as to secure a larger net return than would be possible if competition had to be met . But if , in any industry , monopoly seems inevitable or socially preferable , government may regulate the price or prices in question . Such regulation , if effective , will remove the motive to limitation of supply . The regulated monopoly will rather prefer to extend its business , as the only way of making a considerable profit . To regulate any price to a lower point than gives a normal competitive return to the factors engaged in the production of the good , will cause these factors to be shifted , in part , to other lines of production . If such a law is not evaded , it can only be because its penalties or other causes bring about an appreciable curtailment of demand for the good the price of which is regulated . But to regulate monopoly price down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase supply than to decrease it . It has been above pointed out that the price of any kind of goods may fluctuate from week to week or from  | month to month . This fluctuation is , however , limited in extent by the activities of speculators , at least when speculation is intelligently carried on . We might be inclined to expect that the price of ( say ) wheat would be very low immediately after harvest , because of the large quantity suddenly thrown on the market , that this lowness of price would discourage its production , and that its scarcity , realized particularly when each season 's stock was nearly gone , would cause its price then to be very high . But speculators see chances to make profit from such differences of price . They , therefore , buy up the wheat in the fall , when its price is low , and hold it for sale at a time when a greater relative need makes its price higher . The large purchases in the fall tend to keep the price of wheat from going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a considerable stock into the spring for sale then , tends to prevent so great a rise as might otherwise occur . Speculative holding , in other words , increases the demand when price is low and increases the supply when price is high . The difference between the low and high prices will therefore , perhaps , on the average , about pay for the cost of storage , including interest on the capital furnished by the speculator . It is doubtless true that , in the absence of a speculating class , many farmers would themselves be inclined to hold their wheat till the season of highest price , but many would find this expensive , inconvenient and risky . At any rate , the existence of a class of speculative buyers enables the farmers to sell at once for somewhere near the later and ( on the average ) higher price , and to avoid risk of loss . It may , therefore , somewhat encourage wheat production and thus tend towards a reasonably low average price to the public . It is , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period to equalize prices . So far as the untrained and uninformed public may be lured into the spec- ulative use of funds by the hope of large chance gains , the effect is perhaps as likely to be greater price fluctuations as less . For the untrained and uninformed are not unlikely to purchase when prices are high , and to sell ? or have to sell , e.g. , if their purchases are with the aid of borrowed funds ? when prices are low . The modern development of cold storage operates to make possible for goods which could not previously be stored without great and rapid spoilage , a similar , though doubtless less , equalization of prices throughout the year . Apples are put into cold storage in the fall and are taken out and sold , gradually , over several successive months . Eggs are bought speculatively in the spring , when they are plentiful , for storage , and are thus made available to the public in later months ( e.g. , the succeeding winter ) when they would otherwise be relatively scarce . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply the principles of demand and supply to the general level of prices . We shall see that much the same kinds of competitive forces which fix any one price ( as above explained ) in relation to other prices , fix the general level of prices of goods in terms of money . We shall consider the supply of goods , including the services of labor and of " waiting " ( i.e. , investing , or putting capital into use , the service for which interest is paid ) , offered for money , and the demand for goods by those having money to spend . Where there is only fiat ( inconvertible paper ) money , the supply of goods in general , offered for money , at any  | level of average prices of those goods , would be just the same as at any other level of prices . This is very nearly true no matter what the money system If wheat prices rise relatively to corn prices , or vice versa , production may be diverted from one line into another . But we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are discussing only changes in the general level of prices , the average of prices . If the general level of prices should double , there is no reason to believe that the amount of goods produced for sale would on that account greatly increase . Supposing a community to be in reasonable prosperity and business activity at the lower prices , an increase of these prices would not make possible a very greatly increased production . It would not enable men to work longer hours nor would it make machinery more efficient . Neither would it stimulate the sales of goods by making such sales more profitable , since a general rise of prices simply means that money has a less value . If everything should sell for twice as much money as before , the sellers would gain nothing , for the things they desire to buy would also cost twice as much . Looking at the matter from any reasonable point of view , it must be admitted that the supply of goods in general , at a higher level of prices , would be no greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower level . Likewise , at a lower level of prices , the supply of goods would be no less than at a higher one . A lower level of prices would not mean less activity or a smaller sale of goods . It would pay as well to sell goods at a low level of prices as at a high level , since at the lower level the money received would have correspondingly greater purchasing power . ( This is not to deny , however , that there may be disturbing effects during the process of transition from higher prices to lower ones . ) The lower level of prices would only decrease the supply of other goods and the higher level increase it , in one con- tingency , and then only to a very limited degree . When the currency system is based on a precious metal , e.g. , gold , a lower level of prices means a higher value of gold as money . It might therefore divert some labor from the production of other goods to the production of gold for money . A higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to divert labor from gold production towards the production of other goods . To this extent only , a higher level of prices would tend to increase the supply of goods in general other than money , and a lower level of prices to decrease it . On the other hand , a higher level of prices of goods would tend to decrease the demand for goods by persons having money to spend . For with higher prices , and no greater amount of money to spend , buyers of goods would be unable to purchase as much as at lower prices . Lower prices of goods would mean that the money of purchasers would go farther . Let us now suppose a doubling of the amount of money . Prices would tend to increase in nearly the same proportion . Suppose prices did not rise . Then purchasers of goods would buy all they were in the habit of buying and still have as much money left to spend as they formerly spent altogether . This they would presumably spend . For in modern countries money is not generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for emergency requirements , and the rest is spent . Those who save are spending just as effectually as any others . The difference is in what they buy . Those who save buy factories , warehouses , railroads , farms , etc . Even though their savings are put into a savings bank , they are none the less spent for investment goods . It follows that a sudden doubling of the amount of money , if prices did not increase , would mean a demand for goods far exceeding the supply . The amount of land is practically constant . Doubling the amount of money would not enable people to work longer hours and so increase the products of labor . In a busy community the supply of goods to be sold simply could not be doubled  | except with an increase of population or invention . The increased money would therefore mean that at the old prices the demand for goods in general would exceed the supply . Purchasers would bid against each other . Prices would rise . Equilibrium would only be reached , supply and demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or , if fiat money , quite ) twice that which had preceded . In a country which has a gold standard monetary system prices are largely dependent upon the amount of gold mined and hence upon the number and richness of gold mines . If prices rose equally , this would mean a doubling in the money wages of labor for the same results produced and , similarly , a doubling in the money interest received for " waiting . " Aside from disturbing effects during the  | period of transition , the rate of interest would be the same with the high prices as with the low . The money value of the sum waited for would be doubled and the money value of the interest would be doubled . The ratio between them would be the same as before . In other words , since prices have doubled , borrowers , for example , would require twice as many dollars as before and would also , of course , pay twice as many dollars in interest . In the light of the principles above set forth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excessive amounts of inconvertible paper money sometimes issued by governments , issued particularly in time of war , have resulted in very exceptional rises in the price level . This increased amount of money means , at any level of prices , a greater demand for goods . Therefore , that the demand for goods may not exceed the supply , the level of prices  | must rise . And the prospect of a still greater and rapid rise of prices causes those who have money , not to hoard it but to spend it at once for goods , thus further increasing demand and prices . Indeed , with a very rapid depreciation of money some would-be sellers of property may resort to barter or may simply refuse to sell , lest in the interval before they can conveniently spend the money they receive , prices will have greatly risen . This decrease in the supply of goods , offered for money , will mean that only a level of prices even higher than otherwise would result can equalize supply and demand . Credit instruments , or credit rights ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the underlying obligation ? act as substitutes for money primarily through the intermediation of commercial banking . Commercial banks constitute an important part of the mechanism of trade . Their work facilitates internal trade and , in connection with foreign exchange transactions , facilitates external trade as well . It is estimated that nine-tenths of the total business in the United States is carried on through the use of bank credit . Bank deposits ( rights to draw from a bank or banks ) , which circulate by means of checks , may come into being in any one of several ways . One may become a depositor by directly depositing money ( or the right to draw money , received by check from some one else , but this merely registers a transfer of a deposit and does not create one ) . One may become a depositor by borrowing from the bank in which the deposit is to be . If A goes to his bank and leaves there $50,000 cash , he thereupon is said to have deposited such an amount in the bank and can draw on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of any persons to whom he wishes to make payments . But A may also go to the same bank , give his note , supported by collateral if required , and borrow $50,000 . This money he leaves on deposit . The bank is then said to lend its credit . What A has borrowed is not money but the right to draw money by check , at will . The bank is under as much obligation to redeem his checks on demand as if he had directly put money into the bank . On the other hand , A is under obligation to pay the bank , when his note matures , the amount borrowed plus interest . Finally , one may also become a depositor by indorsing to his bank a note or draft payable by a third party who then is the real borrower . It should be readily apparent that a bank can , in ordinary times , redeem all checks presented for redemption , without keeping for that purpose a cash reserve which at all nearly equals its liabilities . The total value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on demand , may be $800,000 . Yet it is certain that all the depositors will not call for their money at the same time . Instead of drawing it out , most of them send checks back and forth to and from others who do likewise . A cash reserve of $100,000 may be ample . Putting the matter in the opposite way , we may assert that the banks as a whole can lend , in the form of deposits or rights to draw , several times their aggregate reserves . We have said that different depositors in a bank liquidate their obligations to each other by giving checks . There is , then , simply a change on the bank 's books . Any amount of obligations can be thus balanced . Different persons are made successively creditors of the bank for larger or smaller sums . The situation is complicated , but the principle is not changed , when depositors of different banks have business dealings with each other . In this case , which is a decidedly usual one , the banks become successively each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clearing house . Bank A may have accepted and paid cash  | for , or credited to depositors , many checks on Bank B. Bank B therefore owes Bank A. Similarly , Bank C may owe Bank B , &c.; All of these complicated obligations are balanced by a clearing house , so that each bank pays what it owes net or receives what is owed to it net , and a great deal of flow of money is avoided . In other words , the principle of cancellation is applied whenever possible between banks , just as it is in any one bank to the depositors in it . In the United States , settlements between banks in different towns and cities are made through the Federal Reserve banks . If the currency of a country is based on a fixed weight of gold , the extensive use of bank credit will , by maintaining a higher general level of prices and thereby a lower value of the dollar or other monetary unit , cause some gold which might otherwise be turned in to the government for money ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arts . The volume of money in circulation will be less , a larger quantity of gold will be used in the arts , gold in all uses will have less value compared to other goods and it can not profitably be produced from such unfavorable sources of supply . The amount of gold mined will then , of course , be smaller . But if bank credit in some degree takes the place of money , is there any limit to such substitution ? Why might not credit expand and prices rise , or money be pushed out , indefinitely ? The answer is that the amount of bank credit is more or less definitely related both to bank reserves and to the volume of money in circulation . The amount required as bank reserves bears a relation to the amount of bank credit . For national banks of the United States and Federal Reserve banks , as well as for state banks , a reserve is required by law . ( All of the legally required reserves of member banks of the Federal Reserve system must be kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total bank credit is related to the total bank reserves or cash in the banks . Banks maintain the proper relation between deposits and reserves , by adjusting their rates of interest ( or  | discount ) charged to borrowers . If the deposits are in danger of becoming too great , relative to the reserves , a higher charge to borrowers will discourage borrowing , and so will limit the increase of those deposits which originate in the borrowing of deposit rights ( or in the discounting of promissory notes and commercial drafts ) . But a central bank or , in the United States , the Federal Reserve system , can , by maintaining reserves in excess of minimum requirements , make the connection between bank deposits and bank reserves a most elastic one . The total bank credit is related , also , to the total cash in circulation . Bank deposits passed by means of checks are absolutely unavailable for very many transactions . They are unavailable when the maker of a check is unknown , and they are unavailable , practically , for small payrnents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , notes can not fill up the entire circulation when , as is usually the case , the government allows them to be issued only in relatively large denominations . The smaller denominations are needed and government money is used . Business convenience , then , also compels a relationship between the quantity of bank credit and the quantity of government money . Since the quantity of bank credit is related in these two ways to the quantity of government coined and government issued money , changes in the latter tend to bring proportionate changes in the former . It is still true that prices depend upon the quantity of money , though the dependence is in part indirect and there is a possibility of considerable price-level control by a central bank or banks , such as the Federal Reserve banks in the United States . The demand for goods comes from those who have bank credit to offer as well as from those who have only money . We began our study of value by assuming the simplest possible situation in which the principal value-determining  | forces might work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though in such a situation no exchanges are possible and , therefore , no value , in the sense of power in exchange , is possible , there may nevertheless be comparisons of utility . Such an isolated man may choose to produce one thing instead of another because its utility is greater to him than the utility of the other , in relation to the time and intensity of labor necessary to produce it . It is likewise true for a person so situated , as for a person in a modern community , that a given unit of any good has less utility according as he possesses many units . If one kind of good has , because he possesses little of it , greater utility to him than another , and is yet no harder to produce , he will devote his attention to producing it instead of the other until the relative utilities are as the relative sacrifices or costs of its production . But this adjustment may be reached either because the utility of the desired good becomes less as more of it is possessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in proportion when more is wanted , or for both reasons . Some wants will eventually remain unsatisfied because they are not important enough to warrant the sacrifices of production , sacrifices which are likely to grow greater in proportion to the results obtained , as more hours per day are devoted to labor . In a modern community , the relatively large production of the most desired goods is brought about through the influence of desire upon demand and of demand upon the profitableness of supplying these goods . The principle of diminishing utility still applies and each purchaser buys goods desired by him only up to the point where the last unit purchased has a utility equal to the utility of the money which must be paid for it , which will be equal to the utility of the most desired alternative purchase that might have been made with the money . The goods which are generally so desired in quantity that the average purchaser buys much before their utility becomes as low as the price , are goods which , therefore , it pays to produce in large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are devoted to producing these goods . In a general way , we can state that producers carry on productive effort up to the point where its discomfort , weariness or disutility balances the satisfaction or utility which is the reward of that effort . But we can not say that the disutility of productive effort , to the producer , equals the utility of the goods produced , to the consumer . A modern community is made up of specializing units ; specialization requires exchange ; and exchange involves a rate or rates of exchange . In other words , exchange involves demand and supply . It is the forces of the market which fix the price of any good at the point where demand and supply are equal . At a lower price , demand would exceed supply and buyers would bid against each other , so raising the price . At a higher price , supply would exceed demand and sellers would bid against each other in order to dispose of the goods . Demand , supply and price have reference to a period of time which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market , seasonal or normal price . Speculative buying and holding for a rise tends to keep up the prices of agricultural products when they first come upon the market and to prevent scarcity and high prices later . But speculation by persons inexpert in it may tend to increase price fluctuations instead of to diminish them . The general average of prices or price level is also determined by demand and supply and largely resolves itself into a relation between the volume of purchasing power in the form of money and bank deposit ( checking ) accounts on the one hand and the volume of trade on the other hand . In concluding this chapter it may be worth while to emphasize the fact that , as society is now organized , prices are the inducements by which men are persuaded to dispose of goods , to lend , and to produce goods for disposal and that we produce and sell one or some things in order that we may buy other things ; and to point out that the price system is a system which leaves those within it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods  | as they choose . They may , indeed , be often subject to the compulsion of circumstances but they are not subject to any other compulsion . If , in a system which thus allows choice of occupations , one line of industry pays better , all things considered , than another line , those persons engaged in the second line are at liberty to enter the first . But to enter it and sell their product they have to bid down its price , i.e. , compete . They then become buyers of what they previously produced and to get this they may have to bid up its price . Coercive systems of industry , on the other hand , are not unknown to historians and to dreamers of Utopias . Slavery was , and is , coercive . Feudalism , with its accompanying serfdom , was coercive to the serf . The caste system of India is coercive . And any variety of socialism which , in the desire of its apostles to avoid the alleged evils of competition or for any other reason , regulates what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must certainly be regarded as coercive .  | If our explanation of the determination of value is to approximate completeness , we must not stop with an analysis of the nature of demand and supply , but we must bring into view the forces which lie back of each . We shall begin with demand . It was said in the last chapter that desire is not demand . Nevertheless , desire is related to demand as ( part ) cause to effect . Demand depends upon desire for goods coupled with ability to pay for them . Other things equal , the greater the desire for any goods , the greater the demand for them . The desire of an isolated man for goods of any kind , expresses itself in his efforts to produce these goods . But where , as in a modern community , there is division of labor , each member of the community specializing in some one line , demand for any good on the part of producers of other things , expresses itself in their production of these other things for a market , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they desire . In effect , though the use of money intervenes , they buy the goods they desire with the goods they produce . if a farmer desires a piano , an automobile , good furniture and various other things , he works longer hours or more intensively and produces more wheat , cotton , corn or beef .  | Thus the goods of one kind , which he supplies , express and give effect to his demand for other goods . It is this fact which lay back of the contention of the classical economists , that there could be no such thing as a general oversupply , i.e. the supply of a larger amount of all kinds of goods than could be sold . There might be , through miscalculation of producers , or other cause , an oversupply of one or a few kinds of goods compared to other goods . But this simply meant that the producers of the goods supplied in excess , say cotton , had plenty of those goods with which to purchase other goods . They had produced what , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods desired . That is , they had intended to produce marketable goods . They had mistakenly produced too much of one thing ( or a few things ) . But to assume that nothing they could have produced would have been acceptable to those with whom they traded , would be to assume that the latter had no wants remaining unsatisfied , for the satisfaction of which they were willing to pay . But if , in our system of division of labor , these latter , the purchasers of cotton , have produced any goods , it must be because they desire and , therefore , have a demand for , other goods , such as cotton . Though they do not desire ( and , except at low prices , will not take ) all of the cotton which has been too freely produced , they do desire other goods and have produced the wherewithal to pay for them . In other words , people produce goods in modern society chiefly as a means of securing other goods . Production of goods by a person who intends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants something else , that his wants are not satisfied . What he wants to buy may be factories , railroad shares , office buildings and tenements , but it is pretty certain that he wants to buy something or to hire men to make something . If he lends his money to another person , the situation remains the same in practical effect , for the borrower merely takes his place as a buyer . And if he buts his  | money into a savings bank , he makes the savings bank his agent . The bank may purchase bonds from a corporation or it may lend , on the security ( say ) of a mortgage , to an individual . The money deposited in the bank is then spent by such corporation or individual in the purchase of goods or in the hiring of labor ( and land and capital ) to produce goods . General overproduction would mean , then , a more or less universal production of goods for sale , by persons who did not want other goods in exchange for the goods sold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corresponding desire to buy goods . Since , in general , men sell only that they may buy , such a situation as a general phenomenon is almost unthinkable . It may seem to exist temporarily , and for special reasons , during a panic and business disorganization , but it is very far from being a normal condition of economic life ; nor can general oversupply , though seeming to exist during such a business breakdown because merchants and manufacturers are afraid to buy the usual amounts of goods , raw material and machinery , be put forth as a cause of the breakdown . In fact , the refusal of dealers and manufacturers to buy does cause it to appear that there is a surplus of goods , discourages manufacturers of those goods , throws men out of work , deprives these men of the means of purchasing , and so accentuates the appearance of superfluity . But the condition is one of industrial breakdown rather than of too efficient industrial functioning . Provided our economic machinery works  | smoothly , we need not fear a superfluity of goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real difficulty is to be sought elsewhere . In Chapter VI , we concluded that sharp contraction of bank credit causes such apparent superfluity . Before leaving this general topic , let us examine , briefly , the view sometimes expressed that invention , by enabling the same amount of goods to be produced with less labor , must occasion widespread unemployment . Suppose an automobile , previously priced at $2,000 , can now be made with much less labor and so can sell for $1,000 . Clearly , the saving to consumers ( assuming no monopoly control ) of $1,000 per car enables them to buy other goods which they could previously not afford to buy . Thus , though less labor than before may be needed to produce automobiles , correspondingly more labor is needed in these other lines .  | In so far , of course , as monopoly control might prevent the lowering of price which the new and cheaper method of production of cars ought to bring , increased ability of consumers to buy other goods does not result . In general , in so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the monopolized lines , demand for goods by consumers must be reduced and employment be decreased , except as lower prices , and presumably lower wages , in other lines make possible the employment of the displaced labor and the sale of its output . Such lower prices in other lines , and lower wages for labor , will normally come , for the displaced labor must seek employment and its output , if the labor is to be employed , must sell at prices low enough to permit the output to be disposed of . This is merely saying that the high prices of monopolized goods operate to force other prices down and that the gains of monopolists are realized at the expense of the rest of the public . But improvements in production which are not withheld from the public by monopoly tend , in the absence of decrease in circulating medium , to make as many new opportunities for employment as they shut off old ones . It is to be noted that the tendency of improvement to lower prices will be offset if there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , though average prices do not fall , average money incomes rise . Therefore , the public is equally able to buy the increased output of goods . Intensity of demand for goods shows itself , as has been above stated , in intensity of effort devoted to producing other goods with which to buy them . But intensity of demand for any one kind ( or a few kinds ) of goods , may show itself also in a smaller consumption of other kinds , and in using most of one 's available purchasing power to buy the goods most wanted . In other words , our estimates of relative utility inevitably involve not one but two comparisons or sets  | of comparisons . We must compare the utility of goods desired with the cost of the goods in terms of what we produce to pay for them and , therefore , in terms of the disutility ( of effort and other sacrifice ) involved in producing the latter goods . We must also compare the utility of any special goods desired with the utility of other goods which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power is not unlimited , may have to be sacrificed if the special goods most wanted are bought . To illustrate , a farmer 's desire for a piano may cause him to work longer hours and cultivate his farm more intensively , in order to produce the extra amount of wheat necessary for purchasing the piano without greatly sacrificing his other needs . His sacrifice takes then the form of the extra effort required to earn the requisite money . On the other hand , his desire for the piano may , conceivably , cause him to work no harder but may induce him to give up owning an automobile . In that case , his sacrifice takes a different form , but may be regarded as none the less a sacrifice . The same principle applies to anything which one may purchase , ? coal , shoes , sugar , etc . We have already seen that as a person has more and more units of any article , the utility or desirability of additional units declines . A pound of sugar , to a man who could never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A second pound would be somewhat less desired but would yet have high utility . But to a man who regularly consumes 75 pounds of sugar a year , one pound more or less is of relative unimportance . In the case of some goods , utility would diminish rapidly as the amount owned increased . In the case of other goods , utility would diminish slowly . In any case , a person desiring the goods would purchase them up to the point where the last unit secured was just equal , in his mind , to the price paid . The purchaser of sugar would buy each year or each month such an amount that the last pound purchased would just about seem worth while getting at the price . The  | purchaser of coal would buy , each winter , such a number of tons that the last ton would just about seem worth the price paid . If the price were lower he might luxuriate in more heat . If it were much higher , he might endeavor to get along with one less heated room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the equivalent , in utility , of the money spent for it or ( since money has utility only for what it can buy ) of the other goods which could have been secured with the price of that ton but which are sacrificed in order to get the coal . This last ton being just equal in utility to the money necessary for its purchase , would just compensate for the disutility ( labor or other sacrifice ) involved in earning that last addition to the year 's income . This statement remains true in principle even when the assumed purchaser of goods finds labor a constant delight . For such labor still involves a sacrifice of sleep , or leisure or reflection , which may be no less or even more delightful to him . As to the person who gets all or nearly all his income from property , it can hardly be said that the last hour 's work has any disutility at all . But , even so , goods may still be valued in terms of other goods foregone . The last ton of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , marginal utility , the effort or other sacrifice necessary to earn that much more ( e.g. , the last and , therefore , hardest or most disagreeable hour 's work , if work must be undergone ) is the marginal effort or sacrifice , and its disutility is the marginal disutility . At the point where the coal purchasing stops , the marginal utility of coal is just equal to the marginal utility of its money price or of the goods other than coal for which the money might be spent and , if the money had to be earned , is just about equal to the marginal disutility of earning that money . It may be objected that much buying is done on impulse or from habit , with no careful weighing of com- parative utilities , no real consideration by the purchaser as to whether he can " afford " to buy or to buy so much . The rich may just " buy all they want " of all desired goods not superlatively expensive . Nevertheless , most people have to and do pay attention to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very cheapest of desired goods and they do , also , however carelessly and unintelligently , compare the advantages of different goods and spend their money on the basis , largely , of their consciously felt needs and desires . We may now restate the relation of demand to price , pointing out that demand rises as price falls and that this is true partly because a fall of price induces some to be purchasers who would not buy at a high price , and partly because those who would buy at a high price will buy more if price is lower . A further statement may be made , which has to do with both demand and supply . A great rise in the price of ( say ) wheat , would tend to decrease the demand for wheat by persons producing other goods to get it , partly because it would induce some to give up producing the means of purchasing wheat and to produce , instead , the wheat itself . On the other hand , a great decrease in the price of wheat ( resulting , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved methods of soil enrichment ) , would tend to increase the demand for it by causing some who had been producers of wheat , to produce other things and therewith buy wheat . Otherwise putting the matter , we may say that the amount which would be paid for wheat in terms of other goods , is roughly limited ( if we have long periods and possible change of occupation , in view ) to the amount of other goods which could be produced with the same ( marginal ) sacrifice as the wheat . A price of wheat so high that it is much more difficult to  | get the wheat desired , by producing other goods with which to buy it , than to produce the wheat itself , would mean a smaller demand for wheat , ? and demand and supply would only be equalized , in the long run , by a shifting of a part of the community 's producing power into wheat production . Who of us does not know , too , individuals who have , at least in part , made their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production of garden produce or eggs or both for their own tables , or , even , persons who have mostly constructed their own houses ? Does not such activity clearly involve a comparison , in the minds of these persons , of the prices they would have to pay for the goods in question and the money incomes or other satisfactions they might secure from a different use of their time ? There is a very real sense , then , in which the demand for an article , and the amount which consumers will pay for it , depends upon its cost of production . They will not , in the long run , pay more for it than the amount of other goods which the same sacrifice will produce . Normal or long run demand may therefore be said to depend on the utility or desirability of the goods demanded , on the utility or desirability of the other goods which will have to he sacrificed if these are enjoyed , on the disutility or sacrifice of producing the goods necessary to pay for the desired goods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or sacrifice  | necessary to produce , instead of buying , the goods desired . Cost of production has often been spoken of as if it influenced only supply of goods and not demand . But this , if the position here taken can be justified , is not consistent with a broad philosophical view of the phenomena in question . Conditions of cost influence demand no less than supply , even though their influence on demand is not obvious without a philosophical analysis of economic relations . This point has importance in the distinction between goods which have and goods which have not any cost of production , i.e. , between goods which are reproducible and goods which are almost or absolutely fixed in quantity . Ordinary commodities are in the first class . Land space is in the second class . The demand for ordinary commodities depends not only upon their utility , but in part , as we have seen , upon their cost of production , for the majority of people will not long pay for any good more than this cost , i.e. , more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. , would produces But the demand for land space depends ( assuming any given prices ) solely on its utility , for it has no cost of production . At any set of prices for the different pieces of land in a community , the demand would be almost totally unaffected by any possibility of producing the desired land instead of buying it , for , on the whole , and with a few exceptions of made land , there is no such possibility . Buyers of land  | would purchase it up to the point where its utility , for their purposes , equaled its price . At a low set of prices , more land would be bought than at higher prices . But if the land were sufficiently desired by purchasers , to make the prices high , their demand would not be likely to be limited by any alternative of shifting their industry and becoming producers of land . To an extent , land fertility can be produced by human effort but , practically speaking , land space can not be . And the situation advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced through the building of roads and railroads , the grouping of the tributary population which trades through a given city , etc. , can not be produced or duplicated by an individual or , ordinarily , in any appreciable degree , by a group of individuals such as a corporation . These situation advantages are the result of the activities of millions of persons , each following his own inclinations . The individual is not responsible for them and can not produce them . Let us now analyze the supply side of the market in the same way . The supply of any good , e.g. , cotton , depends , first , on the price that can be realized for it , per pound , i.e. , ultimately on the amount of other desired goods obtainable in exchange for the cotton . A higher price would encourage larger production . Second , the supply of cotton depends upon the intensity of desire for these other goods securable in exchange by the producers of cotton . Supposing the inten-sity of desire for these goods on the part of cotton producers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cotton with which to buy these other goods . Assuming their desire for other goods to be weak and easily satisfied , they would care less to produce large amounts of cotton with which to buy these other goods . If the producers of cotton and of the other goods for which it is given are alike members of a single homogeneous population , able to  | change easily in large groups , from one occupation to another , the intense or weak demand of cotton producers for other goods will indicate an intense or weak demand in the whole community for goods in general , probably including cotton , and may not imply any special effect on the value of cotton in relation to other goods . But if , as is the case , cotton is producible only in certain climates , and if those who live and work in those climates are persons whose wants are slight and easily satisfied , the effect on the supply of cotton may be important . In trade between highly civilized countries on the one hand and primitive peoples on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter for anything beyond a few simple necessaries of life , tends ( assuming their labor to be wholly voluntary ) to restrict the supply of the goods they produce and so to raise the prices of such goods . This result will not follow , of course , if the goods in question can be cheaply produced in the civilized country . Third , the supply of cotton may depend upon the disutility of producing it , i.e. , the unpleasantness or difficulty of or disinclination to do the work or make the accumulations of capital used in producing the cotton . Thus , if exhaustion of the soil should increase the labor per pound of producing cotton , this would discourage its production and , if only the same price as before could be secured , less and perhaps much less cotton would be produced than before . On the other hand , should improvements in machinery and in methods of soil culture make the labor cost per pound of cotton less than before , the production of cotton would be encouraged and , at the same price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced and sold . Summarizing our conclusions thus far and restating them , we may say that producers of cotton will supply it up to the point where the ( marginal ) disutility to them of producing it is just balanced by the ( marginal ) utility to then of the goods which they get in exchange . But in presenting the above considerations , we hay  | failed to emphasize an influence to which the greatest importance should be attributed . This is the influence exerted by comparison , in the minds of producers , of the various ways of getting what they want as consumers . Thus , the producers of cotton are producing it , in large part , as the most effective way , for them , of securing wheat , bacon , sugar , etc . Should the price of cotton greatly fall or of these other things greatly rise , so that the produce of a year 's labor in cotton raising would purchase much less than before of these other things , some of the cotton producers ( or persons who would have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to producing goods other than cotton , which they could more profitably exchange for the various goods they desired , or to producing , themselves , some of these desired goods instead of buying them with cotton . We may , indeed , regard the cost of production of cotton as being the amount of other goods , of one and another sort , which the same effort and self denial would produce and the production of which the cotton raisers forego when they raise cotton . Assuming the possibility of an easy shifting of occupations , they will not care to produce cotton if they have to dispose of it for much less than that amount of other goods which the same effort and sacrifice would produce . To say that they must take less than this , is to say that some other line ( or lines ) of production is ( or are ) more profitable than cotton raising , and such a condition would tend to decrease the supply of cotton . On the supply side then , as on the demand side of the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of production is an important consideration , cost of production being understood to mean the amount of other goods which the same effort and sacrifice would produce . Purchasers do not wish to pay more than this cost of production and  | will , in large part , change their occupations and cease to appear on the demand side of the market , if they do have to pay more . Sellers do not wish to take less than this cost of production and will , in large part , change their occupations , and cease to appear on the supply side of the market if they do have to take less . It need not surprise us that demand and supply are thus both so closely related to cost in the sense of the word here used . Let us remember that those who demand one kind or several kinds of goods , supply other goods , and that those who supply one kind of goods demand other kinds . The demander is a supplier and vice versa . Every person is at the same time a buyer of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , in a modern society based on industrial freedom , has the alternative of becoming a buyer of what he now sells and a seller of what he now buys . In fact , every industrial unit has many alternatives and all of them are determining conditions of his action as an economic unit in industrial society . When buyers , taking them as a whole , refuse , in the long run , to pay for a good more than its cost of production , and when sellers , taking them as a whole , refuse , in the long run , to accept less , both groups are influenced , not only by their available alternatives of varying their consumption in amount or in proportions and of varying the intensity or degree of their productive efforts and other sacrifices , but also , and , for many economic problems , most importantly , by their alternative of shifting their fields of industrial activity . "  | But attention should be called , also , to the fact that supply is affected , as demand is , by calculations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may well be influenced in the amount of milk he supplies to the market , by a comparison of the utility of milk to his own family and the utility of the other goods ( other food , perhaps ) which he might purchase with the money he could get for it . If the price of milk is relatively low , he and his family may consume more milk and , therefore , he can sell less . In that case the supply available for the market is reduced . And the supply offered by such a dairy farmer is thus reduced even though the price may not be below his cost of production , even though , in other words , the low price is nevertheless high enough to make dairying as profitable to him as any other line he might undertake . On the supply side , as on the demand side , it is worth while emphasizing the distinction between goods producible in indefinite amounts , in relation to the world 's need of them , such as wheat , corn , cotton , iron ore ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as original Greek statuary , the paintings of Michael Angelo , and , chief in importance , land . It is true that producers of wheat , corn and cotton will not engage in the production of these crops at a price below cost ( in the sense and on the hypotheses herein set forth ) . But the sellers of land space do not have cost of production to consider , because land space practically speaking ( though there is some " made land " ) can not be produced . The owners of land space therefore , in selling it , consider only the utility to them of what they can get for it compared to the utility to them of the land . The producer of cotton , also , after he has produced it , considers only the utility of what he can get for it compared to the utility to him of the cotton ? if he has , himself , any use for it . But cotton is constantly being used up and requiring to be re-supplied and before producing it , the  | cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor will he go on , year after year , raising cotton for less than this . Having made the foregoing general analysis of cost of production and its influence on demand and supply , we have now to enter into some of the more detailed aspects of cost . A larger supply of any good ( assuming no improvements in methods of production ) involves either more labor by those already engaged in producing it or a larger number of such producers . Neither can ordinarily be had without higher price as an inducement . Let us first consider the possibilities as regards getting more goods of a given sort by engaging more persons for their production . In much of our previous discussion , we have seemed to assume that the tendency , so far as change of employment is easy , is for returns to workers to be about the same in one line of activity as in another , in proportion to effort and other sacrifices . But we have not emphasized the fact that a given line of activity may seem much harder , much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This fact may sometimes have an important influence on price . By way of illustration , let us suppose a change in occupations abroad of such a sort that far more American wheat was wanted than before and this not temporarily owing to war conditions but more or less constantly . For a while this want might be very inadequately satisfied , but should the demand and the resultant high price continue , larger acreage in the United States would be sown to wheat , and a larger proportion of the American population would devote themselves to wheat production . Of those who changed from other lines into agriculture , some would he persons with no training for the work and others person% with comparatively little taste for it . To make the large production continuous , the price of wheat must remain  | high enough to keep these persons in the work . After a period of a generation or two , new tastes and habits would have time to form , and a larger number of men than before might be willing to engage permanently in agriculture without much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a period of some years , a considerable inducement to wheat production , in the form of high prices , might be necessary . There is , however , in addition , the possibility of securing more goods of a given sort , e.g. , wheat , by getting those already engaged in its production to work more intensively or to work longer hours . But additional hours of labor become progressively more and more a burden and there is a progressive disinclination to perform such labor . At first thought we might suppose that a higher rate of pay per hour would encourage working longer hours , that a higher price of wheat , for instance , would cause persons already engaged in wheat production to work longer hours and thus produce more wheat . But it is perhaps equally likely that the larger returns per hour , resulting in greater prosperity , would make the longer hours of labor seem less necessary as a means of getting a living " and would encourage the taking of more leisure . So there is no certainty that a higher price would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So far as agriculturists could change from other lines to the production of wheat , a rise in wheat prices might induce them to do so , and eventually it would bring more men into agriculture ; but it very likely would not increase the intensity or the hours of labor and it might , conceivably , even decrease them . It does not follow that a lower price would cause more wheat to be produced than a higher . For though smaller returns from wheat and other farm products might necessitate somewhat more work to make a living , if agriculturists had no alternative , yet , as things are , lower returns than in other lines would divert many into these other lines and so  | almost of necessity decrease the supply of agricultural produce , just as higher returns would draw more men into wheat raising and increase the number of bushels produced . Land and Capital Costs in Production We have seen that to get a larger supply of any good may be expected , ordinarily , to require a larger amount of labor . Attention should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of more land or a more intensive application of labor and capital to land already used for the line of production in question , or both . Suppose , as before , that there is desired the production of wheat . Assuming other things to be equal , more wheat can not be produced unless the land already devoted to wheat production is cultivated more intensively , unless additional land not previously cultivated is brought under cultivation , or unless land previously used for other purposes is diverted to the production of wheat . To get larger wheat production in any of these ways , requires a higher price . Assume that the price has been $1 a bushel . At that price the average producer will cultivate his land with whatever degree of intensiveness yields the greatest gain . He will  | increase the amount of labor devoted to cultivating his wheat land , as long as the wheat yielded pays the wages of this labor and a satisfactory return on the necessary capital . But the point is soon reached beyond which additional labor can not , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the requisite wages . For it is im-possible , on a given piece of land , indefinitely to increase the amount of labor and get a proportionately increased product . This fact is , of course , generally known to farmers , and , in its applications to urban land , is known to merchants and manufacturers also . But if wheat sells for $1.20 a bushel , and money wages remain the same , or even advance somewhat , it may be profitable to cultivate a given piece of land more intensively than otherwise would pay . An additional man may be hired and , though the amount of wheat produced probably will not increase in anything like the same per cent as the labor , the increase , at the new and higher price , will be more likely to cover the additional wages paid and to yield some return to capital , than it would at the lower price . But the point to be emphasized is that , other things equal , it will not pay thus to cultivate the land more intensively unless the price to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary means of bringing out the larger supply . The same principle applies to urban land . To increase the amount of manufacturing or of retail trading on a given area , necessitates more crowded quarters or else higher buildings , and the higher buildings are made the more solid must be their foundations . In other words , a point is eventually reached where an additional story , and , therefore , additional production on the same land space , yields a less reward than would smaller production , proportionate to the labor ( including the labor of building , elevator service , etc. ) expended .  | If all land had exactly the same capacities and advantages , an additional demand for wheat would not for any great length of time cause wheat land to be cultivated any more intensively than before , as compared with land used for other purposes . It would always be more profitable , if a larger amount of wheat were wanted , to divert land from the production of other goods into the production of wheat . But in fact , land has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some loss in turning into wheat production land previously used to produce ( say ) corn . The corn land is farther south , on an average ; and rather than get all the extra wheat desired , by diverting former corn land into wheat production , it may be desirable to get part of it by cultivating more intensively the land already devoted to wheat raising . But it is also true that an additional demand for wheat ( or other goods ) is likely to be partly satisfied by diverting into such production land which was previously otherwise used . This , of course , necessitates a higher price for the wheat . Let us suppose that tastes or customs have changed so that wheat is even more used as food than now and corn less so . Since some of the land used to produce corn can also be used to produce wheat , the probability is that part of the additional wheat wanted will be so secured . But it will not be so secured except at a higher relative price for wheat . Presumably the lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at existing values , it pays best so to devote them . But with wheat higher in price , and corn , perhaps , lower , it may be worth while to divert some land from the one use to the other . The use which was before less profitable , now becomes more profitable in relation to other uses . The two kinds of goods are competitive and that one which can pay more for the use of the land , gets it . A change in relative values  | may give to a wheat crop , land which would otherwise have been devoted to corn ; or may , in a city , give to a shirt factory , land which would otherwise be used for a shoe factory or for a wholesale grocery . Following our previously adopted sense of " cost of production , " we may say that the cost of production of wheat ( at the margin of wheat production , viz. , on the land which it is just worth while to devote to that purpose instead of to some other ? or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just induced to follow wheat production ) is measured by the value of other goods , e.g. , corn , which the same labor and land might have produced instead . Since , besides land and labor , machinery and other kinds of capital are used in production , and since such capital can be accumulated only by saving , we may regard saving ( or " waiting " ) as one of the three primary factors of production , the other two being labor and land . And we may widen our concept of cost of production so as to include consideration of saving . We shall then say that the cost of production of wheat , for example , is the amount of corn or other goods which the same labor , land and saving could produce if devoted to such other line and which must therefore be sacrificed if the wheat is produced instead . From the foregoing discussion it should be clear why a tax on the producer of a specific commodity in proportion to output , causes a rise in the price of the commodity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to pay a tax of fifty cents on each bushel produced , many of these producers would find themselves receiving smaller incomes than if their labor , land and capital were used in some other line or lines , e.g. , for the production of oats , potatoes , corn , beef or other product . In order to keep in the business of raising wheat , enough labor , land and capital to meet the demands of consumers ( even though with a higher price the demand would be less than before ) , the price  | of the wheat would have to be higher than if the tax were not levied . And similarly as regards a tax on the producers of cotton cloth , shoes , coal or other goods . The value of land ? and of some other goods not now reproducible , such as original Greek statuary ? has little or no relation to cost of production . Land has no cost of production ( though there is , of course , a very little " made land " ) in the sense in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchasers will pay for land is not , practically , limited by any alternative they may have of producing some of it themselves , nor is the amount that sellers will take at all determined by any corresponding consideration of other rewards which the labor of its production might have brought them , since there is , for land as such , no such labor of production . Land has a value based on its earning power , but this value is neither directly nor ultimately fixed by any cost of production . Two cases of value , sometimes called special cases though really , perhaps , more usual than the more simple case , remain to be cleared up . One is the case of joint demand ; the other is the case of joint supply . Demand for the services of railroads may be mentioned as a case of joint demand . Demand for rail transportation involves , indirectly , demand for rails , ties , ballast , engines , cars , services of engineers , etc . All of these together are necessary for transportation . Demand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) fix a set of rates ( prices ) for transportation and these rates go out indirectly as payments for the various services by which the service  | of transportation is made possible . If any one thing needful for transportation is scarce , e.g. , ties , the price of that thing may go very high indeed without raising the price of transportation ( dependent on so many prices ) in anything like the same degree , and therefore without greatly diminishing the demand for transportation . The different articles and services included in joint demand may change greatly in price relatively to each other , according to their relative costs of production , without changing the price of or the demand for the desired combined service . Joint supply is the familiar case of by-products . Two or more things are in part produced by the same process . Thus , coke and coal gas are both produced by the process of abstracting gas from coal . The expense of mining the coal and the expense of abstracting the gas are then joint expenses . These expenses would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure the coke . Another example , commonly given , is that of beef and hides . These are joint products of the cattle raising industry . The expense of cattle raising is a joint expense , an expense which must be met to secure either the beef or the hides , but which , if it is met , makes it possible without great additional cost , to get both beef and hides . In this case , as in most cases of joint supply or joint cost , not all of the cost is joint . The cost of tanning hides is not joint but is necessary only to get the hides in marketable form . The expenses of marketing are also , for the most part , special . But a considerable part of the total expense is joint . In the case of joint supply , a part of the expense of production , i.e. , the part which is joint , will be covered in varying proportions in the prices of the several goods so produced , according to the relative demand for such goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive ,  | from all the goods jointly produced , the average return on the labor and capital applied to production of such goods . But any one of the by-products may , if demand for it is small , sell for little more than enough to cover the special expense of producing and marketing it . Thus , in the case of beef and hides , the prices received for both must cover the cost of slaughtering , marketing , and tanning , as well as the cost of maintaining the herds ; but the price received for the hides alone , in case the demand for hides is relatively small ? or for the beef alone , if the demand for it is small ? need cover little more than the special cost of producing and marketing the one product , leaving the purchasers of the other to pay the part of the cost which is joint . In consequence of this fact , an increased demand for beef would tend to lower the price of hides . For it would encourage cattle raising and would thus increase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be sold ( for we are not assuming a greater demand for them ) except at a lower price . Hence , the price would fall , and , since the process of producing the beef involves , also , the preliminary step of producing the hides , it would be worth while to sell the hides for the cost of tanning and marketing , rather than not sell them at all . In this chapter we have endeavored to trace the influences bearing upon value and price back to their more remote origins . Since supply of one good means demand for others , it appeared that there could not be a general oversupply of all goods but that an oversupply of some means merely a relative undersupply of others . Demand for any good involves a willingness to sacrifice something in order to gel it . The sacrifice may take the form of extra effort or of  | giving up some alternative good . At any price the demand of each purchaser is for so much of the good that another unit of it would be worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , in labor or in other goods . A high price of any article would tend to reduce demand for it not only by discouraging its consumption but also by causing some who would else be purchasers of it to become instead producers of it . In this sense , demand for any good depends upon its cost of production . Purchasers will not , in the long run , pay more for a good than the amount of other goods which the same productive effort and other sacrifice will produce . The prices at which there may be demand for a non-reproducible good , are not thus limited . The supply of any good depends upon the price offered , and upon the intensity of demand of the producers of it for the other goods they indirectly get through its sale . A higher price will not of necessity always cause producers to work longer or harder at their task . It may encourage them to reduce their hours of work since it may enable them to earn more than before in fewer hours than before . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good produced since it will usually increase the number of persons producing that good by diverting some from other lines . Supply , therefore , depends upon contemporary cost of production except , of course , in the case of nonreproducible goods , of which , with some qualification , land space is an example . To get more of anything produced may require a higher price because persons relatively ill adapted to its production or to whom the work is comparatively distasteful must be drawn in , because poorer land must be used , because land already so used must be used more intensively , and because land relatively better fitted ( at the old relation of prices ) for other production must be drawn in . The cost of production of any good comes finally to be expressible as the amount of some other good or goods which the same labor , land and saving could produce . Perhaps it would be more accurate to say it is expressible  | as the value of these other goods or , better still , the interest , wages and rent which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other line or lines . We shall be expressing the matter still more accurately if we say that , to keep workers ( and land and capital ) in any industry , it is necessary that the price of the goods they produce yield them what they confidently believe they could secure in some other line or lines . Of course such a belief is directly influenced by observation of the incomes people in other lines are currently receiving . Obviously , cost of production , as the expression is here used , has no relation to the use of the expression by political spokesmen for a particular economic group , who heatedly declare that those they speak for do not receive a price high enough to cover " cost of production " and must be given special favors , at the expense of others , to make good the alleged deficiency . In our use of the expression , a person who is doing as well in his line of work or industry as he could do in any other line , is receiving his cost of production , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may feel that his more prosperous ? or , as indicated by demands for higher prices for food , to aid farmers , often , in part , his less prosperous ? fellow citizens should grant him a subsidy . In each line of industry there is not just one cost of production . There are many costs of production . And so , if more labor , capital and land must be drawn into the industry , the price of its output to the public must ordinarily cover higher costs than if less of the output is wanted . The cases of joint demand and joint supply were found to involve some intricacies but no new fundamental principle .  | At this point we may well reemphasize what was stated in concluding the previous chapter , that our economic system is one which adjusts production to consumption through the lure of price and not through governmental compulsion . To secure productive activity of the kinds desired by consumers and buyers generally , we rely upon the wish of each individual to make as large an income as possible as easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the undertaking and carrying on of economic processes is a desire for reward rather than a fear of punishment . But in order that the price system shall work at all acceptably it is necessary not only that desirable productive activity be fostered but also that definitely anti-social activity be held in check . How greatly would even our narrowly economic efforts and aims be thwarted if cheating , robbery , and murder were indulged in by the majority ! At best we fall sufficiently short of perfection in preventing socially harmful and disruptive acts . Too often such acts turn out to be individually profitable . Nevertheless , whatever order and effectiveness our economic system has are dependent upon the restraints imposed by law , public opinion , conscience and sympathy . It is not for us , in this brief comment on the legal and ethical background of our economic order , to express with undue confidence any opinion on the problem of origins . For how long a time has natural selection been at work on man and his precursors , developing a type of mind sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had least ability to cooperate and greatest tendency to rob and hurt each other ? How largely are the promptings of conscience and the sense of sympathy a result of family life , of the training by parents , of the influence exerted by the school , the playground and other character-forming institutions ? At any rate , there has come to be , with many persons , a definite sentiment against wrong-doing ; and perhaps only a few are ready to follow exclusively the promptings of a narrow  | self interest , utterly regardless of the injury they may inflict on others . Almost all are influenced in some degree by sympathy with their fellows and by acknowledged principles of right and justice . They can not be wholly happy , whatever their own material gains , if they are clearly aware that these gains are secured through positive injury to others ; though too many persons easily and fallaciously persuade themselves that what is profitable for them is advantageous for the public . Yet enough are definitely recalcitrant . And however abnormal according to ordinary human standards may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? restraint upon his actions from sympathy or from conscience , who really places the satisfaction of purely selfish personal desires above all requirements of human cooperation and all standards of community life , there seems to be no philosophical ground upon which to base an appeal to him . To appeal to the requirements of community life , in arguing with a person who cares not what happens to others than himself , or to appeal to the sentiment of sympathy of a person who acknowledges and knows no such sentiment , is as foolish as to ask a blind man to judge between a masterpiece of art and a daub . Standards of community living must exist if communities are to exist , if organized society is to exist . Various forces may operate to bring different persons into some degree of conformity with such standards . In any case , a community or organized society can not permit all standards to be completely flouted by any of its members . And so , when all other motives and arguments fail , appeal must be made to such deterrents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not forget , then , in all our discussions regarding the motives of economic behavior and the consequences to prices , to interest rates , to wages and to rent , of the various influences at work , that these influences are at work in economic society , i.e. , among human beings who live gregarious lives . Let us not forget that the existence of community life and the standards of action which make  | eimnmunity life possible are the background against which our picture of each specific economic influence , law or consequence must be viewed . Our average standards of fairness and right in social life are not as high as might be desired . If they were , and if our comprehension of cause and effect in things economic were correspondingly acute , we would already have realized the economic reforms which have been and are to be discussed in this book . But we are far better off than if we had no standards at all . Although we have been , throughout this chapter , explaining the relation of alternative uses of capital , labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what conditions fix the return to owners of capital , the return to labor and the return on land . These are problems which will engage our attention in the chapters ahead . And out of our study of them may come further light on the fairness of our economic system , on its shortcomings as a means of promoting the common welfare and on how it can be made to contribute to this welfare more effectively and equitably in the future than it has done in the past .  | The factors of production may be said to be land , labor and capital . ' Some writers mention business leadership as a fourth factor , but this , since it involves mental effort and requires directing ability , may properly enough be regarded as a kind of labor . Other writers class land with capital , but we have already found reasons to consider land separately from goods produced by mankind , ' and shall have reason further to press the distinction , later on . Let us now consider what fixes the amount of each factor of production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its amount is practically fixed by nature . There is , to be sure , some " made land . " The people of Holland have dyked back the North Sea and made cultivable a considerable area which would otherwise be largely under water . There are doubtless other cases where land is " made " by human effort , though not on so large a scale . But it is nevertheless almost absolutely true that the amount of land space in existence is fixed by nature and can not , practically , be changed by man . The barrier to increase of available land space is not absolute . It is conceivable , for example , that  | shallow parts of the ocean might be filled in by dredging sediment from other shallow parts . But the expense would almost invariably be prohibitive , certainly in relation to the expected gain . In other words the ( marginal ) cost of production of land , if it were necessary to produce much of it in the way suggested , would be tremendously high , and land would have to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth while so to produce it to any appreciable extent . The value of land space , therefore , as pointed out in the last chapter , ' can not be said to depend in any marked degree , if at all , on the cost of production of land . Nor can the amount of land space in existence be said to depend on the amount for which land will sell or upon the gains which land ownership yields . Thus land space differs from most other goods in the relative fixity of its amount , for a higher value of other goods or a higher income from their use , or a greater efficiency of labor , may affect the amount or volume of such goods considerably . Though land fertility may be increased by labor , land space practically can not be . So far as the fertility of land is given by nature and is not , practically speaking , dependent on the efforts of man for its maintenance , we shall class it with land space as a part of the factor land . So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as capital . The situation advantages of land are , in large degree , socially produced but are hardly at all individually produced . A contractor , with the aid of labor , equipment and materials , can produce a factory . He can not produce a valuable city site . The factory would be capital . The site is land . Land may be regarded , in a sense , as one of the tools man has to work with , a tool furnished by nature . Man 's other  | tools , though drawn from the land , are furnished , in a sense , by himself . He constructs them and fits them to suit his needs . With these tools we should include such improvements on the land as foresting , draining , fertilizing , fencing , clearing , leveling , etc. , as well as the buildings placed upon the land . All of these things can be increased by human effort and are not fixed in quantity in the same degree as land . Among the things produced by men , it is necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption and those made as steps towards future consumption , such as accumulated stocks of goods , buildings , tools and machinery , etc . The former we call consumption goods , and the latter we call capital . While it may be hard to determine , in some borderline cases , to which class certain things belong , the general distinction is sufficiently clear for use in our further discussions . What determines the extent to which such capital will be accumulated ? Several influences are important . First , may be mentioned the efficiency of production . In a community where wealth is easily produced , a large amount can be accumulated with less deprivation of immediate wants than if productive effort were less efficient . Rich natural resoures , well-trained and intelligent labor , high capacity for work , all tend to facilitate accumulation . The fact that accumulation has taken place and that , consequently , the community has more and better machinery of production , tends to make productive effort more effective and so to make further accumulation easier . In the second place , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a community , upon the extent to which they desire to save and are willing or anxious to deny themselves present gratifications for the sake of the future of themselves or their children , other dependents .  | We are now ready to begin our discussion of the sharing among different economic classes , of what the industrial and commercial processes produce for human use and consumption . First among the shares received , we may consider the interest on accumulated capital . This has been said by some writers to be due to the productiveness or productivity of capital , and by others to be a consequence of the fact that to get an accumulation of capital there must be a degree of abstinence practiced or that an inducement must he offered to get men to sacrifice present consumption for future . Let us examine these alleged causes of interest with a view to determining what their significance may be for our problem . That capital is productive in the sense that we can get more with it than without it , is generally recognized . It is recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not by virtue of a priori reasonings . And experience indicates it to be a fact , not in the sense that every possible mode of production with capital is more effective than production without it , but only in the sense that , given any stage of knowledge of how to use capital , production is more efficient if we can get a certain amount of capital to use in the understood ways than if we can not . No one would seriously contend that every use of machinery or other capital is advantageous . It is entirely probable that we often use valuable ( in the sense of having high cost ) and complicated machinery to do work that would be as effectively done without it or to do work not worth doing . We construct buildings of stone in places which are soon deserted and where , therefore , frame buildings ? though less enduring ? would be more economical . And where we do use capital advantageously , it often is true that an attempt to use it on a much greater scale  | would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more steps is not desirable without limit . The thought will perhaps occur to the reader , not only that capitalistic or " roundabout " production processes either may or may not be advantageous , but also that if those which we use are , for the most part , advantageous , this is because we would not intentionally use them if they were not . On the hypothesis that present pleasures are always preferred to future ones and future discomforts to present ones , this view is justified . But it might easily be the case that a person or group of persons would rather do work today which should find its fruition years hence when needs are great and strength is small than to do the work now for a like present reward , or later for a later reward . We can not definitely assert , therefore , that a long-time process of production , involving the making of machinery or the planting of trees or some other early labor as an intermediate step to getting a future product , would never be chosen in preference to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from the point of view of a larger total product . Often we might find advantage enough from saving , in having nature offer us the opportunity to store up labor ? which it happens to be convenient for us to undergo today ? until a future when its product is more needed . Nevertheless , although some kinds of capitalistic production may not profit us , and although we might be willing to produce capitalistically to some extent without getting a consequent larger return ; yet that we usually do , in practice ,  | secure a much larger product with the use of capital than we could secure without it , is a conclusion resting on hardly-to-bedenied experience . And so long as we can find ways of thus producing capitalistically which are gainful , i.e. , which yield us more than the same effort would yield if a part of the effort applied were not first devoted to capital formation , we are not likely to waste our time in the many ( perhaps ) possible ways of capitalistic production which do not yield a gain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective , the qualification should be made that this principle applies as logically to the production of noxious drugs , burglar 's tools and other socially undesirable articles or services , as to the production of socially desirable goods . Capital becomes altogether beneficent only if all possible anti-social uses of it are prohibited . Again , roundabout or capitalistic production must be held to include activities other than the construction of what is ordinarily called material equipment . It includes activities which work out their long run effects through changes wrought in men 's minds . Thus , it may be regarded as including education pursued for the purpose of increasing one 's earning power . It includes also such activities as the bribery of public officials and the attempt , by misleading public sentiment and by building up political machines , to get thereby , for those pursuing such policies , profitable contracts and other advantages in the future , at public expense . A business concern which , by thus taking measures and making expenditures to secure for itself the opportunity of getting profitable if dishonorable business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased its capital as much as if it had increased its investment in buildings or machinery and is , from its point of view , engaged in roundabout or capitalistic production . It is to be emphasized that capitalistic production is  | time-using production . Instead of plucking , as we need it , the wild grain , and so keeping an interval of but minutes or even seconds between effort and the satisfaction of needs , we sow or plant the grain months before we expect to reap it ; we build barns which ? though we may soon begin to use them ? we shall not have finished using , perhaps , at the end of half a century ; we manufacture plows , harrows and reapers which will not yield us , for many years , all that it is in them eventually to yield ; we construct factories for the manufacture of these implements , factories which , when their builders have long since ceased to build , will still be turning out implements of agriculture for long continued future use ; we build bridges , lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of which can not , ordinarily , yield us this year or next an advantage at all comparable to their cost ? i.e. , to the advantage which our effort might have brought if devoted to the satisfaction of more immediate needs ? but which , in the long run , pay for themselves often several times over . In all of these cases we interpolate a long period of time between the putting forth of effort and the receiving of its entire product , though in some of the cases a small part of the resulting product is enjoyed early . Production may be made more capitalistic by increasing the length of time of waiting between effort and enjoyment of the results of effort , or by increasing the proportionate amount of effort ( more accurately , perhaps , by increasing the proportionate amount of labor , of land , and of available tools ) which is directed to remote instead of comparatively immediate ends . In either case there would be an increase in the average time , all work considered , between the putting forth of effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time elapsing between effort and the receiving of the entire reward of the effort is increased when , instead of making frame buildings for factories , we construct the factories of structural steel . The buildings are more permanent ; a longer time elapses before they have rendered all the service of which they are capable . But we also increase the roundaboutness of production if , without lengthening the production period for any one factory , we divert a part of our labor force , previously occupied in utilizing existing equipment , into the work of building an additional factory . It may easily be that all of the labor employed in ( say ) shoe production could he employed in keeping up and in operating the existing factories and machinery ; and that nevertheless production will be larger if some of this labor is used for the building of another factory , since thus there will be more space and larger equipment per operator . Such diverting of a part of shoe-producing effort to the addition of shoe-producing equipment would be , no less than to make equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , also , the diverting of coal mines which had been used for the production of coal to run the machinery of an existing shoe factory , into the production of coal for the smelting of iron and for the making of structural steel to be used in building an additional shoe factory , would mean a use of the coal mines , as well as of the labor of the operators , in a more roundabout way than before . Again , the diverting of land from use as pasture and for the production of hides to be used in shoe making , into forest growing and the production of lumber for the building of shoe factories would be , in respect to such land , an extension of the roundaboutness of production . Such a change to greater roundaboutness in the production on exceptionally well located ( or otherwise good ) land would be likely to mean a larger change in the degree of roundaboutness of production than a corresponding shift in the kind of  | production to which inferior land is put . Still again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and capital ( the building ) is made more roundabout if a factory intended for the manufacturing of shoes is used for the making of shoe manufacturing machinery . Any parts of the product which may be attributable to the land or to the capital as well as what is attributable directly to labor , then take more largely the form of capital or instruments of further production than before and less largely the form of consumption goods . There seems , however , little point to speaking of capital ( i.e. , produced equipment goods ) as being diverted to greater or less roundaboutness in production since capital is itself but a stage in the roundabout application of labor applied to natural resources . Capital is an intermediate good and a derivative of more ultimate factors . To divert capital to more roundabout production is really to bring it about that the original labor of constructing this capital was more largely roundabout than it otherwise would have been and that the land space utilized in the process of its production was also devoted to the securing of more remote ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of production is increased when labor is diverted from less to more roundabout processes and that this change is greater when the labor is working on sites which yield a surplus or rent above wages , since this surplus then , as well as the ( marginal ) product of labor , takes the form of production goods . The roundaboutness of production has been increased , to use another illustration , by the building of railroads . Let us suppose two towns , A and B , 200 miles apart . In the absence of better means of transport , goods are carried from the one town to the other and different goods returned in trade , by men acting as carriers . It takes , let us say , a week , for twenty men to carry a ton of goods from A to B. Omitting , for the present , considerations  | regarding the raising or manufacture of these goods , we may say that only a week of labor precedes the consumption of the goods and only two weeks precede a complete trade and the consequent consumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the benefits towards which the two weeks of labor were directed follow with relative quickness the putting forth of the effort . If , however , instead of carrying the goods on their backs , the carriers make carts or wagons and domesticate animals to draw these , their accomplishments may be much greater ; but the period during which these accomplishments are realized will be , in relation to the period of effort , more deferred than before . A wagon may , indeed , be made in a week 's time and by the end of another week it may have carried more goods between the two towns than the maker could carry , without it , in a month or more . But the wagon will not , in a week , be worn out . On the contrary , it will presumably be in condition for use during many later weeks through all of which the service rendered by it is largely a result of the labor put forth in making it . The rewards of that labor ( of making the wagon ) are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rewards of the labor of carrying when wagons were not used . Suppose , next , that a railway is built between the towns . The building requires three years , during most of which period the rails can not be used to carry goods . At the end of the three years , the possible trade may be , indeed , much greater than before and the carriage of goods swifter ; but the labor of building the railroad will still be contributing to community welfare long after those who built the road have ceased to be able to lift a spade or carry a tie . Surely the length of time elapsing between effort and the totality of the reward of that effort , or even the earlier half of the reward of that effort , has been tremendously increased . By no means all improvements in the processes of production are of the time-lengthening character . But it does appear to be true that many of them are so . Our orchards , our irrigated farms , our hard-surfaced roads and concrete  | sidewalks , our buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and iron , our railroads , and our great steel ocean-going vessels , ? all involved for their construction labor the fruits of which are not enjoyed in full until long years beyond the time when the labor was put forth . But although the more roundabout processes of production seem to be ? at least , those that we actually do follow  - -  clearly advantageous to us , yet our gain seems to be proportionately smaller as we thus utilize proportionately larger amounts of labor . To add to the community 's equipment a certain number of railroads , buildings , machines , fruit orchards , etc. , may add immensely to the product we can hope to realize from our efforts , while a further amount of labor devoted to the still greater increase of such equipment would be of diminishing advantage , and a still further devoting of time to such a purpose of yet smaller benefit . A single railroad between New York and Chicago is tremendously advantageous as compared with none at all . A second railroad may be of great importance but is less nearly indispensable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be worth building . But there comes a margin of relative sufficiency of such railroads , beyond which it pays better to devote our labor to other purposes . Again , while it may be far better to have one or more railroads between two points than not to have them , there will be , perhaps , a less proportionate gain from the added expenditure necessary to make the lines relatively straight . It is much better to have a winding road than no road at all . A straight and level road might involve tunneling through mountains and the bridging of gulleys and might be , therefore , immensely more expensive in initial cost ; while yet it might , eventually , be labor saving .  | I n other words , a given large amount of effort is likely eventually to accomplish more if the straight road is built . But the per cent gain may diminish with each such improvement . From the last one it is a marginal gain . The addition of stock , buildings and machinery to a farm reaches , in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go . A barn may seem almost indispensable . That more time should be devoted to its building , making it larger , or that two barns should be built , may be desirable for the sake of having a protected space for the bumper crops of exceptional years ; but a second barn is of much less importance than a first and may be said to bring a diminishing advantage . Even the fact that part of such a crop must be stacked may not be a sufficient reason for the building of the larger or the second barn , in view of alternative opportunities for the employment of the necessary labor . Likewise , a mowing machine , though requiring more initial labor to make and , therefore , a much higher price to buy , is immensely to be preferred to several scythes . A second mowing machine is of less advantage , though the gain from having it also may be considerable . Sometimes the possession of the second machine may make possible the getting in of a crop during a short sunny period , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few days , be otherwise used to advantage ; or the second machine may temporarily be the sole resource if the first happens to be , for any reason , out of commission . The gain from a third machine would be negligible and from a fourth there would perhaps be no gain at all . Again , to take another illustration from agriculture , the grain product which a given amount of labor can secure , will be greater if cradles are used for reaping than if sickles are used , and very much greater if a reaping machine is used . Or we may say that a given grain product can be realized from a given land area with a smaller expenditure of labor when the improved machinery is used than when reaping is done with the tools of an earlier generation . And still further gain , though perhaps less gain proportionally , is  | realized , where large areas of level land make such machinery feasible , from the use of modern harvesters which cut and thresh the grain in a single operation . Nevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , as to both quantity and quality of machinery , beyond which it is not worth while to pass . But if , in any community , only a limited amount of effort ( as well as of land and equipment already available ) can he devoted to the construction of equipment for production , consideration must be given to the fact that some equipment is more important than other . The farmer can get along without a reaper better than without a barn . He can get along without a silo better than without a reaper . The railroad can get along without stations or with inadequate stations better than it can get along without a track , engines and cars . The city can get along without concrete paving on its streets better than it can get along without any streets at all . We conclude , then , that the gains from roundabout production tend to diminish as such production is extended , and tend to diminish whether the extension of roundaboutness takes the form of the addition of equipment beyond the most necessary kinds , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of more expensive quality of equipment . In fact , when the amount of effort , land and  | tools available for the production or maintenance of desirable capital equipment is greatly limited , the effect is likely to be as apparent in the making of poorer and cheaper equipment as in a diminution in the number of equipment implements . The reason is that the competition of employers for the use of equipment will result in relatively poor equipment for the use of nearly all labor rather than in splendid equipment for some labor and none at all for the rest . A small amount of the poor equipment yields greater advantages to those enterprisers who would otherwise have none ? and they can therefore bid higher for it ? than a corresponding addition to the quality of their equipment would yield to employers who might be especially favored with the more costly buildings , machinery , etc. , but who could not , because of the limited amount of this capital , employ all the community 's available labor . In other words , although the more costly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet if the necessary labor of its construction would be so great as to mean an inadequate number of implements for the labor force of the community , the bidding for the use of capital of those who might otherwise have none , would prevent putting all available capital value into the more durable or otherwise more expensive forms . Let us suppose a community for the use of which an amount of capital is available large enough to house all its industries in frame buildings but sufficient to house only half of them in buildings of structural steel and concrete . Though the more substantial buildings would perhaps have a potential life more than twice as long , yet , in view of the assumed existing situation , it would not be desirable to choose them . The extra investment of labor that would have to be made to construct a given building in the more substantial way , could be used to get a second of the less substantial buildings along with the first ; and  | this would be the more worth while investment , until the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construct a relative sufficiency of the more expensive buildings . An additional cheap building would add much more to the efficiency of labor in such a community than greater durability of a building certain to be constructed in any case . Hence an employer of labor would prefer to use what capital he could get , in the former way . Hence , also , prospective borrowers of capital desiring to use it in the former way could afford to pay more for its use . It is not true , therefore , as some critics of our industrial system appear to think , that the direction of industry is solely or almost solely a matter for engineers and technicians who can alone determine what is necessary and desirable in the construction and operation of industrial plants . The technically perfect plant may be economically unwise because it would earn less than the annual interest which lenders would charge on the sum required to construct it and which their savings would be worth to society in some other line . The engineer may decide what is technically feasible . The enterpriser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economically desirable to use in proportion to a given amount of labor as well as what goods the public is likely to want . It should be emphasized that the use of capital does not necessarily mean a progressively larger product , does not mean , for instance , a larger product next year than this . All it means is a larger product next year than next year 's product would be if capital were not used . We may choose to produce capitalistically up to and not beyond a certain limit . If we so choose , we may go on , year after year , producing the same amount of wealth and maintaining an unchanging standard of living , but getting , each year , more than we could get with corresponding effort , were our methods of production less capitalistic.  | Saving or Abstinence in Relation to Interest In order that the more productive roundabout process may be followed , there must be saving . For the roundabout process means , as we have seen , productive effort the full reward of which is greatly deferred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed before the resultant services can begin , and not for many years are these efforts rewarded with all the services towards which they were directed . Yet the persons who build the railroad must have food and clothing while they are at work . In like manner , the labor of building a factory for the making of agricultural machinery may be an initial step in the securing of wheat and , therefore , in the securing of bread . The persons who perform this labor must have food and presumably bread , yet the labor does not immediately produce bread . There must be bread at hand , or securable by the builders during the period of their building , else the work can not go on . The fact that subsistence must be available to make possible the prosecution of roundabout production may mean and probably does mean that there are at hand accumulations from the past . These accumulations will not he mainly , perhaps , stores of wheat , etc. , from the last harvest ( although in winter and spring such stores must he considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and buildings which facilitate production of wheat , etc. , as needed . But whether roundabout production necessitates past saving or not , it certainly necessitates saving . The saving may be present saving of other members or classes of the community . Thus , the building of a factory for the manufacture of farm implements may be possible because the producers of wheat raise more wheat than they can use , save a part of the money derived from the sale , and invest this money in a company organized to manufacture agricultural machinery . p 300 It will be advantageous to trace out in greater detail the interrelations of savers ( who may or may not be laborers ) and the laborers employed by the savings . The wheat raisers ( assuming them to do the saving ) produce wheat in excess of their own needs ; they sell this excess on the market and it becomes a part of the stock of usable wealth of the community . The money they receive may be regarded as so many tickets entitling them to draw from this stock a value equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not spend all of this money in withdrawing consumption goods . A part of the money is saved . The saved money is invested in the stock or bonds of the agricultural machinery company ( either directly or through the intermediation of , perhaps , an investment bank ) . The company then uses this money to hire labor to build its factory . The laborers employed to build , in spending their money for bread and other necessary or desired goods , are taking from society 's stock and using up , the goods which the saved money represented . While doing this , however , they have produced a factory . Therefore the persons who did the saving and investing now have ownership in the factory instead of having had and enjoyed the other wealth which they might by now have consumed , had they chosen the alternative of not saving . Part of all saving done is obviously from individual choice . Part of it is the result of the action of corporation  | directors ( chosen , however , by the stockholders ) who decide not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respective companies might justify , but instead to re-invest some of these earnings in further capital construction . Even in this latter case , however , the individual who objects has at least the option of selling his shares of stock , or a fraction of them , to others and of spending the proceeds in current enjoyment . The same principle applies if , instead of adding new capital , the savers merely keep up the old capital . Thus , the owner of a shoe factory is supposed to get from it , during its life , besides interest on its value , enough to replace it when it is too old for further use . But this involves saving of a replacement fund instead of spending for current enjoyment the entire receipts from the factory . In like manner the machines used are supposed to yield , on an average , enough to replace their value when they are worn out or when improvements necessitate scrapping them . A part of the shoes produced may be assumed to be used , directly or through their equivalents in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine replacement . The situation is not essentially dissimilar when the owner of the machines decides to shift his investment . He then does not replace these machines but uses their earnings in a corresponding way to provide for the construction of machines of a different kind or of some other form of capital , having uses of another sort . Past accumulations , then , with the exception of stocks of consumable goods which , because of the requirements of convenience or because of the seasonal character of their production , must be kept on hand , take largely such forms as buildings , roads and streets , railroads , bridges and ships , and machinery . ( They also take , in part , the form of political connections and other means of exploitation . ) The labor which is engaged in maintaining or in adding to any of this equipment is supported the more adequately because the accumulations of capital already made render  | industry more effective . Nevertheless , the support of this labor comes immediately , in large part , from current product . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing equipment means that a part of economic society is devoting a part of its purchasing power to such ends instead of consuming as much as its possession ? or receipt ? of purchasing power would enable it to consume . The discussion of saving and investing has thus far seemed to establish the conclusion that savings take form as equipment goods by being turned over to laborers who , while consuming goods of the value of the sums saved , are at the same time producing equipment . But the amounts saved and thus devoted to the production of production goods , are not paid over solely to laborers as wages . They are also paid over , in part , to landowners as rent for the use of land applied to the production of capital , and to the owners of capital now in existence , as interest , in payment for the use of this capital in the production of other capital . In short , the surplus production of goods which we have spoken of as savings , is turned over to those who own or ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various factors of production and may be entirely consumed by these persons ; but in due time there issues from the cooperation of these factors a stock of equipment goods of a value equal to the value of the savings consumed . It appears , then , that roundabout production is gainful but that it involves provision of consumable goods to those who are engaged in ( whose labor or whose property is devoted to ) such production . This means that the persons who provide present goods for the consumption of those engaged in roundabout production must themselves defer or forego , in some degree , present consumption . They must " abstain " from consuming all that they might consume . Hence , abstaining or abstinence has been re- garded as an element in capital construction , as a factor which must be taken account of in a theory of interest . It is to be recognized , of course , that a part of this abstinence may be undergone by the persons themselves who are engaged in roundabout production instead of by others who pay them , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to that extent , the owners of the capital they produce and claimants on its future yield . Evidently enough , addition to the capital equipment of society requires abstinence somewhere , and evidently , too , the mere maintaining of existing equipment , by replacing capital which wears out , involves abstinence from the consumption which might be enjoyed were such replacing not done . The foregoing paragraphs suggest a consideration of the socialistic view that interest as such is always ex-ploitation . According to the doctrine of orthodox socialism , labor produces all value . From this premise it is argued that those who perform the labor should get the entire product . Since they do not get the entire product of industry , the present economic system is asserted to be one of robbery . Of course , as a matter of sound logic , it is impossible thus to distinguish between labor and capital . While it may be true that nothing or next to nothing can be produced by capital without labor , it is likewise true that next to nothing can be produced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery and tools would , indeed , be helpless and might easily perish . So much the socialist would perforce admit , but he would perhaps reply that , although labor must use capital , capital is but the child of labor , that capital is only an intermediate step between the putting forth of labor and the securing of the full product of labor . This reply , however , hardly gives a full account of the matter . Capital is always a surplus above the needs of present consumption . Hence its creation involves not only labor but also a refraining from the present consumption of the products of labor . I n short , as we have seen , the creation of capital involves  | abstinence , or waiting , or saving . The person who , though he labors most efficiently , consumes in current gratification all that his labor produces ( or an equivalent in other goods for which the goods he has produced are exchanged ) , adds nothing to the capital equipment of society . The only persons to whom society owes anything for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving , as well as their labor , the capital comes into existence . And if an increment of capital adds anything to the annual output of the community 's labor force , beyond what this labor force would produce with that much less capital equipment , such an added annual output of industry is certainly made possible by that person or those persons whose saving , whose excess of production over consumption , brought the capital into existence . And , further , provided the person whose production and saving make possible the existence of the capital , gets , as interest on this capital , no more than the use of the capital adds to the production of goods and services which would have been possible without it , he can not be said to be robbing anyone , since no one is worse off than if the accumulator of the capital had never brought it into existence . If the socialist would say , frankly , that , though the accumulator of capital makes possible an addition to the annual product of industry above what all the labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is in that sense the real producer of this additional annual product , nevertheless not he but the other members of society ought to get this additional product , ought to exploit the actual producer of it , we might disagree with the socialist but we could at least understand him . But to say that labor alone produces all wealth is economic nonsense . And in saying this , in the sense in which he does say it , and basin ; ; upon it serious conclusions regarding public policy , the self-styled scientific socialist reveals his system as a pseudoscience . In this regard , nearly all types of socialism seem to be on common ground . Interest appears to be anathema  | to socialists of all or nearly all schools , not merely to those of professed Marxian leanings . Nor can the socialist easily distinguish between wages and interest on other grounds , so as to justify one and condemn the other . He can not , for instance , make an ethical distinction by asserting that wages are a reward for sacrifice and interest a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving may be , for many , a pleasure which they would indulge were no interest paid . Particularly may persons whose incomes are large , save considerable amounts for the benefit of their children without being conscious of appreciable present deprivation . But the labor for which wages are paid may also be , in some cases , not only not a sacrifice , but a continuous source of pleasure . There seems to be a notion , among socialists and some others , that the reason why wages are paid and , also , the reason why wages should be paid , is because labor is unpleasant . It is true that the greater unpleasantness of one kind of work than of another , when the latter does not require a more rare type of ability than the former , gives rise to higher pay for the former . But if all work were a delight ? as some work is to some workers ? those who did the work would not on that account consent to forego their pay . Nor would any employing property owner be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as labor was productive , since he would have to reckon with the competition of other employers to whom productive labor would seem worth hiring . It is because labor produces something that wages are paid and not because labor is unpleasant . Similarly , it is because capital and , therefore , in effect , saving , produces with labor more than labor alone could produce , that interest is paid for the use of capital in industry . Sacrifice , as such , can not be regarded as a virtue apart from any beneficial consequences it may produce , and can not be regarded as entitled , in itself , to any reward . In short , any really careful analysis must lead to the conclusion that interest on capital can be defended by precisely  | the same argument commonly used to justify the wages of labor , viz. , contribution to the productive process . To illustrate , consider how a fisherman can increase his catch . Perhaps he will decide he can do so by building a boat that enables him to go where the fish are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save , i.e. , he must produce , for a time , more than he consumes . The boat is , of course , an excess of his production over his consumption . If he consumes each day all that he produces that day , the boat will never materialize . The larger daily catch after the boat becomes available must be regarded as partly a repayment of the labor of building the boat and partly interest , the extra return made possible by the new capital over what all the owner 's labor , past and present , could produce without it . Wherein can his enjoyment of this interest , this extra return made possible by his own saving , be objected to ? Whom is it supposed that he is robbing ? How can a farmer increase his crop ? He may work to fertilize his land or he may irrigate it or he may plant and bring to maturity an orchard . With the fertilized land he can produce more each year than if the land were not fertilized , and still more , perhaps , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make his labor of future years more productive in the getting of fruit . But in each case he has to save , i.e. , produce for a time more than he consumes . His extra production is not of wheat , corn or fruit but is greater fertility or moisture in the soil , or growing fruit trees . These things are produced in addition to what the farmer consumes . He produces them in additional working hours beyond the time necessary to produce his own current means of livelihood . Or , possibly , he first produces an excess of wheat , corn , etc. , and then lives upon this excess while making the improvements in or on his farm . When , thereafter , the farmer enjoys the larger crops made possible by the fertilization of his land or by its irrigation or by the planting of the fruit trees , the excess produced above what the labor spent in improving the farm  | could have brought him if applied directly to current crop production , is a return due to capital , an extra income made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pinkish " literary intelligentsia who contend that the income received by the owners of capital as such , is a robbery of the masses , explain for us what masses or what individuals the farmer of our illustration is robbing ? In what sense does it take something away from others , for the farmer to save and thereby to make possible a larger production on his farm in future years ? What person is made poorer by the fact that the farmer 's soil is now richer or more effectively watered than before ? In just what way does it injure the masses of working people or " deprive " any worker of " the full product of his labor , " when the farmer 's orchard begins to bear fruit and the farmer receives , thereby , gradual repayment for his temporarily wageless labor of planting , plus an excess which may properly be called interest or income on capital , the reward of his saving and a consequence of the fact that , by saving and thus accumulating capital , we can usually produce more wealth than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is precisely the same when , as is commonly the case , the person who saves does not himself construct the capital but provides the means , from his saving , for someone else to do it . Thus , suppose the farmer of our illustration , whom we shall now call Noren , does not himself fertilize his farm or install the irrigation system or plant the trees , in his extra time ( beyond that necessary to provide for the immediate needs of himself and his family ) , but instead uses that extra time to produce an excess of wheat , potatoes , carrots , peas , etc. , beyond his own needs . This excess he gives to another , whom we shall call Fenton , in order that the latter may be free to improve Noren 's farm . Venton , we may suppose , needs the potatoes , peas , etc . I le wishes to ? perhaps needs to ? consume currently all that he can produce . If someone does not provide him with t he potatoes , peas , etc. , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford to work the requisite number of days  | fertilizing Noren 's farm or making an irrigation system for it or planting trees on it , only if he has something to live on while doing so . If Noren gives him for his work all the potatoes , carrots , peas , etc. , that Fenton could produce for himself in the time he spends improving Noren 's farm , how is Fenton in any way injured ? How is he prevented from enjoying " the full product of his labor ? " It is Noren 's saving that makes possible the improvement of the farm . Fenton has lost nothing whatever . If Noren now enjoys the larger product from his farm which is the result of the improvement made possible by his own saving , in what way is he robbing Fenton ? Fenton is at least as well off as he would have been had Noren not saved . And Fenton is certainly not prevented from saving on his own account , if he desires to do so and can live on less than his current production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is Noren 's saving that is responsible for the increased productiveness of Noren 's farm . Let us change the illustration somewhat , so as to make i both more complicated and more realistic . Noren , the farmer , does not directly give Fenton the wheat , potatoes , carrots and peas , but sells these crops for money ( or bank checks ) and pays the money ( or checks on his bank ) to Fenton who uses it to buy needed food and ( perhaps ) other goods . Noren , we may say , adds to society 's available stock of consumable goods , receives money ( in effect , tickets ) entitling him to use up those goods or their equivalent , and passes this money , or a part of it ( what he saves ) , to Fenton who buys therewith the consumable goods he needs and wants . Thus , Fenton does not have to spend his own time producing goods for immediate consumption but has his time made free ? through Noren 's saving ? for producing capital . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving , by a case still more complicated and one which pictures contemporary investment in corporate industry . A large number of Norens ( so to speak ) , including farmers , bakers , tailors , coal miners , et al. , save , and invest in the stock of a paper manufacturing company which is  | about to construct a paper mill . The company hires a large number of Fentons to make the materials for the mill and do the constructing . The Norens produce more cereals , bread , potatoes , clothing , coal , etc. , than they are themselves consuming . That is to say , they save . The money they receive for this excess ( i. e. , the money they do not spend to satisfy their own current needs and desires ) is paid for ( invested in ) stock of the paper company . The paper company pays it to the Fentons , who are enabled to buy therewith the excess of consumable goods produced by the Norens . Thus , the Fentons have their time set free for the construction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they need , or insist on having , in the form of consumable goods and services , all that they currently earn , ? even though , that is , they themselves save nothing . The saving of the Norens , in short , makes possible a construction of capital by the Fentons . The Fentons are certainly no worse off than if they spent their entire time producing goods for immediate consumption . They are paid , in money exchangeable for the excess consumable goods produced by others , all that their own labor could produce of such goods . The capital they construct could not come into existence without the saving of the Norens . It is the saving of the latter , their production of more than they consume , that makes the construction of the capital possible . If , now , this capital is truly productive , if it does really add to the output of industry an excess over what the labor and all the rest of the capital of the community could have produced without it , and if this excess goes , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the excess production possible , in what way have the Fentons been robbed ? It is , of course , open to " liberal " and " parlor pinkish " critics of property income in the existing economic order , to object that those who save are , in some cases , recipients of income that they never earned and that it is out of such unearned income that they have been able to make their accumulations . Monopoly , unfair competition , use of  | fiduciary positions for personal profit , etc. , may be common means to affluence . None the less , those who so contend ought to take pains to separate these various means of exploitation , at least in thought , and show how each one conduces to give individuals and classes unearned income . Certainly they ought not to lump all such means of privileged income together as " surplus value , " or as inevitably involved in " the profit system . " Nor may they with propriety use discussion of such purely unearned and illicit incomes as a means of making plausible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , interest on capital , which is , in itself , entirely reasonable and justifiable , in the sense that it is merely a quid pro quo for a productive contribution . Interest yielded by capital and the rent yielded on land must not be confused . The foregoing argument showing that interest on capital is normally earned and represents no abstraction of wealth from others , is not applicable to land rent . Land rent , purely as such ? as distinguished from what is paid for the use of buildings , orchards , fertility put into the land , and other improvements on or in land ? , is surely not paid for saving , since the land is not due to anyone 's saving . In other words , land rent is not paid for an added output of industry produced by capital which iii turn has been made possible by individual saving . Rather is it an income which landowners can get for giving to nonlandowners ( in most countries , the great majority ) permission to work on and to live on those parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productive and livable . But this is a problem the consideration of which we shall have to defer to a later chapter . Whether and how far the necessity of abstinence constitutes an explanation of interest depends upon the extent to which it acts as a barrier to saving . If most of the people in the world ? or in a relatively isolated community ? were to abstain willingly from present consumption , devoting nearly all their productive effort to capital formation , the  | supply of machinery and other capital would be large , the gain from further increase of it would presumably be small , and the rate of interest would be low . The theorists who have endeavored to explain interest by reference to abstinence have regarded abstinence as a sacrifice to induce which a payment must be made . They have not attempted to deny that some saving would be done even with no interest payment and , in some cases , have taken pains to assert that a certain amount of saving would nevertheless be done . But they have urged that such saving is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profitably used and that other capital can only be had by virtue of the receipt or expected receipt of a return upon it . The " marginal " saver will not save unless compensated for so doing , and a man who would save something without interest will not save so much , will not save the " marginal dollar unless remunerated . When a person has already saved a considerable sum , has already denied himself a considerable amount of present income for the sake of larger future income , the better relative provision for his future than otherwise and the poorer relative provision for present needs will tend to discourage further savings and to discourage them the more the greater are the savings which he has already made . As Professor Irving Fisher would put it , the time shape of his income stream ( whether falling , level or rising ) affects the individual 's attitude towards saving , affects his degree of " impatience . " The millionaire does not have to practice abstinence , in the sense of making a sacrifice , to save large  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be made without compensation . Interest , in this view , results from a shortage of savings , due to the fact that saving means sacrifice of present desires . We need not , here , defend the thesis that this sacrifice means " pain-cost . " It suffices that there is a mental state which interferes with saving . In the fear that the word " abstinence " might connote pain-cost , some economists have preferred such terms as " waiting , " " time-preference , " or " impatience . " The only essential fact for the purpose ? if it be a fact ? is that when the choice is made between spending and saving , the saver ? at least some savers for some of their saving ? would choose to spend were it not for the interest . The disinclination to save , so far as there is such a disinclination , can be in large part accounted for by the fact that , when choosing between present and future expenditures , the moment of choice is the present . When the future becomes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) significant dates is made backwards in time , it may well be that there will appear to have been a " sacrifice " made if and when earlier consumption was preferred to later ( now present ) consumption , even though such a choice seemed the desirable one when made . If , today , it causes regret ? though it may not always do so ? to plan for next year 's instead of today 's enjoyment , so , when next year becomes this year , it may cause us regret to realize that we chose to have our enjoyment last year and , therefore , can not have it now . We should not hastily conclude , however , if and because there are some who will not save except at a high interest , that high interest has , in general , the result of stimulating saving . That it does have this result has commonly been assumed by economists and is not here denied , but the certainty of its doing so is nevertheless to be questioned .  | There are undoubtedly some persons who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on capital than at a somewhat higher rate . Let us consider the case of a man who wishes to leave to his descendants an income of $5,000 a year , which , in his view , will be sufficient to their needs . If interest is 10 per cent , an accumulated capital of $50,000 will be sufficient for his purpose . But if interest is 5 per cent , it will be necessary for him to save $100,000 in order to leave the desired income to his family without the necessity of their at any time trenching on the capital . He might actually save $70,000 and have to expect some using up , by his family , of the saved funds . That more saving would result or that as much saving would result from lower interest as from higher seems , however , not probable . In the first place , it is fairly likely that a person who would save $100,000 when interest was 5 per cent , that his family might have a $5,000 income , would save more than $50,000 if interest were 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might thus secure as more than compensating the smaller relative sacrifice . Reversing the form of statement , we may say that few persons probably would , because of a lower interest rate , save an enough larger sum to yield the same annual income as they would expect to provide if the rate of interest were higher . There is , indeed , reason to doubt whether the average person would save as much in expectation of low interest as if there were prospects of large gains from the saving . Saving for old age and the saving which is clone through life insurance companies , would yield less return on the same investment . But let us consider the usually larger savings of those who endeavor to provide for their families permanent funded incomes . Will this type of saving not be discouraged ? If we assume as an extreme limit a zero rate of interest , we have an hypothesis  | of a condition under which no return would be yielded on anything less than an infinite sum saved . With no funded income within the realm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts , give up the idea of funded family fortunes , and live for the pleasures of each passing day ? And in lesser degree might not a very low return , say 1 per cent , have a corresponding kind of effect ? In the second place , the possibility of interest being realized carries with it a sort of selection . Those who have the disposition to save soon find themselves realizing interest on their savings and thereby acquire additional ability to save . Those who have not the disposition to save are less likely to gain additional ability to save . The higher interest becomes , the more saving can be done , other things equal , by those who wish to save , and this fact suggests the likelihood of greater aggregate saving at higher interest than at lower . In the price system ( except that we do not maintain it altogether consistently ) , each person produces as much as  | he wants to of whatever he wants to . In this system it is through the lure of prices that men are induced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for goods , for labor , for the use of capital . Those who produce goods produce what they think they can sell profitably . Those who work choose the fields in which they will work , within the limits of their abilities and training , deciding on the basis , largely , of comparative wages . And it is price offers , likewise , that determine what kinds of capital shall be constructed and how and by whom the capital shall be used . Consumers are protected by this very condition of voluntary choice of producers . For , if prices of any goods are too high , the production of such goods becomes so profitable that more labor and capital are drawn into such lines and competition forces the prices down . The price system , then , is a system of voluntary choice as to what to buy , what to produce , what kind of work to do , in what line or lines to invest capital , whether to save or not to save and how much to save . True , there are elements in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst , a considerable part of such compulsion is for the purpose of seeing that the essential ideals of the price system  --  voluntary choice , fair competition , etc. ? are maintained . To this end , misrepresentation and other methods of unfair competition are forbidden . To this end , conspiracy to establish monopolistic control in normally competitive industries is prohibited , ? though not always as effectively as it should be . To essentially this end , rates and prices are regulated , in those industries ? like electric light and power and telephones ? where the waste of competitive duplication of plant is so great as to commend monopoly ; but rates and prices are regulated in such industries , only for the purpose of making them approximate the competitive level , and returns in competitive industries are taken as the norm . To this end , the monetary system is controlled ? or should he ? so that the transactions of our economic life may be carried on in terms of a really stable standard of value .  | To this end , those who prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not know of the conditions under which they are prepared , are held to certain standards of purity . Whether in spite of or primarily because of these elements of government control , the price system leaves to the individual large freedom of choice as to his purchases , his work , his acquisition of capital and how his capital shall be used . In a truly socialistic society there can not be this freedom . For the essence of socialistic philosophy is a conviction that income from property is unearned , regardless of whether the property is land , produced by geological forces , or capital made possible by the work and the saving of the owner . And how , in a socialistic state , are men to be prevented from enjoying income on capital if they are permitted to own the capital ? If a fisherman builds a boat and uses it for fishing , a part of the fish he catches can truly be said to be income from capital . If a farmer plants an orchard , though a portion of the fruit , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his labor of picking and of planting , another portion ( unless the yield is barely enough to cover depreciation ! ) is as certainly interest on his capital in fruit trees . And similarly with factories , steamships and other capital owned by the voluntary groups of persons known as corporations . If , now , all of the interest which their capital yields is regularly taken away from those who have capital , may it not be that most persons will not bother to save ? Or , at any rate , that a great many persons will not save so much ? And without saving there can be no capital . Capital , indeed , adds greatly to the effectiveness of labor and , therefore , to the output of goods . But will men save as eagerly and as much , if the added output from the capital which their saving makes possible , is all to be taken from them for the benefit of the entire public ? Will they save as eagerly for other people 's children as for their own children ? In short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one shall be allowed to derive individual income from his savings ,  | count with certainty on sufficient voluntary saving to provide needed equipment for industry ? Is n't it fairly probable , then , that a social philosophy which repudiates private enjoyment of any income from capital , must envisage having the state take over the function of constructing capital ? And that it must envisage having the state determine how much is to be saved and compel the saving ? At any rate , socialists certainly do not put their trust in any individual saving and capital construction but always contemplate control of saving , and of capital construction , by the state . This means , practically , that the state must own all capital and see that it is kept in repair . It means , also , obviously , that the state must direct the use of capital . As a result , the nation which accepts socialistic ideals inevitably accepts state control of industry . Even if such control were not inevitable in theory , all of us know that it would certainly be insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the control of which no economic life is possible . It is well for us to understand why a government based on a socialistic ideology must be dictatorial in its relations with its citizens . Surely , in regard to saving and the construction of capital , there can be no alternative ; and socialists do not contemplate any alternative . Since individuals can not be ? and certainly are not ? counted on to save adequately when they are not permitted to enjoy individually the fruits of saving , they must be compelled to save . Such compulsory saving does not necessarily mean that citizens will be consciously aware of the compulsion . The government does not say to the individual : " You must save ( say ) twenty-five per cent of what you receive as wages . " I t merely sees to it that the citizen receives less money to spend . It publicizes a " five year plan , " devoting , perhaps , a fifth or a third of the nation 's annually available labor to the construction of capital . Obviously , the labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of future years can not possibly be devoted to making shoes and shirts , to raising potatoes , cab- bages and wheat , to picking apples and cherries and to baking bread . The more of the labor of the people is devoted to constructing capital for the service of the future , the less labor can be devoted to the service of the present and the less the people can have to enjoy this year and next . But in a socialistic state , the individual has no choice in the matter . Government decides for him and allows him , as wages , only what its central planning committee sees fit to allow . If this is not compulsion , what does the word mean ? And are we perfectly certain that a nation can be organized for compulsion in this respect , with the government owning , operating , and increasing or decreasing at its pleasure , all productive capital , yet maintain in its individuals spontaneity , initiative , and a spirit of free inquiry and uninhibited criticism ? But suppose the central planning committee of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the favor of a short-sighted populace , should decide to devote nearly all of the nation 's labor to the provision of food , clothing and entertainment , and almost none to constructing new equipment or even to replacing worn-out equipment . It would then be only a matter of time ? say a decade or two ? before such a nation was so short of the tools of production that it could not produce enough to keep its people alive , and many of them would have to die for lack of clothes and food . But what , in such a socialistic society , could any individual do about the situation ? How could he protect his own children against the threatening years of starvation and despair ? Such a nation would not let him own productive capital , even though he were willing to save and construct it himself , lest he receive private income from it . And the little that he , individually , might accumulate , divided among all the workers of the country , could accomplish nothing microscopically measurable toward improving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own children . In a free society , there will always be some who save , even though it may be only a minority . In our own society ,  | this voluntary saving has given us orchards and buildings , factories and machines , steamships and locomotives , so that the labor of all of us has been more productive . In a free society of the type we have been used to , there always will be saving . For whatever any one person may do , we can count on the law of the constancy of the average . But in a socialistically organized society , everything depends on which way the government jumps . A small majority one way ? or the word of a dictator ? and saving is made compulsory on all . A majority the other way ? or decree from above ? and capital depreciates without being replaced . In either case the individual is nothing and can do nothing . The state , with its compulsion , is everything . In this chapter our endeavor has been to discover the ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation of how these forces cooperate or how the exact rate of interest is determined . By way of preliminary , the factors of production were said to be land , labor and capital . We chose to include the work of the entrepreneur or enterpriser in the category of labor . Capital , it appeared in the course of the chapter , is not an ultimate factor of production but can be resolved into other factors . If we so resolve it , our ultimate factors are land , labor and waiting ( or saving ) . The owner of land receives rent , the owner of capital receives interest ( the return on waiting or saving ) , the laborer receives wages . Capital is produced by labor applied to or on land , usually with the assistance of previously produced capital . Analysis showed that the advantage of using capital in production is really an advantage of applying available factors of production in a longer-time rather than a shortertime process . Since capital is a derivative factor , we may , hearing in mind that labor is applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of using capital is an  | advantage of applying labor so as to bring a relatively remote reward as compared with applying it so as to secure a relatively early reward . Greater roundaboutness of production may mean the lapse of a greater period of time between effort and the enjoyment of its results or it may mean an increase of the proportionate amounts of effort and of land the use of which is directed to securing comparatively distant gains . It should be again emphasized , at this point , that capitalistic production is not always socially beneficial production and that capital is not always material technological equipment . The production of adulterated foods may be carried on capitalistically . And not only well-deserved goodwill , but also public favor due to sedulously propagated misinformation and governmental encouragement due to selfish political activity or even to bribery , may constitute part of a concern 's capital . The seeking of such favor or encouragement means engaging in roundabout production . Nevertheless , though capitalistic processes may be antisocial and the returns received may be therefore unearned , it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ideal economic society , all such anti-social methods of wealth getting would be effectively prohibited and in such a society , therefore , no one could derive income from capital without so using it as to give a corresponding service to the community in return . That all possible kinds of capital , and , therefore , all possible roundabout productions , yield a surplus over direct production was not asserted . But there seem to be enough roundabout applications of labor which do yield , or at least promise , a surplus over direct production , to occupy more of our effort and attention than we are willing to devote to the securing of deferred rewards . Nevertheless , roundabout production appears to yield less the farther it is extended . There is , in this regard , a law of diminishing returns . To increase indefinitely the amount of labor and land devoted to capital production will not proportionately increase the gains from the use of capital .  | There comes to be a relative sufficiency of capital . Nor , apparently , can the durability of capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To say that roundabout production involves waiting is equivalent to saying that capitalistic production involves saving . In roundabout production capital is an intermediate stage between effort and its rewards . The production of capital and likewise its maintenance requires waiting or saving , requires a refraining from the present consumption which would otherwise be possible . The older economists spoke of this refraining as abstinence . Some modern economists speak of it as waiting . Others refer to time-preference or to impatience . Impatience or preference for present income over future income is not universal . The man whose present needs are fully supplied and who anticipates a needy future may definitely prefer future income to present . Even without prospect of surplus gain , many persons may eagerly save for old age or to provide funds for the support and education of their children who may become orphaned . But it is asserted that the sums saved would be less than they are were no surplus return securable by saving . The argument to this effect may not seem to everyone absolutely convincing . There may indeed be persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher . On the whole it seems probable that the lure of a return on accumulated wealth is a real influence in increasing the amount of such wealth and that saving would be much less , the amount of capital less and , therefore , the amount of roundabout production less , if saving and roundabout production did not pay . The value of any capital , when newly constructed , will not ordinarily much exceed or much fall short of its cost of production . And this cost of production can be reckoned in terms of the immediately consumable goods that the labor and other factors producing the capital could have produced instead . The yield of the capital above the amount necessary to replace this cost is a net gain to the  | person who has produced and saved the capital . If he uses the capital himself he receives this entire gain directly . If he lends the capital , he will not knowingly accept as interest much less ; nor will a borrower knowingly pay much more . The demand for and the supply of loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down fluctuations occasioned by alternate deficiency and excess of bank reserves , etc. , to be equalized by a rate of interest which is the same as the rate of net productivity of capital . Since this net productivity of capital is made possible by the saving without which there would be no capital , the contention of socialists that interest on capital is not earned but is the fruit of robbery , can not be justified . And their practical program is perhaps not made more attractive to a people accustomed to a free ? at least mostly free ? industrial system , by the fact that it seems inevitably to involve general industrial regimentation .  | Before considering in detail the working out of the forces determining interest in modern society , let us ask how these various forces would act upon an islanded Crusoe . The Crusoe of the story begins his isolation , not absolutely without capital , since something is saved from the wrecked ship , but with comparatively little capital . As he has leisure from the activities necessary for present support of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued existence on the island . He builds himself a house , cuts a boat out of a log , makes himself bow and arrows , accumulates a herd of goats , and in other ways prepares himself against the contingencies of the future . To do this , he has of necessity , either to lay aside a store of food for use while producing equipment or to devote a part of his time each day or week , while producing the equipment , to the production of necessary food . In either case he may be said to use part of his labor for purposes other than the satisfaction of his immediate wants , to practice abstinence in not immediately consuming all that his labor produces , to wait for enjoyments that he might have currently , to save or accumulate the results of a part of his labor against the possibilities of future use . And in either case this saving  | takes , eventually , the form of buildings , tools , flocks and herds , orchards , etc . In accumulating these various kinds of equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of satisfying his later needs . He might get along by consuming such sea food as he could find , in various depressions and crannies , after the outflow of the tides . He chooses rather to deny himself some immediate satisfactions in order to make a net and fishing lines . He might plan to use the net and lines from the shore or by wading out in the water . Instead he prefers to sacrifice , in part , the early income thus securable , and to devote some of his time to building a boat . He might hunt all over the island for a goat to kill , whenever he was hungry for meat . He chooses , however , to make the sacrifice , early in his islanded life , either of consuming less meat or of spending more time in goat capture , so that , later , a minimum of labor may provide him with a maximum of meat . For a like reason he builds fences to keep his captured goats from escaping . In all this turning of labor to remote ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume the most important , the most advantageous capital to be constructed first . It is important to have a net , less important but still worth while to have a boat . Likewise , progressive improvements in the quality of the tools and buildings required , have progressively less and less importance . Crusoe must , therefore , decide at what point he no longer cares to make present sacrifices for the larger but **28;1401;TOOLONG , future gains . At the beginning , having little accumulated capital to work with , Crusoe has to devote much of his time to supplying present necessaries . He can devote little time to producing equipment , just because he has but little equipment to work with . For the same reason the time he is able to devote to producing equipment does not provide him with any large amount of it . But roundabout production is of the greater relative advantage to him so far as he can carry it on , just because he can afford to resort to it so little ; and this large per  | cent gain may tempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly can do so . He practices abstinence , abstaining , so far as he can , from present consumption , for the sake of the gains to be realized by so doing . When he begins to realize these gains , to enjoy the larger production which his equipment makes possible , or to produce the old necessities in less time , he will be able to spare more time for the further elaboration of tools ; but the per cent gain from so doing will be reduced . With his already accumulated tools , Crusoe 's labor directed to providing immediate satisfactions is now much more effective than formerly . More or better tools might result in further gain but the gain becomes progressively smaller . ' But in all this , though we have influences of the kind which bear upon the rate of interest , we do not have a problem of interest such as exists in modern society . A Crusoe may , indeed , compare present goods and future . He may determine that his home is the equivalent of a certain amount of food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thus showing that he regards it as preferable to those enjoyments . In a sense he values it in terms of the kind of enjoyments sacrificed . But there is lacking an alternative which exists in organized society as we know it and which has considerable significance , the alternative , that is , of devoting himself to producing either present or future goods and securing the other type of goods by exchange . He may produce the one type of goods or the other , and he may determine how much of the one type he will have and how much of the other and when it no longer seems worth while to devote an extra hour to the one purpose to the exclusion of the other purpose . But he can not take advantage of his own specialized skill and that of another , to devote himself to one line of production and trade the results for the products of an- other line . There is not open to him , isolated as he is , the chance to make capital for others who have not saved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital as to have little to gain from the production for his own use alone of more . Obviously , too , he can not devote himself entirely to production for the future , e.g. , to making a boat , and expect to trade the results of his labor for present income , e.g. , fish . Neither can he , if he would have any tools of production , devote himself entirely to producing consumable goods and trade these with anyone else for production goods . Could he do these things , the rate at which he would trade the one kind of goods for the other might well be influenced by his alternative of himself producing the other . Thus , the rate at which he would exchange consumable goods for capital might well be affected by the alternative of his producing that capital . There are , of course , points of similarity in the position of a Crusoe and a man who is part of an industrial society , but it seems nevertheless necessary , fully to explain the phenomena of interest , to consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchanges and alternatives which have a bearing upon it . What is added to production by any one unit of capital is less if capital is plentiful than if capital is scarce . The net product yielded by the last added unit of capital , at the point or line or " margin " beyond which no more capital has been accumulated , is called the marginal product of capital . Since capital construction depend upon saving or " waiting , " the added net output made possible by the last added unit of capital may he called the marginal product of saving or of waiting . Thus , if a given amount of labor can yield an immediate product of 100 or can , by being stored in capital , yield a  | product one year later of 110 , then the surplus product , 10 , may be spoken of as the marginal product of " waiting , " or the marginal product of saving . If we measure waiting by amount of gratification postponed and duration of postponement , ' we may say that the marginal product of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will help in making clear the principles involved , to use a simple illustration such as this one of a ten per cent greater return from labor through a roundabout process that stores the labor in capital and brings the return a year later . But of course the labor of constructing the capital is not put forth at one moment , nor is the service yielded by the capital ordinarily yielded in just a moment . On the contrary , the construction of the capital requires a period of time and the products or services yielded by it are yielded during a period of time . In what sense , then , shall we say that ? in our present illustration ? the benefits derived from the labor devoted to constructing the capital are received just a year later than the performing of the labor ? May we not take a " center of gravity " in time of the work of constructing the capital and a " center of gravity " in time of the receiving of the benefits of this work , and say that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if thereby the return is 10 per cent greater , then the marginal product of waiting or saving is at the rate of 10 per cent a year ? Thus , suppose that in producing certain goods capitalistically , labor is put forth daily for a year in constructing capital but that during this year no consumable return is derived , the return being realized throughout the second year , during which the capital produced is operated and wears out . The time center of gravity of the labor of construction would then be half a year from the beginning of the process and the time center of gravity of receiving the return would be a year and a half from the beginning . The return may therefore be  | said to be received a year later than the labor is put forth . And if this return is 10 per cent larger than could have been secured by carrying on direct production and getting consumable goods currently with the productive effort , then the marginal product of waiting or saving may be said to be 10 per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While cherry producing , as a whole , is roundabout , the picking of the cherries , taken by itself , is direct or nearly direct production . The labor of planting , cultivating , etc. , is roundabout production , for its ultimate result in cherries is available only a considerable time after the labor is exerted . This labor of planting and cultivating has to be supported by the present goods provided by savers . It is the investment in this roundabout production and the waiting for its result , that is rewarded by interest . From the point of view of determining the duration of waiting for a return on this investment , we leave out of our reckoning , of course , the work of picking the cherries . The duration of the waiting naturally comes out as greater , on the average , since we do not include in our average the part of the labor which immediately produces consumable goods but only the part which does really involve waiting and can so be regarded as invested over a period . Although part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other goods ) must be considered as reward for the labor of picking , another part must be reckoned as deferred return , including interest , on the labor of planting and caring for the trees . If we suppose this labor of planting the trees and caring for them until they have matured , to be evenly  | distributed over the first ten years , its time center of gravity may be reckoned as five years from the beginning . Then if the reward of this labor , in the form of cherries , is evenly distributed over the last twenty years , the center of gravity in time of receiving this reward is twenty years from the time when planting was begun . Thus the duration of the waiting , the average length of time between the investment of the labor and the securing of its result in consumable goods , would be reckoned as fifteen years . We have seen that roundabout production may be made to yield a surplus over what direct production can yield . The anticipation of such a surplus brings about an interest rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for future . In studying these transactions we shall consider the demand side of the market to include all who are demanders of present goods , in the sense that they are willing and anxious to give future goods for present ( or later goods for earlier ) . Those who are willing to make such an exchange belong to two distinct classes . Some desire to make such an exchange because they want to have more goods to enjoy in the present , even at the expense of having less ? perhaps a great deal less ? in the future . They are said to have a certain rate of preference for the present goods as compared with future goods . But our first consideration will be of the other class of demanders of present goods , viz. , demanders of present goods who do not want such goods as a means of increasing their present enjoyment but who want these goods rather as a means of enabling them to carry on roundabout production and so to realize a larger future output .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
