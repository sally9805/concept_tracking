txt How to turn a bushel of wheat into a bushel of rye is being demonstrated here in Canada . Also : How to " protect " farmers into a mood for producing less of the major bread cereal . It 's a talc of government control over grain prices and marketing . - And it might make good bedtime reading , " says one Canadian wheat man , " for any U. S. officials who may be now toying with the idea of clamping sharper restraints on free markets because of rising prices . " When the war ended . Canada 's government decided to keep its grains sternly in hand . The only exception was rye . Snug price ceilings were held over kingpin wheat and the other lesser cereals . Rye was left free . Pain in Grain The result has been ironic and painful . With the worst wheat hunger of modern times gripping the globe , and with southern-neighher 1.7 . S. expanding its wheat fields vastly . Canada 's farmers this year actually planted 10% fewer acres to wheat than in the peak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with rye . Fancyfree rye has tripped lightly up the price laddcr . And this year Canadian farmers , being able to distinguish a dollar from a doughnut , planted some 40% more acres in rye than they did in 1946 . Grain experts say they will open the rye production throttle further next year . This Is true despite the strong natural disinclination of farmers to convert wheat lands to rye . Reason for reluctance : The rye . once planted on a patch of land , keeps popping up year after year . like dandelions in your front yard . whether you want it or notThe Canadian farmer 's wheat price punsge back to July of last year . At that . time Canada sifgreed to sell Britain 600 million bushels of wheat  --  practically the total Canadian export supply  --  over a period of four years . " When the agreement was negotiated , everyone thought there would be a bust . " says the manager of a big grain firm here . " The air was thick with pessimism . " So , to " protect " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England the proviso that the British buying price for two years would be $1.55 a bushel . ( Britain has recently agreed to pay $2 after August 1 . 1948.1 Canadian pessimism at the time was further indicated in the stipulation that the British buying price in the third year of the agreement would be at least $1.25. and in the fourth year at least $1 . But the downward trend in world wheat prices did n't " pan out " as expected . ? World prices skyrocketed . The Canadian farmer 's " protection " became a chain about his neck . Worth $3 in Chicago In order to deliver the wheat to England at $1.55 , the Canadian government pays the farmers a fixed price of $1.35 a bushel , on a delivered-at-Ft William basis . Wheat in Chicago brings $3 . But that does n't help Canadians . All their wheat must be sold through their government . Over the first year of this " farmer-protecting " agreement , world wheat prices averaged 77 cents a bushel over the $1.55 paid by England , laments the Winnipeg Free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equivalent to a loss of $123.2 million to Canadian farmers on the 160 million bushels of wheat sold in the crop year ended August 1 . 1947 . The Canadian government , meanwhile , is in the red-faced position of not being able to lift the wheat price lid even if it wanted to without blasting its agreement made with England . Apart from dampening interest in wheat planting , the fixed price is having other troublesome effects upon the farm gentry . ? What 's the Hurry , " With the government straining to get wheat from the farms as rapidly as possible , the fixed price gives farmers a " What 's the hurry ? " attitude . This was noticeable as long ago as last fall . England was screaming for wheat " Pipelines " were empty . Officials cried for grain . ' But Canada 's farmers dawdled . On cold days they did n't even bother to haul grain to town . England 's recent promise to pay $2 a bushel for wheat beginning next August 1 threatens even more serious holding back of grain this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2 price to Britain goes into effect , the price paid to farmers ( Ft . William basis ) may be jumped from the present $1.35 to between $1.50 and $1.85 . A lot of farmers think so , too , and it is feared many of them will hold back all the grain they can until next August . Theoretically , the farmer has nothing to gain by this holding . A complicated system of eventual repayments to farmers is supposed to protect him against any losses he might incur as a result of a price boost after he has sold : but farmers are skeptical of this set-up . They have a " bird-in-hand " attitude . Anticipation of higher prices in also giving tr. ? tibia In other Canadian grains . A rumor that oats and barley will soon he decontrolled has dammed back the flow-to-market of these cereals . Sitting Tight To demonstrate the oats-barley stagnar Lion , a top official of a big Winnipeg elevator firm pulled a yellow sheet out of his desk . It showed in the past 10 days farmers have sold less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his fIrm 's elevators ; the rest they are just storing with him , but retaining ownnership . Normally , said this grain executive . those farmers would be selling at least 95 ' 7 : - . of that grain . Because western farmers wo n't sell oats and barley , which are as important for livestock feeding here as corn is in the U. S . there 's an acute shortage of these grains In the eastern deficit feed areas . Black market prices as much As 20 cents a bushel above official prices have been paid in Ontario for oats and barley , grain men here report . With price ceilings still on meat and livestock , - this means farmers who are feed.ng cattle and hogs will either have to take a loss on above-ceiling grain they have used or else market their stock in the black market . But the wheat farmer is largely denied the pleasures and profits of black market operation Since his grain is primarily for human consumption as flour , it must be taken to an elevator for marketing . And once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the government . Defenders of the government " protection " program for wheat say it guarantees farmers price - stabilization " The attitude of the farmer is reported by Stanley N. Jones , prestdent of the Winnipeg Crain Exchange Sat% a he " The fainter is wondering it stabilization has not been secured at too great a cost . The . stable market promised steins to has been realized at a level very near the bottom . "
