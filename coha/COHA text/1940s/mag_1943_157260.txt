Lettuce-growing , ballyhoo-loving Salinas , Calif , was bursting with civic pride last week : homegrown , natural rubber in small but commercial quantities was bouncing from its Government-owned guayule-processing mill . Pounding , chopping and sloshing away night &; day at mounds of tough , dry guayule shrubs harvested and baled in the fields near by , the little mill was turning out six tons of 100%-California rubber every 24 hours . <P> Within about three months the Salinas mill will have ground its way through all the guayule now available ( it takes two to three years to grow to commercial size ) . But if the Government 's growing program in the Southwest pans out , there will be enough to produce 21,000 tons in late 1944 , and perhaps 80,000 tons in 1945 . <P> By that time the synthetic rubber program should also be going full blast . That will make guayule production look like peanuts . But unless synthetic tire technology improves enormously between now and next year , every pound of guayule will still be badly needed , because it still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Considering that the Nazis , with 25 years of synthetic rubber experimentation behind them , still mix crude with synthetic rubber , Salinas has good cause to feel safe and strategic-at least for the duration .
