Through the drab streets of Paris ' Red Belt the grim word flashed : " Comrades , to the barricades ! The Virgin of Boulogne is coming ! " <P> Factory and tenement poured forth their faithful proletarians . No one sang the a ira , no one screamed , " la lanterne ! " But horny fists were raised and Marxist throats intoned the Internationale . At Ivry-sur-Seine , across the high road from the south , rose a barrier of cars , trucks and packing boxes . <P> Save France ! Up from the vernal south the gold-and-plaster Virgin moved triumphantly . Twentieth-Century France hailed the religious procession , a war-delayed commemoration of the Virgin 's 1,300th anniversary . The faithful were as reverent now as on that miraculous Sunday in 638 when the fishermen of Boulogne found the Virgin , then a prow on an unmanned ship that sailed to anchor despite the harbor 's shoals . They were as ardent now as when mighty Charlemagne , or splendid Francis I , or Sun King Louis XIV made pilgrimage to her shrine . <P> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , roses and carnations . In Antibes , barefoot sailors escorted her to the parish church . Everywhere provincial roads resounded with the prayers of kneeling suppliants : " Virgin , our hope , save France . . . . " And now , borne forward on a peasant 's cart by sweating seminarists , the Virgin of Boulogne came to the Red Belt barricades . <P> No Opium ! Behind the rampart , the Marxists of Ivry truculently cried : " We want no opium for the people ! Down with the Church ! " Before the rampart , young acolytes swung their censers , priests muttered Ave Marias , the Virgin serenely waited . Suddenly a handful of police appeared , led the Virgin to a safe night 's rest in the Church of Ivry . <P> Next day the Virgin rolled deeper into the Red Belt . But the tocsin had sounded . When she came to Thiais , the proletarians were gathered , several thousand strong . For Marx and Mary , fists flew , clubs thudded . Again police broke up the fray . Out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one priest to spend the night in jail . <P> Arise ! Awake ! From red Thiais the road led on to red Charenton . The Virgin faced it , undaunted and yet unscarred . But the police , now alarmed and mobilized in strength , would not face it . They snatched the Virgin from her cart , dumped her on a truck , whisked her at 40 miles an hour to the Charenton church . <P> On foot the Catholic faithful followed . A gantlet of Marxists thundered their anthem : <P> Arise , ye prisoners of starvation . . . <P> Arise , ye slaves , no more in thrall . . . <P> The Catholics shouted Libert ! Libert ! as revolutionaries had once chanted it in those same suburbs . Then they burst into the Marseillaise , which for 150 years was anathema to conservative clerics but had now become an answer to the Internationale . <P> Ye sons of France , awake to glory . . . <P> Shall . . . hireling hosts , a ruffian band , <P> Affright and desolate the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 suburbs of Paris the Catholics planned to carry the Virgin of Boulogne .
