At Brookhaven , L.I. , a dragline excavator manned by a nuclear physicist broke ground last week for the first chain-reacting pile to be built in the U.S. in peacetime. * Financed by a $10 million Government appropriation , it will be the heart of the great Brookhaven National Laboratory , to be built by the U.S. as a common experiment center for the nuclear scientists of Eastern universities . Other atomic giants will soon cluster around it : cyclotrons , synchrotrons , a Van de Graaff electrostatic generator-all the monstrous machines of the Atomic Age . <P> Brookhaven 's pile is designed primarily for research ; it will produce little or no explosive plutonium . From its graphite and uranium interior will come a more plentiful supply of the radioactive isotopes which are already transforming U.S. science . Through its thick shield will shoot the neutrons which are powerful research tools . An elaborate " hot laboratory " will study the dangerous substances and radiations coming from the pile . <P> At last week 's ground-breaking cere , mony there was some talk of peacetime research , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone present knew some of the things that atomic science offers to humanity : new medical advances , a deeper understanding of biology , perhaps unlimited energy to do the world 's heavy work . But it may be a very long time before science can get busy on such matters . Commissioner Sumner T. Pike of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission did not sound very encouraging about it . Peaceful applications of nuclear science , he said , have " an A-2 priority . " They will continue to have a secondary rating until there is international agreement on control of atomic activities . For the present , " our principal job on the commission is to provide bombs , and I am afraid it will be for a long time . " <P> <P> *Britain 's first pile , at Harwell near Oxford , began operation last week . Officially it is a " gleep " ( graphite low energy experimental pile ) .
