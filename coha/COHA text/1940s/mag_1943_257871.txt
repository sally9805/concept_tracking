Thien Pe is a young Burmese author who had no love for the British when they controlled his country , less for the Japs after they took Burma from the British . He remained in Burma for two months after its conquest by Japan , then escaped via India to Chungking . There he wrote a book , What Happened in Burma , and it was published last week in India . <P> The essence of his conclusions : Burma can not be rewon by arms alone ; the Burmese people must first be won , and they can only be won if British political strategy in the Far East is improved . Author Thien Pe addressed himself to the British and to Burma , but his premise applied as well to the U.S. and to all of Asia . <P> Japan Did It .

They also fostered an underground Burma Independence Army and acquired the support of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once imprisoned . Thirty-two nationalists were smuggled to Japan , there trained as pro-Japanese agitators . Inept British administrators did nothing effective to offset these preparations .

It openly disdained the freedom-loving neutrals , and it foolishly mistrusted the Communists . " According to Thien Pe .

The population at large was indifferent to both the Japs and the British . But the aid of the pro-Japanese minority was vital . <P> The Allies Can Do It . The Japs soon disillusioned the Burmese . Jap soldiers looted and raped . The Japanese made Puppet Ba Maw the nominal dictator of a nominally independent Burma , but they broke many of their promises .

Author Thien Pe 's belief is that Allied armies never can do well without help from the Burmese . And , said he : " If Britain hopes to gain the active support of the Burmese she must capture their imagination . "
