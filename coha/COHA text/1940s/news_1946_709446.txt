txt Letters to The Times RICHARD H. WELS . New York April 27 , 1946 . JAMES C. AUCHINCLOSS , M.C. Washingt ... Letters to The Times Citizenship for Guamians Delay in Legislative Action Needs Correction , It Is Said To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Last June Mr. Joseph R. Farrington , Delegate in Congress from Hawaii , introduced H. R. 3528 , to confer United States citizenship upon the natives of Guam . It is understood that hearings will shortly be held by the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization , to which this bill has been referred , on the subject . It was particularly fitting that Delegate Farrington , who represents another group of Pacific islanders in Congress , should have sponsored this legislation . When , some time back , legislation was introduced into Congress to compensate the Guamians for the damage . inflicted upon their homes and cities by our returning forces , Mr. H. Struve Hensel , then Assistant Secretary of the Navy , said : " The affairs of Guam have been administered in the interests of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wards of the Navy . Thus , the United States has a definite responsibility to protect the inhabitants of the island . The Japanese invasion and occupation resulted in extensive damage to private property on the island . Further damage resulted from our reconquest . As a result of the two periods of combat and the actions of the Japanese occupying force during the interim , the people of Guam have suffered extensively . * * * The goodwill of the islanders toward the Navy was responsible for no small part of the comparative ease with which reconquest took place and , moreover , was responsible for many of the difficulties of the Japanese on the island . * * * " It is surely no part of the gratitude of a great nation for the bill conferring citizenship on the Guamians to have been bottled up in the Committee on Immigration and Naturalization for almost a year without any action at all . Such a disregard for the interests of people who have been loyal Americans , and who have made greater sacrifices than many of our people at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations which we are today seeking to translate into reality . Fair dealing , like charity , begins at home , and we should take the necessary measures to redress the situation of the Guamians before we intervene in the problems of Iran , India and Indonesia . It is hoped that THE TIMES and its readers will urge upon the Committee of Immigration and Naturalization the necessity of full hearings and swift action on this laudable legislation . One further word . Secretary Hensel 's comment that " the affairs of Guam have been administered in the interests of the naval station and the native inhabitants have been considered wards of the Navy " has been the keystone of our entire policy toward Guam for almost half a century . In a misguided belief that the needs of the Navy required the island to be sealed off from the world , we have made it a sort of Forbidden City , and have arrested its economic and political development , in sharp contrast to the manner in which the neighboring islands of Saipan and Tinian were developed by the Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be not only the payment of a great debt which we owe them . It should be the first step toward the full economic and political development of the island , and the establishment of some measure of self-government . Coast Guard Praised New Jersey Representative States Need For Its Services To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I was very much interested to read the editorial " The Coast Guard , " in THE TIMES on April 25 , because this is a subject which has been very close to my heart , and to which I have been giving considerable thought and attention . As I represent the New Jersey coast running from Sandy Hook to a few miles north of Atlantic City , I am well aware of the excellent services which the Coast Guard has always rendered the people along the coast , and they have become so accustomed to it and dependent on it that naturally they consider it in the light of an indispensable service . During the coming season there will be many small craft employed in fishing offshore which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a terrible thing if disaster should overtake them with no help at hand . With this in view and after consulting with the Commandant of the Coast Guard , I have drafted a bill which I shall introduce as soon as the Congress reconvenes . It will authorize the Coast Guard , under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury , to enlist not more than 2,000 men for a period of six months for service at lifeboat stations within the continental limits of the United States , and these recruits will be accepted only from previous members of the Coast Guard who have had experience . I am hopeful that prompt action may be secured on this measure because it is for the protection of our citizens , and I heartily endorse your statement that " a pinchpenny budget is not deserved by the Coast Guard . " JAMES C. AUCIINCLOSS , M. C. Washington , April 26 , 1946 . Use for Air Warden Funds TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The former Air Warden Service did a fine job during the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their treasuries . There can not be a worthier cause than to donate these funds to the Greater New York Fund . One of our posts donated $220 last week . Another will send 8120 . Let all zones , sectors and posts of the former Air Warden Service act now . I. F. SHERMAN , Former Sector Commander . Brooklyn , April 29 , 1946 . Personal Touch Possible Suggestions Are Given for Securing Names of Families Abroad TO THE EDITOR OF THE Nsw YORK TIMES : Recently you published a letter from Caroline Kaufherr requesting information as to names of specific families in Europe to whom she and others might send food parcels . There are many groups which will give individual names and addresses , if one will write for them . For instance , to mention but a few : American Relief for Italy , American Relief for Poland , American Relief for Holland . There are groups for other countries also and , in addition , there is an organization known as C. A. R. E. , Cooperative for American Remittances to Europe , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foregoing have offices in New York . Then , of course , there is the American Friends Service Committee at 20 South Twelfth Street , Philadelphia . Certainly the personal touch is of value , and , while the peoples abroad need everything we can send them , it is even more helpful in aiding any family to know exactly what items are longed for or are of importance to their existence . ELIZABETH BENTLEY . New York , April 25 , 1946 . Help for French Children TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Here is an answer to the letter of Caroline Kaufherr in your issue of April 20 , asking " How does one go about finding an organization that can supply names and addresses of specific needy Europeans ? " American Relief for France Headquarters at 39 East Thirty-sixth Street in this city , has the names and addresses of thousands of French children who need help . Every child 's background is recorded in this information received directly from France after it has been carefully verified by French social service organizations on the spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by promising to send him or her two packages of food or clothing per month , for six months or a year . Correspondence with the children or with older members of their families is an essential part of the plan , and Americans cooperating in the ARF childpackage program have already received many touching letters of gratitude , as well as specific suggestions as to what the particular child needs most . Thus an eminently personal relationship is established . GEORGETTE PERKINS , Deputy Director Overseas Division . New York , April 22 , 1946 . Czechoslovakians Aided To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The letter in THE TIMES of April 20 from Caroline Kaufherr in reference to the desirability of personal contacts between donors of food parcels and their recipients overseas is fully justified . These families are not only hungry for food , but friendly words of encouragement through correspondence are also very necessary and would have a psychological effect on those receiving them . Our office has over 1,600 names and addresses of families whose men were executed by the Nazis or tortured to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address of a family from us , at 8 West Fortieth Street . RUZA L. STUERM , American Friends of Czechoslovakia . New York , April 27 , 1946 . Stone Anecdote Recalled To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES t In your excellent obituary of Chief Justice Harlan F. Stone you mention the fact that when Stone was nounnated as associate justice of the United States Supreme Court in 1925 , the late Senator George W. Norris opposed the nomination . Norris associated Stone with luxury and monopoly because he was a partner in the law firm of Satterlee , Canfield &; Stone ; and Satterlee was a son-ia-law of J. Pierpont Morgan . You should , I think , have related also that when , in 1941 , Stone was nominated as Chief Justice of the United States , Senator Norris manifested his characteristic sincerity and honesty by declaring to his colleagues : " Mr. President , the nomination by the President of Mr. Justice Stone to become Chief Justice of the United States is a very proper and commendable recognition of the ability , courage and wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice of the Supreme Court for quite a number of years . When Mr. Stone was appointed an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court , many years ago , I opposed the confirmation of his nomination and voted against it . In the years that have passed I became convinced , and am now convinced , that in my opposition to the confirmation of his nomination I was entirely in error . I am now about to perform one of the most pleasant duties that has ever come to me in my official lif0 when I cast a vote in favor of his elevation to the highest judicial office in our land . " To eat crow in public is not generally considered a pleasant activity ; but George Norris was sincerely grateful for the opportunity publicly to right a wrong he had committed . Both he and Stone always acted by the best light available to them , and did not hesitate to reverse themselves when new facts and urgent considerations compelled their honest minds to do so . Both rose above party , class and caste . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1946.
