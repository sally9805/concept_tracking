THE HIGH HILL A Story MARY DEASY T WENTY years ago , when I was six years old and went to school for the first time , the new theories of child education had n't made much impression yet on the public school system , and we still sat all day in one varnished , black-boarded , chalk-smelling room , fighting our way through the thorny prickles of the alphabet , and laying the first staggering foundations of the art of writing . Miss Farrell , our teacher , was red-haired and young and Irish , and she threw herself into the labor of instruction with an earnestness that left her sometimes , I suppose , full of the tears of a sense of desperate inadequacy behind the flushed cheeks , the curling hair , the dark-blue eyes with the Celtic shadows beneath them , that were all that we , with our pride in the possession of a young , pretty teacher , could see . No doubt she had her moments of self-searching and frightened emptiness , when it must have seemed to her that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board had hired her , that of making literate citizens out of us , and in the task which she had imposed on herself , of leading us into the paths of the passionate conviction of human brotherhood that was the mixed legacy of her Irish blood and her American birth . I can remember her eager voice sounding the words that came to us , secure in the closed hidden valley in which children live , with a meaning still too evanescent for us to graspwords that said love and mercy and tolerance , ripe round syllables that broke and vanished in the thin harsh air of our simpler world . Miss janiek , from the third-grade room across the hall , talked to her about it after school , sitting in Miss Farrell 's big varnished chair behind the desk , while Miss Farrell , standing beside her , gave her half her attention , the other half being directed at those of us who had stayed behind to erase the blackboards and gather the chalk neatly into white dusty boxes . " They 're little savages , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We felt her gaze wandering over us with the darkness , the tenderness , the pungent vitality in it that we sensed without understanding . " Sitting there and watching a person with those blank clear eyes of theirs , " she said . And then : " School-teaching ! The women who bore those children do n't understand them , and yet they expect us to take a good three dozen of them and get inside their minds somehow , put knowledge and skill and morality there  --  And you 're lucky if after three years you 've taught them to hold a pen , and add two pairs of figures , and squeeze out the meaning of a row of letters set end to end , that spell out a sentence nobody from the beginning of time was ever interested in reading : The cat runs , the dog jumps ? " " No , " Miss Farrell said . " There 's more than that . " She said the words again : mercy , and loyalty , and understanding . " We learned , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't born knowing , any more than they were . Now it 's our turn to teach ? " " We 're going now , Miss Farrell , " Sisley Ross said . W E MAY forget the others , the anonymous outgrown faces , the long-ago names of earliest schoolfellows ; but none of us will forget Sisley Ross . because she was the girl with the spun-sugar curls and the cornflower-blue eyes and the pink-and-white dresses , the doll-heroine of our earnest dreams , as perfect and as unattainable as if , fashioned of wax or bisque , she had sat serenely staring from a shop-window , with a price tag , on which there appeared a figure beyond the most fantastic imagined limits of our parents ' generosity , dangling quietly from one wrist . She stood in the doorway now ; Margot Berry was beside her , waiting to walk home with her , daring any of us , with the imperious , watchful glance of her light-blue eyes , to dispute her prerogative . ? " C-a-t , cat , " Miss Janiek said . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you 've got to earn your salary . Teach them the immutable rule of two plus two . " " Good night , Miss Farrell , " Sisley said . " Good night , Miss Janiek . " " Good night , children , " Miss Farrell said . And to Miss Janiek : " There 's more than that . You know it too . " Miss Janiek wore on the third finger of her left hand a gold ring with a diamond held in it by tiny prongs of gold . It was an engagement ring , but she was not engaged any more , because the man who had given her the ring had been a flier in the war ( having given up teaching the French language safely and quietly in a city high school to fly the French skies , where there was no need for any language but the stuttering burst of a machine gun ) , and he had been killed , so that she was left with nothing but the ring , and a photograph , and a memory that seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the invariable shapeless brown dresses that she wore . There was something about her that reminded us vaguely of our own mothers , as if , without in the least re-sembling them , she brought to us the same aura of maternal warmth ; we knew this instinctively , reading behind manner and speech to the warmth inside , while the other teachers wondered audibly at the attraction she had for us , she who rarely said a word to us that was not spoken in a tone of fierce and desperate exasperation . I remember the day she brought Elvy Morgum into our room . It was in the morning , and we had just sat down in our places when the door banged open and she came in , thrusting before her a girl of our own age  --  a small girl , hatless , her features narrow , with a curiously granitelike sharpness about them , beneath a harsh tangle of hair , above an old black cut-down coat of worn velveteen . " Here 's another one for you , " she shouted to Miss Farrell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elvira , Morgum ; it does n't seem to make much difference ; there are Morgums all over the place this morning , and none of them , not even the oldest , seems to know . They tell me there are four more , younger than this one , still at home , so it looks as if you 'll have them in permanent supply , as long as they stay in the neighborhood . " With her hand still on Elvy Morgum 's shoulder , she gave her a slight thrust forward toward Miss Farrell 's desk . We watched as Elvy moved reluctantly across the front of the room , seeing the hitch and drag of one foot as she walked . She stopped beside Miss Farrell 's desk , and Miss Farrell said clearly , stretching out one hand to her : " Elvy Morgum . What a pretty name . " " Pretty or not , it 's what she 'll have to do with till the Lord or a man releases her , " Miss Janiek said . " The one I 've got is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The whole herd of them came wandering in here this morning without parent or guardian , so there 's a little confusion about some of the biographical data . " Miss Farrell shook her head ; she was smiling , looking over at Miss Janiek . " I 'm one of nine myself , " she said . " It 's an active life  --  especially for the mother . " She looked back at Elvy Morgum . " I have six brothers and two sisters , Elvy , " she said to her . " Would you like to tell me how many you have ? " Elvy stood there at the front of the room without speaking . She looked at Miss Farrell with a dark , wary look , taking her all in , the white soft blouse and the blue skirt and the eyes that were smiling at her , waiting for her to speak . " The whole set of them are like that , " Miss Janiek said . " Silent . Wild . You 'd think there was n't a tongue in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I will , " Miss Farrell said . She took Elvy 's hand , and brought her down the aisle , and let her sit at a desk behind Sisley Ross 's . Sisley turned round to look at her , not smiling , only staring at her curiously , with her sweet blue-eyed doll 's stare . " This is Sisley Ross , Elvy , " Miss Farrell said . " Sisley , would you like to show Elvy where to put her coat ? " " Yes , Miss Farrell , " Sisley said . Even her voice was a doll 's prompt obedient pipe at the proper pressure of a button . We watched her go down the aisle , plump and firm in her pink dress and ruffles , with EIvy Morgum toiling slowly behind , hitch and drag , hitch and drag , her figure witchlike in profile above the bunchy black coat . L. , . / . T HAT was sometime late in January By mid-February Miss Farrell must have hidden even more often than before the tears of her sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Celtic eyes that she showed to us ; for she had watched us now every day , for almost a month , sitting before her in an unredeemed and unembarrassed thwarting of every one of the bright words that she had said to us so often . She saw us , no doubt , looking at her with the clear stare of childhood , equally without malice and without mercy , while , behind Sisley Ross , Elvy Morgum crouched in taciturn isolation , the misfit , the unwanted , who wandered alone on the fringe of our games at recess , and trailed home alone after school was out . For , in spite of Miss Farrell , she had no friends , and when the fourteenth of February arrived , and we were given permission , during the last half-hour of our school-time , to exchange the Valentineswe had bought for each other , scrawling the names that we could scarcely write on the backs of the double heart-shaped bits of paper with the printed verses inside that we could scarcely read , none was left on her desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he was the best reader in the class , to be our postman . On Sisley 's desk the bright heart-shaped folders fluttered in heaps . None of us had forgotten to send her our tributes , and half-a-dozen of the boys , with spending-money burning in their pockets and admiration burning in their hearts , had lumped the whole sum of money and adoration in one extravagant lacy token , all gilt and froth , that lay on her desk now with its sender 's name or a bashful  --  Guess Who ? ? staggering earnestly across beneath the pierced hearts and the chaste pink-ribboned cupids . We watched as Jasper , walking up and down the aisles with his big box , paused again beside Sisley 's desk and laid on it a huge red heart frilled round with stiff white paper . She turned it over without excitement , though it was the handsomest of the lot , and we watched her index finger tracing slowly the letters of the name . " It 's from Elvy Morgum , " she announced presently , a little astonishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , taciturn face , lit now with a kind of radiant terror of shyness as Sisley turned round to her , all of us wondering by what magical process a Morgum , to whom two-for-a-penny was always half-a-penny too dear , had come into possession of the most magnificent Valentine we had seen that day . But at the same moment there was a cry , sharp and clear , one almost of triumph , and we turned to see Margot Berry standing in her place across the aisle , pointing a steady finger at the great red heart on Sisley 's desk . " It 's mine , " she said . " I gave it to Sisley . I bought it for her with my own money . " She came over and picked up the Valentine and showed us the eraser marks over which Elvy had written her name . If we looked closely we could see the Margot too , violently erased but still printing the paper with the neat heavy marks of Mar-got 's signature , beneath the narrow scrawl that said Elvy Morgum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stole it out of the box at noontime and put her name on it instead of mine . I can prove it 's mine . Miss Farrell ? " We watched Miss Farrell come down the aisle and pick up the red heart and look at it , and all the while Margot 's voice went clamoring on , and Miss Farrell did not even look at her , or tell her to stop . After a while she said to Elvy , in a voice that did not sound angry to us , but full only of an amazed and tremulous desperation : " Did you take the Valentine , Elvy ? " We looked at Elvy again . She was sitting at her desk with her hands shut tight together in her lap and her head thrust forward a little , so that her dark hair fell and hid her face . She did n't say anything , and Miss Farrell asked again : " Did you take it because you wanted a pretty Valentine to give to Sisley ? Is that it , Elvy ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was mine ; I paid for it with my own money . " " Hush , " Miss Farrell said . She looked at the three of them : at Sisiey , suspended in polite waiting amazement , at Margot 's red clamorous face , at Eivy 's bunched stubborn figure crouched in her seat . " It was very wrong of you to take Margot 's Valentine , Elvy , " she said ( she was doing what the school board expected of her , I learned to understand later , standing there for morality , and the legal statutes of the state of Indiana , and the Ten Commandments themselves , all at one time ; but there was something more she wanted to stand there for too , something that said love and said mercy and said understanding , something that rose like a high hill in the sunlight , above the hidden valley of childhood in which we lived ) . " If you 'd come to me , " she said to Elvy , " I 'd have helped you make Sisley a Valentine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it together , and then it would have been yours to give to her . " She turned to us suddenly , her face pink and shining with her earnestness . " You do understand , all of you , " she said , " that Elvy only took the Valentine because shewanted something nice to give to Sisley ? She did n't take it for herself . You do understand that , do n't you ? " " She stole it , " Margot said . " She did too steal it . I 'm going to tell my father . " She looked round in clear unbending triumph at our closed and sober and approving faces . T HEN it was the day that Miss janiek lost her ring . Or it was n't that she had lost it , she said , because she knew exactly where she had put it , on the ledge of the window in the washroom when she had washed her hands ; only when she had gone back for it , it was gone , and not even a ring that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , could have learned how to walk out of a room alone . " One of those little savages took it , " she said , sitting in the big chair behind Miss Farrell 's desk on that cold March afternoon after school , her dark eyes brooding over our inadequacies as we industriously pounded erasers together out the windoW . " Yours , or mine , or poor little Collins ' down the hall , " she said . " What they 'll do with it , heaven only knows . They have n't any more idea of its value  --  which I must say is n't large , the salaries of high-school teachers in 1917 being what they were  --  than a tribe of Choctaw Indians in the year 1491 . " Miss Farrell said , " Do n't . Do n't say that . You know you do n't mean ? " She was standing behind us , looking out the window at the street below , quiet now after the long rush and chatter of the lines of children streaming from the school , lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along in an old black velveteen coat . Without looking around , we knew what sort of expression there would be in Miss Farrell 's eyes as she stood there watching Elvy Morgum disappear down the street , because as much to her as to us the tale of the lost ring must have come as a sudden whisper of sinister conjecture leading deviously to the little figure in the old black coat . I do n't know how it was that we knew , as soon as we heard the tale of the ring , as certainly as if we had been there watching the sharp profile , the pure eyes , bent over the glittering bauble on the window-ledge , look-ing at it for a long moment , in terrific indecision , before the grubby fingers , darting forth suddenly , snatched up the round of gold broken by the winking diamond-blaze , and concealed it swiftly in a faded gingham pocket , along with perhaps a half-sucked lemon drop , a rusty pen-point , and a bit of blue glass that she had picked up off the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something hidden and wicked inside us , as if we , by our absolute yet wholly groundless assurance , were somehow sharing in the darkness of Elvy 's crime . T HE next day , at recess time , Miss Farrell kept Elvy back in the classroom while the rest of us trooped outside to the sunlit schoolyard . We stood in tight clusters under the bare limbs of the two big oak trees in the north corner of the yard , our games abandoned , standing where we could watch the windows of the classroom , as if we thought that what was happening there was something lurid and violent , that would flash out its meaning to us through the blank long panes . But all that did happen was that after a little while we saw the side door of the school open and Elvy come out . She came across the yard , pausing at a few feet 's distance from us , not joining us , but staying on the fringe of things , as she had done ever since she had first come among us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What did she say to you ? " she asked . There was excitement , almost a kind of respect , in the silence with which we waited for her answer . We watched her standing there before us , her eyes going from one to the other of us as if they could not quite believe what they saw : the excitement , the respect , the fearful admiration . She took a step toward us , hesitating on the drag of her lame foot . " She did n't say anything . I was n't afraid of her , " she said . Her voice was hoarse , not loud , as if she did n't use it often and it was a little out of practice . We remembered then that we had hardly ever heard it ; even when Miss Farrell asked her a question in school , usually she only got up and stood there , silent , her head thrust forward a little , poised stubbornly like the head of a small granite idol . " Miss Janiek lost her ring , " Margot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something she was a little afraid to say . " She left it in the washroom ; she told Miss Farrell she left it there . Maybe if she does n't get it back she 'll go tell the principal . " Elvy stood there looking at us without moving ; her eyes were watching Sisley Ross , seeing the way the pink had come up in her cheeks from the excitement . " I would n't be afraid , " Elvy said . Her voice was still hoarse , but more excited and strained , the way the boys ' voices sounded when they were boasting to each other about the things they could do . " Not even if you were the one that took it ? " Margot said daringly . " Nobody ever said I took it , " Elvy said . She was answering Margot , but she seemed to be talking to Sisley all along . " I would n't be afraid , even if they did say I took it , " she said . We heard her breath coming fast between the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't be afraid , " she said . " Even if I did take it ? " Watching her , we could see the pocket of her dress bulging slightly , fancying the secret hoard inside , the half-sucked lemon drop , the rusty pen-point , and , at the bottom , hard and dangerous and bright , the round of gold and the winking diamond . Something like a sigh escaped us , a long exhalation of fearful admiration . A girl in blue held out a handful of jacks suddenly . " We 're going to play jacks , " she said to Elvy . " Do you want to play too ? You can have first turn . " She smiled at Elvy , questioningly , almost timidly , but Elvy kept on looking at Sisley Ross . " Are you going to play ? " she said to her , in that same hoarse , unbelieving voice . Sisley shook her head . " No , " she said . " I do n't think I want to play . I think I just want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute , watching Elvy , her pinkand-white face serene yet asking . " Do you think you 'd like to come , too ? " she said . We saw them go off together across the yard , side by side in the March sunlight , walking slowly , so that Elvy could keep up . They were still walking together when the bell rang and it was time for us to go back into the school again . I T Is hard to explain what happened to us after that . Such things  --  the sudden mob-shift , the peculiar fascination of the deed too dark for our own doing are always difficult to analyze , though no one who has ever thrilled to the adventures of Jesse James or Robin Hood , or has lived to see , less innocently , the pathological submission of whole peoples to the mere smell and rattle of a lawless violence , is without the knowledge of what they are like . For our own part , from the moment when , seized with the conviction that Elvy Morgum had dared things beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk away with Sisley Ross under our very eyes , we could only fall deeper into the pit of the submission which our wicked knowledge had dug for us . I remember that Elvy was wary at first , half-suspicious , it seemed , that we might suddenly take back again this strange gift of supremacy that we had thrust on her ; but as the days passed and we did nothing , her confidence grew , and she began to queen it over us with a kind of frightened taciturnity . She had grasped the fact that her ascendancy over us rested on her ability to represent to us a more violent nature than any of us owned , and she was doing her best , in her small inarticulate way , to keep up to the pitch of the character that we expected of her . Not , I suppose , that it made a great deal of difference to her whether we bowed to her or not , as long as Sisley Ross remained impressed . We used to watch the two of them , Elvy and Sisley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school ; and there were times when Miss Farrell and Miss Janiek watched them too , standing  --  as on the day that Margot and I heard them talking together  --  before the windows in our empty classroom , where they could look out over the street below . That afternoon Margot and I were pasting on the end window the Easter lilies we had cut from stiff white paper ( they were the best in the class , chosen after heated competition ) , and no doubt Miss Farrell and Miss Janiek believed that we could not hear them , for they were keeping their voices low , standing close together at the other end of the room . Miss Janiek said : " Well , she 's in the middle of it now . I thought that was what you wanted . Was n't it ? " ? and we heard Miss Farrell answer her , her voice sounding quick and unhappy , different from the way it did when she spoke to us : " But not like that . I wanted them to be her friends ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Why is n't it as good a way as any ? It 's their world ; they 've made the laws ; and they 're satisfied ? " " No , " said Miss Farrell . " It is n't the right way . It can never be the right way . " We could see her face in profile  --  the short , earnest , slightly tiptilted nose , the round chin , the curve of the forehead beneath the bright curling hair , and , behind it , the turn of Miss Janiek 's dark head on its powerful neck , the two of them together like the picture of Day and Night in our readers . " Why is n't it the right way ? " Miss Janiek said . " Is n't it the way we do things ourselves in our world , only for the thin breath of fine words that we grudge even the few moments it takes us to say ? Are you trying to make them better than we are ourselves ? " " Yes , " Miss Farrell said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding , each looking at the other to see if she understood . Then we heard Miss Janiek saying , in a low harsh voice that sounded somehow as if she had just been crying , or was just going to cry : " I do n't care ; I do n't care about any of it . I 've got my own thirty-six , and next year they 'll be Collins ' thirty-six , and the next year someone else 's ; and by the time they 're fifteen years old , if they remember me at all , they 'll remember me only as a kind of ogress who kept them in sometimes after school , and made them recite tables and learn the difference between Christopher Columbus and George Washington , when all they wanted was to be outside in the sun ? " Miss Farrell slipped her hand inside Miss Janiek 's arm . " No , " she said . " They 'll remember you . And not like that , not just the Christopher Columbus and the George Washington part ? " Miss Janiek shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You 're young ; you 're not used to losing things yet , " Then she sounded as if she were trying to laugh . " Lord , " she said , " I 've even lost my ring , my little round of golden faith , with a diamond in it to remind me that even I was once thought prized and rare . " THEY T ring , did not say that it was Elvy Morgum who had taken the ng , but we stayed secure in our wicked knowledge and our dark , resenting admiration till another afternoon , this time a dripping day late in April , when half a dozen of us , Elvy Morgum and Sisley Ross among us , had stayed behind to help decorate the classroom for May Day . We had finished the decorations , and had on rain capes and overshoes already , when someone came marching in at the open door of the classroom . It was Miss Janiek , and she was holding her left hand stretched out in front of her , looking at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there  - -  the gleaming golden circle , the bright flash of the diamond . " In a pawn shop , " she cried out , in her strong voice , to Miss Farrell . " A pawn shop , of all places in the world ! Along with the little cheap fur jackets , the loving cups , the lost treasured junk of a hundred lives ? " Miss Farrell exclaimed : " But who ? ? " She stood before Miss Janiek at the front of the room , her hands tightening on the paste-smeared chain of blue paper rings that she held . Then we all listened while Miss Janiek told the story of the ring . She told it fast , so that we did not have time to translate its meaning into the actualities of our own world as she went along ; all that we grasped was a set of wildly colored pictures , like a sequence out of one of the adventure strips in the comic papers , with a gum-chewing janitress , a detective , and a pawn-shop operator who was also a receiver of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cunning and crime . I remember how we stood there , quietly , inour rain capes and hoods , while Miss Janiek brought her story to a close , and then , half-laughing , though there were al- most tears in her eyes : " And think of my i ring in the middle of all that , " she said ; " the poor old thing that 's gone sedately up and down with me for ten years in my lone spinster existence , after its one romantic moment when Ralph set it on my finger , and I swore I 'd wear it forever ; because how was I to imagine then that it was going to make more of an actuality of a frizz-haired janitress ' dream of owning an imitation seal jacket than of my own dream of marriage and a home ? " She talked to Miss Farrell , and we kept standing there gravely , understanding and yet not understanding what was being said , with our child 's ability to take only what was comprehensible and interesting to us out of the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never heard it . Then it was Margot Berry who turned first and looked at Elvy Morgum , staring at her with her face reddening slowly with the triumph of accusation , and pointing a finger , and saying at last , clearly , as if she were damning her forever with the words : " You did n't take it . You never . You never dared . " We could hear Miss Farrell and Miss Janiek still talking , over near the desk , but we were not listening to them any more , because we were watching Elvy standing there in front of us , with her eyes going back and forth under the harsh tangle of her hair . She did n't have on a rain cape ; she had on the old black velveteen coat she always wore , and all at once , seeing her standing there in the old black coat , we wanted to make loud , boastful , cruel laughter in the quiet room  --  the ancient instinct to mock and trample the fallen leader rising in us as simply and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earliest man , before there were any words that said love and said understanding and said brotherhood . remember Elvy 's small rusty pleading voice replying to Margot ? " I never said I did . I never said I took it " ? the words dying away as her eyes went quickly from one to the other of our faces , seeing the clear unforgiving stare repeated in each . After that she did n't say anything ; she only stood there , poised on her sound leg , with her head thrust a little forward in her old attitude of unasking and unhopeful waiting . " I 'm going to walk home with Sisley , " Margot said suddenly . She looked round at us , challenging us , challenging Elvy Morgum , to dispute her right . " You can all come along , if you want . Everybody can come but Elvy Morgum . " Then ! remember how she moved toward the door , grasping Sisley 's hand tightly in her own . I can see us all as if for a moment time had stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sisley and Margot by the door , Elvy standing alone , her desperate gaze lost in the tangle of her falling hair , the rest of us just poised to move , herdlike , out the door behind Margot . I can see Miss Farrell 's startled face , the sudden leap into it of an awareness of the crisis , and Miss Janiek 's dark gaze brooding over us . And then , breaking into the silence , Sisley 's yoke , not so prompt , not so clear , a little desperate itself , butdetermined with no doll-determination , with no graceful doll-surrender to the pressed button of others ' opinion . " No , " she said . " I 'm going to walk home with Elvy Morgum . " She pulled her hand out of Margot 's and started back into the room toward Elvy . I heard Miss Janiek say something , and I turned around , and there was Miss Farrell standing beside the desk with a look on her face that I did not understand till many years later , because I thought then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that long to find out that that is the way people look when they have wanted something for a long time ( the bright words , the high hill ) , and at last someone gives it to them ungrudgingly and beautifully . " Would you like to walk home with me , Elvy ? " Sisley said . " Well , will you look at that ! " Miss Janiek said . " I 'm looking , " Miss Farrell said . " I 'm looking .
