As the eldest of nine children of poor Italian immigrants , John Deferrari was forced to quit school to help support his family . In Boston , whose North End slums were all that he knew , young John took up father Giovanni 's career . A fruit basket on his arm , he started peddling apples and oranges in the State Street financial district . <P> The sight of State Street 's prospering bankers and brokers filled him with determined envy . In rapid order , John acquired a pushcart , a store , then the building of which the store was a part . At 26 , he was operating a wholesale fruit business and a swank new shop , dealing in imported delicacies . The shop was near the Boston Public Library . Thereafter , John spent all his spare time in the library , poring over volumes on real-estate law and economics . <P> That was about all that newsmen could pin down last week when John Deferrari , now a bony , brisk bachelor of 84 , gave an amazed Boston Public Library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the presentation , he showed up in an uncomfortably new grey suit , the side pockets of which were fastened with safety pins as a protection against pickpockets . The library 's board gratefully accepted his gift and agreed to his stipulation that income from the fund be used to build a John Deferrari wing containing his portrait . <P> Like a nocturnal creature suddenly caught in the sun , Deferrari recoiled from the wave of questions that followed . When someone asked him what he ate , he replied with octogenarian bluntness : " I ask my bowels . If they need food that will go right through me , I eat fruit . If I 'm feeling good , I cook myself a steak . " <P> John always cooks his steak at his old North End family home , where he does not live but goes every evening to prepare his only meal of the day . The house is fenced in and shuttered up . When a reporter caught him at the house last week , John Deferrari gave a quick explanation of his success : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the other fellow 's business better than he does . I 'm honest too . . . . " As he talked , he sidled through the iron gate , closed it , snapped the padlock . " I 've talked too much now , " he concluded , and disappeared into the house .
