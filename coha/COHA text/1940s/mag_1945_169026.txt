As the 78th Congress flickered to a finish , lame-duck Congressmen seized their last chance . One by one , they took to the floor with prepared valedictories . Most of their colleagues had already gone home , but the Congressional Record was still there , duty-bound to print every last quack . Each swan-songster was convinced that his constituents had been misguided , but magnanimously agreed to abide by the voters ' decision . Each also wanted to take a few fast , final pokes at the Soviet Union and the British Empire . <P> Gerald Nye , 52 , giving up the Senate seat in which North Dakota voters had kept him for 19 years , admitted : " I would be lacking completely in frankness were I to say that leaving . . . is painless . . . . Knowing that this might be the last time I will speak on this floor , there has been some temptation to make this . . . an ' I told you so ' speech . . . . You see the gravity of the peril @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . I am sure , knowing the power of British propaganda , that within 20 years-perhaps within ten years-we shall be told that we must go into another European war to keep Russia from seizing control of the world . . . . " <P> Hamilton Fish , Congressman from New York for almost a quarter-century , wriggled his beetling black brows and thundered : " I had hoped to be Chairman Of the Rules Committee . . . . I am opposed to Naziism . . . but there is one thing worse-and that is the bloody hand of Communism . . . . It took most of the New Deal Administration , half of Moscow , $400,000 , and Governor Dewey to defeat me . . . . " <P> Robert ( " Buncombe Bob " ) Reynolds , 60 , delivered his swan song looking jaunty and well-preserved in a loud-checked shirt and playboy bow tie . North Carolina 's junior Senator , now the son-in-law of Washington 's wealthy Mrs. Evalyn Walsh McLean , had decided last spring not to seek a fourth term . Said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an isolationist . . . . I merely employed the term because those who attempted to smear us for trying to keep this country out of the war used that word . . . . We are winning this war . . . . Russia could not have won it . Great Britain could not have won it . . . . " <P> Stephen A. Day , Illinois ' billiard-bald congressional spokesman for the Chicago Tribune for four years , explained : " We are wasting time when we expect Stalin to accept a plan of collective security . . . . Whoever heard of a dictator sharing his sovereignty ? . . . Now for the real reason why I have been an object of attack by the President and his entire battery of New Dealers , character assassins and Communists . For many years , I have been an outspoken foe of Communism . . . . "
