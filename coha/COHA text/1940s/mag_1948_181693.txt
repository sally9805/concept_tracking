Into Rio 's Palacio Tiradentes one afternoon this week strode well-groomed Professor Pereira Lira , President Eurico Gaspar Dutra 's personal counselor . He carried a heavy , leather-bound pile of papers , which he placed on the speaker 's desk in the Chamber of Deputies . To the opening session of the Brazilian Congress the president had sent a 130,000-word message on the state of the nation . <P> Ex-soldier Dutra , the honest plodder who had faced one crisis after another in three uneasy years as president , gave a good account of himself . He had balanced the 1947 budget and had $25 million left over ( he was $141 million in the red in 1946 ) . Moreover , Brazil 's inflation-one of the worst in South America-now seemed to have leveled off . <P> Courageously turning a deaf ear to rabid nationalists , and ignoring the outlawed Communists who cry out against Yankee imperialism , he pointed to the need for U.S. dollars to put Brazil 's economic machine in high gear . He wanted laws that would open up the country to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil . Under Brazil 's jungle , oilmen hope to find petroleum pools that will make the Western democracies less dependent on the strategically vulnerable Middle East . Brazilians , who last year spent $85 million on imported gasoline and fuel oil , are just as anxious to see the fields brought in . Though they lack the money to do their own proving , they have blocked exploration by foreigners . <P> In Rio , the oil diplomats of Jersey Standard , Shell and Texaco were anxiously waiting for Congress to write a law that would give them a freer hand in production , refining and distribution . Always before , the government had felt that Brazilians should control sales in Brazil . Now , with Dutra looking their way , the companies might get a law to their liking .
