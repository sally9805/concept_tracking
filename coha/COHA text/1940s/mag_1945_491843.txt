. By COMDR . C. E. DICKINSON , U.S.N. With BOYDEN SPARKES S WERE sixteen CVE escort carriers ; I was air officer on one of the sixteen , the Ommaney Bay . Under 7th Fleet command , we had been stationed just off the coast of Samar Island , so that our squadrons of planes and pilots could support the operations proceeding in Leyte Gulf and on the island of Leyte . It was twenty minutes to three on the morning of October twenty-fifth when I was aroused by our communications officer , Lieut . W. S. Stewart . He had just intercepted messages from the 7th Fleet , more than 100 miles to the south . It had engaged a strong Jap anese surface force trying to sneak through Surigao Strait into the Leyte Gulf . A furious battle was on . I jumped into my clothes . As I stepped out of my cabin up in the " island , " I encountered Comdr . Dean Black , the executive officer , who had dressed in similar haste . We went to the cabin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us conferred . Then we three went into Air Plot , and there , in the middle of the night , broke out the map . The Jap central force , we knew , while proceeding toward San Bernardino Strait the day before , had been attacked by planes from Vice Admiral Mitscher 's fast carrier task force . We knew that several Jap ships were damaged and that by three o'clock in the afternoon the Japanese force had turned back . However , for two reasons we had not believed they were retiring permanently . First , our reports on the Jap southern force showed them still proceeding toward Surigao Strait : it was unlikely that the smaller southern force would come on if this bigger one was permanently retiring . Second , although several ships had been damaged end possibly one cruiser sunk , we believed that the Japanese admiral must have reconciled himself in advance to taking some losses in order to get through those restricted waters . On that basin , we on the Ornmaney Bay supposed San Bernardino Strait was being guarded precisely as Surigao Strait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern Japanese force was all the power of Admiral Halsey 's 3rd Fleet . We did n't worry at all about anything coming at us from that direction . As we focused our attention on that map in Air Plot , we felt sure that what was now developing was certainly going to require the use of torpedoes by our planes . So we alerted the whole air department . I broke out the **26;2191;TOOLONG officer , Lieut . Ira Hall , who rushed away to supervise the loading of " fish " into the torpedo planes on the hangar deck and to break out the big bombs we also use against heavy ships . As soon as I was free , I went down the ladders to the hangar deck , and found it already alive and bustling as a disturbed anthill . Even though escort carriers are called " baby " carriers , they are only relatively small . The hangar deck of each is an immense chamber , as long as a city block , almost seventy feet wide and with thirty feet of space between the steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For blackout purposes , the ports and hatches were tightly closed . The place was hot and humid . Every man there streamed sweat as he worked . I passed some fuse men , each walking as gingerly as if he carried a baby newly born . The high priest of the torpedoes was a man named Porter , an aviation chief torpedoman . He had served on big carriers and his record was full of citations and commendations . Just for the satisfaction of hearing his reply , I asked Porter several times if his " flab " were ready . " Every one ready to go , sir , " he answered each time , and somehow his sureness made me feel stronger . A torpedo is a weapon of tremendous blasting power . Its great value is that it lets water into a ship , whereas even a heavy bomb ordinarily lets in only air , however much it messes up the enemy . No ship afloat can stand up against a succession of torpedo hits . A large carrier usually carries perhaps five times as many as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's responsibility . He had taken charge of the crew preparing to load one plane , and Greene , another aviation torpedoman , was directing a crew working on a second . While I stood there , the first torpedo was trundled forward on its specially designed dolly truck . I saw them carefully maneuver the dolly under the plane and get the torpedo directly beneath the bomb bay . Ten dungareed legs were all I could see of men working inside on the bracing . After the torpedo had been hoisted out of sight , one by one the straps dropped off , and I knew that plane was finally and truly loaded . Ours was by no means the only hangar deck abustle in the middle of that night . To the south of us were four CVE 's with destroyers and destroyer escorts , under Rear Admiral Tom L. Sprague , who was also in command of our whole light task force . In our own task group , under Rear Admiral Felix Stump , were six CVE 's , three destroyers and four destroyer escorts . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CVE 's , with destroyers and destroyer escorts  --  under Rear Admiral C. A. F. Sprague , who is no relation to the other Sprague . Lieut . Allen W.

" Snuffy thoroughly knew his job , and now this job was to search out and bomb any cripples left from the night action between Vice Admiral Kinkaid and the Japanese southern force . At 6:58 A.M. , when Snuffy and the other search planes were launched , we all supposed they were setting off on the day 's prize mission . But while those planes were still circling , waiting for the last of the fighters to be launched , we heard a distant reverberation . Somewhere beyond the horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we recognized dispelled all uncertainty . The voice came to us through the radio speaker there on the bridge . It was the voice of Admiral C. A. F. Sprague , in command of the north group , and he was speaking primarily to Admiral Tom Sprague south of us . " We have enemy fleet consisting of battleships and cruisers fifteen miles astern of us  --  closing . We are being fired on . " Captain Young crossed to Fly Control , port side of the bridge , where I was talking to Commander Black . We were all dumfounded . Through the night we had believed arrangements had been made to plug San Bernardino Strait , which was north of our task force . We had had no word about these Japanese ships corn-ing through the strait until we heard the gunfire , followed by Admiral Sprague 's report . We knew there were twenty-five or twenty-six ships in that central Jap force . It had been repeatedly counted by our fliers and repeatedly found to be about that number ; four or five battleships , about eight cruisers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as ready as we could make her . For six months we had carried about ten extra planes aboard . Our complement of mechanics had not been increased , yet had managed to give each plane its regular sixty-hour checkup . Our planes were ready . Guns were ready . Bombs were ready . Torpedoes were ready . Through another intercepted message , we learned very soon that Admiral Torn Sprague was requesting permission to launch all torpedo planes . This meant " all " from the sixteen carriers . From the Commander Support Aircraft on Vice Admiral Kinkaid 's flagship , then probably in the vicinity of Surigao Strait to the south , permission was granted with emphasis . At once , our Adthiral Stump called the six escort carriers of our group , and directed us to prepare to launch torpedo planes . He asked a question that immediately assumed tremendous significance : How many could we launch ? Of the remaining torpedo planes still aboard the Ommaney Bay , two were now loaded with torpedoes ; two more were being loaded , and loading is a slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the multiplicity of crews and facilities that larger carriers have . We could load no more than a few torpedo planes at a time . The Japs knew our position . During the preceding days and on this very morning lone scouting planes of theirs had appeared and disappeared , staying just long enough to spot us . The Ommaney Bay and the Kadashan Bay were slower than the other carriers of our group . Our ship 's bottom , unscraped since she was launched almost a year before , was fouled with barnacles . Our best speed , then , was not up to par , whereas our pursuers were coming on at twenty-seven or twenty-eight knots . Our torpedo planes , once in the air , would be as deadly as the best , but we had to live through an interval of futility when all we could do was wait while skillful men below did their utmost in the face of physical limitations . The northernmost group now listed the Jap force closing in on it as four enemy battleships , eight cruisers and other previously identified ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the order for the de-strayers and destroyer escorts to attack the Jap battleships . The voice reports we intercepted were always calm , even when the Destroyer Escort Roberts , as she charged in , was seen to be hit , and then to disintegrate in fire and smoke . It was then the Destroyer Heerman and the Destroyer Escort Dennis both were hit . Captain Young , at 7:37 , called the admiral and said , " We are ready to launch planes . " We were in an open formation , Providentially , there had been a change in the weather . In the preceding day , there had been scarcely any wind , but now it had strengthened . It had a force during the battle of twelve to seventeen knots . Otherwise we would have had difficulty in launching our heavily loaded torpedo planes or surely land them back aboard . At 7:45 , our six carriers turned toward our still unseen pursuers and started launching torpedo planes and fighters . Necessarily , we were losing distance to our pursuers during that launching , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant the last plane was in the air , our carrier group again turned away from the wind and away from the enemy . It was just about then that our radio once more intercepted the voice of Admiral C. A. F , Sprague giving some dismaying information . " We have been straddled for the last half hour , " he said ; adding , " The Japanese shooting is very poor , " Abeam and astern of him , several Jap heavy cruisers and battleships steadily were crawling up . Bogeys were bothering us at this time . In the fleet , for enemy plane we say " bogey . " Any time we saw a bogey , it meant that the Japanese fleet , in effect , was seeing us . We realized that Admiral Stump knew they were close to our own horizon when he ordered the three destroyers of our task group to take a position in column about five miles to our rear . They were further ordered to be ready to attack any light enemy forces , such as destroyers , which might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that , of the twenty-six Jap ships , only a portion were needed to deal with our northern group . The rest surely were steaming south toward us , even while we were getting radio reports of what was happening to the Gambier Bay of the northern group , She had been hit . One of her engines had stopped , so that she rapidly went astern of the rest of her group . We were striving to keep our barnacle-encrusted hull up with the other ships of our own task group . Each of our ships was marking on that green water a long white wake . Suddenly , near one of the destroyers to our rear , I saw a cluster of huge spurts rising from the gen . They were shell splashes . The salvo had fallen in a rippling line , " Look ! " said Dean Black . He pointed astern . Back there , seeming to rise out of the horizon , was a stiff wraith of smoke . Almost at once we distinguitthed two other , lesser smoke marks against the overcast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy ship furiously burning oil trying to get us within range . We were the tail-end escort carrier on the right side of the formation , closest to the enemy and probably within the space of minutes fated to become one of the choicest targets . Our initial strike had been in the air about an hour , when our six escort carriers launched more torpedo planes and more fighters . A part of the initial strike had gone to attack the Japs . But some remained , and these , now strongly reinforced by the second strike , got into formation and became our No. 1 ? iope for staying afloat and alive . We needed excuse for hope . Some of the enemy ships already had passed our northern group and were closing in on us . Three times that morning , it should be remembered , we had changed our course to go into the wind . Three times , then , we had shortened the distance separating these two carrier groups . By the time we were ready to turn out of the wind after launching that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes to nine , and that was about the time the mast of the foremost of our pursuers ap . peered above the horizon . Then quickly there came into view the masts of a second and a third enemy warship . Now our destroyers received an order to close up , to get as far out of range as they could , consistent with their job of protecting us . They were within two or three miles of us on our port aide . Then , close to the destroyers , there came an even more astonishing eruption out of the sea , this time of yellow and green geysers . These gigantic splashes towered 200 feet or more . We understood this curious spectacle . There was fast-staining dyestuff in the noses of those big Japanese shells , designed to identify each one as coming from a particular turret , to aid spotting work . We could tell that the Japs were shooting at us  --  not merely their cruisers ' 8-inch guns but big 14- inchere of the Kongo-class battleship . Another salvo struck . This time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea , they curtained the hindmost destroyer . I would have given anything to see the long bow of the U.S.S. New Jersey coming up over our horizon . Word came that the group to the south was under heavy air attack and needed our help . It had sustained damage which had temporarily reduced its power to launch and recover planes . Many of its planes had been obliged to fly to our newly won airfields on Leyte . There they could be refueled and resupplied with ammunition for further fighting . But without these planes , those four carrier , ' under Admiral Tom Sprague at times were wide open to air attack , and there cameEI time when enemy planes were attacking them almost at will without their being able to put up fighter opposition . Su it was necessary to send come fighters from our group to help Admiral Sprague 's available fighters clear the air of enemy planes . After our torpedo planes had vanished north , the suspense was almost unbearable . We were getting information that left us scarcely any excuse to hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking , and we likewise seemed doomed to certain destruction unless our torpedo planes did their stuff . Over the radio , we were learning that the Jap ships had now moved into such short range that the five surviving carriers of the northern group each had brought her lone 5-inch gun into action . The northern action was at that heat when , out of the overcast , torpedo planes from our group came swooping down . Each of the heavy cruisers got a torpedo in its belly ; all three were damaged . The cruisers then made one last attempt against Admiral C. A. F. Sprague 's force . They themselves and their destroyers fired a salvo of torpedoes  --  a futile salvo , which ran short , never reaching the carriers . It was then that the enemy abruptly turned away and fled to the north . However , just before the Japs were swinging about , two of Admiral C. A. F. Sprague 's destroyers , the Hoel and the Johnston , were hit by enemy fire . As they were not seen again , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moreover , had not seen the last of the Japanese that day . Later , its ships were under heavy air attack by land-based bombers . Several of these planes concentrated on the St. Ln . This escort carrier , which had withstood the action of cruisers , caught on fire and , after a series of explosions , sank . All the while this action was going on out of our sight , our attention to exciting details of it coming over the radio was being diverted at intervals of three or four minutes by those shells from our own relentless pursuers . The salvos kept striking closer . All our planes were in the air . How could we possibly recover , load and launch another torpedo strike in time to save ourselves , should this one fail ? Astern of us about a mile , the sea again had cast up eight green and yellow geysers . At the same time we got the first report from the planes sent to deal with those who were chasing and shooting at us . " Torpedo attack completed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Japs seemed No loathsome to us as in the next few seconds . Then wonderful news was intercepted , and swiftly our despair was transformed  --  two of the three ships chasing us were seen to be slowing down . So there had been hits , after all ; one target was a heavy cruiser and the other n Tone-class cruiser . The corrected report told us that one had certainly been hit by two torpedoes . This gave us enormous relief and satisfaction . Almost immediately , we got further word . The two cruisers were stopped , dead in the water . But the Japanese battleship , as if to show us she was not slowing down , right then plunged another salvo astern of us and a little closer than before . That salvo sobered us again . Before the shell splashes had quite subsided , we saw our planes returning fur fresh ammunition and fuel , and we knew we were , for the time being , at least , helpless to defend ourselves from that pursuing monster . Torpedoes gone , our planes were stringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POST January 27,1945 swooping on it . launched their rockets , getting four to five hits . The destroyer simply disi itegrated in a terrific explosion . Another Jap destroyer sank after rockets had made holes in it below the line . Much has appeared in print as to why that powerful Japanese central force turned away from us when they had us in a precarious situation . In my opinion , they did it simply because they found themselves taking losses out of all proportion to the damage they were dishing out . By staying , the Jape could have sunk a lot of our escort carriers . But they must have known our escort carriers could be replaced easily , whereas they knew they were in no position to replace their own enormous battleships and heavy cruisers , the building of which consumes months , even in America .
