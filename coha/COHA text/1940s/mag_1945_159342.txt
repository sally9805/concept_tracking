The clamor to bring the boys home grew louder &; louder . Millions complained that demobilization was a scandal . <P> Complaints , based on letters from the boys , recited old grievances . High-point men had been left to languish at overseas ports . Conditions in waiting areas were sometimes deplorable . The elaborate de mobilization machinery was falling apart . <P> No Trains , No Planes . There were new things to talk about . In San Francisco , a ship that had recently been carrying G.I.s sailed for Argentina with a load of pleasure-bound passengers and commercial cargo . Overtaxed transportation facilities in the U.S. had become a bottleneck . Forty-six Army nurses arrived in San Antonio after a harrowing three-day trip on a troop train from California , sharing two chair cars with G.I.s . One day 's food ration was a piece of bread and jelly and a small portion of stew . Half the time their cars had no water . ( " Our washroom simply stank . " ) But at least they got home . In West Coast ports , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so bad many of them had to be quartered in barracks ships in Puget Sound . There would be many disappointments on Christmas . <P> " No Boats , No Votes . " Although they were doing their best , the Army and Navy knew that the clamor could not be calmed . Some servicemen overseas were almost psychopathic in their anxiety to get home . Without themselves aboard , the departure of any ship for home seemed out of order . In the Pacific , their resentment found form in a slogan which was stamped on all U.S.-bound mail : " No Boats , No Votes . " <P> At home , the uproar was augmented by understandably yearning relatives , and by others of more distant and dubious kin ship . The leftist National Maritime Union called a nationwide one-day strike to dramatize a pious demand for more troop ships . The Communist Daily Worker , in a front-page editorial , explained that the strike was called " in the name of the American people to get G.I. Joe home and prevent his use in imperialist intervention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the most important facts in the demobilization program were drowned out . Since V-E day nearly four million servicemen have been brought back from overseas . December arrivals will swell the total by another million . After World War I , it took the nation a year and a half to bring back almost 2,000,000 troops from Europe . This time they are being brought back from all over the world . <P> By Jan. 1 , the number of troops in Europe eligible for return will be reduced to about 200,000 . To speed up returns from the Pacific Theater , the Army last week transferred 32 transports ( total capacity : 83,000 men ) from the Atlantic . By June 1 , the Army promised , the Army will be transporting and discharging G.I.s in every theater just as fast as they become eligible .
