txt Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel asserted today he was " misled " by a prewar warning into be . lieving that the Navy Department thought no attack on Pearl Harbor was " imminent or probable . " A crowd of 200 spectators gathered as the former Pacific Fleet commander appeared before a Senate-House committee to tell publicly for the first time his story of the disastrous Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor Dec. 7 , 1941 . Attired in a dark suit with a bright blue tie , the retired naval officer began reading a 25,000-word statement in which he asserted that Washington officials had denied him information he said might have made Pearl Harbor an ambush for the Japanese . Reading in a strong voice , Admiral Kimmel contended before the committee : Data Held Back 1 . He was not supplied in. formation available in - Washington from intercepted messages which , he argued , " told when and where Japan would probably strike . " 2 . That , withholding This information , ' the Navy should have instructed him specifically to " be on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he had had Washington 's knowledge of intercented Japanese messages , he would have considered revising war plans to Provide " an opportunity to ambush the Japanese striking force as it ventured to Hawaii . " 4 . Orders he received the same day he got the Nov. 27 " war warning " message to transogrrt Army planes and troops to Midway and Wake . " indicated that Washington did not consider an air raid on Pearl Harbor either imminent or probable . " Reconnaissance Plan 5 . The War and Navy Departments knew that long-range reconnaissance* from Oandt was to be flown " only when a carrier strike against the islands was probable within narrow time limits . " 6 . He would have ordered the fleet to sea if he had known what Washington knew , on successive dates from Nov. 27 to Dec. 7 , but without this information he kept his battleships in harbor where he Thought them safer against air at , tack than at sea without carrier support . Admiral Kimmel 's testimony placed him in direct opposition to much that the committee heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jan. 5 until today . Admiral Stark said he con- sidered the " war warning " message amply sufficient to alert the fleet to a war basis . When Admiral Kimmel 's testi- , . mony is completed , possibly late ' this week , Maj. Gen. Walter C. Short , Hawaiian Army command-er at the time of the attack , is expected to follow him to the stand . I Admiral Kimmel told the committee in his statement that " no reasonable man " could have been ! expected to consider that Admiral Stark 's Nov. 27 " war warning " message " was intended to suggest the likelihood of an attack in the Hawaiian area . " Asia Blow Hinted The message said diplomatic negotiations had ceased and " an aggressive move by Japan is expected within the next few days . " It said there were indications of " an amphibious expedition against ! either the Philippines , Thai , or Kra I peninsula , or possibly Borneo , " advising Admiral Kimmel to " exe-cute an appropriate defensive de- 1 employment . . This did not warn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ad- , miral Kimmel said , adding : " It did not state expressly or by ? implication that an attack on the ! Hawaiian area was imminent or probable . It did not repeal or mod- , ify the advice previously given me I by the Navy Department that no I move against Pearl Harbor was imminent or planned by Japan . The phrase ' war warning ' can not , be made a catchall for all the con- 1 tingencies hindsight may suggest . " The information he continued to get from various sources up through Dec. 6 all pointed at a Japanese strike in Southeast Asia , ' Admiral Kimmel said . He added that the information ' on Dec. 3 that Japanese consuls , had been ordered to destroy most of their codes meant to him that ! the Japanese were taking precau- I tions in case the United States and Great Britain declared war be-cause of Japanese attacks in Southeast Asia . Not Unusual He also contended it was not unusual that radio calls of Japanese carriers were not identified after Dec. 1 . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times in periods ranging from nine to 22 days there was no radio trace of the Japanese carriers . Admiral Kimmel recalled that Admiral Stark had written him Oct. 17 saying that " personally I do not believe the Japanese are going to sail into us , and the message I sent you merely stated the possibility . " Admiral Kimmel said it was his conviction that it he had known by Nov. 28 everything known by the Navy Department in Washington , he would not have sent carriers to Wake and Midway to deliver planes . " I would have gone to sea with the fleet and endeavored to keep it in an intercepting position at sea , " he said . Even early in the morning of Dec. 7 , he said that if he had received the " significant information " the Navy Department had , he would have moved all light forces out of Pearl Harbor and put the remainder on a " general quarters " battle-readiness alert . " It is my conviction that action by the Navy Department at any one of these significant dates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have altered the events of Dec. 7 , 1941 , " he testified . Few Planes Available On the important question of ! why he did n't have scouting planes searching the ocean around Pearl I Harbor , Admiral Kimmel told the committee that he had been instructed to get the fleet ready for war and could n't afford to wear out his planes and crews on a partial reconnaissance . He had only 49 flyable patrol planes available on Oahu , without spare parts or spare crews , at the time of the attack , he said . Proper reconnaissance , he claimed , would have required a pool of 250 planes for protracted operations . Admiral Kimmel said that the " roar warning " message had told him to get ready to carry out War ! Plan 46 . Under that , he said , he had to keep his planes in readi , tress to carry out raids on the Japanese-held Marshall Islands . He disclosed that , in the week ; preceding the attack . patrol planes from Oahu had scouted a sector I north and northwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday . and Thursday . The I Japanese came in from the north on Sunday , I Admiral Kimmel said he kept the battleships in Pearl Harbor because it would have been " a ; dangerous course " to send his battleships to sea without the air cover provided by carriers . By keeping the battleships in the harI bor , he said he gave them protect lion from land antiaircraft guns ' they would have lacked at sea . Depth-Bomb Instructions After he got the " war warning " message , Admiral Kimmel said he instructed the fleet to depth bomb all foreign submarines they encountered in their operating areas . He had been instructed previously , he said , not to borne submarines except within the three-mile limit of American territory . Admiral Kimmel told of several unverified reports after Nov. 28 of the presence of Japanese submarines . Then came the report from the destroyer Ward on the morning of Dec. 7 that it had depth-charged a submarine near the harbor . He got the information of the Ward 's report about 7:30 a. m. , Admiral Kimmel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirm the reported contact . " I was waiting such verification at the time of the attack , " he said . " In my judgment , the effort to obtain confirmation of the reported submarine attack off Pearl Harbor was a proper preliminary to more drastic action In view of the number of such contacts which had not been verified in the past . " Admiral Kimmel toil the committee that he never was informed of the decision other witnesses have said was made in August . 1941. to discontinue sending Army and Navy field commanders the full information obtained by intercepting Japanese messages . In July , Admiral Kimmel said , he had received the verbatim text of at least seven messages . " I had asked for all vital infor- mation . I had been assured that I would have it . I appeared to be receiving it . My current estimate of the situation was formed on this basis . " Yet , in fact , the most vital information from the intercepted Japanese messages was not sent to me . This failure not only deprived me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al Kimmel said he was not sutplied with any information on a message intercepted Oct. 9 showing that Tokyo had divided Pearl Harbor into five subareas and was seeking details about the berthing of ships of the fleet in those areas , Admiral Kimmel maintained this was significant , for " no other harbor or base in American territory was divided into subareas by Japan . " He summed up the intercepted Japanese diplomatic dispatches as showing that after Nov. 29 , " a Japanese plan of action automatically went into effect ; that the plan was of such importance that it involved the fate of the empire ; and that Japan urgently wanted the United States to believe that negotiations were continuing after the deadline date to prevent suspicion as to the nature of the plan . " Claims Messages withheld Admiral Kimmel said that these messages , taken together with those seeking information about Hawaii , " pointed to Pearl Harbor as a probable objective " of attack . But he did n't know about the messages and thus was denied the right to make his own deductions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first 13 liana- of the final diplomatic reply , received in Washington Dec. 6. would have meant only one thing to him  --  that the Japanese felt " war with the United States was imminent . " " Not a word of these supremely critical developments of Saturday , Dec. 6 , was sent to me . " Admiral Kimmel reminded the committee . He noted that the dispatch fixing the hour for the delivery of the Japanese reply to the United States at 1 p. m. , Washington time , was intercepted and decoded by the Navy Department on the morning of Dec. 7 at 7 a. in. , Washington time . 1:30 a. m. , Hawaiian time ? " nearly 6,2 hours before the attack : ' " The translation of this abort message from the Japanese Was a two-minute job . " he said . " Not later than 10:30 a. m. the Chief of Naval Operations was informed of it . ' this information was not supplied to me prior to the attack . " Torpedo Attack Admiral Kimmel said that technical information he received trom Admiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a successful airplane torpedo attack in Pearl Harbor was negligible . " Witnesses have testified that torpedoes launched by the Japanese planes in the 30- to 40-foot-deep harbor , which supposedly was too shallow for their use , did more damage to ships than bombs . Admiral Kimmel noted that the Secretary of the Navy hart said that naval officials knew that torpedoes had been launched successfully in 42 feet of water in 1940. but added : " Such information was never supplied me . " Admiral Kimmel said in his statement that his appointment as Commander in Chief of the Fleet came as a " complete surprise " to him . tWhen he saw President Roosevelt in June , 1941 , six months after his appointment , it was the first time he had any conversation or communication with Mr. Roosevelt since 1918 , the Admiral said . " My appointment was in no wise contingent upon any ecquiesccnce on my part in a decision already made months before to keep the fleet in Hawaiian waters. , " he declared . Fleet Limitations When he took command . Admiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was inferior to the Japanese in every category of fighting ships . " " No one in authority expected the Pacific Fleet to meet the Japanese head on . " he declared . With the Navy Department haeing decided in August , 1941. that he and other field commanders should not receive all of tire information in the intercepts , Admiral Kimmel said the Nary should have taken other steps . " Another course of action then remained . " he Said . - That was to issue an order which would have directed dispositions of the fleet to guard . against an attack on Hawaii . " When he got Admiral Stark 's Oct. 16 , 1941 , message telling of the fall of the Japanese Cabinet and suggesting that he take " preparatory deployment , " Admiral Kimmel said he took immediate action . Sub Patrol Ordered " I ordered submarines to assume a war patrol off both Wake and Midway , " he recounted . " I reinforced Johnston and Wake with ? additional marines , ammunition , and stores and also sent addition ! at marines to Palmyra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District to direct ; an alert status in the outlying islands . He did so and reported I his action to me . " I placed on 12 hours ' notice certain vessels of the fleet which were in West Coast ports , held I six submarines in readiness to de ' part for Japan , delayed the sailing I of one battleship which was scheduled to visit a West Coast navy I yard . I dispatched 12 patrol planes to Midway with orders to carry out daily patrols within 100 miles of the island , and placed in effect additional security measures in the fleet operating areas . " Discussing another Hawaii 's preparedness Admiral Kimmel said : " The local defense plan against air attack , submitted to the War and Navy Departments , clearly provided that effective distant air ( reconnaissance from Oahu could not be made as a routine it . ter . I " It wai only to be instituted when there was information from other sources that a carrier strike against the islands was probable within narrow time limits . This was a makeshift plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " Had I directed their use for intensive distant searches from Oahu , I faced the peril of having those planes grounded when the fleet needed them and when the war plan was executed .
