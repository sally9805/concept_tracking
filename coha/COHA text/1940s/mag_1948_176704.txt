Rain turned Tanforan 's racing strip into thick , black gumbo . But it takes more than gumbo to stop Citation , a wonder horse in all weathers . Last week , in his first West Coast race , Citation sloshed effortlessly down the stretch to win his tune-up for next week 's $50,000 Tanforan Handicap . His time was 1:12 , one second off the six furlong track record . Explained Jockey Eddie Arcaro : " I did n't want to hurry him any . " <P> Out of sight at Tanforan ( in his stall ) but not out of mind was Shannon II-a horse close to the heart of every California race fan . Next to Citation , he is probably the fastest horse in the world today . Shannon is a seven-year-old bay stallion , Australian by birth and friendly as an overgrown puppy . Unlike Citation , everything about him is controversial-even his pedigree . <P> Once Upon a Time . Most Shannon stories have at least two versions . One that makes the best telling opens on a stormy night in 1826 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sydney harbor . On board were some English racing mares bound for Australia , and at least one managed to swim ashore . Her pedigree papers went down with the ship . So the name of <P> Spaewife was pinned to the mare , and eventually she was bred to an Australian stallion . Six years ago , a weedy yearling-reportedly one of her descendants-was led into an auction ring and knocked down for 400 . That was how Peter Riddle , a veteran Australian horseman , came by Shannon . <P> Shannon 's fame spread the length &; breadth of the Antipodes . In New South Wales one day , Shannon ran a mile in i : 34-a feat more impressive than the world record of 1:34 ! set by Equipoise at Arlington Park in 1932 . In Australia , horses are timed from a standing start , whereas U.S. horses get a five-or six-jump run at the starting pole . The greatest race Shannon ever ran , he lost . That day , he got left at the post by 60 yards and then put on a magnificent charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his poor start , horsemen estimate that he ran the mile in 1:33 . <P> High weights he had to carry and high taxes his owner had to pay ( as much as 80% of the purses ) cut Shannon down to three or four select races a year . Riddle became so fond of him that he turned down offer after offer for the horse . Last year , after Peter Riddle 's death , all Australia listened in by radio as Shannon was once again led into the auction ring . <P> The first bid was 15,000 guineas ( $51,000 ) . According to legend , a tipsy hack driver , without a quarter in his pocket , kept raising the bidding until it reached $100,000 . Actually , 75 seconds after the bidding opened , Australian Industrialist W. J. Smith got the horse for about $88,000 . Two months later , Shannon headed for fabled California , where $100,000 purses grow on bushes .
