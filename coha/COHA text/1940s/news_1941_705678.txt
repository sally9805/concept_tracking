txt On the Exercise of Humanity To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your paper prints a letter from Luigi Criscuolo commenting upon our State Department 's plan to deport employes of the German and Italian consulates . In part it states : " I believe that the government ; while taking a realistic stand on these ex-employes of the Italian Government , should exercise a little humanity toward thosd persons who have shown by their conduct that they would be a credit to our citizenship . " Permit me to quote the edict just promulgated by the Italian Government and carried in today 's news dispatch from Rome : " Jews who have not been . Aryanized will be expelled from Italy . In the interim they must wear white distinguishing marks and will be excluded from parks , theatres , cinemas and hospitals , and will not be allowed to use radios or telephones or to hire servants . " Does Mr. Criscuolo believe that the exercise of a " little humanity " should be confined to these United States ? G. WILLIAMS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
