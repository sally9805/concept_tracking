Where Were the Jap Planes ? <P> There were signs of victory - U.S. victory - in the reports from bombed Japan . They were signs that Japan 's air strength is waning . In Japan and elsewhere , there were even signs that Japan never did have the kind of air strength which she must have for final victory . <P> Not Enough " Zeros ? " If the U.S. , in daylight , lost only nine of 60 planes - as the Japs once reported - something was seriously wrong with Japan 's air defenses . If the U.S. raiders lost only two or three - as the Japs first reported - Japan has no air defenses to speak of . Whatever the true figure , Tokyo evidently had few fighters at home to shield herself . <P> This indication bore out one of the most significant trends of the Pacific war . Japan seems to be running out of her best fighters , the Navy " Zeros , " which must be the spearheads of her defense against air attack . Last week the A.V.G. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. fighter-pilots had destroyed more than 200 Jap pursuits . The Zeros are fast-climbing , highly maneuverable , highly powered ( 1,675-h.p. ) single-seaters . And even the Zeros , despite their superior maneuverability , have been no match for the faster , Allison-engined P-40s and their superior U.S. pilots . Lieut . General George H. Brett , the United Nations air commander in Australia , reported that United Nations airmen were destroying six Jap planes for every Allied plane lost in that area . <P> Can Japan Keep It Up ? When Japan began her Pacific march , she had perhaps 5,000 combat planes of all types , ages , conditions . She had no " Japanese Air Force " ; she had two air services , completely integrated in the Army and Navy . Enthusiasts like Major Alexander de Seversky ( see p. 52 ) would say in fact that Japan had no real air power ; like the U.S. , she had only air auxiliaries . <P> Some 2,500 of Japan 's planes were " first-line " combat craft , and many of these 2,500 were technically inferior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were mostly slow , ancient , underpowered , underarmed crates , some of which did not even have retractable landing gear ( see cut ) . Furthermore , Japan has had very heavy losses - some 1,100 planes , undoubtedly including a high proportion of her best . <P> Nevertheless , Japan today probably has more planes - in over-all total - than she had in December . Reason : high though Jap losses have been to date , they are still slightly less than Japan 's probable rate of aircraft production . Last autumn she was reportedly building about 300 combat planes per month , was aiming at 600 per month by the end of this year . But overall totals , even over-all replacements , are not what count in the kind of war Japan faces . What counts is whether her production is geared to replace the types which she is losing , as fast as she is losing them - and she is losing fighters , may be losing even her best bombers , at a rate higher than any she probably expected .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
