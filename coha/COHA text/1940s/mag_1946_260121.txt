The college football market was wide open again . West Point and Annapolis no longer had their wartime corner on talent . Back to Mississippi State went Army 's Shorty McWilliams , back to Notre Dame went Navy 's Bob Kelly , back to Penn went Navy 's Tony Minisi ( TIME , Sept. 9 ) . Last week the authorities of the service academies , who had viewed the trend with dignified alarm , got support from a high quarter , Harry Truman 's military aide . <P> Said Major General Harry Vaughan ( no West Pointer but a 1916 All-Missouri center at Westminster College ) : " I got a lot of letters from some proud mamas who wanted to know why their Johnny was being drafted and these football players were not . . . . My reply was . . . that they certainly look like draft dodgers . . . . They have spent two or three years being educated at Government expense at the academies ; now , when the shooting is over , they resign . . . . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drafted this fall . Kelly , having served 22 months as a gob before he went to Annapolis , is exempt . So are McWilliams and Arkansas ' Clyde Scott ( ex-Annapolis ) - thanks to being enrolled in advanced R.O.T.C. Most vulnerable : Penn 's Minisi . <P> Last week Minisi told why he quit Annapolis : " I was n't going to follow a Navy career . I do n't think it would have been right to get my college education at the Government 's expense . " Mississippi State Coach Allyn McKeen had an equally ingratiating explanation of McWilliams ' decision to leave West Point : " He found it unpleasant there . He did n't like the discipline . "
