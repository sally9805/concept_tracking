Of all her snakes , 64-year-old Grace Wiley loved the cobras best . They were the most intelligent , she thought , and the most easily tamed . " It 's just that people are afraid to try to tame them . They know that you can only fail once with a king cobra . " <P> But Grace Wiley had never been afraid , she handled her reptiles patiently and lovingly , filled one room of her Cypress , Calif , home with over a hundred of them : King and Queen , the cobras ; Roxy , the nine-foot python ; Perky , the water moccasin . They made her hobby , her life 's study and her reputation as one of the nation 's top herpetologists . Last week she readily agreed to pose for pictures with her newest pet : a five-foot cobra she had just received from India . <P> To get it into position for the picture , she patted its head , stroked its back , quietly coaxed it to extend its hood . As the cobra 's head began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was not responding well . " It 's getting nervous , " she said . " I 'd better put it away . " As she reached for it , the cobra struck . <P> For a full 30 seconds she struggled to get the needle-sharp fangs out of her middle finger , pressing with all her strength against the cobra 's locked jaws . When she had torn the snake loose and carefully returned it to its cage , she calmly instructed the photographer to apply tourniquets to her wrist and elbow told him where to find stimulants and needles . But the needles were rusty and the vials broke in the photographer 's hand . " Take me to a hospital at once , " she ordered . " This is serious . " <P> Forty minutes after the cobra struck , Mrs. Wiley was in Long Beach Municipal Hospital . The only antivenom serum there was from North American snakes , and useless for cobra bites . Her throat muscles had begun to contract ominously . Mrs. Wiley , now almost unconscious , shook her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was too late ; the paralysis was creeping through her chest . When it reached her heart muscles , an hour and forty minutes after she had been bitten , Grace Wiley died .
