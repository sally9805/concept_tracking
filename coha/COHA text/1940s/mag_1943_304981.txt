As nearly as any German city has ever been in this war , Hamburg was dead last week . Its streets were twisting lanes through tumbled wreckage . A few busses crept along them , while cars equipped with loudspeakers called on the population to leave . Hamburg had no gas , no electricity , no water , little food . Money existed no longer - food , busses and trains were simply taken where they could be had and no one asked for payment . In the ruins , on the streets , in the branches of trees where bombs had blown them , lay the dead , their eyes wide open , staring . <P> Foreign workers returning home to Denmark and Sweden brought such descriptions of the Reich 's second city , blasted by 10,000 tons of bombs in seven night raids by the R.A.F. , two daylight attacks by U.S. bombers . Dante 's Inferno , said one , was incomparable with Hamburg . Entire city districts were wiped out : St. Pauli , known to sailors the world over for its roller coasters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusement ; Altona , the " Red district " of pre-Hitler days , where Communists and Nazis had fought bitter , bloody battles on the streets ; the harbor with its huge shipyards , docks and warehouses . <P> The Bitterness .

Thirsty people besieged a truck from a fish market and drank the water dripping from the ice inside the fish boxes . <P> The Panic . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Refugees streamed from the stricken city , spread tales of horror . German propagandists had once spoken gloatingly of the destruction which their Luftwaffe visited on British cities ; they could find no words now to quell the rising terror of their people under the Allied bombs . The Vlkischer Beobachter , official organ of the Nazi Party , wrote : " The whole Reich and the largest cities are within reach of enemy planes . Nobody underestimates the imminence of danger . " Reich Marshal Hermann Gring , who once said : " If a single bomb should fall on German territory , then my name is Meyer , " visited Hamburg . There is no record of what Hamburg 's people said to him . <P> Hardest hit of all German cities by the news from Hamburg was Berlin . By official order , " unessential " civilians were evacuated . The Berlin radio claimed that more than a million people jammed trains and busses , carrying bundles , dragging children . The alarm rose when the R.A.F. served official notice on Berliners that their city was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens dug zigzag trenches while the long hospital trains with bomb-wounded crawled through the town .
