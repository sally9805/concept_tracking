For Chileans it was the choice of a President ; for the hemisphere it was the choice of an anti-Axis foreign policy . <P> For a while it looked as if Chile 's Presidential election this week would be close . Arrogant , handsome General Carlos Ibez del Campo , once his nation 's " strong man , " was backed by the rightist Conservative and Liberal Parties , the small but noisy pro-Nazi Popular Socialist Vanguard . Smooth , greying Juan Antonio Rios , veteran Radical Party politico , was backed by the middle-to-left Popular Front , fast recovering from its sickness following the death of President Pedro Aguirre Cerda last November . <P> A few nights before the election Ibez supporters put on an enthusiastic but disorganized demonstration in a Santiago public square . Two nights later at least 30,000 Rios partisans marched in superb order into the Plaza Bulnes , carrying such anti-Ibez slogans as BLOCKHEAD , RETURN TO BERLIN and LET 'S TURN HIM OVER TO JAPAN . <P> Election day was unusually orderly . But during the quiet the Popular Front , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dictatorial smell of General Ibez , rolled up a whacking majority of 55,000 ( out of 460,000 ) votes for Juan Antonio Rios . <P> With this smashing victory , it seemed certain that the new President would press for breaking relations with the Axis . The day before the election it was reported that Chile 's Foreign Minister Juan Bautista Rossetti , sensing which way the Chilean wind was blowing , had the same idea in mind .
