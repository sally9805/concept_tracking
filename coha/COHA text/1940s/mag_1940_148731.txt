On the day when Denmark awoke last week to find scuttle-helmeted Nazi infantrymen patroling its streets the U. S. awoke minus a $500,000-a-day export trade . Choking off the seaborne trade of the three Scandinavians as the U. S. S. R. had already choked the commerce of Good Customer Finland , Adolf Hitler had over night cut more than 5% from U. S. export trade , nearly 4% from her imports . <P> How else Blitzkrieg would affect U. S. business no man could say . Scandinavian trade is a complicated network which taps world ports from the Thames to the Weddell Sea , from Hammerfest to Antarctica . The tireless tramps of Norway , No. 4 world seafarer , carry the bulk of Cuban sugar shipments to the U. S. , play a bigger part in Philippines-U . S. traffic than the ships of any nation . South America , with an export balance of $20-25,000,000 annually to Scandinavia , has often used Scandinavian proceeds to buy U. S. goods . Great Britain got 50% of her bacon and eggs and 25% of her butter supply from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by corn , cottonseed cake , etc. from Great Britain , Brazil , Argentina , the U. S. <P> Exports . Since World War II began , U. S. exports to Scandinavia and Finland have rocketed 81% , for January-February of this year hit a total of well over $30,000,000 . For 1939 biggest item of U. S. sales was automobiles and accessories worth $22,210,000 . To Scandinavia went $24,102,000 in U. S. metals and manufactures , $28,853,000 in coal , petroleum products and other nonmetallic minerals , $12,624,000 in tires , rosin , soybeans , tobacco ; other millions in food , machinery , textiles , aircraft . Scandinavia might well have doubled its 1939 U. S. purchases , if World War II had not moved north . <P> Imports . No. 1 U. S. import from Scandinavia is newsprint and wood pulp . Of 3,550,000 tons of newsprint used in the U. S. last year , 300,000 came from Scandinavia and Finland . Of 9,003,000 tons of pulp used by U. S. manufacturers of kraft , newsprint , book papers , 1,305,000 came from Sweden , Norway and Finland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of newsprint still hung at $50 a ton as it had for two years , and big International Paper soothed apprehensive buyers by announcing its price would be maintained at $50 at least to Oct. 1 . But papermen could see complexities ahead , for the Northern European group was an important supplier of British newsprint , and Britain will have to call on No. 1 Newsprint Maker Canada for more of her supply . Last year , Canada supplied 2,206,000 tons of the newsprint used in the U. S. If Canada 's paper mills , now at about 70% of capacity , should have to extend themselves for Britain 's new needs , U. S. newspaper publishers might see a repetition of the days after World War I , when newsprint hit a top of $135.
