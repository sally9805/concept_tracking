txt General Sir Archibald P. Wavell , Supreme Commander of all United Nations Forces in the Southwest Pacific , has been ordered to resume his former post as Commander in Chief of India and Burma , leaving the Netherlanders in command of the final battle for the East Indies , the War and Navy Departments announced tonight . Emphasizing the rapidity of the Japanese march to the south and the rising threat to the United States positions in the Indian Ocean , the official communiqu ? ' explained that the Japanese conquest of Malaya and Sumatra , which separated Burma from the Netherlands Indies , had led to the decision to split the command and give the Netherlanders full charge of all the forces fighting in Java . The communiqu ? made clear , however , that this move did not in any way manifest an attitude that the fight for Java was being abandoned . The Netherlanders , it said , " are continuing to receive all available assistance from the United Nations . " Command Seen Abandoned The communiqu ? was interpreted by responsible officials as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill last Jan. 3 , had now been abandoned for the time being and that the battle for Java would be directed by the three Netherland chiefs , Lieut . Gen. Hein ter Poorten of the Army ; Vice Admiral C. E. L. Helfrich of the Navy , who has been in supreme command of all United Nations naval forces in the region , and Major Gen. L. H. van Oyen of the Air Force . All three of these chiefs , it was presumed , would be under the direction of A. W. L. van Starkenbergh Stachouwer , Governor General of the Netherlands Indies . While the hard facts of the military situation have necessitated this split in command , with General Wavell directing operations in India and in Burma , the Australians commanding the defense of their island and the Netherlanders commanding all forces in the Indies , the communiqu ? emphasized that " there is no change in the present arrangements for the general coordination of strategic policy in the war against Japan . " Special emphasis was made in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his new post for the coordination of the defense of India and Burma with the military operations in China . With the Burmese port of Rangoon , sea terminus of the Burma Road , now cut off from the United Nations , Chinese war supplies must pass through India or come from Russia . King 's Approval Cited For the first time in a considerable number of years a communiqu ? issued by the United States War and Navy Departments contained a reference to the British King . " With the approval of His Majesty the King , " it said , " General Wavell is resuming his appointment as Commander in Chief , India , which now includes responsibility for operations in Burma , and close cooperation with China . " This sentence was taken as symbolic of the close relationship that now exists between the nations fighting against the Axis . The inevitable reaction to the announcement was that the tide of Japanese invasion now was moving on the great Asiatic sub-continent of India with its 350,000,000 people . In the developing strategy of the war , India must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war against the United States , I Britain and the Netherlands proceeded , it was chosen as the central point to which most of the war munitions from the United Nations would be sent and from which they would be distributed to the theatres of the war wherever they were needed most urgently . At the same time , the Japanese , recognizing this , have already pushed their ships into the Indian Ocean in an attempt to interrupt this flow of supplies to Bombay and Calcutta . Nothing was said in the official communiqu ? about the position of Major Gen. George H. Brett , Chief of the United States Air Corps , who was appointed Deputy Supreme Commander of the Southwest Pacific Region . The headquarters of the Supreme Command was in Java , but officials at the War Department had no information to give out- whether General Brett would remain to assist the Netherlanders or go to India with General Wavell . General Wavell , who was - recommended for the post as Supreme Commander in the Southwest Pacific by . President Roosevelt ; is now taking over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was the ' first British commander in the Near East who made a successful advance against  --  the Germans and Italians in the Libyan desert . After that he was assigned to the post as Commander in Chief , India , and from there he was assigned to the command of the Allied forces in the Southwest I Pacific . Despite the cautious wording of the communique , it was generally interpreted as a prelude to the collapse of organized resistance in Java , last major United Nations stronghold in Malaysia and final source of oil and gasoline for the United Nations in that quarter of the world . The significance of these events for Australia is still obscure . The general impression here tonight was that the Japanese would not attempt any major invasion of this country , but would pass on to the attack on India as the next major step in their goal of pushing westward to meet the forces of their German and Italian allies somewhere in the Middle East .                @ @ @ @ @
