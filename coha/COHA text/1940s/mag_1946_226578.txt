Ever since DDT came out of the laboratory two years ago , chemists have been trying to improve on the " wonder killer . " Last week a Britisher announced his entry : " Activated DDT , " a concoction of pyrethrum and DDT. * <P> The inventor , Cambridge Chemist Harry Hurst , 34 , claimed that he had got rid of the defects in DDT ( see below ) . DDT is 1 ) slow , and 2 ) deadly to good as well as bad insects . Dr. Hurst said that some of his mixtures seem to be highly selective , attacking pests but leaving useful insects unharmed . He had also found Activated DDT lethal to some bothersome insects , notably cockroaches , which are not bothered much by DDT alone . <P> To demonstrate the speed of his killer , Dr. Hurst released 1,000 houseflies in a room 15 by 15 ft. , noted the wall spaces where most of them alighted , then painted the spots with his preparation . In 27 minutes every fly was dead . <P> Other demonstrations have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had no truck with 240 shops of the big British chain , Marks and Spencer ; Dr. Hurst 's spot-painting did the trick ( one store which he treated only once , on August 22 , 1945 , has not had a fly since ) . <P> Several badly infested London hospitals have been completely cleared of cockroaches ; a Hurst emulsion not only killed all adult roaches at once but persisted long enough to destroy young ones as they hatched . <P> A Marseilles businessman , Emille Bouche , sprayed a 20-acre orchard infested with cockchafers , killed them all in 21 minutes . Honey bees ( normally vulnerable to DDT ) seemed undamaged . To find out whether Activated DDT was toxic to animals , Bouche fed 400 hens for two weeks on an exclusive diet of poisoned cockchafers . The hens thrived . Bouche , much impressed , promptly invested his all in building seven French factories for manufacturing Activated DDT . <P> <P> U.S. entomologists last week made a preliminary report on another sensational British insect killer , Gammexane , claimed to be five times as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . It has an unpleasant naphthalene smell , lacks DDT 's lasting effect . It is particularly potent against cockroaches , proved effective in checking a locust plague in Sardinia this spring , and has shown promise against the cotton boll weevil . But in the sunny U.S. climate it has been generally less lethal than in foggy Britain . <P> <P> * A mixture of quick " knockdown " pyrethrum and DDT has been used in many preparations , notably the U.S. Army 's " aerosol " insect bombs , now being sold to U.S. householders . But Activated DDT is supposed to penetrate an insect 's chitin ( outer skin ) and reach its nervous system more surely than previous mixtures .
