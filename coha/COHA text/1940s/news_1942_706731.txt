txt The Senate Finance Committee completed its work today on individual income tax rates by voting , 9 to 7 , to lower them slightly in the bottom brackets to compensate in part for the added burden of the new " Victory Tax " and to raise them in the middle brackets to an extent calculated to produce a net revenue gain of about $33,000,000 . The action was taken as Henry Morgenthau , Secretary of the Treasury , told his press conference he was now in favor of forced savings legislation to supplement the tax bill and make up for the failure of war bond sales to close the " inflationary gap . " His reversal of his former position came a day after the Finance Committee decided not-to consider including such a plan in the present bill but to create a committee to study the proposal further and report on Jan. 11 . The committee also approved a sharp increase in personal transportation taxes estimated to bring in about $35,000,000 more than the increases in the House bill and took minor actions affecting revenue in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transportation tax , approved by the committee on the recommendations of the Treasury and the Office of Defense Transportation , would put a 15 per cent tax on day coach railroad , bus and other similar fares , and would put a 20 per cent tax on fares for transport by Pullman and similar luxury travel , as against the 10 per cent in the House bill and the 5 per cent in the present law on both types of travel . The rates would not apply to trips of thirty miles or less , thus having no effect on most commuter travel . A decision , reversing yesterday 's stand , returned to the provisions of present law regarding exemptions from estate taxes . This will result in a gain of $15,000,000 over the House bill , which had changed the present exemption of $40,000 on receipts from insurance policies plus $40,000 on other estate assets to a straight $60,000 exemption . Revision of Rates on Income The Senate committee 's changes in individual income rates would slightly reduce the taxes of single persons with less than $2,000 of surtax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such income and would slightly increase the taxes on the middle brackets above these levels . Splitting of the brackets into $500 steps below the $2,000 level , the provision imposes a surtax rate of 10 per cent on the first $500 of net income above personal exemptions , 13 per cent on the next $500 , 15 per cent on the third and 17 per cent on the fourth . Under the House bill the rate was a flat 13 per cent on the first $2,000 of surtax net income . From $2,000 to $3,000 of surtax net income the rate would be 19 per cent instead of the 16 per cent in the House bill and on $3,000 to $4,000 it would be 21 per cent instead of 16 . For $4,000 to $6,000 it would be 23 per cent instead of 20 and for $6,000 to $8,000 , 25 per cent instead of 24 . Above $8,000 the proposed rates are the same as in the House bill , starting at 28 per cent and increasing until they reach 82 per cent on surtax net income above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessity of specific legislation requested by President Roosevelt to limit maximum income available for personal spending to $25,000 , explaining that a person would have to have about a $5,000,000 yearly gross income to have more than $25,000 left after taxes . The maximum changes in taxes to be paid under the proposed modifications of the House rates would be an increase of $95 in the tax of a married man with no dependents who earned $5,000 and a maximum decrease of $15 in the tax of a single person earning $1,200 . The committee rejected the House bill tax on cigarette papers and tubes with a loss of revenue which the House committee estimated at $7,000,000 , although Mr. George said this amount was disputed as too large . At the request of Administration officials , the 5 per cent House increase from the present rate of 10 per cent on international telephone and telegraph messages was - rejected on the ground that it might hamper international communication essential to war . A $3-a-gallon tax on industrial alcohol imported from Cuba under present law would be removed by another provision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The committee rejected a Treasury recommendation for an $8-abarrel tax on beer in place of the $7 in the House bill , which is up $1 above present law . Morgenthau for More Saving Mr. Morgenthau told reporters that the $3,650,000,000 " Victory Tax " written into the bill by the Finance Committee yesterday contained an element of forced savings but did not " do the job " completely . In addition to normal and surtax income taxes , it imposes a levy of 5 per cent on all individual income over $12 a week , with credit allowable for debt payments , insurance premiums and war bond purchases and with a portion of the tax payment returnable after the war . The Secretary said that additional forced savings would be necessary to bridge the " inflationary gap " of $20,000,000,000 to $30,000,000,000 between the amount people will be able to spend next year and the amount of consumer goods available . Continued failure of the voluntary plan to bring in the funds set up in the monthly quotas , he said , had made it clear that more stringent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he replied : " That means forced savings . Let 's call it by its ugliest name ; we might as well . "
