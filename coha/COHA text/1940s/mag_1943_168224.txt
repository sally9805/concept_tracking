On Attu the fighting was over except for the last cleanup , and U.S. fighting men were getting soldiers ' burial . TIME Correspondent Robert Sherrod ( one of nine correspondents officially commended for their behavior under fire ) , wrote the following description of the grim epilogue to one of the hardest battles U.S. soldiers ever fought . <P> All night long the caterpillar tractors have towed their trailers over the valleys and plateaus between Attu 's high peaks . Today 125 of our dead are lined up for burial in the Little Falls Cemetery ( named for a nearby waterfall ) near Massacre Bay - one of our two graveyards on Attu . <P> Mostly they are those who died in the Jap 's mad fanatical rush of Saturday and Sunday . Many are horribly mangled by bayonets and rifle butts . Many were obviously shot and killed , then stabbed time after time by the strange little yellow men who then proceeded to die , as violently as possible , sometimes by their own hands . <P> More dead will be brought to the cemetery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans who died on the precipitous slopes of this grey little island . Fortunately , the 40 weather does not require that we bury the dead immediately . After we have finished burying our own dead , we shall collect the 800 or more enemy bodies still lying around and bury them too . <P> ( Later : More than 1,000 Jap bodies have been buried in one day , mostly by the troops who had slain them . Men who had killed Japs calmly and efficiently , who had picked up their own dead with tight-lipped calm , vomited as they collected the bodies of the enemy . ) <P> Last Post . No nation handles its casual ties as carefully as we do . The 125 who lie in rows at the edge of the crude cemetery were examined meticulously . A medical officer ( Captain Louvera B. Schmidt of Salem , Ore. ) recorded the cause of death and the number and type of wounds as each body was unclothed . Members of the graves registration company cut open each pocket and placed the personal effects of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depot at Kansas City . One identification tag has been left on each body , the other nailed to the cross which will be placed above the grave until a larger metal plate can be stamped . The graves are laid out in perfect geometrical pattern ; they have been charted so that no mistake can be made in locating any body . <P> Three sets of fingerprints were made from the hands of each dead man . One set stays with the man 's military unit , two will be sent to the Adjutant General in Washington . ( If a soldier 's " dog tags " are missing and his personal effects carry no absolute identification , his body is not buried until some men from his unit have made positive identification . ) <P> After fingerprinting , the bodies were carried through the identification tent and wrapped in khaki blankets tied at three places : around the neck , the waist and the feet . <P> The graves are being dug now by bulldozers-there is no time nor labor available to dig them with shovels . The bulldozers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been scooped out , which is long enough to place eight bodies 18 inches apart . Then into the collective grave small one-foot deep individual graves are scooped out by shovel . Thus , each man lies with seven of his comrades .
