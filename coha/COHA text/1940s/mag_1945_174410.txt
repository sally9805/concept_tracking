Kindly , seamy-faced Major General Oscar W. Griswold , commander of the U.S. Sixth Army 's XIV Corps , stood in somber triumph last week on a field of horror . After 20 days of battle , Manila 's smoking ruins were his . <P> Around the General stretched ten square miles of devastation , gutted office buildings , wrecked churches , a huge junkpile of crumpled tin . roofs . And stinking in the rubble were the bodies of at least 12,000 Japanese , merged in death 's sickly odor with the bodies of thousands of Filipinos . The end came in fiery drama . <P> Up from the south drove Major General Verne D. Mudge 's ist Cavalry troopers , battering their way through the modern-style apartment houses of the fashionable Ermita district . They fought their way up through the balconied Manila Hotel from the first floor to the penthouse where General Douglas MacArthur once lived . <P> Down from the north drove Major General Robert S.

An observer who watched the first shells drive home growled : " Christ , 755 just bounce off that wall . " Beightler mustered h 's guns . In one hour , in the greatest land barrage of the Pacific war , 10,000 shells smashed into the wall and the city just beyond .

A few yards beyond , in the convent basement where faggots were stored , the body of a woman in a blue dress lay twisted on the ground . " <P> Leaving forces to reduce the last few Japanese strong points , Major General Griswold 's troops turned east from Manila , reached the hill villages of San Isidro and Montalban . <P> South of Manila , 11th Division paratroopers and amphibious forces struck suddenly for the prison camp at Los Baos , 25 miles behind the Japanese lines . They caught the darkly sinister commandant , Lieut . Konishi , lining up his charges for morning roll call . They killed the lieutenant and his 243 guards , rescued 2,146 sick and starving civilian internees . <P> Off southern Luzon Americal Division jungle fighters , veterans of Guadalcanal and Bougainville , seized Capul and Biru , two tiny , strategically important islands dominating San Bernardino Strait , shortest shipping route to the U.S. <P> Corregidor fortress rocked and shook as the Japanese , sealed off in underground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
