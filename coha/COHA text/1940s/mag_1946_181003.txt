When a homesick G.I. longs for something " as American as the corner drugstore , " the odds are five to one that the store he is thinking of is a Rexall store . And the odds are going down . Last week the United-Rexall Drug Inc. , biggest in the U.S. , floated a new $11,000,000 stock issue . With the proceeds , United will buy the 19-store Renfro chain in Texas ( for $1,200,000 ) , will enlarge and remodel the 541 stores it already has as well as some of the 10,000 affiliated Rexall druggists . <P> What United wants to do with its stores was shown fortnight ago when the first Owl " Superstore " opened its doors on Hollywood 's busiest corner , Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street . It looked like a De Mille glorification of a drugstore-indirect lighting , air-conditioning and a 56-stool counter-fountain , with endless belt to bring food from the kitchen and carry back dirty dishes . <P> Up with Walgreen 's . A chain of such stores has been the dream of United 's energetic , athletic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was started in the drug business by Charles R. Walgreen Sr. , then his father-in-law . He soon proved that his job did not depend on nepotism . Over the objections of fellow executives , he busily rearranged the interiors of Walgreen drugstores , showed that it was just as important to put an article in the right place in a store as to put the right things in the manufacture of the article . Sample change : he separated soda fountains and drug counters , so that soda-sippers and sandwich-chewers would n't be confronted by laxative ads . ( Now he buries prescription counters in the back of stores lest they take up valuable space for rag dolls , books , etc . ) In 1941 United hired Dart away from Walgreen 's ( his wife had divorced him 2 years before ) , upped him to President of United later . He consolidated United 's sprawling holdings , bought up its bad leases , closed down unprofitable stores , built up good will . <P> Independent druggists disliked the way the company sold them its own manufactured products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand and set up competing chain stores with another . Dart calmed the independents by closing some of his weaker competing chain stores and offering independents the benefit of United 's mass purchasing power . Last week Dart carried this plan even further . He put the 10,000 independent Rexall stores , which hold exclusive franchises for United 's products , on an equal footing with the company-owned chain stores . United will now help finance the expansion programs of any affiliated druggists who want to grow , hopes thus to build Dart 's chain of super drugstores . <P> West with United . During United 's period of consolidation , net earnings fell from $2,527,424 in 1941 to $1,970,971 in 1945 . One big item was $580,000 spent last fall by President Dart to move United-Rexall 's headquarters from Boston to Los Angeles . This move was part of the bargain he made with United : if he could move HQ west , he would stay at $75,000 a year , instead of taking the offered presidency of Montgomery Ward and Co. at $150,000 . The trade gossiped that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie starlet Jane Bryan . But Dart had a more hardheaded reason . He simply thinks that in Los Angeles ' pleasant climate his staff would work better .
