txt Postmaster General Frank Walker has begun a crusade to advance Yuletide cheer well into the autumn His program is to get the department store organs playing Christmas carols throughout November He wants red and green mercantile decorations hung long before snow flies . He wants Christmas shopping done and packages mailed before December He 's told all his postmasters they are responsible for enlisting the aid of merchants . newspapers , radios . schools and even churches in this effort . A. message to them asserts that " the war has dislocated the Christmas season . This year November is the season for mailing gifts . " Back of thi ; Is one terrific manpower and equipment shortage , The Post Office Department is requesting more , baggage and maul cars to handle an ' expected historic outpouring-of packaged generosity financed by warswollen incomes Officials say cars are a bottleneck because great numbers have been diverted to War Department use . Numbers System Helps Mailmen Ordinarily there are some 330 000 post ' office employes . Nearly 10 , , of these have departed for other tasks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas season . Officials are optimistic about being able to hire this many  --  but pessimistic about the quality of the emergency manpower Instead of getting bright young college lads , as formerly , they say they will have to rely on elderly ladies and irresponsible high school youngsters Students all over the country . already being trained . will get 4 cents an hour . Two factors will be on the side of th , , mailmen in their approaching battle with the Yule spirit . One is the adoption of the numbering system in 124 cities . A package marked " Chicago , 30. " or " New York , 11. " is easy for a green worker unfamiliar with addresses to handle . The other boon is the system of early deadlines for mailing to men in the armed forces overseas . It was October 15 for soldiers : It is November 1 for Navy men . About 15 million packages are on their way to soldiers abroad  --  three times more than last year . About 500 000 pieces have been arr.ving at debarkation points daily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million packages are expected to be sent to members of all the armed services abroad . They are expected to arrive on time , though gifts for the Army may have to be sent overland for great distances after a sea journey , and presents for sailors aboard ship can be de ) ivered only by sending them to the nearest port with which their craft have contact . The job of the Post Office Department is over when mail for the armed services arrives at points of debarkation . Responsibility is taken over by about 1.600 Post Office ern , ployes who have gone into the Army and , Navy as part of their postal services . The October 15 Army mailing deadline . incidentally . can be circumvented by a curious rigamarole . Under Government regulations a civilian may ask a soldier to send a letter requesting a present . If this letter is presented at a post office , the civilian may still mail a Christmas gift to the Army man . He may mail a gift , even without such a letter . if it weighs less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer guarantees delivery by Christmas .
