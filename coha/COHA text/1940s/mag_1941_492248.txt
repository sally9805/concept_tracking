HANK GREENBERG is not quite the best player in baseball , but he is unquestionably the most controversial figure in the game today . Controversy swirls around Greenberg like confetti in a high wind . Critics can examine the record , which shows Greenberg has hit more than .300 for Detroit every season and has driven in more runs than any other athlete since he entered the major leagues in 1933 , and interpret it as meaning that large Henry is ( a ) inconsistent ; ( 1 ) : in the exalted class of Ruth , Gehrig , Foxx and DEVIaggio . Some writers made Greenberg the goat when Detroit lost the World Series of 1934 and 1940 . Yet in both he was the Tigers ' leading manufacturer of runs . Experts say Greenberg is strictly a synthetic ballplayer . Rapturous rooters insist their man 's shift last year from first base to the outfield was a pretty wonderful demonstration of his natural gifts- as well as the chief reason why Detroit won the American League pennant . The Successful Pessimist HE confusions Greenberg provokes make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three years ago , for example , he hit nine home runs in a week to jump sixteen days ahead of Babe Ruth 's record-breaking schedule of sixty homers in 1927 ? which every male of Detroit knew by palpitating heart . On July thirty-first , when the streak ended , Hank happened to strike out after hitting his thirty-first homer . The indignant customers raised the roof of Briggs Stadium with violent boos . Greenberg threatened to beat Ruth 's record down to the final day of the 1938 season . But discussions of his chances occupied little more space than profound pieces which attempted to determine how many of his fifty-eight homers could be traced to Manager Del Baker 's success in stealing signals from the opposition and transmitting same to Greenberg . This turmoil is nothing but an amplified echo of the inner disturbances which have been agitating Greenberg for eleven years , or since he has been playing professional baseball . Always fighting himself , the fellow is a pessimistic perfectionist who has succeeded brilliantly despite an involved mental process which probably would make failure certain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mediocrity , then promptly performs in a manner to make ordinary ballplayers look like so many mugs , and winds up with shots of self-confidence in the arm long after the necessity for stimulation has passed . He convinced the experts he was the American League 's most valuable player in 1935 before he convinced himself he was a big-leaguer . Voted the same honor last season , the award arrived almost simultaneously with his sudden realization that he was no clown in the outfield . Even then he was a trifle skeptical until he was elected the left fielder on the All Star team , which he had made previously as a first baseman . Controversy has made Greenberg the highest-salaried player in the business . And controversy has made ambitious Henry what he is today a. great competitor who could he traded , even up , for any major-leaguer with the exception of DiMaggio and Bob Feller . It is significant that all factions are in complete accord on two issues , the keys to Greenberg 's character and career . One and all agree that Greenberg ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who has played the game ; ( b ) has demonstrated that intelligence and imagination are no handicaps to a ballplayer , a proposition directly opposed to the theories fostered by John J. McGraw . Greenberg is purely a self-made star . He has been in the American League only eight years , yet he has spent more time on the ball field than a twenty-year veteran . His enormous capacity for work staggers everyone but Greenberg himself . Every spring he wears out every athlete at training camp . A player who has achieved Greenberg 's prominence normally reports at the hall park about one o'clock in the afternoon , hangs around for an hour playing cards or telling amiable lies , goes out for a bit of light limbering and a few rounds of batting practice , then plays a two-hour game . Greenberg works an eight-hour day . He has spent ao much time in Briggs Stadium that the groundkeepers once suspected he had set up light housekeeping there to save room rent . In 19:38 , when he was bidding for Ruth 's record , Greenberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the neighbors ' children to pitch to him at nine o'clock in the morning , and frequently after a game until sundown . Long after he was rated the best defensive first baseman in the league , he continued to labor on fielding flaws . In 1936 , when he was out the entire season with a broken wrist , Greenberg merely had to show up on the first and fifteenth of the month to collect his pay checks . Instead , he climbed into his monkey suit every morning and chased ! lingoes for three hours a day to keep his legs in shape . ? " When I was a kid , I played eight hours a day for nothing , " he explains . " I 'd be a sucker not to feel as enthusiastic about baseball , now that I 'm getting important money ( Continued from Page 35 ) for doing the same thing . Playing under perfect conditions is no hardship for one who shoveled snow off Crotona Field in the Bronx in March , just to throw around an old taped ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The majors are n't tops ; it 's just the beginning , like reaching the senior year in college . Becoming a senior is no guaranty of graduation . The rookies on a certain second-division team in the American League last year played eighteen holes of golf practically every morning . Then they went out to the ball park and hung around the batting cage in prac- tice , complaining about their tough life and putting the blast on the owners . I 'd like to beat those kids ' heads against a brick wall and knock some sense into them . " That 's what he says and that 's what he really believes . Greenberg has devoted so much thought to his profession that virtually every move is a picture of a mental image conceived long before he goes through the motions . He says his best hitting is done by thinking . He can even tell you the precise , soul-searching moment he became a ballplayer in his own estimation . The great awakening came late in February , 1935 ? six months , characteristically , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season the Tigers were promising to give Detroit its first pennant in a quarter of a century . With six weeks to go , the athletes became overwhelmed with the importance of it all and went into a series of slumps . Goose Goslin , who was hitting in the vital fourth position , was one of the principal victims of the slump . Greenberg , then in his second season with the Tigers and hitting sixth , went to Manager Mickey Cochrane and asked to be put in the fourth spot . He did it knowing full well he would be given an unmerciful going-over if he failed to deliver . Cochrane , willing to try anything , promoted Greenberg to Goslin 's place and Detroit moved to the pennant swiftly . Greenberg single-handedly pulled his colleagues out of their tail spin by winning three big games in three days . On September eighth , after dropping three straight to the Athletics , the Tigers won , 2-1 ; Greenberg scoring both runs with a single . On September ninth , the Tigers defeated the Red Sox , 5-4 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pay-off point . On September tenth the Tigers shaded the Sox again , by a 2-1 score , and Greenberg accounted for all the runs with two homers . He finished the season with 139 runs batted in , high man among the Tigers , and led both sides in r.b.i. ' s in the 1934 World Series . When he reported at training camp the following spring , there was only uric person who did not regard him as a full-fledged major leaguer . The dissenter was H. Greenberg . He was brooding over a secret weakness . How Valuable is Hank ? " T WAS afraid I did n't have the guts to hit fourth behind Gehringer , " he confides . " The records show 1 did all right in the closing week of ' 34 , but in my own mind I had shown the white feather . " Gehringer had a tremendous year in 1934 . He batted .356 and he led the league in hits and runs scored . It seemed he was on base every time I went up , and that meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were two out , to make things tougher for me . Charley has a wonderful eye , the best I 've ever seen , and he drew a lot of walks . His habit of taking two strikes before swinging drove me nuts while I was waiting my turn . I was horrified to find myself rooting against Gehringer . ' Pop up or get a hit , ' I 'd mutter to myself , but do n't walk and put it up to me . ' " It was just like selling out the team , but I could n't help it . That 's what bothered me during the winter . I tried giving myself pep talks . ' If you fail , do n't fail before you try , ' I kept repeating , but it did n't ring true . " We had been in training camp a week , and one day I looked around the field and suddenly realized there were fellows on the team who did n't have half my ability . ' Most of these guys have gone farther with less than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger physically than anyone and I 've got it all over them mentally . What 's there to stop me ? ' " I never realized until then what a ballplayer I had a chance to be . It dawned upon me that the pitchers were more scared of me than I was of them . They had to get me out four times in a game , but I had to hit only one to ruin them . My entire career opened up in those few seconds . I went to Cochrane and asked to hit fourth . ' It stands to reason I should , ' I argued . ' I 'm the longest hitter on the club . I can win ball games for you . The only way to steel myself is to go up time and again with men on base until I get accustomed to feeling loose under pressure . ' " Cuchrane agreed , of course . It was his intention to use Greenberg in the powerhouse position all t lie time . Hank has remained there ever since . Baseball men consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player 's value . By this standard , Greenberg uncontestahly is , and has been for six years , the most valuable player in baseball . Joe DiMaggio has unanimous ranking as the No. 1 player in the game today . In five full seasons he has driven in 691 runs . Greenberg drove in 725 during his first five complete seasons . Jimmy Foxx , the Boston strong boy , has been a tremendous performer for twelve years . Since 1933 , when Greenberg went up to the majors , he has averaged 141 runs batted in a season against 135 for Foxx , Joe Medwick , whose career has been concurrent with Greenberg 's , has been the National League 's most prolific author of runs during his tenure , with 962 r.b.i. ' s to his credit . Greenberg has accounted for 1003 runs , although his wrist was broken after he bad played in only twelve games in 1936 and he was out for the year . Yet the academic argument that Hank is a made , not a natural , hitter still persists . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , but Hammering Henry delights in these abstract propositions . He likes nothing better than to sit and talk with friends  --  and he has great facility for going to his right and left in any given discussion . Brother Joe , who played third for Shreveport last year , may break a lull in the conversation with the offhand observation that Hank is inconsistent . Hank will agree , to keep the ball rolling . But when the crowd begins to throw the hooks into him with too much abandon , he will consult the little black book kept by Adolph Simons , a family friend and a house painter by trade . The book shows that Hank had only twenty-four hitless games last season  --  or one a week on the average . It is easy to talk to Greenberg but difficult to know him . No ballplayer has more acquaintances and fewer intimate friends . The glad-handers bore him stiff with their small talk , and the men with whom he works simply do not ponder the psychological intricacies of baseball , the phase of the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Greenberg tries to conform to the private life expected of a ballplayer , against his inner will . Most players hunt during the off season . Greenberg hates hunting , but once a year he sets out on an expedition ? and returns within thirty-six hours . He prefers to keep in condition on a stuffy , smelly four-wall handball court three times a week during the winter . Greenberg likes night clubs , bright lights and pretty girls . Who does n't ? Fans , however , always have been agile in jumping to conclusions , and columnists who have created the impression that Greenberg has been engaged to every show girl on Broadway and has led more conga lines than any man in America have embarrassed Hank repeatedly . He still is a regular in the night league , but publicity has driven him to the quiet eating places , where he punches the bag interminably with the sporting crowd . Spiking the Rumors An articulate gent , Greenberg has been put squarely on the spot by people who have misquoted him . Last September someone asked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he believed ballplayers would not be called in the first draft . He was reported as having said ballplayers should not be called . The garbled statement led to serious complications several weeks later , when Greenberg drew local order No. 621 in Michigan 's Wayne County Selective Service Board No. 23 , ordered to furnish 409 men for service by June thirtieth . No athlete in the country , not even Joe Louis , will lose more in time and money than Greenberg if he is drafted , but to spike ugly rumors , he voluntarily submitted himself for examination long before he was required to appear . He was told that although his number will be called on schedule he probably will be given a deferment until October . Then he 'll report ? and say good-by to baseball for 1942 . Dignity is the keynote of Green-berg 's public relations . He never has endorsed cigarettes , which he does n't use , or a headache remedy , which he does use . He could be booked solidly on the banquet.circuit at $100 a crack for reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such offers . Last year he made only $250 above his salary from the Detroit club , mostly in royalties from the sale of bats and gloves . When he barely missed Ruth 's home-run record , well-meaning newspapermen commiserated with him on the ground that he had lost at least $10,000 in vaudeville bookings alone . Greenberg replied that he had n't lost a dime . Said he would n't have made a damn fool of himself on any stage , at any price . " I 'll have enough money to live for the rest of my life , " he says , " but I do n't call that living . That 's just existing . I 'd like to learn another business , but I ca n't work for twenty bucks a week  --  which is all I 'm worth  --  because people would think I was keeping another fellow out of a job . I could make a pile of money selling insurance , but that would n't be fair to the people I sold . I have n't made a study of insurance ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expect . " The Metamorphosis of Big Bruggy In public , Greenberg picks up checks in the expansive , big-league manner . But he lives modestly with his parents  --  Rumanian emigrants , who went to see him play , even in grade school  --  in the same three-story house the family occupied twenty years ago . That Hank has become a national celebrity is a great surprise to people who knew him when he was an awkward kid with two left feet at James Monroe High School in New York . Big Bruggy , as he was called then , played on city-championship teams in baseball , soccer and basketball , tried football for a year and occasionally put the shot for the track team . Soccer and basketball were his best games . " Hank never played games , he worked at them , " Irwin Dickstein , Greenberg 's high-school basketball coach , reports . " He was n't a natural athlete . His reactions were slow and he had trouble co-ordinating his big body . He could n't run a lick because he had flat feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts to overcome that handicap . What I remember particularly are the questions he asked . He always was trying to figure outwhy certain plays failed and others clicked . In those days we used a huddle in basketball before each jump at center . Hank even held up the game to find out why things happened . " He was n't a prima donna , but he was hard to handle because he 'd get depressed about nothing at all . If he was free for a shot , for instance , and a teammate neglected to pass him the ball , Hank would brood about it all game . Another kid would figure the fellow with the ball had n't seen him . Flank , abnormally shy and sensitive , suspected he had been overlooked deliberately . I believe his size made him self-conscious . He was a great competitor because he hated to lose to smaller boys . " In 1928 , Monroe played Thomas Jefferson High for the soccer championship . The first half was uneventful until Big Bruggy suddenly tossed his right shoe to the side line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of the substitutes had a size 14 hoof , an underling was dispatched in search of a hammer . Time out is not allowed in soccer for such trivials , so Big Bruggy ) stalled for ten minutes by kicking the ball over adjacent fences with his bare foot . In due time his shoe was returned and Monroe won , 1-0 . Paul Krichell , the Yankee scout , saw Greenberg play baseball in high school , but nothing came of it . Greenberg was not outstanding  --  in that undistinguished company . Krichell was looking over Rudy Herzog , Monroe pitcher  --  who remained an unknown  --  and merely asked the first baseman 's name . But the big kid who had taken his lunch in a brown paper bag to Crotons Field during summer vacations , rather than go two blocks to his home and miss a few precious minutes of practice , was not discouraged . Graduated from Monroe in February , 1929 , Greenberg intended to ma2triculate at New York University . but persuaded his father to permit him to stay out until the September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parkways , a semi-pro team in Brooklyn , and proceeded to belabor twenty-fivedollar-a-game pitchers . The next time Krichell saw him , eighteen-year-old Henry had the good fortune to hit three homers in a game against the House of David . Krichell offered him $1000 on the spot to sign a Yankee contract . Greenberg had the presence of mind , while in a coma , to murmur something to the effect that he wanted to go to college . A few days later Krichell boosted the ante to $1000 in cash and $500 a year while Greenberg was in college  --  or $3000 in all . Ed Barrow ' the big brain of the Yankees , invited Hank to lunch and fed him a stirring oration on the benefits to be derived from signing with his organization . The family , meeting in solemn conference , decided Henry should grab the offer . Mom and pop were enthusiastic because they thought their son would be near home . Henry knew he would n't be within a sleeper jump of New York during the season unless he broke a leg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Yankees and was as permanent as the franchise . In spite of it all , Henry promised he would go with the Yankees if they raised the price to $4000 . It is interesting to contemplate how radically recent baseball history would have been rewritten had the Yankees made one more phone call to Greenberg . After Hank asked $4000 , two weeks elapsed without word from the club . Greenberg , believing the Yankees had soured on him , lent an attentive ear to Jean Dubuc , Detroit scout , who saw him play with the Bay Parkways . Dubuc was anxious to get the boy out of New York , away from the opposition . He got Greenberg a job at East Douglas , Massachusetts , where Walter Schuster owned a large woolen mill and ran a company team for his own amusement . Schuster was a baseball nut of purest ray serene . For the satisfaction of having Lefty Grove pitch in his park , he offered the great southpaw a guaranty of $1000 for one game and a bonus of $100 for every hatter he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an afternoon of light exercise , the record fee for a ball game . Greenberg went to East Douglas and went slowly crazy . All the other players on Schuster 's team worked in the mill during the day , and homesick Henry knew no one in town . He was n't even playing in the industrial-league games . East Douglas had a certain Doc Couillard on first base and Schuster saw no reason to replace an adequate veteran with a kid . With the Bay Parkways , Greenberg got fifteen dollars a double-header . Schuster paid his expenses at the hotel and nothing more . That was n't as bad as the maddening inactivity . After three weeks of doing nothing , Greenberg on a Thursday told Winfield Schuster , the owner 's son and a former Brown University baseball captain , he was going home after the game that Saturday . Winfield went to his dad and urged him to give the New York kid a trial . Through what Thomas Wolfe called the dark miracle of chance , four major-league scouts happened to be in East Douglas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early in July , 1929 . Dubuc was there , and so was Kriebel , who had wondered what had become of the boy and had discovered his whereabouts upon calling Greenberg 's home . In addition , Bill Hinchman and Joe Engel , ivory hunters for the Pirates and Senators , were present . Two hours after Greenberg 's debut , the four scouts were cutting one an-other 's throats industriously . Greenberg hit a monumental homer over the trees in left field as well as a double . Schuster was delighted and gave Greenberg $256 to keep him in East Douglas . But that was peanuts compared to the folding money the scouts waved before the boy . Engel made the best offer  --  a flat bonus of $10,000 and a contract for $800 a month to play first base for the Senators immediately , an important concession since it eliminated the drudgery of the minors . Greenberg , however , was determined to go to college . Engel said his offer had to be accepted on the spot or not at all . Greenberg declined . He felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Douglas and the clincher was Detroit 's willingness to wait four years for him . Greenberg signed with the Tigers for $9000 ? $3000 immediately , with the balance to be paid after he completed his schooling . Rookie 's Progress Greenberg 's desire to go to college was genuine . He enrolled at New York University in September , 1929 , and finished the first semester of a commercial course . He had every intention of continuing . But it was February . the ball teams were going south . He could not concentrate on books and he merely had to say the word to get $6000 . He wrote Frank Navin , president of the Tigers , asking permission to report to the team . Navin sent a check for $6000 and expenses to Tampa by return mail . Detroit treated Greenberg royally his first year . giving him $500 a month , which undoubtedly made him the highest-salaried player at Raleigh and Hartford . By 1931 he was just another sweaty slave in the Tiger chain and he soon learned how the other half lived . He got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $100 a month in 1932 at Beaumont , in the Texas League , where he finished his apprenticeship by hitting thirty-nine homers , driving in 131 runs and winning the most-valuable-player award fur helping his team to the championship . When Greenberg reported to the Tigers at San Antonio in February , 193:3 , he was swell copy . Everything about him attracted , and held , attention : His size , 6 feet , 4 inches ; his photogenic face , probably the handsomest in baseball ; his ability to swat a ball a short country mile . His Jewishness led to some difficulties , although not nearly as many as the bleeding hearts would have you believe . Everything was wonderful ? except that Bucky Harris , the manager , could n't see him with a telescope as a major leaguer . Harris had recommended the purchase , for $50,000 , of Harry Davis , the regular Hank was trying to supplant . Davis , the Babe Dahlgren of his time , was a fancy Dan at first base , but a lightweight hitter . Harris tried to appease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hank 's hitting to the fans back home , by playing Greenberg at third base , where he could look only terrible . The experiment lasted six weeks and Hank finally was put on third base in an exhibition game with Greenberg owned the town in 1935 , when he led the Tigers to another pennant with 170 r.b.i. ' s , high for the league , and tied Foxx for the home-run title . There still are people in Detroit who insist the Yankees ' four-year reign of terror , begun in 1936 , would have been forestalled a season if Greenberg had not been injured early in the year . In the second game of the ' 35 World Series , Greenberg 's left wrist was fractured when the Cubs ' substantial Gabby Hartnett fell on him while he was scoring a run . The same bone was broken all over again in the twelfth game of the 1936 season . It really was a bad break r sir : because Greenberg , ordinarily a slow starter , had left the barrier with a rush and had driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put out for the season . There was some doubt that he could come hack in 1937 . But Greenberg routed the skeptics with what he calls his best season . His boisterous bat accounted for 183 runs , only one fewer than the all-time league record made by Lou Gehrig . Up to that tune Greenberg was so sensitive to the censure of the customers that he confesses he actually felt embarrassed when he struck out . His attitude changed abruptly in 1938 , when he developed a protective shell of indifference . It was a question of going philosophical or potty . for he was a target for more harpoons than Moby Dick . Instead of applauding him for hitting fifty-eight homers. some lovely characters jeered Greenberg for choking up when Ruth 's record was within his grasp . They overlooked the fact that Henry hit twelve homers in the last twenty-one games , the equivalent of eighty-eight a season at the same rate . The caustic customers went overboard completely for Greenberg last I season when the Tigers , a fifth-place club in 1939 , climbed over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Series . Greenberg made it possible by leaving first base , which he had mastered after years of backbreaking work , and going to the outfield , thereby giving Rudy York a chance to play at the only position where he qualified as a major leaguer . The Problem of Rudy The shift was not made willingly by Greenberg . As usual , he was nut confident of his ability to learn the tricks of the outfield trade . Then , too , he wondered out loud why he , an established star , should jeopardize his career for York , who had not proved he could play anywhere in big-league fashion . Potentially a fine hitter , York had been Detroit 's problem child for three years . He had gone to the Tigers in 1937 as a first baseman , but could not displace Greenberg , of course . There followed a series of experiments to find a position York could play without letting in more runs than he drove in . All failed . They tried the big Cherokee at third base and he played it like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store . He was told to do the best he could as a catcher , but his best was not good enough . They put him in the outfield , but the idea was abandoned when it became clear that he was in danger of skull fracture from fly balls . But York could play one position fairly well . He had been voted the most valuableplayer in the American Association in 1936 as Milwaukee 's first baseman . When Detroit fell into the second division in 1939 , the management believed its only salvation was to put York on first and stick Greenberg in the outfield . Greenberg hollered bloody murder and nobody blamed him . He was twenty-nine , an advanced age to tackle a new position . He asked : Suppose he was a hollow flop in the outfield and York was a sensation at first , what would that make him , except a chump without a job ? What would the management do , in that event , about his $30,000-a-year contract in 1941 ? Novice in the Pasture Walter 0 . Briggs , the automobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to induce Greenberg to play ball , but made no progress . Greenberg consented at last over the long-distance phone from Miami to Detroit , when Briggs promised to protect his salary , regardless of what happened . Still Greenberg was not happy . He reported at Lakeland , Florida , a week before training camp opened and went to work on the mysteries of left field with Coach Bing Miller . He complained that the linger glove , worn by outfielders , felt strange after using a first-baseman 's mitt all his life . He struggled with sun glasses , another new dodge . He had to unlearn the sidearm throw used in the infield arid perfect the long , overhand peg now demanded of him . Playing the opposite side of the field , he was bothered by the different angle at which the ball left the hat : he was plagued by the fear of looking ridiculous on fly balls . Greenberg groused constantly and improved steadily . Before the training trip was finished , he was giving a thoroughly workmanlike imitation of an honest-to-Speaker outfielder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no need to waste sympathy on the big guy out there . He was no worse than the runof-the-mine left fielder . Base runners did nut talce undue liberties with his arm ; he had the creditable number of fourteen assists . Hank was tortured by thoughts of the going-over the anvil chorus would give him when he muffed his first fly ball . Flank did not drop a really easy fly all season . True , he made more errors than any other outfielder in the league , but most of these came on silly throws to the infield , made , as he says , when he got bored arid wanted to feel he still was in the ball game . With Greenberg and York in the line-up , the Tigers had the most devastating one-two punch in baseball last year . Between them , they hit 74 homers and drove in 284 runs , ranking one-two in the league in this important department . Greenberg hit .340 and York .315 . In September , when the pennant pressure was on , the Jewislir Indian combination established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games . No man since the heyday of Ruth was such a vital factor in a team 's success as was Greenberg in the last twenty-four games , when Detroit wiped out Cleveland 's lead of three and a half games . In the rush to the wire , Greenberg hit .419 , drove in thirty-eight runs , walloped fifteen homers and made his thirty-six hits add up to ninety-one total bases . Greenberg is proud of his ability to drive a ball out of sight and mind . ire is the only man ever to hit a ball int-it the center-field bleachers at Comiskey the ward , where she was hailed with shouts of joy . This time she brought them little round , hard , brightly colored sweets that could be made to last a long time if you sucked them slowly . She fed them also a little Polish woman 's description of last night 's raid , which she had stood in the street to watch for them .

Just before she left she said , " There 's a man in a room , just there . His head 's all bandaged up . " Silence fell upon the ward . It was not an uncomfortable silence . It was a silence vital with the close-concealed affection of the British-born , streaked with uncontrollable currents of pride and loyalty and battle brotherhood . It was Legs , the Polish-American boy , who told her , That 's old J. G. " These delicate currents all but unnerved Miss Bronska as she entered J. G. 's room a moment later . She did not consider herself a brave woman , and she had to steel her sparrow-boned frame for a task she knew to he too big for her , but one that no one else seemed to he doing . When Miss Bronska faced a task that needed doing and that no one else seemed to he doing , she usually contrived to do it .

She was n't sure she had these , but she was used to forcing makeshifts into serving any moment 's need . " I believe I 've figured out a way for you to light your cigarettes without setting fire to your bandages , " she said to a figure stiffening rapidly into a black-out . How dared the woman force herself inside the private agony of his helplessness ? She took from her hag a single package of expensive cigarettes and set it on his knuckle-whitening fist . " If you 'll just put one in your mouth , " she suggested . The box slid off a fist which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke , " he offered shortly . " You need n't smoke it now , " she assured him , adding , " They 're rather better than the one I gave you last week . " Damn and blast the woman ! How dared she put him into the position of refusing her cigarettes because they were not good enough ? He considered ringing for the nurse and having her remove the pest . But one never rang for a nurse except in case of actual necessity . His right fist opened spasmodically , and a finger whacked against the box of cigarettes . It occurred to him that at least she 'd had the perception to let him extract his own cigarette . The nurse always took one from the brass box and poked it into his open mouth . It saved time , he presumed . But it did make him feel a fool .

" I expect I shall explain it badly , " she chirped , " hut if you would be so good as to try the experiment . I 've done it myself with my eyes tight shut with every cigarette I 've smoked the past week , It sounds rather silly , but it works . " It made his nerves crawl , the thought of some unknown female aping his helplessness . Damn and double damn her flaming impertinence ! " If you 'll just plant your two elbows tight against your sides and take hold of the far end of your cigarette with the thumb and forefinger of your left hand , keeping the remaining left-hand fingers stretched straight out ? " Despite his fierce disinclination , for the life of him he could not keep from doing as she said . But his taut nerves hummed like wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match between the thumb and forefinger of his clenched right hand . " Here 's a match . It 's lighted . Place the tip of the right-hand little finger hard against the tip of the left-hand little finger . " He began to shake all over . It was a shocking thing that a lighted match in a blind hand could do that to pulped nerves . He brought his little finger tips together and suddenly went still . He was astounded . He saw the thing at once . Saw that the match in his right thumb and forefinger had come miraculously in steady line with the tip of his cigarette . " It 's a sort of three-point lighting , " she chirped . " If you remember that during the whole maneuver you keep unmoved the two elbows and the joined tips of the little fingers . The left thumb and forefinger , holding the tip of the cigarette , give you the altitude of the match . Lower the match an inch or more , and bring it toward the cigarette until the flame begins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spread them wide , but do not move the little fingers . " It worked . Not since he had lifted his plane off the ground in his first solo flight had he known such devastating satisfaction . He could light his own Cigarettes . " If you 'll turn the lighted end of your cigarette inside your left hand and place the first knuckle of that hand against your chin , then place the big knuckle of your right thumb against your left-hand fingers , you can blow out the match without getting it near enough to endanger your bandages . " He obeyed with the smooth , sure ease of making a left bank . " There 's quite a large ash tray just where your right hand will come down onto the bed if you do n't move your elbow . " It was an ample ash tray . It had cost Miss Bronska her cheap cigarettes for three days . He moved it to his lap , keeping hold of it with his right hand . She watched him , turn the cigarette straight up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching fingers touched the right arm , then slide it forward and flick the ash accurately into the tray . The job was done . He would manage now , Then Miss Bronska wrote herself an irrevocable invitation to enter old J. G. 's room . She chirped , " I 'm so sorry . I 've let my cigarette go out . ( Actually , she 'd never lighted it . ) Could I trouble you for a light ? The // matches are three inches to the left of your right band . " " Juliana Bronska. " he assured her fervently , " nothing would give me greater pleasure than to give you a light . " Smoking together in silence , they became conscious that a raid was going on outside . The appalling shriek and grunt and wham of bombs was so near that they heard the following clatter and whang of masonry coming down . The dogged bark and chatter of guns was reassuring . He said , " They seem to have the range . " With all the pots and kettles thrown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , corning from Juliana Bronska , it sounded ridiculous . He laughed . And laughed again , because to laugh once more was like breathing air after a long stay under water . When she got up to go she said , " I expect there are going to he lots of amusing things you 'll work out for yourself , such as dropping your right hand straight down and bringing it up under the bedside table to get a starting point for reaching things on top . I 've put the cigarettes and matches four inches from the front corner of the Table . " " You 'll come again ? " " This day week , " she promised . She would have liked to come sooner . But she felt it was n't fair to take too much time off from the canteen . Besides , it would take six days of scaniping to save enough to buy a little treat for the boys in the ward and another box of goad cigarettes for J. G. She was even moved to regret that some of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have saved anything by going without meals she could n't have paid for did n't occur to her . Nor did it occur to her to come without a gift . She thought it was the unexpected that broke the monotony , and she knew there was nothing unexpected about the sight of the same little old Polish face . Miss Bronska did not present the cigarettes to J. G. when next she called . He answered her warning " Good afternoon " with a hearty " Come in . Come in . You 'll find the chair just there " ? pointing . " Sorry it 's not more comfortable . " He had , in fact , slipped out of bed fur the first time as soon as the nurse had tidied him up after lunch that day , had found the chair by fumbling about till he barked his shins against it , had learned , by sitting in it , just how hard it was , and had placed it beside the bed so accurately that he could point straight at it with assurance . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up gently against the bottom of the bedside table , reached up unwaveringly to grasp the small brass box on top , opened it , and presented it with pride . " You must allow me to be host today , " he said . Miss Bronska accepted a cigarette with pleasure . When he offered a lighted match , she touched a clawlike hand to his wrist to inform him as cigarette and flame made contact . She murmured " Thank you , " and smiled to see him build his fists against his chin to blow out the match without endangering his bandages . By the time of Miss Bronska 's next visit , the nurses were finding little to do for old J. G. He was making his own way to the showers ; was shaving with an electric razor such newly exposed bits of his face as the retreating bandages made available , and doing it without snarling the thing in the bandages . He was feeding himself with amazing . tidiness , and discussing the progress of the war with zest . There was just one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the ward to see his boys . He loved those boys . Loved them as only a man who has been a boy and knows the workings of a boy 's mind and heart and nerves could love the eaglets who had sat aloft with him , each a mechanized yolk in the silvered shell of the night , each poised to burl his own embryo of force against the full shock of steel-hatched death . The yearning to see them Misted his vitals . If he could have slipped into the ward at night and looked down upon each of them in his sleep , with time to check each one 's hurt and read each one 's answer to that hurt in the lines of his sleeping face , it would have been well . But to go fumbling in to them with no eyes to read what they would never tell , no guard against their pity or their horror of his blindness ? this , he felt , was more than he could face . His ears had told him that Miss Bronska visited the ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she opened the ward door to come and go . But she brought him no word of the ward . And he was grateful for her silence . They were his boys . No stranger could interpret them to him . Because it was so painful to think of his boys , he thought a great deal about Miss Bronska . Who was she , how did she look , whence had she dropped ? Judging by her manners and the faint and charming accent of her speech , she might be a young and lovely Russian countess . Judging by her intuition and her ageless wisdom , she might be a Greek oracle straying from an ancient dream . When she got up to go one day , he asked , " Would you mind telling me why you bothered about me ? " Miss Bronska had long ago placed this man . Having placed him , she did not anticipate his asking this question . Nor had she formed its answer in her conscious mind . She had to dig it up from under the surface as doggedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was quite prepared to have it explode in her hands . But it did not occur to her to offer an exploded shell when he had asked for the bomb . She was silent so long he feared she 'd gone without hearing the question . And when she spoke , her voice , for the first time , was strained . " I 'm afraid you 'll think me very impertinent . " He was startled and curiously stirred . To cover it he asked shortly , " Well ? " " I had to make you see . " It did explode , with him , in worse than death . God ! She had to make him see ! See what ? That he 'd been in a bloody funk , without the guts to save himself ? It was anger that saved him , good , cleansing rage against a meddling , gnat-brained female who imagined she 'd done him a service in teaching his hands to see to light a cigarette when all he wanted to see was his boys . And he had thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against her imagined image , futility cooled him . He 'd never see her . He 'd never see anyone . He 'd go on through life , presenting himself as a ghastly spectacle for the eyes of other people , without the revenge of seeing them . He was brought up short by the realization that she had never actually seen him . All she had seen was a man swathed up to his mouth in bedding and hospital gown and bandages , and down to his mouth in more bandages . Yet she knew him . After three minutes with bim she knew him to be a dead man , knew how to galvanize him into life even if she had seared him with the current . And he knew nothing about her . " God , " he groaned , " if I could only see her ! " Trying to analyze this sudden , almost penitent desire to see her , it came to him that he did know Juliana Bronska . Knew her with such a clear certainty that he could n't face it . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dim a light too bright to look upon . It was suddenly clear to him that this inner knowledge is the only vital knowledge . He saw that it is this toward which , and against which , men strive throughout their lives , and which they miss because their eyes are filled to blindness with externals . He was shy about seeing Miss Bronska again . He knew it would not be necessary to say to her those things no Englishman can say . But he shrank from the feeling of being spiritually unclothed before her . He 'd forgotten she was Polish . Had forgotten she might have been a Greek oracle straying from an ancient dream . She clothed him , at once , with confusion , because she came first to his room , and because there came with her the creak of a wheeled chair and the cheerful tinkle of bottles knocking together . It was only later that he learned the bottles held vodka . Miss Bronska liked vodka best , and she had the quaint habit of using as a gift only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had liked to take , now and then , a tiny glass of vodka " to warm her quivering stomach . " There were a half-dozen bottles , bought with her last ring , the one she 'd saved to bury her when the time came . But it was easy and inexpensive to he buried in England these days . Often the Huns did it for a dozen at a time with just a single bomb . A happier way to spend the jewel was in giving a party . " I thought the boys would like a party , " she chirped . " It 's a surprise . They do n't know you 're coming . . The chair 's six inches to your left . " He was shaken to his depths , His blind eyes burned with liquid fire . He was glad to he able to sit down in the wheeled chair . He knew why she 'd brought it . Knew he could have walked , but would have felt a fearful fool stumbling about the unfamiliar ward . He was going to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she set the basket in his lap . his hands caressed the smooth sides of the clinking bottles . " It is a party , " lie laughed . Miss Bronska was ao sparrow-small they did n't see her as she wheeled him through the ward door . Their astonished eyes saw only the beloved figure coming toward them , wearing the smile each had carried with him on his last flight . For an instant , the wave held poised . Then it broke in roaring triumph . The walking cases swarmed around him ; casts were strained and healing stumps were waved . As they unloosed the inevitable " For he 's a jolly good fellow , " Miss Bronska slipped away and down the stairs . Miss Bronska had given them the party .. And she had the quaint habit of using as gifts only the things she liked best .
