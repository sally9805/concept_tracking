In international broadcasts , the receiving country seldom helps to prepare the programs it receives , but five Brazilians last week reached Manhattan for just that purpose . Their chief object : to assist the Rockefeller Committee ( Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs ) in getting up a daily radio program for Brazil . <P> There are no commercial networks in Brazil . But eleven independent stations in Rio and eleven in Sao Paulo are linked by telephone wires , and all 89 Brazilian stations can pick up and rebroadcast programs transmitted over Brazil 's powerful short-wave stations . For years all stations have been required either to go off the air or to take the Government program , Hora do Brasil ( sometimes known among jesting Brasileiros as the Hora do Silencio ) . <P> Brazil 's Departamento de Imprensa e Propaganda ( D.I.P. ) , having allotted a part of the hour to a U.S. program beginning next Monday , accepted the Rockefeller Committee 's invitation to send advisers and writers to make the program hum in good Portuguese . Head of the delegation is Dr. Assis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will stay in the U.S. a few weeks . With him were the head of D.I.P . ' s radio division , Dr. Julio Barata , and three writers , Raymundo Magalhaes , Origines Lessa and Pompeu de Souza , all of whom brought their families and will stay a good long time , maybe a year . <P> One of the things that genial , low-voiced Dr. Barata has lately done for President Vargas is to forbid all foreign-language broadcasts in Brazil and to put an end to the use by Brazilian stations of all Axis news services . One of his worries has been clandestine radio communication between Axis agents on the Brazilian coast and German submarines at sea . A lesser worry has been short-wave propaganda from Berlin- telling Brazilians they are being taken into a war that is already lost . <P> This kind of thing , said Dr. Barata , does not go over big with Brazilians , who think that " a people who can produce a man like MacArthur can not lose a war .
