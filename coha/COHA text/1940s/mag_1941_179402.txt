In blacked-out London the pinch of milkless , eggless , fruitless days began to twist morals out of shape . While public morale rode high , by last week many a Londoner had relaxed his usually rigid code of personal honor sufficiently to treat Government war restrictions in much the same way that the mass of U.S. citizens treated Prohibition . It looked as though game-loving Britons were inclined to think that outwitting the Government was a sporting proposition . <P> Scotland Yard optimistically reported a 1% decrease in general crime over last year . But , as in the U.S. mass evasion of the unpopular Volstead Act , official figures were unreliable . Police have access only to cases where a complaint has been registered , a culprit booked . The chief evidence of character-loosening was conversation : Topic No. 1 ( the war ) had been pushed into the background by Topic No. 2 ( how to beat the rationing restrictions ) . <P> From peers to paupers the major chitsy-chatsy of Londoners was how they got fugitive eggs , lipstick , fruits , silk stockings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peer 's daughter triumphantly announced that she had persuaded her dressmaker to sell her a new suit without the required coupons . A politician 's wife proudly reported buying a fur coat ( 18 coupons ) with no coupons whatever ( she contended the garment was secondhand because it had been worn by a mannequin ) . <P> Black markets flourished in East End streets . Barrow merchants sold silk stockings ( probably stolen goods ) with only a pretense of accepting rationing coupons . Crates of oranges , strictly restricted to children , passed through a market speculator to his favored customers . Housewives evaded milk rationing by registering with two companies , thereby getting twice their legal share . <P> The " no-wrapping " order ( to save paper ) provided a brilliant opportunity for petty pilferers . Working in gangs-a man or children assisting a woman with a shopping bag-shoplifters raided lingerie , stocking and sweater counters . Scotland Yard reported a 25% increase in shoplifting . <P> " Curb crawlers " ( fences ) ferried stolen goods out to the suburbs , sold them , couponless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was offered a pony coat for 16 ( half the store price ) by a woman black-market agent who had about 20 fur coats in the back of her limousine . Other gangs thrived on door-to-door selling in apartment buildings . A laundry collector had a lively sideline in silk stockings . <P> Police got close to a ring of identity-card forgers who had set up shop in a bombed factory and printed thousands of false identity cards . The gang escaped , abandoning the presses . The black-printed , buff-colored cards had been sold to aliens and crooks for from 2 to 15 . <P> Some firms contracting to repair blitzed houses were found to be charging ten times fair prices . One contractor asked 50 for labor cost on a repair job for which the material cost only 3 . <P> An old soldier in Regent Street made a compromise with his ideals , hawked matches to blackout crowds at threepence a box . The boxes contained burned-out matches .                  @ @ @
