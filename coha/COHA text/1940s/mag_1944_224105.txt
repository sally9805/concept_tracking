No single decision by any man or group of men has set or will set the date for the Big Invasion . That date was set when the Allied command decided to invade , was and is being set , repeatedly , each time the commanders make decisions about the number of troops , the conditions of tide , the ammunition and oil stores , etc. that must exist before the attempt is made . <P> And the date will not be finally set until some day the meteorologists bring in a weather report and General Eisenhower says , " Tonight we move . " <P> Yet some of the most vital decisions and events that set the date are obviously in the making . In Britain last week : <P> A coastal strip ten miles deep and running all the way from The Wash , on the east coast , around to Land 's End , westernmost tip of England , was closed to civilian visitors ; even the local residents were forbidden to have binoculars . <P> Civil airmail service to continental Europe and Africa was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yachtsmen and other civilian boatmen ( many of whom helped to save the shattered B.E.F . at Dunkirk in 1940 ) to serve the Royal Navy " for short periods of duty during the next six months . " <P> All of this may not have signified much more than a bride 's beginning to buy her trousseau in expectation . A better indi cation may have been given by a seemingly platitudinous statement that pious , hard-hitting General Sir Bernard Law Montgomery gave to the press : <P> " The second front has already begun . It is going on now . We finished in Tunisia in the middle of May and then we began bombing Italy . When we thought the Italians were softened up enough , I invaded Sicily . While that was going on , we continued to bomb Italy . Then , when everything was ready , we invaded Italy and knocked her out of the war . Now we are bombing Germany-and how we are bombing her . It 's terrific . When Germany is sufficiently stunned , then we will invade . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more to do with overall military decisions about the second front than General MacArthur has to do with major U.S. strategy in the Pacific . But if his remarks could be taken at face value-if the invasion will come when Germany has been " sufficiently stunned " by bombing-then invasion is likely to be weeks away . For the bombers ' clear track to Berlin ( see p. 28 ) has only just been opened . The stunning is only about to begin .
