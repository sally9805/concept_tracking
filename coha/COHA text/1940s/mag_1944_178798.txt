One soldier traded a quart of Scotch for one of the first cucumbers from a new U.S. truck farm in the Pacific . But by last week U.S. soldiers and bluejackets were harvesting more fresh vegetables than they could eat , sending the ample surplus to their fighting comrades . First of its kind in the Central Pacific , the Guam garden is part of an expanding system of island farms ( already 5,000 acres ) which are producing every month more than 2,000 tons of tomatoes , cabbages , peppers , corn and other truck for the armed forces . <P> The project is classed as a Navy job , because it is in a Navy theater . But although most of the work is being done by servicemen , the credit for its success belongs mainly to a group of 25 civilian experts from the Foreign Economic Administration , who are headed by tall , weatherbeaten Knowles Ryerson . Starting from scratch little more than a year ago , Ryerson and his men have furnished enough seed , fertilizer , machinery , tools and sound advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency , despite obstacles that would make many farmers down tools . <P> The FEA men got their first sore sample of Pacific plowing on Efate , in the New Hebrides , where they planted their first seed . Thick virgin underbrush had to be uprooted , coral sand scraped away . But with the help of French prison labor , they were soon producing . Last Christmas the boys had 15,000 ears of sweet corn . <P> Bugs , Crabs , Volcanoes . On Guadalcanal they found the thick , heavy soil covered with high , knife-edged kangaroo grass , had to use bulldozers borrowed from the Seabees before they could even begin to plow . On Kolombangara , in the Solomons , they planted a former Jap airstrip of coral , already well stirred up by bombs . As they moved on again , they met new gardener 's curses : land crabs , wild pigs , volcanic ground that was hardly arable , odd varieties of scavenging bugs . But by the time they reached the Marianas , they had met and licked almost all the problems of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hot , jungle-lush islands is often far from rich , lacking especially nitrogen . G.I. farmers must use more than three times the normal amount of fertilizer , spooning it on a little at a time so that it will not all be washed away by the heavy rains . <P> To check the swarms of bugs , farms must be sprayed seven to ten times a year . Heavy tractors , which are hard to get , are invariably needed to work the fields . But to make up for all this trouble , everything else grows in three-fourths the time required in the U.S. At the seasonless equator , farms produce three to five crops a year . <P> Until recently , the farm project was confined to the South Pacific , where Ryerson and his 25 fieldmen also opened fisheries and started lumbering , by last spring were producing 250,000 board feet a day . But the program proved so satisfying that the Navy asked for the cultivation of 10,000 more acres in the Central Pacific as soon as the fighting moved on far enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to Japan .
