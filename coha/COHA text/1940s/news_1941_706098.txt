txt After New York 's third air-raid alarm in two days , at the height of the rush hour yesterday morning , military and civilian authorities announced that plans were being made to correct defects that have shown up in the system and to prevent unnecessary warnings hereafter . Improvement of the signal system so that the air-raid alarms can be clearly heard and sharply distinguished from ordinary police , fire and ambulance sirens also is being studied . As soon as possible , real air-raid sirens will be installed throughout the city . Plans for a practice blackout for New York City are being worked out , it was announced by Police Commissioner Valentine , but no date has been announced . Commenting on Governor Lehman 's order for immediate blackouts for all cities in the : State except New York , which is under separate jurisdiction , the commissioner said : " The matter is and has been receiving consideration , but it is impossible to state just when we will have a - practice blackout . " He added that Chief Inspector Louis F. Costuma had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gas and Electricity in order to set up controls of the lighting system during blackouts . " As everybody knows , " he explained , " this is a gigantic task . " Commissioner Valentine said the Police Department had treated the alarms seriously and had not considered them as " dress rehearsals . " He also announced that the department was making a survey to de : termine where air-raid sirens should be situated and what kind of equipment should be used . The city 's twenty-minute alarm yesterday morning occurred under the same conditions of official confusion as to its cause and of public calm bordering on indifference , as on Tuesday . The streets were full of people pouring out of subways and buses , and into office buildings and factories , but they kept right on about their business after a hasty glance at the sky . The alert was sounded at 8:41 o'clock , the all-clear at 9 01 . Long Island and North Jersey sections of the metropolitan area also had alarms . Suffolk County , which covers the eastern end of Long Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning at 5:53 A. M. They spread from there to Nassau County , then to Brooklyn and Queens , and finally to Manhattan . Newark and nearby New Jersey communities followed . In the suburban places , the chief criticism of their operation appeared to be the lack of a uniform system of signals , as they differed from place to place . Some Schools Dismiss Pupils In New York City some school children were dismissed from classes and sent home . Some returned to school after the all-clear , others waited until the afternoon session . In some outlying communities , where schools open later , students were turned back home on their way to school . Some commuters arrived in town on suburban trains without knowing there had been an alarm . In contrast to Tuesday 's alarms , which were officially attributed to a " phony " tip that enemy aircraft were approaching New York , yesterday 's alert was due to the mistake of taking Navy patrol planes for hostile or unidentified aircraft . The planes were spotted by the radio detectors of the First Interceptor Command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. , 150 miles out in the Atlantic , headed for Long Island . Before the aircraft could be identified , the Army notified the police of New York and Long Island of their approach , but when they came close enough to be sighted as American craft , the allclear signal went out . Although the police of all communities involved insisted they had received definite warning from the Army of an imminent enemy raid , making them responsible for passing it on to the public , Army officers said they had merely given the police a " preliminary " notice , intended for the private information of local authorities and air wardens , and not intended for the general public unless a definite alarm was issued later . They said they were not responsible if civilian officials decided to hold local tests of their air raid precautions . Signals Found Inadequate Aside from the lack of public excitement , the outstanding feature of yesterday 's alarm , as of Tuesday 's , was the inadequate nature of the Police and Fire Department sirens that sound the alerts and all-clears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New York City 's routine noises and are not heard by many persons , especially those indoors . Moreover , they are not suited to the type of signals given  --  alternating long and short blasts for the alert and continuous short blasts for the all-clear . The public had trouble distinguishing the alert signals from the ordinary sounds made by the sirens when Police and Fire Department vehicles and ambulances rush through the streets . Even some policemen on post in the Wall Street district said they had been unable to hear the alarm over the noise of the crowd in the street . They said the signals should be louder and completely distinctive . In Brooklyn , work continued at the Navy Yard , where it was said no official air raid alarm had been received but that anti-aircraft units were now on duty twentyfour hours a day anyhow . How City Police Functioned The Telegraph Bureau at New York Police Headquarters explained that it received yesterday 's warning by its special signal system from the Army 's Information Center on Defense , which has secret headquarters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received from the Army , Police Headquarters , at 8:39 o'clock , flashed Signal 50 on the police radio to all cruising police cars . This is a preliminary warning that unidentified planes are approaching the city . It calls for the police to notify all air raid wardens to man their stations and then continue about their usual duties , but to be ready for an alert . The real alert , Signal 51 , was flashed to the police radio cars at 8:41 . This is an action signal , meaning that an enemy air raid is imminent and that all police cars must turn on their sirens in . Nassau County police officials also differed with Army officials regarding yesterday morning 's alarm . They said they received the yellow signal from the First Interceptor Command  --  a preliminary warning to be on the alert  --  at 8:10 A. M. ; the blue signal  --  meaning enemy planes 40 minutes away ? at 8:24 ; the red signal-10 minutes away  --  at 8:37 , and the white  --  allclear  --  signal at 9:03 . According to Captain Lynn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headquarters of the First Air Force and the First Interceptor Command , only two signals were sent out  --  the yellow preliminary and the white all-clear . He said the warning was issued when planes were reported that could not be identified , and the allclear sounded when they were found to be Navy patrol planes . Among the changes planned to perfect the air raid warning system and eliminate unnecessary alarms , military authorities are understood to be planning a better system for the interchange of information between the Navy and the Army Information Center , to prevent a repetition of yesterday morning 's mistake . An Army Spokesman Explains Called in by Acting Mayor Newbold Morris , an Information Officer from Mitchel Field told reporters at City Hall that after the radio detectors had picked up the planes 150 miles at sea yesterday morning , no record could be found of any such flight by Army , Navy or civilians , although all flights were supposed to be reported to the Information Center . " We had to assume they were enemy planes , " he . added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitchel Field officer also said that the first alarm on Tuesday , resulting from a misunderstanding at Mitchel Field of a telephone inquiry from Governors Island , came about because the commanding officer at the field was obligated to sound at the field it- I self " a state of readiness alarm , " which might mean that a raid was imminent , that there was danger ' of sabotage or that there was a threat of the landing of troops . Until yesterday , he went on , thel regular procedure called for Mitchel Field under such circumstances to notify the Nassau County and Hempstead police . This was done on Tuesday , and the Nassau County police relayed the information by teletype to the New York police , who then verified it directly from Mitchel Field . Notice from Mitchel Field to the local police in Nassau County , ) which was termed " the snowball that made the avalanche , " has been discontinued as a result of what happened Tuesday . Hereafter the information center in New York will be the sole source of information to local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the alerts were " real and definitely not a test " as far as Mitchel Field and its personnel were concerned . " We want to make it clear that we were not testing the civilian population , " he added . " We were merely following out the procedure that has been laid down . Admittedly , this is still a little rough . We are improving our organization and putting a number of checks on it . We are not going to be fooled the same way again . " The officer explained that Tuesday 's second alarm was a mistake resulting from a fire or an air crash at Mitchel Field . Factory Whistles to Blow Fire Commissioner Patrick Walsh said that because many persons failed to hear the alarm sirens1 yesterday and Tuesday the Fire Department had obtained the cooperation of manufacturing plants equipped with whistles , which would join in sounding alarms after this . Sears , Roebuck &; Co. have volunteered to install a loud whistle on its store and warehouse in Flatbush . Mr. Walsh also said the department was working on plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no confusing an airraid warning with its regular fire alarm . A new system was also planned for La Guardia Field , which was caught without a warning system Tuesday because signals had not been devised to differentiate between an air raid and a fire . Tests were conducted between 1:30 and 2 P. M. yesterday , and it was decided to use a new alert signal at the field  --  one long blast followed by a series of short ones , to be repeated for five minutes  --  and an all-clear consisting of short blasts repeated several times . Major Edward G. Riekert , executive director of the Office of Civilian Defense for the Second Region ( New York , New Jersey and Delaware ) , announced changes in the system of air-raid alarms as handled by his office . Hitherto his office has been receiving notice of the warnings by radio and telephone from the secret headquarters of the Army 's Information Center for Defense in New York City . Henceforth he will have a signal board in his office in the Port Authority Building on which will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctive ring , for the different types of larms  --  yellow for the preliminary warning , blue meaning enemy planes forty minutes away , - red meaning ten minutes away and white meaning all-clear . Major Riekert then will notify the Mayor of New York City first , then the New York City Police Department , which already should have received the signal at Police Headquarters on its own signal board , and then the Governors of the three States by direct telephone wires . Beginning yesterday , he announced , his office has gone on a 24-hour basis . Despite the changes he instituted , he said he was greatly pleased with the way the warning system had operated and the calm reaction of the public . He requested the public not to telephone to his office , but to communicate with local police stations or Red Cross headquarters when wishing to offer services . Tuesday , he explained , there were 1,900 telephone calls to his office , jamming the switchboard and forcing the employment of extra operators .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
