ELMER A Story JOHN WATSON 0 UT in the country it ai n't like it is in the city . It seems like the land has a soul . It has a spirit , and the spirit of the land gets all mixed up with the spirit of the people and you ca n't sometimes tell which is which . If something bad happens to the land , it happens to the people too . Like the time old Colonel Humphrey Smoots died and all his tenant farms was sold to this big company or bank or something out East , the land quit producing . It looked like it just refused to put out anything unless the money was gain ' to stay right here in the county where the homefolks could get some enjoyment out of it . Nobody never held it against the Colonel that he owned their farms . They never held it against Elmer neither . Fact of the business , they liked the arrangement and they wanted it to stay that way . The Colonel and Elmer both offered to give them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they did n't believe in socialism . They offered to sell the land and let them pay for it a little ever ' year , but the folks just did n't want to own it . They did n't want to become capitalists , they wanted to stay tenant farmers like Godamighty made them . Well , as I was fixin ' to tell you , a wrong was done to old Colonel Smoots and the land rebelled . Because it was a wrong to the land also , and to her people . I guess if all that big bunch of money that was madeoff of the land had been took back out East , Washington 's Bend would be as barren today as the Sahara Desert , and more people would of died than did . For forty-five years Colonel Smoots spent ever ' dime he could rake and scrape buyin ' up farms , because he seen what the landlords was doin ' to the people , and I guess if he had n't fell in love he would of owned the whole state of Texas by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday evenin ' and hunt him up and beg him to buy the farm they was on , because ever'body liked him . He give ever ' - body a square deal and then some . But as I was sayin ' , the trouble all begun when the Colonel fell in love . He figured he had spent sixty-five years of his life workin ' , excusin ' them few years before he was old enough to drag a cotton sack , and he was entitled to set back and enjoy life a while . Anyhow , he had done met this Ladybird Hickson and he had set his cap to marry her . I seen Miss Ladybird a time or two and then seen her again at the funeral , and I ca n't say much for the Colonel 's taste in women . Nobody seemed to know where she come from , but she sure God was n't no native . Chaparral County has produced some queer ducks , but not none like Miss Ladybird . Well , anyhow , she had come to the Bend to visit kinfolks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious thought to the hereafter . Because her bein ' forty-eight years old and still a maid , I guess she figured it was high time she begun to think about swappin ' her beauty or virginity or whatever she had to give in exchange for a rich husband that would n't live long enough to clutter up the house with parts of mowin ' machines and muddy overalls . So the Colonel married her . And ever ' tenant farmer that was rentin ' land from him crossed their fingers , because they knowed the Colonel 's money was all tied up in land and mules and plows . They knowed somebody was goin ' to get sold down the river because Miss Ladybird had n't married plumb entirely for love , she wanted a little spendin ' money . Well sure enough , they was n't hardly two months ' time betwixt the weddin ' and the funeral . Some folks suspected foul play , but there was n't no way to prove it . Others that claimed to know more about that sort of thing said it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral man like the Colonel that has n't done no tomcattin ' around in all them sixty-five years and you throw a package like Miss Ladybird in his lap that has n't done nothin ' in all them forty-eight years but study about her honeymoon . Anyhow she put him away nice , and I guess he had the biggest turnout for his funeral in the history of Chaparral County . M RS . LADYBIRD HICKSON SMOOTS did n't hardly wait till the dirt got dry out in the peach orchard where she planted the Colonel till she sold the first farm to the Yankees . Some folks said the lawyer from Austin that was handlin ' their business was at the funeral . But I do n't know , might of been just talk . You know how the womenfolks is . Anyhow , after that she averaged about a farm a day till she had done sold out lock , stock , and barrel to this bunch out East . That is , ever'thing except the Colonel 's old home place . For some reason or other Ncw York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Widow Smoots kept on hang-in ' around tryin ' to find a buyer for the place so she could get the last red cent in movable form and put it in her satchel and clear out . It 's a mystery to me how the womenfolks finds out these things , butanyhow ever'body knowed that Ladybird intended to take all that big bunch of money and go to New York . I do n't know why so many birds is born with that kind of a hankerin ' . Looks like they hatch out with that one idea in their head , to go huntin ' down in Texas and suck the blood out of some part of the country or people , and go out East and set in a pen house and sip that blood . Anyhow , Ladybird 's longin ' for that last red cent was her undoin ' , because while she was nosin ' around over in town lookin ' for a sucker to buy the place , she run into Elmer . Well , the Widow took one look at Elmer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crummy old buzzard like the Colonel ai n't enough . What fun would it be to set in that pen house and sip champagne if you ai n't got a handsome young man to jostle on your knee ? Ever'body in the Bend knowed Elmer Doolittle . Liked him a heap , too . Ever ' - body in the county , for that matter , knowed the vital statistics on Elmer . He was the best lookin ' man in the neighborhood and he was thirty-six years old . Would of got married half a dozen times to Margery Adams if it had been left up to her . But old man Adams always put his foot down as soon as it begun to look serious because nobody never had knowed Elmer to do a lick of work , and tenant farmers in the Bend was n't in the habit of supportin ' their son-in-laws . But as I was sayin ' , the Widow seen Elmer and her pulse ris a notch or two . He knowed who she was because when he heard about the Colonel 's death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high lonesome and went to the funeral . He seen the Widow standin ' by the grave , and him bein ' slightly illuminated , he thought she was n't as homely as most folks made out she was . So Elmer kinda took it slow and easy and made his way over to his grandpa 's grave and set down on it and wept a little and took out his pencil and figured it all out on the old man 's tombstone . As near as he could calculate , the Widow was worth somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred thousand dollars . I do n't know if Elmer deliberately put hisself in the Widow 's line of vision that day in town or not . Maybe he did n't even know she was nearsighted , maybe he just happened to be there . But anyhow , she seen him and she flirted with him . That was on a Tuesday , three or four weeks after the funeral . Well , things rocked along that way awhile , her tryin ' to warm up to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she had been his own grandma . So it rocked along like that till it come a Saturday night . Elmer happened to be down town and happened to take a drink or two with the boys and felt in his pocket and found out he was broke . That was when he borrowed a couple of dollars and bought a bottle and throwed precaution to the winds and went over and married the Widow . It did n't take long to transact the deal , because she had done already got the license . The way things fell out , it looked like the hand of Godamighty had been laid on Elmer 's shoulder and him chosen to do a job of work for the Lord . W HEN the tenants heard about the marriage , their hopes ris a little . But not much , because they knowed the Widow Smoots was n't goin ' to let Elmer get his hands on that money . They just set around and waited and maybe prayed a little . They was n't no work to do much , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two three days ' honeymoon at the hotel , Ladybird popped out on the street again lookin ' for a buyer , because she really had ants in her pants now to get them last few dollars and hightail it to New York , In the meantime Elmer snuck off out to the farm and begun to smell around for that money . He looked under the barn , up the chimney , in the clock , behind the pictures , and finally down the well . When Elmer pulled his shoes off and went down in the well , he found that bottle of rat poison . He knowed then what had happened , that the Widow had shoved the stopper in good and tight and throwed it down the well where nobody would n't think of lookin ' for it . When Ladybird come in that evenin ' to eat supper that the nigger cook had fixed , Elmer was done already settin'the table . And the first thing she seen was that bottle of rat poison with the label turned around so the skull and crossbones was kinda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea . Well , Ladybird did n't say nothin ' , She did n't eat nothin ' neither , and she did n't drink no tea . So it rocked on that way for a week or such matter and the farm still had n't been sold . The word had got around over the county that as soon as she disposed of the place she was takin ' them two hundred thousand dollars out of the state . They would n't nobody in Texas buy the farm under them conditions , And besides they did n't nobody want a little piece of Texas that close to a big hunk of New York . Anyhow , that bottle of rat poison was still settin ' there on the table and Mrs. Ladybird Hickson Smoots Doolittle had n't took no nourishment and she had n't got no sleep . I do n't know how long she would of lasted , maybe a month or more , because she was as tough as a pine knot . But when she looked out the window and seen the sheriff and that stranger comin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Master 's call . The sheriff seen what the score was when he come in the door . Ladybird had done turned white around the gills and she was frothin ' at the mouth . So the sheriff just walked over and put the stopper back in the bottle and said , " Mrs. Doolittle , this here gentleman has come to buy your place . " Well , you would n't believe it , but I was there and seen it myself . They was more folks turned out for Ladybird 's funeral than they was for the Colonel 's . Elmer really put her away nice , I 'll say that much for him . He had n't lived with her long enough to really become attached to her , but anyhow he rubbed a onion on his handkerchief and wiped his eyes and wept a little . All of which was a sin in the sight of God because he had done already fell in love with this radio girl . Folks talked a good deal at the funeral about what the Widow Smoots had died of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention the rat poison , and Elmer had just shoved the stopper in good and rind-led off the outside and put the bottle back in the well : So there was n't nobody but Elmer and the sheriff that knowed the Widow had sent the Colonel and herself along to glory . Most of the folks agreed that Elmer was too much of a man for the Widow . Elmer was a native and he was a powerful romantic man . So the coroner returned the verdict , death from natural causes . And that seemed to please ever'body . B UT as I was fixin ' to tell you , Elmer had a few simple faults like most good honest folks has . One of them was a mild-mannered objection to bein ' caught in the neighborhood of where a piece of work was about to begin to be done . And another was a kind of a lonesome longin ' ever ' once in a while to wet his whistle with a tumblerful of good drinkin ' liquor . But what really tied a knot in Elmer 's tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he heard that baby-faced Voice on the radio he fell in love with it . Of course , nobody knowed at the time , but that was what made Elmer schedule the funeral in the middle of the day . Folks was a little bit annoyed to have to jump up from the dinner table and run out to the orchard that way pickin ' their teeth , and it bein ' Sunday too so they could n't start eatin ' early on account of church services . But Elmer had done made up his mind he was n't goin ' to take no chance on missin ' that radio program at three o'clock . Well , the more Elmer heard that woman sing over the radio the more he knowed that the foot of Fate had stepped into his life . He was willin ' to be decent about it and wait till his first wife had got comfortably settled down out in the peach orchard beside her first husband before he married his second wife . But he swore he was goin ' to marry her , he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a home-made mud fence . Anyhow , Elmer wrote a letter and sent his picture to this Voice in care of the radio station at Austin . He just casually mentioned the money without referrin ' to how unnegotiable it was at present , because he knowed the Widow had it stuck away in a crack somewhere and he knowed he was goin ' to find it . I do n't know whether it was the picture or the money that done it , but Elmer got a invitation to Austin and he went up there and married that twenty-six-year-old Voice . He got the whole woman along with it because that was in the deal too . w ELL , Miss Saphronie Ponder , that bein ' the name of Elmer 's new bride , was about as common a lookin ' piece of humanity as you will find in a month of Sundays bumpin ' around in the backwoods of Texas . At first it almost knocked the bucket out from under her when she learned that the money was not in the bank . Elmer told her he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewheres out there in the Colorado River bottom . But pretty soon she perked up and begun to flit around as happy as a lark . Seemed like after she got used to the notion , it really pleased the hang out of her . Because Miss Saphronie had it all figured out how she was goin ' to find that money . I do n't know how the word got out . but her bein ' a woman that liked to talk as well as sing , and all the other women in the neighborhood not havin ' nothin ' to do but listen since the cows had done already dried up and the chickens was n't layin ' no eggs , it leaked out . She had borrowed a little chicken feed from her brother in Austin and bought two tickets on the plane to New York . Folks said it was awful decent of her to take Elmer along , Of course she could n't leave until she had found the dowry that was buried . But she did n't have no notion of hangin ' around tryin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't greedy , I 'll say that much for her . Two hundred thousand was a plenty . She knowed she had a good voice , but she had gumption enough not to overrate that clock stopper of her'n . Well , as I was sayin ' , it kinda pleased Miss Saphronie to learn that Elmer did n't know where the money was , because she knowed her brother had a foolproof method of finding it . And that way Elmer would have to go with her to New York if he did n't want to get separated from his money . Folks in the Bend was becomin ' holler-eyed by that time . This here New York outfit that owned their farms had done already cut ever'body off at the grocery store because the crops was goin ' to pot and nobody would n't be able to pay . It looked like the land was becomin ' more rebellious ever ' day . And that was why all the tenants was so sure Saphronie never would find the money , because the land had it hid and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they did n't know nothin ' yet about these newfangled ideas that Dr. Archibald P. Ponder had learned in school out East . They did n't know about them underhanded scientific methods of trickin ' the land into revealin ' its secrets . Miss Saphronic was impatient to get that money and set sail for the East , but Elmer was a powerful handsome man and she was n't passin ' up no opportunities . So she just relaxed and spent a couple of weeks or so lettin ' him listen to her sing at night when he could hear but could n't see . And she spent the days helpin ' him hunt for her dowry . Well , by the time she took him to the hospital Elmer had done already give up all hopes of ever findin ' that money . They had looked ever'whcrc on topside of earth and they had n't found a cryin ' dime . He knowed he 'd die a pauper before he 'd start diggin ' up all them sixty-three acres of dirt . That fool Ladybird might of buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a post-hole digger . So he did n't offer no protest when she took him to Austin to the hospital , but he knowed he was n't sick . He did n't have nothin ' wrong with him but a little bit of a thirst , and a tumblerful of good drinkin ' liquor would cure that . N YHOW , they went on up to Saphronie 's brother 's psychoanalyzing office , and right off the bat the doctor had him lay down on the couch and close his eyes . He took a notebook off of the desk and read to Elmer for about fifteen minutes , all about what had happened since the day he married Mrs. Ladybird Smoots . Elmer was surprised because he did n't know how the doctor had got all them statistics , but he did n't say nothin ' . After a while the doctor closed the notebook and asked Elmer what did he dream last night . " Not nothin ' as 1 remember , " said Elmer . " How about the night before ? " said the doctor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . ' t had no dreams in God knows when . Not since I married the first time . " The doctor looked in a drawer and took out two pictures , one of Ladybird and one of Saphronie . He handed them to Elmer and told him to open his eyes . " Are these your two wives ? " he said . Elmer looked and then closed his eyes again . He said they was . The doctor looked at the pictures his-self and then put them back in the drawer . " No wonder you never had no dreams , " he said . " You never had nothin ' to dream about . " So he took Elmer in another room and put him to bed and told him to stay all night and try to dream . Then he went over and borrowed a good-lookin ' nurse from another doctor and brought her back to set up with Elmer and take his temperature ever ' hour . Well , Elmer never had been psychoanalyzed before and he did n't know what the hell it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it some way or other and he decided to keep one eye open and see what was gain ' to happen . Anyhow , he knowed he was n't goin ' to sleep yet awhile because they would n't Let him have no nightcap . This here good-lookin ' blonde come in with a thermometer and set down where Elmer could get a good view of her and opened a magazine and begun to read to herself . Ever ' hour she got up and took his temperature and wrote it down  --  on a piece of pasteboard . It rocked along that way till . past midnight and the nurse seen that Elmer still did n't have no fever and he still had n't went to sleep . So along about two o'clock in the mornin ' she got up and went and got a magazine for Elmer , thinkin ' maybe he would read hisself to sleep . And that 's where she throwed a monkey wrench in the doctor 's washin ' machine . Because the name of the magazine was Psychiatry , and Elmer found a story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out what the score was . The next morning Elmer had breakfast in bed , and after a while the doctor come waltzin ' in with his notebook and fountain pen . He set down by the bed and asked Elmer what did he dream last night . He seemed awfully pleased over the dream that Elmer told him and he wrote it down in his notebook , all about Ladybird stand-in ' out in the middle of the cotton patch with a post-hole digger and the bag of money . Of course Elmer made up the whole story . He had n't dreamed it no more than I had . Elmer thought he was goin ' to trick Archibald and Saphronie into diggin ' up them sixty-three acres of dirt , but he had n't read enough psychiatry yet . Because he did n't know that a post hole in a dream might represent something else in actual life  --  maybe a well , for instance . If he had knowed it , he would of studied up a different kind of a dream . Anyhow they made Elmer stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the farm to get that money . But when the doctor come up out of the well he did n't have no money  --  nothin ' but that bottle of rat poison . E LMER was disappointed when Archibald come back that evenin ' and told him to get out of bed and go home . He knowed they had n't found the money because the doctor was in a bad humor . He just glared at Elmer and wrote out a statement that Elmer was insane and stamped his affidavit on it and sent it over to be put on file in the Chaparral County Court House . Well , Elmer was a little confused and his feelin 's was hurt , but he still wanted to find out if that man in the magazine knowed what he was talkin ' about . So he went on back out to the Bend , and that 's when he found the bottle of rat poison settin ' on the table again . ft looked like to Elmer they was some-thin ' strange about that rat poison , it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of it in a cut-glass wine decanter with about a half a teacupful of sherry to give it a nice color and set it up on the mantelpiece . Then he rinched out the bottle good with hot water and put a little apple brandy in it , thinkin ' maybe the bottlewould n't mind stayin ' out of sight with that in it , and set it up in the cubbard . Elmer went on down to the store to have a little snort with the boys and that 's when he run into old Dad Inge . It was Dad that told him how a combination of beer with a coffee chaser always made him have nightmares . That pleased the hell out of Elmer , because he had done decided to do a little dreamin ' on his own and see if the psychiatry man knowed his onions . Well , sure enough it worked . By the time he had drunk ten or twelve bottles of beer and eight or ten cups of coffee , every farmer in the Bend had come down to the store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' imbibin ' beer and coffee , for they knowed he was a liquordrinkin ' man . So along about a hour by sun they laid Elmer out on a pool table and he went to sleep and had the nightmare . The farmers let him kick and scratch and grunt awhile until they figured the dream would be over , and then they woke him up . Elmer rubbed his eyes and looked around and said , " Boys , go git a spade , I think we got it . " So they all went on out to old Colonel Smoots 's place , and ever ' man had a grubbin ' hoe or a shovel . On the way Elmer explained how he had psychoanalyzed hisself . According to the man in the magazine , this is the way he had it figured out . Ladybird had talked about the rosebush in her sleep . Elmer had heard her but he had n't woke up , so the information had went into his subconscious mind . And the first time he dreamed , out it popped . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on out and watched him dig up the rosebush that the dream said Ladybird had planted . And sure enough , there was the tin box with the money in it . Well Elmer was n't takin ' no chances on lettin ' that money get away from hint . He knowed that him and the boys was goin ' to celebrate , so he went over to Oakville and hunted up old man Bilers , president of the bank , and left the tin box with him . He kept just that one twenty dollar bill to buy some drinkin ' liquor to rinch out his mouth , because by this time them coffee cocktails had begun to kinda curdle , and his mouth tasted like the bottom of a birdcage . After they had drunk a few toasts down at the store , Elmer bid adieu to the boys and went on back home . And when he got there he found out that Saphronie was in the mood to celebrate too . Shc heard him furnblin ' around out on the gallery , and when he come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archibald P. Ponder come down the next day with the sheriff from Austin and a battery of lawyers to have Elmer indicted for murder . But the Chaparral County Court House folks did n't get their pulse beats up none . They just got out the records and showed them that Elmer had done been declared insane , and they would n't arrest him . Anyhow , they was n't no evidence , because Elmer had took the rat poison bottle out and buried it in the peach orchard between Colonel Smoots and Ladybird . The bottle was empty , because Saphronie had fed all the applejack in it to Elmer . S o ELME.R washed out the wine decanter , because it was empty too , and set it back up on the mantelpiece . Of course , he cried and took on considerable over the death of his second wife . But it was like Elmer said , if a woman did n't have no more taste in her mouth than to drink a teacupful of half-an ' - half sherry and rat poison , she did n't have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Elmer did n't know whether he ought to bury Saphronie in the orchard or not , because it looked like , pretty soon they was goin ' to be more people out there than peaches . But still an ' all , there was that rat poison to be reckoned with . It had set up there in the Colonel 's cub-bard for thirty-odd years until it had developed a kind of a unity or somethin ' . It did n't like to be separated . So Elmer hired a nigger to dig another hole , because when he dug up the rosebush his diggin ' days was done . And he laid the body to rest , which brought all the rat poison back together again under that one tree  --  about a third in the Colonel anda third in Ladybird and the rest in Saphronic . The bottle was there too , so it ought not to cause no more trouble . Well , the folks in the Bend went to Saphronie 's funeral and wept , but their hearts was n't in it . Because Elmer had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sleep the night before and let the cat out of the bag . His wife was awake , so she did n't have to bother about usin ' any modern scientific methods to get the information out of her subconscious mind . She just woke up her husband and pumped the details out of him about how Ladybird had poisoned the Colonel and herself and how Saphronie had got the drinks mixed up and hastened her own premature departure for the Promised Land . Anyhow , old man Adams put his foot down and told Margery and Elmer they would have to wait awhile . He had knowed all the time it was goin ' to happen , because marriages is made in Heaven . Sometimes Godamighty has a special piece of work to do and he lays his hand on the shoulder of some man in the neighborhood that has got the qualifications for the job . Like Elmer , for instance . They was n't no other man in the county handsome enough to hook the Widow Smoots . Sometimes a man has a little chore to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on livin ' a normal life and raisin ' a family . w ALL , as I was fixin ' to tell you , that lawyer from Austin was campin ' in Elmer 's tracks . This outfit in the East was sick of their trade because somethin ' had happened to the land and they was ready to dump it in somebody 's lap at a loss . Elmer pretended he was n't interested until the man gut the price down where it suited him and he bought all them tenant farms back . After a week or two old man Adams begun to shift his sails a little , because Elmer had him fooled too . He was pretendin ' that he had done already lost interest in Margery . The old man decided maybe they better not wait too long , because he knowed Elmer always had wanted to marry his daughter and visa versa . And as long as marriages is made in Heaven and no mortal man ca n't prevent them but only delay them a spell , he withdrew his objections , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite growed up and settled down , and he did n't want to support him . Well , you never seen such frolickin ' and carryin ' on in all your born days as there was at Elmer and Margery 's weddin ' . Of course , Elmer wanted to he decent about it , so he waited till his second wife had got comfortably settled down out there in the peach orchard beside his first wife and her first husband before he married his third wife . But the money was all back inthe land again where it had come from . and ever'body was happy . During the next year that land produced so much stuff it just kinda piled up at the county line and bubbled over . The folks gethered so much of it and they was still so much left until they just finally quit right in the big middle of the harvest and thro wed a celebration . That was the night after Elmer and Margery 's boy was born . The people knowed then the farms was safe , because they was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lap of the land .
