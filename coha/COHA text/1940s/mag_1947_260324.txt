The Private Affairs of Bel Ami ( Loew-Lewin ; United Artists ) is the latest example of Albert Lewin 's passion for bringing musky literary classics to the screen . Writer-Director Lewin is responsible for movie versions of Maugham 's The Moon &; Sixpence and Wilde 's The Picture of Dorian Gray . His adaptation of Maupassant 's coldly sardonic novel Bel Ami is his smoothest job to date . But it also clearly defines the limitations of Mr. Lewin 's kind of movie art . <P> A caption warns the audience , straight off : " This is the story of a scoundrel " - i.e. , he is not to be mistaken for a human being . Georges Duroy ( George Sanders ) - Bel Ami to his lady friends-is a scoundrel , at the very least . Starting all but penniless , he climbs aboard Journalist John Carradine 's friendship ; charms Carradine 's brainy wife ( Ann Dvorak ) into working for him ; draws her widowed friend ( Angela Lansbury ) into a hopeless infatuation ; sets a publisher 's virtuous wife ( Katherine Emery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virginal love of her daughter ( Susan Douglas ) ; makes a pass ( unsuccessful ) at devout Frances Dee ; contracts a convenience marriage with Widow Dvorak over the scarcely cold body of her husband ; frames her with Diplomat Warren William in order to be free to marry little Miss Douglas ; buys a title and , ultimately , gets killed in a duel . <P> Maupassant 's novel was a relentless demonstration of what a thoroughly corrupt man can do to get ahead in a thoroughly corrupt society . Its cynical moral : sufficient vice usually succeeds and goes unpunished , whereas halfhearted vice - like virtue - is likely to enjoy less spectacular rewards . Mr. Lewin 's modification : vice generally gets too smart for its own good . George Sanders , who starred in both of Lewin 's previous pictures and is a sort of staff Lothario , by now does this kind of work very efficiently . The supporting cast is competent and the picture is lovingly made and handsomely mounted . <P> But really good movies , like really good literature , are never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly polished posturings . Director Lewin also sets himself the impossible task of trying to clean up a naughty story for the family trade . Because adultery is taboo to Hollywood 's censors , Angela Lansbury is represented as a widow and Mr. Sanders does not take up with Miss Dvorak until she is a widow too . An old gentleman who was unmistakably Miss Dvorak 's lover in the book is presented in film as a dear old friend of the family . A part which Maupassant thought of as a very shady lady ( prostitute , except in Hollywood ) , is played by Marie Wilson , who is identified as " a dancer . " <P> Writer-Director Lewin reportedly contents himself with the assurance that those who are smart enough can still see , in spite of such subterfuges , everything that Maupassant really meant . Those who are smart enough for keyhole-peeping , and no smarter , will doubtless enjoy it .
