A struggle to decide the economic shape of Europe is building up . One of the open ing skirmishes was fought last week when eight leading representatives of OEEC ( Organization for European Economic Cooperation ) met in Paris . The engagement was screened by a fog of long technical words and its result was inconclusive . When the meeting ended , however , the advantage lay with Britain 's Sir Stafford Cripps . He had skillfully checked a drive by ECA and some continental nations to reduce currency exchange barriers between European nations . <P> The struggle would continue . Its issues , little understood in the U.S. , might turn out to be more important than anything on which the Big Four Foreign Ministers might agree . Europe 's political future and its military defense were closely tied up with its economic prospects . Would Europe develop toward a great unified area of free trade ? Or would each nation protect itself with barriers which would strengthen the parts but weaken the whole ? <P> Stultifying ? On the eve of last week 's Paris conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... Success of the ECA program would be impossible in a system made up of small , autarchic , uneconomic national trading units , each one dedicated to self-defeating self-sufficiency , each one standing off his neighbor with ingeniously stultifying restrictions . " <P> From ECA 's very beginning this proposition had been recognized-in theory . But in its first year , ECA , faced with an emergency , tended to the opposite direction . ECA sometimes stimulated fast production in a way that worked against future European economic unity and overall efficiency . Example : before the war , The Netherlands made heavy purchases from Belgium 's big railway equipment industry . Today , the Belgians do not want to trade with The Netherlands because the Dutch can pay them only guilders , not now convertible to dollars . Like everyone else in Europe , the Belgians want dollars to buy in the U.S. So the Dutch are building their own railway equipment industry just across the Belgian border . They are using Marshall Plan dollars to duplicate a Belgian industry which ought to have a Dutch market . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders of many continental nations are blaming Britain for working against a unified Europe . They attribute this partly to its Labor government 's love of planning , with the controls and restrictions that planning brings . <P> Continentals call this tendency " dirigisme " it is increasingly unpopular on the Continent . The French , Italians and even the sober Belgians consider the British taste for controlled austerity to be somewhat perverted-what might be called economic masochism , or love of suffering . The British look down their noses and reply that their controls are merely good housekeeping . <P> Against that background the OEEC group met last week in Paris . Their assignment was to renew or to change the Intra-European Payments agreement , which runs out this month . Britain 's objective was to make the new plan as much like the old as possible . Belgium 's Paul-Henri Spaak and French Finance Minister Maurice Petsche were expected to carry the ball for the liberal Harriman position .
