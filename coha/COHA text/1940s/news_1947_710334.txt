Austin told the Security Council today that the Vandenberg amendment , which gives the United Nations power to halt the $400,000,000 GreekTurkish aid program , was proof that the Government and the people of the United States had the " firm determination " to uphold the world organization . The Truman proposals were bitterly attacked by Dr. Oscar Lange , Polish representative , who asserted that they constituted military intervention in Greece . If ' the United States suspects that the Soviet Union is threatening the independence of Greece , he asked ; why does it not ask for an explanation by the Soviet repxesentative in the Security- Council . lt , p Although the United States repientitive accused Andrei A. Gromyko , Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister , of inconsistency , he did not directly oppose the Soviet proposal to establish a United Nations mission to supervise the United , States economic program for Greece . Instead he called for immediate action on his resolution directing the Balkan investigating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Council acts on its report . The next step should be further general discussion of the Truman proposals , he said , but the Council should delays consideration of the Soviet proposal until Congress has authorized the United States program and until agreements between the // United States and the Greek and Turkish Governments have been concluded . Vassili Dendramis , Greek representative , charged that the Soviet proposal was intended to cast discretit on his country and to encourage and strengthen " those disloyal minorities in Greece who , actively aided by some of the supporters of the proposal , are still trying to undermine and destroy a democratic system in favor of a Communist dictatorship . " The Truman proposals are still not on the agenda of the Security Council , but at the request of the United States , the Council is considering the Greek charges against Albania , Yugoslavia and Bulgaria that resulted in the establishment of the Balkan investigating commission . With four other members still on the speakers ' list , the Council adjourned until 10:30 A. M. ? Monday , since tomorrow is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who spoke before the Senate had accepted the Vandenberg amendment , upheld the procedure of the United States In not notifying the United Nations of the Truman proposals at the time they were submitted to Congress . He said that until Congress had acted it was " quite impossible " for anyone to predict exactly what form the aid to Greece and Turkey might take , and that he assumed that no United Nations agency would wish to take any action based upon " mere supposition . " Denying Mr. Gromyko 's charge that his speech on March 28 , sixteen days after the President 's message to Congress , was notice " post factum , " Mr. Austin said the proposals were not " factum " until they had been approved by Congress .

He suggested that the United States ask both Mr. Gromyko and Sir Alexander Cadogan , the representative of Great Britain . Referring to a statement by former Governor George M. Earle of Pennsylvania before the House Committee on Un-American Activities , who proposed that the United States drop atomic bombs on the Soviet Union , Dr. Lange said that " with all due respect " he did not consider this exactly helpful to the creation of confidence and understanding . In his statement Mr. Dendramis repeated his earlier charges that Yugoslavia , Albania and Bulgaria were organizing and providing arms for the " so-called guerrillas , " who , he said , were murdering and pillaging industrious and law-abiding citizens . Replying to Dr. Lange , he read a Moscow communique of last March announcing the grant of credits to Poland and agreement in principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
