Diverse elements have gone into the making of Tom Stoppard 's Night and Day ( Anta Theatre ) but they do not give it real coherence . Its " novelty " is that it is the first exDecember 15 , 1979 ample in its author 's work of more or less traditionally plotted drama . There still remain characteristic pasSages of improvisational playfulness and fancy . In this case they relate to Ruth Carson 's ( the " leading lady 's " ) inner monologue and daydreams . For example , she imagines a consummated flirtation with a youth she has almost just met , attracted to-him by his good looks and idealism . Married to a man who owns a mine guarded by the dictator of an African country and threatened by a leftist rebellion , Ruth Carson is given the opportunity to say many amusing things ( often only in her mind ) abput herself , this , central situation and the various personages involved in it . She despises the popular press and the reporters who feed it too often indiscriminately with trivia and grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned with either but out of a display of vanity in hunting down headline-making stories . This is one of the play 's points , the rebuttal to which , delivered by a cockney news photographer , is that the information provided by the press , despite all the skulduggery which may be involved in unearthing it , is invaluable to a democracy : " It brings light . " That , if anything , is the play 's thesis . In itself , it may be valid , but it is ' - , not dramatized ; it is merely stated . In the same way , Ruth Carson , though she serves as a critic of the press  --  which is , by the way , rarely " free , " because it is usually in the possession of millionaires who protect their own interests in economic , political and social confrontations  --  is more a decorative and entertaining adjunct to the play than crucial to it . Much of the play 's argument revolves around the two news gatherers , a seasoned and cynical reporter and a younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , government and social justice . In addition to these , we are given a portrait of the African dictator , who is financed by certain British capitalists and thus protects Mr. Carson 's mine , which would be confiscated by the rebels , were they successful . These various strands are patched together rather than made integral to a dramatically convincing whole . What keeps the play going is Stoppard 's elegantly fluent and sometimes sparkling writing . This is especially true because Mrs. Carson is played by Maggie Smith , the most skillful actress in all English-speaking comedy . Easy and The Nation . always on target , she is above all endowed with a capacity to think funny . The most casual lines she utters , the least ? gesture she makes take on humorous content . She is the body of wit . A slight nasality of delivery adds to a tone of subtle derision which creates a " distance " between herself and those she addresses . She has had much better roles ( in this play , I repeat , her character stands somewhat apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a delight to see and listen , to . She is supported by and 637 to a generally good cast : Peter Evans , Paul Hecht , Dwight Schultz , Clarence Williams and others , ably directed by Peter Wood . I take note of Nigel Williams 's Class Enemy ( Players Theatre : 115 MacDougal Street ) because it is an example of the vehement vituperation which an important segment of British playwrights levels against their society . The angry young men of the late 1950s were mostly middle-class dissidents , but the lower , and largely unemployed working-class characters in many British plays of - more recent date are far angrier than the fOrmer " angries " : they are in fact rabid . In Class Enemy , a group of adolescents in a " state comprehensive high school " in one of the poorest parts of South London waits for a teacher to arrive . But there is no teacher and we assume that most of the other classrooms are equally deprived . it is unclear ( though it may be clear to a , ri English audience ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " master . " But such factual considerations do not prevent our understanding the play . What is communicated with shocking effect is the sense of abandonment that the youngsters suffer , their bewilderment and despair , and finally the all-encompassing hatred which is expressed by the cleverest of them . The constant foul epithets aimed by the boys not only at their environment at large but also at one another are the outward sign of their self-humiliation and the degradation they have succumbed to , and in the venting of which they find a wretched relief . The potential for a decent humanity peeps through at climactic moments , but the overall impressionl , even when comic , is frightening . But it is neither to praise the play for its merits nor to censure it for its faults that I speak of it here . It is representative of what English audiences , at /east in such institutions as the state-subsidized Royal Court Theatre , - spond to  --  from a sense of recognition  --  with dogged , sometimes delighted , approval . The prevailing mood now , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , is sadomasochistic  --  sadistic among the poor ? masochistic among ' the better off . Such stage fare leaves no doubt that England is not only economically but spiritually in , deep trouble . Speaking critically , I have much more to say on the subject , but I shall come back to it on another occasion . What I would emphasize now is that I consider it a good sign that these black moods have for some years been loudly voiced in the English theater . Very little of any sort of social reaction is nowadays manifested on our stage . There are several good performances in Class Enemy  --  those of Lonny Price , Lance Davis and Bruce Wall in particular . But some of these actors must learn how to achieve relaxation within intensity : physical exertion is not the same as fullness of emotion . ?
