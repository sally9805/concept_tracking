txt Fat Salvage Held Faulty Our present method of fat salvage seems all wrong to me . We have been asked to save fuel , but must use gas or other fuel to render the fat ; and , even worse , we do not get half the liquid fat out of the scraps , as we can not exert sufficient pressure . As it is now , the fat obtained is not worth the fuel used and there is great waste . Why should n't we turn the fat in raw , or as it comes from the cooked meat , and then the government can have it rendered at a central plant with a minimum use of fuel and a maximum result in fat . The residue can then be used as it is in commercial plants , in fertilizer or dog food . We can turn it ' in often , so that it does not get smelly , and few of us will worry if the quantity is too small to warrant recompense . ELINOR F. YOUNG .
