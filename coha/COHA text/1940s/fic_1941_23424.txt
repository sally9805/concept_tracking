GOD SEES THE TRUTH A STORY BY JOSEPH FREEMAN Tr was getting cold . For a while I stood on the corner of Horatio and Greenwich and watched night settling on Jackson Square , then I crossed the street and went into the library . You hate to get caught at closing time in the middle of a novel , so I picked up a collection of short stories , put my hat and coat on the back of a chair , and sat down for a couple of hours with the classics  --  escape literature , the opium of the people . The man next to me coughed . The small library was crowded , chairs were close together , and I could sense him fidgeting in his . I looked up and saw a long brown face , deep-blue eyes , and a shock of purple-black hair . He wiped his lips with a handkerchief and concentrated on his book . I turned to mine . You do n't really escape . You read a story about China , Peru , or Madagascar and the characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your friend who was killed in Spain , or the front-page names who were great statesmen yesterday and are going to be shot to-morrow . Afterward you go home , think about the characters , change the plot , and try to figure out the meaning of the story . The man in the next chair leaned forward and began to write in a notebook . If he had the right kind of beard he would look like Don Quixote . Clean-shaven , he looked like an idealized Mephistopheles . I opened my book at random , the way was about a young Ivan Aksionov who lived in Vladimir . One summer day he started out for the Nizhni Fair , and his wife warned him not to go because she had dreamed he would come back from the Fair quite gray . Aksionov laughed that off and went away . The man in the next chair disengaged a pair of very long legs from under the table . In rising he knocked my hat down . Apologizing in a bass voice , he picked it up and replaced it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight accent I could n't place . He nodded and went off toward the shelves . I went back to Tolstoy . I began to live the strange life of Aksionov , a life of suffering and redemption , and I did n't notice when the man GOD SEES next to me came back . When I had finished " God Sees the Truth But Waits " I looked up and saw him hunched over his notes . / could n't see him clearly this time because there was mist in my eyes and I had to blow very hard into my handkerchief . The man looked up and smiled . A foreigner , I thought . He thinks because he picked my hat up that we 're friends for life . I thought this and caught myself smiling at him . It must have been the story , full of the mystical spirit of Tolstoy 's old age . They were starting to turn the lights out in the library . It 's always later than you think . I got into my coat and went to the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and frosty . I took a deep breath , reached into my pocket for a cigarette and fished up an empty Camel wrapper . I crumpled it and threw it away . " Please , " Mephistopheles said . He held out a pack of Luckies . I took one and he lighted it for me . In the flare of the match his face looked familiar . He smiled and said , " Wo n't you join me for a drink ? " " Thanks , " I said . " My name 's David Burns . " We shook hands . " You do n't recognize me ? " the tall man said . " I 'm sorry . " " Sic transit gloria mundi , " he intoned in his rich bass . " We met in Madrid . You were on the Lincoln Battalion paper and I was in the command of the Inter-nationals . " " Of course , " I said . " You 're the German playwright . But I ca n't remember your name . " " Erich Neumann , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . Just another exile . Vae victis . Besides " ? he broke into a boyish grin ? " history moves very rapidly these days . Let 's get our drink . It 's not far to the Hai Alai . " The bar was warm , and Neumann had enough sense to order sandwiches . After our second Spanish brandy I was beginning to feel good . " Excuse me , " Neumann said , " but something you were reading in the library seemed to move you very deeply . " " A story by Tolstoy . ' God Sees the Truth But Waits . ' The ending is swell . " " I do n't know that one , " he said . " Wo n't you be good enough to tell it ? " " It 's a shame to butcher a masterpiece , " I said , " but the gist of it is this . A merchant named Aksionov starts out for the Fair . On the way he meets another merchant whom he knows . They put up in the same inn for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always an early riser , gets up at dawn and drives ahead . About twenty-five miles down the road he stops to have his horses fed . Suddenly the police chief of the district appears and begins to cross-examine Aksionov about his movements the previous night . He says the other merchant has been found with his throat cut . They 'll have to search Aksionov 's things . The police go through his luggage and find a blood-stained knife . Aksionov is terribly upset . He stammers that the knife is not his . But the police chief says : ' This morning the merchant was found with his throat cut . He was robbed of twenty thousand rubles . The house was locked from the inside . You are the only one who could have done it . And here is the blood-stained knife in your bag . ' " Very good , " Neumann said , draining his glass . He held up two fingers to the bartender . " An innocent man is falsely accused of murder , and all the circumstantial evidence is against him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before us . " That 's not all , " I said . " The official then says to Aksionov , ' Your face and manner betray you . ' " Of course , " Neumann said . " The real criminal knows how to conceal his feelings . The innocent man becomes flustered . And the official mind reasons that he who is flustered must have committed the crime . " " That 's what happens , " I said . " Ak-sionov 's voice breaks , his face grows pale , he trembles with fear , he protests his innocence . " " That is , " Neumann grinned , " the hero exhibits all those symptoms of innocence which establish his guilt . " " Exactly . Aksionov is arrested . He is tried for killing and robbing the merchant and declared guilty . Afterward his wife and young children visit him in jail . There is a very touching scene between husband and wife . He urges her to petition the Tzar not to let an innocent man die , and she tells him such a petition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ' Tell me , dearest , tell your own wife , was n't it you who did it ? ' " " Did she say that ? " Neuman asked , looking up quickly . " That 's really marvellous . Tolstoy understood that an official lie is stronger than a private truth . Once you are accused of a crime , however falsely , those nearest to you begin to feel that where there 's smoke there must be fire . " He held up two fingers of his left hand to the bartender , and with his right scooped up some salted peanuts and popped them into his mouth . " That 's what she says , " I went on . " It upsets Aksionov very much . He bids his family good-by for the last time . Alone , he is in agony because his own wife suspects him . He says to himself : It seems only God can know the truth . We can appeal to Him alone , we can expect mercy from Him alone . ' So from now on Aksionov writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he only prays to God day and night . " " Unfortunately , " Neumann said , " the prayers do not affect the authorities . " " They do not , " I said . " The authorities condemn Aksionov to be flogged , then they send him for life to the Siberian mines . He lives there for twenty-six years as a convict . His hair and beard turn white , he walks slowly with a stoop , speaks little , never laughs , and prays often . On weekdays he reads The Lives of the Saints alone . On Sunday MAGAZINE he reads the Bible aloud in the son e pri church and sings in the choir . The au- thorities like him for his meekness . Th e other prisoners respect him . They call him Gran'dad and The Saint ; they make him their spokesman in dealing with the authorities and appoint him judge of their quarrels . All these years Aksionov gets no news from home . He does n't know whether his wife and children are alive . " " And they , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care whether he 's alive . " " Tolstoy does n't say anything about that . But one day a fresh gang of eon victs come to the prison . Among them is a tall strong man of sixty with a closely cropped gray beard . This man has been sent to Siberia for stealing a horse . He boasts that once he did something really wrong and should have been sent up long ago but was not caught . This man 's name is Makar and he says he comes from Vladimir . From him Aksionov learns that his wife is dead and his sons very rich . The other prisoners then tell Makar how poor old Aksionov came to Siberia . Thcy explain that some one had killed a merchant and put the knife among Aksionov 's things and Aksionov had been unjustly condemned . Makar slaps his knee and says : ' Well , this is wonderful ; it 's wonderful we should meet here . ' So Aksionov asks Makar whether he 's heard of that affair . Makar says ' yes , ' but he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who committed the murder must have been the man in whose bag the knife was found . ' How could anyone , ' he says to Aksionov , ' put the knife into your bag while it was under your head ? It would surely have awakened you ' . " " Makar is the murderer of course , " Neumann said smiling . " Aksionov senses that , " I said . " He knows this is the man who killed the merchant . " " Twenty-six years have passed since the crime , " Neumann said . " All these years an innocent man has been suffering for it . Now he faces the real criminal . GOD SEES THE TRUTH And the real criminal continues to lie about it . " " That 's it , " I said . " Aksionov walks away in silence . All night long he lies awake and thinks of his ruined life . At first he feels like killing himself . Then he thinks : It 's all that villain 's doing . His anger against Makar is so great he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own life . He prays all night but gets no peace . By day he avoids Makar . Two weeks pass this way . One night , walking about the prison , Aksionov catches his enemy digging a hole in the wall . Makar warns him : ' Keep quiet , old man , and you 'll get out too . If you talk , they 'll whale the living daylight out of me , but I 'll kill you first . ' Aksionov looks at his enemy and trembles with rage . ' I do n't want to escape , ' he says , and there 's no need for you to kill me . You killed me long ago . As for reporting you , I may do so or not , as God may direct . ' Next day the authorities , by sheer accident , discover the tunnel . The governor of the prison questions everybody to find out who dug it . The prisoners who know do n't want to betray Makar . The others are ignorant of the whole affair . So all the prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns to old Aksionov . " " Wait a minute , " Neumann said . " This sounds like the high point of the story and deserves a drink . " The bar-+ tender placed the bottle before us . " Go on , please , " Neumann said . " The Governor says to Aksionov : You 're a truthful old man , tell me who dug this tunnel . ' Aksionov trembles and thinks to himself : Why should I protect the man who ruined my life ? Let him pay for what I 've suffered . But if I tell , they will probably flog the life out of him . And maybe I suspect him wrongly . And after all , what good would it do me ? So Aksionov looks up at the governor and says : ' It 's not God 's will that I should tell . ' They ca n't make him say another word and the matter has to be dropped . " Neumann started to say something , but changed his mind . " That night , " I went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely over him and whispers : ' Forgive me . It was I who killed the merchant . I was going to kill you too , but I heard a noise outside , so I hid the knife in your bag and escaped through the window . ' Aksionov is silent and does n't know what to say , but Makar gets on his knees and begs : ' Forgive me ! For the love of God forgive me ! I will confess it was I who killed the merchant , and you will be released and go to your home . ' That 's what Makar says . But Aksionov says : It 's easy for you to talk . I 've suffered for you these twenty-six years . Where can I go now ? My wife is dead , my children have forgotten me . I have nowhere to go ' . Makar , still on his knees , begins to beat his head on the floor . Forgive me ! ' he cries . ' Look what I did to you , yet you had pity on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forgive me , miserable wretch that I am ! ' He begins to sob and , hearing this , Aksionov sobs too . " " Nineteenth-century Russians , " Neumann said . " And Aksionov says to Makar : ' Cod will forgive you . Maybe I 'm a hundred times worse than you . ' At these words Aksionov 's heart grows light , all desire for home leaves him , he no longer wants to quit the prison ; he only wants his last hour to come . The next morning Makar goes to the prison authorities . He confesses his guilt . An order is issued for Aksionov 's release . They bring it to his cell , but it is too late . " " Aksionov is dead , " Neumann whispered . " Yes . And that 's the end of Tolstoy 's story . " " A great story , " Neumann said . " I can see that . What I ca n't see is why it brought tears to your eyes . " " I have a cold , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filling our glasses . " I think I can explain your cold . You are living in an age when innocent men suffer for the crimes of the guilty . It enrages and bewilders you . You are relieved to read how the forgiveness of the innocent softens the heart of the guilty . By his beautiful charity , the saint heaps coals of fire upon the head of the murderer . In the end the guilty man confesses everything , the innocent man is exonerated , and all 's right with the world . " " There is something beautiful in that , " I said . " Only it 's too late , " Neumann grinned . " The exoneration does n't do the innocent man any good . By the time it comes he 's dead . " " What of it ? By the time he dies the innocent man knows he 's exonerated , and by the most important person in the drama for him  --  the real murderer . " " That 's the weakness of the story for our times , " Neumann said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's where it belongs . " " What has time to do with it ? " " We do n't know the real story of the nineteenth century , " he said . " It 's too near to us . But we know it was an age of great achievements , brutal deeds , and lofty ideals . Its romantic nostalgias and religious revivals haunted the laboratories of science like so many ghosts . Do you know what Stendhal said of the nineteenth century ? He said it was a hypocritical century . " Neumann folded his long fingers together and went on . " Do you know what made the nineteenth century hypocritical ? Opened by Napoleon , it was an age that worshipped the Strong Man . But its literature pretended that the real hero of every drama is the victim . However , Stendhal 's verdict may be too harsh . There were people in that century who had a conscience and were capable of dying for mere ideas . I imagine even a murderer could not escape the Zeitgeist . Confronted with the contrition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confesses . Yes , it all smells of the age that runs from Werther to the ' Cherry Orchard . ' But where could it possibly happen to-day ? " " Why not ? " " Because it 's against the spirit of our times , " Neumann said . " The twentieth century , which began in 1914 and is just getting under way , is terribly realistic . Consider the world about us and let me retell your story in a modern way . See if it does n't sound more familiar . " He slowly filled our glasses and looked at them in silence for a few moments . " To show that surface details do not matter , " he finally said in a low voice , " we are going to change them . Imagine that the story happens in my home town , the lovely village of Starnberg in Bavaria . We are going to call Aksionov , let us say Axel . Isdakar will be Mirbach . You can change all the other details if you like . Instead of an inn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autos ; instead of the blood-stained knife , an automatic that has been fired ; instead of The Lives of the Saints , the works of the philosophers ; instead of faith in God , faith in history , the conviction that time rectifies everything . I insist that these details do not matter . What is important in a murder is not the instrument but the murder . And what is important in our story is that for twenty-six years Aksionov-Axel has been suffering innocently for a crime which Makar-Mirbach committed . Everything happens just as it happened in Tolstoy 's tale . Even the character of Axel-Aksionov remains the same ; it seems that people like that still exist . At the end of twenty-six years he meets Mirbach-Makar in prison . Axel longs for revenge in his ambiguous way . The tunnel is discovered . And at this point we make the first vital change in the story . This is happening in the twentieth century instead of the nineteenth . " Neumann smiled , took a sip of brandy , wiped his lips with his handkerchief and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of the story . The governor of the prison is examining the convicts . He 's trying to find out who dug the tunnel by which a few of them planned to escape . He is urging Axel to tell the truth , and Axel is thinking the matter over . He has every reason for exposing Mirbach , but , as a nineteenth-century romantic , he takes pity on his enemy . He does n't want to see him punished . He begins to doubt whether Mirbach really committed that murder twenty-six years ago , and he feels that after all these years revenge would be senseless . " At this moment Mirbach is also thinking . He differs from Makar in one essential respect : he is a twentieth-century realist . The fact that he committed the murder and allowed an innocent man to suffer for it shows he is a Strong Man . Now one of the outstanding traits of the Strong Man is that he is incapable of imagining any motives except his own . Mirbach watches his victim hesitate at the Governor 's question and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was I who killed the merchant . He hates me because I have done him an irreparable hi-jury . If our positions were reversed , I should betray him . Why should n't he betray me ? As long as he is here , I can never rest . Even if he does n't tell on me now , he is bound to revenge himself some other time . The first law of life is self-preservation . It is either he or I. Besides , the interests of mankind require that I should survive . He is a weakling . He permitted himself to be punished and ruined for my crime . He is doomed by history . The future belongs to people like me . I was able to benefit from the murder and to escape punishment . History is always on the side of the victor . It is my moral duty to get this feeble mystic out of the way before he becomes a danger . He is a danger right now . He is hesitating and that proves he will give me away . I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very moment when Axel decides to protect his enemy , Mirbach raises his hand and speaks . ' Your Excellency , ' he says to the prison governor , know who dug the tunnel . It was Gran'dad Axel . ' " And now observe the reaction of the various characters in the Bavarian drama to this startling , wholly unexpected an nouncement . Axel of course is thunderstruck . He turns pale and stammers . he reacts in every way to this false accusation just as he did to the false accusation of murder twenty-six years ago . The poor old man stands there trembling and thinks : ' This ca n't happen to mc . ' To be sure , it has happened to him before , and it 's happening to him again at this very moment . But the born victim never believes anything can happen to him until it 's too late . But there is another reason why Axel stands helpless . He is paralyzed with fascination by Mirbach 's audacity . His rage is overcome by wonder and admiration . He is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say : ' Give him credit , he got away with it ; he 's a genius ; voila un homme That secret admiration is Axel 's undoing . " The prison governor is at first surprised by Mirbach 's accusation . But he has the typical official mind , like the police chief who arrested Axel twenty-six years ago . Axel 's agitation , the result of innocence , convinces the Governor of his guilt . " But most interesting is the reaction of the other prisoners . They have known and loved Axel for twenty-six years . He has been their spokesman and their judge . They know he has suffered for another man 's crime but they have no idea who the real criminal is . " On the question of the tunnel the prisoners are divided into two groups . A small minority know that Mirbach dug it . They are his fellow-conspirators in the plot . They know he is accusing Axel falsely , but Mirbach 's safety is their safety . They admire Mirbach 's brilliant maneuver in diverting the guilt to Axel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do not know who dug the tunnel . They think : Mirbach is a fine fellow . He has just arrived in prison and it 's not likely he would try to escape so soon . Anyway , why should he lie about Axel ? He could keep quiet like the rest of us . He would not say this unless it were true . Axel , on the other hand , has every reason for trying to escape . He has been here twenty-six years for a crime he did not commit . Anyone would try to escape under these circumstances , especially when he learns his sons are very rich . " The majority of the prisoners believe Mirbach is telling the truth . They are like Axel 's wife twenty-six years ago smoke there must be fire . And they do n't feel sorry that Axel is caught . On the contrary , they begin to resent him . They are no saints , but he is ; what right has he to try a trick like digging the tunnel ? " So Mirbach speaks his lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accusation except poor old Axel in his feeble way . That settles his fate . And since our story takes place in the twentieth century , Axel is not flogged . He is shot . " Mirbach , naturally , is delighted . He is safe from his victim . More than that , the authorities reward him for exposing the man who dug the tunnel . They want to show the prisoners that it pays to be an informer . They give him all sorts of privileges , and after a while they reduce his sentence and arrange for his release . " The day before he leaves prison Mirbach confides to the other convicts that all along he has known who killed the merchant twenty-six years ago . Poor old Axel was drunk when he did it and suffered from the illusion that he was innocent , and Mirbach did n't want to disturb that illusion . The convicts consider this very decent of Mirbach and cheer him when he leaves the prison . " " Why does he have to vilify the old man after he is dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vilify his victim , " Neumann said . " That 's the only way he can justify his crime . From the prison Mirbach goes back to Starnberg . He calls on Axel 's rich sons and tells them how he met their dear old Lather in prison and what intimatefriends they were . The Axels are ashamed of their father because he was a convict ; but they are also ashamed of being considered lacking in filial devotion . When Mirbach tells them how the old man died in his arms , they embrace him and present him with thirty thousand marks to show their gratitude and to get him far away from Starnberg as rapidly as possible . " With this money Mirbach goes to another town , opens a business and becomes rich . Nobody knows he is a robber and a murderer , and that an innocent man died for his crimes . He spends his remaining days as a pillar of virtue in the community . And never once does he think of poor old Axel in his grave . " " I can see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " But why must Mirbach become a pillar of society . Is n't that carrying the thing too far ? " " When crime is completely successful , " Neumann said , " it ceases to be crime and becomes virtue . We can know only the survivor 's story . " " In that case successful falsehood could become truth . " " That 's happened now and then , " Neumann smiled . Then his long , dark face became serious and he said , " Do n't you think my Starnberg story is nearer to the spirit of our times ? Some day I may write it . I 'll call it ' God Sees the Truth But Wo n't Talk ' . " " That , " I said , " would be blasphemy against religion , and against Tolstoy . " " I guess it would be , " Neumann said . " But I can think of a better title . It 's not my own . A modern painter named Kokoshka used it for a play he once wrote , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sondern der Ermordete ist schuldig . ' " " Sorry . I do n't know any German . " " It means : not the murderer but the murdered man is guilty . " " All this sounds like irony without pity , " I said . " The pity is there too , " Neumann said quietly , " if you know where to look for it . "
