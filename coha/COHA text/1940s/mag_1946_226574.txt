Up in the Senate last week rose Montana 's James E. Murray , wealthy , New Dealing chairman of a special Senate Committee on Small Business . In his hand he had a 359-page report on " Economic Concentration and World War II . " Its gist : Big Business , fattened on prime war contracts , was now bigger . He underlined this with a bit of demagogy : <P> " . . . concentration is the forerunner of collectivism . . . are we preventing collectivism when . . . corporations controlled by five financial interest groups* hold nearly one-third of our capacity ; when 2% of the concerns account for 62% of the total manufacturing employment ; and when big corporations are granted the patent rights on the fruits of wartime scientific research conducted at the taxpayers ' expense ? " <P> Other champions of small business have also been alarmed by the trend towards bigness . The 250 largest U.S. corporations in 1944 operated some $38.5 billion worth of manufacturing facilities , two-thirds of the U.S. total . This included $8.9 billion of usable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy . In 1939,75,000 U.S. manufacturers together owned only $39.6 billion worth . The thing to do , said Senator Murray , was to raise this year 's appropriation for the Department of Justice 's Antitrust Division from $1,700,000 , already approved by the House , to $7,000,000 . <P> Nobody denied the statistics in the Murray report . But , actually completed in January and based largely on data covering only the years through 1944 , it was open to criticism . Big business got the bulk of war contracts because it alone had the tools , technicians and resources to mass produce planes , tanks , etc . War 's end and the disposal of surplus plants , notably , aluminum producers , has radically altered this picture in many places . Moreover , small businesses closed by war have reopened . Fortnight ago the Department of Commerce reported a net increase of 400,000 new firms in the last two years . <P> Nevertheless , the report had again raised a pressing problem which the U.S. must solve : How can the real benefits of bigness , mass production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new competition ? <P> <P> * J.
