GTE day in February , 1937 , the l members Trade Commission the issFed-ion era witnessed what was probably the most hectic battle in its hectic history . The antagonists were Charles Atlas , a forty-eight-yearold husky who sells a correspondence course of physical-culture lessons without apparatus , and Bob Hoffman , a York , Pennsylvania , oil-burner manufacturer who puts out a comprehensive line of bar bells and dumbbells as a side line . Atlas and Hoffman occupy , respectively , the position that Big Steel and Little Steel do in heavy industry , and both are eternally at each other 's muscular throats . Hoffman , in this case , had been cited by the commission for unfair competition , for " publishing false , defamatory and misleading statements purporting to be descriptive of the method of training taught by those of his competitors who sell courses for physical training involving the resistance of one part of the body against another part . " Since Atlas is practically Hoff-man 's only living competitor , the commission called him to Washington to testify against his archenemy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ant strong men appeared before the five startled commissioners and proceeded to demonstrate weight lifting and other feats of strength , including walking on the thumbs . Hoffman and his assistants leaped on the witness tables , kicking briefs and exhibits into the faces of the commissioners . They stood on their heads and kicked chandeliers . Atlas , however , sat immovable in a corner of the room , his hands calmly folded across his forty-nine-inch chest  --  fiftyfour and three quarters inches , expanded and he neither said nor did anything . He looked as solemn as a Greek statue of his namesake , and he did not even twitch a muscle when Hoffman 's assistants climaxed their testimony by performing , in the words of a Washington correspondent of the United Press , " A muscle dance which would have made Little Egypt jealous . " Mail-Order Muscles TUST as stolid was Atlas dur- ingthe afternoon of his cross-examination . There finally came a particularly turbulent point in his testimony , when the argument waxed frantic over the wording of a question about the bending of iron bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head raged the torrents of argument . Finally , Atlas raised his hand majestically and , amidst a sudden hush , uttered these classic words . " Gentlemen , gentlemen , " he said solemnly , " I wish I had one of those iron bars with me now , and I would bend it for you gentlemen right now , and then we would all relax ourselves a little . " And that , in a phrase out of his own mouth , sums up the oddly simple and sincere personality of a man who , next to Sears , Roebuck , operates probably the most successful mail-order business in this country . Call it naivet ? , but Charles Atlas honestly believes that muscular prowess is a sovereign balm for every ailment , including litigation . After twenty years of writing , talking and selling the good clean life of exercise and fresh air and wholesome diet , you might expect Atlas to be cynical by now  --  but world-wide fame as the No. 1 muscle builder of this , or any other , generation has only intensified Atlas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think back on my childhood days , " he says , pounding on a desk , " it does n't seem possible that today the whole world looks up to me as the most ideal specimen of the human body . It is a great responsibility . " For nearly twenty years the iron-muscled body of Atlas has fascinated adolescents . They find his advertisements in nearly every magazine they read , because Atlas advertises in some 125 pulp-paper magazines . Where parents , hygiene teachers and Boy Scoutmasters have failed , Atlas manages to inculcate the ideal of physical strength and bodily beauty . Little boys tear out these full-page advertisements showing the nude Atlas , clad only in a leopard skin around his midriff , with one fist lunging out at the eyes of the reader , and his lips crying , " I 'll prove that YOU , too , can be a NEW MAN ! " This fascination that Atlas has for the small fry can be something of a nuisance . In the first place , the moppets are always filling out his coupons : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tension will help make a New Man of me  --  give me a healthy , husky body and big muscles . " Since it costs Atlas about two dollars to send out the series of five or six circulars and free booklets which every prospective Sandow receives , it would obviously be economic suicide to mail a sales talk to every coupon filler . There is one stenographer in the Atlas organization who has developed a facility for recognizing juvenile handwriting . As soon as she spots a kid scrawl , it is thrown into the wastebasket . This technique is n't infallible : a lot of adults with twenty-five dollars in their jeans have never mastered the Palmer method of penmanship . " We probably lose thousands of customers every year , " sighs Charles P. Roman , partner and general manager of Charles Atlas , Ltd. , " because we have to throw away those suspicious-looking coupons . But what else can we do ? " JI Strong Man 's Signature THEN there are also the small fry who insist on I personally visiting Atlas ' headquarters at 115 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for themselves if such a Goliath really exists . Roman , an exponent of business efficiency , has for years been trying to set a house policy of telling the little boys that Mr. Atlas is out of town , but Atlas himself , a starry-eyed idealist , insists on personally chatting with everybody . " First off , " he says proudly , " they want to feel my biceps . So I let ' em feel my biceps . Then they say , Gee . ' Then they want to know if they can get like me . And I say , ' Yes , if you work hard at building the body . Nothin ' comes easy in this world , ' I say . I say , ' Live clean , think clean , and do n't go to burlesque shows . ' Then , if I see they are really payin ' attention , I bend a spike for them and give it to them for a souvenir . " When he is in a friendly mood -- and Atlas is nearly always in a friendly mood  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Jesse Jones , Owen D. Young , Warden Lewis E. Lawes and Joan Blondell . The spikes , which are handy as paperweights when bent , are two-foot-long , railroadbridge-timber spikes . Atlas buys them in 500-lot kegs direct from an ironworks . It takes him about thirty seconds to bend a spike . First he hammers it into the shape of a bow by pressing the spike between his thighs and smashing at it with both fists , and then he curves it under his chin and squeezes it until he is pink in the face and the spike is a perfect u . Atlas estimates that he bends about 1500 spikes a year . When he was younger , Atlas used to impress strangers by tearing a telephone book in half , but he does n't tear books any more . " It 's too easy , " he explains , " and also I like to leave ' em with a little souvenir . What good is a torn telephone book ? . " When you consider that Atlas is selling one of the least desirable commodities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strenuous physical exercise every day  --  the statistics of his business are amazing . Since he inserted his first one-column , two-inch ad in Bernarr Macfadden 's Physical Culture Magazine , eighteen years ago , Atlas has sold his course of lessons to more than 400,000 pupils . He once figured out that he had added no less than 6,000,000 pounds of solid , rippling flesh to the American body . He employs twenty-seven girls to answer his mail , spends about $1000 a month on postage , and sends out two truckloads of letters each day . His display-advertising budget calls for $65,000 a year , and the expenses of printing and mailing the follow-up circulars and booklets add another $120,000 to the advertising outlay . An average of 2500 new pupils enrolls each month , including students in England , South Africa , India , the Hawaiian Islands and the Philippine Islands . Not long ago , a Filipino disciple wrote in to say , " Some time ago I enrolled as one of your students . I was very skinny , with small bones . Enclosed you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today I feel that no man can rule or oppress me . " Atlas hopes that his client has been taking it out on the Jape . Two years ago , Atlas ' course of thirteen lessons was translated into Spanish and Portuguese , and dynamic tension has been selling like hot cakes in Latin America . But what really thrills the strong man 's heart is to learn of a pulp , with his photograph , finding its way to a far-off section of the world . One morning , a small , bearded , bustling gentleman , carrying a brief case , burst into his office . He stated that he was a Doctor Goldberg , an anthropologist , recently returned from a trip to Africa . He told Atlas that he had visited a lonely Bantu village . The21 chief had taken him to a mud but and showed him the tribe 's proudest possession . It stood in a special niche , and an oil lamp burned day and night underneath it . It was a photograph of Charles Atlas , clipped from an issue of Argosy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained the chief , pointing to Atlas ; " he make very good magic . " " So , " concluded Doctor Goldberg , extending his arm , " I came up to shake the hand of the great white god . " In this world of ballyhoo , where things are seldom what they seem , Charles Atlas more than lives up to your expectations . He is no creation of a copy writer 's imagination . When you see him , dressed or undressed , you are inclined to paraphrase the words of Mark Antony : " There is a man ! " Charles Atlas is a man to every last inch of his five feet , ten inches . He is forty-eight years old , looks twenty-eight , and has the energy of eighteen . His muscles are not knobby , but are smoothly distributed over his large-boned frame . His hair is curly black , and silvery gray at the edges . His eyes , always aglow , are dark brown . He weighs 180 pounds , and his naked arms are like a pair of pistons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns . When he walks about a room or pounds a table , there is a spring and resiliency to every little movement . Atlas claims that he learned his dynamic-tension system of exercises by watching tigers exercise in the Prospect Park Zoo , and , as you watch him in action , the resemblance to the sinewed grace of a restless tiger becomes overpowering . " Sometimes you expect Charlie to open his mouth and roar like the king of the jungle , " says one of his friends . When Fred Allen , the comedian , was first introduced to Atlas , he was stunned . " I can see , " Allen remarked , running his eyes over the Atlas physique , " that Nature finally hit the jack pot ! " The Simple Life AT THE age of forty-eight , Atlas puts in three nights of strenuous track work at the N. Y. A. C. , spends thirty minutes in dynamic-tension calisthenics every morning before breakfast , swims two miles a day at his Long Island seaside cottage , and goes for a one-mile run along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never troubled by disease , not even the common cold . " I would n't be surprised , " he says , " if I live forever . At the rate I 'm going , I 'm getting younger , not older . " Verbal expression does n't come easily to this muscular mastodon , and , when he tries to sum up some phase of his life , he knits his bushy black eyebrows , screws up his forehead , tosses his neck backward , cocks his head at a slight angle , and looks exactly like Franklin D. Roosevelt . Atlas is very proud of his resemblance to Roosevelt . " If the President , " says Atlas , " ever wants a double like Hitler has a double , I am ready to serve him . " He does n't smoke cigars or cigarettes . He does n't drink coffee , tea , whisky or beer . He does n't go to the movies or to night clubs or to high-toned restaurants . His idea of a good meal is a glass of fruit juice , half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a glass of milk . He does n't play bridge or poker . " My idea of a good time , " he says , " is to get myself an apple or a couple of raw figs and take a walk around the reservoir in Central Park while I 'm eatin ' the apple or figs . All you get in a night club is a load of germs . " Atlas ' wife , a buxom black-haired woman , Margaret , is almost as strong in her own way as her husband . Although she is strictly a nonprofessional . Mrs. Atlas can do acrobatic handstands and often lifts up her husband with one hand and whirls him around in the air . On dull winter evenings , Mr. and Mrs. Atlas amuse each other by doing handstands and seeing which can lift the other higher . Mr. and Mrs. Atlas have two children , appropriately named Hercules and Diana . Hercules also has a splendid physique and is taking the premedical course at New York University ; all his friends at N. Y. U. call him " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying operatic singing . Atlas believes that the unusual physical condition of his youngsters is a vindication of the doctrines of dynamic tension . " I started giving them the old dynamic-tension routine , " he says , " when they were still in the cradle . " Charles Atlas was born Angelo Siciliano on October 30 , 1893 , near the town of Acri , in Calabria , Italy . When he was ten , his parents became . estranged , and his mother took him off to begin a new life in America . Mother and son had only a few dollars when they arrived in New York . Mrs. Siciliano , who is sixty-five and is living in robust health , supported herself and the boy by working about twelve hours a day as a seamstress in a sweatshop . The change from the wheat fields of sunny Southern Italy to the dark , dank streets of New York affected Angelo 's health . He could n't even climb the stairs to the family flat , and so Mrs. Siciliano moved in with an uncle , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Up till the age of seventeen , " says Atlas , " I was a ninety-seven-pound runt . I was skinny , pale , nervous and weak . " Front Street , near the East River , was no place for a weakling . It was a melting pot where the Italian , Jewish , Irish and Polish boys were continually brawling with one another . Atlas meekly accepted all the punishment visited upon him by his tormentors . In 1908 , at the age of fifteen , he left high school and started working in a factory manufacturing women 's pocketbooks . It looked as if he was growing up into one of those hollowcheeked , sallow-skinned slum children . And then , as Angelo was returning from work , he was attacked by one of the neighborhood bullies . " It was Hollow-e'en , " says Atlas , " and this guy had a stocking full of ashes . He knocked me down in the gutter , and then he started hitting me over the head with this stocking . It seemed like he was beating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave me alone , and , when he finally ran away , I must have laid there in the gutter for an hour resting up . Then I went home , and my uncle said , ' What 's the idea of getting into fights , you bum ? ' and he gave me another beating . I went to my room and I cried myself to sleep , but before I fell asleep , I swore an oath to my God that I would never allow any man on this earth to hurt me again . " Atlas is a devout Roman Catholic ; he attends Mass every Sunday and the only book he ever reads is a well-worn volume of devotions and simple prayers , and so , when he swore an oath , it was n't merely wind in his mouth . Revenge is Sweet He tore out a photograph of Eugene Sandow , the greatest weight lifter of all time , and he pasted it on the mirror of his dresser . He wrote away for information about the Swoboda course of physical culture , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the forty dollars to pay for the courses . He began to read Physical Culture Magazine and tried every exercise and every system of exercising he heard about . He attended the nearest Y. M. C. A. gymnasium and watched every exercise . Then he would go home  --  and this , mind you , was after a day of work in a factory  --  and strip himself naked , and then , before a mirror , he would rehearse his exercises for four solid hours , night after night . Too poor to buy a bar bell , he says , " I made myself a bar bell with a stick and two stones weighing about twenty-five pounds each . I tied the stones to the end of the stick and made a bar bell . " Looking back , he says today , " I believe I was more interested in muscles than any man that ever lived . " Although such exponents of the barbell technique as Bob Hoffman scoff at the story , Atlas insists he really did n't begin to develop till he worked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the muscles of the body are developed by opposing one group of muscles against another group . " I used to go to the zoo every Sunday , " Atlas reminisces , " and I was crazy about the tigers . I used to ask myself , ' How does Mr. Tiger keep in physical condition ? Did you ever see a tiger with a bar bell ? ' So I began to copy the exercises of the tiger , and I also watched cats and dogs exercising . In less than twelve months , by this method of exercising , I doubled my weight , and I became so strong that I beat up the guy who had given me the beating on Hollowe'en . " When Atlas gave the above description of the origin of dynamic tension before the Federal Trade Commission , Hoffman 's lawyer asked him if he would give one exercise as a sample . " Well , " said Atlas , " you take one hand and press it against the palm of the other , then you push it up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push it up , and then you push down , resisting the arm trying to push you down . " Then the lawyer leaped in for the kill . " Did you ever , M r.Atlas , " he sneered , " see a dog put one paw against the other and resist it as he pushed it up in the air and push it down again ? " For a moment , Atlas was taken aback . " Of course , " he replied finally , " of course he does ! My dog does that all the time ! " In 1912 , Atlas got a job demonstrating a chest developer in an empty store on upper Broadway . Although he did n't believe in the efficacy of apparatus , Atlas liked the job because he would combine work and his physical training at the same time . In 1914 , a professional strong man , Young Samson , watched a demonstration , and then invited Atlas to team up with him in a circus-and-vaudeville act . Atlas , whose body was not only strong but plastically symmetrical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as such conventional feats of power as weight lifting , knocking a nail into a block of wood with his bare hand , bending spikes and tearing a telephone book in two . His big moment was lying on a bed of seven thousand nails munching a banana while three husky spectators stood on his body . " Women used to faint when I did that , " says Atlas . " They could n't stand watching a beautiful body like mine being abused by three men standing on my chest . " It was while working at the Coney Island Circus Side Show that Atlas encountered Arthur Lee , a sculptor , and modeled for the body of a statue of Abraham Lincoln . Atlas found posing more to his taste than public exhibitions , and until 1921 he devoted most of his time to sitting for such sculptors as Mrs. Harry Payne Whitney , Frederick MacMonnies , Tony Salemme , Stirling Calder and James Earle Fraser . The usual rate for male models was fifty cents an hour , but Atlas received one dollar . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that they were ashamed to pay me fifty cents . " Atlas was ideal as a model . Most models may have perfect ears , or throat , or legs , or arms , but Atlas was perfect in every respect . MacMonnies , a careful student of the work of Phidias and other Greek sculptors , once stated : " If I had not seen the external oblique stomach muscles of Charles Atlas , I would not have believed that the Greeks actually had such prominent external obliques as we see portrayed in the ancient statues . " And , adds Atlas , " The same applies to every other part of my body . I remember , when I used to walk into a studio on MacDougal Alley in Greenwich Village , they would holler , ' Here comes the Greek god . ' In fact , that was my nickname among the sculptors . " Atlas runs into bronze and marble imitations of himself wherever he goes . He is Alexander Hamilton in front of the United States Treasury Building in Washington , D. C. He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Capitol in Jefferson City . He is Energy in Repose on the Federal Reserve Bank Building . He is also the arms and legs of the notorious Civic Virtue statue that used to stand outside New York 's City Hall . JI Samson With a Purpose Atlas was very happy during his association with artists . " They are happy-go-lucky folks , " he says , " and they appreciate the beauty of the living life more than any other folks . " Atlas probably appreciates appreciation of his physical grandeur more than anything else , and certainly more than money , despite the fact that he earns close to $150,000 annually . Atlas had one frustrating experience with sculptors . Mrs. Whitney asked him to take the then youthful C. V. ( " Sonny " ) Whitney in hand and build the boy up . Atlas did his best , but Mr. Whitney , who is still known as " Sonny " to his intimates , was bored by dynamic tension . " These rich boys , " Atlas says philosophically , " they 're a lazy bunch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another symmetrical Samson of the period and founder of a now-defunct course of body building , in a vaudeville act known as The Orpheum Models , which played forty-two weeks on the Orpheum Circuit . Another time , as a circulation stunt for the Brooklyn Daily Times , Atlas pulled six automobiles in Brooklyn for a mile . The circulation of the Brooklyn Daily Times did not increase a whit , and no crowds gathered to watch the stunt . Nothing surprises people in Brooklyn . In 1936 , Atlas towed the seventy-two and one half ton Broadway Limited locomotive 112 feet along its tracks . Atlas asserts that with about two weeks of extra-special conditioning he could repeat any of these feats . " But get this straight , " insists Atlas , with a menacing glower , " I am not just a strong man . I do n't believe in strength for the slice of strength , just to show off . I believe in using shapely muscles to make a better life and a better world . " In 1921 came the turning point in Atlas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the Most Beautiful Man in America . Atlas submitted two photographs . He won , biceps down . Bernarr Macfadden was skeptical about the accuracy of the photographs and he insisted on scrutinizing Atlas before awarding the $1000 prize . Atlas came to the Physical Culture offices in the Flatiron Building and was carefully examined by Macfadden . " Mr. Atlas , " said the old master finally , " you are the living realization of my lifelong battle for the body beautiful . You have a great future . " In 1922 , Physical Culture sponsored another contest to find America 's Most Perfectly Developed Man . Atlas competed against 750 other masculine dreams in Madison Square Garden , and he won again . After this , Mac , fadden stopped all contests . " What is the use ? " he said . " Atlas will win every time . " From then on , Atlas began using the title , The World 's Most Perfectly Developed Man . The only muscular marvel who has dared to challenge the title is Johnny Grimek , who was named Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contests under the auspices of the Amateur Athletic Union . Grimek is a disciple of the Hoffman school of body building . Atlas refuses to recognize Grimek 's claim and says he is still undisputed champion . Atlas cites the opinion of Dan Parker , the sports editor of the New York Daily Mirror . Parker was one of the judges of the 1940 contest in Madison Square Garden . After Grimek was voted Mr. America , Parker wrote a dissenting opinion . " If Grimek , " wrote Parker , " is the ideal type of American manhood , then Man Mountain Dean is Apollo . I understand that Grimek is the assistant editor of Bob Hoffman 's magazine , Health and Strength . How Johnny is able to pick up a magazine to proofread is beyond me . He is so sheathed in bulging muscles that he can hardly lift an arm without having a deltoid crash into a tricep . He is built like an old-fashioned Sears , Roebuck fireplace . " At the advice of " Dr. " Frederick Richard Tilney , a writer for Physical Culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . Tilney was not an M.D. , but a naturopath . He ghost-wrote a course of thirteen lessons , and entered into a partnership with Atlas on a fifty-fifty basis . It took nearly ten years to develop the sure-fire selling angles and to build the business to its present peak . From Tigers to Tension The earliest Atlas advertisements were captioned meekly : ARE You A RED-BLOODED MAN ? and mildly carried out the theme of acquiring general physical well-being . By 1925 , the ads reflected the hurly-burly era of Coolidge prosperity . Do YOU WANT TO RE A TIGER ? ran one famous ad . " It 's the Tiger Men who grab everything they want these days . The new race of Tiger Men win the battles of pelf and power in the mad , dizzy , jazzy marathon for personal success ! They whiz by you in stunning big limousines , they have fine homes and bulging bank accounts . " After General Manager Roman took over the selling end of Atlas , Ltd. , in 1928 , the attack changed . Roman , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a genius at composing smart mail-order copy , invented the phrase " dynamic tension " to describe the Atlas technique , and he now began to sell muscles , pure and simple . " I 'll add five inches to your chest , " the ads began to read . " I 'll prove in only seven days that I can make YOU a new man . Just tell me where you want handsome steellike muscles . YOU , too , can have a body like mine . " The body-building industry reacts sensitively to business conditions and to wars . The first boom in muscle building grew directly out of World War I. Young men become acutely conscious of their bodies during a war , and , because they are thrown into close quarters with other men , they become eager to have bigger muscles than the other boys . The percentage of draftee rejections also starts a wave of viewingwith-alarm and makes public opinion sharply conscious of physical culture . A period of prosperity-1922 through 1929 ? is death to the muscle industry ; everyone is too busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the chest . Around 1927 , Atlas ' mail-order business had shrunk so alarmingly that he had to open a gymnasium on Broadway to keep himself going . But orders spurted with the onset of the depression , and by 1932 business began to attain its present level . Roman explains the phenomenon in this way : " During a depression the unemployed have more time for exercise . Also they figure maybe the reason they are out of work is because they lack physical power . We always do well in hard times in this business . " The war is again booming trade for Charles Atlas , Ltd. , with the increase in pupils estimated at about 20 per cent a month . The Selective Service System recently reported the disquieting news that close to 50 per cent of the men examined for the draft had been rejected for physical reasons . The SSS is said to he considering a program of rehabilitation for these men . " Why , " shouts Atlas , " did n't the United States do something about this years ago ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . Why do we have to wait for an emergency to worry about the health of our young men ? I say that physical training should be made compulsory and every able-bodied boy and man over the age of sixteen should be forced to attend a gym at least three hours a week . You ca n't build up these rejected boys in a couple of weeks . It will take at least three months to undo all the poison in their system and get them back to following the road of Nature . " Atlas says that one reason the German soldier is superior is that calisthenics has been compulsory in Germany for over a hundred years . As a matter of fact , the modern movement for physical education was founded by Turrivater Jahn , a German schoolmaster and political fanatic , whose perfervid ideas on race and blood influenced Hitler . Jahn , who wanted to raise a secret army to fight Napoleon within Germany , organized classes in physical training and founded the art of weight lifting . Ironically enough , it is n't the rejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men already in service . Privates in practically every Army camp in the country are now studying the Atlas lessons . When he considers all the wonderful things he does for the young men of America , Charles Atlas often wonders why the Federal Trade Commission is always pestering him about his ads . They had him on the griddle in 1932 , and , after a thorough examination of his past history and his claims and his course of dynamic tension , they gave him a clean bill of health . In 1939 , he found another complaint thrown at his corporation . In a fit of rage , Atlas called in the reporters and defied the Federal Trade Commission and the entire New Deal , in words that many another businessman has probably wished he had the courage to use , " I 'm going to send the President my special dynamic-tension course , " shouted Atlas , " and ask him to use it for one week , and then decide which is right , me or the commission ! They say it 's unfair competition ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em all out ! Listen , I was down there in Washington six or seven years ago , and I took off my clothes and showed ' em I was the man I said I was . One of them said , ' We all got fat bellies around here , ' and that they would be my pupils . What 's a matter with those fellers up in Washington ? There must he a new clique in there . Maybe that 's the whole trouble ; maybe they 're sick men ; maybe the whole New Deal is full of sick men . " Then he pleadingly glanced at the reporters . " Boys , " he said , " I really am doin ' the cleanest work of any man livin ' today . " The conflict ended with a compromise victory for Atlas . When Strong Men Clash Eight exercises in the Atlas system are completely original with Atlas . The others , as Atlas himself is quick to admit , are derived from Hindu muscle-control exercises , from Waiter Camp 's ideas on calisthenics , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tigers . The systematization , however , in the form of dynamic tension , is Atlas ' main contribution . As an example of dynamic tension , here is Atlas ' famous dipping exercise , which he says is the basic secret of " acquiring an enormous chest . " " Place two chairs side by side , about eighteen inches apart . Then , with a hand resting on the seat of each chair , the body extended in a sloping position , feet on the floor , dip down as low as you can between the chairs , letting the chest touch the floor as near as possible . Come up slowly , breathing in , and go down again while breathing out . Bend the elbows as you go down and bring the arms straight as you come up . Continue until slightly tired . " Hoffman , the chief enemy of dynamic tension , which he once called dynamic hooey , maintains , however , that " the practice of physical training which involves the resistance of one set of muscles to another set in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the reflex co-ordination between the cortex , the medulla oblongata , the diencephalon and other co-ordination centers of the brain , and makes for muscular inefficiency and incompetence . " Carl Easton Williams , a former editor of Physical Culture and an authority on exercise , once stated : " In order to get results from exercise , you must employ resistance , whether by weight of your own body , or by external weights , springs , elastic cords , or even by the trick of opposing one group of muscles against another group in your own body through mental control . Weight lifting is the quickest way to get muscles , but you also get bunchy , ugly muscles , slowness of movement , and a muscle-bound condition . " Among Atlas ' famous pupils are Theodore Steinway , the piano manufacturer , and Max Baer , who signed up for the course in 1924 . Bob Ripley , Harry Von Zell and Fred Allen have also taken tension tutelage from Atlas . One of his favorite recreations is to visit the training camps of prize fighters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POST February 7,1942 exercise problems . Atlas has coached Lou Ambers , Jack Sharkey , Tommy Farr and Sixth Escobar . It was while visiting with Escobar at a Pompton Lakes , New Jersey , training camp that Atlas first met Joe Louis . Promoter Mike Jacobs , who was trying to kindle some publicity for an Escobar bout , asked Louis to watch Escobar train . Jock Blackburn , Louis ' manager , introduced the champion to Atlas . " This is the famous Charlie Atlas . " said Blackburn . " Yeah ? " said Louis dully , his face unmoved . " Hello , " said Atlas . " He 's the inventor of dynamic tension , " pursued Blackburn . " What 's that ? " drawled Louis . Atlas gave a thumbnail description of dynamic tension . Louis mulled it over thoroughly for several minutes . Finally he seemed to get the idea . He flexed his arm and said , " Yuh mean like this ? " Then out shot the arm . Atlas , meanwhile , had hunched forward to see if Louis ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force of the blow on his face . " Yes , " murmured Atlas weakly , rubbing his cheekbone , " just like that ! " This was one of the two occasions when Atlas ' passion for physical culture got him into embarrassment . The other happened on May 2 , 1939 , when he went up to Sing Sing and put on a strong-man exhibition for the convicts . He tore telephone books , lifted a 250-pound man above his shoulders , and climaxed his performance by bending and breaking a two-foot iron bar . After the performance , Atlas had coffee and cake with Warden Lawes . " It was a great show you put on , Charlie , " said the warden , " but I did n't like one number . " " What was that ? " asked Atlas . " That bending the bar . That was bad stuff . Might put ideas into a prisoner 's head ! " With the way Americans are dissipating , Atlas sees little hope for the future unless we mend our bodily habits . Whenever he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he will say something like this : " Feet will disappear in 500 years unless Americans walk more . " Atlas believes that hot jazz and violent swing music have a malignant effect on the muscles of the body . Atlas writes ten letters a week to the local radio stations asking them " to cut out all this screechy noise and give us real music .
