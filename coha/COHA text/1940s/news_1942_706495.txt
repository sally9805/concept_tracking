txt There is something more than wishful thinking in saying that the prospects of the Allied Nations showed an improvement over the week . In the first place , there were no Axis successes and , in the second place , there was more than one evidence of a virility on the part of the anti-Axis forces which lends import to the promises of large offensive action in the months to come . In its effect on the war as a whole , the most potent develop . ment was the start of the 1,000-plane bombing expeditions of the Royal Air Force against Germany and German-held territory . A : continuance of these attacks  --  and it is expected they will continue  - -  justifies the statement that they really represent a second front ? in Europe . The attack on Cologne was colossal not only in its execution but in its results . Thet . Germans are carefully conceding cans . on the other . It is a reassurthe true story of damage done , but ing thought that the expanding reports leaking out indicate that a United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British production tocity was devastated . A statement gether throw a heavy burden nn from London says that 100 square miles was laid waste . An important railroad center . Cologne was the site of a large number of important war industrial plants . No direct information is avail:able of the damage done to the arsenal city of ' Essen and its environs . But the British say the damage was heavy and reports seeping out from the Third Reich tell of upward of 200,000 persons being evacuated from the region bombed by the R. A. F. More Raids Promised There are other important cities which can be reached with small extension or no extension of the range used by the bombers which attacked Cologne . There is Bremen , %vhich was bombed during the week . There are Hamburg and Mainz and Frankfort. just a little farther on . Hanover is not an enormous distance beyond Cologne . It will have been noted that fighter planes accompanied the bombers which raided Cologne as they accompany bombers which attack German-run factories in Northern France , Belgium and Holland . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as Berlin . The last time the R. A. F. attacked Berlin it sustained heavy losses , some of which , it is true , were due to a bad storm . Yet it is not to be taken for granted that distance will always protect the Nazi capital from raiders of the United Nations . Some United States fighter planes went along on the raid over Cologne , but the bombers . it is stated officially , were all British . The declarations of General Arnold in London make it plain that it is in the cards that American bombing squadrons will be joining the ? British in future raids . The Larger Outlook In these raids there is more involved than punishment directly inflicted on Germany . There is much talk of a second land front in Europe which would serve to divert some German strength from . the Russian front . There are already reports that air strength is being withdrawn from the Eastern front by the Germans to meet the peril of the new mass raids by the R. A. F. But . more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an army in Western Europe would depend on air mastery over the regions involved . That air mastery must he achieved from English bases by British and American planes . The raids over Western Germany and over Northern France may be taken as being a part of the larger problem of obtaining air supremacy over the Germans along the French coast . Furthermore , it opens up the prospect of an air fight of attrition between the Germans , on the one hand . and the British and AmeriHitler to niaintain such a wearingdown contest . Reports from Germany have it that Hitler has not yet started his promised offensive against Russia . But it was to have been a Spring offensive : the Fuehrer said as much . But June is the first month of Summer . which means Spring has gone . It is true that it was June 22 when the Nazis started last year 's attack on Russia , but , then , Hitler said in three speeches that he had started too late , haying been delayed by his Balkan campaign . So , one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start . The reports from Russia are still optimistic about the effect of the attacks of Marshal Timoshenko against the German lines . It is Moscow 's claim that these attacks served to put awry the German plans for their offensive . However that may be , it is the general expectation of foreign military experts that the Nazis arc about to launch another drive on Stalin 's armies and it is to be expected that they will put their utmost strength into the effort . Hitler 's Offensive This must be the case . because it is evident that Hitler must whip ; the Russians this year or riot at all . It is hard to see how he will ever again be in as good position as he is now . Time works for the ' Russians because they have superior man power and time permits the training of additional ' armies . which , if they can be equipped . can with difficulty be matched numerically by Hitler . In a review of the situation one should not fail to mention that the drive of General Rommel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sought . In fact , the British seem confident that if Rommel was trying to drive on Suez he has been successfully blocked . After two small raids on Dutch ' Harbor , which must have been feints , the Japanese showed up off I Midway Island with a large naval force . It had all the appearance of being a serious effort to wreck United States power in the midPacific and was so taken in Wash , ington . Admiral Nimitz has declared ! that the force has been stopped with considerable damage . The fight is not over ; it is continuing . And it is entirely possible that the Japanese command may reinforce the naval forces sent against Mid ! way . It is much too early to make I any definite judgment on the outcome beyond saying that the first round appears to have gone safely to the United States . Transports to Where ? A very significant fact is that the Japanese force included transports . For where were these troops destined ? Transports would scarcely be needed for a garrison . on Midway Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must have had other plans . Did they intend these forces for the occupation of the Hawaiian Islands ? Or is it possible they thought they would he able to send them still farther eastward ? In Tokyo there has been frequent talk about landing on the Pacific Coast . Nothing may be told about the disposition of United States forces i the Pacific . There have been reports that the Japanese have held eight capital ships at Truk Island , then in the Bonins and then back to Truk . Admiral Nimitz reports that Japanese battleships have been involved in the Midway fighting . Three battleships is generally the minimum in a capital ship group . If one knew just how many capital ships the Japanese were moving to Midway , one would have a clearer idea of what is involved in Japanese tactics . To complete the picture , Chiang Kai-shek said in a speech that the worst was over for China , a refreshing assurance in view of the drive against the Chinese which the Japanese are pushing . All in all , not such a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an offensive . " Low Cl ) All Countries
