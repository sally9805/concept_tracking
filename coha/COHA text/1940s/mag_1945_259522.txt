( See Cover ) <P> In determined and confident tones , the powerful United Automobile , Aircraft and Agricultural Implement Workers ( C.I.O. ) read out the declaration of war . Said the union : the auto industry must raise wages 30% to make up for the loss in take-home pay caused by the return of peace , i.e. , the loss of eight hours of overtime when the week was cut from 48 to 40 . The industry , said the union , must raise wages without raising auto prices , * which have not yet been fixed . <P> If the pay raise is not granted , said the union , it would strike one automaker and close all his plants and keep them closed . The spectacle of those tight-shut , silent plants , said the union , should be a lesson to the rest of the industry . <P> First Assault . Which automobile company would be the target for this all-out assault ? For a day , the union kept mum on its choice . Then wily , redheaded Walter Philip Reuther , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corp . <P> The union had timed its stroke with the care of a general planning an invasion . It could hardly have picked a better time for itself , a worse one for G.M. Swamped by $2 billion in contract cancellations immediately after V-J day , G.M. had sweated and strained to reconvert its 102 plants all over the U.S. It had the biggest job of all U.S. industry ; some 35% of the entire reconversion job of the nation . By working night &; day , G.M. had cleared acres of tools from its plants , nearly completed installation of hundreds of miles of conveyors , set up dozens of assembly lines . Now the back-breaking job was almost done . The new lines were running in Detroit . <P> This week , from the spanking new assembly plant in Detroit , where only two months ago G.M. had been building tanks , the corporation rolled out a glistening new Cadillac . It was the first car G.M. 's production lines have turned out since February 1942 . It looked much the same as the 1942 model , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> G.M. had planned to be ready soon to produce all of its cars . Pontiac was scheduled to start rolling off the lines in a week . Buick a week later , and Chevrolet and Oldsmobile in two weeks . <P> Reconversion had gone so well that G.M. had confidently set its production sights high . In the next year it had hoped to turn out from 1,328,000 to 1,770,000 cars , sell them at prices " somewhat " above those of 1942 . <P> Then suddenly came the U.A.W. declaration of war . How many autos would G.M. be able to make now ? How many could the industry make ? The U.S. had a big stake in the answers , vastly bigger than the mere desire for new cars . One out of every seven persons in the U.S. depends on the industry in some manner ( rubber workers , filling-station operators , etc. ) for their living . And G.M. was almost half ( 47% ) of the auto industry . <P> On the 24th Floor . The crisis between the world 's biggest union and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would be settled high up on the 24th floor of G.M. 's building near Manhattan 's Columbus Circle . There , in the paneled office of G.M. 's board chairman , Alfred Pritchard Sloan Jr. , all G.M. problems eventually come home to roost.
