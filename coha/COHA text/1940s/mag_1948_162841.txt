Fog had closed in Frankfurt 's Rhine-Main Airport one night last week ; the administration building 's lights could not be seen across the field . Near the runway , in a red and white checkered trailer , three G.I. technicians bent over their separate receivers-Search Scope , Middle Scope , Final Scope . <P> At 5,000 feet , 18 miles away , Search Scope picked up a moving white dot . It was a C-47 from the U.S. Air Force 's Berlin airlift . Carefully watching the calibrations which told him the plane 's altitude , speed and distance , the G.I. at Search Scope called over his microphone to the pilot : " Calling Easy Charlie three nine ... You will descend 500 feet a minute ... Fly two five seven degrees . . . " <P> By now the plane had shown on Middle Scope , whose operator picked up : " Decrease rate of descent to 400 and maintain it constant . . . Lower your landing gear ... " Then Final Scope took over : " Change course to three four eight degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Level off . Steady . . . You 're on the glide path . " <P> Blind Landings . The plane came out of the night , set wheels to concrete . The Army 's GCA ( ground-controlled approach ) had brought another airlift plane safely home . <P> In the two months since it began , the U.S. airlift-now the world 's biggest and busiest airline-had piled up some impressive records . Between June 26 and Aug. 26 it had made 15,853 flights , hauled 100,398 tons of food and other vital supplies to blockaded Berlin . Even more impressive , the planes had shuttled back &; forth during the worst summer Germany had seen in years . Despite all the rain , fog and even sleet , GCA had brought the planes in for 850 blind landings without an accident. * <P> The success of GCA was something for U.S. commercial lines and the Civil Aeronautics Administration to study . Though commercial pilots have generally preferred ILS ( instrument landing system ) because they control landings themselves , many a commercial pilot on airlift duty has now been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When I think of all the hours I 've spent stacked up in the soup over New York , maybe this is the answer . " <P> If it was , U.S. commercial pilots would be a long time getting it . For one thing , Congress has never appropriated enough money for GCA ( which costs about five times as much as ILS ) . For another , CAA is leary of GCA because of possible Government liability in accidents . <P> Steady Flying . Of course , Operation Vittles does not have to count its cost ( $260,000 daily ) , as money-losing U.S. commercial airlines do . Still , it may help U.S. commercial operators solve some problems . <P> By straining the reservoir of U.S. transport planes , it has bolstered the industry 's argument that the Government should share the mounting cost of pioneering new transport types . By getting an average eight-hours-per-day out of each of its 192 planes , it has proved what oldtimers like Eddie Rickenbacker have long preached : that the more a plane is used , the better performance it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week : " Leave a plane on the ground and it starts deteriorating . But keep it in the air , with regular maintenance , and it thrives on steady and prolonged use . " <P> <P> * Of the airlift 's five crashes , five fatalities , none has happened on GCA landings .
