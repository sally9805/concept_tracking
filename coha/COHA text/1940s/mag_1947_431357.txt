 | Wanted : A Miracle in Greece Condensed from Collier 's Paul A. Porter Fortner Presidential Endssary to Greece THE American Mission for Aid to Greece must perform a miracle . The miracle is to save the country from economic disintegration . Last January I went to Greece as head of a mission charged with reporting on the economic situation and determining what assistance would be necessary for the survival of the Greek nation . I know at first hand the discouraging conditions which today confront Dwight Griswold and the mission . And I feel strongly that the American people should know what these conditions are . A peasant I talked with in the lovely Greek countryside typified the Greek national psychosis . He was weary and discouraged , prematurely old , his hands upturned in a gesture of mute despair . " Four times in my lifetime my home has been destroyed , " he said , " ? by the Turks , the Bulgars , the Nazis and the guerrillas . Why should I build it up again ? " From the large textile manufacturers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the people are paralyzed by uncertainty and fear for the future . Businessmen will not invest . Storekeepers will not lay in supplies . One official told me that 150,000 homes had been destroyed and that only 1300 had been rebuilt in 1946 . This despair is crucial , because our whole program is based on the assumption that the people will be able to snap out of their inertia .  | We are not stepping up the amount of assistance much . During 1946 Greece got about $330,000,000 from UNRRA and the British ; our aid of $350,000,000 barely exceeds this . Far from having too liberal an amount of money , we are operating on an exceedingly narrow margin , and it may soon become apparent that additional funds are necessary . Since last January there has been a widespread drought which substantially reduced grain production . Military activity has been stepped up . And our own price level has risen to shade the value of the dollars Congress has made available . Our loan , at best , will get the Greeks up to the minimum reconstruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a level of decent subsistence . If the American mission is to end this national hopelessness it must resolve two controversial situations ? the civil war and the character of the Greek government . You can not devote your full energies to repairing docks , building bridges and maintaining roads when you are likely to be shot in the back any moment . There can be no permanent solution of Greece 's economic future until the present military burden is reduced ? until money and men are released for productive purposes . There can be no permanent solution of Greece 's psychological paralysis until the menace of external aggression is removed . I am convinced the Russians know this even better than we do . The Communists know that the revival of guerrilla warfare will put us on the spot in Greece ? so they are working overtime to revive it . That is why Russia 's U.N . delegate Gromyko vetoed the U. S. proposal to establish a semipermanent frontier commission in the Balkans . The U.S.S.R. does not want a pacification of frontier conditions , for that will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The government which the Greeks themselves put into office must constitute the tools with which we work . Any blatant intervention on our part would supply potent ammunition to Soviet propaganda about American imperialism . But we can ? and must ? do something to sharpen these tools . Chief among them is the Greek civil service , described to me by the late King George of Greece as a kind of pension system for political hacks . The civil service is overexpanded , underpaid and demoralized . The bulk of the Greek civil servants do not get a living wage . Many are forced to supplement their government pay by taking outside jobs . A short working week ? usually mornings only for six days a week ? facilitates this economic double life . The result is complete disorganization ? an administrative structure which , for sheer incompetence and ineffectiveness , is appalling . The civil service can not be relied upon to carry out the simplest functions of government ? the collection of taxes ,  | the enforcement of economic regulations , the repair of roads . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning . There is the far more intricate and explosive question of the political leadership of the country . Whatever they are , the Greek officials who have held the reins since America 's entry into the picture are not totalitarian dictators . There is in Greece a vigorous political opposition . There is a free press . The Communist paper is published daily in Athens , and each morning I received an English translation of the Mimeographed bulletin of the EAM bitterly denouncing the government . The Greek regime is not at all liberty-loving in the American sense , but it is paradise compared to its neighbors of the north and their much vaunted " new democracy . " On the other hand , the Greek leaders ? or most of them ? have shown little inclination to do the things necessary to end their nation 's travail . So far as I could see , the government last January had no effective policy except to plead for foreign aid to keep itself in power . And it intended , in my judgment , to use that aid as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial clique which constitutes the invisible power in Greece . In January and February , desperation had produced a Tate of noble resolutions within the Greek Government ; but the instant effect of the assurance of American aid was not to stimulate the government to further efforts , but to give it the feeling that it was delivered from the necessity of having to do anything at all . So it declared a national holiday ; there was dancing in the streets . And at the same time it shelved a plan for the export of surplus olive oil ? a plan which had stepped on the toes of private traders . The mercantile and banking cabal behind the government is headed by Pesmazogou , governor of the National Bank of Greece . This cabal is determined to protect its financial prerogatives , at whatever expense to the economic health of the country , and to retain a tax system fantastically in its members ' favor . They oppose exchange controls , because such controls might prevent them from salting away their profits in Cairo or Argentina . They would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Today , for example , the Greek merchant marine is enjoying a boom , and the shipowners are raking in profits , mostly out of Liberty ships sold them by the U. S. Maritime Commission after the Greek Government had guaranteed the mortgages . The yearly earnings of a Greek-owned Liberty ship probably run between $200,000 and $250,000 . Of this , only $8000 goes to the government in taxes . Foreign experts have urged the government to raise the tax requirements to about $30,000 . But the political strength of the shipowners has prevented any effective action .  | Insidious pressure will be brought to bear upon the members of the mission by the social lobby ? the smart international set with its headquarters at Cannes , St. Moritz and the Kolonaki Square of Athens . Many of them are charming people , but anxious above all to convert the mission into another means of safeguarding their prerogatives . Against such obstacles , can we succeed in achieving our objectives ? That will depend on what they are . We can not evaluate progress in Greece by usual Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be greatly in the mission 's debt if an atmosphere can be created and maintained wherein the Greek people have an opportunity in the near future for free political choices . This raises the delicate problem of the intervention by one nation in the internal affairs of another . Obviously we can not treat Greece as if it were a conquered country . Yet I feel that the Greek state , in having requested assistance and supervision , is to that extent setting a limitation on its own sovereignty . If we are to invest heavily in Greek recovery it is common sense to suppose that this implies the means to make the recovery effective . To get down to cases , if a Greek minister obstructs measures necessary for Greek recovery , or perverts American aid to antidemocratic purposes , I can not believe that our mission would stand by impotent . The first step in promoting Greek recovery is to end the present internal warfare and to refute the Soviet propaganda that the United States is financing a civil war in Greece . The best means of doing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safeguards to bring out of the hills everyone who is not an outright Communist agent . Then we must follow through on the program of economic reconstruction . By agreement with the Greek Government , the American mission will supervise closely the money spent for this . Then , over a longer period , will come political reconstruction and reform . Such a program can not be put into effect overnight . But once the economic program begins to roll we can do our best to foster elements of the center and the non-Communist left . There have been eight changes in the Greek Government since liberation , but Constantin Tsaldaris , VicePremier and Foreign Minister , and his Populist ( extreme Right ) cohorts remain a powerful force . However , there are democratic resources in Greece which have not yet been fully tapped . Damaskinos , the archbishop of Greece , is a man of massive , disinterested wisdom on political conditions . Sophoulis , the head of the Liberal party , also has great moral stature in the country. * Var-  | varessos , the Greek representative in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and some of the younger politicians , like Kanellopoulos and the younger Venizelos , show promise . Of the forces of real democratic vitality in the country , the agricultural cooperative movement seems unusually robust and promising . The student movement has vigor . And the trade-union movement , if it can be freed from the grip , on the one hand , of government stooges and , on the other , of Communists , - may well develop into a bulwark of democracy . We are facing a situation unprecedented in our history ; we must develop a new and American means of coping with it . The British formula was always collaboration with the native ruling classes ? buying their support by confirming them in their power to exploit the masses . This is not only repugnant to American traditions ; it is impractical . No system would deliver the Greeks more speedily into the arms of the Russians . Russia is standing patiently by , confident that Greek incompetence and reaction combined with American inexperience and gullibility will doom the efforts of the American mission . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple knavery , Russia hopes , that we will grow disgusted and indifferent and finally walk out . Then guess who will walk in ! I think Americans have enough resourcefulness and perseverance to lick the problem . If we are defeated in Greece it will be a crushing moral and strategic blow to our new international-role solar plexus . But , if we can leave Greece in a state of economic and political health , we will have brought new hope and new faith to freedom-loving people everywhere in the world .
