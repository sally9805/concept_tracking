What would keep high-school students from quitting school to take well-paying war jobs ? That was what the U.S. Office of Education asked itself . Last summer the Office set to work to contrive ways &; means for local authorities to keep students in school . Last week the Office reported that it had succeeded beyond its dreams . U.S. high-school enrollment last fall dropped about 6.2%-only about half the expected loss . The Office also reported some of the means by which the trick was turned : <P> In Los Angeles , a high-school " four-four plan " is enabling thousands of pupils to spend four hours daily in school , four on jobs . <P> In Birmingham , pupils in the Paul Hayne Vocational High School spend half of each day on jobs related to their courses , including auto mechanics , beauty culture , tearoom management . <P> In San Francisco , schools grant up to 30 units credit ( spread over three years ) for work experience . <P> In New York City , the 26 vocational schools pursued students by letters , telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs , offered attendance awards . <P> In Berks County , Pa. , a Schools Project Committee of educational , business , agricultural and industrial leaders last spring placed teachers and pupils in jobs with employers who promised to hustle them back to classrooms in September . <P> In Philadelphia , schools developed plans to fill retail-sales jobs on a basis of afternoon work on school days , an eight-hour Saturday stint . Returns to school were up over 1942 . <P> In Cleveland , high-school principals sent letters to pupils just before schools reopened . They pleaded the country 's need of educated citizens , youth 's need of education . Result : Cleveland had more pupils in September than in June , 1943.
