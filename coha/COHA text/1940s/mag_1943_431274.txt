 | Being mother to a healthy young girl is somewhat similar to being a career diplomat . Basically the job consists of handling a series of crucial situations with sufficient skill and perception to prevent them from doing widespread damage . These situations ? as any harassed mother can testify ? cover everything from childhood tantrums to the entire problem of men . Or man ? for one man is especially deadly . Most of your other worries will appear trivial indeed when your daughter announces that she is in love with the young man wh a has been giving you a severe case of jitters ever since he began to call on her . This is a crisis familiar to practically every parent . It is serious , but its outcome need not be . With intelligent handling it may pass without leaving wounds and take its place in your life and in your daughter 's life as just one more emotional tangle that has been skilfully unraveled . Whether or not this happens depends entirely on you ? on your wisdom , your common sense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left to instinct . However firmly you swear by a mother 's intuition , remember that this is one time it may lead you astray . Your most effective weapon is restraint , not the rimitive emotional reaction natural to a woman who is convinced that her daughter is about to throw herself away . Yet most mothers , when faced with the problem , let instinctive : ear override reason . Their prime aim is to get rid of the young man , and they do n't care how they do it . The result is usually a shock to them , because , for some strange reason , young men rarely are alienated by strong maternal disap- proval , whereas daughters frequently are ! Probably the most common mistake , and the greatest waste of energy , is to try to make your daughter see the young man as you see him . Many mothers constantly ridicule the unfortunate suitor , criticize him unmercifully , try to make him appear inferior and vulgar . This never fails to have an effect exactly opposite to the one intended . Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise to the defense of her adored one like a fearless young knight . She will feel glamorously persecuted and will dote on the sensation , especially when there are others around to be impressed with the strength and depth of her love . So this method is futile and usually does more harm than good . Photograph by James Snyder-Pagano If there is any chance at all of your daughter 's seeing that the boy is really not for her , that chance will vanish once you start playing the grim , relentless parent and make her feel like Juliet . Not only must you not ridicule him , you must be always courteous and gracious to him . Anything else will have serious repercussions . If you think you can make your daughter see the light by slighting the boy when he comes to call , you 're going to let yourself in for a few painful surprises . The hurt look in a man 's eyes is a very powerful weapon . All your daughter needs is to see it once , recognize you as the cause , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working on all eight cylinders , and she will bristle at your approach with the same staunch venom @#  | that would greet you were you to molest a baby bear in its mother 's presence . To a woman nothing is more irresistible in a man than the lover-small-boy combination . Movie actors have thrilled millions on just that formula . Another error , equally dangerous , is the appeal to your daughter 's better nature . After all , bringing her up has entailed not a few sacrifices on your part . You 've suffered for her , worked for her . planned for her , all with one though ! only : to make her happy . May you remind her of that ? Perhaps plead : " After all I 've done for you , ca n't you give up this man for me ? " The answer is an unequivocal " No . " Unless you 're ready to take what people get when they stick out their chins . Your daughter 's response to this will he at once passionate and bitter . She vu. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't ask to be born ? and work her way up from tha : point . The net result will be to leave you feeling sick and leave her feeling like a storybook heroine shackled by a selfish . neurotic mother . Some mothers think they are being clever psychologically if they praise other men . They reason that a few well-chosen words of admiration directed at more eligible males will plant seeds of doubt in the daughter 's mind and cause her to look upon her beloved with more critical and measuring eyes . This may happen . It has been known to happen . But the usual effect is to stimulate her sense of loyalty . She will think . with a secret thrill , that hers is a deep and quiet love that no one in the world can understand but herself and Him Other men may be better looking or richer or more interesting ? facts that are only further testimony to her capacity for pure , subtle emotion . IT 'S almost as poor psychology to play on her sense of competition . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got . He 's a prince by co parison . Why ca n't you do as well ? " restrain that impulse . Even if it me biting your tongue . Because nothing y might say is so exquisitely calculated turn her against you and involve h more deeply than ever in the very em tion you seek to destroy . There are three obvious reasons : In the first place , her pride alone v. cause her to defend her choice , si she instinctively rejects the implicate that her taste is inferior . Secondly , her eternal woman 's crag ? for drama will flare up . Talking a other girls ' successes only makes her o love seem pure and romantic , free fr all material considerations . You sim give her the opportunity to be the s in a little private drama . This dra lends glamour and romance to an aff that might , if left alone , wither and of its own dullness . And in the third place , she never forgive you for trying to humiliate by pointing out that the man she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . " It is a parent 's duty build up , not destroy , children 's esteem . Well , what can you do ? Surely ti : must be some concrete steps you can to remedy the situation .  | Actually there are n't many . But there is one ? the most important ? frenzied mothers tend to overlook . Before you do or say anything else , you must win your daughter 's confidence . She must know that she can trust you implicitly , must understand that you 'll never stoop to ridicule or malice or anything underhand and that you are her friend and she can count on you . Naturally , if your relations with her have been somewhat short of the best , this will be more difficult . But if you 've ever yearned for her confidence , ached for her to come to you for advice , this is your big chance . Because this is your chance to show yourself to be a fairminded , sympathetic , understanding woman , whom she can consult without fear of criticism or emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for you . It is a soothing and restraining influence on any girl to know that her parents are right there with her and can be counted on to help if help is needed . And , in addition , a sound relationship based on trust will minimize the chance of her going heavily theatrical and seeing herself as a persecuted ingenue . HOW do you establish this confidence ? Mainly by having a long talk with her in which you declare yourself honestly and lay your cards on the table . You tell her , quietly and sanely , that you do not approve of the young man and that you think she has made a mistake . But you will do nothing to break it up . He may call on her as often as she desires and be assured of a hospitable reception . You understand that she loves him and respect her emotion , even though you disapprove of its object . As woman to woman , she will be responsive to this mood of quiet understanding . You are being fair and decent ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the next step possible : keeping her mind open to other men . You ask her to allow herself the advantage , as a special favor to you , of seeing other men from time to time . You point out that this will keep her point of view from going stale and is the best possible insurance for whatever step she takes in the future . For example , should she finally decide in favor of him ( you explain to her ) , she never will suffer the agonizing doubt of wondering whether she cut herself off from the world too soon . And if she decides against him , hers will be no difficult social comeback , since she has never really been out of circulation and has kept her stream of friends alive . This in itself , if the match is illfavored , should be enough to solve the problem . Because almost every girl is sensible about her emotions and wants to marry the man best fitted to be her husband , not just any girl 's . Left alone , girls usually come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents , they frequently are railroaded into marriages that can end only in mutual misery . After all , it is a common human trait to be antagonized by disapproval , to be stung by censure into going ahead with a project you would prefer deep down in your heart to drop . See to it that your daughter continues to meet other men and have dates with them . Encourage her to attend dances , work at canteens , get herself a job that will hold her interest . Give little parties and invite the man you dislike , and be just as gracious to him as you are to the ARE YOU SUM Of YO ( PRESENT D E0007 TEST IT .

And finally , if none of this bears fruit . if , after the most determined campaigning on your part , she decides that he is the real thing and that she is going to marry him ? why , just grin and bear it . Admit you may be wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not the best judge of her needs and desires . Whether or not you approve of him is unimportant . He may be the one man for her , and she has a right to stick by her decision . Console yourself with the thought that if she loves him so much , he ca n't be too bad . and , instead of alienating her by constant nagging , use that time and energy to try to understand why she loves him . You may be pleasantly surprised . @#
