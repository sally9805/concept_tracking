While Germany wrestled with the Russian Bear last week , Winston Churchill engaged in a game of two-handed Russian wrestling with critics of Britain 's aid-to-Russia program . On his left hand the Prime Minister contended with growing opposition to Britain 's passive war effort ; on his right , with growing Tory opposition to helping Russia at all . <P> In an optimistic speech to Parliament , the Prime Minister , who has promised Russia all possible aid , got around to the Bear rather late . <P> " The magnificent resistance of the Russian Armies , " said he , " makes it certain that Hitler 's hopes of a short war with Russia will be dispelled . Already in three months he has lost more German blood than was shed in any single year of the last war . " <P> 500 Hours . To many Britons even such belated tributes seemed altogether inadequate and passive . They wanted to know , bluntly , why Britain did not get right into the ring where the Bear 's hug was tying up Hitler . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gallipoli campaign of World War I , wondered whether that memory could possibly be making their leader timid . <P> Said the liberal New Statesman and Na tion : " Moscow is not impressed by the expedition to Spitsbergen ( see p. 20 ) . . . . We have command of the sea ; have we not the troops available even for ' beard-singeing ' operations ? Are there no bases worth denying to the enemy ? Uneasiness is inevitable in view of the record of the War Office . . . . " <P> Wrote the London News Chronicle 's Columnist A. J. Cummings : " We have in this country a great idle Army bored to distraction waiting impatiently for the invasion that will never come . " <P> Said Editor John Rutherford Gordon of the Sunday Express : " What is the matter ? Lack of planes ? Lack of tanks ? Lack of rifles ? Lack of men ? Probably we do lack all these things but it seems to me we lack something much more important . That is the offensive attitude of mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If our own military position does not permit of an assault on any single part of Hitler 's 2,000-mile western front , then Russian hopes should not have been raised by the joint telegram from President Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill . . . . Five hundred hours ago ! France crumbled in less time than that . Five hundred hours ! Plenty of time to lose hope . Plenty of time in which to die . " <P> Both Your Houses . In private , many Britons , like Americans , have made no bones of saying that they hoped Germany and Russia would annihilate each other , that both could go to hell . Fortnight ago no less a cog in the aid-to-Russia mechanism than sleek , sporting Minister for Aircraft Production Lieut . Colonel John Theodore Cuthbert Moore-Brabazon was accused by Secretary Jack Tanner of the big Amalgamated Engineering Union of expressing just such sentiments .
