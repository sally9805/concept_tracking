Since U.S. Unitarians changed their chief officer ( in 1938 ) from a President to a Moderator , Unitarian Churches have been headed by a penologist ( Sanford Bates ) , two college presidents ( Mills College 's Aurelia Reinhardt , Toledo University 's Philip C. Nash ) . Last week the American Unitarian Association 's executive committee nominated a Senator-Harold Hitz Burton , co-author of the Ball-Burton-Hatch-Hill resolution ( TIME , March 22 ) . The 55-year-old Senator and three-time mayor of Cleveland will take office at the Unitarians ' annual meeting next May . <P> Senator Burton 's post as Moderator is purely honorary . It will be his duty to represent the 61,000 Unitarians at various functions of note . For this he will receive travel expenses , nothing more . He must also preside over the Unitarian biennial General Conference and keep it moving . Hence Unitarian quipsters say their Moderator might better be called an " Accelerator . "
