txt BLANKET IMMUNITY UNDER TRUST LAWS IS DENIED TO UNIONS District Court at Capital Upholds Indictments in Jurisdictional Case CLAYTON CLAUSE DEFINED Ruling Handed Down as C.I.O. Counsel Gives Conflicting View to High Bench Remota I to THE NEW YORK TIMES . WASHINGTON , March 28 ? Judge Peyton Gordon of the District of Columbia Federal District Court ruled today that labor unions do not enjoy blanket exemption from prosecution under the anti-trust laws .. The ruling ' was regarded as an important victory for the government in its drive against evils in the building industry . It upheld in its first test the use of the Sherman Act against delays resulting from a jurisdictional row Inside one of the great labor organizations . It sustained an indictment against a Washington local of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters , an American Federation of Labor union , and five of its officials , in a dispute with a local of the International Brotherhood of Operating Engineers , also of the A. F. of L. The dispute held up many large government and private construction projects here . Judge Gordon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its officials and denied a motion to quash the charges . The defense received twenty days to plead to the indictment and counsel announced that plans would be made to go to trial soon . Denies ? Blanket Exemption Contentions of A. F. of L. lawyers that the Clayton Act freed labor from prosecution under the Sherman law were swept aside by Judge Gordon . " Section 6 of the Clayton Act does not give , and was not intended to give , to labor organizations , a blanket exemption from the operation of the anti-trust laws , " he ruled . Section 6 , he continued , did legalize the existence and operation of labor organizations and protect union men in carrying out legitimate objects in lawful manner . But , he added , in the present instance , the object of a conspiracy by the defendants was not legitimate , but was to break down collective bargaining between three companies and the engineers union . The government accused the teamsters of a criminal conspiracy to restrain trade . Members of the engineers union , it said , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teamsters union brought forward the contention that its members should have this work . It was charged that the defendants tried to induce companies operating the mixer-trucks to employ members of the teamsters union rather than members of the engineers union ; coerced the companies to break contracts with the Engineers local ; coerced drivers to resign from the engineers local and join the teamsters ; called and assisted in calling strikes on a number of construction projects with a view to stopping construction work and prevent or threaten to prevent deliveries to construction projects by // TRUST IMMUNITY DENIED TO UNIONS // trucks driven by non-members of the Teamsters Union . Dispute Has Been Settled Commenting upon this indictment , Judge Gordon held that the object of the conspiracy was not to obtain higher wages , shorter hours or better labor conditions , but to replace the engineers with the teamsters as drivers of the concrete-mixer trucks . The object of the conspiracy , he added , was to " nullify and break down " the collective bargaining between the engineers and the mixer companies . But even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he continued , " Section 6 of the Clayton Act protects the defendants only when the means which they employ to carry out or attain that object are lawful . " The dispute between the two unions has been settled , the settlement transferring the drivers of the concrete mixers from the Engineers Union to the Teamsters Union , but the government will press the case nevertheless . In another case involving the liability of labor unions , Lee Pressman , general counsel of the Congress of Industrial Organizations , presented to the Supreme Court today a construction of Section 6 of the Clayton act in conflict with that of Judge Gordon . He argued that unions are not subject to the anti-trust statutes except where they " join a combination of employers which commits acts " in violation of the laws . His views were expressed in an amicus curiae brief submitted in the Apex Hosiery case , which is before the court on an appeal by the corporation . $711,932 Verdict at Issue The company obtained a triple damage verdict of $711,932 from the American Federation of Hosiery Workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1937 . Last November the Third Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously set aside this verdict , holding that application of the anti-trust laws was not the legal method of redress in this case . The Circuit Court , however , intimated that the union could be compelled to answer for damages in " the appropriate form , " apparently meaning the State courts , where an action for $1,000,000 damages is pending . Mr. Pressman , in his brief today , asserted : " Unions are not subject to the anti-trust law unless they become part of a combination of employer , which commits acts in violation o. the law . " Section 6 , he stated , clearly pro vides that " unions shall not be help to be combinations in restraint o : trade , " and was written followini the . demands of organized Woo after the 1908 Danbury Hatters de cision in Supreme Court . In the language of Section 6 a : the Clayton Act the C.
