General George Catlett Marshall , Chief of Staff and field commander of the Army , last week made the plea that no politician had dared to make . In his biennial report , publicized with plenty of Page One fanfare , he asked : <P> &gt; Amendment of the laws limiting the service of drafted men , reservists and National Guardsmen to one year . <P> &gt; Amendment of the laws restricting the service of citizen soldiers to the Western Hemisphere . <P> It was high time somebody began to talk on the subject . George Marshall and the Army knew it would have to be done sooner or later . The National Guard outfits longest in service are due to go home on Sept. 15 . The first of the draft recruits will begin to dribble back home two months later . And under present law , the Army could make no move outside the hemisphere without Congress ' say-so , thus advertising its intention to a foe who moves with lightning speed and without warning . This week 's occupation of Iceland was a move the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> George Marshall talked bluntly , as a soldier should . What he had to say about extending the one-year draft period could be boiled down to a terrifyingly simple conclusion : Unless the citizen soldiers now in the Army are kept there , the U.S. will have to rub out what it has done and start over again . For , in expanding the field Army from some 210,000 regulars ( Sept. 1 , 1939 ) to 1,448,500 ( last week ) , the staff has had to spread its three-year professionals perilously thin . Only two divisions ( First and Third ) are now made up exclusively of three-year enlisted soldiers . The rest are compounds of draftees , reserve officers , regulars . In the 18 National Guard divisions , bulk of the Army 's man power , the complication is worse . In all the 15 regular divisions ( including Armored Force ) , 75% to 90% of the officers are reservists . Recall under the one-year law would put these divisions out of business . <P> " In the light of the situation , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests are imperiled . . . . Whatever we do for the national defense should be done in the most efficient manner . Differences of views regarding national policy should not , it seems to me , be permitted to obscure the facts relating to the preparation of the armed forces for service . . . . " <P> Of Congress General Marshall asked one more favor , which he will get with less debate . He wanted quick passage of the bill , now before Congress , that will give teeth to the clean-out of inept officers from the regular Army . <P> That request of George Marshall 's drew no fire from legislators , for regulars swing no political cats . But his other requests produced plenty of fireworks from such lawmakers as Burton Wheeler , Hiram Johnson , Charles McNary . Best guess at week 's end was that Congress would wait to hear what the public and Franklin D. Roosevelt had to add .
