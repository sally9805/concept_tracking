txt As word reached the War Labor Board today that a large number of the " wildcat " strikers were still absent from coal mines of Alabama and Indiana , the board announced that at the request of the Appalachian operators it would hold a public hearing on Thursday to listen to arguments on the proposed supplemental wage contract , arranged by the United Mine Workers of America and the Illinois Coal Operators Associations . Soon after this announcement came out , the spokesmen for the Appalachian operators issued a statement rejecting the tennis of the proposed agreement which John L. Lewis informed the board Saturday would be the basis for a country-wide contract if the board approved it . The operators asserted that the Illinois agreement was " a subterfuge " which covered a " hidden wage increase " of $1.83 a day , which , added to the 25 cents already awarded the miners by the NWLB , would " exceed the amount originally asked by Mr. Lewis . " Watch for Strike Pressure While the statement was being issued it was reported at the WLB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be related to pressure for the board to approve the proposed Illinois contract the board would probably not hold the hearings until the men were back at work . The board 's practice is not to consider a case " at the point of a gun . " According to reports from the striking areas , the miners were refusing to attend meetings lest they incur the penalties of the Connally-Smith act and they had somehow set up some form of a " silent understanding " with each other whereby they did not even need to speak , but would act as individuals as long as their wage grievances were not redressed . At the Illinois headquarters of the union in Springfield , Ray Edmondson , State president , declared that " somebody in Washington is tapping our office telephones and my home phone . " " They listen when I call my wife , or when I call my friends and business associates , " he declared . The Appalachian operators , in their ten-point statement today , asserted that the proposed Illinois agreement would not increase but would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was asserted , Would amount to more than 50 cents a ton , or , an additional $300,000,000 a year- added to consumer bills . - In some districts the increased cost , it was alleged , would be 60 cents a ton . Declaring that the proposed agreement would " completely revolutionize the basis upon which wages have hitherto been paid in the industry , namely from ' face to face ' to ' portal to portal , " the statement said that the present wage scale - Carried-  - with it pay of $1.50 more for underground than for surface workers . The Illinois agreement , the operators ' group said , proposed to pay this greater sum , plus an additional $1.83 a day , and in addition also provied that outside men be paid an additional hour 's time " whether or not they have work to perform " and this " would constitute a straight wage increase . " The Illinois agreement , according to the operators , " destroys nearly all of the functions and authority of management to direct the working forces and to manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the operators said of the proposed Illinois wages , " certainly must wipe out the effect of the ' hold the line ' order of April 8 , 1943 , and destroy all efforts of the Office of Economic Stabilization to hold wages in line with prices . " Meanwhile , Secretary Ickes , as Solid Fuels Coordinator , reporting critical shortages of coal for household use in several areas , disclosed that most of the bituminous mines east of the Mississippi have been ordered to divert one day 's output this week , exclusive of industrial types , to " all-rail " retailers from whom them now have orders that are unfilled . The order affects more than 1,800 mines and 300,000 to 400,000 tons of coal in prepared sizes . " All-rail " retailers are those who get their coal by rail without any transshipments by truck . Retailers have been delayed in receiving their orders because coal has been flowing in large quantities to war plants and to Great Lakes docks for shipment before winter closes the lakes . The Solid Fuels Administration said most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi .
