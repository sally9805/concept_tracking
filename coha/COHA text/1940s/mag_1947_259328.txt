Finally the whole business was settled in secret meeting by the leaders of the two parties . The deal was that the new Congress would meet this week and confirm Dr. Enrique Hertzog , 49 , as successor to the late , lynched Dictator-President Gualberto Villarroel . Hertzog had beat Luis Fernando Guachalla by only 289 votes in the January elections . In return for the settlement made with Guachalla and followers all challenged Guachalla congressmen were to be seated , thus assuring the Guachallistas of at least a fair chance of controlling the new Parliament . Hertzog promised to invite his friend and rival to join his Government and help him deal with such pressing matters as a new tin miners ' strike , an Argentine proposal for a trade treaty like the one Peron made with Chile ( TIME , Dec. 23 ) and a flood in tropical Beni province ( where alligators had chased the flood victims into the tree tops ) . <P> Fighting Surgeon . Tough , nervous , French-descended Hertzog served as a regimental surgeon on front-line duty in the Chaco war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven times , exiled six . Once , he was horsewhipped , burned , bayonetted and thrown bleeding on his cell floor . But when other prisoners marched by , he rose , put on his coat and stuck a flower in his buttonhole to show them he was still all right . He collects colonial paintings , admires Harold Laski , and says he is so healthy he can " eat bricks fried in automobile oil . " <P> Hertzog will have more than alligators to worry about . The night after the peace meeting , Guachalla and Hertzog followers rioted in front of the Congress building . One Hertzog man fell and his fellows , thinking him dead , paraded through the streets with the body to cry shame upon the Guachallistas . Later they found the victim was only wounded . He died late that night in the emergency hospital .
