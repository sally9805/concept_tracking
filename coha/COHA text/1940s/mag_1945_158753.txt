This week the San Francisco conference put the last dots on a charter written for a world of power , tempered by a little reason . It was a document produced by and designed for great concentrations of force , somewhat restrained by a great distrust of force . <P> Would it work ? The best answer was given three weeks ago by Secretary of State Edward R. Stettinius Jr. : " Will it keep the peace ? That depends upon the will to peace with which the nations of the world support the charter and build strength into the world organization . We can do no more at San Francisco than to establish the constitutional basis upon which the world can live without war-if it will . " Preamble &; Purposes . The original charter drafted at Dumbarton Oaks by the U.S. , Britain , Russia and China had no preamble , hardly a mention of justice , almost no hint of human aspirations . It was the lowest common denominator of Big Power concessions . The charter writ ten at San Francisco contains a significant but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all states is solemnly affirmed , although the whole structure of the organization denies it . <P> Sovereignty , pervading San Francisco , dictated the charter 's principle of " domestic jurisdiction . " Under it , the world organization may reach into a country to get at the causes of war only when all the Big Powers agree that world peace is en dangered . The section finally agreed on gives a future Hitler a little less chance to prevent intervention simply by assert ing that his policies are " domestic . " The principle of domestic jurisdiction bore importantly on future colonial questions , and Britain insisted on the restriction . <P> Membership . Cordell Hull 's beloved phrase , " peace-loving states , " stayed in . Such nonmember neutrals as Sweden , Switzerland and Portugal , such former Axis satellites as Bulgaria and Rumania can come in only when the Security Council recommends their admission and the General Assembly approves . Members may be suspended but not expelled . Withdrawal is neither provided for nor for bidden ( any member could resign from the League of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be the focus of talk and of hope - but not of power . In it each nation , great or small , has one vote . In this fact lies the Assembly 's importance by the test of equality and its weakness by the test of power reality . A majority vote in the Assembly might be made up of nations which , at a showdown , could not enforce their will on any one of the Big Three . <P> Yet the Big Powers at the conference yielded on many points to expand the Assembly 's functions . The Assembly can discuss anything . It can make recommendations for the peaceful adjustment of situations which might impair peace " regardless of origin . " The only exception - and an important one - is that the Assembly can not recommend action on matters already taken up by the Security Council . <P> The Assembly must rely on its ability to mobilize world public opinion . One proof that this ability can be effective was the care with which the Big Three scrutinized every small-power proposal to broaden the Assembly 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies , of which the Economic and Social Council undoubtedly will be the most potent .
