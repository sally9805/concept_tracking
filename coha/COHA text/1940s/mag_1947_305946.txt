While Congress bickered , Harry Truman had slipped away to Key West for a holiday . This week , as the House prepared to vote on interim aid , the President was back . With the bounce restored to his step , he buckled down to prepare his message to Congress on the long-range European Recovery Program . <P> The President had been tired . At the Commandant 's jalousied house on Key West 's submarine base-which Harry Truman now calls the " Winter White House " - the President had found privacy and relaxation . He slept late ( for him ) , until after seven , napped in the afternoons , sunbathed on the beach . With a movie camera recently given him by White House photographers , he took pictures of the donors and members of his staff , enjoyed the shooting . <P> He flew over to the Florida mainland for the dedication of the Everglades as the U.S. 's 28th ( and eleventh largest ) national park .

Caldwell formally turned over to the U.S. Government 270,720 acres of the Everglades ' sawgrass flats , jungly hummocks , winding waterways and mangrove swamps .

" <P> At Sunday services at the nondenominational Chapel on the base , just before his holiday ended , he found a poem on the program : " Be strong : We are not here to play , to dream , to drift ; we have hard work to do , and loads to lift . " Next day he returned to a rainy Washington . <P> Before going to Key West , Harry Truman had taken time off to dedicate a new children 's wing of the Georgetown University Hospital . There he dropped in on three-year-old Sharon Meenehan , the victim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs in casts held straight up by overhead pulleys , was disappointed . She thought her mother had told her that " a present " was coming , not a " President . " Next day , Harry Truman sent her a Mother Goose book . He wrote on the flyleaf : " Here 's the present you thought you were getting . Get well in a hurry . "
