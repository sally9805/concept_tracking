THE MONEYMAN Valerie hesitated before answering . " Madame Maret did not think so . The sheet in which I was wrapped was not of dowlas but of the very finest linen . " " Was the woman a peasant ? " " It seemed so . Madame Maret said she was plainly dressed and that her hands were large and rough . She was young and of a heavy build . " " She was being paid as a wet nurse . Everything points to that . " " We always believed so . But now there 's no way of finding out any- thing more . They , the Marets , went back to the village six months later to make inquiries . It was still deserted and so they learned nothing . " " And they did n't go back a second time ? " The girl shook her head . " No , my lord . It 's my belief they did n't want to find out anything after I began to grow up . They thought of me as their own child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been told . I could hear them quarreling about it after they thought I had gone to sleep . She said to him that he had been willing enough once to get a reward for returning me but he said that was at first . He had changed his mind . " D'Arlay remained silent for several moments , turning over what he had heard . " Is that all you know ? " he asked finally . " Madame Maret did n't have time to notice anything more . The roof of the church was blazing and so she picked up the basket and left at once . She saw that the woman was swarthy and that blood was running from a wound on her face . 1 curled my hand around her thumb while she carried me to the chart . And that 's all .

" She responded in an eager voice : " I intend to when the chance comes . I dream about it all the time . I 'm sure in my own mind that the poor woman who was killed was not my mother . Who could my real mother have been ? Is she still alive ? If so , does she have any suspicion that I 'm living also ? Would she claim me if she knew ? " " There 's one way itr which I might help you . You remind me of some- one I know . " " Who is it , my lord ? " " I do n't know . All evening I 've been trying to remember but I have n't succeeded . " THE MONEYMAN 41 " And you think it might lead to finding out who I am ? " She was lookingup at him with the most intense and eager interest . " Could it be a relative ? A sister ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shake of warning . " It wo n't be wise to build any hopes or expectations on it . The closest resemblances can be accidental . There 's a man in Paris who looks so much like me that we might be thought twins .

" " But " She was far from content to leave the matter there . " Is there nothing to be done ? I have a conviction , my lord , that I would learn who I am if you could remember . " " It will come to me soon , I 'm certain . " He got to his feet with some difficulty . The energy he had expended in unaccustomed toil had stiffened the muscles of his back and arms . " All I can do for you now , Mademoiselle , is to finish arrangements for the burying of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the truth . Do you feel equal to further effort tonight ? " Valerie rose promptly . " Of course , my lord . " An hour later he drove in the last nail . He thought , " I must contrive to give some small note of grace to this crude and clumsy thing , " and began to carve a Latin text on the lid . He had succeeded as far as Nil nisi bonuin when he glanced at his companion who was standing close by him to watch . He read both absorption and gratitude on her face . " What does it mean ? " she asked . " I 'm a poor scholar , but if my memory and my spelling are not at fault , it will mean , when I am through , something to this effect , Think only good of the dead . Do you approve of my choice ? " " Oh yes , my lord ! I 'm sure he would be grateful too , and proud , if he could see it . " Spurred on by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carve some roses , and perhaps an angel with spread wings , when I finish the text . " He did n't go right back to work , however . The flicker of light across her face again stirred his desire to solve the matter of the resemblance . He said , " Stand over here where I can see you better . " Dropping the ax , he placed a hand on each of her shoulders and proceeded to study her face with complete absorption . He now perceived things about her which had escaped him before . Her fairness was of the kind which comes from the effect of the sun . It was as though its rays had become imprisoned in her skin and hair ; and so she42 THE MONEYMANhad none of the fragile and flowerlike prettiness of gold and pink and white but displayed instead a molten quality , the vitality and radiance of the sun itself . He could not be sure of the color of her eyes . They were , he thought , blue , a very light blue . But it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . He realized that the distinctive quality of her looks came from her eyes . " A most unusual kind of loveliness , " he thought . " It should be easy to remember who it reminds me of . And yet it still eludes me . " Then , without knowing why he had stopped or when , he was thinking no longer of that point . He had been completely carried away . He was conscious only of the curious charm of the face turned up to his . Her eyes ( how could he have believed that another pair like them existed ? ) held him in such subjection , such thrall , that he had forgotten everything else . " What has come over me ? " he asked himself . " Have I fallen under a spell ? " He felt an almost uncontrollable impulse to draw her into his arms . He said to himself , " I 'm afraid that I 'm falling in love , " and this thought helped him to resist the temptation . He dropped his hands from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to fall in love . There were the best of reasons why it would not do . He said to Valerie , " I must finish the carving , " but to himself he was saying , " As slum as we 've buried this poor actor fellow in the morning , I must be on my way . " Chapter IIITHE glove was up ! It was suspended over the gates of the city as a sign that a fair was being held . For the time it remained there , ordinary affairs would he forgotten . In the daytime people would trade in the booths set up along the streets and in the evenings there would be feastingand drinking and dancing , and merrymaking in general . Valerie experienced a nostalgic feeling as soon as she came in through the gates . Fairs had always been the high spots in her not-too-gay existence . They had meant parts for Damian Maret and money once more in theTHE MONEY MAN 43family purse and , perhaps , a new dress for her or a hat or , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stage was being erected on the main square , with a block and tackle for the Ascension and a curtain on rings , she said to herself , " If poor Father were alive he might be picked at last to play the Part and he would be stamping up and down this very minute rehearsing his lines or he would be shouting to me to know if I had unpacked his costumes and wigs . " She sighed , however , when the realization came to her that Damian Maret more likely would be in one of the taverns , drinking in advance to the success he hoped to achieve . The errand which brought her here was in no sense a festive one . After the burial service and the departure thereafter of the Sire d'Arlay ( she had been sorry to see him go and had wondered why such haste was necessary ) , she had known that the time had come to strike out on her own . Pregent Kennedy , who had sold the mules for a good figure , had given her sound advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had pointed out : she must get married , and to a middle-aged husband , one with plenty of gold in the chest he would use for the headboard of his bed , and the capacity , which only an elderly spouse would have , of appreciating her good looks . As the best chance of finding such a husband was to go where the most men were to be found , she must accompany him to Paris . If the right kind of husband did not put in an appearance , there was always the certainty that a place of some kind could be found for her in one of the many establishments conducted by Jacques Coeur . The Scot 's purpose in going to Paris was to see Jaquet the Fox and , of course , a word from him would suffice . Valerie did n't want to go to Paris . Damian Maret had been afraid of the city . Perhaps he had heard so much of the greatness of the actors that he had secretly lacked the courage for such competition ; perhaps he dreaded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate , although he talked loudly and overmuch of invading Paris and setting it agog with the splendor of his talents , he had always found some reason at the last moment for not going . His fears had been communicated to Valerie . She thought of the city on the Seine as a great walled prison . She had heard more of the bodies swinging in chains at Montfauconthan of the beneficent shadow of Notre Dame . Furthermore , she had lived all her life on the edge of destitution and one thing she had learned was that rosy hopes and expectations such as the Scot was holding out could easily be blasted . She had thought of a plan of her own which would be surer and safer . Accordingly she had listened44 THE MONEYMANrespectfully to Kennedy 's arguments and then she had quietly packed up and disappeared . She was carrying a bundle of clothes in one hand and a basket in the other as she made her way through the crowded town . She kept her eyes wide open and was the first to jump to one side and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came galloping at top speed down the narrow cobbled street . A murmur of curses rose around her as the knights disappeared and she saw nothing but faces black with hate . This was not new to her . Those who travel the roads and know the people of the spittal-houses and the slums learn all about their hates and fears . She saw a tall blond youth in a shining hauberk and with a bill on his shoulder come striding through the crowd , whistling with easy confidence . The people made way , knowing him to be English from the leopards on his scarf . They would not have been so ready to respect the truce had they known the air he was whistling was the campaign song of the days of the great English victories , " Sir Robert Knowles All France Controls . " Valerie looked at him in fear and wonder and took pains to make sure that he had nothing in the way of a tail . Most of the people of France , who knew the invaders by reputation only , were sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description . She stopped beside a friendly looking citizen in the flat cap of a vintner to ask , " Can you tell mc , Monsieur , where the Giglet fair is being held ? " The man motioned over his shoulder . " In the yard of the next inn back , minikin , " he said . Then he noticed the bundle and basket . " If you 're thinking of offering yourself , you 'll have to hurry . It 's nearly over . They tell me the Petit Gaste is still to be suited . Take a hint and do n't sign with him . " The innyard was crowded still and there was much chattering and laughing going on . The blue flag had been hoisted on a low platform and the clerk sitting under it was striving to inject a lively note into the proceedings by a continuous monologue . " The Giglet fair is open ! " he intoned . " Want you good servants , Messires and ladies ? We have . a number here for your inspection and questioning . Look them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs and not for gaping-seed . The men are strong and the women are diligent and neat . Look at them , Messires , standing there in youthful innocence and confusion at being forced to parade themselves in public . THE MONEYMAN 45Never have we offered a better lot than you see before you today . Come up and make your selections ! " " The same lot , year after year , " complained a merchant . He glared up at the clerk . " They 're misfits , and well you know it . You know how poor they are when the Petit Gaste ca n't find one to suit him . They 're doddypolls , these , or they 're lazy , or dishonest . " The candidates were standing on benches along each side of the yard , the men on one and the girls on the other . If they were covered with confusion or filled with youthful innocence , there was nothing on the surface to indicate it . Rather , they seemed to be enjoying themselves on this , their one day to strut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety with the spectators . Each wore a placard with a number lettered on it . The spectators clearly were of the opinion that the matter in hand was part of the entertainment of the fair . There was a continual offering of witticisms . " Jacques , " shouted one , " you 'll have the Petit Gaste as your master if you do n't find another soon . He 'll cure you of sitting around on your fat blind-cheeks . " Another raised a laugh by suggesting : " Flip up your skirts , Margot , and let them see your fat calves ; that will get you hired if anything will . " Valerie 's confidence in her plan had received a severe shock by this time . She looked about her and wondered if she could go on with it . The prospective masters , walking up and down the line and inspecting the candidates with a callous air , seemed to her as poor a lot as the candidates themselves . She had to fight down a wild desire to turn and leave while there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercer at this point tossed a coin in the direction of the girl Margot . To catch it would be to accept engagement . Margot did not lose a moment in reaching up and plucking it from the air . After biting it , with an impudent flash of eye for his benefit , she raised her outer skirt and dropped the coin into the pocket of the scarlet kirtle she wore underneath . Then she followed the custom of the fair by removing her placard and handing it to the clerk . The latter went into brisk action . " Good Master Bellay , " he said , " you 've hired yourself a servant . It 's affirmed that she 's in good health , has no trace of contagion about her , and that she 's not with child . If it should happen that a child is born at any time within nine months , it will not be your responsibility . After that  --  he , he !  --  it will be a different matter . If you find it necessary to beat her , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumb and it must be limited to ten strokes . You will provide her with one warm dress of woolen material , a sleeping shift , two pairs of hose , and a cap . She will have four ounces of soap for the six months . You will pay her one denier a day . " " Agreed , " said the mercer . In accordance with custom , the girl said , " I accept you as my master for six months , and I promise obedience , and I will do every task set me with willing spirit . " Valerie had succeeded in edging up close to the platform . She now plucked nervously at the sleeve of the official in charge and said , " I desire to offer myself as a servant , Master Clerk . " The clerk was busying himself with a paper and did not look up . " Very well , " he said . " I 've no time to question you now but it can be done later . Get yourself up on the bench and , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chanced to look at her and his mouth gaped open with surprise . " St. Christophe ! It wo n't be necessary for you to smile , my girl . You may get too good a master if you do . " He handed her a placard with the number sixteen , uttering a feeble joke , " Your age , no doubt , my little one . " Valerie pinned it on the front of her cloak . Then she mounted to an empty section of the bench . The appearance of a new candidate so late in the fair created something of a stir . The would he employers moved forward with one accord to look her over . Painfully aware of the avid eyes which roved over her from head to loot , she clenched her hands and her lips in an effort to hold her feelings in control . She looked fixedly at the top of the innyard gates where a flimsy pirouette jerked about in the wind . As soon as she entered she had noticed a man of unusual size who was prowling about and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became acutely conscious of him for he had shouldered his wav to the front rank and was staring at her like a tomcat at a caged bird . l pis exertions had brought out large globules of perspiration on his round face , making him look like a wax statue which was starting to melt . Someone safely in the rear shouted : " Flow do you like her , Red Fins ? " ( An allusion to the custom butchers had of painting the fins of stale fish to make them seem fresh . ) " Are you suited now ? " The unpleasant apparition began to speak in a high-pitched voice , addressing the company at large . " You say the Petit Gaste is hard to suit . Well , I 'm suited now . This little chick is mine . I 'll have you all notice that I 'm the first to put in a claim . " THE MONEYMAN 97This evoked an instant chorus of protest . " Wait , she suits me ! " cried one man . " I want her myself , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which marks the approach of the late forties , at the most favorable reckoning , said , " It will be for the girl to decide . " The large man shoved his competitors back with an outward sweep of both arms . He scowled about him ferociously . " Any one of you who moves an inch closer will feel the weight of my hand , " he announced . He looked up at Valerie ( his head was almost level with hers as it was ) with mounting approval . " I spoke first . But everyone knows that I 'm a decent man and a fair one . You will all have a chance , even though I could knock your heads together and cave in your ribs and tweeze off your ears with one twist of my fingers ! " He brushed his damp forehead with a grimy forearm . " We 'll draw for her , my good fellow townsmen . Could anything be fairer than that ? Here , Alain-All-Alone , a broom ! " When the inn servant had obeyed the command by producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen straws of different lengths . He glanced about him until his eyes lighted on a shrinking little individual at the edge of the crowd . " You , Godenotte , come here ! " " Not me , Gaste ! Please , not me ! " " Come here ! " roared the big mar , in a sudden fury . " Did n't you hear me right ? Come at once or I 'll tear out your teeth and use them to curry my mules ! " The small man came forward so slowly that the butcher reached out impatiently and yanked him the rest of the way . " All I want you to do , Calf-Lolly , is hold the straws . Here ! Double your puny fist over them so that only the ends show . Now we 'll see who 's to be the lucky man . " Godenotte did as he was bade . One of the claimants , with more boldnessthan the rest , came forward with outstretched fist . Little Gaste stared at him for a moment in amazement and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take first draw when I am giving you this chance out of the goodness of my heart ? I shall have first draw myself . " The giant gripped the wrist of Godenotte so tightly that the fingers curled up under the pressure , revealing the lengths of the straws . Gaste examined them carefully before making his selection . " And , now , the rest of you . " Afraid to cross him , each one of the claimants went through the farce of drawing a straw . Then the lengths were compared and the Petit Gaste was declared the winner . He looked about him with increased bellicosity. 48 THE MONEYMAN " Are you all satisfied ? " he demanded . " Was it a fair draw ? " Those nearest him , and thus the most exposed to danger , nodded at once and said , " Yes , it was fair . " He had hoped , apparently , to meet with some dissent . He looked now at those who stood in the rear and picked on one of them , a young fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mouth , Olim , " he exclaimed . Stalking over , he proceeded to shake the victim with a pistonlike movement of his muscular arms . " Are you content , Olim ? Are you , Olim ? Say that you are , hulverhead , or I 'll wrench your giblets loose ! " He gave the young man a final shake and then sent him sprawling with a shove . " Ohm is content , " he said , grinning about him . The butcher turned then to look at the girl he could now claim as a servant without any hint of opposition . A blank look came over his face . The section of bench she had occupied was empty . Valerie , watching the proceedings with feelings which can readily be imagined , had realized that she would have no chance to find employmentunless she were prepared to accept the Petit Gaste as her master and this , needless to state , was a prospect she could not face . Taking advantage of the fact that the attention of everyone was focused on the drawing , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the triumphant butcher turned to claim her , she was already on her way to tlhe entrance of the courtyard . The Petit ( ; rite caught a glimpse of her and started in pursuit . Valerie fell into , a panic when she realized this . She began to run in blind haste , saying to herself , " It was madness to come here ! " Wheeling suddenly to escape his outstretched paw , she ran into the side of the platform . It collapsed with at loud crash and she caught a glimpse of the clerk 's heels high in the air as he went over with it . A sound of breaking crockery made it evident that a jug of wine which had been on the platform had come to grief. 2As usual a court had been set up to settle any disputes which might arise during the time the fair lasted . It was called Pied Poudre ( in England , where they followed the same plan , the name was corrupted to Pie Powder ) and it was quite literally a court of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from great distances . The judge was a trader in silks from Marseilles . an elderly man with a shrewd and kindly face . THE MONEYMAN 49The judge smiled as he said to the group assembled in front of him , " But it 's clear , Messires , that it was an accident . " " A costly accident for me , " whined the clerk of the Giglet fair who appeared as the complainant . " The girl was frightened , " went on the old judge . " She did not want to be claimed by the Petit Gaste , which is easy to understand . That she overturned the platform was unfortunate , I grant you , but there was no intent in it . " " I 've suffered heavy losses , " declared the clerk . " Item , a valuable jug , broken . Item , a gallon of good wine , spilled . Item , a rent in my cloak , suffered in the fall . Must I , the victim of the mishap , assume this threefoldloss ? " The judge asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered claimingdamages from the Petit Gaste ? " " No ! " answered the complainant hastily . " I did n't deem it likely . The Petit Gaste might display a slight tendency to violence under such circumstances . I hinted earlier to the one officer this court possesses for the carrying out of its decisions that it might be necessary to collect from that  --  that amiable citizen . I was informed he would rather lose his post than make any such attempt . In any event , the legal claim on the worthy , if somewhat hasty , butcher is a slight one . " He reached out for a paper the clerk was clutching in his hand . " You have the amounts there ? Let me have it . " " Thirty-four deniers , " he announced after studying it . He glanced down at Valerie who was standing in front of him with a forlorn look on her face . " It seems , my child , that you have created a loss amounting to that sum . Are you in a position to pay it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she answered in a frightened tone of voice . " Have you anything to offer by way of compensation ? Can you pay a part of it ? " " I have no more than two deniers , my lord judge . " The judge looked about him . " I am reluctant to send this child to prison " he began . Valerie caught her breath . She was under no illusions as to what a term in prison would mean . She would be thrown into one large cell with other prisoners ( in the smaller towns the sexes were not separated ) and there she would stay until her time was up , subsisting on the foulest food and exposed to every kind of disease . She knew that when poor people went to prison they were seldom the same afterward . She looked up with frantic appeal into the gentle face of the old judge. 50 THE MONEYMANHe was continuing : "  --  or to order that she work long enough to pay the amount of the damages , inasmuch as that would mean entering the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community in the matter of flesh and fowl . May I suggest that all present , including myself , make a donation and that the amount thus raised he accepted by you , Monsieur Clerk , as payment in full ? " The silence which followed this suggestion was a conclusive answer . The judge sighed . " I had hoped to strike a spark of generosity in your hearts , Messires , " he said . " Having failed in that , I am under the necessity of A voice spoke up from the rear of the courtroom . " I 'll pay for her . " Valerie turned eagerly . The voice had a familiar ring to it and she was infinitely relieved to find that it belonged to Pregent Kennedy . The Scot came forward slowly , casting her a side glance as he passed which said as plain as words , " Now do you see how foolish you have been and what I am compelled to pay for your folly ? " " I know this girl , " he said to the court . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her sent to prison . But first I must cast an eye over the items on the bill of damages . " " Naturally , " said the judge , handing over the paper . " It 's clear , " declared the Scot , flourishing the paper after a quick survey of what it contained , " that the claimant has been guided by the promptings of hopes and , even , cupidity , rather than a sense of honesty and justice in fixing his estimates . What ! Can it be that the wine which was spilled was costly Cyprus or Tokay ? Did it come from the slopes of Lebanon and did flakes of gold float in its clear amber ? Was the jug itself a chalice fit for the lips of a princess or a holy saint that he sets this absurd value on it ? Monsieur Judge , I am a good whittler and this statement of claims will be like a willow wand in my hands . " Valerie felt a sudden weakness in her knees and , with a nod to the judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the side of the room where she seated herself . She watched the proceedings from there with a sense of relief so great that the leathery face of the Scot - became to her like that of a guardian angel filled with wisdom and benevolence . She heard him brushing aside the passionate protestations of the clerk with a coldness of logic which reduced the claim to shreds . " Seventeen deniers ! " announced the judge , after an agreement had finally been reached . " ' Phis worthy soldier of an allied nation has been generous enough to pay that amount and so I am happy to declareTHE MONEYMAN 51the incident closed . May I add that I hope the Giglet fair will conclude with the Petit Gaste still unsuited . " Pregent Kennedy was honest enough to disclaim any undue credit when he escorted Valerie to the street . " I 've a liking for you , minikin , " he said . " But I 'm compelled to tell you that it might have taken more than that to involve me in such a disastrous transaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he was compelled to fall back on his native tongue for the right word  --  " with my siller . There are other reasons for this seeming madness on my part . The Sire d'Arlay , who has a share of the wealth the Moneyman has created , left a sum in my hands to be used in just such an emergency . Further , I confess , minikin , that I was not as fast asleep that night as I appeared and so I heard what you were telling him about the mystery of your birth . " When Valerie looked startled , he went on in a reassuring tone : " Your secret is safe with me . Nay , I think you lucky that I know . Let me help you , my child , and I 'll dig out the truth for you like a dog with a long-buried bone . " " I 'll be most happy to have your aid , " said Valerie . The Scot nodded his head . " I 'm an honest man and I want you to understand at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instincts . I 'm not above taking advantage of this to add to the weight of my purse . There must always be a souldie for me in everything I do . " He looked at his companion with a dry smile . " Do you think you can unravel the secret if you sell yourself into service with butchers and the like ? Nay , child , you must be prepared for bolder courses than that . Come with me to Paris and we will make a start on things from there . " " I 'm ready to go , " answered Valerie humbly . Chapter IVrTHERE was a small section cut off by a low oak screen from the rest of the white-plastered room . Here , on benches against the wall , visitors waited the convenience of Jacques Coeur . The screen was not high enough to prevent them from seeing the great merchant himself as he sat behind his desk , and so the period of waiting served a double purpose . The visitors achieved a proper appreciation of the demands on his time52 THE MONEYMANbefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desired , he could look them over and give them a quick appraisal in advance . " Who are out there today ? " Coeur asked Nicolas , not raising his eyes from the papers in front of him . " A dowsy lot , " answered the servant . " Gerhart the fuller . He wants to wheedle you about the debt he owes you . I hope you heat his ears for him . A priest from the University ; he 'll be begging for something . A pilgrim who says he 's just back from the Holy Land and has a splinter of the Cross to sell . A fakir , that one . " " Tell Gerhart to come back another day . I 'll see the priest as soon as I can . Send the pilgrim away . Who else ? " " A soldier who calls himself Pregent Kennedy . He talks with a foreign twist . Ecossais , I think . " " Pregent Kennedy ?

" " A girl ? Well , go on . What does she want ? " Nicolas was smiling wisely . " I do n't know what she wants , master . " " If she 's here to beg , give her something from the alms bag and send her away . " " In that case you had better have the Lombardy banker up . He 's waiting your convenience below . " " Why did n't you say so at first ? Filling my ears with talk about this catch of small sprate when the big fish is waiting ! " Before departing to obey the order , Nicolas said in an aggrieved tone , " You know I always save the best for the last . " On the other side of the railing Valerie was watching the great man with fascinated interest . At the same time she was uncomfortably conscious of the close scrutiny of the other visitors and was careful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not wanting anyone to see how dilapidated her shoes had become . She had placed a small wicker basket on the floor beside her . Pregent Kennedy leaned toward her and whispered , " What is there about Jaquet the Fox which interests you so much ? " " His eyes , " she answered in a low tone . " I 'm sure he can see right through me . And yet they 're so kind and understanding . I think he must be a wonderful man . " THE MONEYMAN 53 " Wonderful ? " The Scot peered across the screen at the Moneyman with a dry smile on his long features . " Aye , he 's wonderful  --  in his own way . Hard , acquisitive , sharp . His mind 's as nimble as a ropedancer . " Nicolas entered , escorting a weazened old man in a plain gray gown which swept the floor as he walked . The arms of the newcomer were folded under his chin as though to provide a rest for his palsied head . " A banker , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered the Scot . " Now watch how quickly that old frame of bones will be allowed to ice the great Jacques Coeur . " " I 've thought it over , " said the banker , when he had seated himself across the table from the Moneyman . " Ten of the estates I must have , Jacques Coeur . The list is here . I have put Beaucaire at the head . BeauwireI must have most certainly . " Coeur looked at the little man with a bitter frown . " I have thirty-two estates in which most of my profits have been sunk , " he said . " And you , leech from Lombardy , are demanding ten of them as security for this miserable little loan you 're making me . The lands you demand would ' spay the loan three times over . Are you forgetting I must make other loans and that all my creditors have to be satisfied ? " " You call this loan a small one ? " quavered the old man .

The return must be heavy , and the security good , to make this terrible risk worth while . " " The return , " said Coeur , with a wry smile , " is heavy . Thirty per cent interest ! " The Italian , who looked as though he had been living in a steam bath and had been reduced thereby to the human limits of desiccation , piped yip sharply : " I would demand of the King of France forty per centum for such a loan . You may know by the difference , Jacques Coeur , how well I think of you . " He plucked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nails and veins . " As to Beaucaire , it 's far enough south to he out of the reach of the Engloys . Yes , yes , I must have Beaucaire . " " If the people of Paris knew what you were demanding of me , they would stone you to death in the streets . " The veil which had obscured the rheumy orbs of the ancient banker54 THE MONEYMANsuddenly cleared . Coeur found himself looking into the most predatory pair of eyes he had ever encountered . They were ageless eyes and as much out of place in that shrunken body as a beating heart in a scarecrow . " Have a care to yourself , Jacques Coeur , " shrilled the moneylender . " They are more likely to stone you . The common people do not like rich men . When they hear that Jaquet the Fox is paying the whole cost of the war himself , they will want to know where he got the money for it . They will say that it came out of their pockets . They say now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver shoes . They gaze after him with envy in their hearts . " He paused and nodded his head several times . " You are a generous man and a brave one , Jacques Coeur . You may win them their freedom  --  and be stoned as your sole reward ! " Coeur had never doubted that he stood well with the common people , never doubted that they looked with pride at what he , who had been one of them , had accomplished . " Old age is robbing him of his wits , " he said to himself . " His avarice has addled him . " And yet there was a prophetic ring to the words which nettled him with a first stirring of fear . He got to his feet and began to pace about in an effort to regain his self-confidence . " Guiseppi of Lombardy , " he said finally . " I am not modest . I know myself for a man of infinite resource . If these loans I am now compelled to make should recoil like one of Jean Bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have enough inventiveness here "  --  touching his forehead with his hand  --  " to build a new and better structure on the ruins . I 'm afraid of nothing . I 'm not afraid of the English . I can snap my fingers at all who yap at my heels . " I 've made up my mind about the terms I 'm prepared to accept on this loan , " he went on . " Banker , I wo n't give you Beaucaire as security . I wo n't give you all the others you have demanded . Five you shall have and no more ; and I myself shall have the selection of them . Those are my terms . Aut cape aut relinque . " ' " I must have time , " whined the Lombard . " I ca n't risk my moneys without due thought . My good lord Coeur , I must give the matter the deepest consideration . " " Take a week , " said Coeur . " Go back to the Grand Pont and think it over well . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wait for moneylenders . " " Wars , " declared the old man , recovering some shreds of his arrogance , " ca n't be fought without moneylenders . " ' Take it or leave it . THE MONEYMAN 55 " You 're wrong , banker . This one can be fought without moneylenders . But not without Jacques Coeur . " The banker shuffled from the room , muttering to himself , and Jacques Coeur returned to the papers heaped on his desk . He went through them with the utmost speed , recording his findings with a decisive " Yes " or " No " on the margins and scrawling at the bottom of each his bold " De C2 . " Nicolas returned . " Robert de Poitevin is here , " he said . " Because he 's the King 's physician , should he stamp in here as though he owned us body and soul ? " The Moneyman 's face had taken oii a grave expression . " I 'm afraid he 's the bearer of ill tidings . Well , bring him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard from the other side of the screen . Coeur frowned and demanded , " What 's that ? " " A cat , master . The girl has it in a basket . " " Is she still here ? I thought I told you to send her away . I 've consideredsending you away a thousand times , my gome . This time I may do it . " Nicolas was not disturbed . " You need n't buy any flutes ' from me today , master . You need me and full well you know it . " Coeur raised his hands in a gesture of resignation . " In the name of all the saints ! Bring the physician in ! " 2Robert de Poitevin was a small man who looked the world squarely in the eye and feared nothing . He was not afraid of contracting the diseases and mischiefs he encountered every day and so had never adopted any of the devices his fellow physicians used . He did not wear a tunic steeped in chemicals nor did he fill his ears and nostrils with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead he dressed in a plain gray habit , and the only sign by which he could be identified was a small caduceus embroidered on his collar . He walked in briskly and seated himself beside the Moneyman 's chair without indulging in any form of salutation . " Jacques Coeur , " he said , pointing at him with a forefinger , " Agnes Sorel is going to present the King with another child . " The Moneyman was both shocked and disturbed . " But , my good Robert , she 's in very bad health ! Can she hope to survive childbirth when she 's already in such a weakened condition ? " ' In Paris jargon of the day , pick a quarrel. 56 THE MONEY MANThe physician answered in gloomy tones : " I 'm not pleased , you may be sure . " " Have you told the King ? " Robert de Poitevin nodded . " An hour ago . His King 's Grace was disposed to regard the news with pride at first . When I made it clear to him that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he became very angry with me , as I knew he would . Our liege lord does n't like to face unpleasant facts . He told me that he was n't satisfied with my unsupported opinion . . . . Well , I shall have to call them in , Olivier de Bousse from the University , that great blowhard , that maker of empty phrases , and the rest of them . We 'll have the consultation he demands and they will sit around solemnly for hours , talking in Latin texts and making it abundantly clear that they know nothing at all . And then they will say to our liege lord that his servant , Robert de Poitevin , has been hasty in his opinion , that they in their joint wisdom do not agree with him entirely . They will say that the Lady Agnes is undoubtedly quite ill but that , on the other hand , she is still a young woman and God 's ways are inscrutable and why should any mortal take it on himself to know what is in the heavenly mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my calling ! We pretend to know so much and in reality we know so very little ! Consider the matter of poisons  --  " " Come , my good Robert ! If you get launched on that subject , you 'll talk for hours . Frankly , I ca n't allow you that much time today . My hours arc filled  --  and the news you have brought me will weigh so heavily that I ca n't hope to accomplish much . " The two men stared at each other in an unhappy silence for several moments . Then Coeur said , " Tell me the truth , Master Robert . Is there any hope for her ? " The physician shook his head slowly and sadly . " Jacques Coeur , " he said , " Agnes Sorel is going to die ! " Nicolas watched his master from the other side of the room with a worried frown . It was unusual for Jacques Coeur to remain impassive for such a long time ; the news he had received from the physician had been disturbing , quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this it was better to leave him alone , and so it was with reluctance that the servant crossed the floor again . He said , " Master , he 's here . " The Moneyman roused himself with some difficulty . " Who is here ? " " Would I disturb you again for anything short of a summons from the King ? Or because the Sire d'Arlay has returned at last ? " THE MONEYMAN 57 " Robin has arrived ? " There was a note of relief in the voice of the Moneyman . " I am glad to hear it . Bring him up , Nicolas , bring him up ! " 3That there was a bond of mutual esteem between the two men was apparent when D'Arlay entered . Coeur met him halfway across the room with both arms outstretched . He wrapped them around the newcomer and gave him an affectionate hug . " How , Robin ! " he cried . " I 'm delighted to see you . You 're as brown , my gadling , as though you had returned from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I have much to tell you , " declared D'Arlay , settling himself down in the chair the physician had vacated . For an hour they talked . They discussed the results of the tour D'Arlay had made , his meeting with Coeur factors in the course of his travels ( Coeur knew them all so well that he could have quoted the profits of each for any given year ) , the news from the East which the last ships in at Montpellier had brought , the presents that D'Arlay had picked up , particularly for Isabeau ( Coeur 's scowl was evidence that he did not approvethe bringing of presents for Isabeau ) , and the state of the country generally . They had not exhausted their interest by any means when a trumpet sounded in the street . Coeur sprang eagerly to his feet . " The convoy from the south has arrived , " he said . " You must see this , Robin . There has been a procession through the town so the people could gape at the marvelous things we shall have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Donning his customary houve , a curious type of headpiece which closely resembled in shape an oriental turban , Coeur led the way out to the open gallery which overlooked the inner courtyard on all four sides at a height of about fifteen feet . It was a narrow and picturesque passage with elaborately carved stone pillars . They took up their station beside one of these . The merchant , all eagernessnow , leaned over the stone railing . The trumpet sounded again , a high , shrill note . A company of heralds rode into the courtyard , three abreast . They were astride fine black steeds and wore tabards of crimson with the Coeur device of heart and shell in gold thread and the familiar motto in bold letters , A Vaillants Coeurs Rien Impossible . Men in eastern costume followed , leading camels by their nose cords . The camels , clearly , were for display only ; they carried no burdens save maidens in white who sat high up on the red leather58 THE MONEYMANsaddles , and they swayed and minced along and raised their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the riders sparkled with a lively sense of the part they were playing . " The East , the magic East ! " said Coeur , turning around to nod and smile at his companion . " It 's the home of mystery . You never know what to expect . And it 's the same with the goods which reach me from there . They are always a treasure trove of surprise . Who knows but what we may find in one of the bundles a tiara which once graced the brow of the Queen of Sheba or a lamp from which a dread genie may be re-leased . " A train of jugglers followed , tossing knives of polished steel in the air , and after them a body of musicians who struck up a curious refrain on instruments of the East . " How this takes me back ! " sighed Coeur . " That music gets in your blood . How clearly I remember my first visit to Damascus . They thought ill of Frenchmen then and every night we were herded to prison and locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I soon changed all that . They found they could trust Jacques Coeur , that he was the one to trade with first , instead of the wily merchants from Venice and Genoa . Today , as you know , my ships have the freedom of eastern waters and my captainsget the cream of the trade . " The van of the procession , which was devoted exclusively to entertainment , had now unwound itself and taken station at one end of the courtyard . The musicians continued to play as the pack mules ambled in , loaded with bundles in red , green , and white canvas . " It 's hard for me to wait until the unpacking begins , " said Coeur , shifting his feet as though he also found it hard to stand still . He stopped suddenly , his eyes fixed on the spectators below who had been forced to crowd back against the walls . He reached out one hand and touched D'Arlay on the shoulder . " Robin , do you see that girl ? " " I see a score of girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one near the foot of the east tourelle . See , she has on a long gray cloak and a hood . It 's extraordinary , Robin , quite extraordinary ! " D'Arlay looked in the direction indicated . The crowd , made up for the most part of customers who had been in the shop when the procession arrived , was so thick that he could not identify the girl in question . Certainlyhe saw nothing to account for the excitement which had taken holdof his companion . " She looks like  --  " Coeur broke off and slammed a fist down on the top of the stone railing . " She 's gone ! Come with me , Robin . I must n't let her get away . I must find her at once . " THE MONEYMAN 59D'Arlay followed at his heels , wondering what had come over him . Coeur was so excited that he began to run as soon as they turned in from the gallery . He raced down a short stretch of hall , beckoning D'Arlay to do the same , and then footed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought them to a door with a cresset burning rather fitfullyabove it . " I hope we 're in time ! " he muttered , opening the latch with an eager hand . They found themselves in an unlighted corridor , so narrow that they could touch the wall on each side and so low that they had to bend overas they walked . There were apertures in the walls at regular intervals through which shafts of light appeared . Coeur peered ahead of him and shouted , " Antoine ! " " Yes ? " answered a voice from somewhere in the gloom ahead of them . " Sound the Coquille ! Quick ! The Coquille ! " They heard hurried footsteps and an instant later a bell tolled out . It was so loud and urgent that D'Arlay had no doubt it could be heard in all parts of the vast establishment . " Now all the doors will be closed and guarded , " explained Coeur , with a note of satisfaction in his voice . " No one will be able to leave . I think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all this about ? " demanded D'Arlay impatiently . " Why is it so important not to let this girl get away ? " The Moneyman motioned down the corridor . " This is a way I 've found to prevent the theft of goods exposed for sale . The corridor runs allaround the building and overlooks the sections where the most valuable articles are shown . I keep four men here as long as the shop is open . They watch what goes on below through the slits in the wall . Nothing which happens escapes them . If a customer takes a fancy to something beyond the reach of his purse , or hers , my man sees and pulls one of theropes . The bell sounds , the doors are closed and they are not openedagain until the guilty one has been located . The matter is always resolved to the great discomfort of the thief . " " A most ingenious arrangement . " Coeur led the way back through the door and closed it after them . " There are two ropes for the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airof conscious pride . " The second is to warn of fire . They are in all partsof the building as well , each attached to the one bell . The theft bell is called the Coquille and the other the Incendie . They have different soundsand so there is no mistaking the reason for the signal in each case . I planned this method myself . " 60 THE MONEYMAN " This girl , I judge , is a thief . " Coeur laughed . " No , Robin , the girl is n't a thief . Do you think me soconcerned over the loss of some paltry gewgaw that I would go to all this trouble myself ? It happens that the Coquille is serving me in a matter which may be of the utmost importance . " " Explain it , then , in God 's good name ! " " I prefer to leave the explanation , " said Coeur , leading the way backto his own apartment , " until you can see the girl at close hand . It may be I 've been deceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 4Valerie followed Nicolas into the presence of Coeur and his companion . She was frightened , not knowing the reason for the brusque way she had been singled out , and she kept her eyes lowered . The reed basket was clutched tightly in both hands . When the servant urged her forward , her sense of alarm grew . She plucked nervously at his sleeve . " Monsieur , " she whispered , " what have I done that 's so very wrong ? " " You need n't be afraid , Mademoiselle . The master means you noharm . " He found it necessary , in spite of this reassurance , to take her by theelbow and compel her reluctant steps forward . They halted in front ofthe table . " Is this the one , master ? " asked Nicolas . The Moneyman took a glance at the downcast face of the girl andnodded triumphantly . " Yes , my argus-eyed Nicolas , this is the one , " hesaid . He got to his feet . Placing himself in front of the girl , he studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Remarkable ! " and seizing both her hands , patted them together exuberantly . " I was not mistaken ! " he cried . " It 's even closer than I thought . Remarkable , indeed ! My child , . who are you ? " D'Arlay had been so astonished when Valerie entered the room thathe had brushed a hand across his eyes to make sure he was not being deceived . When he had left after the solemn ceremony of burying Damian Maret , there had been no talk of her coming to Paris . He had heard nodiscussion , in fact , of her plans . In leaving he had entrusted a sum to the Scot which he knew would suffice to cover her needs until such time as she became settled in some new niche in life . He had not expected to seeher again . THE MONEYMAN 61Standing before the Moneyman in her badly tattered cloak , looking frightened and thoroughly bewildered , she had much the same effecton him as she had when , in the light from the campfire , he had placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He had knownthen that he was perilously close to falling in love . Now , he realized , he was walking even closer to the edge ; one blind step would carry him over . " Was it fated that she should come here ? That I should see her again ? " he asked himself . It had required an accident to bring them together . If Jacques Coeur 's eye had not happened to pick her out , shewould have vanished immediately and been swallowed up forever in the great city . " Her name is Valerie Maret , " he said , stepping forward . The girl looked up quickly and a smile of great relief lighted up her face . " I do n't know why I have been brought here , my lord , " she said . " I 've done no wrong . Perhaps you will tell them that I 'm honest and make them let me go . " It was Jacques Coeur 's turn to be astonished . His eyes darted back and forth from one to the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered D'Arlay . " An accident brought us together one eveningnot so long ago in a desolate part of the country . I do n't know whatpurpose you have in summoning her here but I 'm sure she ca n't have lone anything wrong . " Jacques Coeur 's face became grave . He put into words the thought which had flashed through D'Arlay 's mind a few moments before . " Ian see the hand of fate in this . Why else should she have come , andtoday of all days ? There can be no doubt about it . Everything fits into curious pattern , even the refusal of this fellow of mine to obey the orders I gave him . A divine hand guided her to this spot , I swear . " D'Arlay smiled at Valerie as though to say , " I do n't know what he means any more than you do but you must n't let it disturb you . " " My child , what have you in that basket ? " asked the Moneyman . " A cat , my lord . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried Coeur . " By St. Martin of Tours , I know it was not mere accident which brought her to my attention . Even the cat did its best to waken me . How unreceptive I was ! I wasdetermined not to see her . . . . Most fortunately it had been willed other-wise . " " Perhaps , " said D'Arlay , " you will now condescend to tell us what you mean . " 62 THE MONEYMAN " Look at her ! " exclaimed Coeur . " Surely you can see what I see . " " I 've been aware from the first that Mademoiselle Maret resembles someone I have seen but so far I have n't been able to tell who it is . " " Think , Robin ! " Coeur planted himself in front of his friend and stared into his eyes as though striving in that way to set his mind in the right direction . " Think back . Back many years . Back to the first time we met , you and I. You will recall the occasion well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back his head and laughed triumphantly . " Of course ! " he cried . " I see it now . How could I have been so very dense ? " Then his mood sobered . " It 's hard to believe and yet the resemblance is quite unmistakable . " Chapter VID'ARLAY 'S THOUGHTS had gone back to the saddest day in his life . He was seventeen years old and Isabeau was marrying his brother . He walked in the procession , dressed most handsomely in ceremonious white , even to his shoes , which curled to a point in front like whitecaps on a rolling tide . Ilk heart was heavy as he paced up the aisle and he kept saying to himself with an almost frantic insistence : " This is all a terrible dream . It ca n't be true ! She was to marry me , not Regnault . Something will happen to put a stop to this , because it 's wrong and unthinkable that she should wed anyone but me ! " He hoped that a specter from his brother 's unsavory past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cathedral to call a halt . He more than half believed that the allseeingand wise God would send down a thunderbolt to prevent such an unseemly plighting of vows . But nothing of the kind happened . In an unhappy daze he heard the solemn words of the bishop , the rise and fall of the choir chants . " If a stop is to be put to it , " he thought , " I must do it myself ! " He was standing , with no knowledge of having risen to his feet . There was a rustle of sound about him , faces staring up at him , amused and unfriendly faces , elbows nudging , whispers of surprise . He opened his mouth to say that the ceremony must not go on but no sound issued forth . A parched sensation in his throat made it impossible for him toTHE MONEYMAN 63speak , despite the torrent of protest which filled him . After a moment he brushed a hand across his forehead and it came away damp withperspiration . He crushed his way out to the aisle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself and unable , as a result , to sustain the amused scrutiny of all those peering faces . He began to walk down the aisle , arms held stiffly at his sides , his eyes fixed straight ahead . " I 'm a fool ! " he said to himself . " A stupid , blundering fool ! Everyone is laughing at me . Isabeau will hear about it and then she will laugh at me too . " Sometime later he found himself in the cathedral entrance . The ceremony was over . The sun was high , the sky a joyous blue , the talk of the people who crowded the steps loud and animated . This was all wrong , he knew . How could they chatter and laugh as though nothing had happened ? For that matter , how could the sun think it worth while to shine so brightly in the face of this catastrophe ? A hand fell on his shoulder and he looked up into a friendly face under a most curious kind of hat . He roused himself sufficiently from his state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everything that was unconventional . The newcomer 's eyes proclaimed his moods openly instead of peering stealthily from behind an evasive curtain . He had a manner free of the stilted niceties of the court ; a laugh which had the courage to be a real laugh , a jauntiness in the matter of dress which also required courage in this day of rigid adherence to set fashions . " Is it possible , " asked the stranger , regarding him with frank curiosity , " that you are the young brother of the bridegroom ? I 've nothing to say against my good gossip Regnault , who amuses me in spite of everything ; but truly , my boy , the difference between you is remarkable enough to make one doubt the relationship . " " I am Robinet de Burey . " " I 'm told you are of a bookish turn , " went on the stranger . " That is surprising , and admirable , in itself ; for the minds of all aspirants to knightly honors of your age do not seem to me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The keen eyes under the strange hat studied him closely . " You look pale , my boy . Are you not feeling well ? " " I 'm quite well , Monsieur . " " My name , " said the man , " is Jacques Coeur . You have heard of me , no doubt . " Everyone had heard of the King 's fabulous Moneyman , the furrier64 THE MONEYMANof Bourges who had risen to such wealth and power . Despite the lacerated state of his feelings , young D'Arlay looked at his companion with a certain amount of interest , liking him at once and sensing in him a genuine warmth and friendliness . " I 'm of an interfering turn , " said the Moneyman , " and you may resent what I 'm going to say to you , Robinet de Burey . It happens that I have acquaintances in Anjou who have told me about  --  well , about you and your brother and the fair lady who has just pledged her vows to him and thereby acquired what she wanted most , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me as though I had committed sacrilege and wounded you mortally in so doing . I 've been guilty of no more than putting into words what you know inside yourself to be the full truth , my boy . My desire to help you is my excuse for this frankness of speech . " He threw an arm around D'Arlay 's shoulders and began to lead him down the steps . " It seems like the blackest of tragedies at this moment . Life has become a dreary affair , the future as dark as the plume in the hat of the brave Bastard of Orleans . But time is a great thing , my boy . It can cure almost any ill in its slow but very sure way . I can look back to a tragedy in my own life which was not entirely unlike yours ; and there is now even a certain sweetness in my memory of it . " Not knowing how to answer this unexpected and uninvited confidence , D'Arlay said nothing . After a moment the Moneyman went on . " There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared , with a broad smile . " We are complete strangers and yet I 'm going to be bold enough to propose a cure . You must go away . You must allow yourself time to become accustomed to what has happened . " D'Arlay found himself in instant agreement . This was the solution ! He must get away , far away , where he could see nothing of Isabeau and Regnault and the friends they had in common . He was sure he could no longer maintain the pretense of indifference which he had assumed the instant Isabeau told him of her decision . This , clearly , was the course he must follow : to go away and , if necessary , to stay away forever . " I think you 're right , Monsieur Coeur , " he said . " I 'm a busybody  --  but I 'm many other things , " declared Jacques Coeur . " I am , for instance , a shipowner . Perhaps you know I have some ships engaged in the eastern trade . Tomorrow my stout Jean de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my finest vessel from Montpellier on the run to Alexandria . Would you care to go with him ? Egypt is a land of wonder . The whisper of dead centuries reaches your ears the instantTHE MONEYMAN 65you sight the roadstead . And you will have a chance to go on to the 1loly Land and even up to Damascus . " l ) ' Arlay made up his mind on the instant . He had always wanted to go to sea ; the East had worked on his imagination like a magnet . He would take this chance so generously and gratuitously offered him , and if he never saw Isabeau again , it would be all for the best . " You are so kind I can find no words to thank you , " he said to the Moneyman . " I accept your offer , Monsieur Coeur ! I accept it gladly . " " I thought you would . I was so sure of it that I risked a rebuff in coining to you like this . You 'll soon get over this present mood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The keen winds of the Inner Sea will sweep all the cobwebs of regret from your mind , my boy . Well , come to see me tonight . I 'll have Jean de Village there to greet you. , He 's a famously fine fellow , this jean of mine , and you will become the best of friends in less time than it takes me to sell a bolt of camelot cloth to a buxom house-wife . " They had reached the street . D'Arlay glanced at his companion and suddenly found himself determined to assert a new manliness of sentimentover what had happened . " I hate my brother ! " he said . " And as for his wife , I shall never see her again as long as I live . " The Moneyman halted beside a carriage in the street with four mettlesomewhite horses . A lady sat inside and , as they stopped , she leaned out and smiled at Jacques Coeur . She was so beautiful that D'Arlay looked at her with an almost incredulous wonder . This being his first visit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the court and he found himself considering who she could be . That point was resolved at once by the Moneyman . " Lady Agnes , " he said , moving closer to the carriage and bowing low , " I 'm happy to see that you 've recovered so soon from your indisposition . May I present a new friend of mine ? This is Robinet de Burey , Sire cl'Arlay . My boy , this is the Lady Agnes Sorel who is , I am sure you already agree , the most lovely lady in all the world . " So this was Agnes Sorel , the mistress of the King ! D'Arlay had heard the stories about her which circulated over France and even reached the secluded corner of Anjou where he had lived all his life , stories of her great qualities of heart as well as of her unusual beauty . Reports of royal mistresses were generally edged with malice and dislike but Agnes Sorel was so kindly regarded that many people were disposed to put some stock in the suggestion that she was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their relationship had been kept on a platonic plane . Even those who pointed to the existence of her three pretty young daughters and balked at the sacrilege in assuming that immaculate conceptions could have occurred in a royal court , were still willing to concede that her influence over the monarch was a beneficent one . The boy bowed to her , finding himself somewhat discomfited by the frankness of interest with which she was regarding him . The reports he had heard of her had not been exaggerated in the slightest degree . She had a beauty which excited as well as pleased the senses . His attention went first to her eyes , which were a light blue , a most unusual blue , and then to her mouth . It was so vividly red that it suggested passion and yet , on closer inspection , he could see that it was gentle and highly sensitive . " I 've heard of the Sire d'Arlay , " said Agnes Sorel , in a pleasantly lowpitchedvoice . " He has made up his mind to sail East on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his companion an encouraging thump on the back . " We are men of quick decision , this young friend of mine and I ; we thought of the plan no more than a minute ago and it was settled between us quicker than you could lirp a finger . He leaves tomorrow with Jean de Village and will sail at once from Montpellier . " Agnes Sorel smiled and nodded her head . " What an excellent idea , " she said . " I 'm sure , Sire d'Arlay , you 'll find your journey most stimulating . It will be "  --  she looked at him with so much sympathy and understandingthat he knew she had heard his story also  --  " it will be a great adventure for you . And the very best thing  --  under the circumstances . " " He will come back loaded with wealth , " declared Coeur . " With preciousstones and wonderful fabrics and spices and perfumes . Perhaps he will bring back also  --  who can tell ?  --  a beautiful eastern princess as his bride . " D'Arlay had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be wondered at that the resemblance borne her by this little waif had eluded him for so long. 2 " And now you know , " said Jacques Coeur . " And now I know . " The Moneyman , whose eyes were sparkling with excitement , took her hand again and gave it a reassuring pat . " My child , " he said , " you mustTHE MONEYMAN 67forgive us . We are talking in riddles . You must be patient until  --  until t c morrow , perhaps . " " Yes , my lord . " It was clear from her tone that she was more puzzled than ever . " One of two things will happen , " went on the Moneyman . " I may say to you that a certain dream in which I had indulged myself has dissolved and that I wo n't have any use for you after all . If it turns out that way , there will be a little present for you to compensate for the strange way in which we 've used you . On the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . In the meantime . . . " Coeur frowned as he pondered the question of what was to be done with her immediately . Then he gave a satisfied nod . " My factor lives with his family at the top of this building . There will be a room for you there , and a bed , and plenty of food . Later , I hope , it will be necessary to make permanent arrangements . " He called to his servant , " Nicolas , I 'm entrusting MademoiselleMaret to you . " Valerie , now thoroughly bewildered , turned her eyes in D'Arlay 's direction . Reading the question in them , he said , " I 'm almost as much i n the dark as you are , but I assure you , Mademoiselle , that you need have no fears . " " This way , Mademoiselle , " said Nicolas importantly . When they were alone , Coeur began to address D'Arlay in excited tones . " What a remarkable thing ! The Lady Agnes is the acknowledged Queen of Beauty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And yet here is a girl with no advantages , who comes of peasant stock , if one may judge from the clothes she wears " " Her father was a strolling player named Damian Maret . " Coeur nodded his head with satisfaction . " That explains her voice . It puzzled me , for it shows definite traces of culture . Well , here is the daughter of a cheap cullion who 's sufficiently like the Fair Agnes to be a full blood sister  --  or a daughter . It 's hard to believe but we 've seen the evidencewith our own eyes . " " I saw the Lady Agnes once only and so I 'm not the best judge . But it does seem to me that the resemblance is quite astonishing . " Coeur sat down in his chair and swung one parti-colored knee over the other . He began to enumerate the points of resemblance . " They are identical in coloring , " he said . " There 's the same blue of eye and the same yellow of hair . The girl even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you with a slow raising of the lids just as the Lady Agnes does . She has the same way of lifting a hand to gesture . " He swung68 THE MONEY MANaround in his chair to face his companion . " And now , my gossip Robin , what can you tell me about her ? Under what circumstances did you meet this extraordinary child ? " D'Arlay did not answer at once . He had no way of knowing why Coeur was taking such an interest in Valerie . He felt himself on the defensive . He was still amazed also at the unexpected depth of the feeling he had experienced when he saw her escorted into the room . He had realizedthen , from the exultant jump his heart had given , that he had been wanting to see her again , that he had been regretting his unceremonious leavetaking . Reluctantly he began to tell of his meeting with her . He intended to make the recital a brief one but Jacques Coeur would not permit that . The Moneyman asked innumerable questions and was not satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you believe these people were her real parents ? " asked Coeur at the finish . D'Arlay hesitated . " No , " he said finally . He pondered the question of how much more he should tell , his fingers busy with the pleated drapery of the roundlet he had removed from his head on entering . Finally he decided to repeat the whole story . Jacques Coeur 's face lighted up as he listened , and at the finish he noddedhis head with the most intense satisfaction . " Of course ! " he cried . " There 's the best of blood in her . She 's no child of the people , this small one , no get of a strolling player . The mark of quality is stamped all over her ! " He paused for several moments and then burst out with , " How very fortunate this is ! " " Fortunate ? Why do you say that ? I do n't understand why you are taking so much interest in her , Jacques . " The mood of the Moneyman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must tell you , " he declared . " The King 's physician came to see me no more than an hour ago . He told me that Agnes Sorel has a short time only to live . " " I 'm sorry to hear such news . " After a long silence Coeur began to speak in a low tone . " It will be a great tragedy . Usually I take the optimistic view of things . I always expect that matters will come out right . But in this I find myself fearing the worst . I 'm sure the outcome will be a sad one for  --  for her friends . And for France , D'Arlay , for France above all else . " " I still do n't understand you . " " This is a strange King we have . I do n't need to tell you that . WeTHE MONEYMAN 69both know he has certain fine qualities and I confess to a deep affection for him . But "  --  Coeur shook his head solemnly  --  " his unguided choice of advisers has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right words in the royal ear , things will go wrong . " I 've no illusions about my own position , " he went on . " I 've slept in the royal bed and , for the moment , the King seems to have every confi- ( knce in me . But , Robin , my tenure in reality hangs on a single thread  --  a frail one and of the finest gold . If it breaks " He paused . " I have more enemies than you know . The court is packed with them , whispering , running to the King with every malicious bit of gossip they can pick up or invent . The King lacks constancy . He did not bestir himself to save the Maid . Would he do more for me ? " After another minute of silent thought the Moneyman began to speak in a brisker tone . " The King will mourn Agnes deeply but he will soon take another mistress . Her vixen of a cousin is angling already for the succession . If that happened  --  Robin , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate to offer ? " D'Arlay was so startled that he made no effort to reply . " Have you noticed that the preferences of most men run to certain types ? More often than not a second wife is much like the first one . No man has ever been more deeply enamored of a woman than the King of Agnes Sorel . She has suited him completely . " He paused for a moment . " The most likely candidate would be one who resembled Agnes closely . Now you will understand , my good Robin , why I took an interestin this girl as soon as I set eyes on her . " D'Arlay sprang to his feet . " This is unheard of ! " he cried . " It 's absurd ! You ca n't be serious about it ! " " I 'm completely serious about it . Before I make any move , of course , I must convince myself that the child has character and courage as well as the physical likeness . " If D'Arlay needed any further proof of how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't yet believe , " he said , " that you are in earnest . It 's an idea of the moment . You 'll brush it aside after giving it more thought . " Coeur looked up in surprise at the feeling he had detected in D'Arlay 's voice . " Is it possible that you take a personal interest in her ? " D'Arlay indulged in serious thought before answering . " I like her . Perhaps it was because of the circumstances under which I met her but certainly I feel protective toward her . " Coeur spread out his hands in a questioning gesture . " Why are you so emphatic about it ? " 70 THE MONEYMAN " Surely there are better ways of meeting the situation  --  if it ever arises . Is the favor of the King worth saving at such a price ? " Coeur laid a hand on the other 's arm . " It 's not favor for myself which concerns me . You are honorable and patriotic , Robin . Will you acknowledgeme to be the same ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I know you to be the most honorable of men . " An even greater gravity manifested itself on the face of the Moneyman . " It 's regrettable that sometimes you must do things as a minister of the state which you would n't do as a man . When a certain step , which may be harmful for individuals , is best for the state of the nation , there can be no holding back . I have to do many things , Robin , which gall me bitterly . I do n't need to tell you that there can be no recovery or prosperityfor France , no happiness for her people , until the invaders are driven out . The King must be held in line ! It 's not only necessary to finishthe war but to provide our sick and bleeding country with strong leadership through the first years of peace . Can we allow personal feelings to sway us in this all-important matter ? " " That much I grant you  --  " " Listen to me ! When Agnes Sorel dies , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  unless his fancy is directed elsewhere . The succession so far is in her hands  --  her selfish , grasping , cruel hands . She 's committed to the other party , to men who will use her influence with the King to get power and wealth for themselves . " He remained silent for several moments and then burst out with , " That must not happen ! " D'Arlay did not answer . His mind was occupied with the reflections natural to one who , realizing himself in love , is faced with a danger to the object of his devotion . The Moneyman went on by asking him a question . " You see dishonor in the course I propose ? " " I shrink from the thought of it , Jacques ! " " Have you been blaming Agnes Sorel all these years ? " D'Arlay shook his head with some reluctance . " I must acknowledge that I 've always had the deepest respect for her . " " Then it 's clear that you are not being consistent . I 'm prepared to strive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to stand aside in scrupulous delicacy and see my country suffer . In matters of state the result justifies the means . I firmly believe it was fate broughtTHE MONEYMAN 71this girl here . Why otherwise should a seemingly perfect instrument be delivered into my hands at this moment ? " " But the girl herself  --  " " The girl may not have the capacity or the will for the part . That is still to be determined . And , of course , there 's always the probability that she 'll refuse to try . " " When anyone has lived the kind of life she has , " declared D'Arlay , after a moment of uneasy reflection , " they ca n't be blamed if they accept such a chance . " Coeur regarded him steadily for the moment . " The aristocrat in you prompted that , " he said . Then he asked a question , " Could France have been united under Charles if there had been no Jeanne d'Arc ? " D'Arlay frowned in a puzzled way . " Certainly . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And is that view generally held in court circles and among the nobility ? " " Yes . You know it is . " Coeur leaned forward and began to speak in a tone of the greatest earnestness . " It 's different with the people of France . They hold the Maid in the deepest reverence . They speak her name in whispers . She is the saviour of the country , a heroine , a saint , the one figure in history above reproach or blame . Someday all of France will come to see her in that light . Even the nobility , unlikely though that may seem now . Someday , perhaps , the whole world . " " We seem to be talking at cross-purposes . " " I 've been leading up to this : if the girl accepts the proposal I may make her , . it will be because of the inspiration of the Maid , because she also wants to serve her country . She wo n't see it as a chance to improve her lot . " " I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary , I  --  I have a fondnessfor her . But I still believe the idea an impossible one . How could you hope to fit her for the part ? And , if you succeeded , would the King stoop so low ? " " The King 's infatuation for the original is so great that I 'm sure he would be happy with a copy . We must n't overlook the possibility that she has good blood , derived perhaps from the Sorels . Failing that , I can provide a pedigree for her while she 's being made over . A pleasant little fiction can be arranged to cover the point . " " Are you prepared to go to such lengths as that ? Kings do n't enjoy being duped . " THE MONEYMAN 73Coeur laughed easily . " I 've no intention of telling him anything . Beyondmy promise to obtain a command for him with the guns , he 'll have to be content with a few friendly words and perhaps a small purse of gold . " This assurance did not entirely allay D'Arlay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own band of Free Companions ? " ' " I 'm not surprised . " D'Arlay frowned uneasily . " He seems to be acting as her guardian and I 'm not sure you can satisfy him as easily as that . Much as I shrink from what you have in mind , I do n't want to see any trouble come of it . It might be wise if I took him along with me . I have plenty of room and Helion has a leg of lamb on the fire and a roast train ' big enough for three . I suggest this because it will be necessary to keep an eye on the fellow . " " An excellent idea . I 'll talk to him for a few minutes and then turn him over to you . " The Moneyman looked up at a huge clock on the wall over his head . It was marked off into the twenty-four hours and the hand was hovering over the fifteenth . " I should have been at the Louvre long before this . A full day 's work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris with the eyes of his king . He loved the city . He loved it so much that he forgot the things weighing on his mind as he and the Scot made their way toward his house in the Rue Grenier sur L'Eau . He nodded his head at the tangle of spires against the skyline . " It 's unfortunate , " he said , " that there has never been a poet capable of interpreting the spirit of Paris . " " I 'm not a poet but I can do that for you . And in a very few words . The spirit of Paris is made up of bombast and insolence . Not to mention thievery . " " That comes in poor grace from the mouth of an alien , " said D'Arlay angrily . " I have fought and bled for France and yet in this city dirty little'A batter of flour and wine flavored with ginger and sugar and baked about the meats. 72 THE MONEYMAN " If the King found her to his liking , he would be eager himself to supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at obstacles we may never meet ? I promise you one thing : any scheme I commit myself to will be so carefully prepared that it will stand the most hostile scrutiny . " D'Arlay tossed both arms in the air with a gesture of resignation . " What more can I say ? Will it avail anything to point out that changing her into a lady will be a task possible only to someone who knows the ways of the court ? Can you find such a person ? Do you dare let another into such a dangerous secret ? " " As to that , I have a plan in my mind already . " D'Arlay said nothing more . After a few moments of silence the Moneymanleaned over and placed a hand on his companion 's shoulder . His manner and the tone of his voice when he spoke seemed to beg for understanding . " Do you think I 'm happy about this ? My good gossip Robin , you must know this Jacques Coeur well enough to realize that he has no more liking for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitute for the Lady Agnes  --  Robin , it 's like a sword thrust in my heart . I still nurse a slender hope that the physician 's report will prove wrong . But until such time as we know for certain , we must prepare for the worst . We must be ready to play for a big stake , the biggest stake of all  --  the saving of France ! " A still longer silence ensued . D'Arlay could not say , " I love her and so you must give up this scheme . " He could not say it for a number of reasons . Time might prove that his interest in her had been temporary ; but even if it were certain that his devotion would never lessen , he still could not say it . Only matrimonial intentions would give him the right to interfere further , and marriage was out of the question . Both men were relieved when Nicolas came in with candles . As he placed one on the table beside his master , he asked in a grumbling tone , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Coeur looked across the low oak screen . The anteroom was empty . " He seems to have lost patience and gone . " " He has lost patience , master , but he has n't gone . He was n't able to find his way back here . I heard he was making a disturbance in the Spicer-le but by the time I got there he had wandered on to the Horsegear . I found him at last in Mortars , Pestles , and Pots . He demands two things , master : to see you at once and to know what has happened to the girl . " " I 'll talk to him now . " When the servant had left , D'Arlay said in an urgent tone , " I strongly advise that the Scot be kept in ignorance of this rash plan . " 74 THE MONEYMANurchins shout Tug-mutton ! ' after me . When I stop at an inn , I am underfedand overcharged . Women take one look at the tartan around my neck and turn away . " " Paris , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so fine a city that even the smell of its streets , which is most peculiarly rank and penetrating , is like incense in my nostrils . The spirit of Paris is made up of wisdom , sparkle , irreverence , abandon , fortitude , and rebellion . " Kennedy was not to be put down . " All kindliness has gizzened out of Paris like water from a cask in the sun . " They came shortly thereafter to a spot in the town where an inn , toweringhigh above its sign which bore the name La Galimafree , faced on the dilapidated sheds of a market . The space between was filled with men staring up at a balcony on the front of the tavern , which , at the moment , was empty . There was a great deal of loud talk going on . " It 's said , " one of the watchers was remarking as they drew abreast , " that he took his battle-ax and sliced the flesh from the ribs of Don Guzman as evenly as a butcher cutting chops . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burgundian . " That brought a quick answer . " And ca n't we , as Frenchmen , be proud of a Burgundian ? " Drawing on the resources of his own tongue , Kennedy demanded to know what all this cur ! u fele was about . " I think , " answered D'Arlay , " it has to do with the great Jacques de Lalain . " There was a stir at this moment , occasioned by the opening of the door at the back of the balcony . A tall knight sauntered out and waved a carelesshand to the crowd assembled below . " There he is , the greatest champion in the world , " said D'Arlay . " I met him once and it was like talking to a battle-ax equipped with a small brain and a huge pride . He spends all his time traveling about and seekingnew opponents to kill or maim . " He turned to his companion . " Jacques Coeur said a very true thing once , that all knights-errant are like cruel small boys who have never grown up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both tall enough and broad enough to make the squire , who had followed him out on the balcony , seem small by comparison . He was dressed in white from head to foot , with enormous tufted sleeves and an ermine cloak tossed over one shoulder with an affectation of carelessness . A nose like the beak of a parrot arched out from between eyes of an opaque blue . His hair was dark and straight , falling full-bottomed to his shoulders . THE MONEYMAN 75He advanced to the railing and looked about him with a smile of amused pride . " Ha , scum of Paris ! " he called . " You 've come to see Jacques de Lalain . Well , look at me closely . You will never see me again . You will never see me in the lists , canaille of Paris . Your brave knights have prudently abstained from taking up the cartel of defiance I sent on in advance . " He stared about him with mounting arrogance . " I am the greatest fighter in all Christendom ! I can defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ! Take one last look at me , starved and sniveling worm bait , for I shall never come back . " D'Arlay swore bitterly under his breath when the great champion withdrewout of sight . The crowd was already scattering , well pleased , apparently , at the insulting reference to the chivalry of France . He motioned the Scot to follow him and was vigorously plowing his way to the side of the street when he heard his name called from the door of the inn . He stopped and looked back . " The Sire d'Arlay ! The Sire d'Arlay ! " " Who wants me ? " The squire responsible for the summons came out through the crowd . " My master , " he said , " is sitting down to supper and begs the honor of your company . " D'Arlay asked in a tone of surprise , " Did your master see me from up there ? " " An eagle , " said the squire with an intolerable air of pride , " can spot its prey in the air at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise when Jacques de Lalain recognizes the Sire d'Arlay at a mere twenty yards ? " " Convey my respects to your master and say that the Sire d'Arlay regrets his inability to accept . I have a friend who accompanies me to my own house for supper . " " My master said the bidding included the Scot if needs be . " Kennedy grinned . " He can pick out a tartan at twenty yards also , it seems . " The two recipients of the invitation looked questioningly at each other . D'Arlay whispered , " It might be interesting to watch the ravening boar of Burgundy at his feeding . " " Aye , " said the Scot . " I would n't be above making my boasts that I had broken bread into the gravy with Jacques de Lalain . " D'Arlay turned to the squire . " Our thanks , then , to your master and say we 'll join him as soon as we have washed and set our clothing in76 THE MONEYMAN THE MONEYMAN 77order . Warn him that by comparison with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crows . " The squire belched indifferently . " They always do , my lord . " 2Jacques de Lalain received them in a room back of the balcony in which a table had already been spread for supper . He had dismissed his followerswith the exception of one servant and was sprawled out in a chair , his massive white-clad legs spread wide for comfort . He got slowly and reluctantly to his feet . " Robinet de Burey , Sire d'Arlay , " he said with a stiff bow . " I 'm happy to see you again . And this is the Scot ? His name does not matter . This is most fortunate , as now I need n't sup in solitude . " " It 's fortunate indeed , my Lord de Lalain , " said D'Arlay , bowing in turn . He scrutinized his host 's face closely , saying to himself , " There is something noble about him and yet his is the cruelest face I 've ever seen . " The supper which the servant proceeded to serve had been chosen with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best of all fish , served with a white sauce in which the appetizing tang of porret predominated . This was followed by an unlaced mallard , and then the main dish appeared , a roast kid with flutings of ribbon around the tail . At the finish there arrived a rich hastelet of figs , raisins , and dates , cooked together and served with a gilding of egg yolks . D'Arlay watched this procession of noble dishes with inward pride . " I would like to tell him , " he thought , " that only in Paris , and certainly never in his native Burgundy , could a meal like this be served . " Their host monopolized the conversation , speaking in a voice which seemed surprisingly thin to issue from a frame of such huge proportions . He confined himself to his own exploits , the antagonists he had worsted in single combat , the plans he had for future jousts . Once only did he deviate from this saga of self-glorification . Pausing to look his guest over , he remarked on the lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the French court when De Lalain had last visited there . " The Comte is a mally old gossip , " he said . " He made me laugh at some of his jibes  --  an indulgence I seldom allow myself . His lovely Lady Isabeau "  --  the opaque eyes turned back questingly to D'Arlay  --  " reminded me of a fair creature  --  Spanish , as it happens  --  whose favor I carried on my lance when I fought Don Guzman in Castile a few months agone . But before I beguile your ears with the details of that pleasant little affair , I must pray tribute to the fair Comtesse . I consider her far more lovely actually than my little Spanish spark . She approaches the years when the flower of beauty begins to crisp on the stem but . . . Well , Sire d'Arlay , I confess to a liking for the tang of maturity . " " My fair sister-in-law , " said D'Arlay , speaking in a carefully casual tone , " is most charming . " " Your good opinion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married , Sire d'Arlay ? " " No . I have no wife . " " Nor I. " The Burgundian indulged in one of his admittedly rare laughs . " But for a different reason , I think . " D'Arlay felt a wave of resentment rising in him . He said to himself , " There 's insolence in every word he utters . " His distaste grew as he observed the exaggerated manners of his host : the ceremonious elevation of the goblet to a level with his closed eyes whenever he took a sip of wine as though drinking a silent pledge ; the fastidious manipulation of spoon and knife ; the regal gesture for silence before he began to speak . " As I said out there , there are no champions in France who dare meet me , " proclaimed De Lalain , going back to the topic which interested him most . " Now I must go to Scotland , to England , perhaps even to Italy , to find opponents worthy of me . " " The knights of France , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the King . " Jacques de Lalain snorted . " A brave lot of toy knights to hide behind a royal proclamation . " D'Arlay found his dislike growing every moment . When he spoke , however , it was in a casual tone . " The King is striving to prevent dueling as he will need every loyal subject with him when he renews the war . " He replaced his wine goblet and looked at his host . " Why not fight with the knights of France instead of against them ? You are a Burgundian , of course , and your duke may not share in the campaign . But the English are hard and shrewd fighters and we 'll need all the strength we can muster . If Jacques de Lalain rode under the lilies of France , it would stimulate our men to greater exertion .

" 78 THE MONEYMAN " Your feeling in the matter is of no importance . But if you want the reason , I 'll strive to make you understand . " " I , " said D'Arlay , " shall strive to follow your reasoning . " The knight-errant drew his ermine cloak around both his shoulders , The fire on the hearth was dying down and a chill had settled on the room . He motioned the servant to leave . " I disapprove of the use of cannon , " said De Lalain . " It 's said you plan to make much use of these fire-spitting tubes called bombards . It 's a sorry thing that war will no longer be an honorable meeting between brave knights with Almighty God as the arbiter . " He turned his pale and expressionless eyes on his guest . " I ca n't fight for a country which resorts to black magic . " " The bombards , " said D'Arlay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the English longbow . " The Burgundian brushed this aside . " I may tell you that my sympathies are with France . The English have been overlong on this side of the Channel and the time is ripe to drive them back to their own barbarous island . But I swear to you , " he cried with sudden vehemence , " I would rather see you lose every battle than win by any means save by the might of the chivalry of France ! " D'Arlay stirred impatiently in his chair . " We ca n't drive the English from Normandy by losing battles , " he said . " You are of noble blood , Sire d'Arlay , and it should not be necessary for me to explain what I mean . The result of a battle is not the important thing . All that counts is the way it is fought . I hold firmly to the belief , as all good knights should , that God awards the victory to the side which strives most bravely and in accordance with the Code of Chivalry .

" " 1 'm a bombardier of some note , " declared Kennedy , speaking for the first time since the supper had started , " and I tell you now , Sir Knight , that the guns will clear a way to the Channel with the greatest ease . " Jacques de Lalain did not deign to look at the Scot . " You 're not a knight and my invitation to join us did not include the privilege of taking part in our talk . " He turned to D'Arlay with a shrug of his paddedshoulders . " I 've no intention of disputing with you the principles of honorable warfare . " He frowned and twirled his goblet as though reluctant to proceed with what he had to say . " I had a purpose in asking you to sup with me tonight . Your brother told me you were associated in THE MONEYMAN 79some obscure manner with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've heard also that your Jacques Coeur is the one who is urging the use of bombards . I must ask you to do something for me , to go to the Fox with a message . " He shoved his goblet aside with a movement which indicated distaste for this necessity . " I have a cousin , Alain de Kersai . He has taken the vows of knighthood and is a goodly enough lad , though not capable physically of winning much glory for himself . I had intended making a place for him in the company I 'll take with me to Scotland or on such other travels as I may decide upon . " He paused and regarded D'Arlay with a frown which carried a suggestion of incredulity . " You 'll find what I must now tell you hard to believe . Alain has refused ! The little fool is set on serving with the bombards . I have talked to him , I have reasoned with him , I have even made threats . He remains obdurate . I 'm asking you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not allow Alain to join . He must help me in saving the boy from this great disgrace . " " It 's no disgrace , " said D'Arlay . He was keeping his eyes fixed on the table in front of him . " If we win the war , it will be by the use of the cannon you affect to despise . Your cousin could find no better way to serve . " " I 've tried to consider Alain 's youth and not judge him too harshly . His place is with me . Serving cannon is fit only for common men , blacksmiths and such . " " I 'm thinking of serving under Jean Bureau myself , " said D'Arlay . The Burgundian settled back in his chair with a laugh . " I see now I made a mistake in thinking you might act as my advocate . My first impressionof you was unfavorable , Sire d'Arlay . I should have realized that one who associates with the Fox would have no spark of knightly honor in him . Well , I must go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the King himself . I shall demand that the boy be sent home . " The face of the Burgundian suddenly became white with passion . " I 've an affection for Alain , but I tell you , Sire d'Arlay , I would rather see him dead , and by my own hand if need be , than consorting with common men and  --  and noblemenwho forget the obligations of their class . " " You would get no satisfaction from the King . " " I am sure , " declared the Burgundian , " that the King of France would think twice before refusing a reasonable request from me . I am Jacques de Lalain , the greatest champion in all Christendom . My wishes are not to be disregarded . " It was no longer possible for D'Arlay to contain himself . " You are Jacques de Lalain , the greatest champion in Christendom ! " he cried. 80 THE MONEYMAN " True . But you are also a fool , a blind and stupid fool ! It 's the duty of all patriotic men to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folly as you are preaching ! " Jacques de Lalain shoved back his chair and rose slowly to his feet . He rested his powerful hands on the edge of the table and stared down at his companion with the eagerness of a tomcat when an unwary mouse venturesout within reach of his claws . " Rohinet de Burcy , Sire d'Arlay ! " he said . " You have insulted me , grossly and wantonly . You 're no fit opponent for me but the words you have spoken can be answered in one way only . I demand satisfaction . " " Satisfaction shall be yours . " The Burgundian looked at him in a kind of wonder , as though he had expected some effort to seek an escape by qualification of what had been said . D'Arlay had risen in his turn . Now that his first wave of anger had passed , he realized he had placed his life in jeopardy . " What chance will you have against this butcher ? " he said to himself . " He will cut you to pieces with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with men whose family lines show nobility for at least four generations on each side , " said the Burgundian , willing perhaps to find a flaw in the D'Arlay genealogy . " The De Burcy family goes back more generations than most noble knights can count , " answered D'Arlay . " My mother , as you may know , was Amalie de Madly . Can you match that ? " The two men stared at each other for several moments in silence . Then an enraged flush took possession of the Burgundian 's face and he gripped the handle of his sword . His anger was so great , in fact , that his enormous sleeves gave the impression of being puffed out by it . " I was willing to give you a chance to withdraw , " he said , with a snort . " You 've disregarded it and now the issue between us can only be settled on the field of honor . " " I suggest we take our seats again , " said D'Arlay , suddenly conscious of the fact that his legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangementsiii comfort . Now , I propose that first of all we explore the provisionsof the ( ; ode of Chivalry bearing on this situation . " " ' The provisions , " declared De Lalain , seating himself and raising his wineglass to take a long draught , " are explicit and to the point . " " They 're not as simple as you seem to believe . As it happens , I know the Code as well as you do . Permit me to point out that the intent of the Code is to provide as much equality as possible where opponents are of unequal prowess . You , the greatest knight in Christendom , will concede that anTHE MONEYMAN 81inequality exists between us . That consideration will enter into the choice of weapons . " " The offended party has the choice of weapons . I am the offended party . " " On the contrary , it was you who provoked the quarrel between us . " The Burgundian raised an impatient hand . " Spare me your arguments . I 'm not a lawyer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crafty words . You insulted me to my face as this fellow will attest . The choice rests with me . " D'Arlay realized that his life depended on the resolving of this point . The giving of offense , " he said , " is not always a matter of words spoken . The real incitement to a quarrel may consist in an overt act , a hostile look , even in a state of mind . You , Jacques de Lalain , have given mortal offense to me . From the moment I entered this room you showed contempt in every word you spoke . There was a rancid pride in the very curl of your nostril . The views you expressed were an insult to every man of French birth . " " The fact remains you spoke the words . " " If we can not agree , what course do you propose ? To carry the issue to a Court of Honor ? " The Burgundian snorted again . " If necessary . " " Then , " said D'Arlay , " let us consider some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You openly scoffed at the bravery and prowess of the knights of France . What would be the ruling of a Court of Honor ( ; n these open taunts ? " The quickness with which the Burgundian turned to look at his table companion was proof that his complacency had received a jolt . " I spoke in general terms . " " That makes it worse . You reflected on the courage of the whole knightly body . Give a thought to the consequences before you take the decision outside this room . " Jacques de Lalain squirmed in his chair like a sulky schoolboy thwarted in some pet desire . It was several moments before he broke the silence . " What weapon would you select ? " D'Arlay answered quickly , " My sword . " The Burgundian broke into a loud and confident laugh . " The sword ? " he cried . " Do n't you realize I am the best swordsman in all the world ? " " My own sword , " amended D'Arlay . " You would fight with one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exuberance of De Lalain 's mood subsided slightly . He said sharply , " Let me see it , if you please . " 82 THE MONEYMAN THE MONEYMAN 83D'Arlay detached the weapon from his belt and laid it on the table . His opponent got to his feet and picked it up , touching an exploring finger to the point before hefting it with expert intentness . " It 's a curious one , " he said . " Where did you get it ? " " This type of sword comes from the East originally . This particular blade reached me from Spain . " " I 've never seen one quite like it , " grumbled De Lalain . " It has a womanish blade but the point is keen . " " It will be used without armor of any kind . " " Ha , there would be conditions ! I might have expected it . I can see that a shrewd thrust , or perchance a lucky one , would drive the point clear through a man 's body . " He gave D'Arlay a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This begins to smack of trickery and I care little for the smell of it . " " The advantage would still rest with you . You have asserted your supremacyin the use of all weapons . " " I 've never before held a sword such as this in my hand . " The Burgundian gave a quick cut at the air to test the balance of the blade . Then he raised the hilt and squinted at the tiny inscription in Arabic . It undoubtedly would have added to his misgivings had he been able to decipher the words . Inalienably bequeathed by Alassir-al-Asmeed . May hostile hand that touches this steel wither and rot at the wrist . " It may he you have a special skill in the use of this tricky blade , " he said , after a moment . D'Arlay nodded . " I have skill with it , " he said . " It 's the only weapon I use . " " I wo n't he fluddered into the choice of it ! " The Burgundian threw the sword back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight you like a mincing master of arms . " " Then , " said D'Arlay , " we must leave the matter to a Court of Honor . " De Lalain scowled . " I give you this as my last word : Leave the selection to chance ; toss a coin in the air and abide by the result . " It was D'Arlay 's turn to hesitate . An urgent thought hammered in his mind , " lf you lose , you will surely die ! " He said aloud , " It 's only with the sword that we could fight with any reasonable degree of equality . " The Burgundian refused to move from the stand he had taken . He repeatedstubbornly , " Let it rest on the toss of a coin . " Kennedy , who had been turning back and forth from one to the otherand breathing hard with excitement , plucked at D'Arlay 's sleeve and whispered in his ear , " By St. Andrew , you 'll sign your own death warrant if you give in to this butcher ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coward if I dispute the point any longer . I was rash enough to get myself into this quarrel and now I must face the consequences . " There was a moment of silence and then D'Arlay said loudly : " In God 's name , let it be as you demand ! Toss the coin ! " De Lalain drew a piece of gold from his purse and held it up . " An English noble of Harry Fift ' . A great king and an honorable fighter . I claim the side with the King 's head , D'Arlay . You may have the other with the Cross and arches trefoil . Is it agreed ? " " Agreed . " " I 'm not content with a mere toss of the coin , " declared the greatest knight in Christendom . " There are fingers nimble enough to throw this noble clear to the ceiling and still control the way it will fall . You consort with tricky company , D'Arlay , so I insist on doing it the Burgundian way . I 'll spin the coin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flute glass of good red Burgundian wine . You hand it to me and I turn it upside down . Then we shall see what the god of chance has decided . " " Agreed . " D'Arlay rose to his feet , resting his weight against the table . His whole body was trembling . The Burgundian , his face shining with excitement , gave the coin a preliminary toss , catching it on his wrist . He looked at the exposed face . " The King ! " he cried exultantly . " There 's an augury to give you pause ! Come , D'Arlay , the goblet . Is your hand steady enough to hold it without spilling the wine ? " He threw the noble high into the air . D'Arlay , clutching the goblet in both hands , caught the spinning yellow disk in the wine . It required an effort of will to keep his hands steady as he handed it over to his opponent . The Burgundian turned it upside down on the table and the spilled wine spread out over the cloth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my doughty antagonist ! " cried De Lalain , almost dancingin his eagerness . " Which will we find staring up at us , the King or the Cross ? The King , I swear ; and , if it is , you will die miserably under the blows of my battle-ax . Come , are you afraid to look ? " D'Arlay reached out a hand and raised the goblet . He did not venture a look at the yellow noble resting on the red stain and his first intimation of the result came from the silence of his opponent and an exultant laugh from Pregent Kennedy. 84 THE MONEYMAN " The Cross ! " said De Lalain , in an angry voice . " By the Moine Bourru , it 's the Cross ! " D'Arlay looked then . An intense relief flooded over him . " Never have I seen a more gratifying pattern inscribed on minted gold ! " he said to himself . " An arched molding and a Cross potent . God has decreed I am to have a fair chance . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I must have time to find another plaything like this and to train myself in the use of it . You 'll have that much longer to live , D'Arlay . " He scowled . " You will hear from me when I 'm ready . " " Agreed , " said D'Arlay . " And now , " said D'Arlay , when he and his companion found themselvesagain in the street , " we shall seek the comfort and security of the Rue Grenier sur L'Eau . I confess to a weariness both of mind and body . " The Scot snorted indignantly . " There will be no rest for you for another hour at least . " He laid a commanding hand on D'Arlay 's shoulder . " I know an arms master here in Paris , one Gaspard Soullaine , who has the best hand with the sword I 've ever seen in action . You will be in need of his services , my lord , if you 're to get yourself into proper condition to meet this great bully and braggart. " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I could teach your arms master some things about the use of the sword . " " When Jacques de I , alain summons you to battle , " said the Scot earnestly , " he will have acquired so much skill with this piece of lath that he will be as hard to resist as a blustering wind from the north . Come ! Gaspard'splace is a half hour 's walk from here . We must see him tonight and engage his services . " Chapter VIIIVALERIE went to bed in such a confused state of mind that the only impression she got of her bedroom was of its terrifying grandeur . She roused next morning when the first light of dawn came through the winTHEMONEYMAN 85 ( lows . Wide awake at once , she was gratefully conscious of the softness of the bed on which she lay . She gave a low exclamation of wonder over the coverlet which was embroidered in blue and gold with a most curious device : the heart and shell which , as she learned later , was the Coeur insigne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and immediatelyunder the canopy a shelf for books , and attached to the shelf a bag tilled with aromatic herbs . There was a candlestick on a table and it was at least two feet high and as big around as her wrist . She lay perfectly still for several minutes , thinking of what had happenedthe day before and wondering what plans were hatching in the mind of the owner of this huge stone building . " What a strange man ! " she said to herself . " His eyes seem to burn . I know he 's kind in spite of all his sharpness and the way he hurries . How I wish I knew what he has in mind to do with me ! " She was certain of one thing : that all this mystery had to do with the problem of her parentage . Jacques Coeur had known at first glance who she resembled and had assisted the Sire d'Arlay to the same knowledge . What else could it mean ? " Today , " she said aloud , sitting up in bed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am . " Her thoughts went from there to the Sire d'Arlay and became firmly anchored . This second encounter with him had confirmed the impressions he had carried away from the first . He was not handsome and he had none of the airs and affected manners she associated with highest gentility , hut in spite of that she had no doubt at all that he was a great gentleman . He was showing himself just as kind as he had during that long evening when they labored together at the fashioning of the coffin and she had confided to him so much about herself . She thought , with a surge of pride , " He likes me ! " It was gratifying and exciting to know that he liked her even though she had made no serious effort to define for herself how she Ieft about him . Her thoughts came back to the beauty and wonder of this room . She studied the prie-dieu against one wall . It was tall and had panels of red needlepoint . There was a bench piled up luxuriantly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a crucifix with so much compassiondepicted on the face that her own eyes filled with tears . She measured the width of the bed with an incredulous eye and decided that as many as five people could sleep in it . " How fine to have it all to oneself and be able to stretch right out ! " She had always been cramped as to sleeping space , in the Maret tent and in malodorous rooms in taverns . In fact , there had been for her something mean and furtive86 THE MONEYMAN THE MONEYMAN 87 about slumber , a need to dress and undress hurriedly and under a certain constant inspection . She threw back the covers and set herself to test the width by rolling across the bed . She accomplished six revolutions safely but the seventh projected her over the side . She landed on the floor with a loud thump . She was on the point of raising herself , rather ruefully , when her eyes fixed themselves on a pair of shoes beside a chair . They were unbelievably lovely . The leather was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the first foliage on the trees . The tops were turned back to reveal an inside lining of soft white material . The greatest glory of these amazing shoes , however , was the presence of a bow of yellow velvet on the instep of each . She lay still and looked at them , not fully trusting the evidence of her eyes . Something was wrong ! She had put her clothes the night before on this particular chair and had deposited her own shoes beside it , thinking at the time how out of place they looked . What had happened ? Slowly she raised her eyes , finding further food for surprise at each stage of the elevation . The chair was covered with clothes , but not the old and somewhat bedraggled objects she had left there before getting into bed . All her own clothing was gone and in its stead was a complete new outfit ! She sprang to her feet . She was shivering now , as much from excite- ment as the fact that , according to custom , she had slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she cried , in an ecstatic tone . She lifted with reverent fingers the tunic which was silk and of the same soft green as the shoes . " I low lovely ! These things are fine enough for a lady to wear . " She hesitated over donning the clothes , but another glance about the room convinced her that it was a case of taking this new outfit or not dressing at all . There were no signs of the worn garments she had dis- carded the night before . First she picked up a linen kirtle which was intended for use next to the skin . It was quite plain but so cool that she shivered with delight at the first touch of it . The tunic came next and it fitted her perfectly , with a high waist and a rather daringly low bodice and tight sleeves diapered with gold at the wrists . She found , somewhat to her surprise , that it emitted a rustling sound with every move she made , as though the gown itself had feelings and was expressing its gratification over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then came the hose , which were of such finely spun white wool that she was able to mold them closely and neatly to her legs . Last of all came the shoes , and she marveled at the comfort of them in spite of the snugness of the fit . There was a hat as well , a breath-taking hat of yellow velvet with an cdging of the green . She held it up on one finger and knew it to he perfect . Her mind was racing excitedly . " Who can I be , " she asked herself , " that he thinks me worthy of such costly things ? " The tall stone building was coming to life . Valerie could hear footsteps in the halls and voices raised sharply in admonition and instruction . She went out on the landing of the narrow inside stairway and stared down . There was evidence of considerable activity below and curiosity took possessionof her . Here was a chance to see at close range the inside of this fabulous shop . She began to descend . She was conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich , mysterious . Spices from the East ! She glimpsed through an open door a long room with metal bins extending along both sides and , as the odors were almost overpowering here , she concluded this was the spice storeroom . Through other doors she caught glimpses of rare things  --  beautiful furniture and shining armor and , most interesting of all to her , the sheen of colored materials draped over tall frames . A clerk , with a sheet of paper in his hand , passed her on the stairs at a running gait . She heard him hesitateand then stop ; and she knew that he had turned and was watching her , and wondering , no doubt , who she could be . On each floor she encountered oldish men and women , all of them attiredin gray with a red heart on one arm , who were plying brooms and otherwise setting the place in order for the day 's trading . One of the women , a sharp-faced crone , stopped sweeping as she passed and stared at her with eyes sunk far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw you last e'en when you came , " whispered the woman . " You wore a ragged chammer cloak then , my girl . " Valerie tried to brush by but the crone gripped her by the elbow . " What a pretty little garce you are ! I could tell you things to your profit if you were of a mind to listen to old Dame Trix . " The woman glanced about her furtively and then made a gesture with one finger crooked above the rest . " Do you know the meaning of that ? It 's the sign of the Coquille . You know what that is ! " " No , " said Valerie , who was becoming frightened . " I 'm from the country and I know nothing of Paris . " " You 've brought yourself to the right market , my small one . I 've been able to set many girls from the country in the way of neat profits . " The hoarse voice of the old woman dropped still lower . " Now do n't try to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coquillards . " " I know of one king only , " faltered Valerie . She had heard a great deal , 88 THE MONEYMANas had everyone , about this organization which extended all over France . It was particularly strong in Paris where , she knew , the head of the order lived in hidden splendor . At the moment , however , she had one thought in her head only : to get away from this evil old creature . " Ha ! " grunted the crone . " This king rules the best subjects in Paris . Bold rufflers , with gold in their pilles and ready to spend it all on pretty girls like you . Vendenguns and mercerots and king-davids , who know how to please the ladies as well as pick locks . " She nodded her head on its palsied stalk of neck . " If you want a man like that , my lively sprig , you come to me . Ask for Dame Trix . That 's all , just Dame Trix . And "  --  leeringwith sudden malice  --  " if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll keep a still mouth about what I 've said . " Valerie pulled herself free of the clutching fingers and ran blindly down a dark passage . The desire to get away filled her mind so completely that when she came to a door at one end of the hall , she opened it without thinking . The room in which she found herself seemed familiar to her at once . It had whitewashed walls and many windows through which the light of the early morning sun was beginning to shine . A low oak screen closed off the section in which she stood and beyond it she saw a man hard at work before a table . He looked up at the sound of the closing door and she saw it was Jacques Coeur . " Good morning , my child , " he said , smiling . " I seem to have been successfulin the selection of clothes for you . And how pleasant it is to find that you 're an early riser ! I did n't expect to see you as soon as this . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disturb us . This will be the best time for us to have our talk . " 2The Moneyman had discarded his outer tunic for greater comfort and facility in working and had turned down the collar of his smock . This gave a full view of his neck , which was brown and muscular , an entirely adequate pedestal for his impressive head . His leggings were scarlet on one half and green on the other , as she could see now that he had risen . He had kicked off his shoes and they lay on the floor beside his chair . They looked surprisingly small for a man of his robust proportions . The gold tassels on their upturned green tips would have appeared foppish to anyone not accustomed to the supreme elegance of the day . " Come ! " said Coeur to the girl who was so abashed at the mistake which had brought her into his presence that she had not ventured beyond theTHE MONEYMAN 89door . " Come over here and sit down . I have a hundred questions to ask vou . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjected her to a close scrutiny . Then he nodded his head in approval . " If I had entertained any doubts before , they would now be swept away . You look so much likeliutthat I must leave until later . " It had been no exaggeration when he said he had a hundred questions to ask . He drew out the story of her life , eliciting more information than D'Arlay had secured in his talks with her . He was like a lawyer with a witness on the stand before him . Leaning forward so that no expression of hers escaped him , he shot his questions at her so rapidly that she was in much the same position as a French soldier when arrows from the English archers rained about him ; and , if the truth must be told , with some of the same need to be wary . When he had satisfied himself about her history , he began on questions of a more general nature . " If I gave you a royal d'or , what would you do with it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was startled by the mere mention of such a princely coin . " I 've never even seen one , my lord . " " All the better . What would you do with so much wealth ? " Valerie gave serious thought to the point . " I would have it changed into the smallest coins , even rouges liards , my lord . I would make sure the reckoning was in Parisis and not Tournois so that I would n't be cheated . Then I would put the coins away in many places , never more than two in one place . I would never show more than one Bard at a time and no one would suspect me of having so much . " Coeur nodded his head approvingly before going on to the next question . " Suppose you had a choice to make . Let us say , between a Bible , a gold chain , and a bolt of the best camelot cloth . Which would you take ? " " The bolt of camelot cloth , my lord , " she said without hesitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Can you tell me what guided you in making your selection ? " The girl said to herself with a trace of inner alarm , " Have I given the wrong answer ? " After further thought she began on her explanation . " I would treasure a Bible above everything . But , my lord , I ca n't read and never expect to be able to . Would it be right , then , for me to have a Bible ? There are so very few of them and it would be sinful to waste one on me . It would do so much more good in the hands of people who could read it . " " That , " said Coeur , nodding , " is sound reasoning . You would be wrong to choose the Bible . " 90 THE MONEYMAN " If I had a gold chain , " she went on , " they would say I had stolen it and I would be put in prison . When people like us are put in prison , even if we 're innocent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my lord , we are never again of much use . " " And what of the bolt of camelot cloth ? " " It could be traded for many bolts of plainer material and perhaps even a band of fur and some good beads . There could be a little money over into the bargain ; but not enough to get me into any trouble . So you see , my lord , the cloth would be the practical choice . " " You 've convinced me , Mademoiselle , that your choice was the right one . " His next question was projected with a suddenness that suggested he hoped to catch her off guard . " Tell me about Damian Maret . Was he a mirliton player ? Did he carry the gay-horse on the stage ? " Valerie looked up indignantly . " He was a fine actor , my lord . A very fine actor . He was a musician also , of course ; all actors must be able to play in case of need . But "  --  drawing away and raising her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " If he was a fine actor , why did you live so poorly ? I 'm told he did n't treat you well . " The girl found it hard to keep her indignation from showing in her voice . " Ile did as well for us as he could . " " Come , Mademoiselle , you 're shielding him . You know full well that he was a lazy rascal . I am told also that he drank to excess . Did he beat you when he was in his cups ? " Valerie sprang to her feet . Angry tears filled her eyes . " You 've been kind to mc , my lord , hut you 've no right to speak of him in this way . " " Conic , my child , " said Coeur , in a placating voice . " You must not take amiss what I have said . " " If he drank , " she explained , " it was because he had such bad fortune ! Now that I know what you think of us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk further . " Coeur indulged in an approving laugh . It was clear that he was well pleased with the way she had responded . " Sit down , Mademoiselle . For all I know , Monsieur Maret was the greatest actor in the world and a man of rare and goodly disposition . I was testing your mettle . " He nodded his head and beamed at her . " I 'm glad to find you so loyal . It would have disappointed me very much had I found you meek and unready to speak up . THE MONEYMAN 91 " Mademoiselle , " he went on after a moment , " I have one more question to ask . It refers to something that happened twenty-five years ago . " Valerie 's head came up with sharpened interest . " Twenty-five years ago ? That was when the Maid  --  " " Yes . " Coeur 's voice carried a reverent note . " The most important date in all the long history of France , Mademoiselle . " They looked at each other intently for several moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hint of my purpose , I think , " he said . " Yes , my child , we now come to the point of this questioning which you have so patiently endured . You 've wondered why I asked so many things which seemingly lacked all reason . It was because I had to be sure in my mind first that you had spirit and intelligence , and some common sense as well , before I went any further . " My doubts have been resolved , " he continued , nodding his head . " And now tell me what happened twenty-five years ago . " " It was then the Voices began to speak to the Maid . " " Yes , the Voices spoke in the ear of a peasant girl and told her what must be done to save France . Many in high positions in the state knew already what must be done but they lacked the power to make the King see the truth . God selected His instrument well . He chose a girl of the common people . But , unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to finish the work to which she was called . " He paused to allow his words to have the desired effect . " Valerie , if you had lived then , and the choice had fallen on you , would you have obeyed the Voices ? " " I trust I would have had the courage to obey as the Maid did , " she answered in a low voice . " I 'm sure you would . I 'm sure you would have that same great faith if-i f a second summons came now . " " I think , my lord , that every girl in France dreams of the chance to follow in the footsteps of the Maid . " " Would you be prepared to face the consequences , whatever they might be ? Think well , Valerie Maret , before you answer . It may be that the time has come for another summons . Not a summons to ride into battle in shining armor . The miracle of Jeanne D'Arc can never be repeated . It would take a far different form , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perhaps not more than half-a-dozen people would ever know the truth . Shame and not glory might be the reward you would find . " He paused before asking , " Do you want me to tell you anything more ? " The girl looked into his eyes without any hint of reservation in her own . " Yes , my lord . " 92 THE IvIONEYMAN " There is a long explanation I must make first . I must take you deeply into my confidence and I must have your solemn promise that nothing I tell you will ever be repeated . " " You have my promise . " He began to speak , lowering his voice instinctively as he explained the purpose which had entered his mind when he first saw her. 3When the Moneyman completed his explanation with no more than one sentence to tell what was expected of her , " Someone must take the place of Agnes Sorel , someone with the good of France at heart , and you , Mademoiselle , are my choice , " her reaction was instant and instinctive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my lord Coeur ! You ca n't mean it ! " " But I do mean it . " Her face had become scarlet . " I  --  1 'm not suited . How could I pass myself as a lady at court ? " " You could be taught . I do n't think it would be very difficult to fit you for the role . You 've good blood in your veins , unless all the signs are at fault . You 're bright and quick . Yes , my small one , you would soon learn all the tricks and wiles of a great lady . " " But , my lord , do n't you see that  --  that I shrink from the thought of such a life ! " " The Maid did n't shrink from the kind of life she knew was ahead of her . " " But that was different ! It was glorious ! She rode in white mail at the head of the armies of France . There was nothing shameful about it . " " She died a shameful death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come of it but she did n't draw back . But , my child , it 's not my intent to urge this on you . You must think it over and decide for yourself . All I want to say is this : I have no doubts whatever that you could carry on the part Agnes Sorel has played . " Valerie turned her head away so that he could not see her face . She fixed her eyes on the nearest window through which sunlight was now pouring generously . " My lord Coeur , does it not seem strange to you that it 's the Lady Agnes I resemble ? " " When we have time to investigate thoroughly we may find some blood relationship to account for it . " She kept her head lowered as though unwilling to meet his eyes while talking of such matters . " What , " she asked , " would I have to do to fit myself for life at court ? " THE MONEYMAN 93 " You would need an education . It would be necessary to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginnings of such things , fortunately . A lady is not supposed to read like a scholar or write like an ecrivain ; her gentility would be suspect if she did . I 'm sure , my child , that everything else would come easily enough to you . Down inside yourself you are more of a lady now than many I know who were born to great estate . " " How long would it take ? " " Six months perhaps . " " And after that ? I mean , if  --  if the plan should succeed ? " The Moneyman 's eyes narrowed in calculation . " The war will be finishedin less than a year . I 'm ready to stake my official head that it will be short and decisive . We 'll clear France of the enemy before another winter . ... The rudder must not fall into weak hands for five years after peace comes . . . . Your age is sixteen at a guess . You could give us six years and still have all the best of your life before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Would there be enough years left to  --  to make my peace ? " Jacques Coeur 's face sobered at once . Reaching out , he took possession of both her hands . " Do you believe that what I have asked you to do is a sin in the eyes of God ? " he asked . " I 've never taken my God out of a book nor fashioned Him in my mind from priestly words . He may be stern but He is just . He knows how much France needs peace and honest rule , how terribly her people will suffer if these are denied them any longer . Can it be sinful to help bring this about ? " He pressed her hands reassuringly . " The God I know is a very wise God , understanding and human , and He would not weigh a small transgression against a great accomplishment ! " Nothing more was said for several moments . She was turning over in her mind the things he had told her , sitting meanwhile in a rigid position , hands clasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was distressed to see that there had been a distinct change in her appearance . Her cheeks had become pale and there was a trace of violet shadow under her eyes . The resemblance had become more pronounced . Finally she began to speak . " I must have time , my lord . I know that everything you 've said must be true . And yet  --  and yet I ca n't be reconciled to what it would mean . " " You must take all the time you want . " " Must you know today ? " " No , my child . Not today . Nor tomorrow . Nor the day after that . " She sighed deeply . " Then I will think about it . I will try to conquer my feelings , but I must tell you that I do n't think I shall succeed . " 94 THE MONEYMANHe reached out a hand and raised her face so that he could look into her eyes . " Take all the time you need , " he repeated slowly . " You must come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest care  --  and with your heart as well as your mind . I want you to know this : if the answer is Yes , it must be reached willingly . You must be entirely sure of your readiness to make this sacrifice . Otherwise , I want your answer to be No . " She turned and walked to the door . Here she stopped and hesitated . Finally , with a suggestion of color once more in her cheeks , she came back to him . " Does  --  does the Sire d'Arlay know of this ? " " I told him yesterday what I had in mind . " " Is it  --  is it permissible to ask what he thought of it ? " Coeur looked at her shrewdly , suspecting that this might prove a crucial point with her . He answered , however , with complete frankness , " He was against it , my child . " " May I ask why ? " " The Sire d'Arlay is a man of high ideals and great generosity . But he 's not logical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it becomes necessary to throw the cargo overboard , no matter how valuable it may be . D'Arlay knows that the ship of state is in clanger of being wrecked but he would rather go down with all hands than part , for instance , with his belief that the honorable and proper thing should always be done . That is fine for him but what of the poor crew ? " The Moneyman paused and smiled . " I 'm fond of Robin and you must n't think I speak of him in anger . There is this also , Mademoiselle , to account for his attitude . He likes you , and wants to spare you . " Valerie bowed . " Thank you , my lord . It was kind of you to explain . " 4On the third day , having received no word from Valerie , Jacques Coeur went to the factor 's wife . She was a talkative woman , with a tendency to dramatize everything : by intonation , by gesture , by expression , most of all with a flow of detail she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This girl I do n't understand , " she admitted . " She 's interested in nothing . I talk to her ; she does n't listen . I cook for her the best ; she does n't eat . I make for her rye bread , fresh from the oven , and all women know it 's good to preserve the beauty . Lentil soup by my own mother 's recipe . And sambocades ! Ah , such richness of curds and whey , baked in a coffin of crust and flavored as it should be with elder flowers . But will she eat ? No , THE MONEYMAN 95my lord , she takes a few bites and then she says , ' I have no more appetite . ' But that cat , it eats enough for her ! It eats everything I give it and then it goes back to my kitchen and steals the fish heads , and then it goes downstairs and eats the food of Old Benedisto who tends the rear gate and who brings his meals wrapped up in cabbage leaves . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Moneyman . " That , my lord , is hard to answer . She sits and stares out of windows and , if you ask her questions  --  which I have done a hundred times  --  she does n't answer . She goes to the oratory and prays . Once only she seems to come to life . She laughs and talks about Mysteries and about her mules and about the time when the rope and the hook which lifted an actor off the stage broke and dropped him on his fat Guillaume . It was this morning , my lord . She even takes my children down to the grass bailey and plays with them there . She teaches them a game called Tat-and-Spat . And she imitates for them . " " Imitates ? " " Yes , my lord . She makes herself like people she has seen about the shop . Eduard , the little old bachelor who sells in Eastern Silks and who has to put his thumb in his mouth when he reckons . And Dame Trix who is a sweeper and who drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stables . But it was for a short time only , my lord . She has the cockroach again as soon as she gets back , and not another word does she say . " Father Francois was even more disturbed about her . " Monseigneur , she prays by the hour , " he reported . " I 've tried to be of help to her but she says there is nothing she can tell me . I said to her , Daughter , what great sin have you committed which can not be told to a man of God ? ' Her answer was that it was about the future she prayed and not the past . I 've questionedher at length , Monseigneur , but she gives me no slightest hint of what she has on her mind . " Coeur said to himself , " She 's not the tattling kind to run to neighbors or the priest with everything . That is good . " Father Francois seemed to feel that he was proving neglectful . " What more can I do , Monseigneur ? Must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her troubles ? " " This much I know about it , Father : there 's nothing you can do to help her . " The Moneyman encountered Valerie that afternoon . It happened to be in the Armory and she was standing in one of the windows , gazing out in the mood of complete preoccupation which had so disturbed the factor's96 THE MONEYMANwife . The sun was pouring through , making her hair glisten warmly and striking on the well-polished surfaces of a suit of mail by which she was standing . Coeur said to himself , " If an artist put that on canvas , people would think it a picture of the Maid . " She turned at the sound of his steps . When she came forward to meet him , she had shaken off the mood of abstraction entirely . He knew at once that she had made up her mind and , also , what her decision had been . " I shall do as you wish in the matter , my lord . " Coeur studied her face with a gravity which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have all the fears and reservations left you ? " She nodded slowly . " Yes , my lord . " " And you 're entirely willing to make the sacrifice ? " She answered in a low tone . " I 've come to see that it 's not en1y my duty but my privilege . Yes , my lord , I am willing . Sometimes even I find that I 'm glad . I 'm so sure about it now that I wonder why I did n't see it clearly at first . How slow and stupid I have been ! Taking three days to make up my mind ! " " I 'm glad you took the time , Valerie . Now your mind is made up so firmly that it wo n't change with every twirl of the weather vane . This wo n't be easy for you , my child . There will be plenty of ups and downs ; there will he days when everything will seem wrong . There will be times when you will weary of the hard work and the uncertainty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that there will be danger ? " " Yes , my lord . But at no time have I been concerned about that . " She wore a worried frown , nevertheless , when she asked , " When do I begin ? " " I 've a plan which I hope to get settled this evening . If all goes well , your education will start tomorrow . " Valerie tried to face this fact cheerfully but he noticed that her chin trembled a little . " 1 fear , my lord , " she whispered , " that I will be a very poor scholar . " The Moneyman continued to study her face with an absorption which kept him silent for some moments . " Today you remind me of the young Agnes so much that I am carried back , " he said at last . " I can almost believe myself at the King 's court on the day when she first came . Ah , she was so young , so lovely , so very grave ! She won all our hearts  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did the first time I saw her . She was in a green gown ; and I think that memory must have prompted me in selecting this dress for you , my child . Her cheeks lacked the tan of yours and her hair was done in a different way . But otherwise you are the young Agnes I remember so well . . . . I think , my child , that the resemTHEMONLYMANblance goes deeper than looks . You seem to have the same spirit , the courage , the sweet good temper I 've always loved in her ! " Chapter VIIIiJACQUES COEUR took a pride in having systems for everything . In the room he used at the Louvre  --  all the other ministers had suites , with chapels , refectories , pantries , even cellars of their own and stables for their horses and armories and formal gardens  --  there was a long table with an equally long bench behind it . Each day when he arrived , he would find piles of letters and documents at intervals along the table . When he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench to the next ; and facing him would be the official with whom he was to discuss the matters contained therein . When he reached the end of the bench , his duties as Moneyman were over for the time being . On the day Valerie reached her decision , he completed his tasks at a relatively late hour . Walking to one of the windows , he looked down into a busy courtyard of the palace . Men , looking dwarfed at the distance , were coming and going in the jingling harness of war . With a sudden sense of satisfaction he said to himself , " That 's one thing they 'll never be able to take away from me , that I persuaded Charles to the need of finishing the struggle . " Nicolas came stumbling through the dusk of the room , saying in an aggrieved tone : " And why did n't you light the candles , master ? Do you think yourself above such ordinary needs as light or do you fancy yourself a cat to see in the dark ? The Sire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door in his face ! " There was a hint of jocularity in Coeur 's voice as he said , " Show the splendid fellow in , Nicolas . " The " splendid fellow " proved to be a foppishly dressed young man with a black patch over one eye . Any observer who caught the slyness and greed in the other would have been forgiven for thinking that the accident , if accident it had been , would have been much more of a boon had it resulted in closing both . Coeur waited for Nicolas to withdraw and then addressed his visitor. 98 THE MONEYMAN THE MONEYMAN 99 " Come and sit beside me , my honest Georges , so that we can talk in low tones . In no other way can we discuss the kind of business which always brings you here , my perfect paragon of honesty . " The visitor , whose skin seemingly was thick enough to absorb any amount of verbal pricking or bludgeoning , seated himself at the table with no suggestion of umbrage . He said in an even tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double the usual fee . " " I 'll judge of that , " declared Coeur sharply , " after I have heard what it is . " The young man with the black patch was watching the Moneyman closely with his one eye . " It 's the most vital piece of information I 've ever had for sale . I 've some hesitation about telling it , as you will understand , my lord Coeur . There is danger in passing it on . " " Speak up ! " said Coeur impatiently . " We both know that the skin of an informer is always in some danger . Is n't it rather that the odor this time is so strong that even your well-seasoned nostrils can feel a distaste ? " The Sire d'Antenne proceeded to tell his story . He had called to see his sister , who was married to Guillaume Gouffier and was in ill-health because of the imminence of her fourteenth child . By some error of calculation ( he smiled as he gave this information , as though proud of what he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's quarters but in a small room which opened into a larger apartment where Gouffier conducted his affairs . He had become aware at once that his sister 's husband had importantvisitors . There was a murmur of voices from the larger room , many of which he had no difficulty at all in identifying . With a skill in such matters which he regarded clearly as an accomplishment , he had succeeded in opening the door slightly and in spying out the land . There were seven men in the room . He had recognized all of them . The talk going on inside had reached his ears in snatches only but he had heard enough to realize that the gathering was not a chance one , that it had been called by Gouf3 " ier for a specific purpose . He paused at this point and waited . " And what was the purpose , my expert at keyholes , my agile gatherer of gossip ? " " To discuss ways and means of persuading the King to dispense with the services of his Moneyman . " Coeur smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation . " They will find they are too early . I 've not yet paid the whole cost of the war . " " They 're not looking at the immediate future , my lord Coeur . Theywo n't make any kind of move until after Rouen has been taken . ' 1 ' 11 ( .11 , my not-too-generous employer , watch yourself ! The pack will be upon you ! " " My ill-wishers grow more daring , it seems . They 're no longer content to snap at my heels like a pack of jackals . What form will the attack take , when it comes ? " There had been talk , explained the informer , of getting together evidence to lay before the King . The management of the mint at Bourges , which Coeur had controlled in the earliest days of the reign , had come in for much discussion ( Coeur smiled at this , for Charles had lived at Bourges then and had been so poor that he had needed to clip the coinage in order to have meat on his table ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bombards to the Turks to assist them in their war against Christian states . While the bearer of tales was telling what he had seen and heard , Jacques Coeur was piling up coins on the table in front of him in the form of a pyramid . He had seemed completely absorbed in this occupation but in reality he had missed nothing . He looked up the instant the story came to an end . " And you 'll tell me the names of the seven men ? " " If the fee is to be doubled . " " The fee will be doubled , my spotless paladin , my cavalier of clean conscience . See ! It 's ready for you here . " The man with the black patch named the conspirators , counting on his fingers as he did so . At the end Coeur nodded his head with a return of his sardonic mood . " I could have named them myself , I think , " he said . " They would all profit personally by my removal . It happens that six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He raised both hands and then dropped them inertly on the table . " These brave and honorable knights should be grateful to me . I 'm paying for a war in which they will have a chance to display their gallantry and win renown for themselves . Instead they plot my ruin . The Sire d'Antenne counted the coins with great care . Then he nodded and rose to his feet . He seemed well pleased with himself . " That patch on your eye is the sign of a war pledge no doubt , " said Coeur . " Yes , my lord **27;2141;TOOLONG . I 've sworn not to discardit until I 've performed some noble deed in the fighting with the Engloys . " Coeur laughed mirthlessly . " I 've heard of half-a-dozen other greatknights who are wearing patches for the same reason . I could give you the100 THE MONEYMANnames of three who have forsworn a certain pleasurable rite , in which their ladies would play a part , until the enemy has been driven from the country . How unfortunate it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ! I know of one who has declared himself not to bathe until his doughty arm has brought him just acclaim . Not that the oath will make any particular difference in his habits . " His voice rose . " I would like to propose a more useful and logical oath for the lot of you to swear . That you will obey the orders of your leader when it comes to the fighting . That you wo n't charge when you see fit yourselves  --  as you did at Azincourt and so lost the battle  --  but wait until the order is given . That you wo n't scorn to protect your archers , because the poor fellows are of low degree , nor allow the enemy to cut them to pieces while his own bowmenrain deadly arrows on the army of France ! In other words , that you will behave like real soldiers and not like sulky and overhearing fools ! " " You seem to have little respect for chivalry , my lord Coeur . " " So little , Sire d'Antenne , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a buyer of secrets and so only a degree better than you , a seller . I do n't need to tell you , my model of rectitude , that all ministers of the King employ spies to know what is going on ! You sell to all of them , I do n't doubt . But under the circumstances I 'm not in a position to suggest that another oath you might take would be not to sell information about your friends . " The wearer of the patch smiled without a trace of rancor . " I need the money , " he said . He waved a hand jauntily as he was leaving the room . " 1 'll continue to serve you , Jaquet the Fox , as long as you have gold to pay mc . " Coeur called out in a sudden burst of anger : " Nicolas , Nicolas ! Get a window open in there ! That splendid fellow has polluted the air ! " 2Jacques Coeur was late in reaching the Grand Salon . The long tables were already filled and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roast meats with orange juice and rose water and sprinkling them with salt and sugar and spices . At first glance it was impossible to see much more of the company than the towering headdresses of the ladies . Some of these rose as much as three feet above the heads of their wearers and no two were alike . There were some which resembled windmillswith broad surfaces of shimmering satin , a few which sported horns as widespread as a stag 's , others which were heart-shaped with armorial bearings picked out in precious stones , and many which were further cornTHEMONEYMAN 101plicated by bands of velvet looped around the head and falling to the floor . The general effect was much the same as that produced by a company of standard-bearers in a victory processional or a saint 's day parade . Coeur perceived at once that the company had taken advantage of the fact that the royal family were enjoying their meal in the privacy of the Queen 's own salon by relaxing ceremonial to the extent of supping a deux . Each gentleman was sharing his plate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levity had developed . There was one vacant chair and into this the Moneyman slipped quietly . " I begged the privilege of your company tonight , my lord Coeur , " said the lady who was to share his plate . " For a long time I 've desired a chance to talk with you . " She was a mature beauty of thirty or perhaps even a few years in excess of that turning point in the lives of the women of the day . Her warm brown eyes smiled at him from under a comparatively inconspicuous hennin of velvet . Coeur was surprised that the much-sought-after Comtesse de Burey should have expressed a preference for his company , and his manner showed it . " I 'm most deeply honored , Comtesse , " he said , with a bow . " This is doubly fortunate , as I 've desired a talk with you . We have an interest in common . " " Yes , " she agreed . " You refer , of course , to my brother-in-law . I had a note from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his return . " Isabeau de Burey allowed the furred edge of her fan to brush her companion'sshoulder with the slightest suggestion of coquetry . " I make no secret of the fact that I 'm interested in everything he does . But you need not look so disturbed , my lord Coeur . I was in accord with the purpose which kept him away so long . " The Moneyman studied her face with a steady eye . " I 'm indeed happy to know that , Comtesse , " he said . " We still need every adherent , particularlyone whose charm can be of service to us . " " I 've been such a loyal supporter of your policy that some on the other side have treated me coldly , " whispered the Comtesse . " Even my husband had been won over to our way of thinking . Not "  --  with a sudden hardeningof her very lovely eyes  --  " that Regnault 's support would ever be of much help to you . He has shown such a capacity for making enemies ! " Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun to dip his spoon into the soup before them . " The royal cook is doing us special honor tonight , " he said . " This soupe doree was the great Taillevent 's most conspicuous triumph . I can never resist it . " 102 THE MONEYMAN THE MONEYMAN 10iThe rich potage clearly was a dish that none of the company could resist . It was made of slices of brown toast fried in yolks of egg and white wine and then floated in rose water , sprinkled with saffron and sugar . The ladies and gentlemen alike were spooning it up voraciously . The Comtesse shook her head sadly . " It 's too rich for me . I am no longer young "  --  she paused as though willing to have him enter a denial  --  " and there is no longer any doubt that I can take on weight too readily . It 's a great trial . " He was well aware , nevertheless , that her throat and shoulders , generouslyexposed in the mode of the moment , displayed a dazzling white roundness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovelier every day , " he said . A squire de gobelet poured wine into the cup they were to share . Coeur raised it with an appreciative hand and offered it to his companion . " Saint-Pourcain ! " he said . " We are indeed being honored . The very best of all wines . Will you condescend to take the first drink ? " The Comtesse took a sip and then handed the cup back to him . " Robin has been most secretive on one score , " she said , returning to the subject which interested her most . " He has never let me know the exact nature of the relationship between you . Is it such a very great secret , then ? I confess to being an inquisitive person , my lord . " Coeur took a sleep swallow of the wine . " I see no reason why it should he a secret at all . IYArlav has never shown any reluctance to having it known that he has an interest in my enterprises . In fact , I 've every reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in what the rest of our company here tonight would call ' vulgar trade . ' What is it you want to know ? " " Well , " she said , " how it began , for instance . " " I can understand why he has never told you that . I saw him for the first time on an occasion when his spirits were very low . Someone he thought a great deal of , Comtesse , was being married . I advised him to go away and even took the liberty of suggesting he sail on one of my ships . He acted on the suggestion and it did him much good . We have been friends ever since . " As he spoke Coeur was watching the profile of his companion . It was well worth studying : a good brow , a delicately arched nose with proudly chiseled nostrils , full eyelids , and lashes of unusual length . " No wonder Robin was so unhappy when she threw him aside , " he said to himself . " She must have been irresistible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and selfishness , but he was not entirely inclined to accept thisestimate . Court beauties were always the targets for envy and mall , ions tittle-tattle . He went over in his mind the stories circulated about Isabe.ur de Burey : She had tried hard but without success to succeed Agnes Sorel in the affections of the King ; she thought of little else but her looks . nid even went to such extremes as bathing in strawberry juice and drinking vinegar instead of wine to retain the milky whiteness of her skin ; she paid visits to a learned doctor at the University who was said to dabble in magic and who was even rumored to be on the point of discovering the Philosopher 's Stone ; she cared for her husband 's brother much more than she did for the Comte and made it clear to the latter that she had married him for his title alone . Coeur was sure of one item only in this indictment , the last named . " Quite a few years ago , " went on the Moneyman , " I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleet of ships and I had , perhaps , rushed into construction more boldly than was wise . I was so hard pressed that it was a great help when D'Arlay made inc a loan . I 've always considered that he did me a great service . " " I did know of the loan . " " It was bold of him as well as generous . His share of the estates , into which he had just come , was badly stretched in the process . In fact , he found it necessary to put a mortgage on his lands . " " I did n't know of the mortgage . Regnault would have been furiously opposed if he had heard of it . " " I am telling you this in confidence , Madame . The loan was well protected . I did better for him than a bottomry bond by which he would have had for security a certain ship and could lose everything if that ship went down ; I gave him his security , in fact , on the goods in my shops and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly enough but I felt that his trust had placed me under a never-ending obligation . Ever since I have consideredhim a silent partner and he shares in certain of the profits . He will always do so . " The Comtesse continued to watch him with a speculative eye . " It 's within the bounds of possibility then that my sweet Robin may become a very rich man ? " Their plate had been filled with gobbeted trout . The Comtesse refrained from eating but Jacques Coeur began to ply an enthusiastic knife . " Will you forgive me if I indulge in a boast ? " he asked between mouthfuls . " He 's a rich man now as a result of this share in my enterprises . He should become very much richer as time goes on . " " I 'm very happy to hear it , " whispered the Comtesse. 104 THE MONEYMAN " You see , Madame , " went on the Moneyman , not averse to fanning the regrets she might be harboring over her matrimonial mistake , " my enterprisesare different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no limit to the growth I foresee . Actually I 've made no more than a start . Your brother-in-law continues to help me in many ways . He will continue a partner , a silent one it is true , in the  --  the empire of trade I am building . " The trout had been succeeded by venison and furmenty , a combination invented two generations before by Taillevent , the famous royal cook of that clay . The wheaten flour of the furmenty was boiled in milk with melted sugar and cardamom seeds and the result was a piquant accompaniment to the strong flavor of the meat . It was a favorite dish of Coeur 's but the Comtesse did not touch it , contenting herself with a small mound of marrois which one of the helpers placed on her side of the plate . Into this well-spiced combination of hashed fish and cod 's liver she dipped a sparing knife at intervals . " I 'm the richest man in the world today , " declared the Moneyman proudly . His eyes were glowing with enthusiasm but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he could not be heard by anyone else at the table . " What will I do with my wealth if it continues to grow ? I do n't know . In fact , I never give that a thought . I 'm not doing this for the sake of money . I like power but I 'm not thinking of that either . I lack words to tell you the vision that prompts me to go on and yet I can see the future clearly enough . The world will he a different place , a better place , when commerce becomes man 's chief interest and "  --  he paused significantly  --  " when soldiers are considered of small account . Comtesse , that 's what I am striving to bring about : to make the rules of the countinghouse of more moment than the Code of Chivalry , to provide a greater degree of comfort and happiness for all people . It 's coming . Nothing can hold it hack . I want to bring that welcome day closer . " " I find it hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the Comitcssc . " But  --  you are a most ardent advocate , my lord Coeur . " The royal cook had provided a special Warner , the dish which served as an intimation that the course had been finished and another was to begin . It consisted of two figures , almost life size , representing a shepherd and shepherdess made of various kinds of edibles . There was an artist in the kitchen , a potential Phidias born to waste his talents among pots and pans and to work in lard and pastry instead of enduring stone . The figures were startlingly real . The faces had been faithfully contrived out of browned dough and they smirked at each other in bucolic fidelity . EachTHE MONEYMAN 105carried a small basket . When the lid of one was lifted , a pair of canaries began to sing inside . Doves flew out from the other , a half dozen or inure . They flapped confidently about the room and even perched on the shoal ders of the company in expectation of being fed . Jacques Coeur joined in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunged back into conversation without any delay . " You 've known D'Arlay a long time , Comtesse ? " " Yes , Monsieur . All my life . The estates of our families adjoined in Anjou , although the De Burey lands were much more extensive than my father 's holdings . We were much of an age , Robin and I. You perceive , my lord , that my honesty is great enough for even such a damaging ad- mission as that . We played together as children and I saw him every day as we grew up . Robin was a kind and gentle boy and a very good com- panion . I was always fond of him . " " But you married his older brother . " " Yes , I married his brother . " There was a pause . " You are an ambitious woman , I think , Comtesse , " said Coeur . Isabeau de Burey nodded in agreement . " That is true . 1 sec no reason for not acknowledging that I would like to have more influence at court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more intelligence than most of these "  --  she lowered her voice cautiously  --  " these very stupid people about us . " It was to better your chances , then , that you married the Comte de Burey ? You wanted the title ? " The brown eyes of the Comtesse narrowed slightly before she nodded a second time . " You have asked me a direct question and I feel disposed to give you a frank answer . Yes , my lord Coeur , I married Regnault for his title and the position it would give me at court . He has been a great dis- appointment to me and I feel no need to conceal the truth on his behalf . " " Did D'Arlay understand the reason for your preference ? " " Not entirely . He charged me with it at the time but I  --  I denied it . He was even more modest then and so he found it easy to believe I could prefer his brother . " She dipped her hands in a ewer of hot water offered by one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draped on the handle . " I do n't know why I am telling you this . I 'm making admissions , in fact , which will give you a very bad opinion of me . " Coeur took a final drink of wine and shoved the goblet aside as a signal it was not to be refilled . He turned to study his companion more closely . " It is in your mind perhaps that you could be of use to me ? " 106 THE MONEYMAN THE MONEYMAN 107The Comtesse returned his gaze steadily . " It has seemed to me possible . You need friends at court . " " Yes , Comtesse , it 's possible I may need friends in the unpredictable days ahead of us . A lady of your position , and with your charm , could be useful to me . " He asked , after a moment , " Are you in need of funds ? " " Always , " she sighed . " My selfish spouse has been very extravagant . Our debts are heavy  --  so heavy that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still keep up appearances . " " Have you ever applied to D'Arlay for assistance ? " She hesitated before answering . " I 've been so frank with you already that I might as well tell you everything . Even if it gives you a still worse opinion of me . Yes , my lord , I have sought his help when  --  when things became particularly difficult . " " And has he been willing to help ? " " Of course . My dear Robin is the most generous of men . He has never needed more than a word from me . " " In return for what you may be able to do for me , you might prefer to come to me when the necessity arises . " The Comtesse did not withdraw her eyes . " That possibility has occurred to me . " A born bargainer , Coeur liked nothing better than to have the lead come from the other party to a transaction . He said to himself with satisfaction , " This is a fortunate coincidence . I 'm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It happens , Comtesse , that you could be of direct aid to me now , " he said aloud . " There 's a rather delicate undertaking which I think could be put safely in your hands . It would be a profitable venture for you . " The lady had an instinct for bargaining also . She said nothing . " Before I explain the nature of it , " Coeur continued , " I must touch on a delicate point without any bearing on the undertaking itself . I must make a stipulation . You wo n't like what I 'm going to say but I 'm always forthrightin my dealings and I believe in speaking openly and to the point . " The lady 's eyebrows raised slightly and involuntarily but she answered in even tones , " 1 'm ready to listen to anything you have to say , my lord Coeur . " " I 'm very fond of Robin , " said Coeur , after a moment . " It 's a matter of deep regret to me to realize that he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actively unhappy . He enjoys such work as I entrust to him . He has his books and he dabbles a little in philosophy and science . But here he is , a man of thirty or so and still unmarried . He should have half-a-dozen childrenaround his house by this time . Books are a poor substitute for . t family , Comtesse . I 'm beginning to fear he will never marry now ; and that is a bleak prospect for a man of his disposition . I 'm quite disturbed about him . " " I 've never stood in the way of his marrying , " said Isabeau . " Not directly , or openly , perhaps . But I wonder if he 's likely to think of any other women as long as a certain bond remains unbroken ? If that bond were snapped or permitted to fray , I think he would soon find someone to suit him . I 'm certain of one thing , Comtesse : you , and you only , are in a position to break that bond . " A long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Coeur won . " Am Ito understand this is your stipulation ? " she asked . Coeur nodded . " Make me a promise to do everything you can to break that bond , Comtesse , and I 'll be so generous with you in the other matter that you will never know any financial embarrassment again . " For the first time a touch of color showed in her usually cool white cheeks . Watching her closely , Coeur realized that she was finding it difficult to control her resentment . He waited anxiously , not sure that her need for security would get the upper hand . She asked finally , " Must I give you this  --  this extraordinary pledge before you tell me the nature of the undertaking ? " The Moneyman said to himself triumphantly , " She 's going to agree . " Through force of habit he waited before answering . " I may tell you this much , that it would involve taking a young girl under your tutelage and care for a period . Before saying anything more , I must ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information I have received is correct . " " As you wish . " Convinced in his mind now of the outcome , he asked , " You had an uncle named Gilles de Voudrai with estates in the southern part of Berri ? " " Yes . My uncle Gilles died about ten years ago . " " He had many children , I believe , most of them illegitimate . " The Comtesse permitted herself to smile . " A great many . " " What did he do to provide for those born out of wedlock ? " " Nothing that I know of . My uncle was not a rich man . He had squanderedhis resources and his estate was in a sad condition when he died . " " Have his heirs concerned themselves over the plight of his illegitimate issue ? " " Knowing my cousins as I do , I 'm quite sure they 've done nothing at all . THE MONEYMAN 10 ' ) Do you wish to imply that they 've been negligent or unnatural in the matter ? " Coeur shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethics of the situation . I want to be sure of one thing . Have your cousins kept track of them ? " Isabeau indulged in an easy laugh . " If you had known my uncle Gilles , you would n't require an answer . There were too many of them , Monsieur . I 'm not sure that even he knew how many he had . There is nothing unusualabout that . " Supper was over . There was a loud scraping of chairs on the stone floor as the company rose to leave . Most of them paused by the door where servitors offered them the spiced boute-hors which brought each meal to a close . There was a loud clatter of talk . " I 'm satisfied now to tell you what I have in mind , Comtesse , " said Coeur . " Do you feel disposed to give me more of your time when we reach the apartments of the Queen ? " Isabeau kept her eyes lowered . " I  --  I must think of what you have said first . " Coeur smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision , permit me to say this has been a most pleasant and profitable supper . I 've enjoyed your company very much . " Chapter IXrA ( iAl.1 took possession of Paris that night . It came from the northwest and roared clown the river and over the rooftops . It was not the mischievouskind , snatching at hats and making clotheslines dance , but a baleful storm with fingers of ice and lungs of steel . It brawled fiercely about the spires of churches and forced its way through faults in the glazing to mutter in the aisles like the whisper of heresy . It swirled down the streets and caused tavern signs to swing like bells in a steeple . By morning the river was rolling in yellow turbulence . Masses were being sung in empty churches and the shutters of most shops remained up . D'Arlay had intended to make several visits but a single glance from the window of his bedroom on one of the top floors of the house in theRue Grenier sur L'Eau was sufficient to dissuade him from that purpose . He decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside an unfinished object made of clay which occupied a small table against one of the walls . It consisted of a round cylinder about two feet in length protruding from a cradle of crossbars . It was not hard to recognize , for it was an excellent model of a bombard , the new kind of cannon which was to be used against the Lnglish . He and Pregent Kennedy had filled in time by making it but had not yet finished the equipment for breech-loading and firing . And now it would remain unfinished , for Pregent Kennedy had left . He had returned the previous noon after a visit to the headquarters of Jacques Coeur and had proceeded immediately to pack his saddlebags with his meager belongings . As usual he had volunteered no information at all . " You are going away ? " D'Arlay asked , standing over him as lie meticulouslyfolded in his one change of underclothes . " Aye . I am grateful to you for your kindness in letting me fill a humble bed in your handsome house but I 'll have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " May I ask what brought about this sudden change of plan ? " The Scot straightened up and gave frowning consideration to the advisability of answering . " I go , " he said finally , " at the behest of the Money-. man . " " Does your mission concern Valerie Maret ? " Another long pause . " Aye . I go to Berri to make inquiries about her . I 'll be gone for several weeks at the least reckoning . " D'Arlay nodded his head approvingly . He was glad an effort was to be made to trace the girl 's parentage , and convinced that no better agent could have been selected . By further questioning he learned that Kennedy knew nothing more , except that Valerie still lived with the family of the factor and was not to be seen by visitors . He , Kennedy , had been denied the opportunity of talking with her before leaving . When the Scot had tossed the saddlebags over his shoulder and departed , D'Arlay realized that he could no longer keep up his pretense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all his strength of will to keep from rushing to Coeur to protest still more urgently than he already had done and to the girl herself to prevent her from making such a serious mistake . Each day he had paced up and down , wondering what had happened between Coeur and Valerie , even his anxiety about the forthcoming duel relegated to the back of his mind. 110 THE MONEYMAN THE MONEYMAN 111Having decided against the idea of venturing out into the rain-swept streets himself , he was surprised when a step on the stairs announced a visitor . It was Gaspard , the arms master . He came in with water dripping from his clothes and trickling down his cheeks and nose . " I did n't expect you in weather like this , " said D'Arlay . " A man must live , " declared the arms master cheerfully . " If I did n't come here , my lord , I would have nothing to do today and the state of my purse makes idleness a luxury I ca n't afford . " D'Arlay took clown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gave it a preliminary cut with the feeling of satisfaction he always enjoyedwhen it was in his hand . " I 'm disposed to think , Gaspard , " he said , " that you will come off second best today . Very much second best . I feel in the mood for swordplay . This good blade of mine fairly tugs at my hand . " The arms master contented himself with saying , " I will do my best , " as he threw off his sodden cloak and rolled up the sleeves of his tunic . He was a stockily built fellow with muscles which rippled under the brown skin of his arm . His movements were deliberate , but when he took a step forward it was easily to be seen that his whole body was like a beautifullyadjusted machine . D'Arlay advanced , treading on his toes in eagerness to begin , his blade extended in front of him . " On guard ! " he cried . The swords touched and held for the customary moment . Then D'Arlay drew back and lunged vigorously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master parried the thrust . The bout was on ; and an exultant power coursed through D'Arlay 's arm as he went seriously to work . This mood did not last , however . Facing him , as he countered his opponent 's steel , was a stained-glass window representing Samson with jawbone in hand . D'Arlay had never been pleased with the subject . Now , as he advanced and retreated and lunged and parried , he was less pleased than ever . The uplifted arm of the strong man seemed to him to representthe might of Jacques de Lalain and he fancied he could see a slight resemblance to himself in the cringing Philistine on whom the jawbone was descending . Isabeau had been responsible for nearly everything about this house in the Rue Grenier sur L'Eau . As soon as he had acquired it , she had descended on him with a builder and a glassmaker in tow and had taken over the direction of the improvements . It was a house of the type known as foreland , with masonry foundations and a succession of frame upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street until the roofseemed in imminent danger of toppling over ; a picturesque structure in its original guise , with N-shaped beams and thatch of red and vcllowww plaster and an infinity of quaint design in the woodwork both inside and out . There were moments now when he did not like his Paris home at all . Isabeau had succeeded in converting it into an imitation of the pretentious hotels of the great families ; but , he thought , a not particularly successful one , despite the fact that the windows blazed with all the hues known to the glassmakers and the ceiling of the ground floor had been ripped out to give him an imposing and thoroughly uncomfortable Great Hall . Despite the parallel he had read into the subject of the glass window , he was quite pleased with himself when the bout came to an end . Wiping his streaming brow on the maroon velvet of his sleeve , he said to his opponent , " You did n't touch me once , Gaspard . " The arms master grunted . " That 's true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once . You have great skill with the sword . " Removing the cork from the tip of his weapon , D'Arlay added with an air of satisfaction , " On the other hand , I got through your guard quite often . " " Four times , my lord . " " Well , " demanded D'Arlay , dropping on a bench and spreading out his long legs with the feeling of comfort that follows any physical effort , " what do you think of my chance ? " Gaspard did not answer at once . He was rolling down the sleeve of his tunic . Then he reached for his leather jerkin and struggled into it . It was a full minute before he ventured an opinion . " You will have no chance at all , my lord . " D'Arlay was puzzled as well as disturbed . " But why ? " he asked . " What more can you expect of me ? " The arms master shook his head gloomily . " I 've seen Jacques de Lalain in the lists . There has never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he fights with the fury of a gored bull . In addition he has great skill with all weapons . " " With the sword it 's skill only which counts . The answer to his greater strength is in the lightness of the foot . I can keep out of his reach until I see an opening for a thrust of my own . " The man did not seem convinced . " But your legs lose their nimbleness when encased in grevieres and with iron shoes on the feet . " " We 're to fight without armor of any kind . " Gaspard looked his surprise . " Has the Burgundian agreed to that ? It will make a great difference . You 'll have a chance to spit him before112 THE MONEYMANhis greater strength can have any effect . But , " with a return of his doubts , " it will be wise not to depend too much on that . You must fit yourself for a long bout and that will mean much hard work . " " I 'm prepared to do whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head approvingly . " If you are serious , I can promise to make a different man of you . It will mean "  --  Gaspard gave a quick glance to convince himself that the drastic advice he must offer would be accepted in the right spirit  --  " the greatest discomfort for you . You must eat nothing but the foods I select . There must be exercises twice a day and a long run to improve your wind . Our bout today was a short one , my lord , and yet you are still panting and covered with perspiration . When you have followed my advice for a long enough time . you will come through a little dancing lesson such as this without a damp hair on your head . I must be honest with you , my lord . You are soft and short of wind and you have muscles like a chitterling . " " As I said before , Gaspard , I 'm ready to place myself in your hands . " The arms master reached for his cloak and hat . " May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've turned thirty . " " You look younger than that . It 's a late age to begin on the heavy work I must give you . I can say this much for you , my lord , you have n't got yourself a monstrous weasand like most men of your years . " After a critical survey he went on , " ' There 's a little extra fat here and there on your bones which we must get rid of at once . Eat sparingly . Soups and meat only . No bread , no pastry , not more than one drink of wine at each meal . " " A miserable kind of life you are plotting for me , Gaspard . " " Cut a longer life , " ventured the arms master , " than you are like to have if you do n't do everything I say . " l ) ' Arlay had been reduced to a thoroughly unhappy frame of mind . " I thought he would be well impressed , " he said to himself . " Well , I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must forget I have a brain and a heart and remember only that I have muscles to be developed . I must strive to make myself into the kind of honorable knight who thinks only of killing other knights. " 2He was still engaged in these gloomy speculations when another visitor arrived . It proved to be the last person in the world he could have expected on such a day , his brother . The Comte de Burey slouched in THE MONEYMAN 11 ; on flat feet , leaning forward as he walked and peering ahead of him with the anxious pucker of shortsightedness . He had become paunchy and bald and his long face had the sallowness of bad health ; but in spite of all this lie still exerted some small vestige of what had once been a debonair ( - harm . Dropping his wet cloak from his shoulders and allowing it to fall behind him on the floor , he revealed the fact that he was attired in the extreme of fashion . A ruffled tunic fell almost to his knees , his thinningshanks were covered by parti-colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trunks of full-grown trees . He stopped and looked about him , teetering uncertainly . It was clear that he was at least partially drunk . " Ha ! " he said , squinting at his brother . " What have you been trying to do , make yourself a rival of Marco Polo ? You 've been away for six months and I 've been needing you desperately . I heard last night you had condescended to return  --  and here I am , in all this rain , with an ache in my bones as though I had been put on the rack . 7'hut is how badly 1 need to see you ! " He walked farther into the room , laying his feet down with the greatest care and balancing himself with difficulty . " There are times when I suspect the gout has laid its foul hand on me . " " Your sins are catching up with you , Naulty , " said D'Arlay . Then he smiled and extended his hand . " I 'm glad to see you . " " Ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll be glad to see . How could you stay away from her so long ? By'r Lady of Marmoutier , I must have an eye to my health now that you 're back . If I should die , you would strip the shoes off my feet before they were stiff in your haste to get into them . " " A jest in very bad taste , Naulty . And I doubt very much if you 'll leave as much as a pair of shoes , the way things are going with you . " " It 's bad taste to let the whole world know you 're in love with your brother 's wife , my Robin . Oh , I concede it 's partly my fault . You wanted her and I took her away from you . I might have expected , knowing what a determined , unchanging young dog you are , that you would go on mooning after her . But now I confess to a growing distaste for your undying devotion , as I suppose you call it . " He dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I shall perish if you do n't produce a hot posset at once to revive me ? And do you call this feeble pindle of flame a fire ? Is it by mean economies such as this that you keep yourself so affluent , my closefisted brother ? " D'Arlay called to his servant . " Helion ! Mulled wine at once . And then another log for the fire . " 114 THE MONEYMAN " The days of your devotion to Isabeau are over , " asserted Regnault de Burey when a flagon of wine had been brought him and the fire had been stirred up to a hot blaze . " That 's what I 've come to discuss with you . You must marry at once . I may tell you without more ado that I 've found the wife for you . " " Has it occurred to you that I might prefer to find my own wife ? " The Comte glared over the rim of his flagon . " Has it occurred to you that we might have all the family estates taken away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once of paying oil my debts ? " D'Arlay 's mood sobered . " Is it as bad as that , Naulty ? " " Things could n't be worse . They hang over me like a flock of vultures , these bloodsucking leeches from Lombardy . They give me no peace . I can no longer pay the interest on my debts and at the same time keep up any pretense of living like a gentleman . Do you want to see the lands of your ancestors in the hands of filthy moneylenders ? " " No ! " said D'Arlay . " I 'm as concerned about that as you are , Naulty . The debts must be paid in some way . " " Are you in a position to pay them ? " " I 've benefited through my association with Jacques Coeur , but not to that extent . It would take a very rich man to repair the damage you 've done to the family fortunes , brother . " " It comes down to this . You ca n't dandle around fancy free any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife with a large enough fortune to save the lands of I ) e I , urey from going out of the family . " He supped at his wine before adding in a tone of voice faintly apologetic : " There is also the matter of a male heir to succeed and carry on the name . That will he your responsibility also . I 'm not likely to supply the deficiency . Make no mistake , it 's not my fault . I 've cast a dozen laggen-girdsl around the Countryside . " D'Arlay seated himself beside his brother . After several moments of intense and unhappy thought he began to speak . " I 've always known , Naulty , that it would come to this sooner or later , that I would have to marry with an eye to both these considerations . My duty has always been clear to me but I 've put off marrying as I have n't seen anyone I felt I could endure living with . Now it seems I must face the problem . It 's unfortunate from my standpoint that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect I 've fallen in love  --  and with someone with no name and no prospects . In fact , I could n't have made a worse choice , as you would emphatically agree if you knew anything about the lady in question . " ' A reference to illegitimacy . THE MONEYMAN 115The Comte was so taken aback by this piece of news that he stared fixedly at his brother , the whites of his eyes showing ( or what would have been the whites if they had not become a bilious brown ) and his mouth open to display a prominent front tooth . " What Isabeau will think of this , " he said , " will add to my discomfort for longer than I care to contemplate . By'r Lady of Marmoutier , she will take it ill ! " He crossed one leg over the other and groaned with the pain . " But we have no difficultyhere at all . If the wench is as lacking in prospects as you say , no one will want to marry her and you can keep her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . In the first place , she has no idea that I 've fallen in love with her . When I marry someone else  --  and it seems that I must  --  I shall never see her again . " " You would be well rid of one as uncomfortably virtuous as that . " They sat in silence for several moments and then D'Arlay asked , " Who is the lady on whom you 've fixed your eye ? " The Comte answered with cheerful readiness . " A perfect choice , a flawless diamond among women , or at least nearly flawless . Listen to her perfections . A widow , well under thirty , one child only  --  a girl , quite sickly and not likely to survive  --  fair to look upon , lively , and so much property in her own name , mostly in the way of estates in Angouleme , that our debts could be paid off and still there would be enough to muffle up the whole family of De Burey against the winds of adversity . " " Who is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furtive air as he pronouncedthe name . " Clothilde de Trepant , widow of the Sire de Trepant who was killed in a lance-running at Bordeaux some six months back . He was killed , in fact , just as you began your endless travels and I 've been watching for you ever since . " Satisfied that D'Arlay had never heard of the lady who might become his wife , the Comte proceeded to an explanation . " There is one small circumstance which will bear telling . A few months after the sire 's death , her page , standing behind her chair with company in the room , was observed to reach down and give her a sly pinch . It was assumed from this that she had been allowing the boy certainprivileges . " In a tone of voice which seemed to say , " If I must marry for wealth does anything matter ? " D'Arlay asked , " What of her looks ? " " Ha ! " cried his brother . " There we are on the firmest ground . She has hair which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a pert nose , and a figure that is most pleasantly slender . I can promise you this : by day , THE MONEYMAN 117cold stare my wife reserves for me alone . And now this cousin is coming . Not a full cousin , mind you . Some little chit , a bastard no less of my wife 's rampaging bull of an Uncle Gilles . Why is this child being brought into my household ? " D'Arlay understood the whole story now . He walked over to a corner where clothes were hanging on pegs and took down a heavy cloak . He was thinking : " He 's going too far . I wo n't permit it ! " " When I asked Isabeau the reason , she said the child was in need of a home . Ha , no doubt ! But Uncle Gilles has his get scattered all over Berri , and all of them are in need of homes . Why this sudden solicitude over one of them ? You know as well as I do that this wife of " He stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general direction of the fire . " I almost said this wife of ours . That will show you how I feel about the way you patter after her and jump at her beck . Well , this wife of mine is a beautiful woman , as you will agree , a woman of intelligence and charm . We both admire her very much . But we both know that her heart is not the kind to swell up suddenly to the bursting point over the plight of a distant connection , one she has never seen , moreover . Why is she so concerned over this ill-begotten brat ? " Another phase of the matter , one which seemed to cause him the most acute annoyance , occurred to the Comte . " If my house is to be filled with sniveling children , why is none of the money given to me ? " " Because , no doubt , they realize that giving money to you would be as sensible as feeding gold pieces to the fish in the Seine . " The head of the family continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason if they would give me a share of the fruits of this  --  this backstairsconspiracy , this underhanded foisting of bastards on me . " D'Arlay started to walk in the direction of the stairs . He was so filled with resentment that he found it hard to speak . " Come ! I 'm going with you ! We must see about this at once ! " COEUR , who could be cheerful in most circumstances , looked about himas they mounted their horses and said , " The storm will surely moderate ; i before we get there . " Chapter X116 THE MONEYMANshe will amuse you with her wit ; by night , she will battle it out with you in the briskest and sweetest of dalliance . " Regnault de Burey nodded his head like a lawyer at his summing up . " I have looked over the field with a thoroughness bred of desperation . This one is the pick . She will be both wife and mistress , she will be like a beautifully embroidered purse which will never empty no matter how often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possess the necessary property , she has the most virtues and the fewest faults . My advice to you , brother , is this : take her at once . " " You will allow mc , I trust , to  --  to look about me first ? " " There 's no time to waste . " The Comte went on in a grumbling tone . " Touching this matter , I put little trust in you . There was the case of the Lady Alys de Guiraut a few weeks ago . Oh , I 've heard all about it . You were riding north with the household of the Comte . The daughter , a pretty chick , was inclined to like you  --  for reasons which I fail to understand . And what did you do ? You took sides against her with some halfwildcreature , some greasy hobgoblin ; and now the Lady Alys ca n't think of you without wishing the wind would set in another direction . " He began to enumerate the holdings of the Comte de Guiraut . " A tract of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sixteen sweet vineyardsin the very heart of the wine country . Three chateaux , one on the Loire . A house in Paris . A castle on the Garonne large enough to hold an army . And you , my wise brother , offended her on behalf of this verminoustrollop with the head of a turnip " D'Arlay said shortly , " I promise to waste no time in reaching a deci-sion . " The Conne got slowly to his feet . He was on the point of leaving but then changed his mind and turned back . " Have you been sending money to Isabeau ? " he demanded . " No . I 've neither seen nor been in communication with her for six months . " " Then where does the gold come from which has been in my house for the last two days ? The servants have been paid . Isabeau , pretty creature , has been buying materials for dresses . Can it have anything to do with Jaquet the Fox paying her visits ? " D'Arlay sprang to his feet . A preposterous notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but still completely unwelcome on second consideration . " Are you telling me that Jacques Coeur has been seeing Isabeau ? " " Twice in the last few days . Whispering together like a pair of conspirators . When I ask her what it 's all about , she just stares at me  --  that118 THE MONEYMAN " It will become worse ! " declared Nicolas tartly . " The Grant Oberie is washed out . A drunken fuller was drowned this morning in a pool near Saint-Gervais . " " In spite of that we must be on our way . " They rode out with their horses ' hoofs splashing loudly in the water which swept down the street . Valerie was beside the Moneyman while Nicolas , grumbling audibly , brought up the rear . It became evident at once that the servant 's estimate had been the correct one . The rain was coming down with all the fury and volume of that downpour which covered the earth after forty days and forty nights . They kept their heads down and made no attempt to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took advantage of the chance to ask , " What is she like , my lord Coeur ? " The Moneyman ruminated for a moment . " The Comtesse is very lovely , " he said . " She has intelligence and charm , and a very great deal of determination . How you will find her when she first gets up in the morning , or if you stumble on her when her hair is down , I ca n't say . " The Hotel de Burey , which they reached in due course , towered high above the street . The carved inscription and the family arms on the arched masonry shield over the postern gate were proof of the antiquity of the building as well as of the importance of the family , but nothing could offset the impression of dilapidation the house created . The copper gutters under the roof were full of holes and the water dripped from them in dreary persistence . The pointed sentinel towers , bulging out on each corner , had been so long in disrepair that they seemed ready to tumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign of habitation was a smudge of smoke from one chimney which the wind pounced upon and forced downward in wisps about the eaves and windows . But to Valerie it was most grand and impressive . " It must be a very great family , my lord , " she said , in a far from happy tone . Coeur helped her down from her horse . " An old family , " he whispered . " But because of the Comte 's fondness for dicing and women , and his father before him whose fancy ran to lawsuits , they are as poor today as a beggar 's cloak . My friend D'Arlay , though the younger brother , is in better case than the Comte . " The Comtesse met them at the head of the stairs . " My lord Coeur ! " she cried . " I had given up all hope that you would come on such a day . " She might have given up hope but that had not prevented her from being well prepared for the unexpected . Her flowing kirtle was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelminglyTHE MONEYMAN 119 becoming . Her sleeves , puffed generously at shoulder and elbow , were laced with straps of gold thread . Contrary to custom she wore nothing on her head . There was design in this , undoubtedly , for her hair had a crisp natural wave . Her fine wide brow showed no trace of the passage of the years ; her eyes were as warmly responsive as a girl 's ; her generouslyexposed neck and shoulders were white and enticing . Following nervously in the rear of her escort , Valerie looked at the Comtesse and thought , " She must be the loveliest woman in the world , lovelier eventhan Agnes Sorel . " Frightened though she was , the girl noticed that the kerchief of this beautiful lady was tucked under her waist and wondered if this was the custom at court . She saw also that there were no rings on the fingers of the Comtesse but that she wore one on a chain abouther neck . " She thinks her hands look better without them , " thought Valerie , " but she wears that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person who gave it to her . " " You are drenched , " said the Comtesse to Coeur , solicitously . She turned and looked at Valerie . " And this is the girl ? " " Yes , this is Mademoiselle Maret . " The Comtesse nodded . " You are welcome , my child . " The girl dropped a rather forlorn curtsy . She was feeling more awe with her surroundings each moment and in addition was acutely conscious of the condition to which the storm had reduced her . Rivulets of water were trickling down her cheeks and her hair was hanging in damp wisps . The Comtesse looked her over critically and indulged in a puzzled shake of the head . " Well , " she said , " there must be a reason for all this . Have I been told everything ? The resemblance eludes me , my lord Coeur . " " Under better conditions it 's unmistakable . " " Then I shall have to wait . " Valerie thought , " They talk about me as though I were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn ? " She was beginning to have doubts . " I think she 's hard in spite of her beauty . She is n't going to like me at all . " The Comtesse continued to study her new charge . " Collect your wits , my child , " she said .
