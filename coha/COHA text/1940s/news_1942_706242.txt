txt While the fire-ravaged liner Normandie lay grotesquely on her side in her West Forty-eighth Street slip yesterday , naval authorities remained non-committal on the one question everybody was asking : Can she be salvaged ? Although there , was no direct comment from Rear Admiral Adolphus R. Andrews , commandant of the Third Naval District , or any of his aides , it was established that a special board of technical experts would be assembled as soon as possible to study the salvage problem . The water at Pier 88 is normally 42 feet deep at mean low water . The ship drew 36 feet 7 inches . The work of the proposed technical board seemed certain to be complicated and delayed by the enormous Size-83,423 tons ? of the craft and the depth to which she might sink in mud and silt . The Normandie , recently renamed the U. S. S. Lafayette , keeled over at 2:35 A. M. , after flames had raged on , three upper decks all Monday afternoon . The disaster left her funnels a matter of inches above the ice-clogged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four-bladed propellers jutted weirdly above the surface . 30,000 Visit the Scene During the day 30,000 men , women and children came to see the fallen giant , her great flank swelling out of the partly frozen slip . Meanwhile , most of the 257 persons known to have been treated for injuries resulting from the blaze were out danger , although fifty remained in hospitals . One workman died of injuries Monday evening . With the fire itself finally dismissed during the day by District Attorney Frank S. Hogan as due to " carelessness , " not sabotage , speculation as to salvage remained paramount in the minds of both official and unofficial observers . There was general agreement that if such a vast project was to be undertaken , the Merritt-Chapman &; Scott Corporation of 17 Battery Place would Rave a hand in it . Merritt-Chapman , as the company is generally known , has for years been the first name in salvage in this area . In 1918 its divers helped refloat and make ready for refitting within eight months the 10,230-ton liner St. Paul , which turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that year . But at the company 's office yesterday Captain W. N. Davis , in charge of salvage , said he would not speak to the press " under any conditions . " A small Merritt-Chapman craft was among those busy in the slip Monday during the fight to keep the tilting liner upright . In the case of the St. Paul , divers went to work the day after the mishap and early in August had built a coffer dam about her . In effect , the dam surrounded the hulk with a wall of clay-packed piles from which the water was pumped so that workers had complete access to the craft on her side . With all water drained and pumped from the ship herself , and all holes sealed , it was possible to refloat her on her side within the borders of the darn , then right her by derrick pressure on chains affixed during the " dry " period within the dam . The St. Paul was raised on Sept. 27 , a day more than five months after the sinking , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Conceivably-the coffer-dam technique could be used on the Normandie , too . But the French vessel is twice as long as the St. Paul , nearly twice as broad and nearly eight times as heavy . Moreover , construction of a coffer-dam would almost certainly mean partial demolition of Pier 88 and possibly even of the Cunard pier adjoining upstream . The only other vessel that ship men could remember ? having toppled over at a local berth was the old White Star liner Germanic , which came to grief because of the weight of ice on her superstructure shortly before World War I. She survived to sail until 1931 , when she went aground near the Hors . Lighthouse in the Sea of Marmora and was broken up , despite salvage efforts . The importance of speed in any salvage operation was obvious . Not only will each day place the ship deeper in the mud but the serious effect of the brackish water of the North River on the vital machinery and wiring of the Normandie will increase with time . The problem of the overturned vessel is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from that of sunken or stranded ships . But there can be no doubt that the Normandie , through her own sheer size and because of the urgency that she be made available to the government for the purposes for which she was converted , poses the greatest problem of the type ever to confront the men who reclaim ships . In this connection , there was a maze of theories as to how the job might be done . There was also a wealth of rumors as to just why the vessel had keeled over . One report had it that plates removed on the starboard side to admit water to equalize the burden of the water poured in by firemen from the port side had actually made things worse . Admiral Andrews had said Monday evening , after a scuttling plan had been discarded , that a hole was cut instead in the ship 's starboard side and water poured in in the hope of counterbalancing the list to port . But was plain from a look at the whale-like starboard flank and bottom of the ship yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole had been cut , it was a very small one . District Attorney Hogan 's statement on the results of his inquiry named the man who had wielded the torch from which the fatal sparks flew . He is Clement Derrick of 925 Union Street , Brooklyn . A native of the United States , he is employed by the Robins Dry Dock and Repair Company . In his deposition , Derrick admitted using the torch with his body actually touching the stacked burlapcovered bales of life preservers where the flames started , the prosecutor asserted . Hogan Makes Statement Mr. Hogan said : " My office has conducted an intensive.investigation of the fire on the Normandie . Approximately seventy witnesses have been examined . They were questioned by twenty assistant district attorneys on the pier , at six hospitals and in my office until 5 o'clock this ( Tuesday ) morning . " Witnesses are in substantial agreement as to the cause of the fire . An acetylene torch was being used to cut through four steel stanchions in the main salon onli the promenade deck . Three had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ' a large number of burlap-covered bales , said to contain kapok-filled life- ! preservers . " Alphonsus Gately , who was employed by the Robins Dry Dock and Repair Company and who was in charge of the operation , directed the removal of these bales . The testimony is that they were moved only two or three feet . Clement ' Derrick of 925 Union Street , Brooklyn , who operated the burning torch , stated that his body , , as he worked , touched the pile ' of bales . " Gately said there were two pails of water and a hose within a few feet of the torch ; the usual metal sheet and asbestos boards used in connection with a cutting operation were present . " The stanchion had not been completely cut when the fire started . Flames were seen to spread from bale to bale with great rapidity . Twenty to twenty-five workmen attempted to stamp out the flames . The smoke and fire forced them from the salon . Gately backed up to the port deck with the inactive fire hose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a window at the burning bales . He testified that the pressure was such that the stream carried only about ten feet . " The salient fact developed is that a flame , causing sparks to fly , was used within two or three feet of hundreds of bales of inflammable material . " There is no evidence of sabotage . Carelessness has served the enemy with equal effectiveness . " The investigation is continuing . " Supplementing the statement , the prosecutor said only two witnesses had spoken of sabotage , and then only " vaguely . " One was quoted as having heard , a few days before the fire , ' ' This liner will never leave port . " Police Commissioner Valentine , remarking that the explanation of the fire as accidental had been given officially Monday night , added : " Detectives are still investigating and verifying . " Despite these official reports here at the scene , in Berlin the enemy seemed to be taking credit for the fire . The Berlin radio in an English broadcast , heard last night by the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former French liner Normandie was of incendiary origin and blasted the plans for transforming the liner into an aircraft carrier . " Fire Commissioner Patrick Walsh announced that , after an inquiry , he had determined there was " no appreciable delay " between the outbreak of the fire and the summoning of his men . " The fire traveled very rapidly , " he said , in the presence of Fire Marshal Thomas Brophy , " and we were called as soon as we could have expected to be . " A strip of Twelfth Avenue between Forty-eighth and Fiftieth Streets , between the stringpiece and the east curb , was roped off yesterday and Negro troops with rifles enforced the implication of the barriers . But the sad spectacle of the stricken Normandie remained visible to the thousands who crowded the sidewalk or drove by on the West Side Highway at speeds plainly dedicated to sightseeing , not rapid transit . Presents Pitiful Sight From Fiftieth Street , framed by I the dark structure of the elevated highway , the Normandie presented a pitiful sight to any one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The huge funnels had toppled till only the width of a hand or two separated their lower rims from the murky ice . Jutting beyond the first funnel was the foremast , intact save for the upper yard , or crosspiece . There was at least a thirty-foot gap between the bulbed tip of the mast and the south side of the big Cunard pier to the north . Thus the former , pride of the French Line was spared the ignominy of crashing her mast against the stolid wall of her rival ; but it was a good thing the city 's super-piers , especially built in 1935 , had 400 feet of water between them . The margin was none too big . A ship 's derrick , a little forward , slanted downward in front of the mast . The curving bridge was badly fire-scarred , but its cup-like starboard tip protruded like an aloof lookout along the uprearing side of the vessel . From a more southerly vantage , the tremendous naked sweep of the upturned side awed the spectator . The flaring sweep to the unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 1,000 feet beyond , and the now pathetically useless propellers , stark and ugly out of water , were incredible memorials to the devastation caused by a " few sparks .
