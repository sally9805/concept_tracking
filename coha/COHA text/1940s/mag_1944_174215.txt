Franz Werfel is a Jew who writes so much like a Christian ( Embezzled Heaven , The Song of Bernadette ) that he has more than once had to deny that he is a convert . In Between Heaven &; Earth ( Philosophical Library , $3 ) , published last week , Czech Author Werfel ( now living in California ) for the first time discusses his deep religious faith . <P> Although he believes that Christ 's teaching " towers star-high , " and that the world " can be spiritually healed only if it finds its way back to true Christianity , " Werfel will always remain a Jew : " Israel is more than a nation ; it is an historical and biological order . . . into which . . . one enters by birth , never to be released until the last day but one . A Jew who steps up to the baptismal font . . . deserts . . . from the side of the weak and the persecuted . . . from Israel 's deepest origins , from Abraham , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Himself , since he arbitrarily interrupts his historical suffering - the penance for rejecting the Messiah . " <P> Like Jeremiah warning against strange gods , Author Werfel warns modern man of the perils of materialism . This evil , he declares , is responsible both for the U.S. conception of the state as an insurance company , and for the German belief in National Socialism . Without faith in God , man seeks security elsewhere . <P> Author Werfel 's personal credo : everything in the universe has meaning . The world is " a creation of spirit and love , " and man can realize God 's existence without being able to understand His Being , " just as one might touch a mountain without being able to embrace it .
