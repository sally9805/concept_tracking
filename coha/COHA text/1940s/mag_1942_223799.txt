The Maharani of Kolhapur consulted with her astrologers and learned that the proper time for the rites was indubitably the 28th of September . The Government of India was informed of this , and agreed , and said so be it . But the father and mother of little Pratap Singh Rao Bhonsle had been studying things out with their own soothsayers , and these cried that the 28th of September was a calamitous choice for at least four different astrological reasons , and very quickly in the soothsaying circles of Kolhapur things were at sixes &; sevens .
