END OF MAY A Story JEAN BYERS o urstnE the real estate office Clyde folded the thick receipt of deed and placed it carefully in the inside pocket of his coat . The sun was low , and he pulled his hat brim over his eyes as he walked slowly toward the side street where the truck was parked . He sat behind the wheel , flipping the keys , letting them slide on the ring . Across the street the five-thirty bus was just coming in from the beach . Clyde watched three boys alight . They carried wet swimming trunks , and they shoved each other and laughed as they disappeared into the creamery on the corner . He sighed enviously . A boy whizzed by on skates , slapping the fender of the truck as he passed . A worn jalopy , covered with yellow signs , bucked and snorted up the street . Clyde glanced at the driver , noting the purple sweater with the large , yellow block letters , and turned his attention to the keys again . Everywhere he looked he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , only three years out of high school , but older now , serious and dependable , with a lot of responsibilities . Three years , he thought . It seemed more like ten . Three years ago he 'd cared only about basketball and track and coming over here to the beach once in a while . He 'd been happily repeating his junior year at high school with no more responsibilities than trying to pass English and keeping the kitchen wood-box full at home and helping a little with the orchard . Then everything had piled up and come down on him like a landslide . The war . That was enough right there . Then coming home just before his father died and taking care of the funeral because his mother had seemed so helpless . And today , spending the whole afternoon with the real estate agent . It was n't just selling the orchard . He did n't care anything about the orchard , except maybe the blossoms and the smell of the apples , but it was all the business of going through the deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long now it made him feel old . And here it was almost the end of May , and on the first of June he 'd start working in a bank . He looked at his round face in the rearview mirror . The forehead was creased in a deep frown and his mouth was set in a line . No wonder , he thought . Everything ganged up on me . He was Mr. Bartley now . " We think everything is in order , Mr. Bartley , " the agent had said . " Thank you , Mr. Bartley . " He started the truck and drove down Beach Street toward the water . He 'd have a look at the ocean , anyway , before he went home , and watch it turn dark after the sunset . T HE roller coaster had just started up when he got there . Through its tall framework he could see bits of smooth water , dark blue-green under the fading light . He watched the drop and climb and curve and the swift plunge when the row of scats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racket died away and he grinned , remembering the old terror and thrill of the ride . Boy , he thought , the fun I used to have on that thing . It was kid stuff , maybe , but that was the feeling he 'd wanted when he got out of the Army  --  to come home to a time rather than to a place , the time when he was little and there had been only food and sleep and fun to think about . Just for a while , of course . He did n't expect it to last forever , but he 'd never got that feeling at all , the way things had been . The lights had come on in the casino now , and Clyde could hear the wheezy music of the merry-go-round . He still liked the sound of it , although he 'd never spent much time there . He had always liked playing on the beach and building fires at night out of dry , salty driftwood . He remembered how his father had told him to take a candle along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd always built good fires because of the candle . He could feel it in his hands now the smooth wax and the sand under his nails and the rocks grating as he put them around . The roller coaster started up again . It climbed , shrieked around the big curve , raced down and up . Clyde jumped out of the truck and started across to the drugstore under the Seaside Apartments . He 'd phone and tell his mother he was going to be late . He 'd play around for a while , just looking , and next month some time he 'd come back and spend a whole day . He ran back and threw his hat on the front seat and then took off his coat and tie . He felt better . If it got cold , all the more reason for building a little fire down in the cove . He was smiling when he came out of the phone booth . That was one thing about being older , he thought . You could call up and say you were going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . The druggist was back in the prescription room and Clyde watched the fat woman in green slacks at the counter and the little girl at the magazine rack . They both looked funny to him , and he thought it was a good sign . When he was having a good time by himself everything looked either nice or funny . The woman spreadout and billowed over the stool and kept scraping her spoon around the inside of her dish and smacking her Iips . The little girl was so tough looking he was surprised to see her sidle hesitantly up to the woman . " Aunt Gladys , " she said . " Can I have a magazine ? " She held the magazine tightly and stayed several feet away from the counter . The woman turned suddenly and looked down at the girl . " I thought I told you to go over to the casino and play , " she said sharply . " No , you ca n't have it . Go put it back . " The girl sulked back to the magazines : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gladys ? " she asked . " I do n't know yet , " said the woman . She reached into an enormous white purse as the druggist came out to the counter . " There 'll be twenty cents extra , Miss Taylor , " said the druggist . " The little girl got a milk-shake this afternoon . " Clyde saw the girl send a long , bitter look of hatred toward the druggist , throw the magazine at the rack , and dart out the door . T HE woman slid off the stool . Her eyes were narrowed and her heavy chin shook as she snapped her head toward the door and back to the druggist . " I told you not to charge stuff for that kid , " she yelled . " My God , who does she think she is , going around charging stuff to me ? That 's the second time , and now you listen here . " She slapped her money down on the counter and held her thick hand over it . " This is the last time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's your tough luck . Charging it , for the God 's sake . " " OK , Miss Taylor , " said the druggist . The woman snatched up her change and walked heavily past Clyde . " I do n't see what 's so damned funny , " she said . The door banged and Clyde laughed out loud . The druggist laughed with him . It felt good , thought Clyde , to be laughing at a woman like that . It put him on the little girl 's side . This was the right idea , staying over here . " Takes all kinds , " the druggist was saying . " Yeah , " laughed Clyde . " Say , " he asked , " you got any candies ? " The man was gone for a while and returned with a dusty box of long pink tapers . " That all you got ? " " That 's all . " Clyde brought out his knife , cut a candle in half , and put the knife and the two pieces in his pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up at the druggist 's face he wanted to laugh again . I guess I 'm one of the kinds , he thought . Outside he stopped to consider what he should do first . Go down to the cove and build a fire ? No , he 'd start at this end of the beach and walk up , looking at the amusements a while first , and then build a fire . Later on some time he 'd come back and spend a whole day . He took the footbridge across the lagoon where the rowboats were anchored and got down to the beach . It was a nice time of evening now , just light enough to tell that the water was green . The biggest waves were n't any more than three feet high . They made a little white fringe on the edge of the ocean and a soft , playful sound . Clyde stopped and breathed deeply . Why had n't he thought before about coming down here ? This was the right place . He began to get the feeling he 'd wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the dry sand so they 'd squeak . He zigzagged between piles of kelp , jumping on the balls to hear them pop , remembering that dry ones banged like firecrackers if you threw them on a fire . He found a long piece of kelp and broke off the round bulb at the end and the shiny brown leaves , scraping the ends free of sand to use it for a jump rope . He used to pretend he was a fighter when he did this , a fighter in training . He jumped furiously on the wet sand till the kelp cracked . Then he threw it as far as he could into the water . A wave broke and whispered up toward him , and he backed away until one frothy scallop touched the toes of his shoes . " Go on back , " he said . " Beat it . " He was nuts , he thought , talking out loud like that . Just the same , it felt good . He let the puddles form around his shoes for a moment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could see the lights from the wharf sliding on the water . By the time he got to the cove the moon would be up . He smiled to himself . This was just the way he used to feel . s UDDENLY everything seemed all right . The war was a long time ago . It had never happened here . And the funeral . He did n't even mind the funeral , thinking about it now . Death seemed natural wearing the tired face of his dad ? and smelling of freesias and carnations . And all that long ceremony was nice , the undertaking parlor with the man singing " Beautiful Isle of Somewhere , " and the solemn ride to the cemetery and back . That was the way death should be . And he was glad they were selling the apple orchard and moving into town . He did n't want to be a farmer , and he 'd just as soon work in a bank as anywhere else . What he 'd really like would be singing with a band , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get started . The bank would be fine . Only that would be the first of June . He did n't have to worry about that yet . He sat there a long time , thinking how crazy he 'd been to feel old when here he was getting the same old kick out of the beach . It was just being in there with the agent and watching the kids on the street that had given him that feeling . He got up and walked along by the water where the sand was hard . He picked up a shell , wiped it clean , and felt its smooth inner surface and fluted edge . Shells were pretty . In the shed at home there was a big collection of nice ones he 'd found around here . He held the shell in his hand for a while before he threw it into the water . A flight of steps led to the boardwalk here , and when he went up he noticed how few people there were . But it was still May , and the crowds did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad because he did n't want a crowd now . He wished he could have the whole thing to himself . There were only two little girls and a lady on the merry-go-round . The little girls looked excited and shouted to each other over the blare of " Alexander 's Ragtime Band , " and the lady was smiling . Clyde watched until the ride was finished and the lady lifted the girls down . It all looked good . The horses were clean and bright as if they 'd been freshly painted , and the attendant wore a white uniform . The girls begged for another ride . The attendant lifted them up again , and the lady pulled at the saddle straps to see that they were buckled tightly . Clyde moved on to the Dodgem cars . The noisy cars whirled and bumped and the drivers knocked into each other and shouted . Clyde watched the boys driving crazily and remembered himself , laughing and frightened at his first ride . He could hear the dance band playing now , and he went around to the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked to dance , but he did n't want to tonight . That was n't the kind of a time he wanted . He decided to wait there to see what the singer was like . Dancing sure looked funny , he thought , when you were n't doing it . He felt something brush by in the narrow space between him and the windows . He moved and saw the little girl from the drugstore . She was bent over , her nose almost on the walk , moving slowly toward the street . In a moment she returned , pushing herself between Clyde and the windows again . " Hey , " he said as he stepped hack . " What is this ? " " I lost something , " she said . Her voice was tragic , but he caught her quick glance at him before she bent her head . He laughed softly . That gag . " How much did you lose ? " he asked . " A nickel or a dime ? " " A dime , " she said , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull brown hair bushed out around thin shoulders . Her mouth was painted so that the curves of the upper lip reached almost to her nostrils , and the rest of her face was sunburned and peeling . She wore a dirty white sweater and a short red cotton skirt . She backed away from him , locking her arms behind her and clutching her sharp elbows . He had n't really looked at her before , except to notice that she was too tough looking . Now he saw that she was a kid , ten or eleven maybe , trying to act tough . " Gee , " said Clyde , " that 's hard luck : Just enough to buy a hot dog . " " Yeah , " said the girl , tragic again , " it was going to be my dinner . " She bent dawn intently . " I think it went down the crack between the boards . " Clyde laughed again . Kids ' dimes on the boardwalk always went through the cracks . " Look , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog myself . I 'm going to stay here and listen to the band . You go get ' em and bring ' em back , and if you are n't here in five minutes , I 'll call the cops . " Her weak smile made the lipstick spread out crazily as she took the dimes . " With mustard ? " she asked . " Yeah , with mustard . " He looked back at the dancers . Maybe the kid would come back , maybe she would n't . Anyway , the gag had worked for her . He 'd never seen it work before . T HE band leader leaned into the microphone and a soft , buttery tenor floated out over the boardwalk . The guy could sing , thought Clyde . Sounded good . The dancers collected in a little knot around the orchestra , and the singer nodded and smiled to them . The hall was filling now , and the dancing looked better . Still , he did n't want to go in there . He lit a cigarette and decided to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner and stopped , panting , in front of him . " Here , " she said , holding out a hot dog to him . " Well , " said Clyde . " Well . Thanks . " Now that she was here he realized he had n't expected her to come back . " What 's your name , kid ? " " Lola . " " Well thanks a lot , Lola . " " It was no trouble at all , " she said , and crammed her mouth full . With her jaws working hard she pointed to the windows . " My mother 's in there , " she said . " Is she ? " " Yeah . Gee , she 's pretty . I bet she 's the prettiest one in there . " " Sure , " said Clyde . " She looks just like Ginger Rogers . " Clyde laughed . " They all look like Ginger Rogers . " " No , but my mother really does . Her boy friend says so . " " Well . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father 's in Los Angeles . " " Oh . " He watched her devouring the last of the hot dog and thought she looked better with mustard on her mouth . She looked like any little kid now , a little homelier , skinnier than most . " Does your mother know you 're out here ? " he asked . " Oh no . I do n't usually live with my mother . Mostly I stay over there at the Seaside with Aunt Gladys . " " Gosh , " said Clyde . " You 've got a complicated life . " " Who do you live with ? " asked Lola . " My mother . " " Gee , do you ? Is she pretty ? " " No , not very . " " Not even prettier than Aunt Gladys ? " " Oh , sure , prettier than that . By the way , you better not charge milk-shakes at the drugstore any more . " Lola looked up at him with pale , frightened eyes . " Did she act sore ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Plenty . " " She 's always sore at me about something . She says my mother do n't give her enough money for me . I betcha she keeps it herself . I bet my mother sends plenty of money for me . " " Sure she does , " said Clyde . " Aunt Gladys just wants me to play over here all the time . I get sick of playin ' over here . " " Keep still now , " said Clyde . " I want to listen to the singer . " The girl hopped and wriggled to the music , watching Clyde 's face as he listened . " You know what I 'm going to be ? " she whispered . " No . " " A dancer . I take lessons all the time . Every day . " " Do you like to dance ? " she asked . " Sure , " said Clyde . He was watching the band leader bow and smile and pick up his baton . " Only  --  I like to sing better . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought you probably were something already . " " No , " he said . " I 'm not anything just now . " " That 's all right , " she assured him quickly . " It do n't make any difference . " She waited for an answer , studying him intently . " Gee , " she said at last , " we 're havin ' fun , are n't we  --  talkin ' ? Are n't we ? " " Sure , " said Clyde , and felt suddenly that it was n't true . Something had happened . He moved restlessly . " Look , kid , " he said . " It 's pretty late . Should n't you be home in bed ? " " This is n't late , " she said . " Well , it 's late for me . " He moved toward the main walk . " You better go on home , Lola . So long . " HE ran up beside him . " Please let me come with you . Just as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him solemnly . " No , " he said . " I 'm not going down there now . " " Please , " she said quietly . " Honest , I wo n't ask for anything . " " No , " said Clyde . He did n't want to look at her . " Why do n't you go play with some kids if you are n't going home ? " " I do n't like other kids . I do n't know any . Let me just walk down there with you . " Clyde looked down at her . It was his fault , somehow , he thought . He should n't have started talking to her . " Oh , come on , " he said . " I 'll buy you another hot dog and you can eat it on the way home . " She waited by his side at the hot dog stand , and he could see her eyes blinking , not wavering from his face . He stuffed two paper napkins in his pocket , gave her one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked in silence to the steps . " You stay here now , " he said . " I 'm going down to build a fire . So long , Lola . " She stood there , not smiling , staring at him . She bit the stubby red nails of one hand and held the hot dog tightly at her side . Clyde turned and walked quickly down the stairs . Jeez , he thought , the poor kid . He wished she had n't come along . He did n't want to be feeling sorry about anything tonight . She 'd been funny at first , and then all of a sudden she was n't funny . He walked down close to the water . The waves were a little higher now , and the deep water was black . The wharf lights went down into the broader reflection of the moonlight , and he watched the reflection dip and slide . Up toward the cove where the driftwood was , he 'd build a little fire and sit there a while listening to the waves and then go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Swim and lie in the sun and spend money on every concession and bring his own food to eat by the fire . After he had collected a little dry driftwood from near the base of the cliff , he hunted for the rocks . Medium sized , flat ones , he wanted . He dug down to the hard sand and stuck the piece of candle in , covering it half the way up . He put the rocks around close so the tops were higher than the candle flame . Then he fed in the paper napkins and some shavings and little pieces . It was just the way he used to do it . The fire was small and weak at first , hardly more than the candle flame , and he knelt down , shielding and feeding it . He sang softly , wondering how it would feel to be a regular singer with a band . At least he 'd know the words to new songs . Now he could remember only the old ones  --  last year 's , and before that . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when he lookedup , the girl was there . It did n't seem to surprise him very much . She came up hesitantly , peering at him . " Do n't be sore at me , " she said . " I 'm not sore at you , Lola . " " Can I sit down ? " " Sure . " " Gee , " she said after a while . " Gee , this is the most fun I ever had . " She still held the hot dog , uneaten , in her hand . " Put that on the edge of the big rock there , " said Clyde . " It 'll get warm . " She reached over and placed it on the rock and sat back , clasping her hands around her knees . " Where do you live ? " asked Lola . " I live right here , " Clyde said . " Now listen , Lola . You can stay for a while if you do n't talk . I do n't want to talk . " " OK , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sang good . " " Maybe . " He built up the fire and then leaned back on his elbows . " Can I ask you one thing ? " " All right . One thing . " " Were you really going to call the cops if I did n't come back ? " " I do n't even know any cops . Do n't know what they look like . " They sat a long while in silence before he started to hum , trying to sound like the singer in the dance hall . He sang half-remembered songs with a single phrase of the words repeated over and over , one melody trailing off into another . " Is it all right if I dance ? " Lola whispered . Clyde nodded . She took off her shoes and socks and he watched her run down to the hard sand . She started to jump and turn with awkward , jerky motions , her arms reaching and fluttering in time to the music . Clyde thought she looked like a gawky bird trying to fly . He wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stomach and sang louder , facing the cliff . When he looked around he saw her standing as if she were frozen , her arms out , her head tilted . " Go ahead , " he called . " You 're doing swell . " He started singing again , and then the high , shrill sound came . " Lola ! " It seemed to come from the direction of the water at first . Clyde sat up and listened . " Lola ! " The scream came again from under the wharf . I oILA ran up to the fire . She was shaking , and in the dim light he saw her eyes wide and frightened . " It 's Aunt Gladys , " she said . " I think she 's sore and I got to go quick . " She searched frantically for her shoes and socks , and then ran without them . " I 'm coming , Aunt Gladys , " she called . " My God ! So here you are . When I do n't want you you 're always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to run my legs off . " Clyde recognized the voice . He pictured the narrowed eyes and the heavy , quivering chin . " Your mother gets the sudden idea she wants to see you and comes up to my place , and when you are n't there , she starts in on me . My God , am I supposed to keep track of you every minute ? " " I did n't know you wanted me , Aunt Gladys . Honest I did n't . " Clyde saw the woman reach out and yank Lola 's shoulder , and he heard the girl 's whimper . " Do n't start that whining . If it was n't for the guy in the hot dog stand tellin ' mewhere you went , I 'd be yellin ' my lungs out all night . What in the hell are you doin ' down here anyway ? And where are your shoes and socks ? " " Back there by the fire . " They came toward the fire , Lola wrenching free and darting up to search in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , " the woman sneered . " Ai n't this sweet . I must say , you take after your mother , but you 're sure startin ' in early . " She stood mountainous and scornful above Clyde . " You , " she spat . " Pickin ' up a kid that age . I read about guys like you in the papers , but I never thought I 'd live to see one . " Clyde felt the blood creep slowly up his face , burning him . He felt sick and stared at the woman without speaking . " He 's nice , Aunt Gladys , " cried Lola desperately . " Honest he is . He bought me hot dogs and let me talk to him and let me stay here , and he 's nice ! " " You little fool , " said the woman . She yanked Lola to her feet . " Honest , " Lola cried again , " he 's swell , Aunt Gladys , he 's ? " The woman gave Lola a sharp slap that made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of talk , " she said . " Do n't , " said Clyde . " Do n't . Leave her alone . " " You ! " She came close to him . " You ai n't fit to talk to . Pickin ' up that kid . " " Do n't keep saying that , " said Clyde . " I swear to God I did n't  --  we just ? " His mouth went dry as he heard the woman 's short laugh . " I got a pretty good idea what you had in mind , " she sneered . " You 'd ought to be lynched , that 's what . A kid that age ! " She turned , jerking the girl beside her and walked away from the fire . Clyde could hear Lola 's crying and the woman 's voice recede into the sound of the waves . He fought by closing his eyes and clenching his teeth for a moment . Then he rolled over on his stomach and buried his face in his arms . When he heard the nearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the deserted beach . The casino was dark and quiet . He did not want to look at it now , and yet he knew he would not come back again .
