The Herter Committee returned with a healthy and wholehearted respect for Europe 's Reds . The committeemen had seen them at work . Ohio 's Thomas Jenkins , once a rabid isolationist , had seen Communism 's hard Yugoslav face at Trieste . Considerably shaken , Jenkins wrote : " This terrorism is an example of the methods which Communists will employ to extend their doctrines . " <P> Europe 's greatest danger lay in the people 's complacency , they thought . They found Europeans less disturbed than Americans about Communism . <P> Said South Carolina 's big James Richards : " We saw the Communist leaders in Italy and France and England . They are tough , hard , fanatical , well-financed and clever . They have the whole misery of the people to trade on . The European Governments are mostly made up of men who are old and tired and have n't the drive and determination of the Communists . " One of the most cunning and toughest of Europe 's Reds , according to Congressmen : Italy 's Togliatti . <P> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedy is that the United States story is not getting out . We sit over here and argue about whether we 'll spend eight or 18 millions to present our side of the case . In France , the Communists got all the best newspapers after liberation , and the biggest allotment of newsprint . We ship in wheat and not a word of it gets in the paper . Russia sends in a boatload of wheat , makes the French transport it and pay for it in American dollars , and you 'd think it was the millennium from the way the Communist newspapers play it . <P> " The people incline naturally to the United States , but every day they are being poisoned , just as literally as if it were being shot into their veins . And we are doing virtually nothing to combat it . " <P> Europeans were also filled with misconceptions of U.S. intentions . They looked upon the U.S. as a horn of plenty with the big end pointing in their direction . In Austria and Germany , startled Congressmen ran into posters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Marshall Plan , and that all Europe had to do was line up with its hand out . Many of the posters , said the Congressmen , were put out through U.S. military government sources . Many Europeans also seemed to believe that the Marshall Plan , with its program of exports , was something devised to save the U.S. from economic collapse . <P> Order &; Chaos . One of the achievements of the Herter committeemen was their nation-by-nation report which they will take back to their constituents . <P> " Britain , " said one committeeman , " is disintegrating in the greatest order ever displayed , and France is recovering in the greatest chaos imaginable . " The key to Britain 's recovery was production of coal , and in that effort Britain had fallen flat . Miners , in fear of mechanization , clung to old methods , persisted in working the short week because more than half their extra day 's pay would have to go to the Government in taxes . <P> The French were still staggering under the moral shame of the occupation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . French peasants were reluctant to sell their produce for worthless francs ; as a result , hunger stalked the cities .
