BASKET CARRY A STORY BY JEROME WEIDMAN r-rHE cuckoo clock on the wall over the gun rack gave a short , whirring warning and the little wooden bird popped out . The man sitting at the card table in front of the fireplace and the woman in the straight-backed chair near him took the cups of hot milk from their lips and looked up . Both watched while the little wooden bird bobbed its head and the clock said " cuckoo " ten times . The man glanced at his wrist watch , an elaborate , very thin affair made of platinum , with a tiny diamond in the stem , and compared it with the clock . Then he shook down his sleeve and his eyes met those of the woman . " Bed ? " she said . Mr. Cromer nodded and the woman set her cup on the card table . He put his cup beside it , picked up the cards laid out in a game of solitaire , and shuffled them twice . The woman watched while he slipped them into a cardboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , palms down , and started to push himself up out of the chair . An automobile roared up to the front of the Lodge and stopped . The sound of voices and quick laughter came in through the closed door . Feet pounded up the front steps and the bell rang loudly in the quiet room . Mr. Cromer 's head twisted round sharply . He sank back into his chair . The woman looked startled and then worried . Miss Brinker came hurrying out of the dining room , clasping and unclasp .. ing her thin , blue-veined hands . She glanced up at the cuckoo clock as she went to the door . " Oh , dear , " she said nervously . " Guests . At this hour . " She did not sound like the owner of a winter resort who depended on guests for a livelihood . She pulled open the front door and stood aside . The wind whipped across the large room , bending the flames flat in the fireplace and causing them to roar . Two couples came in , two girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold , laughing happily . They were bundled to the ears in fur coats . The girls carried small handbags and ski poles . The young men were loaded down with heavy suitcases and two sets of skis each . The four young people set their luggage in front of the registry desk and stamped the snow from their shoes . They tugged at their gloves , blew on their cold hands , and smiled appreciatively as they examined the furnishings of the main hall . Miss Brinker closed the front door . The flames in the fireplace straightened and burned upward again . Miss Brinker walked round the group of young people and stepped behind the registry desk . " Oh , Harry , look ! " one of the girls cried . She pulled the sleeves of both young men and pointed to the mounted moose head over the fireplace . " Alvin , look ! The moose . Just like Tuffy said ! " All four turned to look at the moose head with pleasure . Their quick approving glances took in the gaudy Indian scatter rugs on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish on the walls , the gun rack in the corner under the cuckoo clock , the deep comfortable furniture with rustic frames , the stairway to the left of the fireplace with the log railing from which only the twigs had been chopped away , leaving the frayed ends of curling bark . " My God , " Alvin said . " It looks like an ad for Abercrombie and Fitch . " Harry and the two girls laughed . Then they noticed Mr. Cromer and the woman in front of the fireplace and their laughter stopped short . They did n't know it of course , but the same thought had occurred to each of them . Mr. Cromer , like the rest of the room , looked a shade too perfect , as though he were posed for a picture that was to be used in a brochure to be sent to a mailing list of prospective guests . He was a heavy man with broad shoulders and thick wrists , but he was not fat . His handsome face was full of sharp-edged planes , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axe , and even though he was very pale he looked ruddy and tanned in the firelight . His thick brown hair , parted neatly on the left side , was gray at the temples . He wore an expensive tweed sports jacket in a colorful yet subdued check over a plaid flannel shirt and a black knitted tie . He seemed to be about fifty , perhaps a year or two younger . There were two odd things about him : his earlobes were pierced , although this was not visible except at very close range so that the young people at the other side of the room could not possibly have noticed it , and he seemed to be sucking himself in round some inner pain , as though he had a bad toothache and were trying to conceal it . The woman who sat near him , very erect in a straight-backed chair even though all the soft chairs were unoccupied , seemed young by comparison with Mr. Cromer . She appeared to be somewhere between MAGAZINE thirty-five and forty . She wore a tweed skirt , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , undistinguished figure , and a delicate , filmy woolen scarf rested across her shoulders . Mr. Cromer stared back steadily at the four young people . The woman beside him dropped her eyes nervously . " Excuse me , " Miss Brinker said . " Will you sign the book , please ? " The four newcomers turned back to face her . The young men wrote on the blank page , putting " Mr. and Mrs. " before and " New York , N. Y. " after their names . The girls chattered away , explaining brightly to Miss Brinker that they were on their way to Canada for a three-week skiing trip , that a friend of theirs named Tuffy Fuller  --  Harwood L. Fuller but Tuffy for short  --  had insisted they stop off here for a few days , that they were sorry to arrive so late but they had lost the road two hours after they left Bangor and it had taken them ages to find their way again , that they were simply enchanted with the place already , that if it looked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they saw no reason for going up to Canada at all . Miss Brinker listened to them , smiling politely , occasionally looking with faint concern across their heads at Mr. Cromer and the woman with the woolen scarf . When the young men finished registering she told them they could have two rooms on the first floor . These were the only rooms that were ready because the season was over and the rest of the Lodge was closed down . She imagined they would find the rooms satisfactory , but if they did n't why , they could change in the morning . " I 'm sure they 'll be fine , " Alvin said heartily , rubbing his hands . " I 'm sure everything is fine . What do you say , gang ? " " I say a drink , " Harry said . " I 'm frozen . " He pulled a bottle of liquor from the pocket of his fur coat and held it up . Alvin reached for the bottle , but Harry swung it out of his reach . They wrestled for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two girls cheered them on . Finally , with a quick movement , Alvin 's wife captured the bottle and darted round the big table that stood behind the large couch facing the fireplace . She waved the bottle triumphantly . " You two get rid of the luggage , " she called . " Alice and I will take good care of this till you get back . Wo n't we ? " " Oh , boy , " Alice laughed . " Willwe I " Miss Brinker rang the bell on the desk and Mrs. Wytrikush , the cook , came out of the kitchen , across the dining room , and into the main hall . Miss Brinker took two keys from their hooks in the wan of boxes behind her . " Twenty-two and twenty-four , " she said to Mrs. Wytrikush as she gave her the keys . " Will you show the gentlemen up , please ? " The stolid Polish woman nodded and led the way up the stairs to the left of the fireplace . The young men carried the luggage . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two girls . " Lay off that stuff till we come down , " he shouted . " No fair getting a head start . " " All right , " his wife called . " But hurry , will you ? " The two girls took off their fur coats and tossed them on the couch . They walked to the fireplace and smiled at Mr. Cromer and the woman with the woolen scarf while they warmed their hands . Mr. Cromer smiled back at them . The woman with the scarf looked worried . " This fire is wonderful , " Harry 's wife said . " I 'm simply frozen . Oh , Miss Brinker . May we have some glasses ? " " Of course . " Miss Brinker came out from behind the desk . " I 'll get them myself . You see , the season is over and most of the servants are gone . Mrs. Wytrikush and I are practically all that 's left . Except for a man at the bathing but to take care of the medicated baths . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry 's wife said , " arriving like this ? " " Heavens , no , " Miss Brinker said , smiling . " Would you like some ice and soda too ? " " Oh , yes , please . That would be wonderful . Thanks . " The girl smiled down at Mr. Cromer and the woman with the scarf . " Would you join us in a drink ? " The woman with the scarf smiled nervously and shook her head . Mr. Cromer looked at the girl for a long moment without speaking . Then he smiled too , a small , almost imperceptible movement of his lips , and he nodded . " Yes , thank you , " he said . " I should like that very much . " His voice sounded deep and full , as though lie were speaking through a megaphone . The woman with the scarf looked startled and then , very quickly , her smooth forehead broke into its series of worried lines . She glanced at Mr. Cromer , but he refused to meet her eyes . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Would you bring five glasses then , please ? " Harry 's wife said to Miss Brinker . " Unless ? ? " Once more she looked inquiringly at the woman with the scarf . The woman shook her head again . " Five glasses then , " Harry 's wife repeated . " And the ice and soda . Please . Thank you . " Miss Brinker went out . Alvin and Harry came running down the stairs . Alvin dashed round the table . Harry followed him , stopped , and started round the other way . Alvin tried to stop and change his course , but he was too late . Harry caught him . They tumbled to the floor , laughing and pummeling each other . The girls watched with delight and cheered for their husbands . The woman with the scarf seemed bewildered by this sudden and cheerful yet startlingly loud disturbance in the room that had been so quiet only a few minutes before . Her troubled glance shifted to Mr. Cromer . He was watching the wrestling young men with the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his pierced earlobes gently . Miss Brinker came in with a tray containing glasses , a bucket of ice , and two bottles of soda . She set it down on the table behind the couch and watched the wrestlers good-naturedly . Harry swung Alvin over on his side . Alvin saw the tray . " Hey ! " he yelled . " The drinks ! " Harry released him at once . They jumped up and crowded round the table while Harry 's wife mixed the drinks . Miss Brinker stood aside , her thin hands folded in front of her , until she was sure everything was all right . Then she went out quietly . Harry counted the glasses , saw that there were five , and handed the first highball to Mr. Cromer with a broad smile and a flourish . " There you are , sir . Health ! " " Thank you , " Mr. Cromer said . " Thank you very much . " He held the drink until the others had theirs . " I want my first one straight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way down to the bone . " " You 've got a point there , boy , " Harry said , grinning . " I want one straight too . " They tossed off their drinks , smacked their lips , and turned back to the tray for fresh ones . " Now take it easy , you two , " Harry 's wife said , sipping her highball . " You 've had a lot of that stuff to-day . " " We 've done a lot of freezing to-day , " Alvin said , swinging about with a fresh drink . He raised his glass to Mr. Cromer . " Your health , sir . " " And yours , " Mr. Cromer said . His deep , full voice sounded a trifle sarcastic , but nobody seemed to notice it except the woman with the woolen scarf . " Your very good health . " Mr. Cromer sipped delicately while Alvin and Harry drank deeply . They pulled the glasses away from their mouths , gasped happily , and their eyes met . " Come on , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his drink and took MAGAZINE up a stance with his legs spread and his right arm outstretched . " Let 's see you throw me . " " A cinch , " Harry said . He set down his glass and took up a similar position , facing Alvin , their right feet touching . They clasped hands . " Ready , Tarzan ? " Alvin nodded . They bent toward each other and started to push . They strained and swayed , jerking to the left and then to the right . The veins stood out on their foreheads and their faces flushed deep red , but they did not stop grinning . Suddenly , with a deft shove to the left , Alvin swung Harry off balance . He tottered for a moment , fighting to remain upright , but he could n't . To save himself from falling he had to move his left foot from the floor . Alvin released his hand and stepped back . " I told you ! " he yelled gleefully . " I told you ! " " One more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of three . " " First a drink , " Alvin said , breathing deeply . " I 'm cold . You need one too . Tone up your flabby muscles . " They had another drink and then they wrestled again . Alvin won again . Harry insisted that they make it three out of five instead of two out of three . Alvin refused unless he could have a drink between matches . His wife said no . Harry urged her to let Alvin have the drink . She laughed and shrugged and said all right . She had one with her husband . After the drink the two young men wrestled again . This time Harry won . The laughter grew louder . Alvin won the next bout , giving him three out of five . Harry wanted to make it four out of seven . Alvin said it was no use . " Make it eight out of eleven or eighty-eight out of a hundred , " he said loftily , grinning across the rim of his glass . " It wo n't make any difference . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Cromer . " Have n't I ? " " Clearly , " Mr. Cromer said with a short nod . " It would seem so . " " Another drink , sir ? " " Why , yes . Thank you . " The woman with the woolen scarf looked more worried than ever . Alvin poured drinks for everybody . Harry had an idea . He admitted he was n't much good at leg wrestling . Hand wrestling was his game . Alvin grinned disdainfully and shrugged . " Anything you say , " he said , setting down his glass . " Let 's go . " They looked round for a flat surface and their eyes fell on the card table at which Mr. Cromer was sitting , holding his second drink . Alvin looked at him inquiringly . " May we ? " he asked . Mr. Cromer nodded . " Ali right , boy , " Alvin said , slapping Harry 's back . " Get a chair . " The girls stepped out of the way . The young men seized two straight-backed chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down facing each other . Mr. Cromer was in the middle , his back to the fire . The fourth side of the table was unoccupied , so that the arrangement resembled a game of bridge from which the dummy had risen and Left the room for a while . Mr. Cromer leaned back in his chair , holding his drink aside , to keep out of the way . The two young men put their right elbows on the table , clasped hands , and started to wrestle . The flimsy table swayed and creaked as they strained . Alvin 's arm gave way first . Harry roared with laughter . " Two out of three , " Alvin said . " Come on . I gave you two out of three . " They locked hands once more . Harry won again . " Three out of five , " Alvin insisted . " I gave you three out of five . " " Whatever you say , " Harry said with a shrug and a grin , imitating the gesture Alvin had made when he won the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a hundred . I 've got you beat . " He turned to Mr. Cromer . " Have n't I ? " " Why , yes , " Mr. Cromer said slowly . " I should think so . " " Well , let 's see , " Alvin said . " Let 's try it . I 'm not so sure . " . Harry won two more in a row , making four out of four . " I guess that makes it pretty clear who 's champ at this table , " Harry said , laughing boisterously . " Does n't it , sir ? " Mr. Cromer tugged gently at his pierced earlobe . " I do n't know , " he said . " You have n't tried me . " The two young men stopped grinning . The woman with the shawl sat up straighter in her chair . She shook her head warningly and pursed her worried lips . The wives of the young men looked at each other , eyebrows raised . " Well , " Alvin said awkwardly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Cromer said . " Shall we ? " He shifted the drink to his left hand and put his right elbow on the table . The young men looked at each other and hesitated . " Either one , " Mr. Cromer said , smiling politely . " It does n't matter . " Harry nodded to Alvin , who put his elbow up without enthusiasm and clasped hands gingerly with Mr. Cromer . They got into position . Mr. Cromer looked inquiringly at the young man . Alvin nodded . They pressed toward each other . Mr. Cromer forced the young man 's arm down with ease . Everybody except Mr. Cromer and the woman with the scarf looked surprised . " You were n't trying very hard , " he said through his thin lips . " Once more , shall we ? " Alvin nodded grimly . This time he tried hard . The veins stood out on his forehead and his face flushed . He could not budge the older man 's arm . Mr. Cromer 's lips broke into their faint sarcastic smile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had enough he shoved his arm over hard . The young man gave way . Once again everybody seemed astonished except Mr. Cromer and the woman with the scarf . Alvin gave a short embarrassed laugh . Mr. Cromer disregarded him . He looked disdainfully at Harry . The other young man did n't seem to want to wrestle , but he hesitated only a few seconds . He put up his arm . Mr. Cromer clasped his hand . Harry nodded . Mr. Cromer forced Harry 's arm to the table with almost no effort at all . " I shouidn ' l say that either of you is very good , " Mr. Cromer said dryly . " Unless you 're being kind to what you must think is an old man . " Harry blushed . His jaw tightened as he put his elbow back on the table . Mr. Cromer 's sardonic smile dug into his cheek . He clasped the young man 's hand carelessly and waited . Harry nodded that he was ready . He rose slightly in his chair with the strength of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in position easily and then , with a sharp push , forced the young man 's arm down . Harry sat hack , panting , and looked at Mr. Cromer in astonishment . " Well , " he said uncomfortably , massaging his palm , " I guess ? " Mr. Cromer smiled at Alvin . " You ? " he said . " Once more ? " " Hell , no , " Alvin said , getting up . " I know when I 'm licked . I 'm going to bed . " Harry jumped up , too . He looked at Mr. Cromer as though he did n't know what to say . " Congratulations , " he said finally . " I did n't think ? " " I know you did n't , " Mr. Cromer said abruptly . " Good-night . " The young men and their wives stood uncomfortably for several moments , looking at one another and into their drinks . Then , as though by agreement , they all said good-night at once to Mr. Cromer and to the woman with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tray . They stumbled against one another , said good-night again , and climbed the stairs to the left of the fireplace . Mr. Cromer watched them go , tugging gently at his pierced earlobe and smiling faintly . When they were gone the woman with the scarf shook her head disapprovingly . " Well , really , " she said mildly . " Really , Mr. Cromer . " He did n't answer . He slipped the deck of cards into the pocket of his sports jacket . The woman stood up and walked across the room to the registry desk . She stepped behind it and took down two keys from the tier of boxes with hooks in them . Mr. Cromcr pushed himself up into a standing position and grasped a cane that was hanging on the back of his chair . The woman watched anxiously as he tottered across the floor , pushing his arthritic legs ahead of him several inches at a time , supporting his heavy body with the cane . His pale face grew flushed with the intensity of his effort until the tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dots of ink on the pink flesh . He looked like a man edging his way out cautiously on a pond covered with thin ice to rescue a dog that had broken through . The woman with the scarf made small anxious movements with her hands every time he took a step , as though she wanted to help him but she did n't dare . It took him a full minute to cover the short stretch of floor between his chair and the stairs . When he reached the bottom step , Mr. Cromer paused to get his breath . He smiled with grim satisfaction , shifted the cane to his left hand , and grasped the rough rail with the curling bark in his right . " Good going to-night , eh ? " he said sarcastically across his shoulder . " Record time . " " Very good , " the woman said . " I 'll probably make the Olympic team , " he said . " For crawling . " The woman walked swiftly across the room . She stood beside Mr. Cromer , her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath and started up . The stairs were much more difficult . He kept his weight on his right leg , held himself firmly erect with the help of the cane and the railing , stuck his left leg out stiffly , swung it up to the next step , and then hoisted the right leg and the rest of his body up to join the left leg . It was a slow , painful process . He paused for ten or fifteen seconds on each step before attempting the next one . When he was on the sixth step a door on the floor above slammed hard and feet came pounding down the corridor . Mr. Cromer glanced up sharply . The woman looked frightened . Alvin and Harry , laughing at some private joke , came running down the stairs , past Mr. Cromer and the woman with the scarf . They ran to the couch and picked up the fur coats their wives had left behind . " It 's colder up there than we thought , " Alvin said , grinning . " The girls want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not answer . He waited for the young men to pass him . They waited for him to precede them . There was an awkward moment . Alvin gestured upward with the arm across which his wife 's fur coat rested . " After you , sir , " he said politely . Mr. Cromer did not answer . His flushed face grew darker and his hands on the cane and the railing tightened until the knuckles went white . The woman with the scarf stared worriedly from the man on the stairs beside her to the young men slightly below . Mr. Cromer turned his head back to the stairs , tightened his jaw until his lips disappeared , and started . As soon as he thrust his stiff left leg up to the next step and began to heave himself after it the young men stopped smiling politely . They looked startled . They stared with surprise at Mr. Cromer 's arthritic legs . Then they looked at each other , their mouths open and their eyes wide . The glance that passed between the two young men was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also in it a trace of satisfaction , a hint of some inner shame being washed away . When they swung their heads back to Mr. Cramer they no longer hated him for what he had done to them at the bridge table a few minutes earlier . Ills victory did not count . " I 'm sorry , sir , " Alvin said quietly . " We did n't know . Look here . " He moved forward . " Suppose we give you a lift , sir ? " Mr. Cromer did n't answer . He bent his head down and swung his left leg up to the next step . Alvin and Harry dropped the fur coats and jumped to the first step . The woman with the scarf motioned them back . Mr. Cromer heaved his body up to meet his left leg . He raised the cane to the next step , took a deep breath , and started the process again . The young men looked at each other . " The basket carry ? " Alvin asked . Harry nodded . They locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seat . " No trouble at all , sir , " Alvin said to Mr. Cromer 's back . " Here . You just sit on this and we 'll carry you up . It 's easy , sir . " Mr. Cromer shook his head without turning . The woman with the scarf looked down at the young men and shook her head again pleadingly . They did n't see her . They mounted the steps swiftly , their hands and wrists locked in the basket carry , until they were behind the man with the cane , almost touching the back of his expensive sports jacket . " No kidding , sir , " Alvin said cheerfully . " It 's no trouble at all . We can carry you up without ? " Mr. Cromer 's body heaved . He clutched the railing with his right hand and lifted the cane . " Get the hell away from me , " he snarled through his bloodless lips . He swung the cane behind him in a vicious arc . The rubber tip just missed Alvin 's knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unclasping their locked hands and wrists . " If you come near me   ? I 'll ? " Mr. Cromer stopped and drew a deep breath . " Just stay the hell away from me , " he said in a flat , deadly voice , his back to the young men , his head bent . " Both of you . " The young men glanced at each other in shocked astonishment , then turned back to look up the stairs . The woman with the shawl gave them a glance of worried apology . They remained motionless at the foot of the stairway until Mr. Cramer finished struggling up the steps and disappeared , the woman with the shawl hovering behind him . The swinging door from the kitchen groaned as it was pushed open . Footsteps tapped across the dining room . The young men swung round . Miss Brinker came in from the dining room and stopped short . " Oh , " she said , clasping her thin , blue-veined hands . " I thought I heard Mr. Cromer and his nurse going up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone to bed . I thought I 'd take the tray . " " No , leave it , " Alvin said abruptly , and then added , " Please . " Miss Brinker nodded and gave them a worried glance . " He 's a very nice man , " she said awkwardly . " I feel very sorry for him . " Alvin did n't answer . He walked to the table behind the sofa and poured whiskey from the bottle into two glasses . Harry followed him and tipped the bottle in Alvin 's hand to make the drink ' stronger . Miss Brinker 's worried glance grew deeper . " If you 'll ring when you 're finished , " she said , " Mrs. Wytrikush will come in put out the lights . " " She does n't have to bother , " Alvin said , pouring the soda . " We 'll put out the lights . Goad-night . " " Thank you , " Miss Brinker said . " Good-night . " She hesitated another moment and then went out . Harry stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soda . " Say , listen , " he said in a puzzled voice . " What did he want to do a thing like that for ? " " How should I know ? " Alvin said shortly . " Hurry up with your drink . The girls are waiting for the coats . " THE IMPROVIDENT BY NANCY BICKEL W HAT shall we the lovers do at last Except resign to earth our loving parts ?
