THE PARTING A STORY BY THOMAS SANCTON C RAIG found pleasure in being alone . The upstairs porch became his small , neat corner of the world . He played quietly with his toys and his imagination made strange and wonderful things of them . He sang gaily to himself . When questions came into his mind , having no one to talk to , he sat motionless for long periods , his round little face serious in meditation . Sometimes when a thought of humor or nonsense came to him he broke into full , lonely laughter . He loved the rain . Each afternoon in the hot summer when clouds gathered and the rain came beating into the oaks and myrtles which lined the boulevard he pulled his little chair to the porch rail and held up his face , with eyes screwed tightly shut , to catch the raindrops in his mouth . On sunny days , with an overpowering interest , he watched the people walking past and the automobiles and street cars . One day as Craig stood at the porch rail watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . She was giggling in an embarrassed manner and she held a dripping newspaper above her head . " Li ' boy , " she said , " go call your mama . " Craig laughed and laughed at her . She looked so funny standing in the rain . " Go call your mama , li ' boy , " she said patiently . " She 's not home , " he answered . That week his mother had gone back to work for the railroad . " Can I come in and sit on de steps , li ' boy ? " the woman asked . " I wants to wait for her . " Craig ran down the stairs and opened the door . She came in laughing and moaning and began to wipe her face with a wet handkerchief . " Laved , dass a rain ! " she said . She sat on the steps with a weary sigh . Craig plopped to the floor and sat watching her with interest . She was very black . Her eyes were bright and friendly and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something odd about her face , for the thick lower lip turned out so far that Craig could see its moist pink inside . He wondered if she held her lip this way on purpose . The woman became aware of his inspection . " I is a funny lookin ' somethin ' at dat , " she said , giggling . " Why do you do your lip that way ? " he asked seriously , demonstrating what he meant . " I do n't do it no way , " she said . " It do datta-way itself . " " Why does it ? " " God done told it to do datta-way when he bake me in de oven . " " Why did he tell it that ? " " He ai n't esplained it to me yet , honey . My , you is a question box . " She reached out gently and brushed the thick blond hair away from his forehead . " What your name , Mr. Whitey ? " she asked . " Craig Magruder . What 's yours ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see my mama for ? " " She need a cullud woman . " " No she do n't . My mama does all the work . " " Yes she do . She done told de cullud girl dat work next door to find her someone . I hope it gon na be me . " " Oh boy , " said Craig , slapping the backs of his legs against the floor in delight . He sang a little wishing song . " I hope you work for us , I hope you work for us . . . . " " Honey , " she said , " I done come all de way from de country tryin ' to find me some easy work . I been swingin ' a cane knife ever since I a li ' girl , about de size you is . Chop , chop , chop , and dass a heavy knife , honey . Feel like a ton . Cane cut like wet grass in de mornin ' but it sure get tough around quittin ' time . Old Pearl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't get work around dis city . " She worked for Craig 's family for six years , and in the end she went back . But this rainy day , as they sat at the foot of the stairs , kind little black woman , lonely white boy , their lives ran together forever . Craig 's mother hired Pearl that evening . She needed a woman to keep the house , for now she had taken her old job with the railroad company . Early in the morning she left the house with her husband for the office building where they had met ten years before and they did not return until late . Someone was needed to look after Craig . He was almost six now . Fall was corning and it was now time for him to start school . Alice Magruder was small , slender , and restless . Illness had worn away a certain wistful prettiness which when she was a girl had been generally admired by the bookkeepers and file clerks of the railroad . Her face was sharp , yet a traceof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come very close to death when Craig was born . But during the night of her crisis some small , indestructible fury lying deep in her suffering body had flared , and it carried her through a long , desperate rally . But her health was never good again and she felt that a part of her indeed had died . She took no more interest in her looks or in her dress . She laughed no longer at her husband 's gentle childish jokes . And the romantic love she had once felt for this amiable little bookkeeper was gone . She had only one purpose now  --  to work and accumulate for the baby she had made with such agony . She wanted to fight for him as an animal would fight for its young , and her love had an animal 's strange , inattentive lapses . She wanted to rend an avenue through the meager little destiny into which she had borne him . In the hours of her crisis she had held fast to one delirious dream : to buy a house that would produce an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dream had never left her . For the first two years after her illness she saved from Magruder 's salary to pay doctor bills . In two more years she had accumulated enough to make a down payment on a house . But then it was a bad time to buy real estate , and Willis Magruder , with his simple bookkeeper 's talent for arithmetic , knew from the beginning that the purchase was a mistake . The house stood on the corner of a fine old boulevard , and its glaring white weatherboards and cheap roof of rose-tinted shingles did not blend into the dark , comfortable old homes of the neighborhood . A real estate boom had marked the street with these new places like a pox . Some of the old families , no longer prospering in banking and cotton , had sold the spacious lawns between their homes for high prices to speculating contractors . The house that Magruder bought had been built for eight thousand dollars . The contractor sold it to a speculating homestead finance company for eleven thousand . The company sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two thousand and the company took a mortgage for the remainder  --  to he paid over a period of years at a hundred dollars a month . The house was a popular boom type , called a duplex . It was built for two families , and everything downstairs , all of the rooms , even the swing and chairs on the front porch , had its duplicate above . The Magruders moved into the upper quarters . Alice rented out the lower floor for a sum which almost met the monthly homestead payment ; for rent charges had soared along with real estate values . But Willis had been right . The purchase was a mistake . Within two years the boom collapsed ; rents and real estate values toppled and the tenant broke his lease and moved away . It was months before Alice could rent the place again for half the amount . It became impossible to meet the homestead payment . So Alice hired a typewriter and dug into an old trunk for her shorthand textbooks . For weeks she practiced to regain her skill , working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire with Western story magazines , watching her restlessly . " Alice , " he said at last , " let 's go rent us a little house and be happy again . " " Let 's not get started on the subject , " she answered . She did not look up from her work . " Let 's give this damned place back to the homestead and be happy again , " he said in a dreamy , bitter tone . " Let 's go back to the old place . Let 's go all the way back  --  six years . To the time I had a wife . " " Listen , " she said quietly , staring at him . " It 's for my baby , you understand . I do n't care about us . We 're going to own this place and the income is going to send him to college . Do you think I went through hell to bring another ribbon clerk into the world ? " Willis looked into the fire and said nothing . He was thinking of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night to be taken into his arms , and he had hurried home after work trying to remember all the funny things he had heard during the day so he might make her laugh at the dinner table . He never discussed the house with her after this talk , and he spoke to her less of other things , In a few weeks Alice got work with the railroad again as a stenographer . Her salary was small , but by close management she was able to meet the homestead payment once more . The tiring office work and her money worries kept her in a state of distress . Early in his life , Craig 's happiness , for which she had forged her own life into such a grim contest , fell among the things which she sacrificed unconsciously in the effort . She answered his childish questions sharply and scolded him often , and the boy fell into the habit of silence . He could remember a time when his father cuffed him merrily about and laughed with him , but this somehow had passed . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house and the homestead company were the cause of all the small unhappy things of his life . These were small incidents , and it never occurred to his parents that they went below the surface of their quiet little son . When the family went to the park on Sundays there was never any money for ice cream or balloons or for peanuts to throw to the snorting old elephant . When he rode on the street cars with his mother he stood in quiet shame while she argued with the conductor about his age . When she brought him into a department store for a new pair of shoes or a sailor suit she haggled over the prices with the polite , exasperated floorwalkers . At night Alice came into his room to hear his prayers . Craig kneeled beside the bed and put his head in her lap . In his long sleepers , which covered his feet , he looked like a soft little rabbit . He was freshly bathed , and the sweet smell of her child stirred the timeless , mammalian love within her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the covers and turned out the light , and lay beside him , holding him tenderly . Sometimes in the darkness Craig could hear her weeping softly . Craig kissed her again and again . " It 's such a struggle , son , " she said . " Mother does n't mean to fuss at you so much . But oh , the worries . Oh , my baby , if you could only understand ! " Craig buried his head in her arms and held her tightly . There was something he wanted desperately to say to her . Oh , mother , be soft and gentle and loving to me , as you are now always . Take me out of my little unhappy world , my loneliness , my silence , my long hours alone on the porch . I 'm a little boy and I need you . He could never find the words . He was hungry for her love with an aching hunger that never left him . But in the morning , Alice awakened cross and sullen . Her health was poor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fuss at him so much ; but nevertheless she did . And then came the little Negro woman and changed his life . It was early fall now , and Alice entered Craig in the first grade . The schoolhouse was on the boulevard not far away , a yellow-brick building in a grassy square , with a graceful row of dark magnolia trees before it . Pearl took him to school each morning and came for him at lunchtime and in the afternoon . Craig thrilled to these new exciting days . The weather was bright and cool , with a clean , stirring smell . Acorns were dropping from the oaks along the boulevard , and he made Pearl wait while he filled his pockets with them . He loved the gabble of talk at lunchtime in the warm basement , the murmuring of the classrooms , the sweet pervading odor of apples and lunch boxes . Craig 's parents left for their work before he awakened and did not return until evening . Pearl roused him in the morning by bouncing the mattress of his bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicking against her strong little arms as she tickled him . For the rest of the day she was his faithful servant . She laced his high-topped shoes and brushed his stubborn yellow hair , holding his head over the wash basin and sprinkling it with a swishing handful of water as she did the laundry before ironing . And then she fixed his breakfast . Her presence filled the house . Her musky odor hung faintly through the rooms . She talked to Craig constantly , simple , cheerful talk that delighted him , and she sang hymns , rolling her eyes fervently to heaven . To Craig the melodies were infinitely sad  --  wailing melodies he had never heard before  --  but he thought the words were very funny , and sometimes they set him giggling . My road have come to de river bank ? Sister Beulah , come carry me over .. . " Honey , " Pearl told him , " Jesus make it rain if you laugh at a hymn . Watch and see if he do n't . " The next time it rained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " What I told you , Craig ? " And Craig believed that he had brought the rain . But his feeling was one of proud accomplishment . She spoke to him from a child 's heart and he understood her , and her simple stories raised up before his delighted eyes the world of earth and crops that he had never known existed . She told him how Negroes worked the fat cane rows with their knives , and lived in cabins , and dug wells , and baked their bread ; of the food wagon which came out from the big house into the fields at noon to the hungry workers  --  with cornbread , cold salty cabbage , mustard greens , hog-meat , sausage , potato cake . She was devoted to her father and spoke of him often , and the querulous old Negro became Craig 's favorite character . She told him how her father , Luke , a patriarch who had outlived two earlier wives , had once been the best Negro on the place ; but now he was very old and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which the younger field hands drank . " Dat make papa some mad , " she said , laughing at the scene in her memory . " He say dis and he say dat ; and he howl , and he stomp , and he cuss . Lawd , how papa could cuss . Papa say , Dis ai n't no work for a man . Dis a child work . Water cart ! For God sake . I done started out my life on de water cart  --  before dese niggers was born . Dis a child work , damn itr " Poor old papa . He do n't know jes ' how old and feeble he be . Poor papa think he still young and can jump . He jes ' old and feeble and he do n't want to say it . " Anything could remind Pearl of life on the plantation . Craig sat upon the bed with his foot in her lap as she laced his shoes . Pearl told him about the rawhide thongs the Negroes made on the plantation . He asked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honey . Dey done knock de cow on he haid and pull he skin off and slice it up . " " Does the cow die ? " he asked , making a wry face . " He die and den some , " she said laughing . " Where you thought meat come from , honey ? Off de bush ? " At lunchtime Pearl waited for him by a clump of thick rhododendron bushes which covered a corner of the school-yard . Negro servant girls from the neighborhood gathered here talking and laughing . They sat on a railing of iron pipe which protected the bushes , enjoying the respite from their housework . When the lunch bell rang children ran to the corner with shrill , familiar chattering , and threw their books into the Negroes ' arms . Craig walked home with his hand in Pearl 's . They raced each other up the stairs with wild laughter . She set before him a bowl of soup or sandwiches and a glass of milk , and then went down the back steps to the wash tubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days Craig kept running to the kitchen window to watch this new , wonderful person . The boy grew to love the afternoons . At three o'clock Pearl brought him home again from school . He sat at a table in the warm kitchen to do his homework . Now the laundry was dry and stiff , piled high in a big wicker basket , and Pearl set up the ironing board and began to work . Bright sunlight slanted into the windows and outside the street cars stopped and started with a somnolent , faraway rumbling . The clean odor of starch under the hot iron filled the kitchen . Pearl was busy with her own thoughts now and said little . She ironed with easy skill and sang her hymns softly . Sometimes her hands fell to her sides as she lifted her voice on a sad , wavering note . Craig copied his simple spelling lessons with a thick pencil , forming the newly learned letters with his lips , and making laborious faces . Suddenly a craving for conversation would take him , and he stood before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , breathless account of an experience at school : the teacher had said he was talking and he was n't talking , and he told the teacher it was n't him and she said it was him and he said it was n't either . . . . Sometimes it was a tale of childish joy , sometimes of calamity  --  a tumble down the school steps or a punch on the nose . To Pearl it made little difference , for her thoughts were far away and she did not hear him . She kept her eyes on her work . But at the proper times she shook her head agreeably and said , " Dass nice , honey . " Sometimes these pleasantries fell into the middle of a most harrowing narrative . But as long as she seemed to be listening Craig was satisfied . More than satisfied ; he was happy . They teased each other constantly during the day ; name calling became a game , and Pearl enjoyed it as much as the boy . He invented wild , outlandish names to call her  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rat-tail monkey Pearl . With each new name she clapped her hands to her face and wailed hilariously . " Lawd , jes ' lissen to what dis boy callin ' Pearl . Ring-tail , rat-tail monkey shines ! Dat is de absolute worst I ever heard ! " Some of these foolish names he kept for years and they became a bond of affection between them . Once when he was very young he called her a nigger . She had angered him by washing his smudged face at lunchtime . Craig had heard Pearl use the word herself and he had heard his parents use it . But somehow he understood already that the word contained all the great gulf of things that was fixed between his color and hers . It hurt Pearl instantly . Her thick lips puckered and tears filmed her eyes , and she sat at the kitchen table with her head in her arms like a child . " What you call me dat for , Craig ? " she said sorrowfully . " Do n't you know Pearl de one love you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' stead of white like you is . If He was to change you to a li ' nigger boy and you had to go live in a shack and eat nigger food , do you think Pearl would go callin ' you de name of your trouble ? " When others used it , people for whom she cared nothing , Pearl was moved for a moment to a show of sullen dignity , but that was all . Sometimes the beefy iceman , banging impatiently on the locked door , shouted it up to the kitchen window . " Come on , open the door , nigger . I 'm not going to stand here all day . " The tradesmen who came almost daily into the kitchen , the iceman , the butcher , the grocer boys , called her nigger and many other names . Their manner was good-natured but utterly contemptuous . They called her black , shine , and dark-meat . The boys slammed their wares arrogantly on the kitchen table , and the iceman banged the heavy block into the box with a shower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they called out humorous , obscene suggestions to her , and clattered down the stairs with heavy laughter . Pearl kept her dignity . She made a sneering face and fixed her eyes on her work . There was unconscious farce in her exaggerated scorn . She muttered the old chant of Southern Negroes : " I 'd ruther be a nigger den po ' white trash . " But soon she forgot the incident and was singing hymns . As the years passed , Pearl 's influence on the boy became deeper . Her kindness and laughter nourished happiness back to life within him and filled the voids in his lonely heart . She was totally ignorant . She could not read and she believed in ghosts ; she believed that she talked sometimes , " at dark of de moon , " with the ghost of her sister , and she told Craig some of the messages that she had received . But she was far from stupid . She did her work with an easy , thorough skill . She kept the boy 's meager supply of clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees of his pants and darned his black cotton stockings . Alice had never asked her to do these things . Sometimes Pearl would corner Craig , against his impatient protests , and with surprising speed clip a hanging button from his shirt , thread a needle and sew it firmly back in place . There were other things too which Alice would have done for her son had her life been different , that the little Negro woman gladly made part of her own duty . On rare occasions the boy woke cross and ill . He turned his head into the pillow and told her to go away . She felt his forehead with cool , dark fingers . " What de matter , Craig ? " she asked softly . " You sick , honey ? My li ' boy ai n't feelin ' good ? " " Leave me alone , " he said . " You got a li ' fever , honey . Pearl gon na make you stay in de bed to-day . " She brought him soft eggs and milk . Later in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitable  --  she came to the bed with castor oil in orange juice . Craig wept , but she made him take it . When Alice returned Pearl told her that Craig had been ill and she had kept him home from school . Alice had come to rely on her judgment . Alice 's feeling for Pearl was negative . She paid the woman a standard wage for house servants , and in return got good work , which she expected . When Craig 's parents returned from their work in the evening Pearl became silent . She served the dinner and ate her own in the kitchen ; then she washed the dishes and went home . When they spoke to her she agreed instantly and timidly to whatever they said " bass right , dass right , " was her standing answer . Pearl 's secret feeling for Alice was definite . She did not like her . Craig moved up from one school grade to the next , from one phase of boyhood to another . He came to his share of fist-fights , snagged trousers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole , he was rather quiet , for the solitude of his first years had left its print upon him . He studied hard and did well in his lessons . Craig 's body was neatly made and strong , like his father 's . He played baseball in the schoolyard in spring and summer . The days he loved came in autumn , cool bright days with school life once more at a beginning . He kicked battered footballs in the schoolyard , and the air was filled with thuds and shouting , and echoes which bounded pleasantly from the building . He could run fast , and he played touch football through the long afternoons until his face was hot and sweaty and his knees and the elbows of his sweater were damp with mud and grass stains . He was skillful at climbing the dark boles of the magnolia trees . When spring came round , with other boys he tore off baskets full of the sweet , heavy blossoms and went to sell them for ten cents each before the gleaming marble cemeteries which stretched along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his mother 's struggle to buy the house continued . Night after night she sat at her squat little desk , adding up bills on the backs of old envelopes , counting again and again the money in her cash drawer . Craig sat at a card table before the fire with his books or with the comic section of the evening newspaper . Sometimes he watched her , wondering when this silent , bitter contest would have its end . His father had become a quiet stranger to him . Willis now came home from the office with two desires only ; the first was for dinner , the second to sit by the fire with his Western magazines and the evening paper . He had lost all interest in the house . His hair had grown completely gray , and he was beginning to look middle-aged . The mortgage payment fell due on the fifth of each month . As the day approached Alice spent more time at her desk , checking her accounts . All of her bills were paid with cash , and there was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month Craig watched her go through the old humiliation of telephoning the homestead company to plead for more time  --  until their salary checks were due from the railroad . Alice kept the desk key in a painted blue vase on the mantel . One night as Craig worked over his lessons at the card table he heard his mother turn up the vase and the key fall out with its familiar tinkle . A moment later he was startled by her small agonized cry . She stood before the desk with the cash drawer in her hands . It was empty . She broke into quiet , interminable sobbing , whispering " It 's gone , " over and over . The drawer had contained more than ninety dollars and the mortgage payment was due . Willis took her in his arms and she clung to him like a child . " Oh , that nigger , " she sobbed , almost inaudibly . " Oh , that thieving nigger . " The words sent a chill through Craig . Willis stared over her shoulder , frowning , thinking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all right . " Alice 's face was wet and her lips were trembling . She went to the telephone and asked for the police . Craig ran to her and clicked the connection . " Mama l " he cried frantically . " Please do n't do that . Pearl did n't steal the money . I know she did n't , mama . Pearl would n't ever do anything like that . " Willis snatched the boy 's hand from the telephone and shook him . It was the first time he had ever done this to his son . " Go to your room , " he said sharply . Craig closed his door and lay on the bed in the darkness . Soon the doorbell rang and he heard someone come up the stairs into the living room . Craig went to the door and opened it softly . It was a detective and they were talking about Pearl . The man went to the desk and examined the lock . He was a big man , ' and he kept his hat on . Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy are in the kitchen almost every day , " she said . " The man to read the electric meter might have come to-day . But the girl was the only one who knew where the key was . And she knew there was money in that desk . " The detective grunted and shook his head wearily . " I 've seen this happen a thousand times , " he said . " You people put it right under their noses and then you want the police to get it back for you . Lady , a house nigger is the worst thief there is . They 'd steal Christ off the cross . " He told them that Pearl would be arrested . " If she has n't got the money on her , " he said , " all we can do is book her and hold her a couple of days . If she does n't get scared and tell us where it is we 'll have to turn her loose  --  and good-by money . " When the man left , Craig was sobbing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to sleep . For the next week there was a:dull ache inside him that would not go away . He lay on his bed through the empty afternoons and did not study . At night he dreamed tortured dreams of Pearl and heard her weeping and calling him . He woke in the darkness , restless and lonely . One afternoon he came out of the school building , his book strap slung across his shoulder , and walked slowly down the terraced steps . It was a spring day , and the schoolyard lay warm in the sunlight . He stood on the steps for a while and watched boys climbing into the magnolia trees . High in the branches the foliage was shaking , and he could hear the voices of the hidden climbers . Then he turned down the school walk toward his house . Pearl called to him as he passed the rhododendron clump . She was sitting on a rail where the outthrust blossoming branches were thickest , almost screened from view , as though she were hiding . Craig ran into her arms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pearl love you . " " I told them and told them you did n't steal the money , " he said . " They just made me shut up . Did they hurt you , Pearl ? " " ' Cose I did n't steal no money , " she said . " But dey ai n't hurt me none , Craig . Dey kept me in jail two days , dass all . Do n't you worry about dat , honey . It 's all over with now . Dey had me in a cell with some drunken nigger womans . Me and de po-lice done had our rounds . First dey say I stole de money , and den I say I ai n't . And dere we stood . " Den dey say , ' Huhn , dis dsmart-aleck nigger , ' and dey go to tellin ' me like all which dey gon na do if dey catch me stealin ' again .

And dere dey was , up de tree , so dey turn me aloose . " They sat together on the rail and she held his hand tightly . " Craig , " she said , " I guess I knowed where your maw kept de money since de first day I come to work . Why she think I gon na wait dis long to steal it ? You all jes ' poor people tryin ' to make like you got a little money  --  I know dat . I ai n't gon na go stealin ' bread out your mouf , honey . " Dey 's a lot more people den me seen your maw at de desk , one time another . It could have been one of de grocery boys , or dat no-good iceman . But I know how dis kind of business go , honey .

I ca n't do nothin ' and you ca n't do nothin ' . And dere we is. 1 ) For a while they sat in silence . " I gon na miss you , " she said at last . " I gon na pray for my Ii ' funny boy every day I lives . " There was a finality in the way she said this that frightened him . He looked at her with a question in his eyes . " I goin ' back to de plantation , " she said miserably . " Oh , " he gasped . " Do n't do it , Pearl . I 'll never see you again . " " I goin ' dis Saturday , honey . Dc plantation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cousin . De man dat run de plantation  --  Mr. LaVoicin  --  a long time ago he done sent word to me dat I ought to come back .

" " No , do n't do dat . She your maw and I do n't want to stir up nothin ' between you . " " When are you coming back to the city ? " He said it softly , afraid to hear the answer . " Craig , I reckon never . " The boy put his head in his arms . " I reckon never , Craig , unlessen you can come for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you about .

" Craig read what he had written . " Dass it , " she said . " You a sharp child . " Craig held her hand to his face . " You sure were good to me , Pearl , " he said . He murmured the old name he used to call her . " Old ring-tail rat-tail monkey Pearl . " " Lawd , " she said , her lip trembling . " You ai n't ever forgot dat . 1***46 " .. *WHIP " Well  --  honey , de day gon na come for us . Do n't you ever worry dat it ai n't .
