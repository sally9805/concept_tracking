Out of the blue last week came the biggest labor news in six years . Without warning , wearing an unbecoming dovelike look , tough , gruff John L. Lewis clumped out of his lair brandishing a proposal for - of all things-labor peace . In a long , cooing letter to C.I.O. President Philip Murray and A.F. of L. President William Green , labor 's black storm cloud proposed an end to the violent feud which has split labor for the last six years , kept labor 's house in turmoil . Said Mr. Lewis : <P> " It is obvious that if accouplement* could be achieved . . . the results would be advantageous and in the public interest . " <P> Few people among the dumfounded public were ready to deny this obvious fact . But , knowing Mr. Lewis , they wanted to know a couple of facts about the accouplement before they started applause . For years the animosity of Mr. Lewis and Mr. Green was the chief stumbling block to a reunion of labor . According to one published plan , the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary-Treasurer George Meany ; Mr. Green would be turned out to pasture on a $20,000-a-year pension ; Machiavellian Mr. Lewis would get a vice-presidency ; Mr. Murray , to whom the whole thing came as a complete surprise , and who had good reason to believe he was in the middle of a squeeze play , would be offered the secretary-treasurer 's job at $18,000 . <P> Snapped angry Mr. Murray : " I think I can speak for myself and nobody can trade me for a job . ... I will not be blitzkrieged . . . . " Mr. Green denied that any secret negotiations had taken place or that any deal had been made on new officers . <P> Mr. Lewis ' peace porridge ( if that was what it was ) would need a lot more cooking before it was ready to serve . <P> <P> *The word is in the dictionary . Mr. Lewis is fond of $15 words .
