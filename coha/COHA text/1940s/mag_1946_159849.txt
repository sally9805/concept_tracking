If you wanted to start a newsmagazine ( or newspaper ) there is one indispensable publisher 's item you would be unable to buy-a morgue . <P> Morgue is journalese for " library of essential information . " It is not a commercial product ; it has to be created . TIME 'S morgue has been 23 years abuilding . Now presided over by 55 librarians and helpers , it contains some 400,000 indexed folders of biographical , historical , business , and otherwise usefully classified information , 25,000 reference books , and 400 up-to-date periodicals . Needless to say , we would be lost without it . <P> When TIME began in 1923 , it had no morgue . We had an unabridged dictionary , the college " libraries " of some of our editors , a copy of Who 's Who , and bound copies of a local newspaper ( which went back 20 years but were of no use because they were n't indexed ) . Somebody contributed an encyclopedia , and the Public Library was close by . On closing nights the staff carted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printer 's and checked late copy while the issue went to press . As late as 1929 an office boy with a dolly could move it in half an hour-and sometimes did . <P> This year it took professional movers a full week , working every night , to shift the morgue to new and larger quarters . Their cargo had been-and still is-separated into four major categories : 1 ) books ( standard reference works and pamphlets on all phases of world doings ) ; 2 ) periodicals ( the most important U.S. and foreign magazines and trade journals ) ; 3 ) subject file ( general material on everything from Absinthe to Zoos ) ; 4 ) biographical file ( information on well known peopie , living or dead , from AE , Irish Poet George William Russell 's pseudonym , to Zworykin , Vladimir K. , Russian-born U.S. physicist ) . <P> <P> With this breakdown the morgue 's 16 research librarians , each of whom is a specialist in a specific field ( Foreign News , National Affairs , etc. ) , can fill a TIME writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a hurry . They get about 5,000 requests a month . For a recent issue of TIME they were asked to determine ( among other things ) : the wage rates of natives in the Solomon Islands ; the form of poetry most similar to the rhumba rhythm ; major U.S. cities controlled by Republican mayors ; the number of U.S. synthetic rubber plants that have closed down ; how many Methodists there are in Europe ; the Moslem stand on birth control . <P> Finding this raw material quickly and completely demands patience , imagination and a real knowledge of the resources of the morgue each librarian is responsible for . Their work , however , would be painfully handicapped if the morgue were left to sprout at will . To keep it vigorous , its files have to be constantly pruned of dead material . For example , although some 600 new names are added to the biography file every month , an equal number of folders whose subjects are no longer of news interest are weeded out - illustrative , perhaps , of a journalistic axiom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen ( in politics , cinema , or elsewhere ) to remain newsworthy for a decade .
