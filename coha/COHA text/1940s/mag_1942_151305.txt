In spy-infested Brazil last week the Japs were beginning to take the play away from the Nazis . While busy cops hopped frantically up &; down the coast , Japs &; more Japs kept turning up , equipped with everything from illegal radio transmitters to detailed maps of Brazil 's shoreline . One raid unearthed an arsenal of 400,000 rifle cartridges , a lot of automatic riot rifles . Another raid at Sao Paulo deprived the Japs of 42 high-powered speedboats . The most sinister Jap enterprise discovered was the outfitting of a small port near Jaqui , about 90 miles southwest of Santos , with gasoline stores and a special dock suitable for submarines . Although no Axis subs have yet appeared in Brazilian waters , the Government was sure the Jaqui doings meant that they were planning visits . <P> On Ilha das Flores , Brazil 's Ellis Island in the bay of Rio de Janeiro , the Government has some 200 enemy agents interned . Most difficult of the lot are the Japs , who make a point of posing brazenly in bemedaled uniforms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ingenious disguises . Dusting a bit of sod off a Jap farmer , Brazilian police discovered what was purportedly General Yusci Tonogawa . Another Jap turned up in the uniform of the Brazilian Officers ' Reserve Corps . <P> But it was in the kitchen of a Brazilian industrialist that the strangest agent of them all was bagged . Brushing back the coarse black hair of the family cook , Brazilian cops were confronted by a captain of the Japanese Army . For five years he had been posing as a woman , and was rated a fine hand with a saucepan .
