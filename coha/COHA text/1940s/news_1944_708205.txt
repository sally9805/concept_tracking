txt ( fP ) ? The newspaper La Suisse quoted " a well-informed source " today as saying Heinrich Himmler had been appointed commander in chief of the defensive forces of Germany during Hitler 's illness . Herr Himmler already was chief of the Volkssturm. or People 's Home Guard . It was not clear whether the informant meant to convey that the Gestapo chief headed all the armed forces . A new decree ordered all German officers and noncommissioned officers who were members of the Nazi Party to " educate their men in the Nazi sense , " both on duty and off duty . Cy Reutrr LONDON , Nov. ** is the first inside-Germany story of how Gestapo Chief Heinrich I-filmier exploited the " July 20th " plot against Hitler to gain supreme power in the Reich . It comes from a man who took Part in the plot and since has managed to escape to a neutral country . He is a German Social-Democrat who was to take political control in his province if the plot succeeded . His name can not be mentioned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the German Social-Democratic Party . " I have known the author of this report for 25 years , and I have had secret visits from him outside Germany after Hitler had come to power , " a member of the Committee said . Report of Plotter Here is the report of the escaped plotter : " There were two groups concerned in the attempt to overthrow Hitler and make peace . One was a small group of officers . The other was a civilian " Committee of Action , " consisting of Social-Democrats and Trade-Unionists , exponents of both the Christian churches , Rotnan Catholics and Protestants , and pre-Nazi civil servants . I knew that Wilhelm Leuschnes , former Social-Demo // Why Plan to Kill Hitler Failed Disclosed by Escaped Plotter // cratic minister and trade union leader . was a member of this Committee ; I do not know whether Karl Friederich Gardeler , ex-Mayor of Leipzig , was . " There was only one liaison man between the officers ' group and the Committee ; he was hanged after the first trial . " The civilian Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had appointed people with local knowledge and authority who were to take charge of each German district , as well as key men who were to help them , and had asked them to decide who should be entrusted with the various administrative functions in their area at a given . time , but only on the . basis of the past record of these persons , without in-i t forming them prematurely . 1 " Since 1944 , the Committee had come to the conclusion that anti-1 lTazi and antiwar feelings among the people had become strong enough to make them support al peace government . Assassination Demanded " It was the officers ' group that ' insisted that Hitler 's assassination was a precondition of success . They explained that the great bulk of the Army , including the generals , would be ready enough to take over and suppress any countermove by the hated S.S. , but only if they first were freed from their oath of allegiance to Hitler by the action of a new determined man . " In the spring of 1944 , we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much as to make any attempt upon him hopeless . Some of us concluded from this , and from what we knew about Allied plans for Germany , that it might be better to let Hitler himself take the responsibility for ' unconditional surrender , ' and to prepare everything for taking over immediately after the capitulation . But for some reason unknown to me , the officers finally decided to act all the same . " From what happened then , it is clear to me that Himmler had succeeded in infiltrating one of his men into the officers ' group , and that he knew about the existence of the civilian Committee , though not about the people who belonged to its network . " When the attempt took place at Hitler 's headquarters , it turned out that Hitler 's double . Berger , had been substituted for him . No- I body apparently had been warned , and after Berger was killed , Stauffenberg reported to the Officers ' group in all good faith that he had succeeded in killing Hitler . " But Himmler immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group . and the password on which we were to take political action never arrived in our district . " When it became clear that Hitler had survived , we knew that Himmler had been informed about the plot . At the time we concluded he had deliberately waited for the actual attempt in order to bring us , the political opposition . out into the open . In that he failed because the arranged password did not arrive . " As a result . Himmler 's political arrests were ouite haphazard , and the Gestapo did not come to my house until a month after the attempt . By then I had made preparations for escape . " Himmler might have been more successful in tracking us if he had not arrested the officerS ' group at once , and thus given them and us some time for action . In that , however , his hand seems to have been forced by the panic among Nazi leaders , who had not been warned of what was afoot and feared the attempt might succeed . " Meanwhile . however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important reason for letting the attempt take place . Hitler Cedes Power " Under the shock of danger , he has succeeded in extracting unlimited powers from the scared Hitler . Perhaps it was the aftereffect of the explosions which 2aused Hitler 's final collapse . At any rate , it is the powers obtained then which today enable Himmler to act in the name of Hitler . " As for the opposition , I do not believe it will be able to create another nation-wide network before the final military collapse . " Even though Himmler has failed to obtain complete knowledge of the Committee.s work , he arrested and executed a sufficient number of people to paralyze the rest for the time being . But if conditions in my home district are at all typical , I can say with assurance that there still are in Germany a sufficient number of experienced men of democratic convictions who will be able and willing to build up an emergency administration under Allied control once the present reign of terror is over .
