Bendix Home Appliances Inc. , which revolutionized the washing-machine industry eleven years ago with its automatic home washer , was all ready last week to do it again . As a starter , it cut prices 7% , the first postwar reductions by a major producer in the automatic-washer field . Then it announced that it had bought Cleveland 's H. J. Rand Washing Machine Corp. , along with the rights to a " radically different " machine , which it hopes to put on the market next fall . With price cuts and new machine , Bendix hopes to fend off the score of new washers which have tried to break Bendix ' tight grip on the market . <P> Biggest difference between the present automatic washer and the new machine is the drying system . The tank of the Rand washer is lined with rubber . To dry clothes , the water and air are sucked out by a motor-driven pump , creating a vacuum which 1 ) causes the rubber to collapse , squeezing the clothing dry , and 2 ) lowers the boiling point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and passes off . <P> Barn-Bred Shaver . The new machine is the invention of scholarly , stocky James H. Rand III , 35 , son of the president of Remington Rand Inc. ( typewriters , adding machines , etc . ) . Young Rand turned down an offer to work for his father , preferring to dabble in medical research . He studied at the University of Virginia , Vienna University and the University of Berlin ( he never got a degree ) , before he set up a laboratory in a barn behind his Westport ( Conn. ) home . <P> He made it pay by branching out , developing an electric shaver , an oxygen regulator for aircraft , a plastic shoe sole . As an Army major , he worked on guided missiles during World War II . At war 's end , he set up the H. J. Rand Co. ( the initials were reversed to avoid confusion with his father ) with a capitalization of $80,000 , to develop his washer . <P> Air-Conditioned Mattress . His father did not get in the company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of it . ' ' But the washer has already paid off handsomely . All told , Bendix will pay $500,000 down , plus a royalty of $2.50 apiece on the first 100,000 washers . ( It will scale down to $1 apiece after 500,000 . ) <P> Inventor Rand is now working on another idea-a pneumatic mattress . He hopes that the mattress , now being tested in a Cleveland hospital , will eliminate bedsores . For home use , Rand inflates it with refrigerated air in summer , hot air in winter .
