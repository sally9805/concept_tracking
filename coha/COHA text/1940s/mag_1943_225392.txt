Of all postwar problems the one most thickly sown with mines , strung with barbed wire and most heavily fortified is the future of continental Europe . Last week FORTUNE , in a special supplement , fourth of a series on The United States in a New World , made a frontal assault on this intellectual Festung . Compared with much postwar thinking in the press about Europe , the proposals of FORTUNE 'S editors are direct and bold . Their goal : " to create a new Europe . We are no more ' realistic ' than that . " But readers who could remember back before Hitler , before the Depression , recognized that much of FORTUNE 'S brave new Europe was in a high old tradition , had been dreamed again &; again by Europeans themselves . A host of great Europeans , from Kant to Ortega y Gasset , had agreed that in unity lay the only European future that made sense . In 1929 , the high noon of France 's hegemony on the continent , the great Aristide Briand sent a memorandum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From 26 nations came approval - in principle . Though Britain was officially cool , Winston Churchill , then a political outcast , wrote : " Why should Europe fear unity ? As well might a man fear his own body . " Edouard Herriot , Briand 's bulldog , wrote a book called The United States of Europe ( 1930 ) . But before the movement could get anywhere , Depression and Hitler intervened . <P> A Brighter Future . Today few post war planners have picked up this prewar thread . Many of them figure that since Hitler has tried to unify Europe by force , any kind of unification must be wrong . But FORTUNE warns that if the old European state system is revived , Europe , once the center of Christian culture and world power , is " in danger of receding into its own glorious past . " FORTUNE thinks the U.S. should wish Europe a brighter future , figures that European unification would 1 ) uphold Christendom ; 2 ) eliminate some causes of war and thus prolong peace . The article shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken during the war . Specific goals : 1 ) A European Council of all continental members of the United Nations , plus Britain , Russia , the U.S. When the Council has put Europe on the track to federation and has joined a world security system , the Big Three would resign from it . <P> 2 ) A European Court and police force , to decide disputes inside Europe and prevent or localize Europe 's wars . <P> 3 ) A Bill of Rights for all Europeans , guaranteeing freedom of speech , worship , movement , etc . Individuals throughout Europe could appeal from their national courts to the European Court for enforcement of these basic rights . <P> 4 ) A series of technical agencies under the Council to knit Europe into an economic whole . Key transport would be under central control ; no more tariffs would be permitted within Europe , although each nation could still determine its own trade policy toward the rest of the world . Europe would have a central bank , investment authority , cartel policy , etc. , all aimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> These proposals involve " formidable cessions of traditional sovereignty , " but do not add up to a European federation .
