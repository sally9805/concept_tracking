txt CULLED FROM THE DRAMA MAILBAG Portrait of a Critic To the Drama Editor : A DRAMATIC critic must be , first , a man of experience in the theatre ; second , a man of integrity ( no acquaintance with drama folk can influence his judgment ) ; third , a man of courage ( and sometimes physical vigor to uphold his convictions ) ; fourth , a man of quick first ( almost infallible ) judgments , because a potential public and a producer 's purse are at stake ; fifth , a man conversant with dramatic technique to see beneath the trickery of writing to the substance , if there is any ; sixth , a man conversant with or even expert in politics , economics , history and science , so he can pronounce the verdict on plays such as " The Fifth Column " ( politics and economics ) , " There Shall Be No Night " ( politics ) , " Tobacco Road " ( sharecroppers ' economics ) , " Medicine Show " ( science ) ; seventh , a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new playwright of promise and kill the hokum of pure box-office appeal ; eighth , a man who can tell almost at a glance what is or Is not entertaining , for in the final analysis that 's the test of a good or bad play . Where is this gentleman critic ? The divergences in opinion among ? critics themselves as to the merits of a play illustrate that no such homo sapiens exists or can exist . Does n't this call for another method of electrocuting or enshrining plays in place of the critic 's firstnight verdict ? PEARL THURSCHWELL . New York , April 30 , 1940 . The Playwright To the Drama Editor : IN answer to the practically unanimous verdict that the root of the theatre 's troubles today lies in the lap of the playwright , who , it seems , is not producing " workable " scripts , has any one suggested that just possibly , even in the face of a blank wall , the playwright is not trying to turn out " workable " script in the technical sense meant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on himself if he did ? Of course , as a result , he is condemned as " experimental , " and producers must be practical , and agents , too , so why not playwrights ? Perhaps the playwright of today is being practical if only the public had a chance to demonstrate it . The spirit has a way of going before . H. D. New York , April 24 , no . Theatre Not Dead To the Drama Editor : IN his article of April 21 on the whys and wherefores of the current state of the theatre your reviewer concludes thus : " As an industry the theatre behaves as though it very much feared that it died ten years ago from wounds inflicted ten years previously . Thousands of young people do not feel that way about it . " Some seasons ago Orson Welles made the statement that " the theatre is dead . " Speaking to Whitford Kane the other day , I was again informed that " the theatre is dead , the golden age of the drama is gone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one of the older and most prominent members of that difficult profession is apt to be rather discouraging . As yet , it is safe to say that the young people interested in making the theatre their life 's work have not taken to fear and abandoned hopes and ambitions . True , It is the duty of the experienced men of the theatre , the playwrights , the actors , the producers , the critics , to warn us of its hardships and pitfalls and to do a thorough job of de-glamorization , but it is by no means their duty or even their privilege to carry on as they have been doing . They have been speaking of the theatre as if it were something dead from a dreadful disease and as if the dangerous germs still lurked about the corpse , eager to infect those who stray too near . If all the current talk should ever take effect then the theatre would surely die ; for who would there be to replace those prominent members of today , who must depart some time ? The young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them see their future in that field . It 's high time that theatre folk stop crying and ; omplaining . The patient is n't dead , he 's only ill . Now is the time to administer a medicine and encourage all the children to come in and share in the joy of the recovery , so that by this experience the children may become the doctors of tho future . . LEONA JOHNPOLL . New York , April 21 , 1940 . From the West To the Drama Editor : MAXWELL RARICK writes from this neck of the woods a plea for more . New York casts out here . It would be pleasant to have them , but why should any manager take a chance ? We ignored " Our Town " last Spring shamefully , though it had practically the original cast and the few substitutions were flawless . Rave notices made no impression ? most notices are raves here , anyway . The same play died in San Francisco , the cultural center of the Great West , where two reviewers in their Sunday columns roundly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same fate was experienced by " Of Mice and Men , " which boasted several of the New York cast , the chief substitution being Lon Chancy Jr . ( who seems to be doing all right in the film ) as Lenny . Maybe a few big names do draw here , but they have to be gods . The real trouble is the sunshine . Too many people are interested In it to care much about the theatre . Perhaps it is n't only that . They all have friends who drag them constantly to see young movie aspirants in dreadful performances at numerous little theatres . This would kill almost anybody 's love of anything . EDWARD P.
