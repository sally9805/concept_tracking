Manhattan music lovers were listening last week to another English girl who sings straight-out . <P> Two years ago , pretty Contralto Kathleen Ferrier had made a name for herself at Britain 's Glyndebourne Opera Festival - and the name was Orfeo . Last week , after her first U.S. performance of Gluck 's 187-year-old , seldom heard opera Orfeo ed Euridice , Manhattan operagoers understood why . <P> In Town Hall , Contralto Ferrier had no topnotch Glyndebourne production behind her , although she did have a familiar Euridice opposite her : U.S. Soprano Ann Ayars , who had sung the role with her in England and on records. # &134; But Conductor Thomas K. Scherman 's Little Orchestra ( 38 players ) and 40 singers from the Westminster Choir got into the graceful spirit of Gluck 's music with the overture , and stayed in it to the last gaily triumphant note . It was , however , the dramatically restrained passion of Kathleen Ferrier 's singing , in a voice that is even and full through its two-octave range , that carried the show . Few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Euridice so sumptuously sung . <P> For Kathleen Ferrier , a Lancashire lass who likes to " keep them guessing a little longer " about her age ( best guess : early 30s ) , Orfeo is " a tremendous emotional experience ... I want to cry all the time . " A pianist in her teens , she had never taken a singing lesson until 1940 , after she had entered a voice contest on a dare and won it . <P> Now on the first lap of her second U.S. tour ( she sang Mahler 's Das Lied von der Erde with the New York Philharmonic-Symphony under Bruno Walter last season ) , Kathleen finds she has little time now for anything but singing . After her U.S. tour there are two other big engagements on her schedule : 1 ) Amsterdam , where she will sing Orfeo again with San Francisco 's Pierre Monteux conducting , 2 ) the Edinburgh Festival , where her old coach , Bruno Walter , has promised to be at the piano to accompany her recital . <P> <P> * Singing a role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise in the cast : the program 's " Louisa Kinlock , " who sang the minor role of Amor , turned out to be Ethel Barrymore Colt .
