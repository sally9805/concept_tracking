Is America 's war just and righteous ? Yes , said the Presbyterian Church U.S.A. last week . No , it decided , 24 hours later . <P> Has the U.S. any business being in the war at all ? No , declared the Northern Baptists . <P> These actions highlighted the annual meetings of two great U.S. denominations last week-the Presbyterian General Assembly at Milwaukee , the Northern Baptist Convention at Cleveland . <P> Presbyterians . At Milwaukee shrewd , silver-tongued ex-Moderator Hugh Thomson Kerr of Pittsburgh caught Presbyterian pacifists off guard on the next to last day . In a silencingly eloquent speech he got the Assembly to declare that " the cause for which our nation is at war is just and righteous , and that our freedom , our culture and our historic faith are dependent upon the outcome of this conflict . " This is the nearest a major church on either side of the lines has officially come to calling World War II a holy war . <P> World War I 's aftermath has made churches much more cautious than last time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerously exposed theological salient by declaring that the Christian faith is " dependent upon the outcome of this conflict . " Few theologians of any denomination hold such a belief . They say that Christianity can lose a war , can even go underground for centuries ( as it did in the catacombs ) , but that , because of its divine origin , Christianity 's fate is never wholly dependent on such worldly things as war . <P> Next day , less than three hours before adjournment , the pacifists counterattacked . Their leader was a bluff , hearty , don't-give-up-the-ship pacifist who bears a famed fighting name : John Paul Jones . <P> Dr. Jones once dramatized Pastor Martin Niemoller 's martyrdom at the hands of the Nazis . He had himself hauled out of his Brooklyn pulpit by a posse dressed up like Gestapo agents before the eyes of his startled Brooklyn congregation . <P> Almost as dramatic were Dr. Jones 's doings at Milwaukee . Unable on his first attempt to round up the two-thirds ' majority required to get the war resolution reconsidered , he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 900-odd Commissioners . Their renewed offensive won a break-through just before adjournment . Then they succeeded in striking out Dr. Kerr 's fiery sentence , substituting the much more restrained : " We have no alternative as a nation but to engage in this war . " Nevertheless , Presbyterians are still officially committed to " pray for and work for a righteous victory . " The Presbyterians acknowledged that the U.S. was not entirely guiltless ( " Our own hands are not clean , nor our own hearts without sin " ) , called on the U.S. to abandon isolationism forever and accept " her rightful share of the responsibility for building a world order , " and declared that " our nation must be prepared . . . even at heavy sacrifice ... to enter a world society whose goal is a sovereign good which transcends national sovereignty .
