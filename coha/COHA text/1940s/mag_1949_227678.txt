I Married a Communist ( RKO Radio ) is a celluloid bullet aimed at the U.S.S.R. -a stock gangster film with Communists dubbed into the underworld roles . Its moral is addressed to the women : do n't throw over a solid union man ( acted in a pleasantly wooden way by Richard Roper ) for a ruggedly handsome executive ( Robert Ryan ) whose secretive behavior indicates that he was once a Communist agent . <P> The terrible consequences of this mistake are illustrated by Laraine Day , who flings herself into marriage with a comparative stranger . After only a few months , Laraine discovers that Ryan was once a C.P. strong-arm boy . But it is already too late : she is one of the few characters left alive in the movie . The party has not only tied up the San Francisco waterfront , but killed her husband , run a sports convertible over her brother , and pushed her prospective sister-in-law out of a window . <P> Robert Ryan 's appearance in a film ( Crossfire , The Set-Up has almost come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this movie some unexpected authenticity because he is capable of crossing black &; white traits in a role without showing his hand . The standard rackets-film types include Thomas Gomez as a mobster who operates a sort of Murder , Inc. for Stalin , and Janis Carter as a party moll with a lazily upper-class voice and a glassy manner . The movie 's one original character is a popeyed , free-lance killer ( William Talman ) with a jitterbug personality . Best scene : the free lance collecting his pay with the boyish happiness of a man who has done his first honest day 's work at a job he likes . <P> Ichabod and Mr. Toad ( Disney ; RKO Radio ) is an uneven doubleheader by Walt Disney , who has combined into one film two dissimilar literary classics : Washington Irving 's Legend of Sleepy Hollow , and Kenneth Grahame 's The Wind in the Willows . The contrast in the handling of the two unrelated stories neatly illustrates some of Disney 's outstanding vices &; virtues . <P> In Ichabod Disney gets only one chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clutching , echoing forest , with the gangling , lily-livered schoolmaster in full flight before the Headless Horseman , is a skillful blend of the hilarious and the horrible . It is Disney at his facile best . The rest of the story , dealing with quaint , legendary people , is flat and prosaic . Katrina might have popped out of a newspaper comic strip ; Brom Bones looks like a Catskill country cousin of Li'l Abner . <P> Equally disenchanting are the narration and songs by Bing Crosby , who without ever putting in a personal appearance manages to impose his familiar personality on large chunks of the film like the second take of a double exposure .
