DANGER ! KEEP OUT-Edward J. Nichols-Houghton Mifflin ( $2.50 ) . <P> To a large part of the world which reads books , the immense world which functions behind the high woven wire fences of U.S. industry is almost as cryptic as the canals on Mars . First-Novelist Edward J. Nichols makes that world so lucid , so human , so interesting , that Sinclair Lewis ' accolade seems none too generous : " I do n't know any other novel that gets so deeply into this new and battling way of living that we call Industrialism . " <P> The plant through whose intricacies Author Nichols guides the reader is an oil refinery in a suburb south of Chicago . The time is quietly crucial-1921-22-when new oil-cracking processes were first proving themselves . Author Nichols handles the change with so little progress ballyhoo , so little bitterness , so persuasively as a picture of individuals who are also industrial archetypes , that the story reaches beyond its own modesty into genuine pathos and touches the boundaries of tragicomedy . <P> Hugh Poor , superintendent of Pressure Stills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the company before 1900 . Dr. M. F. Smarts , half his age , who had a chemical Ph.D. , came in over his head as superintendent . Both men were profoundly embarrassed about the situation ; both knew it was just and inevitable . They respected and rather liked each other ; only the nervousness of General Manager Oscar Sayers made their first meeting difficult . The dialogue among these three is as perfectly calibrated as Lardner , and at least as historically illuminating . <P> George Heller was a first-rate craneman . The workers elected him to serve their interests when the Employee Representation Plan went into effect . As long as the demands were peripheral-more showers , new lockers , better air-the management came through generously . But when Heller 's electors hurried him into asking about wore pay , Sayers said , " I 'm afraid you boys do n't see the problem whole . " George became sullen and remote ; his work began to go sour . His own fireman called him a company man . When he asked about resigning from the Employee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this little trouble you had , but I expect you to stay on the committee . " And so on-no neater or fairer study of labor relations has been made . Author Nichols moves all over the plant . But the pivotal symbol of the book is Pressure Stillman Gus Hammer , in whom , as his stills and his lifetime 's skill become hopelessly outmoded , courage and dependability gradually degrade into sad , senile little tricks of sabotage , dangerously overambitious misjudgments of what a still bottom will bear . They have to pension Gus off two years before his time , and all he is good for is sitting down by the lake . <P> Author Nichols ' study of the curious marriages which men make with their jobs is gratifyingly unsentimental . He is not strong on " characters , " in the novelist 's traditional sense ; but in his quiet , exact registration of the interdependence of men , of processes , of old and new traditions , he all but convinces one that " characters , " in that traditional sense , hardly exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its essence by the world they work in.
