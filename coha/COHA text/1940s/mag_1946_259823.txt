The Army v. Hearst <P> Sirs : <P> . . . TIME March 11 quotes Brigadier General Charles T. Lanham of the Army I. &; E. section as saying : <P> " A reporter on the Hearst papers is not at liberty to attack Mr. Hearst or the Hearst policy . If he does , first , it does n't get in the papers , and second , he is fired . Why then should the staff of a soldier publication feel that it is entitled to attack the War Department ? . . . " <P> Might I remind the General that the Hearst chain , regardless of its merits , is the product of free competition . . . . On the other hand , the military paper Stars and Stripes is strictly a monopoly in its field and therefore it must serve the purpose , if it is to further democratic ideals , of all the competitors it would have under free competition . <P> <P> ( SERVICEMAN 'S NAME WITHHELD ) <P> Fort Knox , Ky . <P> <P> Gloomy , Promising <P> Sirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , it would seem the trend indicates its gloomy as well as its promising outlook . I think it can be said that the overall picture will steadily improve unless it takes a turn for the worse , in which case it will not be as hopeful as it might have been if things had developed more favorably . <P> And that I think sums up the labor-industry situation today . <P> <P> C. D. WAGONER <P> Schenectady , N.Y . <P> <P> Promotion , a Bad Word <P> Sirs : <P> Your reference to the Scholastic Sports Institute , Ltd. in the excellent article on high-school basketball TIME , April 1 contained an inadvertent but important misstatement . The Institute is a service organization for high schools ; not a " promotion group . . . . " <P> Schools can not and do not participate in or cooperate with " promotion " programs as the term is commercially used ( i.e. , to promote directly the sale of any given product or item ) . . . . <P> G. HERBERT MCCRACKEN President , Scholastic Sports Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sirs : <P> In TIME , March 25 , Winston Churchill is unjustly accused of making a " hymenopterological " analogy when he compared Russia to a community of " white ants . " <P> Of course he was referring to termites , which are neither white nor are they ants . Generally yellowish or brownish in color , they belong to the insect order Isoptera which is only remotely related to the Hymenoptera ( ants , bees , wasps ) . . . . <P> GEORGE H. BEATTY III American Entomological Society Philadelphia <P> Sirs : <P> Since TIME and Mr. Churchill have turned to entomological similes and the " soul of the white ant , " it may be just as well that it be right . . . . <P> The termitary is not ruled by a queen . She , incarcerated by her own obesity in the center of the community , is fed by the workers who bring her food and who carry away the eggs as fast as she lays them-which among certain African species may total as high as 40,000 per diem ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by all this fecundity , crawls about Her Majesty 's belly performing his time-honored functions . . . . Nor will the colony die if the queen dies . In a manner still an entomological mystery , the workers of the termites can take one of the winged species and convert her into a substitute queen .
