txt Permits for Aliens In his letter published by THE TIMES on June 30 , L. Humphrey Walz points rightly that the problem of employment of aliens is chiefly a matter of confidence . A country in war has to be suspicious against all noncitizens , especially against those who have been at any time and in any way in any connection with the enemy . Mr. WaIz suggests that certain aliens should be provided with special working permits attesting their loyalty . It does not need to be said that his procedure must be surrounded by the utmost guarantees . The alien should be charged with the burden of proving his character . Every alien who believes he could contribute to the war effort should be entitled to start the procedure . It could be entrusted to a special tribunal presided by a judge . HUGO MARX . Forest Hills , N. Y. , July 3 , 1942.
