txt Browder Charges ' Bad Faith ' Delays Opening a Second Front Earl Browder , general secretary of the Communist party of the United States , asserted at a party last night in Manhattan Center , 311 West Thirty-fourth Street , that Anglo-American relations with Soviet Russia would " deteriorate sharply " unless a second front in Western Europe was opened before the end of summer . The meeting was a special one called to hear Mr. Browder discuss the present situation . About 3,000 persons were in the hall . Mr. Browder argued that we not wait until next spring in the hope that victory can then be " bought much more cheaply , " but should land in full force now in an effort to win a quick victory and take some of the burden of land fighting off the Red Army . He held that military occupation ' by " fighting armies " was the only way nazism could be ended . Mr. Browder , who is not a millmeeting I tary expert , vigorously expressed the opinion that our troops were overwhelmingly able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . But the British and American general staffs , he charged , have acted in the role of " politicians subject to reactionary influence , " and have overruled themselves as military leaders , in which capacity , he said , they realize the need for a second front . Counting out " weakness " as a reason for not opening a second front , he said the only alternative was " bad faith . " Mr. Browder charged that " dark and sinister forces " in this country were accusing the Soviet Union of preparing a separate and negotiated peace with Hitlerite Germany in order to cover up their own plots for the same end . He also gave warning , without naming his sources of information , that the " further development of events " would soon make it clear that the United States had more to lose than Russia from lack of cooperation . Speaking on the subject , " The Quebec Conference and the Future of the Anglo-Soviet-American Coalition , " Mr. Browder declared that the world was at the crossroads and that the direction this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quebec are revealed on the field of battle , as promised by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill . He said things could not continue to drift along , but Anglo-AmericanSoviet relations must be settled soon . " Either the leading coalition of the United Nations is going to be consolidated for victory and the post-war reorganization of the world , " he warned , " or it is going to deteriorate sharply and thus place dark question marks over both victory and the perspectives of the post-war world . " " Unwilling or Unable " " The failure to realize the second front even during the beginning of the third year of coalition , " he said , " inevitably changes the I relations between the leading powers , for it poses the alternative : Either Britain and the United States are unwilling to carry any proportionate share of the fighting or they are unable to do so . Either is fatal to the concept of full coalition between the three great leading powers . " He called the argument that the Anglo - American armed forces were " too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our soldiers , General Staff and intelligence . " " America alone , " he said , " is producing more war material than Germany . We are delivering those materials in England in enormous quantities and the British themselves are producing at least half as much as Germany ; we have millions of soldiers in training for one or two years who are rusting from lack of action ; we have proved in Africa and Sicily our ability to solve all technical problems with brilliance ; we have proved everywhere any fighting has taken place , that our soldiers are second to none in the world ; the U-boats , have been mastered in the Atlanticl so that there are no longer even serious losses of our overwhelming superiority in materials  --  in short , it must be said that the last semblance of an excuse of inability to open the second front has disappeared . We are able to do it in overwhelming force any time our leaders give the word . Scores Peripheral Warfare " THE NEW YORK TIMES has been conducting an intensive campaign to convince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country and the British , by peripheral warfare and by air-bombing carried to the vital centers of Germany , have found a full substitute for the second front , are carrying our proportionate share of the fighting , and are even mainly responsible for the victories of the Red Army . This argument has significance mainly as the product of an uneasy conscience . It collapses of its own weight the moment it faces the question of how to bring a victorious ending to the war as quickly as possible , the question of whether it is not possible to shorten the war . The moment the question of time is dealt with as a vital one , which means life for millions of the population of the occupied lands , not to mention our own costs of war , then it is no longer possible to argue against the second front . There is no substitute , there is no ersatz which is ' cheaper and just as good . ' Nothing ends nazism except military occupation by fighting armies . All else is auxiliary , is peripheral warfare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of our newspapers and public commentators is much worse than the facts ! It seems calculated to convince the rest of the world that Americans are either irresponsible fools or hopeless rogues ! For example , there is all this chatter , in the attempt to cover up the glaring absence of the second front , about the second , third , fourth , fifth , sixth and seventh fronts . Behind this nonsense there is either complete ignorance of the nature of war , or there is a malicious attempt to cover up the real issue at stake . The second front is made to appear the special invention and interest of the Soviet Union . In fact , of course , as every intelligent and informed person must know , the very basis of all strategy directed toward victory in a great war has been , for over a hundred years , based upon the concept of the second front  --  the engagement of the main forces of i the enemy from two directions . No one knows this better than the British and American General Staffs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only be because as military experts they have been overruled by themselves in the capacity of politicians subject to reactionary influence . It is in suiting to the intelligence to be 1 asked to listen respectfully to the nonsense of the many fronts as the explanation why the second front , in the classical sense of military strategy , has not been opened . " The Carrot and the Club If the second front does not materialize , he said , the Anglo-American-Soviet coalition will remain , but it will be one in which relationships are regulated by the principle of " the carrot and the club , " advocation of which he attributed to William C. Bullitt , former Ambassador to Russia . " We Should have no illusions , " he added , " that Mr. Bullitt 's ' principle ' can be adopted by our country and Britain in dealing with the Soviet Union without that country taking measures to protect itself . And we should have no illusions that we can leave the Red Army to destroy Hitler practically alone in the field , while we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our strength unimpaired , dictating the peace to all and sundry including the victorious Soviet Union . That may be a beautiful Tory dream , but it simply does not correspond to the cold realities of the modern world . Mr. Bullitt 's ' carrot and club ' may turn out to be something different than it was conceived , something resembling a two-edged sword . " I submit , however , the serious suggestion that the unfortunate consequences of such a deterioration of the coalition would injure most of all the United States . Only a shallow and vulgar conception of American national interest can ignore the supreme interest which the United States has in orderly world relationships which depend , in the last analysis , upon close friendship and collaboration between the two most powerful countries in the world , our own country and the Soviet Union . Both countries have a common . positive interest in friendship and cooperation  --  but the United States is much less prepared to solve its problems in the absence of a close alliance with the Soviet Union than is that country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union halfway , as equals , if we want such a close and enduring alliance . We should understand that words carry weight in international relationships only to the degree that they are backed up by deeds . If it is not clear from the well-known facts revealed by the war that the United States has the most to lose from a weakening of the coalition , that fact will be I beyond doubt in the further devel-1 opments of events . " Attributing to Mr. Bullitt a " school of thought " that holds we must not open the second front wanted by Russia until we have defeated Japan , since we need Hitler as a club to force Stalin to give us a second front against Japan , Mr. Browder continued : " The assumption that we can ' trade ' a second front in Europe to the Soviet Union for the quid pro quo of a second front against Japan , is such an imbecility that it is a shame that it must be answered . Yet this thought operates in American politics , and must be dealt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effort to get the Soviet Union to fight the war for us in both Asia and Europe . If the Soviet leaders could conceivably be influenced by such cheap politics they would be incapable of leading a great nation , and would be poor allies for us . " Our Relations With Britain Mr. Browder said it was an illusion to believe that we could come closer to Great Britain by weakening our ties with Russia . " The opposite is true , " he added . " The weakening of one part of the Anglo - Soviet - American alliance weakens the whole structure ; the ! strengthening of one part of it ' helps to strengthen the other . " When we take a course which tends to separate us from our Soveit Ally we are destroying the foundations for all world order , taking the path of a new isolationism . " Mr. Browder accused " the reactionary camp " of trying to saddle responsibility on President Roosevelt for " all the waverings and retreats that mar our war policy , both at the battlefront and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberalism with instability " for joining in this criticism . Giving it as his " considered judgment " that the President has not surrendered to the reactionaries , Mr. Browder said : " It.is. my opinion that the President is fighting for a correct policy , and that he is fighting much better than most of his liberal critics who are so ready to cry out that he is betraying them . He is fighting in his own way , of course , and it is not the way of the Communists , nor is it the way of labor as a whole . The greatest weaknesses displayed in his leadership are weaknesses that could be remedied by more solid and consistent and energetic support from labor and all who put victory above all . Now as so many times in the past it is fatal to demand that the President must defeat the reactionaries singlehanded , without participation of the masses in the fight , and to make the President responsible for failures which are really the shortcomings of his necessary support . We are in this war to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no prospect of getting a better one , but could easily get a worse .
