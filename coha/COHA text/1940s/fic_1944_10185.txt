the hill on the horizon and extended on to include all of the world . The beginning and the end of everything was Carwell , because she had not known any other place . Her mother , brought down from Virginia and auctioned on the block at Charleston , had a suckling babe in her arms that added forty-two dollars to her price ; that was Rachel , with a memory that began at Carwell and included no other place . Even the war , which eddied all over the South , never laid its stamp very hard on this place . Once a young man , with red cheeks , blue eyes and golden-brown whiskers , dressed in a dirty blue uniform and riding a tired black horse , led a long column of tired men in blue uniforms over the lawns of Carwell  --  those were her first Yankees , the young man calling out to her , " Lassie , when 've you seen your last reb ? " She could hardly understand his nasal , clipped New Eng . land speech ; Marcus hid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that they might take Marcus , sell him down the river or something , so she ran away : and when she came back , the Yankee men were gone . As time passed , there were other Yankees , rebel troops too , the surf of the war washing first at one side of Carwell , then at the other . In one part of that surf , Gideon and Hannibal Washingtonand others disappeared  --  going off to take up the Yankeegun and fight for their freedom . The maw of the great and mysterious and yawning outside world swallowed them , and Rachel left with two children had to find faith in their return . But Gideon was vast and certain as the rising and setting of the sun ; if the other women wept , Rachel kept her eyes dry and told herself , " Gideon say he come back . " That might make for faith , but it did n't quiet her fears . If she lost Gideon , the whole world ceased to be . Other women were n't like that ; take sinfulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ; understanding that and even the desires and loneliness that prompted it , Rachel would sometimesproject a situation where she was unfaithful to Gideon , and the whole vague shape of that situation would make her smile ; for she was Gideon , Gideon was she . Even as their marriage had been , going in the night to Brother Peter for the secret ceremony , whereas so many men and women sim-P101ply gave their bodies to each other , knowing that for them marriage was for a day , a month , a year , not a bond before God but a flickering happiness before they were sold , traded , debauched . Yet she and Gideon married and swore an oathto each other . She had been happy in a way that made an expression , " Like Rachel . " If a lark sang well , it sang like Rachel . She knew her man ; God was smiling when he gave her Gideon ; she knew that . When he went away , it increased her suffering , but that too was a part of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from Gideon 's : as a child , she accepted with the other childrenthe fact that the moving branches of the trees made the wind ; when Gideon pointed out that it was quite the other way , she accepted that because Gideon said so . Gideon had to know why , always ; for him nothing existed without a reason : but inside of her the warm tides of her blood madefor reason enough . The deep , strong feelings inside of her could know things , and sometimes the knowledge was strangely exact . She did not have to know about Charleston , the Convention , the new world created , to realize that the man who went away would not be the man who returned . " Let my people go , " had meant to her having Gideon , havingher children always ; yet she sensed the sunlit horizons the phrase held for her husband . The first letters Gideon ever wrote came to her from Charleston , and at the beginningthey had to be read to her , by Brother Peter , by James Allenby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sitting at night with the other men and women , crowded into a little cabin , while Allenby taught them as he taught the children in the daytime ; but she learned slowly ; her head ached . Gideon was moving away , farther and farther . . . And then he came back and held her in his arms again , and she knew better than ever before the meaning of the phrase , " Freedom is a hard won thing . " The day after Gideon came back was Sunday , and Brother Peter held meeting on the lawn in the sunshine . In their strong voices , the people sang , " Take me by the hand , oh Lord , take me by the hand . " Brother Peter opened the Book and read from Isaiah : " Behold , the Lord God will come with a strong hand , and his arm shall rule for him : behold , his reward is with him and his work before him . He shall feed his flock like a shepherd : he shall gather his lambs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shall gently lead those that are with young . " " Amen , " the people nodded . The children shifted and twisted , and pulled each other 's hair and clucked at the dogs . Gideon sat with Rachel , Jeff , Marcus and Jenny ; but Rachel would not let him be on the grass in his fine Charleston clothes and had spread a piece of cloth underneath him  --  they were all so proud of the way he looked . " Say ye Amen , " the people nodded . Jeff 's eyes went again and again to where Ellen Jones , the blind girl , sat with old Mr. Allenby , and Gideon , noticing it , frowned . Marion Jefferson 's little girl began to cry , and he leaned over her , " Hush you , hush you now . " " Hallelujah , " the people nodded , rocking back and forth . Brother Peter said : " I will make no sermon today on account of Brother Gideon is here with us again , praise God . The good God seen fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he seen fit to reward us here with the blessing of the land , rich as milk and honey , when other black folk , they do n't eat , they do n't have a place to lay the head . The good Lord God seen fit to give us a voting and been along with Brother Gideon far off there in Charleston Town . How that was ? Brother Gideon he sat there in Convention Hall with the high and mighty folk  --  the good Lord exalted him like he done with young King David , praise God ! " " Amen , " the people said . " Brother Gideon he come back , he going to talk to us in place my usual sermon . He going to tell us how that was . Stand up , Brother Gideon . Come up here where the whole congregation can face you . " So Gideon spoke to them . As plainly as he could , he told them all that had happened , how he walked to Charleston , his fears , how he had worked as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carters , and how finally he had takenp103his seat in the Convention . For the first time , he was able to make plain to them just what the voting had meant , what lay behind the whole policy of reconstruction as ordainedby the Congress and how the process of reconstructionwould proceed , now that a new State Constitution had been created . One by one , he outlined the measures included in the Constitution , explaining them , but making clear what a great gap lay between a measure written into the Constitutionand the practical application of that measure . The Constitution said there would be universal education in the State of South Carolina , but money would have to be found , teachers trained , school buildings erected  --  and until that time they must learn in whatever way was possible . He pointed out that a measure abolishing racial discrimination did not do away with it ; that would take years and years . " And what about us , us people here ? " Gideon said . " How do we fit in with the future ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out something . Dudley Carwell lost this here place to another man , who let it go for taxes . That means , sooner or later it come up on the auction block and knock down to the highest bidder . That time come , out we go , less we do something first . I do n't know what we going to do ; I thought about it  --  give it a lot of thought , and whatever we do , we need money . Where we going to get that money , I do n't know yet . But it ai n't no reason for despair . Reason for despair is dead and gone ; it 's a bright new time we can see in front of us , bright new time comingup . " There was not the same haste here , the same press of time that Gideon had felt in Charleston . The sun set and the sun rose ; his fine clothes put away , he wore his old jeans and his old shirt . A sick sow trying to give birth to a litter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so startling now , and the slave shacks that had seemed so dreadful on his return gradually became what they were before , an old and familiar sight . Nights , he read by candle-light , mostly aloud . Marcus . Jeff , Jenny and Rachel sat and listened . Often , Allenby would come in with Ellen Jones , sometimes Brother Peter , sometimessome of the others . He read them from Whitman and Emerson , the ringing last words of old John Brown , the poems of John Greenleaf Whittier . Poetry caught their imagination , and Gideon read well ; they rocked with the rhythm and softly clapped their hands . Jeff would watch him as he read , and Gideon thought that sometime soon he would talk with the boy and discover what was behind the dark eyes and the stolid black face Marcus took life easily , impressing Allenby by his agility at learning . This , altogether , was a pause , an interval , a time when Gideon found himself disturbed by a growing impatience . Brother Peter said to him , " Recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like drawing cold , clean water out of the well . " " I remember , " Gideon nodded . " You done go off to Charleston where the Lord exalted you  --  and you come back and feel no bond with your people . " " That is n't true , " Gideon said . " Turn your face from God , Gideon , and God turns his from you . " Brother Peter added thoughtfully , somewhat sorrowfully , " You done that , Gideon  --  " " No  --  no , that 's not it , more than that . I looked at things , Brother Peter , in the only way I can , in the way of my understanding . I seen men in bondage , and not God broke the bonds but men . I seen bad men and I seen indifferent men take up guns in a good cause , because good men had their way , and out of the blood and the suffering there came something . " " And salvation , Gideon ? " " Maybe I can only see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in schools , in good laws , in good houses instead of these shacks we live in  --  " And Rachel , at night , would whisper to him desperately , " Gideon ? " " What is it ? " " Tell me you loving me , Gideon . " " Who else am I going to love ? " " Then what happen , Gideon , the change come over you ,  |p105talk  different , act different  --  what going to come of you and me ? " " Nothing , darling , nothing . " " Soon enough , you going off , you going off , Gideon  --  " " No . " " Mouth say one thing , heart say another . " " No , no , " Gideon reassured her . And Cap Holstein brought a letter from Cardozo , which said , " Have you thought about it , Gideon ? You ca n't vegetatethere while the earth is shaking . " One late afternoon , they sat down with their backs to the corncrib , their feet stretched out , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , Allenby , Andrew and Ferdinand who had both taken the name of Lincoln , chewingon pieces of straw , kicking at the dust " Look like rain . " " Maybe it do , just a wee bit . " " Old dirt can use a little rain . " " Old dirt can . " " Coming up from the west . " " Coming up mighty strong . " Gideon said , " I almost wish you 'd put in a few acres of cotton . " " Be happy if I never see a cotton boll break again . " " A sorrow crop . " " It 's the crop of this land , " Gideon said . " It 's a cash crop , and we need cash . " " You keep saying that , " Allenby observed . " Yes  --  nothing 's ours . Not the land , not even the shacks we live in . Nothing . Until now , everything was confused , no one to straighten out the records , no one to ask , what are them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to have civil administration , and then there wo n't be an acre unaccounted for . " " Who going to put us off the land , Gideon ? " " Whoever buys it . " " Ai n't a white man going to work the land alone . Man 'll need niggers. "  | " Yes . he 'll need niggers , work it on shares the way white folks did before the war . Put every acre in cotton , and have the nigger come a begging for a little piece of fatback to feed his children . Like Brother Peter say , this is a land of milk and honey now . But why ? Because we put the land into corn , into feed , because we do without cash . Just a little candle to read a book by cost cash , just a lesson book for the children cost cash . " " Gideon , wo n't the Government buy land for the niggers ? " Hannibal Washington asked . " Maybe  --  but suppose the Government does that . Government'sa thousand folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not at all . Government might say , here 's a piece of land down Georgia way , move over to it . That ai n't good . Here we lived ; here is our place , right here . We got to have this land . " " How ? " " Buy it , " Gideon said . " Work and get money , and buy the land . " Allenby said , " That would take a lot of money , Gideon . " " Sure , but things can be started . Banks lend money  --  yes , even to niggers if they see something sound , see our intendon , see a little cash of our own . Railroad 's putting a causewaythrough the swamp , asking for men at a dollar a day , nigger and white . Suppose we go down , work six or eight weeks on the railroad  --  " " And the crops ? " " Come back and take out the crops . " There was a long silence until Brother Peter said , " It 's asad thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . " But Hannibal Washington said , " Gideon 's right . " " We 'll have a meeting , " Gideon told them . But for the women it was a sad thing . Washing in the brook , they looked at Rachel , who pounded and scrubbed her clothes in silence . Change was a troublesome thing , and from now on there would be change , which though it was a part of freedom was a troublesome thing . All right to be like the children , who splashed naked in the water , shouting and laughing and screaming , feeling no shame ; but theyp107were n't like children . The swamp was heavy with malaria and men would sicken and die ; the swamp was a bewitched place . Rachel pounded and wrung the clothes in silence , when she saw Jenny fall , cried , " Jenny , Jenny , come on out , " and then said nothing when the other women looked at her so strangely .. . And Allenby asked Gideon , " Are you going to take Jeff with you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I would n't , Gideon . " " Why ? " They were in the part of the barn Allenby used as a schoolhouse , his desk a feed-box , light pouring down in broad shaft from the open loft . There was a pile of cheap paper , sharpened sticks of charcoal , a sense of children that Gideon could not define , hunger and longing in the air even though the children had gone . Gideon had been at one of the lessons and watched the old man 's incredible patience . " They are like little animals , " he had said then . " Of course , what did you expect ? But they learn . " Their eagerness was apparent enough , and Allenby was a good teacher , patient . " Why ? " Gideon asked him , wondering that he had never gotten around to that talk he intended to have with Jeff . " That 's hard to say . Perhaps because he 's like a fire . Do you know what goes on inside of him , Gideon ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can read and write already . He 's like a sponge , soakingthings in . He 's trying to soak the whole world in  --  so quickly that it makes me afraid . He knows what he wants to do , Gideon ; he wants to be a doctor . " " How do you know ? " " He told me . " " He never told me , " Gideon said . " Did you ever ask him ? " Gideon shook his head , and Allenby went on , " Did you ever look at yourself and ask things , Gideon ? Do you remember the man walking down the road to Charleston ? That was n't so long ago , but you 're not he . Do you ever ask yourselfwhat 's happening to you , what 's happening to all of us ,  |p108this  world we live in ? When you sat in the Convention and planned the change , did it ever occur to you that the change would be like birth agonies ? " " What about Jeff ? " Gideon said slowly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him into the swamp and he 'll earn a dollar a day , and I 'm not saying that would be wrong . But we have to make a beginning ; there are no schools here yet , but he could go to a school in the north ; there are schools there , in Massachusetts , that will take a colored boy , educate him , train him  --  " " I do n't know how , " Gideon said bewilderedly . " You have friends in Charleston . This Cardozo could tell you . " Just send him away ? " Gideon said . Jeff took her into the piney woods ; he told her about the many things , small and large , that surrounded her . " There 's a hop toad crossing over in front your feet . " The setting sun he told her about , " Coming like an old rose through them branches . " She could feel the wind herself , " Like someone 's hand , " she said to him . At first her fears were wrapped all around her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why and how instinctively , that Jeff gently broke through ; she lived in a deep , dark cave and there was no color , no light in there . Jeff never made a move , a step , or spoke a word to frighten this blind girl who was , for him , the most beautiful creature that had ever existed . He took her into the meadows and let her feel the texture of the meadow flowers , the meadow grass , and once he crushed a wild strawberry in her hand . Allenby lived in a shack the men fixed up for him , and he did n't mind if Jeff came there and read from his books to Ellen while she did the work in the house . From old Uncle Sexton , who had died the year before , Jeff had the swamp tales , the birds and the beasts and the reptiles who spoke to each other , living their own wonderouslives ; those too he told Ellen Jones . Rachel knew he was in love and understood his lumbering tenderness , so like Gideon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Jeff . Yet it made her sad , a blind girl ; a blindp109girl had to be cared for ; a blind girl was a burden on a man , no matter how you looked at it , and here was Jeff already almost as old as Gideon had been when he married her . A man needs a woman and a woman a man , but an equal thing , like the two halves of a scale pulling together . Allenby told her , " It will be all right Rachel , believe me . " Through the woods , half a mile from where the south fields ended , there was an acre of space that had been lumberedout , and lay open and stump-filled in the hot sun . The buzzards came there , perched on the rotting stumps and nodded at one another , and coiled garden snakes sunned themselves there . There Jeff took Ellen ; there was a place on the hot sand where they could sit with their backs against a fallen tree , and there they were wonderfully alone . For hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl who could n't see , a cloud winding across the sky , a bluejay , and in time his own dreams built up into pictures for her . Slowly , slowly and gently , something happened to her ; part of it was being in a community of friendly , warm people , the sound of voices all day , children laughing and peoplecalling to each other across a distance ; part of it was Jeff , who said to her one time , " I love you sweetly , Ellen . " Another time , when he took her in his arms , she said to him , " Do n't hurt me , Jeff , please . " And he began to realize what life was and had been to this girl . This was strange and special ; he had to know and there was no one to ask  --  and the other boys his age were hiding in the shrubbery of the creek to watch the girls when they bathed , or running after them and dragging them down to the grass " What will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever I want to do , I feel that way . " " But what ? " " Like your father , " he said ; he was the first one able to talk to her about her father . " A doctor ? " she said . He said , " That 's right . " His thoughts made pictures ; the doctor in the village was a profane , whisky-drinking man with a tobacco-stained beard ; once , when one of the women lay dying , he had heard folks talk/ing wildly and aimlessly about doctors . He thought of talking to Gideon ; his father would know , yet he could n't talk with Gideon about that , for all that he worshipped his father . He asked Allenby : " A doctor  --  what is it just ? " " A man who heals sick people . " " Sure enough ? " There was a poor old woman who lived in the brush a few miles off , practiced a sort of voodoo , made charms and sold them . " Like that ? " he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a knowledge of what makes men sick . " " What make them sick ? " So , that way , it had begun , and now , leading Ellen by the hand into the pines , he told her , " They going to send me off . " " Send you off ? Where ? " " North , maybe . Study and be a doctor . " That was incredible ; she asked him , pleadingly , who would be here when he left , and he was able to see how the darkness would close in . It was as if the thought had not occurred to him before . " I love you , " he said . " You , I love , only you . " " But you want to go ? " " I want to go , " he said , miserable . " Come someday , I 'll come back , sure enough , I swear I come back . . . " Gideon told Rachel only after he had received an answer from Cardozo . Cardozo said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to him in Charleston ; he would write to FrederickDouglass and some other friends of his in the north . Twenty-five dollars would be enough for a time , and Cardozowould arrange for Jeff to go by sea to Boston . Then Gideon told Rachel . " How far this place , Boston ? " " A thousand miles , I guess , " Gideon said . " But do you understand what it means , Rachel , a son of ours , a child born in slavery , going to Boston to study doctoring ? " Rachel nodded . " Do n't you think I wanted him with me ? " Gideon demanded.  |p111Again  , Rachel nodded . Gideon took her in his arms , " Look , baby , little baby , going to be proud of that son , going to be almighty proud of him , going to see him walking with long , glory steps . " " I know , " Rachel said . The Yankee boss , a tall , bearded man , leather-booted , mud-stained in his dank clothes , just out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You talking for these men ? " " That 's right . " " How many ? " " Twenty-two , " said Gideon . " Shovel , ax and pick . One dollar a day . Seven days a week  --  sunup to sundown . We pay on Tuesdays . " " That 's right , " Gideon nodded . The boss said , nodding at the pay shack , " Have them sign or make their mark . " Gideon , Trooper , and Ferdinand Lincoln were with the cutting gang . They went into the six- and eight-inch second growth , standing knee-deep in mud and water , and all day long their double-bladed axes cracked and gouged at the wood . For most of the black men who made up the gangs , this work on the railroad was the first free labor they had ever performed . When the Yankee company set up employmentoffices in the nearby towns to recruit gangs for construction , the local merchants shook their heads and decided , " A waste of time . Nigger wo n't work without a whip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was scandalous , they said , to pay niggers a dollar a day ; spoil them and ruin them  --  who ever heard of such a wage ? The Yankee gang bosses and engineers shrugged their shoulders and went on with the hiring . " Anyway , " the local people said , " you ca n't put a causeway through that swamp , and serve the goddam Yankeesright . " But strangely enough , the causeway was going through . When the crisscross corduroy of logs and branches sank out of sight , the engineers filled with gravel and started over . When the rains came and made the swamp a tar-like sea of mud and glue , men stood in the ooze waist deep and sank their logs by feel . When the mosquitoes bred and malariasent the shivering , fever-ridden men out to be hospitalized , the hiring signs went up again . The first casual enthusiasmthat the countryside had indulged in when they heard that the railroad was breaking south soon passed ; to the former plantation owners , overseers and slave drivers , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England formed , New England owned company that was driving a railroad through in the same heedless , incrediblemanner that Sherman had driven through to the sea . But for the black men , it was something else . For the first time , Gideon had an inkling of the relationship of labor to the whole of life and civilization . As slaves , he and his people had worked , year in and year out , having nothing , gaining nothing , the way the mule or the ox works . Now the railroad had advertised for a product they wanted to buy ; the product was labor ; Gideon and his people came and sold their labor for a dollar a day , and out of their labor was coming a conceptionand a dream , a causeway , shining steel rails , a train screaming in the night . They would go away free men , men with some money , and they in turn would buy . And they would leave behind them what their strength and sweat had built . Whether or not this right of way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know ; he did know that slaves had never worked like this , even with the lash crossing their backs . His gang cut and trimmed logs for the corduroy . Facing , two men would attack a tree , one low , one high , eight cuts on the young second growth , and then , boomed out and echoing , " Timber , timber ! " The slopping crash of the log as it hit the water , the trimming down the line , blow for blow , and then eight men lifting and tossing it onto the mule sledge . The men worked bare to the waist , their black bodies gleaming , muscles rippling . First they sang the old slave work songs ; but that was no good ; rhythms did n't fit , the pace had changed , and this was no lament . So first withoutwords , the new songs came ; they had to sing , and the first words were the simplest threads of thought  --  " Old wood do n't like my ax , old wood do n't like my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Gideon had grown soft . With the night , his whole body ached , and he had no desire , no thought except to throw himself down on the stiff barracks cot and sleep . Sleep andp113work and food , and that was all ; and he began to ask himself , " Where is learning , rest , books , anything at all but work in a life like this ? " The step from slavery bridged a whole era in civilization , but did men stop here ? The food was stew three times a day , meat , potatoes , rice , good enough if unvarying in its sameness . The men stood in line and it was ladled onto tin dishes , the only breaks in a fourteen-hour work day . The men slept in long , wooden barracks , hastily thrown up , and old army tents . Kelly , boss of number four gang , told Chief Engineer Rhead , " Give me ten gangs like mine and I 'll build you a road to hell . " And Rhead , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Hold your water , and you 'll find the equivalentright here . " Malaria came in one of its recurrent waves , and Rhead 's words were borne out ; the swamp turned into a pest-ridden oven ; day and night the mosquito swarms twisted and hummed . George Rider , one of Gideon 's people , came down with the fever , and in four days he was dead . Hannibal Washington and Brother Peter went home with the body , so that the women might see the burying and weep and take some comfort from that . No matter how it was , you paid the price . Gideon went into the gravelling gang , and then he shaved hickory for ties . And one night they heard the scream of a whistle as the work train poked forward . The swamp water sank ; the mud dried and cracked ; the heat increased but in spite of that conditions were better for work . An apron of gravel and crushed rock dressed up the crisscross corduroy , and steel rails laid a path for the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ; Hannibal Washington asked him once : " Gideon , up north , do white folk work like this ? " " Maybe some do . " " No rest , no play , no time with a woman ? " " Maybe . " " You figure it 's right , Gideon ? " " I do n't know  --  maybe I 'll find out . " The thing happened while the men were gone . Trooper had a daughter called Jessie , who was fourteen years old ,  |p114and  it happened to her . She could reconstruct the tale only brokenly , incoherently , how she had wandered out onto the old tobacco road , just walking along and daydreaming to herself , when two white men came along driving a mule cart . They had yelled at her , " Hey , you  --  you come here . " She ran across the fields and they chased her . She ran into a patch of bramble , fell , . and they pulled her out of there , tore off her clothes , and raped her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but finally let her go , and she ran home naked and half insane with fear . When Trooper heard about it , he went half mad himself ; his main reaction was violent , he wanted to kill . He said sure as hell itself , he would kill a white man . Gideon and Brother Peter reasoned with him and pleaded with him , " You going to get yourself hanged , sure as God . " " Then I will . " " What good that going to do ? " " Do some good . " Gideon said finally , with cold anger , " You 're talking like a fool  --  you 'll not do that . Seven weeks we worked in that swamp  --  what for ? Ask yourself what for , Trooper ? A man died of malaria and they took him back and buried him . We never lay back and saw the blue sky , never saw a woman , what for , ask yourself that ? " " What for ? " Trooper said dully . " For a new life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , you talk big , Gideon . Talk mighty big and loud . Go off to Charleston , high and mighty . Eat the fat of the land . Sit with fancy nigger and white folk  --  " " You fool ! I went to Charleston because I was forced to go to Charleston  --  I went afraid , small , because there was so much to be feared . There still is , yes  --  " He put his arm around Trooper and said , " Look a here , man . This is a terrible thing that happened , a sad and terrible thing , a little girl with a wound cut deep into her . But that wound going to heal , Trooper ; wounds heal . She 'll forget . Give a what-for and a how-come to our own ; you got a wife , you got other children . We come back from the swamp work-with near a thousand dollars  --  hear me , Trooper near a thousand dollars , never was that much money together in the world for a nigger . Enough money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ; sinful things to be bought high and wide and handsome for that money , calico dresses , sweet candy , Lord knows , I could go on , Trooper . That 's a temptation , but I spoke to the men and they say , All right , Gideon , put that money away , buy the land . Why for they do that , these old ignorant nigger slave men ? Why they got such a hope , such a trust in the future ? " Trooper shook his head miserably . " Let me tell you why . Future shapes up , slow , like tomorrow , like when that old sun goes down and a man ca n't sleep . Then he say to himself , never be tomorrow , never come another sunrise , going to be night forever and ever , just twisting and turning and counting all that long , lonesometime when he ca n't sleep . Well , that time 's almost gone ; tomorrow 's going to be here real soon , sure enough . All the old , evil : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lynched , a poor little nigger girl is mistreated . But they fade out . " Reading to Rachel , Gideon described the school where Jeff was studying . It seemed astonishing to him that the round , careful script should be the only projection of his son ; he tried to bridge the gap for himself , more so for Rachel and Jenny and Marcus . When Jenny and Marcus asked to know precisely where Massachusetts was , Gideon could only tell them it was a long distance , a great distance . It was a place where Yankees lived . " Only Yankees ? " " Only Yankees , I guess . " Gideon said , " Here he tells about the town , listen : Worcester is pretty and with many people , a city such a place is called . At first it is frightening but you soon are used to be living here in a city . ' " " Like Charleston ? " Marcus asked , though he had only the haziest notion of what Charleston could be like . " Yes , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading then : " There are fourteen students here at the Prebyterian Free Academy , all of them colored boys like me only most of them orphans who have no mother and father not like me . The Reverend Charles Smith and the Reverend Claudep116Southwick who is a Unitarian not a Presbyterian teaches us Reading , Writing , Sums , Latin , History and Geography  --  " " What is a Unitarian ? " Gideon did n't know ; but he could tell them what geographywas and that Latin was a language spoken hundreds of years ago by people who lived in another country . " Do they talk it now ? " Gideon was n't sure , nor could he say whether they planned to send Jeff to that country . He read : " ' We learn and sleep in a room behind the manse called the annex . The ladys committee do our meals and they have clothes for us to wear . These are clean and good clothes that were worn only a short time . We do work in return . We mow grass , wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get to cents a week for spending . I am lonely for you but happy here . Ellen tell her I miss her too ... ' Rachel wiped her eyes , but Marcus and Jenny lived life in the north with Jeff , arguing the fascinating points he brought up . " You see , " Gideon said , " how good this is for him  --  " Gideon could walk with Jeff 's dreams . In letters , he became closer to Jeff than he ever had lien in life ; in one of them , he said , " Read the books Charles Dickens writes . They will teach you much of brotherhood and of good and bad men . " Before beginning his negotiations over the land , Gideon went to see Abner Lait . Walking down the road to Abner 's place one morning , he leaned on the gate and waited for the white man to notice him . Mrs. Lait came to the door of the house , glanced at Gideon and then went back inside . Jimmy scuffled up and informed Gideon that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , nigger ? " the boy said . " Gideon Jackson . " " I seen you before . " " That 's right , " Gideon nodded . " I guess maybe you remember how I came along here last fall . " " Uh-huh . " " How old are you , boy ? " Gideon asked  | " Ten summer . " " Got any schooling ? " The boy grinned and shook his head . " Do n't want any neither . " Abner came around from the hog pen and nodded at Gideon . " Morning . " " Morning , Mr. Abner , " Gideon said . " Got a mighty nice corn stand , I see . Got a few acres of cotton , too . That 's going to be a paying crop , a good , solid cash crop , come this year . " " If I get the picking done , " Abner said. %You will . " " Well , that 's mighty nice of you to be that optimistic , " Abner said . " Maybe you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would . " Abner hitched his pants , spat , and rubbed his hands up and down his pants seat . " Hear you been working on the railroad , Gideon , " he observed . Peter came up now and Abner ' $ little six-year-old girl , hanging onto her father 's belt and staring at Gideon from a circle of red hair . " That right . " " Seems a sure enough come down for an uppity nigger who sat on the Convention . " , " Maybe it is , maybe it 's not , depending on how you look at it , " Gideon smiled . " Seems like the niggers are going to run the state . " " I would n't say that , Mr. Abner . " " You would n't ? " Gideon said , ' " Might I come on in , Mr. Abner ? I 'm sure enough dry and I 'd appreciate a glass of cold water . " " I 'll get it , " Peter cried , and ran for the well . " Come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to a broad shade tree . He squatted and Gideon let down beside him . Peter brought a tin cup of water , and Gideon drank gratefully . " Got a fine well , " he nodded . Abner said , " It stays cool . I keep it shaded . " " Nothing like fine cool water . " Abner 's wife came out on the porch again , stared at them . for a moment , and then went inside . Gideon said , " Goodp118times do n't come so often you can turn a cold shoulder on them . " " Just how you figure it . " " I figure this is going to be a better time than before the war , " Gideon answered , slowly . " Maybe it 's going to be hard hoeing for plantation people , but the small farmer 'll have a chance . Never did have a chance before . " " Uh-huh . " " Still and all , " Gideon said , plucking a stem of dry grass and chewing on it thoughtfully , " good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Abner remained silent ; he cast an eye at the sun , as if estimating the time Gideon had stayed already . His hound dog came up , sniffed at Gideon , and then stretched out . The children drifted away . Abner 's wife called from the house , " Peter  --  you come here , you ! " " Look at it this way , " Gideon said . " Bygones are bygones , but there ai n't no man here the war did n't make it almighty hard and sorrowful for . Women at home worked and sufferedand hoped ; you and me , we came back , rolled up our sleeves , and say , make something out of all this grief . Got a little seed , got an animal or two . Put in some feed and greens . Sure enough , that 's a mighty big ploughing you did for one man , corn and cotton ; just about broke your back over it , I reckon . Well , you got a crop in , crop for a man to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ploughing , Mr. Abner ? " " Who owns it ? " Abner stared at Gideon . " Damned if I know  --  damned if I care . Belonged to Dudly Carwell one time , seems he lost it to Ferguson White . They say White 's moved over to Texas . " " That 's right . The land 's gone for taxes , every foot and acre Carwell owned . " " All right , let it go . God knows , I ai n't got cash for taxes . " " This is the point , " Gideon said quietly . " The Carwell place is going to be sold at auction in Columbia sometime during October . I got that from the Federal Commissioner . It will probably go in thousand acre lots , not in smaller parcels . When it goes , where are we going to be , Mr. Abner  --  , where 're you going to be ? " 4 " Right where I am , " Abner said stolidly . " Ai n't no goddamnYankee going to tell me to get off of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that . I fought this war through  --  and what in hell did I get from it ? No sir . I 'm sitting right here on my ass , and ai n't nobody going to tell me to move ! " " Begging your pardon , Mr. Abner , just look at what you 're saying . Nobody going to tell you to get off , that 's fine , but that 's not practical . Sheriff come along , what are you going to do ? Fight the law ? You going to fight a plantationman with law and order behind him ? How can you do that ? " " I do n't need a nigger to tell me how . " " All right , but wait a minute , Mr. Abner . How you feel about niggers , that 's your business and do n't come into the argument nohow . But let me say , what ever you feel , nigger is not your enemy . " Abner told Gideon coldly , " You can damnwell get to hell out of here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth tightening . " I can get out of here . Carwell place is knocked down on the auctionblock , and then you going to hate the whole world , but what are you going to do ? I 'll tell you something , Mr. Abner , whether you want to hear it or not . Me and my people went down to work in that swamp to get money to buy land . A man without land in this here country is no better than a slave , and it do n't make much difference , Mr. Abner , if a slave 's a nigger or a white man . We got near a thousand dollars now , and if we can get a banker to give us a draft against a mortgage , we can go in there and bid for a few thousand acre lots . Mighty nice feeling that would be , going in there and bidding for your own piece of land . " Abner Lait rocked slowly on his haunches , stared at the ground , and traced curious patterns with his fingers . Minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at his large , angular hands , at the orange-colored hairs that stood out from the skin , curling like stiff wire , at the scar across his wrist that a Yankee bayonet had made . Watching him , Gideon tried to understand something of the struggle hep120was having with himself , with a lifetime of heartbreaking contradictions : whom did he hate ? what had he fought ? for what ? A man is n't the same after years of killing , marching , and trying to keep from being killed . A man can come back and get behind his plough again and feed his pigs again , but he is n't the same . " I got no money , " Abner said finally , tiredly , the edge gone from his voice . " Four dollars , sixty cents inside the house , Gideon . That 's all . " " You do n't need money , " Gideon told him . " Takers is what I want , families . Money we got is enough to make things go , or else they 'll never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored families and seven white  --  all of them living on the old acreage , all of them going to get off or be share tenants when the land is sold . Suppose we say eighty , ninety acres of land to a family , more or less , just depending . That includes a piece of scrub for burning , a piece of pasture , a piece of ploughland . Three thousand-acre lots would make out for us , give every man his piece . " " Why do you want me ? " Abner asked . " What 've I ever done for you ? I ai n't no nigger lover or goddamn Scalawag that you got to come here licking my ass . " " That 's right , " Gideon agreed . " How come , then ? " " All right , " Gideon said . " Look at it this way  --  this here South of ours got four million niggers , eight million white folk . Right here in South Carolina , the black man 's got a little edge in population . Things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ; the war killed the old way . Out of the Convention and the elections is coming a new life for this southland . What 's that going to be , Mr. Abner , that new life ? Do n't look like much from here , same rotten old shacks folks lived in before the war , same bad feeling , same hate , same dark ignorance . Where 's that new life ? Well , it do n't happen , ca n't just happen of its own wishing ; nothing does . Everything 's made . Got a railroad causeway through the swamp because men went in there and worked  --  talking did n't do it . Well , same thing here . This is a good land , this country here , a sweet land , full of milk and honey if 21you work it right . Ai n't cold , like in the Yankee country , ai n't full of sickness , like down in the river country . Got good people in it too , good white folks , good black folks  --  " " Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did they now ? War 's a sad thing , sad and wasteful . You took up a gun , I took up a gun , and in a way of speaking you and me fought against each other . Why for ? Sure the Yankees come in here , freed the niggers and maybe half the plantation owners see themselves ruined . But how many plantations are there ? Just look around you  --  everywhere the eyes rest , there 's the same old Carwell place . Me , I 'm a free man instead of just a nigger slave ; you got the same as before the war , maybe better . Never had no hope of owning your own piece before the war . Every inch of good land was part of some plantation  --  poor white could have some swamp or patch of pines to raise a crop . The Yankees left us the land , and maybe a little more hope than before . " Abner stirred the dirt with his fingers . " Go.on , " he said . " All right . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? And it wo n't be no good unless we make it for black and white the same . Ai n't no end of hate here unless the future belongs to both of us . We 're stronger to buy the land if you come in , if Max Bromly comes in , if the Carson brothers come in , if Fred McHugh comes in . " " They wo n't . " " Maybe they will , Mr. Abner . This here world 's changing . Now we got a little school up among my people . No reason why your children should n't come to school there . Some day , Government 'll come in and build a real fine school hereabouts . Nothing stopping your children going to school with mine excepting one 's white , the other 's black . " Abner shook his head . " That 's something to think about , Mr. Abner . Takes time , I 'll admit that . But there 's no reason you should n't come in on this land thing . " " 1 do n't need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It ai n't no charity to strengthen my hand . If I come top122the banker and say white folks are in this with me , then I got a so much stronger hand . " " Maybe so . " After a moment , Abner said , " How do you know they 'll sell us the land ? " " I spoke to the Yankee land agent . He says it 'll be a fair auction , gone off to the highest bidder . " " Suppose you 're lying ? " " Suppose I am , " Gideon said , and then they looked at each other , and for the first time Abner smiled . " Who 's going to do the buying ? " " My people want me to talk for them . That 's not set . We could discuss the matter . " " I 'd settle , on you . " " Then you 'll come in with us ? " Gideon asked . " I 'll come in . " " I 'd be pleased and proud , Mr. Abner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that . " Abner Lait shook hands with a Negro for the first time in his life . After two hours of talk with the Carson brothers , they came  --  in and gave Gideon sixty-five dollars to add to the fund . Max Bromly shook his head to all Gideon 's arguments ; he 'd have nothing to do with niggers , and that was the end of it . Fred McHugh came in , and so did his brother-in-law , Jake Sutter . It took three days and pleading enough with Gideon 's own people . " What for we need white folks ? " they demanded . The money was theirs . Had n't one of them died in the swamp ? Gideon told them . He repeated it over and over . At least half of them were on his side to begin , and finally the rest were persuaded . Gideon was triumphant , vibrantly triumphantfor the first time in months . Now , holding Rachel in his arms , it was like old times , so long ago . And then , four mornings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came walking up the hill with his two boys . He told Gideon , " I talked it over with Helen , and she thinks they ought to have some spelling . " The boys twisted , squealed and kicked . Abner cloutedp123them and said they 'd damnwell mind , or he 'd know why . His own shame at coming this way to niggers was something he had to stand up to , and Gideon , recognizing that , made it as easy as possible . He said , " Thank you , Mr. Abner . This is a beginning . " Abner nodded , stood around a while without saying anything , and then turned and left.  |p124How  Gideon Jackson Journeyed Far Afieldand How He Made Both a Bargainand a ChoiceCARL ROBBINS , VICE PRESIDENT OF THE FIRST NATIONAL BANKof Columbia , shook his head and told Gideon , no , he was not interested . Hardly . No , completely uninterested , smiling slightly to convey his opinion of such an affair . He had a heavy bald head , Mr. Robbins , sandy fringes of hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of his neck that seemed to support his skull . He said to Gideon , patiently : " You see , Jackson , things are not done so simply ; if they were , we should have chaos . You come to me with a thousand dollars , tell me that you represent some motley lot of niggers and white trash , squatters on the Carwell place , and suggest that I give you a draft on this bank to buy with at the public auction . That is completely fantastic . " " Not just a draft , " Gideon argued . " The same sum you advance will be a mortgage  --  " " Come now , Jackson , " Robbins interrupted . " Be sensible . These are bad times ; one hesitates about taking any mortgages , much less a mortgage on land that does n't exist . What kind of security are a few footloose niggers ? " " Please , sir , Mr. Robbins , " Gideon said , " we are not footloose . We have been on the land , this land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took out three crops on our own . If you would only come over and see the Carwell place you would think differently , I am sure . " " I 'm not used to having niggers tell me how to think , " Robbins said.  | " Mr. Robbins , sir , I did n't mean that . I am acting in good faith and honestly , believe me , sir . Our only hope is to own a few acres of land . " " I do n't see that at all , " Mr. Robbins said impatiently , looking at his watch , and nodding at the guard who was standing a little distance away , outside of the enclosure . " If you show good faith and a desire to work , whoever buys the land will keep you on to work it . As a matter of fact , I do n't approve of niggers owning land ; spoils them . I 'm sorry , Jackson , but I 'm a busy man  --  " And at that moment the guard came , took Gideon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , " It 'll be all right , Gideon , mind me  --  sure enough it 'll come out all right , " and Gideon heard hef with part of his mind , wondering how many of his people thought that way , always today and not tomorrow , the bone and marrow of slavery not being a thing that is shed overnight , like chains . He had come back miserable and beaten , and Rachel was only glad to have him home . He began , almost fiercely , " Do n't you see  --  " but broke off when Rachel said , " It 'll come out all right , you setting your mind to it , Gideon honey . " Then he began to smile , looking at her , the roundness of her , the woman of her , the flat cheeks , the small turned-up nose , the skin with just enough sheen on it to catch the light of the fire , the note in her voice as she asked , " What for you laughing at me , Gideon ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself how strange were links and reasons and the simple way of life becoming so incredibly complex  --  the fact of this woman here , his wife , whom he loved so warmly and completely at this moment , the fact of her in relation to a poor black man snatched from the African coast once so long ago , the fact of her in relation to Jeff , to himself  --  to a continuing , pulsating stream that made up humanfolk , climbing and reaching , joyous and tired . . . " What you thinking , Gideon ? " she said . Jenny climbed into his arms . Marcus lay in front of the fire . Rachel said , " Time you got bedded , Jenny . "  | Gideon asked Jenny , " What for now , pigeon ? " " Brother Fox . " " Old Brother Fox  --  I told you all I know , honest to May , " Gideon said . Jenny wanted to know , " How come he never have to do with Brother Tortoise . " " Mind as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty smart , smartest old man in the piney woods , he would n't consider Brother Tortoise . Old Tortoise got a shell so thick no one ever credit him with smartness  --  " Rachel watched Gideon , half listening to the story , as Marcus listened with half an ear , an old tale being that way , not asking too much attention , but being good for the sure and specific qualities it alwayscontained . There was a knock at the door and Rachel let James Allenby in . He sat down and said nothing until Gideon finished the story , it being a flexible thing he adjustedto Jenny 's falling asleep . The child clung to his neck as he set her down on the pallet . Marcus dozed by the fire , a comfortable , half-grown animal . Allenby said finally , after commenting on the weather outside and on how fine Rachel looked : " What happened in Columbia was to be expected , Gideon . " " I suppose so . " " Have you considered what to do now ? " " Charleston , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receptive . " Gideon said , " There 's Boston , New York , Philadel-phia  --  " " Onto the other side of nowhere , " Rachel thought , and Allenby reflected , " You 'll have that land , wo n't you , Gideon ? " " I 'll try . " " I think you will , Gideon , " the old man said . " In the way of things , after you spent that night with me in my cabin , I was sure you would go your way fully . What 's going to stop you , Gideon ? I think nothing . Only do n't do the thing for doing it ; power 's no good as of itself . Keep coming home . " " How do you mean that ? " Allenby shrugged and smiled . " I 'm an old man talking , Gideon , and maybe I talk too much . If you go up northp127and see Yankees , remember this  --  they are n't cut of a cloth . Some of them hate a black man worse than any southerner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatures with black skins . Even to southern folk who hate us , we are never alien , but as much a part of this land as the piney woods and the cotton and tobacco . Also , you will meet Yankees , a few , who have turned themselves into something strange and wonderful ; they will sit at a table with you and take your hand and the color of your skin will no longer matter . Trust those people , Gideon ; accept them for what they are . For two generations they fought to make us free because they believed in the brotherhood of man ; do n't credit the lies that you will hear about them . " Gideon nodded ; the old man leaned over , put a hand on Gideon 's knee , and said , " Do n't be too proud to take , Gideon . If there were none who took and none who gave , we would be like savages . You will go for more important things , but if some books should come your way , some paper , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gideon . " " I 'll remember , " Gideon said . Gideon 's learning continued . In Columbia he found a copy of Blackstone 's Commentaries on the Laws of England . Old and battered , he bought it for sixty cents . Anderson Clay sent him a dog-eared edition of Paine 's Rights of Man , a book which for all its vagueness , for all its being out of context with Gideon 's knowledge and experience , became for him a constant wonder , a pool of astonishment that never dried up . Allenby had some poems of Poe which he gave to Gideon , but Gideon reading them was troubled and confused . " No one is alive , " he said . He was happier with Emerson , and Allenby said , " If you could meet him , Gideon  --  " It was in early fall that Gideon came back to Charleston , came back to the Carters , who welcomed him so gladly , and then walked into the house of Francis Cardozo , who took his hand , smiling rather strangely , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'm back . "  | " A little older and a little wiser ? " " Some of each , " Gideon agreed . In Cardozo 's parlor he sat stiffly , his hands between his knees . He had a glass of wine and a few sweet cakes ; the room seemed smaller than as he remembered it , Cardozo seemed smaller too . Gideon talked slowly and carefully , and Cardozo said nothing until Gideon came to the incident of the Columbia banker . " Were you surprised , Gideon ? " " No , I was n't too surprised . I half expected that to hap-pen . " " And probably , " Cardozo reflected , " the same thing would happen here . You know , Gideon , according to his lights , Robbins was not too unfair . What can you present ? A few dollars of cash , your own word , the supposed backing of a few penniless colored and poor white families and a very vague and dream-like future . " " All futures are dreams , " Gideon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . But ca n't you see , Gideon , that this problem of land exists everywhere in the south , that it 's the single great problem upon which our future rests . How is it solved ? A year ago this past March , Thaddeus Stevensintroduced his Land-Division bill into Congress . What was his proposal ? To take the great rebel plantations , break them down , and give each freedman forty acres and fifty dollars for a homestead . Wait a moment , I want to read you precisely what Stevens himself said on the subject  --  " Cardozowent to his desk , shuffled among some papers , and then turned back to Gideon and read : " This plan would , no doubt , work a radical reorganizationin Southern institutions , habits and manners . It is intended to revolutionize their principles and feelings . This may startle feeble minds and shake weak nerves . So do all great improvements in the political and moral world . The Southern States have been despotisms , not governments of the people . It is impossible that any practical equality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole landed property . How can republican institutions , free schools , free churches , free social intercourse , exist in a mingled community of nabobs and serfs , of the owners **26;0;TOOLONG manors with lordly palaces , and the occupants of narrow huts ? " Cardozo crossed back to Gideon now and spread his hands , " All right , there it is . As Stevens puts it , we , with our Conventionand our new Constitution created a contradiction , for unless there is a free basis for all our fine proposals , what good are they ? And that basis means free , land-owning farmers instead of landless serfs and peons . " " And what do you propose ? " Gideon demanded . " I , at least , have a plan for a few of these people , a practical plan that can be made to work . " " And I have a plan for twelve million of them , " Cardozo smiled , leaning back against a chair , his hands behind him . " When Thaddeus Stevens died last month , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pointed out the way  --  make it plain to the people , enforce their power to vote , educate them , give them honest representatives , and legally in the halls of this state 's legislature and this country 's Congress , fight for legal , universal land division . " " And meanwhile the people suffer , " Gideon said . " Meanwhile , they suffer . That 's right . We alleviate their suffering all we can , but in the large overall picture of the thing , there is not much we can do . " " Still and all , " Gideon said , " I intend to buy land . If I ca n't find the money here , I 'll find it in Boston , or in New York . " For a while , Cardozo just looked at Gideon , bending back over the chair ; then he sat down ; then he said , " I 'll make a bargain with you , Gideon . I know Isaac Went , a Boston banker , an old abolitionist , and a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lets go of . I 'll give you a letter to him , and , I think , a letter that will carry some weight . I 'll also give you a letter to Frederick Douglass , who might be able to help you with this if other things fail . In return , I want your promise that you 'll stand for the state legislature at the next election . " " Suppose I let you know tomorrow , " Gideon said . " All right . Come for dinner tomorrow . " The next day , Gideon saw two Charleston bankers ; one of them was Colonel Fenton , whom he had met at the dinner Stephen Holms gave . When he saw Cardozo again , Gideon expected the question : " What happened ? " " What you thought would happen , " Gideon said , smiling a little . " At least maintain the nigger reputation for mirth . He 's happy poor and he 's happy rich . " " I 'm doing that , " Gideon said sourly . " I 'm not unhappy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone wants me , " Gideon agreed , " I 'll go in . I 'll try not to realize what I was a year ago or five years ago , " and then added , " Considering what I 've read of laws and lawmaking , I ca n't do very much worse . " " I 'm glad , Gideon , " Cardozo said . " And I ai n't  --  you see , I still talk like a swamp nigger . If I can , I 'd like to leave for the north mighty soon  --  to-morrow ? " " I suppose you could , tomorrow . " The train that carried Gideon Jackson through the night , north from Washington , D. C. , roared into a new world . That was in the exact sense of the word . All that had happened to him until now , in his thirty-seven years of life , storm and eruption , had been within the world he knew , the southland that had borne him , bred him and fed him , whipped him and gouged and cut at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he knew that land , the erosion , the darkness and ignorance , the wasted soil and life , the great feudal homes looming over the sub-strata of white peons and black slaves . And knowing that , there had been a warmth and goodnesswherever he went in the south , a sameness . In this new world , there was no sameness ; Washington , the city of giant white palaces and muddy streets , was like nothing he had ever experienced ; now he sat in a railroad car among white people who read their newspaper , spoke to one another , and neither minded nor cared that a black man was among them . In early fall , it was cold here . When it rained , the rainp131whipped angrily and savagely . When people spoke , they talked in hard , clipped , hurrying tones . " Grant , that 's a general , not a statesman . " " And what , mister , is wrong with a general being president . " " I do n't like it . " " No , maybe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't put words in my mouth , mister , I do my own thinking . " " Not much of it . " " Wheat  --  wheat 's at sixty-two . " " Is that your Herald , mister ? Mind if I read it ? " " I got two sons in Chicago , believe me , they 're doing all right . " Gideon dozed off to the sound of those voices . Later , he woke when a conductor came through , blinking off the smelly kerosine lamps . The plush seat was hard and uncomfortable ; the train stopped every few miles , jolting , starting again . People sat down next to him , then rose and left the train , a white man , a white woman , a young girl . . . And the next day , there were the Jersey flats , the sprawling , ugly city of Newark , and finally a disgorging at Jersey City with New York just across the river . On the ferry , Gideon gripped the rail and stared ; boats on the river like dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lush black smoke on the river , like charcoal marks on shiny white paper , sailing craft of all sizes , angry little tugs , strings of barges , and across the river the mass of houses  --  just pluck out a handful , and there was Charleston , another handful and there Columbia , not the queen of cities but a great , nursing mother . This was what Whitman meant ; this was the meat and blood of countlessthousands . Staring , Gideon thought of the dogged , slogging , uninspiredYankee armies that had pushed their way into the south , cut to pieces a hundred times and closing their ranks each time , clumsily , foolishly , painfully learning the art of war , and finally rocking and splitting the whole southland with their battle hymn of freedom . This was it , these small , colorless folk who crowded the ferry , the crowds on the streets , hurrying , minding their own business , the jumble , confusion , rush , roar , clatter , the goods piled high on the wharves , the dirty streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carts , wagons , vans pushing past each other in the streets , the pall of smoke over the red brickp132buildings , the clatter of tongues . The nations were here , and no one minded or noticed the tall black man . Gideon had two and a half hours between trains ; he walked from the river to the financial district ; he passed through acres of hastily erected tenements . The day was as blisteringly hot as the day before had been unnaturally cool ; this was weather to keep pace with . the city , the blustering , cocky , dirty , miserable , confident metropolis that was already becoming one of the wonders of the world . It rained and it cleared ; the streets ran with water and dirt where they were paved and became sluices of mud where they were not . Olive-skinned children sailed bits of wood in the gutters ; other children sold newspapers , running and shrieking along the sidewalks . Gideon tried to understand ; this was the city where a hundredNegroes were murdered in insane mob rage . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands , laid down their tools , gave their own money to buy uniforms and guns , and knowing nothing of war , nothing of death and slaughter , marched hundreds of miles to the south so that black men might be free . This was the city that had spawned regiment after regiment , year after year , to fight in the war  --  yet here too were the worst draft riots , the worst anti-war riots that the country had ever known . Gideon looked , wondered , and saw too much .. . Boston was more simple , more what he was used to in the way of a city . The quiet bay street where Isaac Went lived might have been a street in Charleston ; there were green trees shading it . The houses were old , and being old , unaggressive ; under the clean white paint , the woodwork was cracked and worm-eaten . In response to Gideon 's uncertain tap with the knocker , a starched maid came to the door and said politely , who would he see ? Mr. Isaac Went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , please , sir , " the maid said , a blue-eyed girl with corn-colored hair and Vermont in her voice . His hat in his hands , Gideon entered the house . Just beyond the door was a small vestibule , two facing oval-framed mahogany mirrors , four prim mahogany chairs and two small black tables , covered with Chinese lacquer and design . Wal/nut doors , opened by the maid , disclosed a fine old staircase that divided the parlor from the dining room . The rooms were large , but low-ceilinged , in contrast to the great , high ceilings of the south . Here was , Gideon saw , as clear an evidence of wealth as in Stephan Holms ' house ; yet there was a division , a split ; he was expected here , for all that they had not known of his coming . The maid said to him : " Wo n't you sit down , please , sir , and I 'll tell Mr. Went you 're here  --  what did you say your name was ? " " Gideon Jackson . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter from Mr. Francis Cardozo ? " " Uh-huh , " the maid said . " Just sit down . " Her politeness was blunt , taking him for granted . She made no effort to put him at ease , yet he was more at ease than ever before in the house of a white man . He glanced around the room , noticed the two large , comfortable wing chairs that flanked the fireplace , rejected them , took a step toward the couch that backed on the other wall , caught himself , tested a **25;28;TOOLONG chair , and then rose quickly to his feet as he heard footsteps . It was about five o'clock in the afternoonnow , and he wondered whether he had been right to call at such an hour . He stood stiffly and awkwardly as Isaac Went came into the room . Isaac Went was a small man ; standing against Gideon , the top of his bald head would just touch Gideon 's string tie . He had a sandy little mustache , a thin mouth and a pointed chin . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slippers , and a stiff white collar with a black tie . His walk was nervous ; birdlike , striking toward Gideon , he thrust out his hand and said : " What is your name ? Jackson ? Gideon Jackson ? The girl said you have a letter from somebody , could n't remember who . It 's a wonder she remembers her head 's on her shoul-ders . " " The letter , sir , is from Francis Cardozo , " Gideon said . " Cardozo ? You from the south ? " " South Carolina , " Gideon said.  | " Well , what is Cardozo doing ? Making a bigwig out of himself in politics ? Where 's the letter ? " Gideon gave it to him . Tearing it open , he read it quickly , and then looked at Gideon again . " Cardozo thinks a lot of you , " he said . " Why do n't you sit down ? Do you want a drink ? " He nodded toward one of the wing chairs , meanwhiletaking a decanter and two glasses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Went said . " Do you like sherry ? " Gideon nodded . " Yes or no , " Went shrugged . " Most black people do n't give two damns about liquor , you know . Never had a chance to get a taste for it . That 's all it is , a taste ; I used to drink whisky , now sherry . I still miss the whisky , I 'm not in good health . Will you have a cigar ? " Gideon shook his head . " All right . You do n't mind if I smoke ? No  --  I do n't give a damn if you do mind . When my wife was alive , I saved these damn things for after dinner . " He took out a long , black cigar and lit it , stretched out in the wing chair , and blew smoke at the mantle . " It says here  --  " he referred to the letter  --  " that you sat in the Convention . You must tell me about that . I could n't make anything out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land scheme of yours  --  no , save that for dinner . I want Doc Emery to hear that , he 'll be here , he 's just stupid enough to swing the balance . Tell me about the Convention now  --  " Gideon told him . With the little man , Gideon was on flat , unruffled ground . Went spat , argued , disagreed , lost his temper and yelled at Gideon ; but always as one man to another . Gideon was not a black man ; for the first time in his life , whether with colored people or white people , Gideon completely forgot the color of his skin ; for the first time in his life he was talking to a man who by a long and studied psychological process , a period of training that must have begun in his earliest childhood , had conditioned himself to racial democracy in clean and simple terms . For Went , subjectively , Gideon was a man ; he could not think otherwise , willingly or unwillingly , anymore than the average Americanp135could think in Latin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land question in debate at the Convention : " You were a fool , Jackson , you and all the rest ! Stevens was alive then ; did you consult him ? Did you ask for supportfrom Washington ? No , all by yourself you were going to remake civilization ! That 's Cardozo ! That 's all your narrow , cultured imbeciles ! Well , you missed a historic opportunity ! You could have destroyed the plantations then and there  --  you did n't  --  " When he yelled at Gideon that way , he was screaming at his equal , not at a black man , not at a white man , no courtesy here , no barriers . Later , he gave Gideon a hint as to the background of this , telling him , " I come of Abolitionist people , Mr. Jackson . Maybe I 'm not the best product they 've produced . I sat on my behind when others were in there , fightingand dying . But I did a little ; my money was useful . Did you know that old Osawatomie Brown sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for guns , for powder , for men  --  yes , he was going to march through the south to glory and sweep away slavery like the wrath of the Lord . And I gave him money and guns . That seems like a thousand years ago , does n't it , when men spoke so glibly of doing away with that rotten disease ? And then we bled ourselves dry for four years . Right there , old Brown sat , with his beard , his eyes burning  --  would you like to hear his words ? I remember his words  --  ' The Lord God has not deserted us , Mr. Went , ' he said . But we , Mr. Went , we pitiful , small , frightened , crawlingcreatures have deserted the Lord God of Hosts , the God of our fathers who led the children of Israel from the land of Egypt . ' Those were his words as nearly as I can remember them , Jackson . He was sitting where you are sitting ; Emersonwas sitting here ; I was standing . Waldo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand , Jackson , that old John Brown was a great man , a great and misunderstood man . The old man could give people the power of belief . I am not a believer ; I pride myself on my atheism even more than Doc Emery prides himself on his ; but right here , at that time , with old Osawatomie talking , I believed . God was at my right hand , my great-grandfather 's God , the grand and ter- rible old man of a God who came over to this land with the Pilgrims . Have I offended you , Mr. Jackson ? I do n't know if you 're a believer . So many black people are  --  " " You have n't offended me , " Gideon said slowly . They talked a while longer ; then Went suggested that both he and Gideon lie down for a while before dinner . " I have the habit  --  I 'm getting old . You , you 're a young man , Jackson , but you might enjoy a nap . " Gideon pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston , that Went might suggest a hotel for colored people . " Of course you 'll stay here , " Went said . Gideon objected weakly , but Went brushed his objections aside . " Douglass stays with me , " he said . " It ought to be damn well good enough for you . " Then the maid came and led Gideon upstairs to his room . " The effect , " Gideon said , " of the two years right after the war was to wake us up . The bad black codes were made to drive us straight back to slavery . You see , the planters felt they could just push away the Union victory , and they were almost right . But it wo n't happen a second time . We made a good and an honest alliance with the poor whites ; we 're united now , and we got our eyes open . We got the power , and we mean to hold onto it . " There were three of them at the dinner table , Isaac Went , the banker ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself and Boston with his pioneering in the field of abdominalsurgery ; and Gideon . Emery was a tall , lean , darkeyedman ; he wore a pointed beard and pince-nez on a black ribbon ; his appearance was deceptive , aloof , disinterested ; by blood and marriage he was related to the Lowells , the Emersons , the Lodges . He had an incisive mind , a knife-like subtle humor with which he cut at Went constantly . As Gideon noticed soon enough , he was a humane man , though parsimoniousand watchful of his humanity . Between him and Went , both widowers , there was a warm yet wary bond . Now Emery asked Gideon : " But by what means , Mr. Jackson , do you intend to hold onto the power ? " " In three ways , " Gideon said . " First , by the ballot . Therep137on every count we got the planters beat , twenty votes to every one they can find . Second , we are going to educate . All we need is ten years and in that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dr. Emery is going to be our biggest gun . The planters taught us that way back , when they made it a crime for a slave to want education , even to learn himself . Third way is the land , like I said , like I told you . We 're a planting people down there , all of us ; we ai n't  --  have not got the mills you got here . Folk live off the soil ; man with a plough in his hands has bread and shortening in his mouth . When we get the land , when we parcel it out , when we set up a nation of free farmers down there , like you got here , then we stand on our own feet and talk loud and sure . Once that land 's our own , we are not going to give it up , never . " " All right , " Went said . " Granted your utopian conception of a new south , granted all your fine dreams of schools . Do you want a tot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bad for your heart . I 'm sick of telling you that . " " All right . I have little enough heart . Granted all you say , Jackson , it adds up to a legalistic projection of the future . Business is another matter . If you were to come to me asking for charity , I might help you , I might not , depending on many things . Understand , I 'm not a soft-hearted man , not a sentimentalist . " Emery said , " I think he realizes that , Isaac . " " But you come with a fantastic scheme . Your people earned a little money ; with that money you intend to undertake a staggering land venture , a venture that would requireat least fifteen dollars of mortage money for every dollar you propose to invest . And what have I to go by , a handful of former slaves , a few poor whites , men who were recently members of the rebel army , and some good intentions . You ask me to invest money in an unknown quantity and quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to you . " He lit a cigar ; Emery leaned back and watched Gideon , smilinga little . Hopelessness made a hot , heavy load inside of Gideon ; he had come this far ; he had spent part of the money . A dollar was something you broke your heart for . A man died for a dollar . A railroad ticket cost so many dollars . How far he had gone by now  --  and how much farther could he go ? Was Cardozo right , completely ? Was all progress born out of suffering , endless suffering , a mighty burden carried by the poor for ever and ever ? " Maybe it is not reasonable , " Gideon said . " I know very little , nothing , I guess , about business . But I know cotton and I know rice . All my life I seen the cotton plant grow , seen the bolls burst , seen the black man out in the field doing the picking . Show me a cotton seed , and I 'll tell you quality . Show me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highlandor lowland . I know that , believe me . I know something else ; here you Yankees got a way of making cotton cloth . All over this New England of yours , the mills are building . How you going to spin that cotton if no one 's growing the bolls ? Want the planters to grow it ? That 'll take time ; they 'll have to break us before they grow cotton the old way . And what 's the price going to be with a few planters controlling it ? You ask what security you got from my people  --  just this . This is a cotton-hungry land , a cotton-hungry world . There ai n't been a real good cotton crop in four years now . It 's a seller 's market . Give my people the land ; let them set an example ; let them show Carolina it can be done , the way the black man showed it with rice on the sea islands before the Government turned its back on them and took away the land , the same land they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you do it , if you not afraid , then others not afraid . Give us five years of our own land , and we 'll break our backs putting in the cotton ; we 'll break our backs picking it . We 'll pay you off , every cent and with a profit . You ever seen niggers work ? If you been down the south in the old slave days , then you seen how niggers could work with a lash on their back . Well , I tell you this , I tell you a free nigger on his own land can work twice as hard . I know . Believe me , Mr. Went , I do n't come asking for charity . I ai n't too proud . Old teacher , learning the children down among my people , he said to me , Gideon , do n't be proud . The children need books , paper , if they give , takep139and do n't be proud . But this is different ; this is not charity . I pledge you that , with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never spoken so heatedly before to white men , never at such length ; embarrassed and uneasy , he sat and stared at the tablecloth . Dr. Emery studied his fingernails . The long while of silence was punctuated by the ticking of the tall grandfather clock in the corner . Then Went tapped the ash from his cigar and said : " How big is this Carwell place , Jackson ? " " Twenty-two thousand acres and some little more . " Emery whistled . Went nodded slowly . " You do n't know , " he said . " If you know , you forget . This whole god damned war is forgotten . " " In the old country , " Emery remarked , " that would be a dukedom , a nice-sized dukedom . " " What kind of land ? " " At least half is good acreage , " Gideon answered . " The rest is brushwood , piney woods , some pasturage and a piece of swamp . " " There 's a house on it , is n't there ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only on and off ; mostly they lived in Charleston . " " Do you think anyone would buy the house , buy it as a serviceable plantation house ? " Gideon shook his head . " It 's too big  --  planters who hold their land are just holding on . I do n't guess there 's that much free money in the state . " " Do you know the evaluation on the place , land and house and all ? " " The Federal agent put the prewar valuation , less slaves , at four hundred and fifty thousand dollars . At auction , they reckon it to bring five dollars an acre . They 're going to break it into twenty-two thousand-acre sections , and some will go for more and some for less . " " You say you have some thirty-odd families . Three thousand acres is a good deal . I 've known Massachusetts men to run a good farm with twenty or thirty acres and put money in the bank to boot . And this is n't the best soil in the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gideon agreed . " We got good soil . But the sections 'll be only about half working land . Men 'll clear , but that 's slow work . Then we do different kind of farming from you folks up here . You got dairy land here ; aside from the corn and greens we eat , aside from a hog or two , we got to raise a cash crop . You ca n't make money out of cotton unless you put in fifteen , twenty acres . " " How would you market it ? " " Buy an old gin , old baler , plenty of them . The railroad 's coming through , and there 'll be loading with a ten-mile haul . " " Got mules ? " " Got a few . We can buy more . " Went turned to Emery and asked , " What do you think , doc ? " " I 've seen you lose your money on worse things . " " Will you go in for a third ? " " I 'm not a banker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I  --  and you ca n't take it with you when you go . " " But it 's nice having now . " " Will you go in for a third if I guarantee ? " " If you guarantee , why do you want my third . " " I want companionship , " Went said resignedly . " This is the most damnfool thing I ever indulged in . " " You ca n't take it with you either , " Emery said . " That 's right . Look , Jackson , you 're costing me just three times what old Osawatomie did  --  and I do n't know if you 're half the man he was . All right ; I 'll give you a draft for fifteen thousand dollars . Do n't thank me . Tell us something about yourself for a change , now that 's done . " Went was more things than one man . After Emery left , he sat until far into the morning talking with Gideon ; he smoked his long black cigars , he drank too much brandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Gideon : " I 'm sixty-seven years old , son , and alone . So I look back most of the time . When I was your age , Gideon , there were still soldiers of the revolution alive ; we were a vigorous breedp141here in New England then . Think about that . We came here with the word of God and the law of God , a staff in our hands and unsmiling lips , and we scratched a living from this inhospitable and rocky land . And we did great things , Gideon ; in our meeting houses , democracy became a thing that lived and breathed . The old prophets walked with us , and in the revolution our farmers and fishermen fought with a living , just God peering over their shoulders . That 's all forgotten now , is n't it ? I 'll die soon , Emery soon , Waldo growing old , Thoreau a recluse , Whittier hidden away , Longfellowdrooling inanities  --  where is all our glory ? This Brooklyn man , Whitman , roars like a savage , but loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit and contemplate our navels . We have just a little spark left , Gideon ; old Thad Stevens was right when he left New Englandand went to Pennsylvania . But do n't forget that while we lived we did great things . It was our song , Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord . ' Well , come upstairs with me  --  " Gideon followed him ; Went walked slowly and tiredly , pausing on the landing to catch his breath . They went into a boy 's room , and Gideon saw that it had been a long time unused . There were stacks of books , notebooks , a mineral collection , two stuffed owls , a pencil drawing of a young girl , a pair of lacrosse sticks , Indian moccasins , a cleverly carved schooner model . Went said : " He died in the Wilderness , Gideon , on the second day of the battle . Afterwards , I spoke to his captain and he told me about it . The boy was wounded three times , twice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed in the battle . Gideon , maybe five hundred times I 've sat downstairs in front of the fire , trying to understand , trying to reach the boy , put myselfinside of him , and see why he should stay in a battle , cut all to pieces , bleeding , dying on his feet . Gideon , you 're a young man , but you 've got something inside you . You 'll be a leader of your people ; Gideon , understand us , do n't cut yourself off from us  --  whatever happens . " " Whatever happens , " Gideon nodded . " All right . Now I 'm going to have these books crated ,  | everything here crated . His toys and childhood books are in the attic , you can have those too  --  " " I do n't feel right about taking  --  , " Gideon began . " That 's nonsense . I have n't been in here for a year . I keep my part of the boy inside of me , I do n't need this trash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's as it should be . If I 'm in for fifteen thousand dollars , I 'll be in for twenty slates and a bin of chalk . Just tell me where to have it sent , and I 'll take care of the rest . " Gideon tried to thank him , but it was not easy . Falling asleep in the ancient four-poster bed , the roof eaves cutting down over his head to a moonlit window , Gideon thought long and wonderingly of the many things that had happened , the many faces men may have , notwithstanding the color of their skins , and the many directions in which they went . The hallelujah song was not something that roared up ; it came quietly and slowly . In logical and scientific analysis , all things were answerable but one , that being why at least a few men should find their only happiness and sustenance in a dream of brotherhood . The next day , before going on to Worcester to see Jeff , Gideon paid a visit to Dr. Emery 's dispensary . There , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , efficient scientist with two young assistants were waiting on a room and corridor packed full of patients . This was a part of Boston that reminded Gideon of New York , shacks , crumblinghouses , dirty streets , poverty , poor Irish and poor Poles and poor Italians . Emery 's dispensary was an old house , repaired , painted a clean cream throughout . Gideon sat in the examination room and watched the doctor . A boy with a sunken chest and mishapen bones " You see this , Jackson ? " The boy naked , eight years old , standing there with his arms crossed , shivering . " We do n't know what it is ; I have a dozen cases every week , only among the poor . I have my own name for it  --  Maleficio Paupertatis , sufficiently descriptive . " He ran his hand over the boy 's skin . " All right , son , put on your clothes . You see , Jackson , the ills of society have their different faces . We fought and died to free your peoplep143while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not pretty , is it , when we who call ourselves civilized can not provide free medicine , no , can not even provide a little adequate research so that we may understand this black art called medicine . Here , in this rich land , people sicken and die of starvation , of the lack of fresh air , sunlight . Charity , which is what I dispense , Jackson , is a nauseous , fungus growth , and sometimes I think my illustrious neighbors here in this town are right when they keep their pockets sewn tight . " Afterwards , Emery asked Gideon about Jeff . " You 're sure he wants to be a doctor ? " " How sure can a boy of sixteen be ? " Gideon said . " He 's a smart boy , I do n't say that just because he 's my son . " " Well , to get an education in this country is practicallyimpossible . Our medical schools do not admit that a black man can either be sick or heal the sick . In time , when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presume you 'll take care of that . However , that 's still in the future . If he passes the examination , he can be admitted to the university at Edinburgh in Scotland . " " Scotland ? " Gideon shook his head uncertainly . " That 's a long way , is n't it ? " " A good long way . Fortunately , in the old countries , they have not yet realized that a black skin makes a Oman sub-human . " " I do n't know , " Gideon said . " He 's just a boy  --  send hint 1 ) , . r off all that distance by himself . Maybe a year  --  " " At least three years , " Emery nodded , watching curiously 3 the expression of pain on the Negro 's face . Gideon , falteringlyseeking a way out , said , " Not like I could n't see what 's best , but Rachel , his mother  --  " " Then I would suggest , " Emery shrugged , " that you give up the notion of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted , " Gideon said . " It will cost some money . " Gideon said , " Come back south , I plan tovstand in the o , . elections , go to the legislature . " He hesitated . " When I sat in the convention , pay was three dollars a day . I could save maybe a dollar and fifty cents of that  --  would it be enough ? "  | Emery turned away . " It would be enough , " he replied quietly . He walked over to a window and stared out , then turned back to Gideon . " Look , Jackson , where is that boy of yours now ? " " At the Presbyterian school at Worcester . " " I know the place  --  he 'll learn to read and write and not much more . How long has he been there ? " " Four months . " " Let him stay there for six . You say he 's sixteen . He can come here in two months , and I 'll teach him more in a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to earn his keep ; I can use a boy to sweep out , wash the lab , clean the instruments and vessels . I 'm not a half baked Abolitionist like Went . If the boy is bright enough , if he shows any aptitude at all , if he 's willing to work , I can train him sufficiently in two years for him to pass the Edinburgh examinations . If he is n't  --  " Seated in the study of Reverend Charles Smith , in Worcester , Gideon repeated what Dr. Emery had said . Smith , a timid , gentle , uncertain man , said , yes , Jeff was a good boy , very good , very earnest , gave them no trouble ; but Gideon should understand that education was a slow process , a tedious process ; Gideon should remember that only a short time ago the boy could not read or write . It was true that he showed great imitative ability , that he absorbed things quickly , but medicine was a profession that required scholarshipof the highest degree . Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years he could prepare the boy for Edinburgh ? Gideon did n't know . And should one conclude that medicine was the only way in which a young man could serve his people ? What of the pulpit ? There was a spiritual side to the boy that might almost be recognized as a sign . " It 's not that I am ungrateful for all you have done , " Gideon said . Could he tell Smith what it would do to him , to Rachel not to see Jeff for five years ? Did white people understand what a child meant to a black man ? " But I want the boy to do what he has to do . " " Naturally , insofar as a boy knows . "  | " I 'll talk to him , " Gideon said . Jeff was taller than Gideon remembered him as being , taller and more like his father . Now they had been strangers for a while , they could see the resemblance in one another more easily . Gideon found himself able to talk ; he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this afternoon , they walked together . Jeff knew many people in the town , and he would introduce Gideon with pride . " This is my father . " Gideon was used to change in people ; he lived in a world of change ; he could estimate the change in Jeff without being too puzzled by it . They left the town and walked down a country road . The maples were red ; the fields were parceled out , neat and square , and the land seemed to be old and thoughtful , the red barns , the clean white houses , the rock-speckled pastures . " You like it here ? " Gideon asked . Jeff said , yes , he liked it here . Not just that the people were good to him ; it went deeper than that . The people were n't saints ; some of them called him a dirty nigger . A large number of people in town hated black men and always had . But all in all , the feeling was so different here than in the south . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him it would have been exile to live here . In a way he could n't describe , this was a cold land . " I study hard , " Jeff said . " That 's good . " And then , a while later , Gideon asked him , " Have you thought much about what you want to do  --  afterward ? " " I still want to be a doctor , " Jeff said . They came over the brow of a hill , and the sun was setting beneath them . A farmer was nudging his cows out of pasture , his dog yapping excitedly . " We 'd better turn back , " Gideon said . They walked slowly and Jeff tried to put things into words . Gideon stayed silent . " We 're new people , " Jeff said . " You know what I mean ? " Gideon nodded . " I mean , white boy does what he wants to or what 's set out for him ; he do n't have to reckon careful with service  --  "  | Again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeff went on , " here I am up here , how come ? Marcus , Carry Lincoln , all the others , they do n't come up here . In a way , I got special luck . So I figure it to be some service , something I go back with and say , See here , I got all this , I bring it back . Man 's sick , I can make him better , maybe . " Gideon said , " Reverend Smith , he 'd like you to be a preacher . That could be likened to a service . " " Maybe , " Jeff agreed . " But Brother Peter , he 's a mighty fine preacher , I think . Preaching ai n't a science . Reverend Smith , he 's a good man , a fine man , but that 's not for me . " Gideon told him about Emery , about the dispensary , about Emery 's offer and how a colored man might become a doctor at the University of Edinburgh . Jeff listened , tight , eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Emery might change his mind . Two years might not be long enough to educate Jeff , and Emery might grow weary of the whole thing . " Two years 'll be enough , " Jeff said . " I swear it will , I 'll do any work he wants me to  --  just work myself down , anything . I 'll sweep and clean that place of his out so fine it 'll shine like gold , sure enough , father , I swear I will . It ai n't no trouble for me . They say I 'm the strongest boy here in town . Old Mr. Jarvis ' cart was in the ditch , I lifted it out all myself , sure enough . That white doctor wo n't wear me down ; I 'll work all day long for him , he just lets me come there . I 'll learn , too . " They walked on ; already , Gideon was wondering how he 'd tell Rachel . He wanted to put his arm around Jeff and hold him close and warm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreasonable pride . He felt  --  if only he could sit down with Jeff , talk out all the things there were to talk about , tell him all he might tell him . Jeff said , suddenly : " You 'll let me do it , wo n't you , please ? " " I 'll let you do it , " Gideon agreed . It was almost dark now , and they hurried back to the manse . Jeff was buoyant , exhuberant ; Gideon had to take long strides to keep by his side.  |p147Before  Gideon left , he said to his son , " Jeff , boy , you and me , both of us coming out of the dark old days and remembering , we got an idea about distance being a lonely thing , calculating how far a man can walk in a day . But that 's not right ; a few days , Jeff , and you 're here or down there in Carolina . If you want me to come to you , I 'll come  --  you want to go home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll send you money to go home . " He gave Jeff the few presents he had for him . They shook hands  --  and then Gideon kissed his son , the first time in years . When Gideon came home to Carwell , a man who had accomplisheda great deal , the impossible in one sense , this was the first thing he heard about . They told him about it even as he was saying his hellos , lifting Jenny up in his arms , and then seeing beyond her the few blackened sticks that were left of the barns , and among the homes two gaunt chimneysthat were left of shacks . They were silent and unsmiling and troubled , and Rachel clung to him . " Where 's Marcus ? " he cried . But Marcus was all right , crowding through to him . " Well , what is it ? " he demanded . " When did it happen ? How ? " He had that strange , almost mystical sensation of death , and he looked around to see whether a face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington 's wife , Ada , held her new baby , born while he was gone in her arms . Life and death went on together . " Well , what happened ? " he demanded . Then Andrew Sherman 's wife , Lucy , began to cry , Andrew calming her , petting her , " There , Lucy , now  --  " and Gideon realized that her son , Jackey , nine years old , such a pride to her for his light brown skin , his unearthly beauty that was a product of the blood of two of South Carolina 's " best families , " was gone . He looked at Brother Peter who said quietly , " The Lord givith , the Lord Takith away . " " How was it ? " Gideon asked . Brother Peter told him ; sometimes , the others filled in.  | One saw one part of it ; others saw another part of it . It happenedfour days after he had gone  --  something they had heard about but never seen before in the vicinity of Carwell . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vespers , which Brother Peter had held in the barn , there being a chill in the air . That night , his text had been from Psalms , 100 , he could n't forget , " Make a joyful noise unto the Lord , all ye lands . Serve the Lord with gladness . " They came out of the barn and did n't go home immediately , but stood around in little clusters for a while , as people do after church services . Then they saw it , on the hillock beyond the west pastures , a giant burning cross , something that flared into light all in a moment , one of the women screaming out and attracting the attention of the others . Others of the women screamed and some of the children became sick with terror . Yes , Gideon could understand that , there being nothing but the soft peace of sunset first and then the grim sudden outline of the burning cross . Yet the men managed to calm the women and children soon enough . Brother Peter said , very matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether in blood or fire , could work evil to no man . Some of them took comfort from that ; others , having heard of a thing called the Ku Klux Klan , tightened their lips but kept their knowledge inside their heads . The people stood around until the cross had burned itself out , and then went home to their houses , many of them still considerably upset . " Then , " Hannibal Washington told Gideon , " I figured that something to look about , crosses do n't burn in air without someone to light them up , no sir . Seem there somethingmighty strange , and I tell Trooper , you and me , we going to look at that piece of hill . " Taking their rifles , he and Trooper circled the pasture and cut up in back of the hill . No one was there , but as they had expected , there was a charred cross made of two pieces of . blackjack pine . A strong smell of kerosene filled the air and there were wisps of hay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surmise what had happened . Someone had set up the cross , bound it , up and down with hay , soaked it withp149kerosene , and then set flame to it . It was the sort of childish , terroristic , imbecilic thing they had heard rumors of ; and being that , it puzzled and disturbed them more than any real menace would have . When they came back , the men were waiting up for them . Hannibal Washington reported what they had found . Allenby said , " We have n't had our share of the scum and trash of the south here at Carwell . " About that time , Abner Lait arrived with the Carson brothers , Frank and Leslie , all of them armed , calling out , " Hello  --  hello , there , " as they came through the darkness . They had seen the cross from their places and had come over to find out just what it was about . " Probably ai n't nothing , " Hannibal Washington said . " Or maybe that Klan . Or maybe some fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that any folks round about here would do a damnfool thing like that , " Abner Lait said . After that , there was much talk and much discussion about what should be done . Actually , there was nothing to be done . They wanted to know whether Gideon could see that , telling him the tale . What could be done in the face of such nonsense ? Someone suggested a guard , and someone else , quite rightly , said that they were law-abiding folk living in a civilized land . They could n't be setting guards every night . " You can see that , Gideon ? " Brother Peter said uncertainlynow . " You were right , " Gideon nodded . " What happened then ? " Well , they went to bed , later than usual , but finally all of them slept . When the thing happened , it must have been long after midnight . Each had the same story to tell now , of being awakened by the thunder of hoofs . Some of the women , screaming , woke out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed in bed . Hannibal Washington , Andrew Sherman , Ferdinand Lincoln , and Trooper had all left loaded rifles near their beds , and when they heard the hoofs they seized the guns and ran outside . So did Brother Peter , Allenby , and a dozen more of the men , but none of those were armed . All of them reported the same sequence of events  --  mounted men in white shrouds , twelve of them , armed , although they did not notice that at first . At least half of the men carried pitch-soaked torches , and by the time the men emerged the old , dry barn was already on fire , the hay hissing and giving out long tongues of flame . The cows and the mules were screaming with terror . Trooper admitted to firing first ; he said that when he heard the mules screaming , he shot at one of the white-shrouded men without thinking , but he was certain , and so were the others , that he hit nothing  --  he had just fired in red anger . At that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men wheeled their horses , tossed the torches they had left at the shacks , fired a volley of shots at the people , and rode off . " You must understand , Gideon , " Allenby said now , " the sort of cowardly scum they were . The one shot sent them away . With all their white shirts , their dirty night raiding , their burning crosses , they were afraid once they knew we were armed . They scampered off like rabbits , and it was n't until a while later that we noticed Jackey Sherman stretched out in the dark with a bullet between his eyes . One of the wild shots they fired  --  we were trying to put out the fire , save the stock , and the child did n't make a sound , he could n't , poor thing . " Lucy Sherman began to sob again . Brother Peter told Gideon what was left to tell . The dead child took the heart out of their fire fighting ; they saved the stock , but the barns and two of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lait , Fred McHugh , his son , Jake Sutter , and the Carson brothers . Hannibal told how Abner Lait looked at the dead child and cursed the way they had never heard a man curse before . " You see , Gideon , " he explained , " that take away what we been thinking , God help us , we been thinking any white men , maybe them . Then they come and we know it ai n't them . Ca n't bring back child 's life , but that help . " " And what have you done about it ? " Gideon demanded , his voice so even and bitter that it seemed like another man speaking.  |p151Allenby  said , " What was there to do , Gideon ? The next day , Abner Lait took his mule and rode off to town . We heard afterwards that he demanded something from the sheriff  --  and the sheriff just laughed at him . You know a man called Jason Hugar , he used to run slaves in the old days ? " " I know him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the local Klan leader . Abner accused him , and they say he called Abner a dirty nigger lover . They had a fight , and the story goes that Abner half killed him . There was a mob , and Abner pulled his gun and said , yes , who would be first ? Charley Kent , who was in Abner 's company in the war stood by him , and then Abner got on his mule and came back . The next day , Hannibalhitched up the cart , and we both went to Columbia and spoke to Major Shelton there . " " And what did Shelton say ? " " He said that measures would be taken . That 's an expression , Gideon  --  measures will be taken . " In Columbia , Major Shelton said the same to Gideon , " You can rest assured that proper measures are being taken . " Shelton was a tall , hard , narrow-eyed man , nine years out of West Point , young enough to feel resentful of a fate that kept him here in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him bitterness from the people he respectedand sympathy only from those he dispised " What are those proper measures ? " Gideon demanded . " Military measures which I am neither inclined nor obligedto discuss with you . Your complaint was filed ; action is being taken . " " And meanwhile , a dead child stays dead , and it ends there . " " No , of course it does n't end there , " Shelton said impatiently . " Do n't try to put words in my mouth , Mr. Jackson . As I understand the case , it was purely accidental that the child was killed . Nevertheless , we are doing all we can to apprehend the criminals . " " Accidental ! " Gideon said . " Accidental that those whiterobedbandits burned the cross , raided our village , set the barns on fire , barns which are not ours , Major Shelton , but at that moment the property of the Government of the United States . What kind of an accident was that ? " " I 'm sorry " Mighty sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Investigated and questioned men like Jason Hugar ? Have you done that ? " " Do n't shout at me , Jackson ? I 'm not going to run in circlesfor every nigger who comes in here , screaming for pro-tection ! " Gideon said evenly , " Look , sir . I am not losing my temper , I will not . I am not asking for anything , I talk about our right . Congress of this here country provided military protectionfor this district until civil law established . Either you provide that protection , or we will . I fought in the war too ; I was master sergeant with the Black Fifty-Fourth Massuchusetts  --  no we was not a ditch-digging , wall-building nigger work-batallion ; we was free niggers and escaped slaves from this state and we fought nine separate battles , and eight of every ten men in our regiment was a casualty . Do you remember how we attacked Fort Wagner , leaving on the works four hundred dead from our regiment and our Colonel Shaw among them , and the rebels cut up his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because he , a white gentleman , a saintly white gentleman led a regiment of niggers ? And do you remember our song  --  if you fought in this state , you heard men sing , The gates of heaven opened wide for Colonel Shaw . I do n't like to talk about them things ; they gone and in the past , the bad past . But I say , if you do n't provide that protection , we will provide it ourselves . " His voice hard , Major Shelton said , " I will put down any disturbance , whether originated by whites or blacks . " " And we will protect ourselves , " Gideon said . Afterwards , back at Carwell , Gideon called a meeting of all the men , black and white together , and told them : " You know what came of my trip to the north . Isaac Went , a Boston banker , gave me a draft of fifteen thousand dollars on him . We are going to buy the land  --  and we are going to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I propose that we stand for our rights , that we organize our own militia , that we drill once each week until the need for that goes . " There was a good deal of discussion . Frank Carson said , matter-of-factly , that he did not like the idea of drilling under a nigger . He had ridden with Stuart , and he was uneasyabout this whole business . Gideon proposed Fred McHugh , who had been a non-commissioned officer through the war , as drill-master . It was voted , and he accepted . In turn , he chose Hannibal Washington and Abner Lait to help him . Allenby questioned the legality of the matter , but Gideon pointed out that they were merely exercising their Constitutionalright to bear arms ; that they had borne arms , all of them since the war , and that their organized drilling would merely serve notice to night-shirted gangs that they were not fair picking . To a degree , he was right , for after that a long time passed before the Klan again rode in the vicinity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gideon about Jeff , and Gideon told her how it would be , the time with Dr. Emery , the chance that Jeff would go to Edinburgh . Edinburgh , across the world and at the beginning of nowhere . Gideon realized now that the girl loved Jeff ; why was he shut to so many things ? She said , " Maybe five years , " and there was a tone in her voice that made an end of everything . " Maybe , " Gideon agreed , and then tried to make it as gentle for her as he could , but thinking to himself all the time , why did Jeff let it go on ? He thought so much and often of Jeff now , when he saw the way the other boys skylarked with the girls , when he saw Marcus shooting up like a reed . Ellen would come and sit with Rachel . They had a lot to talk about . Rachel had said little to Gideon about Jeff . " It is best for him , no doubting it , " Gideon had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take hold of himself , realized that a tide of things was carrying him farther and farther from Rachel , and try to be extra gentle , extra sweet , show her many little attentions . She would say , " Gideon , Gideon , do n't pay no worry to me. "  | " I love you , Rachel honey . " But he even said if differently now ; the change in him was with his speech , his bearing , his thoughts , his actions . When Rachel realized that some of the other women were talking about her and Gideon , she made more of a point than ever of Gideon 's accomplishments . She could tell the other women that there was no one in the world like Gideon , fan their jealousy , their admiration or envy ; but she could n't tell it to herself in the same terms . She would wake at night and lie stiff and still by Gideon 's side for hours . Once , something told him she was up , and he asked her : " What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then sleep . " After a while , she said , " Jeff 's gone . God , I want another baby . " " We got two fine boys and a girl , " Gideon said . " I want a baby . I 'm empty inside . " " Just like the good God plans it , " Gideon whispered . " Child comes or it does n't  --  you ca n't help that . " " You do n't believe in God , " Rachel said . " Honey  --  honey . " " Child comes to them that have love . " Gideon said , " I love you , baby , believe me , with all my heart . " " Jeff 's gone , " Rachel said miserably . " He gone , that 's all . " It was decided that Abner Lait , Gideon , and James Allenbywould appear at the auction to buy the land . The men delegated to Gideon their power of attorney , and Daniel Greene , a Yankee lawyer who had recently set up in Columbiaprocured Gideon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time that was left , they went over the tracing , dividingit and subdividing it . They had no clear idea about how the government surveyors would apportion the land into thousand-acre lots , but they tried to provide for all eventualities . For a whole week , Gideon , together with Abner and Frank Carson , roamed over the twenty-two thousand acres of Carwell land . They found places they had not known thep155existence of . Frank Carson pointed out that in one spot , where the creek dropped a full seven feet , a waterwheel could be cheaply built and they could grind their own hominy . They found a fine stand of sycamore , high and leafy , a good place for living . When Abner Lait , pointing to a **25;55;TOOLONG of swamp , said that was something they would do well to stay away from , Gideon asked closer investigation . The swamp trees were second growth and would make easy clearing ; the ground was black muck , wonderfullyfertile , oozing decay . " Two fine crops of rice a year , " Gideon said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece of rice paddy . " Gideon , full of dreams now , showed how a causeway through the swamp would bring them within four miles of the railroad . Frank Carson , straining the muck through his fingers , grinned and said , " Going to build me a fine house , right up there on the sycamore hillock . Set in rice and get me a clean cash crop instead of that goddamn cotton . Goddamn , I never seen a man to get no happiness out of cotton . " " I 'll plant cotton , " Gideon said . " This is going to be a hungry country for cotton . I 'm going to watch the bolls break and say , they 're my own . " " Never seen lowlandwithout malaria , " Abner said . They went on ; they walked through miles of piney woods . They emerged on hillocks , with land sweeping below them like a never-ending ocean . Frank Carson , regarding it strangely , said in a quiet voice , " I seen the land before , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my granddaddy must have done , just coming out here slow and easy , a gun over one shoulder and a fry over the other . " That way , in the time that was left , they saw all the land they could pace over . The crops were being harvested ; it was a good year that was ebbing out in this fall of 1868 . The yellow ears of corn were stacked in the temporary cribs that had been built ; a rough shed housed their fodder and stock . There was a market for the cotton the white men put in , and one night the people heard the shrill whistle of the first through freight train . On the twenty-second of October , Gideon , Abner Lait , and James Allenby stabled their cart in Columbia and joined the crowd for the big public auction . Daniel Greene , who had been hired to handle their bids , waved to Gideon as he darted in and out of the crowd ; he wore a checked suit , a white straw hat , and a fat black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See you , Jackson , see you ! " His pockets were full of tracings and titles . People had come in from all over the state for the auction . Recently , it had rained , and the muddy streets of the state capital were crowded with carts , carriages , and saddle-horses . The auctioneer 's pulpit had been set up on the steps of the Capitol , a huge , half-completed stone pile that stood on a hilltop and overlooked the countryside for miles in every direction . On improvised billboards , maps of the tax-forfeitedholdings were poste , with the section-cuttings marked out in bright crayon lines . In the packed crowds around them were people of every description , Charleston gentlemen , Negro fieldhands , Yankee speculators , up-country farmers , plantation owners from as far as New Orleans and Texas ; there were representatives of Morgan and representatives of the Unitarian Church , and there were representativs of two English land companies . One hundred and sixteen thousand acres were going on sale . Gideon , his sleeve plucked , turned and looking into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his ease , gently-polite , Holms was gracious as Gideon introduced Abner Lait and James Allenby . Here to buy , Gideon ? " Holms asked him . That s right . " " Then we 're both on the same mission . I 'm representing Dudley Carvell , Colonel Fenton , and to a degree , myself . " " Are you interested in the Carvell place ? " Gideon asked , as offhandedly as he could . " Possibly  --  or any other piece as good . Dudley does n't want the house , it always has been a white elephant . I heard you were negotiating a loan in Charleston ? " " I made the loan in Boston , " Gideon said . " Did you ? Well , let 's try not to bid against one another  --  enoughstrangers for that . Was n't it your folks , Gideon , that had some trouble recently with  --  "  | " With the Klan , " Gideon said . " Scum and damn white trash , " Holms said . " Glad to have met you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When he had walked on , Lait remarked , " That kind I know , Gideon . Was he an officer ? " " I think so . " -A mighty fine man . How many niggers did he have in the old days ? I reckon he 'd put a knife in his mother 's back . " A little while later , the auction started , and from there on , 4or Gideon and his two friends as well as for h , ost of the others in the crowd , all was hopeless confusion " two auctioneersspelling each other , screaming out , " Block four , Chipden , twenty-two , north and south , two dollars governmentminimum , eight hundred , two dollars , two dollars , two dollars , going , going , going , up to three , three dollars tens ' cents , I got fifteen cents , fifteen cents ? ' ' Greene , breathless , his cigar bent and lifeless , found Gideon and said , " Look at r this tracing ! I got the section breakdown , twenty-three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The house " b goes separate with two hundred acres ! Government min- t , D imum is dollar an acre ! " Gideon , Lait , and Allenby pulled out of the crowd andpeered at the tracing . " Pick three , " Greene said , " and then ecru ' " " successive alternates through the rest . " " How do you mean ? " " Well , the best land first . I mark that Ai . " They pointedout the three most desirable sections . " Nov from there on , in case we lose out at first  --  " Gideon and Abner , weighing pros and cons quickly , numbered the remaining twenty blocks . " Top price five dollars ? " " Five dollars , " Gideon nodded . " But get it cheaper if you can . " " The best , " Greene nodded , plunging back into the crowd . The voice of the auctioneer droned on . From all over , men shouted their bids . Land agents fought their way to the platform . The bidding had started at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still going on , and the Carwell place had not yet come up . Then , at two o'clock , the first Carwell section was put on the block . Gideon saw Greene close to the pulpit , shouting his bids , but Gideon could not keep pace with what was going on . But by five , it was over ; thelawyer , exhausted , crumpled but a triumphant grin on his face , pushed out of the crowd , " Got them ! " " Which ones ? " " Two of them Ai . " The lawyer spread the battered tracing ' on the board walk , knelt down , Gideon , Abner , and Allenby grouped over him . " These two , four dollars straight . " Lait whooped with joy , leaping up and down , slapping his thighs . " God damn , God damn , Gideon ! Look at that ! That 's thehill with the sycamores ! That 's them flats , meaty , like a gal 's ass ! " Gideon got down on his knees next to Greene , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your number four alternate  --  funny , the bidding on thatwent up to five . You sure you know these places ? " " Hell , yes , we know them ! " Abner said . " All right  --  that 's good piece , damn good piece . " " Seven thousand three hundred for the first two pieces  --  that 's a bargain , Gideon , a damn good bargain , that 's giving away the land . Four thousand , seven hundred and fifty dollars for number three . You got land there . Near three thousand acres  --  " They came home triumphantly , Old James Allenby driving the mules , Gideon and Abner singing drunkenly , " Green grow the lilacs , so wet with the dew , I 'm lonely , my darling , and thinking of you . " Abner had invested two dollars in a jug of corn , and he and Gideon had polished it down over the whole long ride from Columbia . Gideon was n't a good drinker ; he drank rarely and gingerly . Threequarters of the jug had gone into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same state of glory . Gideon roared out to the people , " We are tomorrow , we are , sure enough ! " Allenby told the story of what had happened . Rachel , laughing at Gideon , put him to bed ; he dragged her - down with him , while she protested , " Gideon , have some shame . " But it was like old times , Gideon laughing and sing- ing out in his deep bass voice , until at last he fell asleep.  | , The next day , Brother Peter held a special meeting . A As told Gideon , " Forget the Lord God , brother , be not humblebut brazen and loud , then sure enough the Lord God he " ' going to forget you . " And his voice more gentle , " Gideon , you going to lead the people , then you got a dispensation , and you got to know that . Know it humbly , Gideon . When you do good , you do good on account the people put their trust in you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't disappoint me , Gideon . You a knowing man , climbing high up a ladder . Look down , Gideon , just look down . " " I 'm sorry , " Gideon said . " Believe me , Brother Peter , I'msorry . " Sure , Gideon , you sorry , you got a big heart . But hear me , Gideon , look inside yourself and find God . Find God and give him your trust . " " Your way is your way , " Gideon said softly . " Mine is mine . Brother Peter , there 's no man in this world I reverence more than you , believe me . " " I got to believe you , Gideon , " Brother Peter said softly . At the meeting , he said , " My text is from Numbers , We came into the land whither Thou sentest us , and surely it flowed with milk and honey ; and this is the fruit of it. ; IHe preached his sermon slowly and pointedly ; in a place of the landless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , forherever a black man bought piece of land , a thousand eyes would be uponhim . " Use it well , ' Brother Peter said . After the meeting , the dividing of the land began . It had to be done immediately if they were to move from here , take over their pieces , and build some sort of shelter against the winter . Gideon had thought it would be difficult , but not so difficult as this , men fighting , arguing , protesting , weighing each one 's piece against the others ' , jealous , name-calling , the white hunching together against the black , the black instinctively putting shoulder to shoulder against the white , until at last Gideon roared : " Stop it  --  damn you all for fools ! We 've come this far alreadyand now you 're ready to cut each other 's throats . We are going to pick one man , vote for him , and let him portion out the land . Now who 's it going to be ? "  |p16o  They wanted Gideon , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the voting , Brother Peterwon by three votes . Trooper asked him , " Who going to pick your land ? " and Brother Teter answered , " Whatever 's left  --  it do n't matter . " Then they looked at each other shamefacedly , grinning sheepishly . It went better after that . In the way of things , it was natural and easy that thisshould be the time for voting again and that they should notcontemplate the thousand matters that had wrought a changein them . A year ago , they had walked in to the voting with their guns , but things were different now . The land had changed ; the people had chan the future overtook them , nd they were part of it now : hey went into town together rly on the first Tuesday in November , black men and white men together . There was a nip of coming winter in the air . Dead leaves scurried across the dusty road . ti't'he black men were going to vote Republican , solid , but Abner Laitsaid that when all was said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daddy had ; his granddaddy had ; he did n't like to upset a thing like that . Yet all of them , together , walkedinto town for the voting . V P163How Gideon Jackson Went to See a Tired ManGIDEON TOOK OUT HIS WATCH AND LOOKED AT IT . IT WAStwenty minutes to three , and he had been waiting since two o'clock . He had hoped to have his appointment and be at the station by five-sixteen , to meet Jeff , who was coming down from New York . Well , likely enough , he would still make the station in time to meet Jeff . Actually , he had very little to say here and now , and what he said , he was sure , would not be to too much effect . Outside , on this bleak February day , it was snowing , Washington snow , large wet flakes that folded against the window panes and then dissolved into globs of cold moisture that wriggled down the glass . Gideon relaxed into the leather chair and folded his hands in his lap . At this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a long , long sleep such as he had not known for many months  --  just to sleep and be free of thinking for a time , and then to wake up , fresh and eager . But how eager could a man be at forty-five ? Gideon shook his head and smiled and began to think about Jeff ; it was better to think of Jeff than to think about other things ; Jeff was reality . Jeff would swing off the train and come striding toward him . Or would he ? Perhaps he would just stand , uncertainly , and look at Gideon , and perhaps there would be nothing at all between them . But that was impossible . Seven years do not make such a difference . But seven years in Edinburgh , seven years during which a frightened black boy becomes a doctor of medicine ; seven such years are something to be considered . Gideon , recalling that day when Dr. Emery put the matter up to him , smiled wryly . What had Emery been thinking ? P164What , indeed , had he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it cost much money ? That was so long ago  --  eight years ? Nine years ? He would have liked to have known Emery better , to have known Went better ; now they were both of them dead . He recreated the picture of himself standing in the dispensary , talking with Emery , watching the shivering , naked ricket-stricken child , and that way memory after memory came back , until the flow of pictures was dissolvedby the striking of a tall grandfather clock in the corner , one , two , three . He must have been sleeping . The secretary , standing in front of him , said : " The president will see you now , Mr. Jackson . " Gideon rose , blinked his eyes , and followed the secretary to the office . Grant was sitting behind his desk , hunched , tired , red-eyed , a man defeated and lost and regarding the long , empty years before him without hope and without pleasure . He nodded and said : " Sit down , Gideon , " and then told his secretary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If Senator Gordon  --  " " Tell him to go to hell ! I wo n't talk to him , do you understand ? I do n't want to be interrupted ! " The door closed behind the secretary . The president said to Gideon , " Do you want a cigar ? No  --  I forgot , you do n't smoke . You do n't mind if I do ? " He bit off the end of his cigar , struck a match , puffed long and deeply . Gideon watched him , but the presidentavoided his look . Age had come suddenly and ruthlessly on Ulysses Simpson Grant ; his eyes were sunken , his beard streaked with gray . Even his smoking was in short , jagged , nervous motions . When he spoke , he barked at Gideon : " I know what you 're going to say . " " Then why did you let me come here and say it ? " Gideon asked gently . " Why ? " Grant looked at him with sudden bewilderment , and Gideon felt a complete and understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was understood by so few , loved by so few , used by so many , hated by so many , despised by so many , this man who by fate and circumstance had been elevated to a remote and hopeless glory .   " Why come here ? " Grant said dully . " Because you are still president of these United States , " Gideon answered carefully . " Because you are my friend and I am yours  --  " " So I have friends ? " " And because , " Gideon went on , " when all is said and done , this is your country and you love it as few men I know do . You love it in a way that I understand , in a manner that is beyond the conception of the cheating , lying , small men who have done their best to wreck it . Do you remember Everett Hale 's story , The Man Without a Country ? Do you remember how Philip Nolan came to love and understand his native land ? " Grant smiled ruefully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gideon ? " " No  --  I 'm going to talk to you about this land . I 'm going to talk because it 's the last chance I 'll have to talk to a president of the United States . I 've tried for two weeks to see you " I was busy , Gideon . " " You were busy , Mr. President , " Gideon said . " That is all , you were busy . God help us , we have so many pat phrases , busy , occupied , a thousand things to do . Why are n't our enemies busy ? Why ? " " I 've heard all that , " Grant said coldly . " And you do n't want to hear it again . At this time , you 'd like me to go . Well , perhaps I can put it differently . Leaving aside what the newspapers have said and what the histories will say of the eight years during which you were president , what is the truth ? " " Say it  --  I was used ! " Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , Mr. President , this is  --  well it 's our country ; let 's use the schoolboy phrases , nothing else will do now . This is our native land . We fought for this . We lived for this , what men died at Gettysburg for . We do n't exist apart from it , or from each other . It is all bound together , making one . What is a country ? " Gideon hesitated , then went on , " What is the United States of America ? Is it a dream , an ideal , a piece of paper called the Constitution , a coalition ? Promoters ? Grafters ? Robber barons ? Is it Morgan or Jay Gould or Senator Gordon ? Or is it a man standing out in the street and looking at the White House ? " Now Gideon spoke more haltingly , " Is it the Episcopal Church or the Congregational Church ? Is it a prayer or a fool 's fancy or fifty million men ? It it Congress ? All the years I sat in CongressI thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to fools like Peterson and heroes like Sumner . Or is it you and me , and bound into us , and inseparable from us  --  because what we are is America , what we have , what we 've done , what we have dreamed ! " Grant 's cigar had gone out . Clenched between his stubby fingers , it made a focus for his eyes . Slowly , automatically , he shook his head . " I 'm through , Gideon . " " You 're president . " " For a few more days  --  " " For long enough to hit them ! " Grant said wearily , " But I do n't know , Gideon . I 'm tired . I 'm finished . I want to go home and rest . I 've been dragged through sewers . I want to go home and forget . " " You wo n't forget , " Gideon said . " Maybe . I 'm no Solomon ; I 'm no God of judgement . I did n't ask for this . I won battles because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that make me a president ? Did that fit me to play their dirty , rotten game of politics ? " " There are still battles , " Gideon said . " When you do n't know the enemy ? When you do n't know who fights on your own side ? " " And when Hayes slides into that chair where you 're sitting , his legs knee-deep in blood , will you rest easy ? " " God damn it , Gideon , where are your facts ? Hayes is a Republican ; so am I ; so are you . He was legally elected president . I am sick of the calamity howlers . Life will go on ; so will this country  --  " " All right , " Gideon said , and rose . " Are you going ? " " Yes . " " What were you going to say ? " " Why bother ? It wo n't matter . "   " God damn you , say it ! " Grant growled . " Say it and get it done ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a prima donna and say it . " " All right , " Gideon nodded . " There was a deal . " " Where is your proof ? " " I have the proof , sir , " Gideon said quietly . " Will you listen to me for a while ? " " I 've been listening . " Grant lit his cigar . Gideon sat down again . The clock on Grant 's desk showed a quarter of four . " I 'll start a while back , " Gideon began . Outside , it still snowed , fat , lazy white flakes that melted on the window panes . It was growing dark in the president 's office . The single lamp on his desk threw a circle of yellow light , and as the darkness increased his face became more tired , more indistinguishable . The smoke from his cigar drifted into the light , twisting , turning , running up the chimney of the lamp . " You remember the South Carolina Convention ? " Gideon said . " That was nine years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of speaking , that began the reconstruction . I served on the Convention . Two years later , I served a term in the State Senate , and five years ago I came to Congress . In the light of that , I think I can speak with some knowledge of what happened . The word reconstruction , which they use for all that happened in the south since 1868 , is too pat . It is meaningless . It was not essentially a problem of reconstruction , not even a problem of readmission of the rebel states into the Union . All this I have said in the House ; I have said it over and over , these five years past . I am saying it now , I suppose , for the record  --  for I think that this is the last time for a long while to come that a Negro representativeof his people will sit in the office of the president of the United States . " Grant knocked the ashes off his cigar ; now his face was lost in the shadow . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has it meant ? Why has it been destroyed ? I ask you because you 're the only man in the country who can bring it back to life  --    68 and doing so , save this country untold suffering and misery in the future . " " Go on , Gideon , " Grant said . " Reconstruction was the beginning of the new and the death of the old . The plantation slave system , a feudal thing , abhorrent to the nature of this country , only a few years ago set out to rule and conquer this nation . It had to be destroyedor it would destroy democracy . It was destroyed , and in the course of that destruction my people were freed . Do you want me to go on ? " " Go on , " Grant said . " Very well . Out of that terrible war came reconstruction  --  essentially a test for democracy , a test of whether freed Ne groes and freed whites  --  for the poor white was as much a slave before the war as the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that test was taken and proven , that democracy worked in the south  --  with all its faults , its blunders , its boasting extravagances , its fools and loud-mouthswithall that , it worked ! For the first time in the history of this nation , black men and white men together built a democracyin the south . You have the proof , the schools , the farms , the just courts , a whole literate , eager generation . But this was not done easily and never done completely ; the planters organized their army , white-shirted scum by the thousands . They have n't given up . You yourself , Mr. President , said that only the presence of Union troops in the south preserves order . I tell you , the day Rutherford B. Hayes takes office , those troops will be withdrawn  --  and the Klan will strike . In one form or another , it will strike everywhere , and there will be terror such as this land never knew , murder and destruction and burning and looting , until every vestige of that democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back a hundred years , and for generations to come men will suffer and die  --  " Grant 's voice came wearily , as from a great distance . " Evenif I accepted what you say , Gideon , and I do n't accept it , what is the alternative ? To keep troops in the south forever ? " " Not forever . But for ten years more  --  to give us a chanceto bring to manhood a whole new generation , black menP169and white men who have learned to work together , to stand together . Then no force on earth will take away from us what we have built . " " I do n't accept that , Gideon . I do n't accept your accusationof Hayes . I do n't accept your fanciful notion of the power of the Klan . This is 1877 . " " You wanted proof , " Gideon said . " I have the proof . " He took some papers out of his pocket , spread them on the desk in the lamplight . " Here are the statistics of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hayes ' popular vote is 4,036,000 . That is the first lie ; I say that half a million Negroes and whites in the south who voted the Republican ticket had their votes destroyed , miscounted , tampered with . No , I ca n't prove that ; I 'll prove other things later . Actually , it does not matter ; these two men , Tilden and Hayes , are both corrupt , sad commentaries on what our presidency has sunk to . They are Tweedlededum and Tweedledee , cut out of the same cloth . " " So far , " Grant said , " you are making groundless accusations . I wo n't listen to much more of that , Gideon . " " You said you would listen . I 'll give you the proof ; first let me establish my facts . Even our Congress , which fears democracyand the people more than anything on earth , will let me establish my facts when I rise to speak . I 'll be quick with it . My boy , whom I have n't seen for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train from New York ; I assure you I 'll be through before then . " The room was quite dark now outside of the circle of yellow light . " Go on , " Grant said . " We come to the electoral votes , 184 for Tilden , the Democrat , for Hayes , the Republican i 66 undisputed votes . With one more vote , Tilden could be president , but Hayes claimed South Carolina , Louisiana and Florida , enough to give him the 185 that would make him president . And Hayes was right  --  those votes belonged to him ; as I said , they were tampered with , destroyed . What was the situation ? A DemocraticHouse , a Republican Senate , one to give the election to Tilden , the other to Hayes , and the whole country screamingof the second Civil War , of a southern march on Wash- ington . Mr. President , did you believe that ? Did you believe there was a difference between these two corrupt men ? ' Grant said , " God damn you , Gideon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to the proof now , Mr. President . Let me give you the proof , and then I 'll go . I think we are both through . As you said , you have only a few days to be president , and I have not too much time either . " " Go on , " Grant muttered . " Yes  --  evidently our southern Democrats knew that the two men were of a stripe . They threw Tilden aside ; he would be too much trouble ; they had risked a civil war once and they had failed ; they were not prepared to risk it again . They made their deal with Hayes . He could have South Carolina , Florida , Louisiana  --  and to make the deal certain , Oregon , too . In return , he would give them a very small and inconsequentialthing , control of South Carolina and Louisiana , and withdrawal of Union troops from the south . Such a small matter to stand between a man and the presidency , between the Republican party , Lincoln 's party and power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of Mr. Hayes ' friends , Stanley Matthews and Charles Foster . It gives the gist of certain talks they had with Senator John B. Gordon of Georgia and the Kentucky Congressman , Mr. J. Young Brown . This is an exact copy , made and brought to me by a colored servant of Mr. Foster ; I will swear to that . I 'll read it : " Referring to the conversation we had with you yesterdayin which Governor Hayes ' policy as to the status of certainsouthern states was discussed , we desire to say that we can assure you in the strongest possible manner of our great desire to have him adopt such a policy as will give the people of the States of South Carolina and Louisiana the right to control their own affairs in their own way , subject only to the Constitution of the United States and the laws made in pursuance thereof , and to say further that from an acquaintance with and knowledge of Governor Hayes and his views , .  |p171we  have the most complete confidence that such will be the policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. President . " A long silence then ; and finally Grant asked tonelessly , " Why do n't you bring it before the House ? " " Because I have n't the original , because while I am prepared to swear on a stack of Bibles that this is the truth , I can not bring evidence ; I can not set the word of a poor old colored servant against that of the president elect of the United States . If I were to stand up in the House and say to them what I just said to you , ten of our cultured Bourbon members would be screaming that this damned , insolent , lying nigger be lynched . " " Why should I believe you ? " " Because the whole future of this country is at stake . Becausewhen we fought our revolution , when we fought our civil war , we were moving down a proud and shining road , what my people call a hallelujah road . We were moving with all the good men who lived behind us , and we had our faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President ? Now we 're going to leave that road ; from here on , we turn our face to darkness . For how long , Mr. President ? How many shall have to die before we can call this a government of the people , by them and for them ? " " It 's not as bad as that  --  " Grant began . " But it is ! " Grant stood up , lifting himself from his chair with both hands , leaning over into the lamplight , staring at Gideon , and then pushing away from the table and striding angrily across the room . " That 's all ? " Gideon asked . " What can I do ? " Grant demanded , whirling on him . " Even if your insane , fairy-tale of a story were true , what in God 's name could I do ? " " Everything . You 're still president . Give this to the people . Hold a press conference tomorrow ; there are papers with guts enough to print this . Let Hayes prove the accusation false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people look at it . They 'll know what to do . We 're not a bad people , P172here in America ; we 're not an ignorant people . We 've moved the world before ; we 've done bad things , but we 've done more good things . Go before Congress and demand the truth  --  " Grant shook his head . " Gideon  --  " " Are you afraid ? " Gideon cried . " What have you to lose ? Those who remember the days when you led them to victory , they 'll support you . And the others  --  " Gideon 's voice trailed away . He gathered up the papers and put them in his pocket . " All right . I 'll go now . " After Gideon had left , long after , Grant sat at his desk , face sunk in his hands , staring at the closed door . It was late when Gideon got to the station . The train had already pulled in . On the station platform , he saw Jeff , a tall young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between two carpets bags with his hands in his pockets . It was not a question of memory , not a question of change ; the two of them looked at each other and knew each other , and though each was many years older , each was more like the other . They approached and shook hands . Gideon swallowed ; Jeff smiled slowly , letting one hand grasp his father 's arm . " You 're bigger than I remember , " he said . " And you too , " Gideon nodded . " You recognized me . " " Yes , I 'm glad you 're back , Jeff . " " I 'm glad to be back , " Jeff said . Gideon bent for the bags . " I 'll carry them , " Jeff said . " One apiece . " " All right , " Jeff smiled , looking curiously at Gideon , measuringhim from top to bottom , casually , but in such a way as to make Gideon feel that he was being appraised . They stood shoulder to shoulder , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after this long time to adjust his movements , his thoughts , his desires to the other . They walked down the length of the platform , through the station , and Jeff said , with a sense of guilt and omission , " How isP173mother ?  --  " Fine , " Gideon said . " We all get older . " " You look no older , " Jeff said . Gideon had a cab waiting for them ; they climbed into it , filling the tight space with their long-limbed bodies . Snow flurried around like a white fisherman 's net . " I , thought of Washington as a warm place , " Jeff said . " I 've never been here before  --  " " No , you have n't , " Gideon realized , thinking of all the years this sprawling , boastfulcity on the Potomac had been a part of his life . The horse set off with an easy clack , clack of shod hoofs . " I 've had a small house here these past two years , " Gideon said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gideon said . " I think she 's happierat Carwell . " " You still call it that , Carwell ? " " Carwell ? " Gideon seemed a little puzzled . " Yes , we never thought of calling it anything else . Have you room ? " The bags were tight against their knees . " It 's quite comfortable , " Jeff said . " You must be hungry ? " " I am , a little . " " We 'll have dinner at home , just the two of us . I did n't ( f ask anyone else . " Jeff wondered why his father said that . The house Gideon had was a small , white-frame five-room building . A withered old Negro woman kept it clean and prepared his meals . Gideon called her Mother Joan . " Mother Joan , " he said , " This is my son , Jeff . " " That 's a fine big boy , Mr. Jackson . You a proud man . " " Mighty proud , " Gideon said . They had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , greens , and buttered grits . These are the first grits in how long  --  ? " Jeff smiled . " You would n't have them in Scotland , " Gideon remembered . Of course , he could n't expect it to all come flooding out at once , the moment the two of them met ; it would come bit by bit , as they broke down all the things between them . Seven years was a long time ; they even spoke differently , Jeff 's speech harder than Gideon 's , with a curious foreign sound . I/ Jeff said , " I worked for a year with Dr. Kendrick . He had a grant dispensary at the mines . It was good experience  --  bad accidents , crushed arms or legs , burns , lacerations , and the household things too  --  croup , mumps , little things that are so difficult to get onto . " " White people ? " " I was the only Negro in the county . That makes a dif-ference . " " There was no feeling ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity . They 're not a complicated people , and their fears and suspicions were basic things . You could put your finger on them and clear them away . " They went into Gideon 's study , a small , book-filled room that he also used as an office . They sat with their feet stretched out to the glowing coal grate , and they talked of many things . It was easier now ; Jeff was able to say : " You know , I 'm terribly proud . " " Of what ? " " Your being in Congress . I do n't know how to say it , but that 's a wonderful thing . " Gideon 's eyes were thoughtful . " It 's a matter of circumstance . People are made . The things were present to make me into this or that , and those things operated . " Jeff asked him about the election , and slowly at first , and then with more passion , Gideon told him , traced the whole sequence of events in the last eight years , told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And I 've failed , " Gideon said . " Are you sure ? Can a thing come to an end that way , suddenly , the way a bomb explodes ? Do things happen that way ? " " Not suddenly , " Gideon said . " This has been going on for a long time . More than eight years ago , the Klan raided our people at Carwell . That was a clumsy thing , a frightened thing . They burned the barns and killed one little boy . But they were beginning then , as far back as that . From the very first , they planned to destroy us . The war was hardly over before the same people who made it set about planning forP175the next war , a different one this time , armies that ride in the night , underground organization , intimidation , threats , terror . Now their preparation has been completed ; they 're ready . " " I ca n't believe it . " " If I could only think that I was wrong , " Gideon said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are you going to do ? " " I do n't know yet ; I want to think about it . In any case , I 'm going home . I want to be with them . " Jeff nodded . " That 's right for me , I think , " Gideon pointed out . " But what is right for me is not necessarily right for you . Do you see , Jeff ? " " What are you driving at ? " " I 'll be leaving in the next few days , " Gideon said . " I do n't want you to go back with me . There is no reason for you to come with me . If things are all right in the spring  --  " " What on earth are you talking about ? " Jeff wanted to know . Gideon shook his head . " Easy , Jeff . Now you listen to me . There was a time when you 'd listen to me . " He stood up for a moment , rubbed his long-fingered hands together , leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair abruptly . He sat there silent , staring ahead of him , the glow from the fire picking out highlights on his long , high-ridged face . Jeff looked at him , noticing how the large , full mouth was set , how weary and red-rimmed the deep-sunk eyes were . The man was older , older than forty-five years , older than logic and reason . The broad shoulders that Jeff had so often seen as a child , bared to the hot sun , sweat-covered , immensely powerful , bound over as they were with layer upon layer of flat , hard muscle , were now bent and slack . The short , kinky hair that covered his head like a tight cap , was streaked through with grey . Jeff did n't know him ; Jeff had never known him ; a boy of fifteen is malleable clay . Nine years had stretched Jeff but broken nothing ; he had learned , grown , expanded , been hurt and healed his hurt ; he had . found a God in science , and under a microscope a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many cells , wonderfully placed together . P176All the world was reason . A man called Darwin had cleared away the haze that covered the uncounted ages beyond man . A broken leg was set in such and such a fashion , whether the skin that enveloped it was black or white . In a lonely cabin on the moors , he had delivered a child of a white woman , slapped it , and watched it scream with the wonderful agony of birth . The world was an understandable place , a planet twisting through nothingness , gently enveloped with a protectiveskin of atmosphere . Men were evil because they did not know , but a man who dedicated his life to knowing , in the scientific nature of the word , could have no fears . That was how it had been with him ; but what had been with his father ? He remembered the tall field-hand who set off for Charleston , a delegate walking to a convention , a crushed stovepipe hat on his head , a bright checked handkerchief hanging out of his pocket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisting agony had made that second man ? And what convulsions within Gideon Jackson made the third man , the fourth man ?  --  the man of whom Dr. Emery had said , " That is greatness in the essential of the word , Jeff , remember . There are no scientific definitions . When you come to the end of logic , think about him . " Jeff thought about him now , the man who sat in the State Senate of South Carolina , the man who served in the Congress of the United States and in answer to a Georgia representative made that statementthat every child in the country knew : " Yes , as the gentlemen from Georgia says , I was a slave only a short while past . And today , as a free man , I answer him in the Congress of this nation . That , gentlemen , is the American testament , my American testament . I need not indulgein patriotic sentiments . The fact that I stand here defines the country I serve better than any words a man could speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scottish magazines ; a member of parliament spoke it in Commons ; over that statement , a fierce debate raged in the French Chamber for three hours ; and in Germany , Hungary and Russia , underground revolutionary groups of workingmen had translated that statement , printed and circulated thousands of copies of it . P 177/Now , looking at Gideon , Jeff felt a complex of pity , of pride and longing , a desire to come close to this m n , his father , to understand him and be understood by him ; yet a sense of himself as an individual , a man beyond Gideon , ahead of Gideon . " I ' 11 listen to you , " he said . " Whatever I have to do , I 'll still listen to you " " I 'm going back , " Gideon explained , speaking slowly , softly , " because I belong there . The nature of all I am , Jeff , S son , all I have been , is in people . I come from them ; I have my strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I have a gift ; I could learn , I could talk , I could soak in things , but there was nothing in me that was n't a part of them . I want to go back to them because that will give me the greatest happiness , and the nature of a man , Jeff , is to seek his happiness , whether in the small things he does or in the large ones . " With you , it is different . You have been away for a long time . You have been schooled and trained , and today you are . doctor . A doctor is like a fine book ; it has a. use outside ofe toil and effort that went into creating it I have no use outside of the things that went into me ; you have . No matter how bad things are , when the need comes , my people will ' find other Gideon Jacksons . With you , if is different . I can talk to you as a man ; that makes me proud and happy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the last time in many years a black man would talk to the president , I was saying something I believed . I also believe there will be few black men trained as you are in the years to come . Stay here ; you can live in this house . There will be enough broken bodies to heal . It would be waste if you came back with me . " When Gideon finished talking , they sat in silence for severalminutes . Jeff knocked out his pipe , filled it again , took a coal from the fire with the tongs and dropped it onto the soft , fragrant tobacco . Gideon poured some wine . Looking about the room finally , Jeff said , " This is a nice room , a warm room . I should like to read some of the books . " Gideon nodded.  | " I always think of reading books tomorrow , when there 's time . Somehow , there 's never time today . " " There 's time , " Gideon said . " Tell me , " Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think it might happen , would you fight ? " " I do n't know , " Gideon said . " Marcus wrote me that when someone is sick , you call old Doc Leed . Sometimes he comes , sometimes he does n't . " " Mostly , he comes . " " He wo n't come anymore now , " Jeff said . " If what you tell me is true , he wo n't come anymore now . " Jeff rose and walked to the window , wiping away the moisture that had gathered inside the pane . " It 's still snowing , " he remarked . " It 's funny , being away so long , I never learned to love any other place . Did Allenby ever show you any of the letters I sent him , to read to Ellen ? " Gideon shook his head . " The old man died last month . I thought you knew . " " I did n't know , " Jeff said . " I 'm going back with you , father . " jC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a sort of compromise between an attitude of leaving for good and a half-formed hope that he might be back for the spring session . He would find himself thinking that Jeff was right , that a world simply could not explode like a bombshell . He left the house as it was , telling Mother Joan to keep things in order . He attended a meeting of the Ways and Means Committee , and found himself hotly engaged in the discussion of a law pertaining to railroad land grants . Well , a man was so constituted ; he went ahead with habitual things ; he dressed and ate and shaved and slept . And one day , soon after Jeff came home , he was told by his secretary that Senator Stephan Holms would like to see him . " You may tell Senator Holms , " Gideon said , " that I am completely engaged . I have only a few days before I leave Washington , and I am making no appointments . " The secretary came back and said that Senator Holms was quite insistent. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let him come in . " Holms entered ; Gideon made no effort to rise , no offer of his hand . Smiling , Holms smoothed the nap of his hat , took off his coat carefully , set his stick and gloves on a corner of Gideon 's desk , and seated himself . " What do you want ? " Gideon said . " I wanted to see you , Gideon , because we are both civilized human beings , because on that basis we can discuss things , because in a world full of fools , idiots , small men , and little minds , you and I can certainly discuss the truth , recognize it , and make our peace with it without passion . " " You believe that , do n't you ? " Gideon asked , watching the slim , delicate man who sat so completely at his ease , so immaculatein his clothes , so unruffled in his demeanor , the smooth , shiny , faintly-yellow skin untouched by the years , the ascetic face both an enigma and an invitation , reacting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was a productof civilization ; after a fashion , too , this was a truthful man , a strangely truthful and direct man in a strangely untruthfuland indirect world . Yet at this moment , Gideon felt for him a loathing such as he had never felt for a living being , loathing , disgust , hatred ; Gideon Jackson , who in all his life , as a slave and as a free man , had reacted from hatred , who had tried to understand what makes one man good and another bad , what makes one man gentle and another hard , who with a whip on his back had tried to feel and comprehendreason , logic and truth , who had fought and killed without hating what he was fighting and killing ; this man , Gideon Jackson , would have quickly and surely killed StephanHolms and felt no regret for it . And now , Gideon repeated , " You believe that , do n't you ? " " I believe it , Gideon , " Holms said quietly . And added with complete sincerity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the few people of my class who does not draw back in horror from the color of a man 's skin . You see , I am essentially a reasonable and logical human being : so are you . We recognize that certain shibboleths have been set up . I can afford to smile at them , at the brainless , empty idiots  --  my friends , I admit  --  who look upon all creatures of your race ,  |p18o  and so many of mine , as being inferior . God knows , I recognizetheir caliber . But my lot is with them , Gideon , partially by birth , partially by choice . Let us face the facts ; my people lost a great deal by the war , not only power  --  which is no small thing in itself  --  but material things that result from power , a way of life . I wanted those things back , and I fought for them sensibly . " " And now you have them . " " To a degree , " Holms admitted . " There are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have succeeded . I need not pretend ; you know why Rutherford Hayes is our next president , and you know that he is at least gentleman enough to keep his word . At any rate , the Republican party has made its peace with us , and certain things will be done . " " You are a truthful and a reasonable man , " Gideon said , staring at Holms with real curiosity . " You pride yourself on that , do n't you ? " " After a fashion , yes . " " And you did n't come here to gloat . You are much too civilized for that . " " Much too civilized , Gideon . Too civilized to be impressed by a black man 's irony . And you , I think , are too civilized to throw me out of here . " " I want to hear what you have to say , " Gideon answered quietly . " I thought you would . Let 's dispense with innuendoes . I admire you , Gideon . I watched you during the Convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amazing development . You are a man of great ability and profound talent . You have a mind . The mere Tact that a former slave , whose speech was back-country gibberish , should be the culturedman I speak with now , is in itself incredible . I have listened to you in Congress , often with admiration . Your delivery , which has that rare combination of being both rationaland emotional , is most effective in moving men . " " You are flattering , " Gideon said . " Go on . " " I think that if you had the original of that amazing and stupid document you showed to President Grant , you might have gone to Congress with it and changed history . Or per/haps not . Our party has a majority in the House , and it is doubtful whether one man in one act can appreciably change history . " " So you know about that too . At least , you are thorough . " " We have had to be thorough , Gideon . We were the conquered . Our country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as your country ? " " Essentially , yes . The country of a few select men , men who are fit to rule . You should recognize that , Gideon . Neither the degenerate white trash that we have used in the Klan , nor the debased and childlike nigger field-hand is capable of rule . You are an exception . I am an exception . That is why I appeal to you , both with sincerity and logic . There are other ways , but how much simpler it would be if you were with us , if some of your colleagues joined us . The nigger will follow you ; he has before ; he will continue to . In the long run , our way is best . I dislike force and I dislike violence , believe me ; I will use them if necessary , but how much better it would be to achieve our ends without resorting to wholesale violence . A land where prosperity and order is combined for the good of all , where the man in the field has enough to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bread . " " And you propose this to me ? " Gideon asked incredulously . " Will you accept ? " " That I should lead my people back to slavery ? " " If you would put it that way . " " You are incredible , " Gideon said softly . " I should have recognized that the first time. , when I went to your house . But I looked upon you as human . I looked upon all men as human . I failed to realize that a disease could enter a man 's mind , a disease beyond cure . I did n't understand that some men are sick , and with their sickness they could contaminate the earth . We all make mistakes , do n't we ? I think that was the greatest mistake that the men on my side made .

But the blood of the sick , the diseased , the debased beyond reason  --  that blood never ranP182at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been led and lied to . We let your kind live  --  " Gideon had not seen Senator Holms angry before , a tightening of the lips , a few vertical lines on the high , smooth brow . Senator Holms rose , put on his coat and hat , picked up his gloves and stick from the desk . " I take it that is your answer , " he said . " You may take it as such , " Gideon agreed . Gideon and Jeff took the three o'clock train for the South the following day . There was not much that Gideon took with him , a small bag and a briefcase which contained his old copy of Whitman 's poems , a signed photograph of Charles Sumner , which had been given to him just before that man 's death , and a notebook . He intended to write a report of the whole Hayes-Tilden affair , and he thought he might start it on the train , to pass the hours away . With Jeff , he walked down the platform , the length of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Why ? " " You do n't know , do you ? " Gideon realized , looking at his son . " You remember , I told you it did not come like a bomb bursting . You see , it 's been going on . " They came to the last car , an old and venerable veteran of the road . The windows were dirty ; two of them had been replaced by boarding . Over the door , a sign said simply , " Colored . " Jeff read it and turned on his father . " No  --  no , it 's impossible ! It 's rotten , do you hear me , rotten ! You  --  a member of Congress  --  " " Get in , Jeff , " Gideon said . " This is n't a new thing . It grows in popularity . One gets accustomed . " They got in and sat together on the old wooden bench . Other colored people filed in . And in time , the train started . Gideon said : " After all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be back at Car-well . "   How Gideon Jackson and His Son CameOnce More to CarwellMARCUS WAS WAITING FOR THEM AT THE STATION , AND TOJeff , this was a stranger , actually and completely , this slim , handsome Negro boy , lighter-skinned than any other Jackson , reaching only to Gideon 's shoulder , but well-proportioned , small in the hips , broad at the shoulders , moving so easily , so gracefully that Jeff 's first thought was of a wild animal , unafraid , possessed of itself , and completely integrated . Dressed in blue jeans and a brown leather jacket , he stood casually by a one horse chaise , grinned at Gideon , waved a hand , and then engaged in a frankly curious study of his brother . " Hello , son , " Gideon said , and then began to toss the bags into the freight box . There was a way between them , a warm regard that Jeff recognized in the offhand manner they shook hands . " Picked a fine day to come back , " Marcus remarked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know me , do you ? " " You 've grown , " Jeff admitted . He put his bags in with Gideon 's . Then he shook hands with his brother ; then they stood there , facing each other , Marcus grinning a little . Gideon came around the chaise , watching the two of them , feeling the wonderful achievement of having them both with him , together like that , the massive , earnest pile of Jeff facingthe grinning , handsome boy . " I 'll drive , " Gideon said . " Get in . " " Dr. Jackson ? " Marcus smiled . Jeff said , " That 's right . My God , how old are you ? " " You 've forgotten that too  --  twenty . " " Twenty , " Jeff repeated .   " Get in , " Gideon said . Marcus told Jeff , " You first , doctor , " bowing and extending a hand . " All right , " Gideon told them . The three crowded onto the single seat , and Jeff put an arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lonely , " Jeff said . Marcus said aloofly , " You talk like a foreigner ; You back to stay now ? " " Maybe . " " You 'll find it changed , " Marcus said . " We have n't sat still . " Gideon listened to them ; it was good to be in the old chaise with his sons , to have the reins in his hand , and to be guidingthe little black mare down the road . It was a fine , clear March day , not too cool , not too warm , the sort of a day just before the spring that can be more wonderful in South Carolina than anywhere else in the world . The mare was a five-year-old that he had bought two summers before , a small , alert animal with a smooth trot . He liked to drive ; all during the long winter months in Washington , he had been thinking of this , of sitting behind the mare , listening to the steady thud of its hoofs . When they turned off the dirt road onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told Jeff proudly : " We built this four years ago . It cuts the distance to the railroad in half . " " We built other things , " Marcus remarked , unable to keep a smug note of satisfaction out of his voice . Jeff had been away ; he had done the things Marcus wanted to do . Gideon glanced sidewise at them . " Jeff 's home to stay , " he said . " Is he ? He 'll find it mighty lonely at Carwell . " Gideon told Jeff how they had built the causeway . Most of them had worked on the railroad right of way , and knew the mechanics behind the principle . They had laid out the line of the road themselves , straight as an arrow , without an engineer , a mile and a half of it . " When I mentioned it in the house , " Gideon said , " the only comment came from one of my colleagues , who wanted to know how we came by the right to build on government property . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " My daddy went a hunting , Lord , Lord , Lord , my daddy went a hunting , Lord , Lord , Lord ... "  | " You remember that ? " " I remember a good deal , " Jeff said . Jenny was grown , a woman , her full breasts high under her smock ; Jeff held her and his mother in his arms . " You 're so big , so big . " " I 'm no bigger , " Jeff smiled . Rachel wept with complete happiness ; she had grown old more markedly than Gideon ; she kept touching Jeff 's face , running her hand across his woolly hair . Gideon and Marcus stood apart from them . Marcus said to his father , " I read in the papers  --  " " Yes . " " How was it ? Does it mean  --  ? " " I 'm not sure what it means , " Gideon said . " We 'll talk about it later . " Marcus said , " They do n't know us if they think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us off with the stroke of a pen . " " We 'll talk about it later . " " They do n't know us , " Marcus said . They led Jeff around and showed him things . Suddenly , everything had become new again . They showed him the house , a simple frame structure of five rooms , painted white outside . The chimney was red brick . " Kiln brick , " Jenny said . Rachel showed the kitchen ; they had tin pans , bright and shiny , a whole set of them in graduated sizes hanging from the wall ; there was an iron spider . And more wonderfulthan anything , there was an inside pump . Rachel pumped fresh , cold well water . " Here , just you try it , Jeff . " He had to try it , drink a glass and say what fine water it was . Jeff said , " Are the other places like this , the other people ? I mean , you being a Congressman  --  " " A person 's house is like himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't had to complain . This is a good land for a man who loves it and understands it . " Jeff wanted to know what became of the old slave cabins , and Gideon said they were still there , untenanted . " No one lives there now ? " " No one , " Gideon said . " No one bought the house , no one wanted it . " There was a note in his voice that made 86 Jeff look at him curiously . Marcus said that afterwards , if the doctor had time , they could walk over to the big house . Rachel was torn between a desire to serve the hot bread and chicken she had prepared and show Jeff the rest of the house . She would say nothing about the real beds with metal springs ; he would have to see them for himself . She led him into the bedrooms . " Where does Ellen live ? " he asked . " With Brother Peter . All of Allenby 's children with Brother Peter . " " Was it bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She came here , " Marcus said . " She wanted to be here . " " But she went back ? " " Yes , she went back . " " She knew I was coming ? " " Yes , she knew . All the people know . They 'll come later . " Rachel spread her hands on the bed and pushed up and down . " Soft and sweet , like a baby in a cradle . Feel here , Jeff . " He pressed on the mattress . " Just set on it . " He sat down , smiling at her . " Go ahead , go ahead and move up and down , up and down . " He jounced up and down , then rose and put his arms around Rachel . She could n't resist the kitchen now , whirled him through the other bedroom and then into and out of the parlor , a small room packed close with overstuffed Victorian furniture , a table , and Gideon 's books . Then they sat at the kitchen table and Jeff told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't no corn bread in Scotland ? " Jeff answered , no , none , none anywhere in that whole land . To please Rachel , he ate more than he could hold , just ate and ate , and then she began to cry again , looking at him and touching his hands . " All right , mother , now everything 's all right . " But she kept on crying . Gideon and Marcus went out to the porch . " She should n't take on so , " Gideon said uneasily . The need , the aching hunger in Rachel had never been so apparent as now . " I 'll unhitch the mare , " Marcus said . " He 'll want to go to Ellen . " " Will he ? " " I guess he will . "   " Well , they 're going to come over here , all of them , they are . He can just as well wait here . I 'll unhitch the mare . " Gideon nodded . Marcus led the horse away , and Gideon stood on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhatsad , somewhat lonely . This should be a beginning ; insteadit was an end . He shook his head savagely ; only a fool would think that way . Washington was one thing , unhealthy , full of small , hungry , frustrated , ambitious men ; this was something else , this was his home . Washington was not America ; this , multiplied over a million times , was  --  this small frame house , the homely furniture that filled it , the live oaks and the locusts that covered it over and shaded it from the sun , the sweeping hillsides , the fields where cotton and corn and tobacco would grow soon , the plough that Marcushad left out there , a few hundred yards from the house , tilted , the stiff , wet March soil clinging to its blade  --  all this was his , his own . This he had fought for , slaved for , worked for , planned for ; a man is not parted from the ground that has tasted his blood , his free footsteps . A man has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Marcus went into the house and told Jeff , " She 's coming now , " nodding over his shoulder . Jeff went outside alone . Brother Peter came walking through the slanting shadows toward the house , holding Ellen 's arm . Brother Peter had grown a beard since Jeff last saw him ; close to sixty years , his thin , tall figure had a patriarchal dignity . The beard was white , and he walked with a limp . Gideon said that he had been ailing . When an old field slave passed forty-five , he was hardly ever much good for anything ; rheumatism crept into all his bones ; malarial fever wracked him , and an enlarged heart recorded the endless hours of toil behind him . But the girl by his side was as she had always been , as Jeff remembered her , more mature , rounder , more full in body , but much as Jeff remembered her , the head held high , the glossy black hair braided behind her shoulders . Jeff walked toward them , and Brother Peter and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and say some- 88 thing . Then the girl stood without moving . Brother Peter smiled at Jeff and said : " Welcome home , my son . " Jeff halted a few paces from them . Ellen 's face was turned toward him . Then he went over to her and took her hand and said , " Hello , Ellen . Do you remember ? " She nodded , just slightly . " I 'll go up to the house and pay my respects to Brother Gideon , " Brother Peter said . " And you two just come along when it pleases you . " Jeff nodded . The old man walked away . Jeff remained there , holding her hand , and she did n't move , standing straight and still . She wore a green calico frock , a blue cape thrown over her shoulders , black stockings and black shoes . And finally she said , " Jeff , do I look the same  --  do I look the way you wanted me to look ? " " Just that way . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a difference . But you look the way I wanted you to look . " " I 'm older , Jeff . " " We 're both of us older . " He took her arm and they began to walk . Jeff led her along the slope , toward the field Marcus had been ploughing . As it was in the old times , he told her how the sun was setting . He was full of Carwell , choking with it , feeling all the sensuous rush of discovery that comes with a return to youth . The smokey , mist-filled , fog-corroded Scottish skies were alreadypart of an only dimly-recalled past ; here the sky was a glaze of March blue , streaked with the sunset colors of gold and orange and pink . Here the land was warm and lush and soft ; he and his kind were not made for rocky , treeless hillsides . He had finally come home , and as with Gideon , that in itself was sustenance and comfort . He told Ellen how the sky was , but not how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crushed the strong-smelling dirt in his hands , and then pressed it against hers . " How far is Scotland ? " she wanted to know , and he told her that it was at least four thousand miles from here . But that was distanceP189beyond her conception , just distance and distance , gathering on without end . " It 's good you 're back . But you 're different now , Jeff . You 're a man . You 're a doctor . My father was a doctor . Did you know , Jeff ? " " Of course I knew . " They climbed the hillside toward the house , stopping to rest where Marcus had built a bench . The house stood like a small , squat box in the gathering dusk above them . People were coming ; the sound of voices drifted down . There was a steady thud-thud of horses ' hoofs on the other cheek of the hill , on the little road that led to the house . Someone up there called : " Jeff  --  oh , where are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " We 'll go up in a little while . " They sat there , and it grew dark . A dog barked and barked . Jeff said finally , " Have you thought that you would marry me when I came back ? " " Do you want to marry me ? " 1 --  " I want to , " Jeff said . " A blind woman . " " Some day , " Jeff said , " I 'll learn how to give you backyour eyes . " " They 're calling us , " she told him . He took her hand and led her up to the house . Everyone at Carwell had come . Horses and mules were hobbled all the length of the barnyard . The women had brought their children , new children whom Jeff had never seen before . The house was full ; the porch was full . People r , crowded around him , the older people , flinging more questionsat him than he could answer . The young men , who were children when he had gone away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The women cried with Rachel . It surprised Jeff to see how many white folks there were , the casual , easy , * - way they mingled with the Negroes . Some of them he knew , the lanky , red-headed Abner Lait , squat , small-eyed Frank Carson ; others , he did n't know . There were young men hi age , tow-headed sunburnt boys who watched him curious y but without malice . The new schoolmaster was there , a Rhode Island Yankee led Benjamin Winthrope . He said , " The benefit to the community of having you here , Dr. Jackson , is inestimable . I presume you 'll stay . " " I hope to , " Jeff nodded . There was a white man , a worn , small man , Fred McHugh by name , who said to Jeff , " The way my woman 's  --  you could n't come along and see her ? " " I could , tomorrow , " Jeff agreed . McHugh said , " There 's a pain in her belly like a snake eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Marcus had an accordion sat on the edge of the porch , playing , " My mammy chased me home to Atlanta , to Atlanta , to Atlanta . " The young people around him kept time , beatingtheir feet on the ground , clapping their hands . Gideon opened three jugs of corn , and everybody had to drink . Rachel and the women stood over the stove with frying pans and pots . The strong sound of voices singing ran over the dark fields , " My mammy chased me home to Atlanta  --  " Brother Peter said to Gideon , " We have our rewards , we taste of happiness . " And some of the people standing by nodded , " Amen . " X Jeff said to Marcus the next day , " Come along . " " Some men can play , others got to work . " " There 's time for work . " " Go with him , " Gideon said . " I 'll pick up your plough . " He was back in his old and shapeless shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " Gideon said . Marcus harnessed the mare , and they drove the chaise to the schoolhouse . It was a single-room , white-painted frame building with a short steeple on the farther end , and that way served the dual purpose of meeting house and school . Some thirty boys and girls of varying ages sat in the pews ; Winthrope 's was the complex problem of teaching all subjects for all ages and preserving order at the same time . A harried man , he was flustered and flattered that Jeff had come so soon . The visit broke down discipline , and he alternated between imposing order on the class and explaining his methods to Jeff . One age group would study while he gave oral instruction to another .   " It 's difficult , " he admitted . " Two teachers and two rooms would be so much better . I 've found , however , that certain things break down . If I speak on literature for the oldest , it does not harm the youngest to listen . " " Naturally not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am comparatively new here . Old Mr. Allenby , who preceded me , had his own methods . They were not the most modern , you understand . " " Still , when I remember that even a schoolhouse was once a dream . . . They drove on . Jeff said , " I want to stop at McHugh 's house . You know where that is ? " " I know . Because his wife 's sick ? " " He wants me to look at her . " " So we have a doctor now . " " Worse things could happen , " Jeff said . " Maybe so . " Jeff looked at him , but Marcus said nothing more . McHugh'splace was in sight of the old plantation house , a small building , but set off with care . He had planted shrubs around it , an unusual thing in that section . He lived with his wife , a good deal alone , mixing hardly with anyone ; he had no children . When Jeff came in and saw the neglect , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Ailing on and off a year now . She stays to bed now . Last night she did n't scream none , just moaning and whimpering . He led Jeff into the bedroom , where a colorless , thin woman of forty lay . " This is Gideon 's boy , Jeff . He 's a doctor man from studying in the old country . He 's a fine boy , Sally . He going to look at you , please , Sally . " She said nothing , just lay there , staring at the ceiling . " Would you go out ? " Jeff asked McHugh . After he left , the woman did n't move . Jeff said , " Please , ma'am , I 'm a doctor . Maybe I can help you . " " If you can , you can . " Jeff touched her abdomen , and she twisted and groaned with pain . When he came out , McHugh was waiting for him . " Did you have Dr. Leed up from town ? " " I had him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He say she 's going to die , " McHugh muttered . " Did he know what it was ? " " Ca n't ask Doc Leed no questions , " McHugh said . " He do n't take to Carwell folks . He say she going to die , that 's all . " Marcus , standing there , asked , " Do you know what it is , Jeff ? " " I think I know . I think it 's what they call typhlitis  --  that 's an inflammation of a part of the intestines , a small , fingerlikeprojection . Often , for some reason we do n't understand , an inflammation sets in , and if uncontrolled , becomes gangrenous . At a certain stage , it responds to ice treatments . At this stage , it does n't . " " You mean she 's going to die ? " McHugh asked . Jeff nodded . " You ca n't do nothing ? Jesus Christ , you ca n't do noth-ing ? " Jeff said , " I remember , when I was with Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The patient recovered . That surgeon operated . I never saw another operation of the sort . In Edinburgh , they admitted it fatal . " " Could you operate ? " Marcus asked . " I do n't know  --  " " Well , God damn it , you can try , ca n't you ? If she 's going to die anyway ! " " I do n't know how , " Jeff said . " You ca n't try something when you do n't know how . " " Why not ? " Jeff stared at Marcus . McHugh was watching them both , his upper lip trembling . He said , " Look a here , Jeff . I know Gideon  --  way back , I know Gideon . Time was , they said to me , God damn you , McHugh , stay away from that nigger . You know how it was , send me a note with blood on it , stay away from that nigger . Then Gideon come to me and talk about buying the land ; I go along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go off to Aiken to be a vote watcher , after they tar and feather a white man for voting niggers.  |p193You  ask Gideon ? Just ask him if I held back . Just ask him how I told that son of a bitch Jason Hugar  --  " " All right , " Jeff nodded . If I leave her alone , she has n't more than a few days to live , and she 'd be in pain all the time , terrible pain . Marcus , drive back to the house . Bring my small bag ; bring some clean sheets and towels . Tell mother to come back with you . Have you any corn whisky ? " he asked McHugh . The man nodded . " All right , go in and ease her and begin to feed her whisky , just a little at a time ; try not to make her sick ; do n't give her enough to make her drunk , no more than half a cupful all told . Wait a minute , put a fire in your stove first and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among the women ? " Pale , frightened , McHugh said , " Helen Lait . " " Fetch her , Marcus . Can she stand up ? Do you understand what I 'm going to do , McHugh ? I 'm going to cut open your wife 's stomach and cut out that diseased portion . It 's going to hurt her . It 's going to be a bad thing to watch . And I have to do it right away . " McHugh nodded . " I want your permission . I want you to say that you 're willing . " " I 'm willing , " McHugh whispered . " Understand  --  this is something I never did before . I do n't even know how to do it . If I make a mistake , your wife is going to die . Even if I do it right , the gangrene may set in and she may die . That 's a risk you take in any operation , and here , with these primitive facilities , it 's worse . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porch , waiting , when Jeff came back to the house . It was almost sunrise . Jeff said tiredly , " Did n't you sleep ? " " No  --  I had a lot to think about . Is she still alive ? " Jeff nodded . " She sleeping now , quietly . She 's all right , I think  --  no , I know it . She 's all right . " " Try to get some sleep yourself . " Jeff smiled and shook his head . He sat down on the edge of the porch , next to Gideon . The world grew lighter . Pres- ently , the first edge of the sun showed . A cock crowed somewhere . Softly , Jeff said , " My God , when I think about it  --  when I think that only two men in the whole world have done it before . When I think of how simple it is , once you know . When I think that I did it here , with nothing , do you understand , with nothing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you know how many people die every year of typhlitis ? Thousands , perhaps . A country doctor calls it acute indigestion , or poisoning , or a tumor . But it 's typhlitis  --  " Gideon nodded , put a hand on Jeff 's shoulder . " You did n't want me to come here . " " I did n't want you to come , " Gideon admitted . " I had reason , Jeff . " " There are no reasons , " Jeff said . " Do you know that when I was just a boy , I used to envy you . You were possessed ; you were building a new world . Well , I do n't envy you now ; I think I know you . I 'm going to go on building , here  --  I 'm going to build  --  " " Try . to get some sleep . " " I ca n't sleep now , " Jeff smiled . " My God , how can I sleep now ? " A week later , Jeff and Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brother Peter , in his new black deacon coat , said , " Do you , Jeff Jackson , take this woman  --  ? " Gideon watched , thinking how strangely , how surely and slowly time moved . He felt old ; in a sense , he felt used up . He stood with his arm around Rachel , and he listened to Brother Peter 's voice , that voice which had been with him all his life , that sure , confident , resonant voice .. . Jeff had picked for his home a small plot of land near the schoolhouse , a piece that was owned by the people in community . They had set this section aside for a school and a cemetery , and as Jeff said lightly , it might well do for him to be near both . Gideon arranged for the building ; they were old hands at it by now . The timber was their own , two by fours , sweet-smelling pine siding , three-quarter inch plank for the flooring , dovetail oak to do the inside properly . Allp195of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hannibal Washington , a fine bricklayer , set in the hearths and chimneys . Jeff spent hours drawing plans : a sunlit examination room , a space for two beds , a large section that would someday be an operating room . He said to Gideon , finally , " It comes out the largest house at Carwell . " " Which is fitting , " Gideon agreed . " Where will the money come from ? " " I have enough money for that , I think , " Gideon smiled . " I ca n't take any more from you . I 've been taking all these years . " " I would n't worry about it , Jeff . You 'll want equipment , wo n't you , furniture , beds ? Other things ? " " They cost a lot . " " We 'll manage . I suppose you could find some of it in Columbia , but I think we 'd do better in Charleston . We 'll go there soon . " He had other reasons for wanting to go to Charleston , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , he and Jeff , could go together . For the time being , Jeff and Ellen lived with Gideon . There was a deep trust and close communion between Ellen and Rachel , something Gideon did not share . Once Jeff said to his father , " Do you hold it against me , my marrying Ellen ? " " A man should marry the woman he loves , " Gideon replied . And he tried to tell that to himself , to make himself believe that along with many other things . As he realized later , much of the world he lived in that March of 1869 was a fool 's world ; for Gideon Jackson to believe that the sun stood still and that time stood still was strange : stranger even than that was the fact that he had so much real happiness in those few weeks , happiness married by many small things  --  but real happiness . For the first time in almost a decade , Gideon laid aside his books ; he did n't want to read , to study , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increasingnumber of patients , he spent the whole of every day working with Marcus . For people so far apart , so different in basic matters , he and Marcus understood each other well . Marcus lacked the driving pain that was a part of Gideon and Jeff ; for them there was the whole of the puzzling world , for Marcus the world was constrained and understandable , and in a sense more complete . Marcus was a sinner ; Brother Peter admitted that sadly yet comprehendingly ; Marcus loved the fact of women , body , breast and thigh , without shame yet without lust  --  and animal health and freedom filled him like a cup brimming over with life liquid . Small and slim as he was , he could outwork Gideon ; he drank with the white men , the way they drank , matching Leslie Carson 's son , Joe , drink for drink , down a half-gallon jug of raw corn . He loved to dance . His accordion made the old music new ; all the old swamp songs , the tired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers they became something new . He gave them new rhythms , new lifeHe worshipped Gideon . He knew cotton , but Gideon knew it better ; he knew the soil and bowed to Gideon there . They worked at the forge in the barn and put a new tire on a cartwheel . Stripped to the waist , Gideon drove his hammer like a smith . Forty-five years had n't taken the strength out of his arms , and as the hammer came down again and again , it filled the world with its sound . " Mark it , " the boy sang , turning the iron , " mark it , mark it , mark it ! " And Gideon piled on , sweat streaming down his face . They shifted all the remaining fodder into a new bin , working together in smooth rhythm with their forks , singing together , " I got a crick in my back , I 'm old and tired . " They cleared swamp growth for planting , swinging two-edged axes in short , stinging blows , and came tramping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but delighted with themselves . Jeff told Gideon , " At your age , that is n't the wisest thing  --  " " At my age , " Gideon smiled . " It 's not as if you did it all the time . When you live a sedentary life most of the year  --  " Gideon and Marcus took a day off hunting , Gideon with a rifle in hope of raising a deer , Marcus with a shotgun , sayinghe would be satisfied with rabbits . They whistled their two speckled pointers , filled their pockets with bread , andp197set off across the fields one cold , crisp morning . They sang their own song , softly and happily , " Daddy went a hunting , Lord , Lord , Lord , yes , Daddy went a hunting , Lord , Lord , Lord . . . " The dogs fanned out and cut back and forth across the meadows . The two men did n't talk much ; somehow , it never mattered that Gideon and Marcus had so little to say to each other ; they fitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not hide nor hair of a deer had Gideon seen , but Marcus 's pouch held a brace of fat rabbits . He took them to the barn to skin and dress them and give the dogs their reward of the gizzards ; Gideon went to the house . Jeff was waiting for him , his face like a piece of granite , his eyes hard , the way Gideon had never seen them before . He led his father into the parlor ; Abner Lait sat there , his big red hands tight on his knees . " What is it ? " Gideon wanted to know . Abner Lait looked at him strangely , and Gideon said , " For God 's sake ; what happened ? " Jeff motioned him into the bedroom ; Rachel sat there , her face blank of expression . A man on the bed moaned a little , twisted a little ; his whole body was wrapped in bandages . " McHugh , " Gideon whispered . Jeff said , " That 's right . " Gideon went to the bed and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay there as before , twisting a little , moaning a little . Gideon took his hand , " Fred  --  it 's Gideon. " - Back in the parlor , they were joined by Marcus . " He waste ' 1 whipped ? " Gideon asked . " You could say it that way , whipped . " " His wife ? " " She 's dead , " Abner Lait said quietly . " Those sons ofd bitches murdered her . Those filthy bastards took her out of her bed and killed her . " Jeff told him as much as they could get from the tortured , half insane McHugh . Six men in the white robes of the Klan had come to his house last night . They dragged him and his wife from bed , in spite of his pleading that his wife was sick , that it would kill her . They dragged them into the barn , tied their crossed wrists to a rafter , and whipped them.  | " I do n't think his wife suffered much , " Jeff said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she died . But Fred had to hang there and watch her , until almost three o'clock when we found them . " " Will he live ? " Gideon said . Smiling strangely , Jeff answered , " That 's an academicquestion . He 's out of his mind and his arms are no good . He 'll never be able to work again . " Abner Lait said , " You know what I want to do , Gideon. like to know what you 're going to do ? " l-'It 's time you told them , is n't it ? " Jeff said . " I did n't see any use in telling them . " " It 's time you told them , I think , " Jeff said . " All right , tomorrow , " Gideon nodded . " We 'll have a meeting tomorrow . " Jeff was waiting for Marcus on the porch . He caught him by the arm and stopped him . " Marcus ? " " Yes ? " " What are you holding against me ? " Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding a thing against you . " " Do we go on like this ? " " We 're going on all right , " Marcus said . " What have I done ? " Jeff said . " It 's nothing you done . " " Is it because I 've been away and you stayed here ? Is that it ? " " No --   --  " What then ? " " Nothing , " Marcus said . " How many times I got to tell you that ? Nothing . " " All right  --  do n't be angry . " " I ai n't angry . " " You remember , when we were children , it was different . " " Everything 's different for children . " " You think I 'm against  --  Gideon ? " Marcus kept silent . " You think that , do n't you ? "  |p199The  men filled the schoolhouse , black men and white men in their work clothes blue jeans and blue overalls , heavy leather shoes , brown antic red shirts . With the white men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin was wind- blown and sun-tannedhe black men ranged in color from plum to ivory . Counting Winthrope , the school teacher , counting the eighteen- and nineteen-year-olds , there were more than fifty men in the room . One was a doctor , one was a preacher , one was a schoolteacher , one was a congressman ; the main trade of the rest was farming . Principally , they grew cotton , but they grew tobacco too , some rice , corn ; they held cattle and hogs and horses . They made up a community called Carwell , and what they made had not existed a decade before , nor did it hive its exact counterpart anywhere outside of the south . War , ruin , death , emancipation , and peonage had thrown them together ; they had built from nothing in the strictest sense of the word , and they could look about them and say that this or that or everything had come from their hands . They had created everything among them , schools , houses , mills , ideas , because there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy , they had crossed over in one long step . As Gideon Jackson stood before them now , looking at them , weighing them , remembering faces , remembering the different lives each man there had lived , he thought of that . Jeff wanted to build  --  and Gideon had a sudden despairing vision of how men could build . He said to the people : " All of you know me . I have talked to you before . " They knew him ; they had voted for him ; they had drivenStill , Marcus kept silent . " Do you know what 's coming ? Did he tell you what 's coming ? What he thinks is coming ? " " I did n't ask him , he did n't tell me , " Marcus said . " He thinks it 's the end of all this did you know that ? " Marcus nodded . " What are you going to do ? " " He knows what to do , " Marcus replied .   their wagons twenty miles in every direction , telling people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know what happened to Fred McHugh . We buriedhis wife this morning . In our little graveyard , outside of here , four people lie who have died through violence , who havebeen murdered at Carwell in the past eight years . That is aterrible thing . To take a human life in any cause is a terriblething . But men become beasts when they murder to imposeterror on free men . You know why Fred McHugh waswhipped , why his wife was tortured to death  --  only for onereason , to tell the white men here at Carwell that they canno longer live together or work together with black men . " Why is that so important ? Why is it so necessary here that the white man should learn to hate the Negro , to despisehim , to humiliate him , and that the Negro in turn should learn to fear . the white man , avoid him , mistrust him ? Is it because the two , the black and the white , are incompatible , that they can not work or live together ? But Carwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differently . Is it because the blood will mix , the white being debauched by the black , as the Klan has screamed all through the South ? But we have lived here for almost a decade , and that has not happened . Our children have set in this schoolhouse together , and thathas not happened . Then what is the reason ? What is this great sin that we have committed here at Carwell , that black men and white men have committed everywhere in theSouth when they put their good right arms together ? It is important for us to know , not only for the black peoplehere , but for the white people . " I do n't want to frighten you , my friends . God knows , I had reason enough to be frightened in Washington , but when I came back to Carwell , all seemed different . It reassured me ; this is my home ; these people are my friends . They knew me when I was a slave , when I ran away from Dudley Carwell , my master , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , to a great domain which had lost its master , its overseers , its whips and its compulsions . I looked around me , and here was reason , here were the good things of life ; so I said top201myself , all the evil things I dreamed of can not be , not here , not where we have built . I lived for a little while in my fool 's paradise . " That is gone , my friends . I want to tell you the truth now , I want you to understand why Fred McHugh lies in my house , his arms twisted from their sockets and useless to him , his wife dead , his mind gone . I want to tell you why , when my son and I came down here from Washington , we were forced to ride in a separate car marked , Colored . ' I want to tell you why , all over the South , from Texas to Virginia , cries of suffering fill the air . And most of all , I want you to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be set against the black like a dog against a sheep ; why , if they succeed , it will be a dream that there had ever been uch a place as Carwell . " How is it that no one here at Carwell belongs to the Klan ? How is it that all over the South honest , hardworking farmerstill their land and do not belong to the Klan . Who belongs to the Klan , if it is , as our newspapers tell us , the honestprotest of an indignant and suffering and prostrate South ? Where does it come from ? Who organized it ? If it wishes to save the South from the savage nigger , why does it strike down two white men for every black man , why did it comehere to Carwell and kill Fred McHugh 's sick wife ? " It took me a long time to realize what the Klan is , how it operates , why it was organized . I know now , just as you know . The Klan has only one purpose , to destroy democracy in the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in so doing , the black man from the white man . The black man will becomea peon , not too different from the slave he was before the war . And because he is that , a slave in effect if not in fact , the white man will be drawn down with him . A few will become great and mighty , as before the war . But only a few . For the rest of us , poverty , hunger , hatred  --  such hatred as will become a sickness for this nation . L ' " " That is the sin Fred McHugh committed at Carwell . He Cwastortured so that Abner Lait , Jake Sutter , Frank Carson , m - Leslie Carson , Will Boone  --  every white man here would take heed and play his correct part in the day of reckoning  | That is up to you ; there is a way out that is no way out . Join the Klan , cooperate with the Klan , do n't resist  --  and destroy yourselves . You know those men , the dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overseers , thewhip men , the hangers on , the toughs , the gamblers , thecheats , the sheriffs , the men who became brave with a gun in their hands but not brave enough to be seen at the front , not brave enough to die , the way thousands of southern men died because they loved their land . I do n't have to describe them ; when they dragged Sally McHugh out of her bed , hanged her up by her hands , and whipped her to death , they described themselves . ' They are the scum , the dregs of this land . For every one of them , there are a hundred decent , good men in this South ; but the scum are organized ; the decent , good men are not . They have money ; they have hirelings to plead their cause at Washington ; they have rich planters to lead them and direct them . We have none of those things  --  and I , for one , say thank God . " What are we to do ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take his gun and kill Jason Hugar . That 's not the way . To lose our heads , to murder the way they murder  --  that'snot the way . " " Then what is the way , Gideon ? " Abner Lait shouted . " Why do n't you tell us what happened at Washington ? " " I 'll tell you . At Washington , we were sold . We were sold by the Republican Party , my party , Abe Lincoln 's party  --  and the price was the presidency . The planters paid that price . In return , when Hayes takes office , the troops will be withdrawn , from Columbia , from Charleston  --  from everywhere . The Klan will become the law  --  " " Then you admit it ! " " I admit it . I told you I would give you the truth . But what are we going to do ? Lose our heads ? Murder ? Rip ourselves to pieces ? Do their work for them before they 're ready to do it themselves ? Is that what you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is that what you want ? " he repeated . " If that 's what you want , I 'm no use here  --  I 'll go . " There was a long moment of silence , and then Frank Car-1 son said , " Go on , Gideon , tell us what you think . "   " All right . Remember that we 're still strong . Here in this room are fifty of us ; we have arms ; we have ammunition ; we have drilled together and worked together . I think we can defendourselves if we do n't lose our heads . On the other hand , defense will not help us ; to lose gloriously will not help us . We have to organize with others ; all over the South are thousandslike us . I 've arranged to go to Charleston and meet with Francis Cardozo and other Negro leaders . Anderson Clay and Arnold Murphy , white leaders , will be there . Perhaps together , we can find some way of forstalling them . I 'm not promising you anything ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me try . After that , there will be time for other things . Let me try ; let Jason Hugar live ; it wo n't change things to kill him . If you 'll give me a chance  --  " The men sat there , and then a few heads nodded . " All right , " Abner Lait said softly . " Try . " Ellen could n't sleep ; all night long she heard , through the wall , the soft , animal-like moans of Fred McHugh . It was the body and the sound and the memory of terror ; she remembered the things she did n't want to remember ; she rememberedhiding in the woods ; she remembered death and screaming . She lay there shivering and listening until , unable to stand it any more , she woke Jeff . He said , " What is it , what is it , darling ? " " I 'm afraid . " " There 's nothing to be afraid of . " " I 'm afraid  --  " His body shaped itself under her hands , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest , the slabs of loose , relaxed muscle that lay all over him , his neck , his chin , eyes , mouth . In the night , in the darkness , he and she were the same ; she clung to him , whispering , " Jeff , Jeff , Jeff . " " You see I 'm here , Ellen . I 'll always be here . " But she could n't stop being afraid ; she lay there , listening to the moans of the hurt man , short , sharp moans that came through his sleep . Suddenly , the full deeps of darkness encompassedher ; a well of darkness that people moved into and went out of , all those shadowy figures , Allenby and the ,   others , coming and going . She clung to Jeff with all her strength , but it was no use . Cardozo said to Gideon , " I 'm not denying the essential truth of your conclusions ; I deny the dramatic form in which you present them . " " I 'm not concerned with abstracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form I have to live . " Anderson Clay said , " There , I go along with Gideon . " Eight of them , five colored men and three white , sat together in Cardozo 's parlor . Four of them were from South Carolina , one from Georgia , two from Louisiana , and one from Florida . They had been talking for almost three hours now , and had come to no conclusion . Some of them were militant , others were frightened ; at least half of them seized upon the momentary opportunity of taking refuge in words . They talked in circles ; they recounted their achievements , what they had won , gained , done  --  until Gideon snapped at them : " That 's over now , I tell you . That 's in the past , finished . It has no meaning for today . " " But the record , dozens of Negroes and poor whites in the House , in the Senate , in the state governments , governorstoo  --  " " I tell you it 's done , " Gideon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked calmly , his judicial , quiet voice making reason where there was no reason . " Nobody , Gideon  --  and you know this  --  respects you more highly than I do . But are n't your conclusions empirical , to give them the most credit ? " " Because a man has been lynched here , tortured there , threatened , because Senator Holms confided in me , I must not anticipate results ? Is that what you infer ? Am I an alarm-ist ? " " To a degree , yes . " " Yet you , Francis , were state treasurer a year ago , and today you are not . What were the forces that operated ? If I say that I will not be permitted to sit in the House again , must that be tested ? Can I see no farther than my nose ? IfP205that were so , Francis , I would be a slave today , and four other black men would be slaves . " Capra , a small , aging colored man , one time representative from Florida , interposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrity . " " I do n't give two damns about my personal integrity ! " " But Gideon , you tell us that the Republican Party sold the reconstruction for the election We are the party ; our lives have been dedicated to the party ; the party fought for us , gave us our freedom . " You have no proof . You say that the troops will be withdrawn from the South ill , ten days  --  but you have no proof. - You say that there will be terror , that all we have built will be destroyed . Where is your proof ? " " It is being destroyed , " Gideon said tiredly . " Look around you . No niggers on this train , no niggers on the bench , white only , white only  --  no niggers in this school ; we built the school , but no niggers now , no niggers on this jury , the lawyerfor the defense objects . Last year the Judge was a black man , a poor white  --  today a planter or a planter 's lacky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but no niggerson the jury . " " I concede that , " Cardozo nodded . " Essentially , we have been forced to compromise  --  " " Is that compromise ? " Anderson Clay smiled . " Do you compromise with the air you breath ? Francis ? With the food you eat ? These things are the blood and bone and muscle of our lives ! You ca n't compromise with a son of a bitch who wants your blood ! " X " " You talk as a white man . Ask a black man  --  " " God damn it , I 'm sick of hearing that ! Whatever we have we 've gotten because black men and white men stood together . Gideon 's right , think the way you do and we go down separately we go down to hell . " Ables , , who three years ago was a secretary of state , asked Gideon " But why , precisely , should the Party have sold us , as you put it ? For what end ? " " Because we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs . In the last eight years , this has become an industrial nation , the greatest industrial machine on earth . The north has the west and the southwest ; even here in the South mills are beginning to open . Let the planters have their serfs back  --  the North is safe . " " And the people 's party  --  " " There is no people 's party today , " Clay growled . Cardozo answered wearily , " Still , what you ask can not be done , Gideon . To reinaugurate the Negro and poor white militia after it has been abolished  --  how ? In defiance of the law ? " " The people are the law . " " That , Gideon , is a more primitive conception than I would expect from you . The people are the law only through due process . " " A process that wrote into the Constitution the right of the people to bear arms , to have a militia ! " " We could carry the matter to the Supreme Court , that , would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pro-reconstruction force in the South  --  that , indeed , Gideon , ould produce violence . " " I see . If we raise a voice in our defense , we promote vio-lence . " " Yes . " Gideon said , " And if there should be violence regardless ? As , indeed , there has been . " Abels shook his head . " What 's the use , Jackson ? We have been over this and over this , again and again . " " Do you all feel that way ? " Gideon asked . He was used up now ; you got to the end of a thing , and that was the end . " Is that the end , gentlemen ? Well  --  it is one thing to have every newspaper in the country scream its lies , the golden cuspidors we spit into , the millions that go to walling our legislative hall with mirrors and gilt , the thousands in graft we have squeezed from a defenseless land , the way we have debauched southern manhood and womanhood , the carpetbaggers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  all that I read in my newspaper . That is one thing , gentlemen . It is another thing to sit here and have you tell me that we must not raise our voices in defense , that we must notp207try to bring unity to this twice , damned southland of ours . I love my country , gentlemen ; I did n't want to talk like this  --  but I have to . I love this country because it is my own , because it has been good to me , because it gave me dignity , courage , hope . Arq I alone in that , gentlemen ? " They sat silent , some of them stared at the floor ; some of them watched Gideon uncertainly . Anderson Clay smiled a little . " Then you all agree with Mr. Abels ? " Still silence . " And the curious part is , " Gideon said quietly , " that even those things which you cling to will be forgotten . The black men who sat in the House , in the Senate ; they will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  all of it , my friends . We will not be men any more . They will grind us down until we lose our humanity , until we hate the white men as truly as they hate us ' They will make of us a tortured , debased people , unlike any other people on earth . And how long , my friends , before we see a little sunlight again ? X How long ? Ask yourselves that . " Gideon asked Anderson Clay to come with him and meet Jeff . They walked together through the sunlit , still , whitewalledstreets of Charleston . It was such a spring day as Gideon remembered from long ago , here in this same city . The palmettos wore the clean green of the new season high on their spreading tops . The birds sang and flashed their bright plumage . The sky was a gentle blue , traced through with streaks of mist . The things that Gideon had seen on and off for so many years were familiar , and the familiarity gave the lie to his gloom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently civilized that it made its reassurance without protest or pressure , but simply and matter of factly . Anderson Clay said , " I thought I 'd like to live here some day . " " It 's a nice place to live . ' Clay said , after a while , " You know , in a way , Gideon , you were wrong and they were right . They 'll live on , but you  --  " " They 'll live on and they 'll change slowly , " Gideon an- swered thoughtfully . " Each year a little more pressure , a little more of this and that taken away . They wo n't know . Is that best ? " " I do n't say if it 's best . " " But you thought it was hopeless , from the beginning ? " " You see , Gideon , we did n't know . We started from nothing , groping around in the dark . We had only one idea , to build  --  schools , courts , hospitals , roads , people too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , mine , went a little insane when they saw there was freedom stretching ahead , maybe forever . All they thought was to build . The others wanted to destroy , and they organized for that . Ten days is n't long enough for us to organize , Gideon  --  a year is n't long enough . " " Then what ? " " Well , we 'll fight " Clay shrugged . " We 'll fight because we 've fought before , because we 're trained to fight . But they 've taken that into consideration . We 'll be fighting alone . " Jeff was waiting for them by the Battery . Gideon said , " My son , Dr. Jackson . Jeff , this is Anderson Clay , a good old friend of mine . " Jeff shook hands with the tall white man . " I hear you 've come to Charleston , doctor , to buy sup-plies . " " We 're building a hospital at Carwell , a small one . " Clay said , " I intend to come to Carwell next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , " Gideon smiled . " Eachyear , it 's next year . " " That 's right . Next year , Gideon . " They crossed to the water-front and walked along slowly . Clay and Jeff talked about Scotland , about medicine , about the lack of any sort of adequate hospital facilities in the state . " Give us time , son , " Clay said . " Some of those great old plantation houses , like the Carwellplace , " Jeff said . " They just stand , empty , useless  --  that 's what a hospital should be , in the country , big , clean . " Gideon looked at Anderson Clay . " A statesman could do worse things , " Jeff said .   " He could , " Clay nodded . " I hear you were just married . Congratulations . " " Thank you , " Jeff said . And after a moment , " It 's strange , I do n't know what came of your meeting  --  I do n't know that I care a great deal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sells his soul to live in the White House ca n't change that . " They walked slowly . The setting sun gave the water of the bay a turning sheen of color . The gulls dropped down to the water and rose triumphantly . A small sign on the rail , unobtrusive , said , " White only . " A steamer , trailing its smoke , was being piloted into the harbor . A laughing group of boys lay on the deck of a sailing gig on close tack . A carriage clattered down the street , and two children , in a grassy , iron-railed enclosure across the street , skipped rope . At Carwell , for the first time in so many years , suddenly and desolately for Gideon , things stood still . Brother Peter , coming over to his house the day after Gideon returned , saw him sitting on the edge of the porch , elbows on knees , chin in hands . " Like that for hours , " Marcus said , " low  --  " Gideon answered , " Evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gideon ? " " Uh-huh . " Brother Peter sat down beside him , first spreading the skirts of his black deacon coat . He leaned his cane , which he had been using of late , on the porch next to him , and he sat down his high black hat alongside of it . Then , sighing , he stretched his legs and remarked , " A long walk . Ai n't as spry as I used to be . " " No . " " Not near as spry , Gideon . " Gideon did n't answer . Rachel came out on the porch , and Brother Peter started to rise . " No , you just sit there . Mighty glad to see you . " " Thank you , sister . " " Stay for supper ? " " Now , I do n't mind if I do , thanking you kindly , " Brother Peter said . Rachel glanced at Gideon , who had not turned around , and Brother Peter shook his head . Rachel stood aP210moment and then went back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porch again . " Fine woman , SisterRachel . A pleasure to eat her food , a pleasure to sit at her table . There 's something I sure miss , you up there in Washington , Gideon . " " Yes . " Brother Peter went on , after a moment , " Do you good to talk , Gideon  --  do any man good to talk . Let the bile out from inside him , believe me . Was it that bad in Charleston , that awful bad ? " " Just about . " " How come then , Gideon ? How awful bad is something ? The good Lord gives and the Good Lord takes away , measurefor measure . You got no faith , Gideon . " Smiling a little , Gideon said , " I wish it were faith . " " How come then ? Man comes in this world just a naked little babe , goes out naked . There 's the judgment and the proof , Gideon . I ai n't talking about God  --  long time ago I give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store of strength , Gideon , but maybe it would have been more , you just had faith . All right , then I talk to you about men . Just leave God aside , Gideon , He do n't mind that , just leave him aside and talk about men . You believe in men , Gideon ? " " Believe in men ? " " That 's right , Gideon . " Gideon looked at the old man thoughtfully . Brother Peter brushed a speck of dust off his tall black hat . It was a gift from his congregation ; four years , day in and day out now he had worn in , excepting rain , and it looked as good and new as ever . " I think I believe in men , " Gideon said . " I do n't know  --  " " How come you do n't know that ? Maybe man got a load of sin on his shoulder , but how come nigger 's a slave one day , free man the next ? " " And a slave again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we all die off , Gideon , everyone hereabouts . You do n't think there 's a little speck of somethingleft on , little speck more than there was before . Youp211think there ai n't no hallelujah songs going to go on ring-ing ? " Gideon said nothing ; the evening wore on , the sun sank . Marcus came up , glanced at them , and entered the house . Finally , Gideon said , " Supper soon , Brother Peter . " " Sure enough . Tell you , I got a good appetite too for an old gentleman my age . Walking does that . You just go in and I 'll join you , brother . " Gideon rose and went into the house . Jeff had just finished washing his hands at the kitchen pump . Rachel said , " Going to have Brother Peter for supper , Gideon . " " I know . " Jeff left the kitchen . Rachel turned to Gideon , looked at him for a moment , and then went over to him . " Gideon ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran her hand down his arm . " I can stand near anything , Gideon , " she said softly . " But I ca n't stand to see you with misery . I been less and less use , but I ca n't stand to see you with misery . " Gideon took bearlike , desperate grasp , and her words came jaggedly , " Ca n't stand it , Gideon , ca n't  --  " " Rachel , Rachel , baby . " " You going to smile , Gideon ? " He smiled at her , and she lay against him , inertly , her fingers plucking at his shirt . The next morning , as Gideon stood with Jeff and Ellen , watching Hannibal Washington lay the bricks for the chimneyof the new house , Abner Lait stopped on his way in from town . Dropping his reins , he climbed out of his wagon and joined Gideon . " Where 'd you learn to slap that mortar ? " he asked HannibalWashington . " Learned from my pappy  --  he gone and built them seven stacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell ? "  | " Sure enough , " Hannibal Washington said . " That a long time ago , though . " " When 'd they build that old house ? " " Fifty years ago , sure enough . " " Seems like it been there forever , " Abner said , plucking at Gideon 's sleeve . Gideon walked over behind the wagon with him , and the white man said , " I just come from town , Gideon . Seems you were right , President made his deal with that damned old son of a bitch , Wade Hampton . The troops at Columbia got their marching orders  --  come April tenth , they 're going to entrain for the North . " " Who said that ? " " Well , look a here at this newspaper , " Abner told him , reaching into the wagon , pulling out a newspaper , and pointing to the headline : SOUTH WINS SECOND EMANCIPATION . " There it is , the whole story . The town 's full of talk . Jason Hugar 's strutting around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory parade at Columbia . You said make no trouble ; well , I made no trouble , just watched that son of a bitch , Hugar . Where 'd he fight ? I been on a hell of a lot of fields , but never saw no man called Hugar . " Gideon was reading the story , scanning the lines quickly and nervously  --  " in amiable agreement with the governor , President Hayes set his signature to an order which finally establishes democracy and home rule in the south . The last Federal troops will be withdrawn on the tenth of April  --  " " It 's going to be a picnic , " Abner Lait muttered . " What ? " " You know , Gideon , my grandpappy should have gone west . Old Dan Boone come down here and just beg him to go over into Kentuck . Hell no , my smart grandpappy said . Jesus God , I wish he 'd gone  --  I wish he 'd gone into Kentuck and into Illinois and right across the whole God damned country and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to that blue Pacific Ocean , I wish  --  " " Shut up , " Gideon said , nodding at where Ellen stood . Hannibal Washington and Jeff were looking at them . " What are you going to do , Gideon ? " " Today 's the sixth , is n't it ? We 've got four days . I 'm goingP213to Columbia . I do n't know what I 'll do there ; I 'll try to do something . " When Gideon finished writing out the telegram in the Western Union office , on Sumter Street in Columbia , he handed it across the counter to the clerk . The clerk was a pimply-faced boy of nineteen . " Read it back to me , please , " Gideon said . The boy looked at him and made no move . " I said , read it , please . " The boy read : " RUTHERFORD B HAYES ' THE WHITE HOUSEWASHINGTON DCMR PRESIDENT I BESEECH YOU TO DELAY YOUR ACTION WITHDRAWING FEDERAL TROOPS FROM COLUMBIA STOP ABOLITION OF NEGRO AND POOR WHITE MILITIA LEAVES PRO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TERROR STOP LOYAL REPUBLICANS HERE CAN NOT COMPREHEND ABANDONMENT OF ALL UNION ELEMENTS IN SOUTH ; AWE PLEAD YOUR HELP AND SYMPATHY vGIDEON JACKSONREPRESENTATIVE FOR SOUTH CAROLINA " " How much is it ? " Gideon asked . The boy hesitated , then said , " Ten dollars . " Gideon looked at him a moment , paid him and left . The boy walked back to the operator and boasted , " Never seen a nigger yet knew what a telegram cost . " " God damn you if I do n't have you fired for that ! How much he give you ? " " Ten . " " Well , you going to split , God damn well . Give it here . " The boy handed over the telegram and the operator glanced at it . He whistled and read it more carefully . " Who gave you this ? " " Some big nigger . " " Well , look . You take this over to Judge Clayton . Tell him " Sure enough , " Hannibal Washington said . " That a long time ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old house ? " " Fifty years ago , sure enough . " " Seems like it been there forever , " Abner said , plucking at Gideon 's sleeve . Gideon walked over behind the wagon with him , and the white man said , " I just come from town , Gideon . Seems you were right , President made his deal with that damned old son of a bitch , Wade Hampton . The troops at Columbia got their marching orders  --  come April tenth , they 're going to entrain for the North . " " Who said that ? " " Well , look a here at this newspaper , " Abner told him , reaching into the wagon , pulling out a newspaper , and pointing to the headline : SOUTH WINS SECOND EMANCIPATION . " There it is , the whole story . The town 's full of talk . Jason Hugar 's strutting around in an army uniform , going to march in the victory parade at Columbia . You said make no trouble ; well , I made no trouble , just watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he fight ? I been on a hell of a lot of fields , but never saw no man called Hugar . " Gideon was reading the story , scanning the lines quickly and nervously  --  " in amiable agreement with the governor , President Hayes set his signature to an order which finally establishes democracy and home rule in the south . The last Federal troops will be withdrawn on the tenth of April  --  " " It 's going to be a picnic , " Abner Lait muttered . " What ? " " You know , Gideon , my grandpappy should have gone west . Old Dan Boone come down here and just beg him to go over into Kentuck . Hell no , my smart grandpappy said . Jesus God , I wish he 'd gone  --  I wish he 'd gone into Kentuck and into Illinois and right across the whole God damned country and out of here . I wish he 'd gone out of here to that blue Pacific Ocean , I wish  --  " " Shut up , " Gideon said , nodding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at them . " What are you going to do , Gideon ? " " Today 's the sixth , is n't it ? We 've got four days . I 'm goingP213to Columbia . I do n't know what I 'll do there ; I 'll try to do something . " X , " How much is it ? " Gideon asked . The boy hesitated , then said , " Ten dollars . " Gideon looked at him a moment , paid him and left . The boy walked back to the operator and boasted , " Never seen a nigger yet knew what a telegram cost . " " God damn you if I do n't have you fired for that ! How much he give you ? " " Ten . " " Well , you going to split , God damn well . Give it here . " The boy handed over the telegram and the operator glanced at it . He whistled and read it more carefully . " Who gave you this ? " " Some big nigger . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell himWhen Gideon finished writing out the telegram in the Western Union office , on Sumter Street in Columbia , he handed it across the counter to the clerk . The clerk was a pimply-faced boy of nineteen . " Read it back to me , please , " Gideon said . The boy looked at him and made no move . " I said , read it , please . " The boy read : " RUTHERFORD B HAYESTHE WHITE HOUSEWASHINGTON DCMR PRESIDENT I BESEECH YOU TO DELAY YOUR 1s ACTION WITHDRAWING FEDERAL TROOPS FROM COLUMBIA STOP ABOLITION OF NEGRO AND POOR WHITE MILITIA LEAVES PRO RECONSTRUCTION FORCES DEPENDENT ON FEDERAL PROTECTION STOP FEAR RIOTING AND TERROR STOP LOYAL REPUBLICANS HERE CAN NOT COMPREHEND ABANDONMENTOF ALL UNION ELEMENTS IN SOUTHWE PLEAD YOUR HELP AND SYMPATHY t ' GIDEON JACKSON REPRESENTATIVE FOR SOUTH CAROLINA  --  P214I want to know if I should send it . And keep your big mouth shut ! " In about twenty minutes , the boy was back . " The judge kept the telegram and give me a dollar . " " You split ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut , or he 'd know the reason why . " From the telegraph office , Gideon went to see Colonel J. L. Williams , in command of the Federal troops . The colonel was a busy man that day ; it was an hour and a half before Gideon was shown in . Then he said , " Representative , I 'm sorry . Every one in the South wants to talk to me today . " I know , " Gideon nodded . " I do n't know how different my case is . Here is a copy of a telegram I sent to the president . An answer may come in a day or in ten days  --  until it comes , I beg of you not to let all your troops entrain . " The colonel read the telegram and then shook his head . " My orders  --  " " I know you have orders , Colonel , " Gideon said . " I 'm not asking a personal favor . This is a matter of life and death to a great many people . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm sorry . " " Do you know what will follow when your troops leave ? " " Whatever I may think will follow , " the colonel said , " I have to obey my orders . " If you took this up with General Hampton , in command of the district  --  " " That would be useless , " Gideon said . " He would not . I know what orders mean . I 've been in the army , Colonel . " " It 's no use . " " Do n't you see that the president can not ignore the tele-gram . " " I could be court martialed . " " I have some influence in Washington . " " I ca n't do it ! " the colonel said , raising his voice . " Believe me , sir , however much I might want to , I ca n't do it . Do n't you think I have eyes to see ? I 'm a soldier , I 'm not a poli-tician ! " For a moment , Gideon stood there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm sorry . "   " So am I , " the colonel said . Then Gideon left . He remained in Columbia until the tenth of the month , making frequent visits to the telegraph office . On the ninth , he sent a second wire . On the tenth , he watched the troops march to the waiting train , and then he went back to Carwell. slowlyand enjoying the fine spring afternoon . Anyway , he was a man who liked to walk his horse whenever possible , especially if the weather showed any signs of turning hot . At some point , on the way back from town , someone had stepped up to the slow-moving wagon and fired both barrels of a shotgun at Zeke Hale 's head . The noise of the gun had caused the horse to bolt forward , pitching Zeke back into the wagon . The horse had run all the way back to the place , and Franny Hale had looked into the wagon and seen whata shotgun fired at close range can do to a man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time in nine years , the men who lived at Carwell went to their work with guns slung over their shoulders . On the afternoon of the fifteenth of April , the people of Carwell heard a woman shrieking . Her loud , shrill screams echoed across the place , bringing people running from many directions . A terror-stricken boy , pushing through the woods , whimpered , " The horse came back , he came back . " The peoplefollowed this boy , Juddy Hale , to his father 's farm . His father , Zeke Hale , was a stolid colored man , a quiet familyman who farmed well and turned over a larger net cash cot-h-ko ton profit than almost anyone on the place . There they found r Franny Hale , his wife , screaming loudly and insanely . There they found a wagon with a horse harnessed to it , and when they saw what was inside it , they turned away . They pieced the story together . Zeke Hale had gone to town to buy some new shoes and a present for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had been driving backP216How Gideon Jackson Fought the Good FightIT WAS THE MORNING OF THE EIGHTEENTH OF APRIL , 1877 , ATCarwell . The mist lay in the valleys and ran like white milk through the cypress groves . Four pointers , out hunting most of the night , loped wearily home through the pines . The high-pitched call of the roosters met them , and crows winged overhead crying , caw , caw , caw to the dawning . Then men at the various farms , milking and doing the other pre-dawn chores , thought all the thoughts that had always , from time out of memory , been a part of such morning work , would it be a fair day or a muggy dayould Nelly try to kick the bucket over , she always tried , would that fool dog across the valley get tired of his hollow belling , how fine and simple and good the voice of the crows is , just the same and just as nostalgically pleasing morning after morning , would there be bacon or fried chicken with the grits this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , would the rheumatismdown near the small of the back start acting up again  --  noneof these thoughts very complicated , none of them very important , yet none of them entirely unimportant . The sun raised over the brow of a hill , and light came with a sudden and glorious rush . In hilly country , the light splashes on one side of a slope while the other stays in shadow . The mists in the valleys churn and vanish , except where they cling to the watery bottom of a swamp hole . The snakes , copperhead , blacks , and others crawled gratefully toward the warmth ; the fat terrapins came out into the sunlight . The rabbits crawled deep into the bramble patches , and the squirrels raced up and down the fine old hickories . The deer moved away to the thickets to bed down and rest . P217Morning at Carwell , after the chores were done , found the men sitting down to breakfast , hot cakes , pan bread , molasses , white , cold butter with little drops of water standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes fried chicken or fried fresh fish , buttermilk heavy with clods of turning , milk , fried potatoes , yellow cornmeal mush cut in slices from the pan where it had set since the night before , fried in the bacon grease  --  all of those foods in some combination were breakfast at Carwell , and not too much for men who had already worked two or three hours . The schoolbell called for the children ; they took shortcuts , no roads for them . They were filled with life at eight o'clock , pushing ankle deep through the ploughing , whooping to each other , shouting as they raced up a hillside , chucking cones at each other as they cut through a neck of piney woods . Their incredible , violent , unpredictable energy made each day a rather awesome adventure for Benjamin Winthrope . He tugged the schoolbell to give himself courage , and philosophizedthat anyone could teach well-behaved , gentle students . He thought of Frank Carson 's daughter , sixteen years old , staring at him boldly all day with those round , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things that went on inside of himself . The Congregational Educational Service that had dispatched him to Carwell spoke of it as God 's work , and after only a few months here he could understand why God had relegated the duty . He took comfort in his few prize students , Hannibal Washington 's son , Jamie , Abner Lait 's daughter , two or three more . Today , he would introduce the upper levels to Emerson . " Emerson , " he repeatedto himself , standing in front of the school . listening to the children 's shouting , and letting his eyes roam over the sundrenched fields and woods . " Emerson , " he told himselffirmly . At the breakfast table , talking to Marcus , Gideon thought vagrantly of how adaptable the human mechanism is , how easily the bizarre can become the normal , and how complete is the adjustment to almost any condition . He was saying to Marcus :   " I would add an acre of tobacco , not cotton , " talking like that , matter of factly , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the men to leave . " This ai n't tobacco country . " " Still , " Gideon said , " we grow a good leaf . Not as fine as Piedmont or Virginia , I admit that , but it 's marketable . These new things they call cigarettes are going to increase smoking . " " It 's bad for soil . " " So is cotton . You sicken your soil in either case unless you rotate or leave the fields fallow . I 've been preaching that for years . " Rachel said , " If it was my doing , I 'd plant corn . " " We 're not stock farmers . " " Got to go on doing what your grandpappy did ? " " I want to go for buying this afternoon , " Jenny said . " To town ? " " Uh-huh . " Marcus shook his head . " Why ? " " There 'll be some folks going in later on in the week , " Gideon told her . " This is a fine day . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well I do n't take orders from you . I do n't have to stay anywhere for you telling me . " " You stay here ! " Jenny began to sob . Ellen , who had been sitting next to her , fondled her hand . Gideon rose , then Marcus . As he started from the room , Gideon glanced toward the rifles , hesitated , then picked one up and went out with it . At ten o'clock , Jeff was at the home of Marion Jefferson . His wife , Louise , had broken out with boils all over her hands ; they were nothing serious , but they were painful and itchy and kept her awake nights . Jeff told her how to mix a soothing paste , and then he lingered on the porch to pass the time of the day with Marion . As a boy , Jeff had been one of Marion 's favorites ; now , as a doctor , he was like a God inp219Marion 's eyes . As they stood there , talking about one thing and another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , panting , took a deep swallow , and said : " Jeff , I just seen Jason Hugar and Sheriff Bentley headed for your pappy 's place . I been standing on the rise , and sure as God I could n't miss the sheriff 's gig . The other man 's Jason Hugar , I swear . " " Well , it 's nothing to be alarmed about , " Jeff told him . " Maybe it is , maybe it ai n't , " Marion said . " Just suppose we ride up there in your chaise . " He went inside the house for his rifle . His wife , frightened , asked , " What is it ? What you going to do ? " " It ai n't a thing , not near , " he smiled . " Just the sheriff riding over to Gideon 's . We going up there to make sure . " " Do n't make no trouble , Marion . We had enough of trouble . " " We sure enough did , " he told her quietly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at all . All the same , I guess you better walk over and tell Abner Lait the sheriff 's up at Gideon 's . " Cutting a tall pine out by its roots , digging around it , and then chopping at the fat , moist tendrils , had employed Gideonand Marcus since they left the breakfast table . It was good work for the cool morning ; it let a man give himself to the ax , taking his anger out in the best way , on inanimate objects that in no way resented it . When the pine fell , they would leave it lie all through the spring and summer , and when the leaves were turning it would be fine and crisp for cutting , ready to be marked off into four-foot logs that burned like paper . Now it had begun to totter , its long stem vibrating ever so slightly , when Marcus spied the sheriff 's little gig , wheeling up from the swamp and taking the climb to the Jackson house . He dropped his ax and pointed . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiss gig . I 'm going up to see . " Gideon nodded ; they picked up their guns and walked quickly toward the house . When the shoulder of the hill hid them from the road , they broke into a run , and , panting , r reached the house just a moment or two after the gig got there . Jason Hugar and the sheriff sat together , their sleeves rolled up , both of them wearing leather vests , each of them with a double barreled shotgun across his knees . Rachel was on the porch , tense , worried , breathing a sigh of relief when she saw Gideon and Marcus . " Morning , sheriff , " Gideon said . Jenny and Ellen came out on the porch and stood behind Rachel . Fracus , their spotted pointer , made a fool of himself over Marcus until he saw that he was neither noticed nor wanted , and then he lay down and watched . Marcus stood with his gun hanging through the crook of his arm , tight , bent , and only Rachel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stable yet ready to explode . Nodding at Gideon 's rifle , the sheriff said : " Going hunting , Gideon ? " " Maybe so ! " Marcus snapped . " And when you talk to my father , call him mister , understand ? " " Mister , " Jason Hugar drawled . " Mister . " " That 's right . " " All right , mister , " Hugar smiled . " What can I do for you , sheriff ? " Gideon asked softly . " There you are , " Bentley nodded . " For my money , you 're a reasonable man , Gideon , and my God , if that ai n't a virtue these days , I do n't know what is . No use losing our heads . I got a job to do and come up here on a small matter of business  --  and find you menacing the law with guns . Jesus Christ , Gideon , that ai n't a way for niggers , it leads to trouble  --  " Marcus said , " Shut your God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hugar said . " Now look , you nigger bastard , " his finger curled across both triggers of the shotgun . " If you make one move with that bird gun of yours , I 'm going to rip the God damn guts out of you  --  " Rachel cried out , half a whimper ; Gideon gripped Marcus ' shoulder so that the boy felt the fingers sink in , like iron claws . " Just take it easy , Mr. Hugar , " Gideon said . " There 's no cause for trouble . Sheriff Bentley knows that ; he knows we 're law-abiding folk and never gave him any cause forp221trouble . If we 're carrying guns , it 's not out of disrespect for the law ; it 's because a neighbor of ours was murdered just a few days ago . " " Tell you something , Gideon , " Bentley said . " When a nigger gets too high , it makes trouble . The way you folks have it , that nigger was just driving along the road when someone up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , Gideon , it do n't make one bit of sense . How in hell 's name do I know what he was up to ? Give a nigger one inch and he 'll take the shirt off your back . " " That 's why we 're here , " Hugar agreed . " Why are you here ? " Gideon demanded . " God damn you , we 'll ask the questions ! " " Now take it easy , Jason , " the sheriff said evenly . " Gideon'sgot a right to ask questions ; we 're on his property ; that 's a legal matter of law . But we got a right to ask questionstoo . We want to settle what we 're here for quiet and peaceable . Yesterday afternoon , Gideon , three niggers come up to the back door of Clark Hasting 's house . Clark 's in the store ; Sally and the little girl are there at home . Just as nice as pie , one of the niggers says , please , Miss Sally , we 're a hungering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you never known Clark to turn a nigger away , and Sally goes to fetch something , never thinking . Meanwhile , Clark 's girl , nine years old , stands there , watching the niggers  --  " At that point , Jeff , Trooper and Marion Jefferson came riding up in the chaise . Gideon was heartened when he saw them . Marion and Jeff got out ; Trooper sat in the chaise , gripping his Spencer , the same one he had carried in the war , and said , in his slow , deep voice , " Take your finger off the trigger of that shotgun , Hugar . " The man 's face reddened ; a vein swelled out , a vertical band across his brow ; his whole square body tightened . " Take it off quick , " Trooper said . Bentley whispered , " Do n't be a damn fool and do as he says . " Abner Lait came riding up on his plough-horse , a shotgunover his shoulder . " Do as he says , " Bentley told him . Hugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun at your feet , " Trooper said . " You , too , sheriff . " " You ca n't talk  --  " " At your feet , " Trooper nodded . They put the guns at their feet . Abner Lait joined the group around the gig . Frank Carson 's wagon turned the corner of the road , up from the swamp . Hugar said : " We got to remember some things , Lait . " " I got something to remember . " " The sheriff was telling us , " Gideon said , " just why he 's here . " Gideon repeated what the sheriff had said . " Go on , sir , " Gideon told him . " We want to hear the rest . " Frank Carson joined them . Bentley , watching them narrowly , continued , " The little girl stands there , watching them , and one of the niggers goes for her , rips her dress off . She began to scream , and Sally came running . One of the other niggers hits Sally . Sally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the niggers take to their heels . " " And how does that concern us ? " Gideon asked . " The niggers were recognized , and they all of them came from up here , at Carwell . " At first , there was dead silence . Then Abner Lait laughed . Then Jeff began , " Of all the insane  --  " " Keep quiet , " Gideonsaid . " I 'll do the talking . " And he asked Bentley , " What do you want ? " " We want them three niggers , Gideon . " " On what charge ? " " Assault and attempted rape . " " Who are these men you charge ? " Gideon asked . " Hannibal Washington , Andrew Sherman , and another nigger Sally says she seen in the store with Carwell niggers , but do n't remember the name . " " All right , " Gideon said . " We wo n't talk about your story ; it does n't concern me . But neither of the two men has been over to town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over by the schoolhouse , laying bricks . Andrew Sherman is ploughing and has twenty witnesses . P223These men will bear me out . So there are your charges , sheriff . No one from Carwell was in town yesterday . " " We ai n't taking nigger witness , " Hugar said . Gideon 's mouth tightened . Abner Lait walked over to the gig , " I 'm not a nigger , Hugar . Look close . " " We ai n't taking your witness either . " " A long time ago I made up my mind to kill you , you dirty son of a bitch , " Abner said quietly . - ' Bentley said , " That talk wo n't get us nowhere . We don'twant trouble , Gideon . " " We do n't want trouble either . " " But we aim to take those men back . They 're going to get fair witness and fair trial . " " You have fair witness here , " Gideon said . 1/ . " I 'm going to make an arrest . Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way if you want to , " Gideon nodded . " I 'm putting it that way . We came here peaceable on business of law and order . You surround us and offer us armed resistance . That 's a God damned serious thing , Gideon . " " You 're going back without those men , " Gideon said . " If , you want it , sheriff , you can have it . I say you 're lying . I say I no sane man could believe that cock and bull story you told . I say that . " " I hear you , " the sheriff nodded . " I can hear a nigger five miles off . I can smell one . I 'm going to have those men , Mikoes'N deon , If I got to deputize every man in the county . " off it ! " The men stood in a close group , watching the gig as it drove back along the road . For a while there was silence . Then Abne.r Lait began to curse , softly , fluently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should " It do n't matter , " Frank Carson shrugged . " This was a long time coming and it ai n't nothing a man says is going to change it . " " Or outside the county , " Gideon nodded . " Or every rot-tenscoundrel Hugar can lay hands on . Meanwhile , get outof Carwell , Bentley . You 're standing on our land . Get to hell " Every day I woke up this week , it was going to be like this , " Gideon reflected . " A whole week , and every day you think about it . Everyday , and then one morning it comes . " Standing around , subdued , quiet , not quite understanding why they had been dispossessed in the midst of a school day , the children watched the men enter the schoolhouse . A few of the older boys pushed in along with the men ; they were not stopped . Half the men who sat down in the pews carried weapons of one sort or another ; all of them moved slowly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts , their actions , and their hopes . BenjaminWinthrope stood at one side of the hall and watched them ; he was both disturbed and frightened . He was a young man , Williams , ' 73 ; he came of a very average , religious New England family that traced their descent from the old governor , although they spelled their name differently ; and coming from that sort of a family , complete within itself , the love he felt for his own humankind was more abstract than actual . It had taken a great strength of will , a constant strugglewith himself to remain here among these  --  to him  --  strange , quiet , yet violent people . Now , watching them , he saw as well as they did that all was over . His job was done ; he would go to the station and take a train , today , if possible . Brother Peter opened the meeting by saying , " Brethren , we are gathered here today in fear and anger . God help us to choose the right way  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us strength to bear with it . You going to talk , Gideon ? " Rising from where he sat , toward the back , Gideon answered , " This is n't a matter just for me alone . I can talk no better than anyone else . I know no more of what we should do than my neighbor does . The people can talk for them-selves . " The heads turned to look at Gideon . He seemed older now than he ever had before . Hannibal Washington spoke up , " Maybe it 's better you should talk for the people , Gideon . A man comes from us or he do n't ; you come from us , Gideon . You never gone away . You got your faults , GodP225knows , but you walk low and humble , Gideon , God knows . Go on and talk . " " There is n't much to talk about , " Gideon said . " You all know what happened . You know why , too . You know that if they take three of our people away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Andrew Sherman said tiredly , " I do n't want to make no trouble for all , Gideon . Ai n't we had enough trouble ? Maybe they ai n't going to do something so bad as hanging . Suppose I go in there to town and they look at me , and they say , no , that ai n't the same nigger ? How they going to say I 'm the nigger did those things ? I never been off the place yesterday or all the week before ? " " They 'll hang you , " Abner Lait said . " Just as sure as God , they 'll hang you . " " They 'll hang you , " Gideon agreed . I 'll make no decisions from here on , the decisions are up to you . After that , if you want me to lead , I will . But you decide . That story  --  well , they had to tell some story ; they had to have some method that resembled legality . After all , it is only eight days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough time for them to shed all we 've built in eight years . " " Well , what do we do , Gideon ? " Frank Carson demanded . " That 's for you to decide . I think they 'll be back tonight  --  if not tonight , tomorrow , but they 'll be back , not two of them , but a good many more . Then they 'll start the business of smashing us , and after a little while they wo n't feel any need for legal methods . As to what you can do , there are several things . You can stay in your homes and be murdered by twos and threes  --  not all of you , some may escape . You can run away , and there 'll be a plantation somewhere you can hire on , for fatback and grits and a place to sleep , and if you keep your mouths shut , you can live that way . For the white men , it 's a little different ; perhaps they can join Jason Hugar , although I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not too different for the white men . Or else , you can stay together and fight ! " Jeff cried , " This is still the United States of America !   There is still law and there are still courts ! My God , sir , do we have to destroy ourselves ? " " We do n't have to , " Gideon said . " I gave the other alternatives . I 'm making no choices . For eight days there has been no law but the law of violence ; the courts are not ours  --  and only because this is America do we have the strength to fight ! Destruction ? I do n't know  --  when old Osawatomie Brown went into Harper 's Ferry with nineteen men , he had less strength and less hope than we have , but he shook this nation  --  he woke it up , he made men see . I do n't propose to fight to die ; I want to fight to live . I want to fight so that this whole country will see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , " Jeff said . " What other way ? " " If you went back to Washington ? " " I tried there and I failed , " Gideon said . " If you tried again ? " " I would fail again , and it would be too late . Tomorrow will be too late . " Will Boone said , softly and lazily , " Suppose we reckon to fight , Gideon . I like to stand up for mine ; that 's a good way as I see things . But how ? We ai n't an army  --  three and half thousand acres , you take in all the places . That 's a little thin , a little spread . " " I 've thought of that , " Gideon agreed . " God knows , I 've been thinking of little else . If we fight , it means putting the women and children where they 're safe , where they can be safe for a long while , long enough for this to get out , for this to burn . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defend , nearby  --  I mean the old Carwell House . It stands on a hill , it commands the countryside " I 've said enough , " Gideon finished . " Decide for your-selves . " An hour later , they had decided ; out of their strength and their weakness , their fear and anger , their hurt and pain and memory of their toil had come this , Abner Lait speaking after the welter of voices had quieted : " We 'll fight , Gideon . Do you stay with us ? "   " If you want me ? " Gideon said . " We want you . " Gideon looked around the hall , and then he nodded . His steps dragged as he walked up to the front of the room . Brother Peter watched him , the old man 's eyes full of pain . Gideon , glancing at his watch , said , " It is almost three o'clock now . Whatever we are going to do we should do before dark . I do n't know if they 'll come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this  --  that we take our families up to the big house , that we take food and blankets . We can leave them there with a guard during the day while we work our places . At least , we 'll know they 're safe . We 'll use the school bell for an alarm , but I would not use the schoolhouse  --  " He turned to Benjamin Winthrope . " I do n't know how you feel about this , Mr. Winthrope . Certainly this is not your concern . We shall have to discontinue the school for the time being . " Winthrope , rubbing his hands uneasily , answered , " I 'm not an advocate of violence , Mr. Jackson . I do n't approve of what you are doing , but it 's not my affair . But you ca n't have the children run wild , all of them together in one place  --  " " There 's nothing else we can do . " Winthrope , resignedly , said , " I 'll stay for a while until things are orderly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you want to stay , we 'd be thankful . " He turned to the people , " Take whatever powder and shot you have up to the house . I would say take cornmeal , smoked meat  --  whatever you can move conveniently . " They left the schoolhouse the way they had come in , slowly , not talking much ; each man gathered his children to himself as he walked or rode back to his house . Coming out , Trooper stopped Gideon and said : " I ai n't leaving my place . " " Why ? " The huge black man , standing inches higher than Gideon , inches broader , a great , slow mass of a man , shook his head . " I ai n't leaving , Gideon . " " That 's up to you , " Gideon said .   Word by word , Trooper let it out . " I ai n't like you , Gideon . When I 'm a slave , that lash come down harder on me than anyone else , you big black bastard , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the time that . Mr. Dudley Carwell buy me at auction in Orleans . Pay a higher price any other man bring . Work me harder too . Work me morning , noon and night . Never see happy sunrise , never see happy nighttime ; when there 's whipping , old overseer say , whip that black bastard for example , wo n't hurt him none . " He pulled off his shirt . " Look at that back , Gideon ! " Brother Peter and a few others had stopped to listen ; they looked at the back that had whip scars all over it , like a moulded relief map . " I ai n't going off my place , Gideon . Me and my woman , we break our damn backs turning over that dirt . Got a piece of dirt 's all my own . Got no master , got no overseer . Sometimes , I feel like kneeling me down and kissing that there earth , sure enough . Got a house my own ; sit down there and woman brings me food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  just my own house . I 'm going to stay there , Gideon . Ai n't nobody going to move me out of there . " " And your children ? " Brother Peter asked . " They going to stay . Ai n't no harm going to come to them . " Eight years ago , Gideon would have stormed and pleaded ; now he said , " All right , Trooper . If that 's what you want , all right . " During all the long afternoon of that day , April eight- eenth , the people of Carwell moved from their farms to theplantation house . Women filled wagons with bedding , pots , food , a few small , treasured household things , a calendar , abook or a Bible , a sewing basket , a plaster of paris figure , abright Currier and Ives print . There was not much talk nowabout this thing , which they had talked about so much forweeks . Even the children , though filled with excitement bythis one earth-shaking event in their simple , slow-movinglives , were more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploding over small and unimportant matters , a tool misplaced , a child underfoot ; women became furious over nothing : while the great and single fact was accepted without comment , without tears . A family , loaded down in its wagon , drove slowly toward the hill , and waved at another family coming from another direction . One by one , the wagons converged on the house . When they were all there , the old , white , porticoed building gleamed all pink and golden in the setting sun . Gideon took a few books , not many . Jeff took his instruments and some of the medicines he had bought in Charleston . They laid out the bedding on the big hay wagon , makingpoor Fred McHugh as comfortable as they could . They took all their arms , Gideon 's army Spencer , Marcus ' cavalrycarbine , two shotguns , and a heavy , long-barreled Colt revolver that Gideon had bought in Washington the year before . They took Rachel 's best pans and most of their householdlinen . Rachel had wanted to leave that behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gideon had been buying it , a little at a time , knowing how much she loved the feel of smooth white sheets and pillow cases : but Jeff said , " Take it all , " offering no explanation . Abner Lait said to Jimmy , his nineteen-year-old son , " What do you think ? These ai n't the times they were ten years ago . I 'm stringing with Gideon because it 's kind of become a habit . You do n't have to . " A year before Gideon had helped Abner to buy an extra hundred-acre piece for Jimmy to move onto when he married . Now the boy reminded him . " I know that . It 's no skin off your back . " " I 'll go along with you . " Abner nodded and laid an arm across the boy 's shoulder . That was a rare show of affection . The boy shrugged it off and went into the house to help his mother . Brother Peter and the Allenby boys were among the first to arrive at the big house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much , weathered it some , peeled off some of the paint . From a distance , the building had its old dignity and beauty , almost unimpaired ; but when you came closer you saw that the windows were broken , the weeds grown higher , the doors hanging from their hinges . All of the furnishings had been sold at auction , but emptiness could not entirely displace the former grandeur . The big central staircase , with its mahagony banisters and oaken treads was if anything more impressive in the emptiness . The old hand-blocked wallpaper hung in leafs and shreds , but its color remained . The wonderfully-carved walnut dados seemed waiting , patiently , to be backed once more with cabinets , chairs , and sofas , and here and there the fine hardwoodfloors showed through the years ' accumulation of dirt , dead leaves , and refuse brought in by the children who had played in the empty rooms . Being encumbered by few possessions , Brother Peter had been able to make the change quickly . The three boys , who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him , and soon they were at work with brooms , cleaning the place . After a while , others joined them . The accumulateddebris of a dozen years is n't quickly disposed of , but by the time the families were arriving in any numbers , a sort of neatness prevailed in the big house . Gideon took charge of the incoming folk . While there were more than twenty rooms , it would still mean a communal sort of life . The men would sleep in what had formerly been the main reception room . Keeping the families together as much as possible , he divided the women and small children among the many bedrooms . In some cases , such as that of Jake Sutter , where there was a grandmother , a wife , a sister and three daughters , he gave the family a room for itself . An overflow of the men would sleep in the dining room along with the teen-age boys ; in the daytime , the room would be used for meals and as a schoolhouse . The food was put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of women to apportion it and supervise the cooking . Another group of women set about cleaning the place . Men put paper patches over the broken windows , and Hannibal Washington and two others climbed down into the cistern and set about making it usable . Since the cistern was enclosedby the two back wings of the house , only a step fromP231the kitchen door , Gideon saw no reason why it should n't be used to store all the water they needed , instead of relyingon barrels in the house . It was clean by the time the sun set , and Hannibal Washington set a crew of boys to filling it from the well . Meanwhile , Gideon sent half a dozen wagons back for cordwood . Some of the people , those who had small children , had brought cows with enough fodder to last them at least a few days . Since the Carwell barns and stables had been burned down long ago , Gideon put the cows and horses in the space between the wings , and made a fence for them out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightfall , and the very fact of that accomplishment cheered the people immensely . Except for Winthrope , there were no strangers here ; those of the people who had not known each other from birth had at least been intimate for many years . Habits and mannerisms that would have been peculiar and annoyingto others were not so to them . There was a novelty that buoyed them up in this being together , in sharing each other 's problems , in being able to sit talking much later into the night than had been their habit . The old chandeliers had not been removed from the Carvell house ; Gideon was wasteful of candles this night ; he had two dozen put in each of the main chandeliers , and the bright glow that came sparklingthrough the cut glass gave a merry and cheerful atmosphereto the place . Gideon broke down the men into committees . Ten would be sufficient to stay by the house , which meant , including the older boys , that a man need only give one day a week to this . They could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , it threw a pall of depression over them ; they were content with tomorrow or the next day . A committee would see to the horses , another would be a sort of judicial board in the house itself . Things might go well tonight , but after a while this living together would get on people 's nerves , and there would be squabbles and disputes to settle . There was much , too , that the children could do , a thousand small tasks which would keep them out of mischief .   Out of boxes and boards , Gideon had made himself a sort of table . Many of the people had brought chairs , a simpleand needful thing for elementary comfort . When the confusion of the first meal cooked and served together in the house had passed , Gideon sat himself down to write a series of telegrams . He would send one to the editor of the New York Herald ; Bennett had dispatched reporters through hell and high water before to get stories not half so good as the one that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another to the secretary of state , another to Frederick Douglass , the old and venerable Negro leader . One to Cardozo , describing the impending situation and make a last plea for unity and common action by every decent force in the South . In the message to Cardozo , he said , " I beg of you , Francis , to remember that we are not alone , that thousands of good and just men in the South , both black and white , can be inspired and united by the fact that here at Carwell , people have refused to accept tyranny and terror as the inevitable course of things . " He sent a telegram to Ralph Waldo Emerson , that the old man lift his voice once more in the cause of justice . As each was written , he passed it among the men to read and comment on . And when he had finally finished , he took Marcus aside and told him : " I want you to do this , son . It 's important . " Marcus nodded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go tonight , and you can be there when the Western Union office opens in the morning . Take the mare ; Abner will let you use his saddle . Whatever happens , Marcus , boy , see that the wires are sent . Then get back here . " " I 'll get back here , " Marcus said . Gideon walked outside with him before he left . Marcus wore high boots ; he had the big Colt revolver in his jacket pocket with the telegrams . He had said his offhand goodbys , supremely assured of his own ability to do a thing . Now he was alive and eager with excitement ; it was a fine moonlit night , a fine night for a ride to Columbia . The little mare could run like the wind ; nothing would stop him , nothingp233could catch him , and in a few ' hours people all over the land would know what was happening at Carwell . Gideon watched him with pride ; this was his son , this clean-limbed young man , unafraid , alive , proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The time to come would take care of itself . " You 're not afraid ? " he asked Marcus , and the boy just smiled . Jeff came out as he was mounting . " Good luck , " Jeff said , squeezing the boy 's thigh , smiling at him . " Thank you , doctor , " Marcus grinned , the same elusive note , part of sarcasm , part of respect in his voice . " I 'll bring you back a box of pills . " Then he was off , walking his horse down the hillside , past the decaying ruins that had been the slave cabins . Shortly after that , Gideon lay down on his pallet in the reception room . It was strange to be lying there with the hoarse breathing and the restless movements of many men all around him . The silvery moonlight , streaming in through the tall windows , gave an added dream quality to the place . It took Gideon back to the time , so long ago now , when he had been in the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way from Carwell , a long way from young and lovely Rachel , a long way from the children he had left behind  --  because a time comes when a man does what he must . Thinking that way , of one thing and another that had happened long ago , Gideon fell asleep  --  to be awakened , how much later he did not know , by the sound of many shots echoing across the valley . Shots that went on intermittentlyuntil there was silence again . Katie , Trooper 's wife , would say nothing to him ; she loved him and yet she feared him . He was bigger and stronger than any man at Carwell , yet he could be gentle as a woman ; he could be moved to tears or to hot anger with equal ease . Katie put up with that ; she had a good life with her man ; she was small and plain , but Trooper was good to her , never sinned with other women , provided well , and had never raised a hand to her or the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he set his mind on something , that was that , and you could forget about it right there . When he said , no , he was n't going to take a surname as everyone else was ; Trooper was a name , a good enough name ; it had always been his name ; it would continue to be his name ; when he said that , you just had to take it , and it was no use to argue with him . When he said he was going to stay , Katie accepted the fact . She told her two little girls , " We going to stay right here . " Though her heart sank as she saw the families coming by on their way up to the plantationhouse , what could she do ? And as night fell , and Trooper'slittle cabin appeared to sink into a well of lonesomeness , Katie became more and more terror-stricken , though she hid her feelings from her husband . She did n't sleep at all that night . She lay awake and listening beside Trooper 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was his , who could take it away ? She lay there thinking of all the forces that would rear up , and as she lay there , as the minutes and hours passed by , she heard something . She woke Trooper . " Listen ! " " What that ? " He listened and he heard the quick , even thud of hoofbeats . He climbed out of bed , pulled on his pants , located his Spencer in the moonlight that streamed into the room , and started out , barefooted . " Where you going ? " Katie whispered . " Outside . You stay here ! " He went out and stood in front of the little house , gripping the rifle . Remembering that he had no cartridges , he went back and filled a pocket with them . The children stirred , and Trooper bent over them and soothed them . Katie watched him but said nothing . He went out of the house again and stood in the moonlight , listening , a giant of a man , bare from the waist up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He heard the hoofbeats stop . He heard them pick up again from the direction of Gideon 's house , and then grow softer as the pines swallowed the road . Then the road came over a bluff , bathed in moonlight , and there Trooper saw a body of men appear , at least thirty men bunched close together , P235all of them wearing white sheets and the pointed hoods of the Klan . He drew in his breath , cursed softly , but did not move . Then the road dipped out of sight again , and the hoofbeats stopped . That would be at Hannibal Washington 's house . They were close enough now so that Trooper could hear the faint noise of their voices . The hoofbeats picked up again  --  his house was the next on the road . Trooper braced himself , feet apart , his chest swelling slightly . In a little while , he saw them on the mottled , tree-shadowedroad . His dog began to bark , a fine setter that charged fearlessly and stupidly into the mass of horses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then droppingeven that pace when they saw Trooper . They saw him like a strange , inhuman column of shiny black . They saw his waist high , level rifle . For a long moment , they paused , and then they came on , very slowly . " What you want ? " he asked , his deep voice rumbling with hate and anger . Katie came to the doorway ; she saw the hooded men and began to sob hysterically . A man in the lead said , " We want Hannibal Washington , Andrew Sherman , and you . " " You see me , " Trooper said . " Put down that gun ! " " You see me , " Trooper repeated , his voice booming with hate now , like a resonant bass drum . " You on my land ! God damn you sons of bitches , get off my land ! " The setter , taking the note from his master 's voice , began to bark furiously , ripping at one of the horses . The horse reared . Someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A revolver cracked , and the dog rolled over on its back , twistingfrom side to side . Trooper , his face contorted with rage , snapped up his rifle and fired . One of the hooded men became loose in his saddle , wavered , and then slipped to the ground , hanging by one foot from his stirrup . The horses stamped nervously . A half a dozen rifles cracked at once . The bullets were like hammers on Trooper 's flesh , but he began to walk forward . The blood , in little rivulets , ran down Trooper 's massive chest . His wife was screaming hystericallynow . Someone yelled :   " Shoot the bastard ! " A rifle cracked again and Trooper staggered . The horses were milling around him now . He swung his rifle ; the upraisedarm to ward it off cracked like a dry twig . Trooper swung his rifle again , and the stock splintered on the man 's collarbone , driving the broken bone deep into his chest . It was difficult to fire at him now without the danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his rearing horse , and shook the screaming wretch as a dog shakes a rat . Another man slipped off his horse , jammed a shotgun muzzle against Trooper 's back , and fired . The giant body stiffened , then collapsed like an empty sack . The man he had just dragged from his horse lay on the ground , moaning with pain . The man with the broken arm and collarbone began to scream suddenly , wild , inhuman screams . They kept shooting into Trooper 's inert body . They were all dismountingnow . Katie ran from the house , trying to get to her husband . They caught her and tore off her thin nightdress . They got her down on the ground , clawing at her legs to pull them apart . Somehow , she twisted loose , and one of the hooded men , whimpering with excitement , brought down his rifle butt across her head . Her skull gave ; suddenly , she was dead , her limbs without meaning or direction . A man yelled : " You god damn crazy son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the dead , naked body that had become so quickly and completely useless . They gatheredaround the man with the broken collarbone . The one Trooper had shot was dead . This one was dying ; they stood there , watching him die , watching the blood well in a thick stream from a severed vein . They turned toward the house ; everything was so quiet now ! One of them went to the barn and returned with a pitchfork full of hay , which he tossed into the open doorway . Someone else struck a match . They kept feeding hay to the blaze , and presently the whole front of the house was burning . Then the children began to scream . Their fear , trapped inside of them until now , broke forth in the terrified wail/ing of those who fear without being able to know or understand the origins of their fear . The men stood around uneasily . " Kids in there , " someone said . Someone else remarked , " Too damned many nigger kids anyway . " " Well , where in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , they 're all up at the old Carwell house . " The man who had spoken first said , " Harry , you ride back to town and ask Bentley where in hell 's name is the bunch from Calhoun County ? He was going to have two hundred men up here tonight . Well , where in hell are they ? " And then he added , as an afterthought , " Tell him Matty Clark and Hep Lawson are dead . " Then he turned back to watch the burning house . All of the men in the reception room were awakened by the shots . They crowded up to the windows to look across the moonlit hillside that seemed still to echo and re-echo with the sound . They ran with their rifles out onto the broad veranda , peering through the hazy and beautiful moonlit night . Women called down from upstairs , " What is it ? What is it ? " The children were awake and chattering excitedly . A few of the men circled around the house , but found nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was three o'clock in the morning now and he knew that Marcus was miles away . Standing out on the porch now , he said to Abner Lait , " Where do you think it came from ? " " Sounded like down in the valley where Trooper has his place . " They remembered Trooper now , and the men looked at one another . " Jesus God , " Frank Carson said softly . Pointing , Hannibal Washington cried , " Look a there ! " There was a ruddiness in the night that grew and grew . It seemed to be a barn-fire at first , and then a tongue of flame licked up and they knew that something bigger than a stack of wood was burning . The glow reached up into the sky , until someone gave voice to what they had all been thinking ,   " Trooper 's house . " " His two kids  --  " They started off the veranda with a rush , but Gideon called them back . " Do n't loose your heads ! For God 's sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hannibal , could you slip down there and see what happened ? " Hannibal Washington nodded and darted away , a small , deft shadow of a man that disappeared in the moonlight . There was silence after he left , only some of the men watchingGideon . " We stay together from here on , " Gideon said . " You wanted me to lead you , then take my orders or find someone else . " " All right , Gideon , " Abner said gently . " James , Andrew , Ezra , each of you take one side of this place , stand out about thirty yards from the house and sing out if you hear or see anything . " The three men moved off . Some of the women came out onto the veranda and whispered to the men ; they were sent back ; they were told to get the children back to sleep . But there was no more sleep for anyone at Carwell that night . As time passed and nothing happened , the men broke into little groups , discussing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them sat down on the broad steps of the house , and others leaned against the Doric columns that ranged up so majestically into the night . All of them kept scanning the hillside where Hannibal Washington had disappeared , and presently , about an hour after he had left , they saw a man moving . " Hannibal ? " He came up panting , wet from head to foot with dew ; he had to get his breath first , before he could tell them all he had seen . " Where 's the children ? " He shook his head . " Burned , I guess . " He said , " I crawled as near as I could  --  I seen the bodies just as clear . I heard them talking . " " What did you hear ? " Gideon asked dully . " They 're waiting for about two hundred men comingp239from over in Calhoun County . ' The Klan branch south of here , maybe Georgia folk , I guess , are supposed to send some men up . They know we 're here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vomit ; he hung over the veranda , retching constantly in a couvulsive , aching rhythm . The glow was dying now , but a few of the men were straining their eyes in another direction . There , above the dark trees , a new spot of rosy red appeared ; as it swelled , the men turned , one by one , to look at Abner Lait . He stood on the porch , his big red fists clenched , biting his lower lip until a trickle of blood ran down his chin . Then , though his long , sunburned face did not move , he began to cry , the tears welling out over his lean cheeks . He spoke in a whisper : " The bastards  --  all I had , all I ever wanted to have , God damn them bastards , God damn them  --  a man works , builds , plans , dreams , God damn them  --  " Hannibal Washington said , " Gideon , why do n't we stop them before they burn every house on the place ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gideon nodded . " They want us to come out of here . " " I 'm going down there , " Abner Lait said . " You 're not . We let Trooper stay , and he 's lying there dead now and his wife next to him . " " I 'm going , Gideon . " Gideon 's voice was level and cold . " You 're not  --  " There was something now . Ezra Golden sang out ; they could hear the dull hoofbeats of many horses at a walk , and then through the haze loomed the ghostly outlines of the hooded men . They . halted at a hundred and fifty yards , a mass of white-cloaked riders , more than twenty now , many more . " Hello there ! " " What do you want ? " Gideon called out . " Who are you ? " The words floated through the night , rising , falling . " You damn well know who we are , Jackson ! We want those men ! " " It 's no use to answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "   " We 're coming up to get them , Jackson ! We 're going to get them or burn every house on the place ! " Gideon said sharply , " Spread out around the house ! Keep down in the weeds ! Do n't fire until they 're at fifty yards ! " The men spread out , crouching down in the dry spring stems and shrubs . Those on the veranda lay at full length . Gideon , Abner and Brother Peter stood next to one of the columns . Gideon glanced at Abner ; he was sighting on his rifle , a long , old , but accurate Sharps percussion gun . He stood as motionless as a rock , yet the tears still ran across his cheeks . " God forgive us , " Brother Peter said , " God forgive us . " Gideon lifted his Spencer and sighted ; how long was it since he had looked across those sights at a man ? In all the world there was nothing so insane , so unreasonable as killing ; yet that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line surged forward , a quick trot at first and then slower . At one hundred yards , Abner Lait 's long rifle flashed and a man slumped from his horse . The men in white began to fire . At seventy-five yards , there was a crackle of answeringshots from around the house , in spite of Gideon 's warning . Another man fell from his horse ; another screamed in pain . The white line stopped , hesitated , and then galloped away , fading into the moonlight . The men from the veranda came forward slowly . Two of the hooded figures lay in the grass ; two of the men from Carwellbent and removed their hoods . Both men were dead , strangers ; no one at Carwell had ever seen their faces before . In that first attack , no one at Carwell was hurt , but whatversmall elation the people might have felt at that disappeared as the glow of new fires showed in the sky . One after another , houses and barns became pyres , each signallingthe location of another man 's ruin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women and children huddled togetherand watched . The sun rose , and still the houses burned , sending twisting flags of grey smoke upward . The women cooked breakfast , and the people ate , but there was little talk and no laughter . Gideon 's only consoling thought was that by now Marcus had sent off the telegrams . P241Marcus had walked his horse down and taken a shortcut through the Carwell pastures , where in the old days the finebredsaddle horses were kept . That way , he avoided the new road and the swamp causeway entirely , coming out on the main pike . The little mare picked up a smooth and distanceeatingtrot ; she could keep that up for hours . The moonlit road was empty , on such a night as this , with the cool wind flowing past , a man could race to hell and back again . About eight miles from Carwell , at a time when he had pulled in his horse to rest her , Marcus heard the sound of many men riding . He dismounted , drawing the mare off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and stroking her soft nose . As they stood there , a group of mounted men came into view , about twenty in the white hoods of the Klan . Marcus waited until they were well out of sight and hearing ; then he mounted and rode on again . He was disturbed at first about the night riders . Obviously , they were bound for Carwell , and he wondered whether he should n't cut back , running the mare the way she was able to run , and warn the people . But then he reasonedthat twenty men would be hardly enough to raid the big house , that his father would be on the alert , and that if he turned back he stood a good chance of being cornered and shot down . With that in mind , he pushed his horse on , leaning forward in the saddle , half dozing sometimes with the rush of the wind and the quick , gliding trot of the mare . The road slipped by underneath , and the hours passed . Young enough to forget quickly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Marcus talked to the mare happily , " You wonderful horse , you sure enough beautiful little horse , you got a heart like a cannon blasting , you got a heart like a big sun rising  --  " As the night sky turned gray with dawn , Marcus pulled the horse in to a walk . A while farther on , he turned off the road into a little meadow . The mare was breathing hard ; they both needed rest . He was very tired now . Hitching the reins around his wrist , he lay down , only for a moment , only to catch his breath ; certainly he could n't really sleep here on the hard , damp ground . He closed his eyes for what seemed to be only a moment , and was awakened by the tugging of the reins . The hot sun was up now , and as he pushed himself up from the ground the mare came over and lowered her head for his caress . Glancing at his watch , he saw that it was past eight , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , and by a little after ten he rode into Columbia . People glanced at him curiously as he rode through the outer residential streets . There was an air about the town , a mood , a warning . He went straight to the Western Union office , hitched his horse onto the rail outside and entered . The nap had not refreshed him a great deal ; he was tired ; he wanted to get this job done , get out of town , find a shaded place in a piney grove somewhere , and sleep . The pimplefacedboy was not there now , just the operator , a sullen , dark man of forty . He stared at Marcus for a moment before he got up and came to the counter . " What do you want , boy ? " Marcus had the telegrams out in front of him . " Send all of these , please . " Just glancing at the sheets of paper , the operator said , " That 's a lot of money , boy . " Marcus took out five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's a hell of a lot of money for a nigger to have . " Gideon had told Marcus , " Send the telegrams , I trust you . " Now Marcus said , as ingratiatingly as he could , " I 'm sending them for Representative Jackson . He gave me the money . " " Did he ? " Marcus said , " Please , mister , I tell you he did . " The operator began to read through the telegrams . Then he looked keenly at Marcus , at his dusty , mud-streaked clothes , then past him at the mare . Marcus put his hand in his jacket pocket , closing his fingers around the Colt . The operator read some more of the telegrams . Then he picked the lot up and said : " All right , boy . I 'll send them . " He reached for the fifty dollars . " Send them now , while I 'm here , " Marcus said.  |p243An  edge came into the man 's voice . " Now look , boy  --  this sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like to have niggers tell me how to do my business . You get out of here and do n't worry about those telegrams . " " I paid you . Send them now , ' ' Marcus said . " Get out ! " Marcus drew the Colt and let it lie on the counter , the muzzle a few inches from the man 's stomach , his own body shielding the gun from anyone who might pass the shop or enter , his finger curled around the trigger . " Send them now , " Marcus said . " Just sit down at your key and start sending . " The operator paled a little . His lower lip began to twitch . He started to say , haltingly , " Boy , this is a hell of a  --  " " Start sending , " Marcus said . " Do n't try to make any trouble . I 'll know what you 're sending . " Keeping his eyes on Marcus , the operator walked over to his desk and sat down . He spread the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it click , " attention central attentioncentral Sumter street station columbia reporting niggerholdup in station wire railroad operator inform police attention  --  " The operator kept sending the signal , over and over . He pretended that he had finished the first telegram , crumpled it into a basket , started on the second . The pimply-faced boy entered the store . Marcus glanced at him , motioned with the revolver , " Get behind there , over against the wall . " The boy stood against the wall , mouth open , speechless . The opertor'skey clicked , " attention central i must keep sending  --  " He finished the third telegram and crumpled it into the basket . A middle aged business man entered the station . Marcusmotioned with the revolver and he took his place alongside the boy . The operator dropped the fourth telegram into the basket . The key clicked on . The fifth and sixth telegram followed . " That 's all , " the operator said hoarsely . " Stay where you are , " Marcus told them . He backed out . " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He backed through the door into the street , still holding the revolver ; then he heard the crack of a rifle , and together with the noise there was a smashing pain in his left arm , a red-hot hammer blow that left it hanging broken and useless . The pain was like nothing he had ever known ; somehow , he kept on his feet , but he dropped the revolver . He staggered over to the mare , unhitched her , and tried to crawl into the saddle . Two men with rifles were running down the street . One of them stopped to take aim . This time the searing brand was in Marcus ' thigh . Four more armed men darted around the oppositecorner . People were running from every direction . Marcus clawed onto the saddle . He got a leg over , telling the mare , " Run , baby , run . " He lay across the saddle , and the mare started down the street with her smooth , gliding trot . Now the armed men stopped and began to shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifle cracked , and the bullets ripped through Marcus . One caught the mare , and she stumbledand fell , pitching Marcus onto the earth . Neighing wildly , the mare gained her feet and raced off . The men approached Marcus slowly , still shooting , pausing every few steps to jam cartridges into their guns . Finally , they realized that he was dead . They walked close then , and one of them turned the boy over with his boot . After the first breakfast at the plantation house , Gideon took Benjamin Winthrope aside and said , " Do you feel that you still want to stay here ? They might let you go through . " " I 've been thinking of that all night , " Winthrope nodded . He was unshaven and haggard . " I 'll stay , if you want me to . I can help you , I think . " " Thank you . I hope to God you do n't regret it . " " I 've given it some consideration , " Winthrope said . " I try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you could take the children upstairs and organize some sort of lessons ? " Gideon said . " Brother Peter will help you . You know , it will be hard for them , cooped up here in the house all day . This sort of thing is terrible for children ; they ca n't understand why . If you could , in very simple terms of course , make them understand why we are here and what we are doing , it would be a fine thing . " " I 'll do my best , " Winthrope said .   " Do n't frighten them . Hold out hope to them . I think we have reason to hope . " Winthrope nodded and went to speak with Brother Peter . Most of the women were gathered in the dining room now . Gideon spoke to them , telling them simply and directly what their situation was . " This is nothing we could have avoided , " he said . " We must stand together . Trooper went his own way , and you know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , to rebuild together , to make something enduring and fine that will be worth the price we are paying . I am full of hope . We are in a good place here . We have food for many days , plenty of water , medicine , and a doctor . Mr. Winthrope has agreed to remain with us and teach the children . I think that is very important ; I think that lessons will go on and should go on , regardless of what happens . In a sense , we are a whole community here in this big house , and our great problem is whether we , the many families that we are , can live together for this time , however long or short , and solve the problems that arise . I think we can . In the past , we have met larger ones than face us now , and we have solved them together . We have here in the house more than two colored people for each white ; I do n't think that will be an obstacle . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . All that we have done has been based on the premise that in this state , where black and white live together , we must work together and build together . The men outside deny that fact . They have burned our houses to prove that they represent the right and justice . We have other ways to prove the justice of our contentions . We do not believe in terror , in murder , in destruction . We shall fight only in defenseof our lives and our lands , and we will set an example to this nation of an orderly and disciplined and freedomlovingpeople . " We made plans yesterday to go on working our land . For the time being , that is impossible . No one is to leave the house without permission . The men will have their tasks ; in addition to seeing that the cistern is kept full , that the stock is cared for , and that there is sufficient firewood , they                  @ @ @
