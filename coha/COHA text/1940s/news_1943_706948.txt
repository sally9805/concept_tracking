txt Edward J. Flynn resigned today as a Democratic National Committeeman from New York and this step apparently cleared the way for a close but favorable vote by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on his nomination to be Minister to Australia . The resignation was announced by Frank C. Walker , who succeeded Mr. Flynn as chairman of the national committee . The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will meet in executive session tomorrow morning to vote on recommending Mr. Flynn 's nomination . While most observers believed that he would win approval by a very slender margin , ' opponents were still hopeful that they could deadlock the committee by a tie vote in the absence of favorable proxy from Senator Glass of Virginia , who is ill at his Lynchburg home . Senate to Vote Monday The Senate itself will consider the nomination on Monday and a vigorous floor fight is expected . Mr. Flynn 's resignation of all party political positions assured him the vote of Senator Clark of Missouri , who had made this action the price of his support and who had told Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hatch of New Mexico would wage an intensive Campaign among Senate Democrats to block Mr. Flynn 's confirmation . Although Mr. Flynn had said when he quit as national chairman that he would retain his coin , mittee membership , administration Ileaders felt that they needed the support of Senators Clark and Hatch and persuaded the New Yorker to reconsider this decision , although it meant , in all probability , that the New York place on li the national committee would go to James A. Farley , who now is counted among the anti-New Dealers and an opponent of any effort to win a fourth term for the President . If Mr. Farley does n't take the job himself , he is expected to dictate the selection of Mr. Flynn 's successor by the New York Demo- , cratic Committee . " With full appreciation of his great services both as chairman and New York National Committeeman , I feel the exercise of his duties in the post to which the President has appointed him and the implied absence from the United States would complicate and make difficult adequate attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Walker said , in announcing his acceptance of Mr. Flynn 's resignation . " In this opinion Mr. Flynn joins . " So , in this severance of his relations to the national committee whigh he led for two years - with signal confidence and success , I wish to extend the thanks of the national Democratic organization and wish to him the finest future in his new activity . " Clark Is Satisfied When this statement was relayed to Senator Clark he told reporters that he would vote for Mr. Flynn , - " since he has resigned . " . Although he was unable to attend the Senate hearings on charges of unfitness leveled against the nominee , Senator Clark said that he had studied the 210 pages of printed testimony until 3 A. M. today , had concluded that Mr. Flynn had been " a- magnificent . witness " and that the testimony against him was " pitifuL "  - -  rd rather vote for Flynn than a Bingham or a Bullitt , " Senator Clark added . - His reference was to Robert W. Bingham ; former Ambassador to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ambassador to Russia and-France , who is now a special assistant to Secretary Knox . Attempts ' to poll the Senate committee in advance of today 's vote were unsatisfactory because they were incomplete . Some members could not be reached and others declined to reveal their intentions . Predictions- were heard freely that the vote Would be 11 to 10 for confirmation , but Senators making such forecasts assumed the absence of Senators Glass and Hiram Johnson of California and counted as anti-Flynn three Senators whose voting intentions have not been established publicly . These are Guy Gillette of Iowa , Walter George of Georgia and Robert M. LaFollette of Wisconsin . It was learned that Senator Vandenberg of Michigan has an anti-Flynn proxy from Senator Johnson and some of Mr. Flynn 's opponents predicted that this would cause . a tie , unless Senator Tom Connally of Texas , - chairman I of the committee , succeeds in getting a proxy from Senator Glass . The belief was expressed that Senator George would cast a reluctant vote for Mr. Flynn .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
