. . . the atrocities of war . . . the spectacle of Spaniards fighting among themselves ; and all the time , like the drone of a bagpipe accompanying the louder noises of what is officially called history , the enormous stupidity of average men and women , the chronic squalor of their superstitions , the bestiality of their occasional violences and orgies . . . Goya recorded it all . <P> Thus Aldous Huxley introduces The Complete Etchings of Goya ( Crown ; $3.50 ) , the first inclusive collection in book form . The new Goya reproduces , mostly in their original size , the 268 brutal , sometimes nether-worldly scenes which Francisco Jos de Goya y Lucientes ( 1746-1828 ) etched in the latter years of his life when deafness and ill health had embittered him and he was capping his prodigious career as court painter with a furious moral summation of all he had seen . Samples : a mule , Goya 's symbol of pride of lineage , fondling the genealogy of his mulish ancestors ; a rapist soldier dragging a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man vomiting on a tangled mass of war corpses ( " Is this what you were born for ? " ) . <P> Aldous Huxley ranks these works with other final achievements of great artists-Beethoven 's last quartets , the last poems of Yeats , the later paintings of El Greco . In the Goyas , Huxley sees a vision of " the unplumbed depths of original sin and original stupidity . . . . We are in a world of demons , witches and familiars . . . wholly disquieting inasmuch as it reveals the sort of thing that goes on in the squalid catacombs of the human mind . "
