To answer some of the questions our subscribers have been asking about how TIME gathers , verifies , writes and distributes its news . <P> War Correspondents ' uniforms were thicker than usual around TIME 'S offices last week . Army &; Navy Editor Perry Githens came back from 45 days on a baby flattop . Foreign News Editor Fill Calhoun returned from the Mediterranean theater where he went last August . Bill Chickering got back from the landings on Bougainville and Kwajalein . And Bureau Chief Bill Fisher came home from the Far East for the first time since 1933 . <P> Fisher started with TIME as head of our Manila office , but just three months before the Japs swarmed in to the Philippines we sent him off to start for TIME &; LIFE the first permanent news bureau ever opened in India . When he reached New Delhi he found only two other correspondents there-a lady who worked for the Manchester Guardian and an A.P . man who left a few months later . And the U.S. Army was represented by two officers , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a head start , Fisher not around and met most of India 's newsmakers months before other correspondents arrived on the scene ( there were forty in India by the following spring , and pretty soon our Army was all over the place ) . Fisher flew with the Air Service Command on one of its first surveys to plan the American airbases which now dot India , and at one time or another he has visited nearly all the provinces of British India and 14 of the native states ( at Udaipur the Maharajah put him up in a palace all his own with 16 servants in green livery ) . He has talked with Gandhi before his arrest in his mud hut at Wardha ( " he is Bernard Shaw one minute and St. Francis the next " ) - with Jawaharlal Nehru at the homes of friends in Delhi ( " the most truly simple man I have ever known " ) - with Moslem Leader Mohammed Ali Jinnah at his marble-lined villa in Bombay ( " an Indian George Arliss , complete with monocle " ) . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after leaving Yale , set out for the South Seas as a student ethnologist . For months he lived with Fatoia Tufele , king of a group of islands near Pago-Pago-and he still talks about the two beautiful damsels Fatoia provided to fan him as he sat dining on the hot porch of the king 's palace . After that he went to Fiji , Tonga . British Samoa and on to China , where he worked three years on the China Press and the Shanghai Times-did special pieces for Reuters , the New York Times , Asia , Travel and the Christian Science Monitor when he was n't too busy ducking Jap bombs . In 1936 he made a flying trip to Inner Mongolia , later traveled through Manchukuo and the guerrilla-infested country of Occupied China , visited Japan often-on one of those junkets covered the whole country from Nagasaki to Aomori . <P> Fisher 's trip home is just a part of TIME 'S unique system of writer-shuttling , under which our overseas correspondents are constantly coming back to New York to give TIME 'S writing the freshness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going overseas to get the firsthand feel of the news .
