If Britain was worried about where she could sell autos , she could find a red-hot market in the automaking but auto-hungry U.S. In a matter of hours last week , Manhattan 's Fergus Motors Inc. sold out its stock ( 30 ) of bantam-sized Standards . The price , awaiting OPA approval , will be between $1,500 and $1,800 . <P> Slightly bigger than the Crosley , Standards have a 90-inch wheelbase , a four-cylinder , eight-horsepower engine ( U.S. rating : 28 horsepower ) , will cruise at 50 m.p.h. , get 35 to 40 miles on a gallon of gas . The Standards come in three models , " tourer , " " saloon " ( sedan ) and " drophead coupe " ( convertible coupe ) . Another shipment of 8 or 9 cars arrived in the U.S. last week . <P> But Fergus Motors will not get rich on Standards . It must pay 300 ( $1,200 ) for the cars in England , a 10% import duty and a 7% federal tax , besides freight .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
