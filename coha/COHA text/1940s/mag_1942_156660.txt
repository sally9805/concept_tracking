An amazing new ten-day cure for stomach ulcers-which at one time or another afflict 15% of U.S. adults-has just been developed by two Northwestern University doctors . It employs Procter &; Gamble 's " Dreft , " which is technically not a soap but a " detergent " ( TIME , Jan. 5 ) that acts like soap . <P> In 1936 Dr. H. B. Bull found by chance that sodium lauryl sulfate ( main ingredient of " Dreft " ) denatures the molecules of egg albumen . He reasoned that it might also inactivate the powerful digestive juice , pepsin . Pepsin is a protein much like egg albumen . It causes ulcers by digesting the lining of nervous stomachs and duodenums * as well as food . " Dreft " worked . <P> Next Dr. S. J. Fogelson developed a method of prescribing " Dreft " in small , tasteless capsules to be taken after meals . The treatment works best , the doctor found , when the patient goes on the usual bland diet , but this is not necessary . Clinical results , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no recurrences , no bad effects .

The upset stomach hurries along incompletely digested food containing pepsin , against which the duodenum has no defense . Further along the intestine , bile from the protect liver it and from the alkaline pepsin. juices from the pancreas
