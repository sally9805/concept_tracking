A year ago Alla Nazimova decided Scriptwriter Arch Oboler was a genius , requested him to write a radio play for her . Pleased that Nazimova shared a conviction that he himself had held for years , Oboler turned out an opus called The Ivory Tower , in which , for the union minimum of $21 , Nazimova made her first appearance on the air . This week Oboler will present another famed actress in her radio debut . She is Elisabeth Bergner , who will run through Oboler 's latest radio work , An American is Born . <P> Not at all astonished is cocky little 31-year-old Oboler that such theatrical lights are anxious to deliver his lines . " They realize , " he points out , " I have a respect for the medium I am working in . " For this respectful attitude , Oboler is paid $4,000 a week by Procter &; Gamble . His contract gives him the last word on all problems connected with Everyman 's Theatre , on which each week he offers a half-hour of what he calls " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Out of his $4,000 , Oboler pays actors ( his top : $1,000 ) and musicians , sometimes spends as much as $3,600 to put a show across . One of these costlier numbers was This Lonely Heart , for which he hired a full symphony orchestra to weave in a bit of Tchaikovsky . Like Clifford Odets , his opposite number in the theatre , Oboler can not work without music , makes a point of listening to recordings of Beethoven , Moussorgsky , Sibelius and Debussy before settling into the creative groove . <P> Within the past couple of months Oboler has published a book of 14 radio plays , has been signed as a writer-director for the cinema by Frank Lloyd Productions . His virgin effort as a movie scriptwriter was Escape ( TIME , Nov. 18 ) , in which he managed to get Alla Nazimova a leading role . <P> In Hollywood Oboler was described as " all the Dead End Kids put together . " He badgered Escape 's Director Mervyn Le Roy endlessly about studio technique , until Le Roy finally told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a storm scene . As soon as Oboler had his eye glued to the finder , Le Roy cued technicians to drench him with cinema rain . <P> Reticent about discussing money , Oboler admits he is making twice as much as anybody should . He is having Frank Lloyd Wright design a $20,000 house for a 25-acre mountaintop he owns in the Santa Monica Mountains overlooking the Pacific . Feature of the place ( name : " Aeire " ) is a stream which according to present plans will run through the Oboler living room . On his mountaintop Oboler plans to do further experimental work for the radio . He realizes his responsibilities . " I have , " he says , " a larger audience now than Shakespeare ever had .
