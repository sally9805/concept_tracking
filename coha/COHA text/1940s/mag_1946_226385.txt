It was the last steeplechase race of the season at Pimlico . Six horses were entered-and the riders of all six had been fixed by a mysterious character identified only as " John . " One jockey took a stranglehold on his mount at the start and did n't let go until far too late . One rider just eased his horse up at the 15th jump , another managed to fall off his . In writing the script the night before , the big problem was devising a not too apparent way to make the favorite , Gala Reigh , lose . Jockey Francis Passmore got orders to set a murderous early pace and then collapse in the stretch . <P> Gala Reigh neglected to cooperate . He got off to a 15-length lead , and showed no signs of tiring . Jockey Passmore , getting worried , began jerking on the reins , swung the horse to right &; left . Said he later : " I think a blind man could have seen that I pulled the horse . " Gradually Mamie 's Lad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been bet , crept up , won in the last few strides . Willie Owen , the nation 's top steeplechase rider , up on Mamie 's Lad , said proudly : " I had to do everything I could to win . " <P> The six jockeys ( and two confederates ) had sold out for a paltry $4,660 between them . The long shot they had bet on at 10-to-1 had dropped to 8-5 by post time , largely as a result of their betting . Last week the Maryland Racing Commission , cracking down , ruled the eight off race tracks for life .
