' I do n't know German and I figured that might sound like ' Get up ! ' . . . The Jerry put down his gun and gave up . Then I looked across a field and there were six Jerries looking at us from a trench . ... I walked over shouting ' Oop mop ! ' and by golly , out they came . " <P> Later Joy and Cervo spotted more Germans in a hedge . " I shouted ' Oop mop ' and out came Jerries . . . . When we finished clearing up the hedge , we saw more and bigger foxholes , some of them with mortars . We made the Jerries bring out their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . The prisoners glared at us and I glared back and shouted ' Mop oop ! ' and we brought back our souvenirs . "
