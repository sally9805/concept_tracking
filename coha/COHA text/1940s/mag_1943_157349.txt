From a few neutral spots in Europe , Adolf Hitler is now waging an important offensive against the minds and will of his enemies . It is a campaign of propaganda and diplomacy , and its object is to avoid or at least postpone a two-front war in Europe . <P> In this campaign the Fhrer has three lines of action open to him . One , even to Hitler , must seem hopeless : an attempt to negotiate peace with Britain and the U.S. , thus averting an invasion of the Continent . Or he may try to come to terms with Russia-and the Germans , having grossly misjudged the Russians in 1941 , may well be capable of judging that they are now ripe for peace. * The third line of action is to divide the United Nations so seriously that a united strategy will be impossible . On this endeavor the Germans concentrated their chief and most successful efforts last week . <P> Neutral Bases . The Germans have chosen at least two neutral bases for their diplomatic offensive : Stockholm and Madrid . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Russians do not keep diplomats in Bern ) . The Nazis last week defined Franco 's Madrid as " the world 's most important mediation outpost today . " <P> In these posts , the Nazi Foreign Ministry has well-trusted men who had excellent prewar connections with Allied statesmen : Dr. Hans Thomsen , formerly Charg d'Affaires in Washington , in the Swedish capital and Hans Heinrich Dieckhoff in Spain . At the Vatican , another meeting ground for belligerent and neutral diplomats , Berlin has Baron Ernst von Weizacker , an old-line diplomat who was formerly Ribbentrop 's Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs . These efforts constitute probably the Fhrer 's last attempt to win the war by the semipeaceful means which served him well before the war . <P> Feelers to the East . Germany first extended a public peace feeler to Russia two months ago , when the Nazi-owned Dagsposten of Stockholm noted the futility of a stalemated Russian war , concluded that a Russo-German peace was not unthinkable , and hinted at developments next August . This suggestion left the Russians as silent and cold as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ der Schulenburg , once Ambassador to Moscow , made his second visit to Stockholm in recent weeks , there were rumors of a mort. concrete proposal : that Russia simply " lease " the rich Ukraine to the Germans , let them exploit its mines , fields , electric power , in peace . The Russians continued to kill Germans ( see p. 29 ) . <P> Such overtures were double-edged : they at once invited a solution of Germany 's difficulties in the east , and were capable of increasing suspicions between Russia and her Anglo-American Allies . <P> Feelers to the West . According to a report received and believed in Washington , German emissaries in Madrid tried to establish contact with U.S. Ambassador Carlton J. H. Hayes last week . They failed , and they were pointedly referred to President Roosevelt 's unconditional surrender statements .
