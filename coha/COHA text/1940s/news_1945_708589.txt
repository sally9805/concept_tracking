txt Mayor La Guardia 's control of budget-making by the Board of Estimate , unbroken for nearly twelve years , received a serious setback yesterday when Joseph D. , City Controller , frequently mentioned as a coalition candidate for Mayor , joined with the five Borough Presidents in adding $3,946,613 to the Mayor 's executive budget of $759,266,401 for 1945-46 and nullifying much of the Mayor 's veto power over jobs , salaries , vacancies and fund transfers in the offices of the borough heads . When the Board of Estimate adjourned until 2:20 P. M. today it had voted for a 1945-46 budget of $763,213,014 which included an increase of $3,050,000 over the sum allowed by the Mayor for cost-ofliving bonuses for teachers and other employes of the Board of Education and a rise of $230,000 over the Mayor 's bonus allowances for similar purposes in the Board of Higher Education . There was also a vote for a $50,000 rise in pay schedules in the office of John Cashmore , Borough President of Brooklyn , and one for an increase of $90,000 in city payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queens and the Bronx . Morris Tries to Hold Line The vote for the increased budget allowances and the curtailment of the Mayor 's veto powers through amendment of " terms and conditions of the budget " was 10 to 6 , with Deputy Mayor Rufus E. and Council President Newbold Morris trying to hold the line for the Mayor . The vote on the budget as amended was 10 to 3 , with Mr. voting in the negative and Mr. Morris not voting , on the ground that he could not vote for a budget that was " a kick at the integrity of the Executive " and a blow to sound fiscal administration . The adjournment was taken , on motion of James J. Lyons , Borough President of the Bronx , who was fearful that adoption might require at least twelve votes the first time on the calendar . The board must adopt a budget by midnight tonight to prevent the Mayor 's original executive budget from becoming effective through nonaction . Mr. 's three votes were the decisive factors in putting over every resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sided with them the proposals would have been defeated 9 to 7 . After the resolutions were adopted several of the Borough Presidents congratulated Mr. on his stand . Mr. declined to comment on his votes on the various proposals . The position to be taken by Mr. and the Borough Presidents presumably was known in advance to Mayor La Guardia , as the result of an executive meeting Df the Board of Estimate last meek . The Mayor followed his usual custom of remaining away From board meetings , however , and left it to Deputy Mayor Mc3ahen to express his views . The Uayor left City Hall before the budget meeting ended and was not available for comment . It was the consensus that the inn.eased budget would be adopted today without further change . Mr. 's stand with the Borough Presidents was regarded by some as confirmation of his re ? orted determination not to be // come a candidate for re-election on a La Guardia-headed ticket .

Heretofore the Controller had voted consistently with Mr. and Mr. Morris in support of the Mayor 's policy in this matter . Mr. 's break with the Mayor , with all its implication that he would welcome coalition support as a candidate for the city 's highest office , became evident at the start of the two-hour session on the budget and reached its climax when " on behalf of myself and the five Borough Presidents " he offered the resolution increasing the Mayor 's bonus of $240 a year for teachers paid up to $5,000 to one of $350 for teachers receiving up to $10,000 annually . Tax Cut May Shrink The budget for which Mr. and the five Borough Presidents cast their total of ten votes amounts to $763,213,014 , compared with the Mayor 's proposed $759,266,401 . It involves a tax fund levy of $755,410,334 , against that of $751,527,715 fixed in the Mayor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upward his estimate of general fund revenues  --  and he said that he had no such intention at present  --  the cut of 8 points in the basic real estate tax rate , predicted by the Mayor in his budget message  --  will be whittled down by two or perhaps three points to make the rate $2.68 or $2.69 . After a unanimous vote approving a long schedule of minor changes in the Mayor 's budget , the coalition with the Borough Presidents began to function in earnest . With Mr. expressing opposition by the Mayor it took the following steps : Adopted a resolution exempting the Borough Presidents from the requirement of a certificate from the Budget Director to fill personal service vacancies , except those of elected officials , existing on July 1 or occurring during the fiscal year starting on that date . Adopted a resolution setting aside the requirement that " any increase in salary , by modification or otherwise , of any employe getting $5,000 per annum or more must have the separate approval of the Mayor . " Adopted a resolution under which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on request of borough heads for transfer of funds within other than personal service codes ; and under which such transfers will become effective on three days ' notice to the controller and budget director , if no such action is taken . On all of these resolutions Mr. voted with the Borough Presidents , despite earnest pleas by Mr. that the result would be a serious blow to sound fiscal administration . The ten-vote bloc went on to approve a $50,000 increase in personal service items in Mr. Cashmore 's office and to restore to the budget the $90,000 appropriation denied by the Mayor to the SPCC child shelters . The changes voted in the " terms and conditions of the budget " were construed generally as having broad political significance because of their potential result of enlarging the patronage powers of the Borough Presidents . These powers have been cramped by the restrictions now voted down . The Mayor often has taken advantage of these restrictions to whip Borough Presidents into line with his general fiscal policy toward jobs , salaries and vacancies . The resolutions increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eligibility ceiling from $5,000 to $10,000 was introduced by Mr. after Mr. Lyons had been recognized by Mr. Morris and tried to sponsor a similar proposal . " By the Controller and the five Borough Presidents , " was Mr. Morris ' tart observation on the resolution . Mr. , unperturbed , accepted the challenge . " On behalf of myself and the five Borough Presidents , " he said , " I introduce the following resolution : " For teachers and other employes of the Board of Education the resolution proposed a total bonus allocation of $10,150,000 , compared with the $6,470,000 proposed by the Mayor . The proposal for teachers in the Board of Higher Education was an allocation of $480,000 , against $250,000 allowed in the Mayor 's executive budget . Backs Mayor on WNYC However , Mr. went along with the rest of the " big three " in voting down a proposal to eliminate the Mayor 's appro-. priation for WNYC , the municipal radio station . He took a similar stand in helping to defeat two proposals for additional changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Morris , helpless against the ten-vote combination headed by Mr. , put up their most vigorous fight against the proposal to increase the bonuses for teachers , which accounted for virtually all of the $3,946,613 increase over the Mayor 's budget total . It would increase the tax rate two or perhaps three points higher than the Mayor 's estimate of $2.66 , Mr. insisted . " This will throw the Mayor 's budget out of line , " he said . " The Mayor does n't believe that employes of the Board of Education and Higher Education really need this additional bonus as much as the taxpayers need relief from the terrible and heavy burden of local , Federal and State taxation . These employes are in better shape , so far as compensation is concerned , than city employes generally . If you do n't believe it , just look at their salary ranges . The Mayor went as far as he thought he should , and he believes it most unwise to go any farther . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
