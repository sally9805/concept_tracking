Dear Sirs : May I be permitted some brief comments on Mr. La Piana 's reply to my article in your issue of December 11 ? The subject matter under discussion , I submit , is the actual extent of Socialist-Catholic cooperation in Western Europe rather than the compatibility of rival metaphysics . I did not inquire whether the formation of a " Rome-London axis " would be a good thing . I stated that its existence is a fact . I did not question whether it is possible for Socialist and Catholic parties to cooperate . I pointed out that they are doing so . ( I might have added that leading Catholics are active members of the British Labor Party and that this party  --  which also has a Marxist wing and whose program is undoubtedly Socialist  --  is sup ported at the polls by the majority of Catholic voters in Britain , many of them Irish . ) If I am told that such cooperation is excluded by the very nature of papal and Catholic doctrine , I can only repeat that practice seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course catch up . Until it does we must stay content with ideological makeshifts . Mr. La Piana , it seems to me , rests too much weight on doctrinal pronouncements . I do not question their relevance to matters of principle , and that is just why I suggested that the schools issue is one which can be disinfected only by a policy of mutual toleration  --  which , as it happens , is precisely the democratic attitude appropriate to a pluralistic society . I did not deny that there are totalitarian tendencies at work , but their strength and relevance are not to be measured by the totalitarian character of the doctrines in which they find expression . That is why I find Mr. La Piana 's appeal to the various papal pronouncements on the subject of liberalism and socialism unconvincing . He recalls that Pius XI condemned socialism in principle . Presumably this condemnation holds good equally in all parts of Europe and , indeed , the world . Why , then , do Socialists and Catholics cooperate peacefully in Belgium and Holland , while in Spain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would seem , is not to be found in a further exegesis of " Rerum Novarum " or the Communist Manifesto but in a study of the actual conditions which promote peaceful cooperation ( and conflict ) in one case , violent antagonism in the other . I do not find in Mr. La Piana 's article anything to suggest that he fully appreciates the importance of a functioning democracy or the impact of what Marxists call the bourgeois revolution and non-Marxists the Industrial Revolution upon the politics of a modern society . I am puzzled by Mr. La Piana 's suggestion that I included agrarian reform among the questions whose solution is to be held over in the interest of cooperation . It seems to me that I said the opposite . Incidentally , it is not merely a question of " agrarian reform " in the narrow sense but of the transformation of backward or semi-backward societies into modern countries . In order to make my point clearer I would add that the Spanish civil war was not promoted by the mutual incompatibility of Thomist and humanist ethics but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Spanish society to adapt in time to modern conditions . For this failure the Liberals , who diverted the Spanish reforming movement since the early nineteenth century into exclusively anticlerical channels , must accept some share of the blame . As Ramos Oliveira , a Socialist , has pointed out in his great work on modern Spain , the Spanish revolution under Liberal leadership never faced its real tasks , ruined the countryside by transferring communal properties to a new oligarchy , and failed to create the conditions necessary for the growth of a genuinely modern form of capitalism . Spain is paying heavily for these failures , as well as for the character of the Spanish church , but I can not see what all this has got to do with Leo XIII and Pius XI . Incidentally , I never suggested that the Vatican would take the lead in a movement to democratize the Catholic world , as Mr. La Piana seems to suppose , nor did I suggest that Socialists would accept junior partnership in an alliance dominated by reactionaries . If they are doing so in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the urgent need to avert the imminent danger of civil war . They can at least claim to have won a breathing-space for democracy . Italy has had an extremely narrow escape from the fate which overtook Spain or Greece , and putting the Catholic right temporarily in complete possession of power was a cheap price to pay for the avoidance of catastrophe . These facts may not loom large within the precincts of Harvard . They are very noticeable in Europe . G. L. ARNOLD London , December 13 A " Strange " Review Dear Sirs : Rolfe Humphries is a good and entertaining critic of poetry , but there was something very strange about his review of Peter Viereck 's " Terror and Decorum " in The Nation of November 13 ? a review consisting of one long , condescending paragraph of faultfinding , a bare list of what Humphries considered the poet 's youthful faults of manner . Such emphasis might be justifiable if Viereck 's merits were so well known that they could be taken for granted , or if he had no merits , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , actually , Viereck 's work is mature , distinctive , and exciting in a way that is well worth reporting , and especially to readers of The Nation , whose interest in poetry must extend to something more than manner . Viereck is able to give remarkable imaginative depth and coherence to exactly those problems of history and freedom and the nature of man with which The Nation itself is concerned , and yet to do this with unfailing lyric spontaneity and inventiveness . Humphries 's refusal to give even a hint of such qualities not only discourages readers of The Nation from reading a book many of them would enjoy , but it also raises certain questions about the proper emphasis of a Poetry Chronicle in a journal of this kind . ROBERT GORHAM DAVIS t Northampton , Mass. , November 19 A " Difference of Opinion " Dear Sirs , Limitations of space being what they are , The Nation 's Verse Chronicle must often consider more than one poet in a single article . In the review of which Mr. Davis complains , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in view of my opinion that the work of both Kenneth Fearing and A. The NATION M. Klein was ( a ) better written , ( b ) more interesting . Therefore , I do not agree with Mr. Davis 's verdict that there was something very strange about my review . I do not agree that Mr. Viereck 's work is " mature , distinctive , and exciting , " etc . Perhaps Mr. Viereck , as Mr. Davis claims on his behalf , " is able to give remarkable depth and coherence " to the problems which he treats , but that he has done so , in this volume , " with unfailing lyric spontaneity and inventiveness " I am inclined to deny . I am more than inclined ; I actually do deny it . I am interested in " certain questions " that are raised about the proper emphasis of a poetry chronicle in a journal of this kind  --  interested in the same way that old Bill Byron used to be when the more irascible ball players questioned his judgment of balls and strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opinion . " ROLFE HUMPHRIES New York , November 24 Fedora and Chaplet Dear Sirs : In his interesting Verse Chronicle in The Nation of November 13 Rolfe Humphries finds some of Kenneth Fearing 's poems " a little vieux jeu " and suggests that Poetry , where they were first printed , must be falling behind the times . Having thus dragged in the magazine by its eyebrows , he might in fairness have added that it has also published for years the other two poets he reviewed , and whom he praised highly , A. M. Klein and Peter Viereck . Mr. Humphries 's remark was a. pointless slam , typical of the momentary pique of a momentarily rejected poet , but surprising in a writer of secure reputation . Let me say , too , that if we were so far advanced as to consider Mr. Fearing old hat , how could we feel the charm of Mr. Humphries 's own circa 1920 fedora , held together with a Horatian chaplet ? GEORGE DILLON Editor , Poetry Chicago , November 22 " On Me It Looks Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenneth Fearing which appeared in Poetry was that they were invariably the weaker poems by that writer . And Mr. Dillon knows just as well as I do why this is so  --  economic determinism . Mr. Fearing 's better poems find prompt acceptance and publication in better-paying markets . The magazine is therefore a repository of last resort ; its up-to-dateness is specious now , as dlstinguished from what it was during Miss Monroe 's editorship ; it is a sort of house organ of mediocrity , featuring cute pictures of bards in arch poses , and the lowest common denominator of the current fashion in verbalizing . Nineteen twenty , I must protest , was a little before my time ; fedora , chaplet , so on me it looks good , what does It matter ? If Mr. Dillon would read the review , published last July in Poetry , of my latest book , he might learn something to his advantage . But from his remark that I " praised highly " the work of Peter Viereck , I am forced to conclude , regretfully , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ROLFE HUMPHRIES
