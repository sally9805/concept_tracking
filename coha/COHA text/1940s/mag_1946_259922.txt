Just a year after V-E day , the U.S. Army 's reputation in Europe-once as bright and shining as a liberator 's sword-had disintegrated into disrepute . Last week General Joseph McNarney , commander of all U.S. troops in the European Theater , finally cracked the whip of discipline on the Army of Occupation in Germany ( see below ) . But the situation which called for this action had been worsening for a long time . In the Christian Century , the Rev. Renwick C. Kennedy , an ex-Army chaplain now returned to his pastorate at Camden , Ala. after 20 months in Europe , told the U.S. some sad truths about the occupying U.S. soldier : <P> " Taking him by &; large , making all the allowances for him that you can , he is more than a little pathetic . . . . He is not very clear in his own mind about why he fought , nor about what his victory means . As a matter of fact , he is not much interested in such matters . . . . <P> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 1 ) to find a German woman and sleep with her ; 2 ) to buy or steal a bottle of cognac and get stinking drunk ; 3 ) to go home. * <P> " There he stands in his bulging clothes , fat , overfed , lonely , a bit wistful , seeing little , understanding less-the Conqueror , with a chocolate bar in one pocket and a package of cigarets in the other . . . . The chocolate bar and the cigarets are about all that he , the Conqueror , has to give the conquered . . . . <P> " The average American in Europe was not a bad guy . ... He fought bravely . He died by the thousands . ... He was generous to both Allied and enemy people . . . . Yet he was a failure as a propaganda agent for democracy , for the American way of life and for himself as an individual . . . . " <P> The Barbarians . " His attitude was superiority ... It is incredible how naive and stupid he often was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populations by the few harlots , drunks and black marketeers they met ; men from tenant farmer cabins in the South scoffing at the rock houses of European peasants . . . illiterates from Brooklyn , Texas and Los Angeles deriding the mellow folkways of ancient European communities . ... <P> " They did not learn much . . . they did not feel there was much to be learned ... It never occurred to them that many Englishmen , Frenchmen and Germans soon came to look upon them as uncouth barbarians . . . . <P> " The conduct of the average soldier ... was at the least noisy and boisterous . At the worst it was criminal . The average was odious and disgusting . <P> " The G.I .. ( and officer ) considered any young woman fair prey , and did not hesitate to make a pass at her . He chased women openly all over Europe , not merely professionals but any woman . ... It was also a heavy drinking army ... He drank not with discretion and good manners , but like a beast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing of all to Europeans was simply the gross bad manners of the Americans . Soldiers expressed their violent , ill-informed opinions of a people , a country , a city , in loud voices anywhere . . . . <P> " From England to Germany they have had enough of the Americans . It is not that they actually hate us . It is merely that they have had to put up with so much from us . ... We have been so loud , so boisterous , so crude and often so obnoxious that they will be glad to see the last American soldier leave . . . .
