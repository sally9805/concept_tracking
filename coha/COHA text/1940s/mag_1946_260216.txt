Victorians were appalled , but the Lawrence sisters saw their duty and did it . Nellie , Millie and Dollie Lawrence thought that young English ladies were too delicately nurtured ; what they needed was a more robust schooling-the kind Eton gave to boys . On a breeze-bathed seacoast near Brighton , in 1885 , the sisters built their new Roedean ( rhymes with so keen ) School . <P> In time the bouncy , bumpy Roedean Girl became a national byword , as British as roast beef and Yorkshire pudding , and the butt of music-hall skits . She wore a bright-colored , shapeless wool Mother Hubbard called a djibbah , * talked in a full-voiced , fruity accent . The Roedean Girl knew how to play cricket and to " play the game " ; she never " let the side down , " never " sneaked , " always " pulled her weight . " In caricature and often in fact , she was a mannish , muscular , back-slapping bluestocking . <P> By 1924 Nellie Lawrence was too old to high-dive from Brighton 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roedean to big-boned , red-cheeked Emmeline Tanner . Last week , at 70 , stately , awesome Miss Tanner was ready in her turn to retire . <P> Under Miss Tanner " the girls ' Eton " was more interested in career-mindedness than muscle . The headmistress thought that " every woman should earn her place in the world , and should be able to give back in some measure all the world gives her . " She encouraged Roedean girls to go on to a university ( one in eight does , a high average in England ) , was pleased that many of the present crop planned professional careers-in medicine , law , music , art . By current-events classes , Miss Tanner tried to make the 367 girls conscious of the world outside , not long ago held special prayers for U.N . ' s Trygve Lie ( father of Old Roedeanean Guri Lie ) . <P> Playing Fields . In Roedean 's cloistered life , the girls have few chances to meet outsiders , are apt to give an impression of embarrassed uppityness when they do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makeup and jewelry , allowing the girls little pocket money and decreeing a Spartan , uniformed existence . As in most girls ' schools in Britain , the girls wear identical Navy jumpers much of the time ; they get what individualism they can out of choosing the colors of their suppertime djibbahs . <P> Roedean last week braced itself for the advent of a new headmistress . In her forties , tweedy Norah Horobin is a " Christian Socialist " and a lady of the likes of the Lawrence sisters . Miss Horobin is strong on discipline , science and sports , and already the word has spread to Roedean that she is " frightfully gamesy . " <P> Alumnae are proud that World War II was partly won on the playing fields of Roedean , by Old Roedeaneans who became officers in the women 's services , radio operators , ambulance drivers . Roedean itself was evacuated to Keswick , in the Lake District , while the Royal Navy took over its dormitories . The story goes that sailors billeted there almost wore out the buzzer system when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistress in the night , ring the bell .
