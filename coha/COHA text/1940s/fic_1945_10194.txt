Ellery nodded , as if this explained everything . " Your father murdered your mother . " " Yes ! " " Here , let me refill your glass . " As Ellery busied himself with the ice and soda , he went on in a matter-of-fact way : " Of course , I 've looked over those newspaper clippings you enclosed in your letter , but they do n't tell much . This happened twelve years ago ? " " That 's right , Mr. Queen , " said Linda . Ellery warned her with a glance . " Go on , Captain , " he said encouragingly . " Tell me all about it . " I was ten years old Davy said in a listless voice , and Linda was nine . My father , Bayard Fox , is my Uncle Talbot 's brother . They were in business together in Wrightsville  --  Bayard &; Talbot Fox Company , Machinists ' Tools . The families lived next door to each other  --  Uncle Talbot and Aunt Emily and Linny in the house they still live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next house . It 's on Hill Drive . After the thing happened , Uncle Tal took me into his home , and my father 's and mother 's house was closed up  --  left just as it was , and locked . It 's still standing there , untouched  --  inside or out . Nobody'dever rent it or buy it . . . knowing . Wrightsville 's a little superstitious about those things . Ellery nodded , remembering the bright little house of Jim and Nora Haight years before . My father was arrested , tried , and found guilty . The case got everybody pretty excited . The papers played it up big and called my father " The Wrightsville Fox "  --  they sure ran him down ! He was sentenced to life imprisonment and was put away in State Penitentiary . That 's where he still is . The case against him was absolutely cold  --  not a shadow of doubt . From the facts , my father was the only one who could possibly have poisoned my mother . At least , that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess every kid does , deep down . But I loved my father , too , in a different sort of way . I suppose you could say he was my hero . Dad would take me on fishing trips , or we 'd go camping up in the Mahoganies week ends . Ile was always teachingme things  --  about the woods , about animal-life and bird-life , about trees and plants and mosses and insects . I do n't know where he 'd picked it all up , but I do remember he was a lonely sort of man , always a little sad . He 'd get a quiet kick out of our trips together , just the two of us ; and of course it was great stuff to me . We did n't do it often , because Mother was n't well and could n't be left alone too much . The only thing that made our trips possible at all was that Uncle Tal and Aunt Emily lived right next door , and they always saw to it Mother was well taken care of while we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotch-and-soda , staring into the Queen fireplace . I was only ten , as I say , and when they told me my father had killed my mother I fought and snarled like a treed cat . I did n't believe it . I could n't . Not my father . But then , after the trial  --  I was n't allowed to go , and I did n't know what it was all about , naturally  --  after Aunt Emily and Uncle Tal talked to me  --  why , I wanted to die myself . I was all mixed up inside . I did n't believe in anything or anybody after that . I guess it was the kind of shock no ten-year-old could stand up under without having it screw him all up . Ellery nodded . One of the things that happened to me was that I did n't want to see my father . I just could n't . I tried to forget he 'd ever been my father , or that anybody named Bayard Fox was related to me at all . And as for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guardian and giving me his entire estate , which included his share of the plant , in trust with my uncle , till I came of age . Just as if he 'd died . I guess he figured that where he was , he might just as well be dead . Davy smiled that sweet smile , and Linda shut her eyes . For a long time after the murder of my mother  --  her name was Jessica , Mr. Queen  --  I could n't think of anything but that my father was a murderer and I was his son . I got a queer notion in my head that it was like having blue eyes and black hair and lots of freckles  --  if your father had them , the chances were you 'd have them , too . It 's a fact I take after Dad physically ; Uncle Tal says I look just like him when he was my age , though I 'm bigger and more solidly built ... . So gradually I came to have a whopping big fear . I " A fear ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to be a murderer , too . Linda took Davy 's hand , and Ellery glanced from Davy to Linda and back again . " Go on , " he said . I wo n't go into my adolescence . It was plenty grim . I could n't get away from the name Fox or my " past "  --  the kids of Wrightsvillesaw to that , and their parents were n't much kinder , though the grown people snickered it behind their hands where the kids screamed it at me . But I guess I was a stubborn cuss , and I stuck it out . It meant daily fist-fights , but they were n't going to make me run away . So I grew up cocky , bitter , suspicious , and on the defensive , all the time in secret battling that childhood fear I 'd developed of being  --  you might say  --  " diseased , " of carrying the germs of murder in me , inherited from my murderer-father . ' Does n't make much sense , Mr. Queen , does it ? " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellery . For a time , just before the War , I thought I had its number . That was when Lin and I decided we were in love and had always been . And when on my last furlough before shipping out we decided to get married , and told the folks  --  my uncle and aunt , Linny 's foster-parents  --  and Uncle Tal was dead-set against it , I was plenty steamed . But Uncle Tal practically predicted what would happen . And Aunt Emily was afraid of the past , too . They knew me better than I knew myself , as it turned out . Or maybe it was a sort of family instinct . I do n't know . Anyway , Linny and I had to put the pressure on before they 'd say okay . I found out how right they were , Mr. Queen . . . in China , fighting Japs . And when Lew Binks and I crashed , and I spentp53that seven weeks in the mountains , hiding from Jap patrols and foraging for food and lugging Binks  --  his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we wound up with our backs to the wall  --  a big rock wall , thank God -- and they began to run into my tommy-gun fire . . . I guess what 1 'd been through , the blood bath at the end , seeing the Japs go down like toys under my fire  --  all that pushed me off the deep end . All through the rest  --  the hospitals in China and India , Binks 's death , the flight back to the States  --  I could think of only one thing : killing . Killing from a P-38 , seeing my wing guns pepper Jap crates  --  when I could catch ' em  --  seeing the oily smoke and the death dive  --  killing from that rocky ledge with a sub-machine gun , killing with ammunitionfrom my .45 and Binks 's  --  killing , killing , killing , the way you sometimes kill in dreams . There 's never any end to it . You just kill and kill  --  nothing can stop you , and everything goes down in front of you . And I was absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all  --  I had my father 's blood in me , all right . I was a born killer . When I got home I was still thinking of myself that way  --  a sort of vague thing  --  a " born killer "  --  a killer in general terms - not killing individuals , but just . . . just killing , Mr. Queen  --  I ca n't explain it any other way . Ellery nodded . But after I 'd been home a while , I found myself thinking of killing in specific terms . Of killing ... Linny . Now Davy was on his feet and Linda was crying inaudibly on the Queen hearth-rug . I fought it night after night . But I knew sooner or later I 'd lose . I knew I 'd do it ! I told you , Mr. Queen , it does n't make sense . God knows I love my Linny ; she 's everything in the world to me  --  there is n't anything or anyone else . That 's the way it 's always been ; it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anything she 's done , or has n't done . Oh , there was that business about Alvin Cain ; lie 's chased Linny since she was in high school , and somebody sent me some nasty gossip while I was in China , and I 've dreamed about him a lot  --  not very sweet dreams . But I know Lin loves me  --  1 know she 's incapable of cheating  --  and even if she wanted to cheat , I know she 'd never pick a specimen like Cain ; she has too good taste . No , it 's not Linda  --  I 'd let myself be taken alive by Japs before I 'd touch a hair of her head . . . I mean , in my right self . And still , I could n't stop myself . I knew something inside me  --  rotten , murderous , strong as the devil in bell  --  would break out one night and make me kill my wife . . . the way it made my father kill his . And the other night , it actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was some other man . I was off on one side , watching him and being sick over what he was trying to do . But I could n't stop him . You 'll have to believe that , Mr. Queen . I just could n't . Davy shuffled over to the window and looked down at West Eighty-seventh Street . The hand on the window shook . " Mr. Queen , you 've got to help us , " sobbed Linda . " You 've got to ! It means Davy 's sanity . It means the rest of our life together . It means the children we were going to have  --  " " It means , " said Davy in a dry way , without turning , " Linda 's life . Let 's face it . " Ellery knocked his pipe against the cold andiron . " I think , " he said amiably , " we can discount your obsession in China , Captain , that you were a born killer . ' That was the natural climax of eleven years or so of psychological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were brooding about being your father 's son . " The important thing is the crystallization of that obsession when you got home . The fear that you 're like your father specifically in relation to the wife ' concept was buried deep in your unconscious , and it was jarred to the surface under stimulus of your war experiences . I 'm only guessing , but probably a psychiatrist would say that your father fixation , and your hatred for your mother , caused you to transfer that hatred to Linda . . . that is , that Linda is notp55the true object of your murder fantasy , but your mother , whom Linda represents . " " My mother ! " gasped Davy , blundering about ; and over Linda 's tearstained face came a great gladness . " At any rate , " Ellery continued , " such things arc far outside my province . Much as I 'm inclined to help you , Captain Fox , now that I 've heard your story  --  and to help you , Linda ; that goes without saying  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed , as you told me in your letter . " Linda sprang to her feet . " Mr. Queen , there is a way . I 'm sure of it , in the light of what you just said . There 's a way you can help us ! " Ellery regarded her keenly . " There is , Linda ? How ? " " Investigate the case ! " " Case ? Which case ? " " The case of Davy 's father and mother ! " " I 'm afraid I do n't quite see  --  " " You can prove Davy 's father was innocent , Mr. Queen , " said Linda eagerly . " Because if Bayard Fox did n't murder Jessica Fox , then Bayard Fox is n't a murderer , and Davy is n't the son of a murderer . And then all this horrible nonsense about being a born killer ' and having his father 's blood ' in him and all that  --  it would go up like smoke , Mr. Queen ! Do n't you see ? Proving Davy 's father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than all the doctors in the world ! " Ellery stared at her . " My dear Linda , " he said at last , " only a woman deeply in love would think of such a clever  --  really a brilliant  --  solution . But  --  " he shook his head  --  " the clippings you sent about the trial , Davy 's own story just now , invalidate your whole premise . How could I  --  or anyone  --  prove Bayard Fox innocent when the evidence against him conclusively showed that he was guilty ? Unless  --  " and his eyes narrowed  --  " you have reason to believe he was innocent . Have you , Linda ? " Linda 's radiance dimmed a little . " Well ... Tell Mr. Queen , Davy . "  | Davy came back from the window to pick up his empty glass and finger it . " I have nothing but my father 's word . " " I see . Sit down . Sit down , both of you . " They seated themselves on the sofa , looking up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be explicit . Exactly what was Bayard Fox 's attitude at the time of his trial ? " " Daddy Tal and Mother Emily , " said Linda , " used to talk about it when they thought I could n't overhear . They used to say how funny it was that Bayard kept insisting all through the trial that he had n't done it . " " That 's a common phenomenon , " said Ellery with a trace of impatience . " Has he persisted in his denials ? " Davy shrugged . " For about two years after he was sent up , Dad bombarded the family and his lawyer with appeals , saying he was n't guilty , and so on  --  that they 'd let an innocent man be sent to jail . He put up a stiff battle . But everything was done for him legally that could have been ; and after a while he just gave up , I guess . Anyway , he stopped appealing to people . " After Linny and I were married  --  it was on my way back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Penitentiary to see him . I guess I had a feeling I ought to , before I shipped over . You know how it is at a time like that . " It 's the only time I 've seen Dad since they took him away , when I was ten . " It was pretty rugged , Mr. Queen . Dad 's only fifty-two , but  --  well , he looked seventy when I saw him . " Davy bit his lip , scowling . " He seemed glad I 'd come . We did n't have much to say to each other . We just sat there . I hardly recognized him and he  --  well , I suppose he would n't have known me at all if I had n't announced who wanted to see him . We just sat looking at each other when we thought the other was n't . " Just before I had to leave , he took my hand all of a sudden and said to me : Davy , you think I killed your mother , do n't you ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mumbled something stupid  --  I do n't remember what . Dad gave me the funniest look . It was n't sore , or bitter , or resentful . Just . . . I do n't know .. .  |p57ho|peless  . He shook his head and said to me : I ca n't understand it , Davy . Because I did n't kill her . 1 ca n't have my own son thinking I killed his mother , when I did n't . ' And that 's all he said . We shook hands and he  --  he kissed me and I went on back to camp . I was plenty confused . But then I said to myself : What else could he say to his son ? ' But that 's what he said , Mr. Queen . It is n't much . I told Linny it did n't mean anything . " Ellery sat down in the hollowed seat of the armchair opposite them , sucking at his empty pipe . After a while he said : " Davy , suppose I agree to investigate your father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legally settled fact that he murdered your mother twelve years ago  --  which , after all , is the greatest likelihood . What would you do then ? " " Leave Linny , " cried Davy Fox . " We 'll get a divorce . I 'll never see her again . I wo n't gamble with Lin 's life  --  I 'll take off first ! " " And you , Linda ? " Linda sent him the misshapen gnome of a smile . " You heard my husband , Mr. Queen . He 's a very stubborn guy . It 's only on that basis that he 'd even consider coming with me to New York to see you . " She paused . And then she said : " Please ? " " It 's a million-to-one shot , you know , " said Ellery . Linda cried : " I want my husband ! " And Davy said miserably : " Lin . Baby  --  " But she began to weep again , into her hands , and Davy stopped , his shoulders sagging . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two still occupying the same bedroom ? " " Good grief , no ! " shouted Davy . " Good . " Ellery rose briskly . " Go back to Wrightsville , both of you . I 'll join you there in a few days . " " You 're taking the case ! " Linda jumped up from the sofa . Ellery took her hand . " I like million-to-one shots , " he smiled . " Especially when there 's nothing much to go on but a man 's word , and faith in two pretty wonderful kids . "  | When Davy and Linda had gone , Ellery shaved , whistling thoughtfully all the while , took his hat , and went downtown to Police Headquarters . " Dad , " he said , strolling into Inspector Queen 's office , " what are my chances of getting custody of a lifer ? " " Aha , " said Sergeant Velie , looking as if he smelled something . " Guinea pigs again . " " Shut up , Velie , " said the Inspector . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That 's what I thought , " said Ellery , seating himself comfortably in the leather chair and putting his feet up on his father 's desk . " So you 'll have to do it for me . " " All right , all right , " said the old man irritably , " and watchthat varnish , please . What lifer , and what 's he in where for ? " " Bayard Fox of Wrightsville . Murder . He 's at the State Pen . " " What the blue jinkers would you be wanting with him ? Say ! Wrightsville ? " " The Haight case , " said Sergeant Velie with excitement . " Was there a guy named Fox mixed up in that one , Maestro ? " " No , no , Sergeant , no connection . Want with him , Dad ? Why , I want him to take a trip back to his home town with me . " The Inspector stared . " Come on , " he grunted finally . " Loosen up , Ellery . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellery gave his father details . " Sir Galawhoozis on a white horse , " said Sergeant Velie , shaking his ponderous head . " Well , I 'll try , " said the Inspector without enthusiasm . He picked up one of his telephones . " Charlie . Get me the D.A . of Wright County . . . Probably at the County Courthouse in Wrightsville , you dimwit . . . Yes , I 'll wait . " " Too bad Carter Bradford is n't Prosecutor up there any longer , " moaned Ellery . " I 'd get custody of Bayard Fox in a shot . But Cart had to go and get himself elected to the State Senate . " " What 's his name , Charlie ? " demanded the Inspector . " Oh . Okay . Put him through . . . . Hello ! Mr. Hendrix ? Inspector Queen of N.Y.C. police headquarters . Say , can I borrow a liferp59who s at State Pen ? . . . Bayard Fox of Wrightsville . I want temporarycustody . Say for a couple of weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prosecutor . " And what the devil do you want him for , Inspector Queen ? " " Reinvestigation of the Jessica lux murder case , Mr. Hendrix , " said the Inspector briskly . " In Wrightsville , where it happened . " " Why , good Lord , Inspector , the woman 's been dead and buried for twelve years and Fox has n't had his nose out since . Reinvestigation ? " Prosecutor Hendrix seemed worried . " It 's darned irregular . Is New York interested ? " " You might say so , " replied the Inspector , winking at his son . " New evidence , eh ? " " Well . . . yes and no , Mr. Hendrix , " said the Inspector , beginning to perspire . " It 's not exactly new ' evidence . It 's  --  a something . That 's it . A something , ha-ha . " " Hmm , " said Hendrix , sounding not amused . " It 's darned irregular , Inspector Queen , without new evidence  --  " " Now see here , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he usually reserved for the Commissioner . " This is n't a frivolous business , I give you my word . And there 's no politics mixed up in it . It 's a pure matter of justice  --  " " He got justice . " " Maybe he did n't . I mean . . . The point is , technically , you do n't ever have to let Fox out of your clutches , Mr. Prosecutor . Why , you can send a detective from your own office up to the Pen and he can take Fox into custody on your order , or a court order , or however you choose to work it . See ? My deputy will meet your detective up there , and they can all go over to Wrightsvilletogether . Get it ? " And the old gentleman beamed at the telephone , won over by his own beautiful picture . " But without new evidence , " began the Prosecutor . Then he stopped . Then he said : " Your deputy ? Who is your deputy , In-spector ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got my name . Well , well , let 's put all our cards on the table . He 's my son , ha-ha ! Ellery Queen . "  | " Oh , " said Hendrix , and the receiver was ominously dumb . " I 've heard of him , " he said at last . " Came up here a few years back and played Kelly pool with the Haight case . When Senator Bradford was Prosecutor . So Ellery Queen wants to come up to Wrightsville again , does he ? " " That 's it , Mr. Hendrix . " Inspector Queen shrugged violently in the direction of his son . " Well , Inspector , let me sleep on it  --  " " Now listen , Hendrix , do n't give me any of your fancy upstate brush-offs , " snapped the Inspector , assuming his " tough " voice . " You can wangle it , and you know blasted well you can ! A thing like this is pretty much discretionary , and if you 're going to let personal considerations  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Inspector . I 've never even met your son  --  " " Okay . Then what 's to prevent ? Ellery 's not going to step on anybody 's corns . Ask Judge Eli Martin  --  old Martin 'd give you a court order like that , Mr. Hendrix ! Dress it up to suit yourself  --  use my name , if you want  --  why , with your man having actual physical custody of Bayard Fox , what harm can there be ? He can sleep with Fox in the same bed for all we care ! " There was a great deal more of the same , and when Inspector Queen hung up he was mopping his head . " Why , why , why I let you finagle me into doing your dirty work , my son , " he snarled , " I 'll never know ! Okay . It 's all set , Your Majesty . " Ellery said absently : " Thanks , Dad . Now all I have to do is prove Fox innocent when he 's probably as guilty as Cain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sir Galawhoozis , " he said.  |p61THE  WARDEN WAS a gentle-shouldered little man who looked more like a pedant than a practising penologist . " I 'm rather glad you 're looking into this , Mr. Queen , " he said uneasily . " There 's something about Fox . . . He 's a quiet one . Been a model prisoner . Pleasant , co-operative , but . . . untouchable , if you know what I mean . " " Untouchable ? " Ellery raised his brows . " I 'm afraid I do n't , Warden , quite . " The Warden shrugged . " I 've handled lots of prisoners in my time , Mr. Queen . This man is in a class by himself . At first he wanted help  --  from anyone  --  other inmates , guards , me . Very vocal . Sure he was railroaded , and that sort of thing . Like all the rest . . . But then something happened to him . He tightened up . Built a shell around himself . And that 's where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is inside . Deep , Fox is  --  deep . " He 'll be a few moments yet , Mr. Queen . Meanwhile , there 's someone waiting for you in my office . " The Warden held open his office door , and Ellery perceived Chief Dakin of Wrightsville within , smiling at him . " Dakin ! " " Hullo again , Mr. Queen . " They shook hands with pleasure . Chief Dakin was an elongated countryman with transparent eyes and a large Yankee nose who would have looked perfectly at home behind a plow . But his mouth was almost tender , and there was an air about him  --  of dependability , gravity , and intelligence  --  that lifted him out of a type . He was baritone soloist of the First Congregationalist choir in High Village , a tolerant teetotaler , and the best poker player in Wright County . He had been Wrightsville 's Chief of Police for over twenty years . " But why are you here , Chief ? " demanded Ellery . " I thought I was to meet one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detective Howie  --  Mr. Ellery Queen . " The man was sitting so still in his corner that he had seemed part of the Warden 's office furnishings . Howie was a great fat fellow in a wrinkled blue gabardine suit greasy with age and streaked with old cigaret ash . A once-white handkerchief was stuffed between his wilted collar and his mottled neck ; and his puffy brick-colored paws clutched a bundle of blue-backed papers bound with a red rubber-band . He merely nodded at Ellery ; he neither rose nor offered his hand . " I 'm happy to make your acquaintance , Howie , " said Ellery pleasantly . " We 'll be seeing a good deal of each other in the next couple of weeks , so  --  " " I got my orders , " said Detective Howie in a screeky voice . And his fat lips snapped shut . That was that . It began to look difficult . " Howie 's a great one for orders , " explained Chief Dakin dryly . " I guess that 's how Phil Hendrix come to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also one of the reasons I drove up . I did n't want you thinkin ' everybody in Wrightsville had orders : " " Thanks , " Ellery grinned . Then he said to Detective Howie : " And just what are your orders , Mr. Howie ? " " No funny business . " The mouth snapped shut again . " Right , " said Ellery cheerfully . " Now we understand each other . ... One of the reasons you drove up , Dakin ? " Dakin chuckled . " Ai n't much bamboozles you , is there ? The other reason is I 'm sworn to preserve the peace of Wrightsville . " " Oh , " said Ellery . " Expecting trouble , Chief ? " asked the Warden anxiously . " Maybe , Warden . " " But why ? " Ellery asked . " I guess it 's because Wrightsville was once pretty riled aboutp63Bayard Fox , Mr. Queen . Came close to actin ' mighty foolish , the town did . We had quite a time of it . " Ellery nodded soberly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light eyes on Ellery , " we 'd sort of smuggle him into town by auto through the servants ' entrance . They 'll be watchin ' the trains . " " After twelve years ? " " I 'm not sayin ' anything 's goin ' to happen , Mr. Queen . " " Dakin , do you think Bayard Fox poisoned his wife ? " The Chief seemed startled . " Why , sure . It was absolutely open and shut . Not a loophole a louse could wriggle through , Mr. Queen . I 'm mighty glad to see you , but you 're wastin ' your time . " Ellery glanced at the fat man in the corner . " And you , Howie ? Do you think Fox was guilty ? " Detective Howie spat accurately halfway across the room into the Warden 's spittoon . " Are you kiddin ' ? " he said . Ellery thought of Linda Fox 's tormented face , the shaking hands of Captain Davy Fox . " All right , Warden , " he said with a smile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The man who came into the Warden 's office so very correctly was stooped-over and squeezed-looking , as if Time had had him in its vise for more than his span . A brown and freckled scalp glistened through his thin white hair ; apparently he did much outdoors work at the prison . He was dressed respectably in a blue serge suit and black shoes , and he wore a white shirt and a neat pin-stripe blue tie . Ellery noticed a smile of satisfaction on the Warden 's lips , such as mothers smile when they have dressed their young especially well . " They fixed you up fine for clothes , I see , " said the Warden . " Yes , Warden . " Bayard Fox folded his hands before him , looking down at the floor . But Ellery detected a glitter in his eyes , quickly concealed . " Thank you , Warden . "  | " Hullo , Mr. Fox , " boomed Chief Dakin . Ellery could not decide whether it was the familiar voice or Dakin 's use of the word " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so swiftly , and the glow to stain the weathered cheeks . " Chief ! " Bayard Fox took a half-step forward . But then he halted and looked down again . " I hardly recognized you , Mr. Dakin . " " How are you ? " " Fine , thank you , Mr. Dakin . " " You 're lookin ' fit . " " The Warden is kind to me . " There was no self-pity in those mumbly accents ; merely gratitude . A broken man , thought Ellery , the spirit all but shattered . Or  --  and he caught himself up  --  or so Fox seemed . " And this is Mr. Ellery Queen , Fox , " said the Warden . " He 's the one responsible for this trip back to Wrightsville . " " How do you do , sir ? " Eyes down , but the glitter again . " You 'll technically be in custody of Detective Howie here , of Prosecutor Hendrix 's office . " " Yes , Warden . " Detective Howie rose from his mooring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Fox , " and waited . Bayard Fox 's glance came up not so much against his will , it seemed to Ellery , as in the absence of it . And when Ellery looked into those encaverned eyes  --  Davy 's eyes , but old , old , embalmed  --  he felt a pang of pity and knew why the Warden , a sensitive man , had spoken of remoteness . On the surface it appeared that even now , with hope held out to him  --  such as it was  --  Bayard Fox had no hope . And yet . . . that glitter . A little shutter-flash . A flash of something that was more life than death . Ellery frowned : " You know why we 're going back to Wrights-ville ? " " The Warden told me , sir . " " Please call me anything but sir . ' And I 'll call you Bayard , if I may . We must be friends , or we ca n't work at this at all .

" " My boy 's one of the big heroes of the War , Warden , " said Bayard Fox with a slightly animated smile . " I 've been reading about  --  " He stopped . Then he said stolidly : " I do n't want to spoil my son 's life , Mr. Queen . This ca n't do any good . " " You mean you do n't want your case reopened ? " " Mr. Queen , this ca n't do any good . " Sincerity or cunning ? Detective Howie spat into the spittoon . Eatery said abruptly : " Bayard , I do n't know whether it will do any good or not . I do n't know , from my own knowledge , whether you 're guilty or innocent . But I 'll tell you this : Your son 's happiness  --  perhaps a great deal more  --  hangs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must have your unquestioning co-operation . Will you trust me  --  and do exactly as I ask you to ? " That sunken glance went to the Warden , as if  --  but only as if  --  for guidance . The Warden , limpid soul , nodded with a sore and sympathetic pleasure . " Whatever you say , Mr. Queen . " The shoulders sagged . Almost deliberately . Despite Chief of Police Dakin 's precautions , they were spotted driving through Slocum , and by the time they drew up before Talbot Fox 's house in Wrightsville a considerable throng had gathered before the big iron gate . It was neither a menacing crowd nor a compassionate one ; simply Wrightsville gaping . But the moment held its terrors . Detective Howie hustled Bayard Fox up the walk , covering the frail figure with his Himalayan bulk . A faint flush at sight of the rubbernecks on the sidewalk colored Bayard 's cheeks ; but only for a moment . Then his gaze fixed upon the ivy-disheveled , shuttered house next door , and clung . He actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps ; Howie had to steady him with a secretly cruel paw . Ellery had been hopeful of the meeting between Bayard Fox and his family . He sought a hint , the least smear of a clue , from which to direct his researches . But the incident told him less than nothing . The family was assembled in the parlor in photographic postures . Talbot stood at one of the front windows peering through Emily 's faille curtains out at the crowd on the sidewalk . As the four men entered , Talbot turned from the window , a little pale , and hurriedforward with a forced smile . " Hello , Bay . " Bayard Fox regarded his elder brother for an instant without recognition . Then he mumbled : " Tal , " and looked away  --  searching . The vague glance rested on his sister-in-law , and awareness flickered again . Emily crept forward to cling to her husband 's arm . " Bayard , I 'm so glad  --  " She stopped in a sort of terror , and his glance wavered on  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office sprang into the sunken eyes as they found Davy in a corner , his arm tightly about Linda . " Son ! " Davy managed a grin . " Hello , Dad . Meet your daughter-in-law . Remember little Linny ? " Linda ran to the white-haired prisoner and threw her arms about him . From the way he stiffened , she realized she had made a serious mistake . Linda recoiled , smiling to conceal her confusion . " So you 're Linny , " said Bayard . " So grown-up . " And his eyes dismissed her . " Davy . " " Dad . "  |p67They  glanced at each other , and then away . That was all . A very bad scene , Ellery thought with irritation . It lacks color , drama , and above all significance . A man comes back from the dead and everyone is embarrassed , including the corpse , although he less than anyone . As Chief Dakin pushed a chair forward , Bayard smiled his vacant smile and sat down in it to fold his hands and rest them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of recognition  --  yes , there 's the grand piano with the same Spanish shawl all fringed with silk Emily used to have  --  I remember that  --  there 's the daguerreotype of Great-grandmother Finggren who went out to Illinois as a " Latter-day pioneer , " as Grandmother Harrison used to say  --  Talbot 's Harvard Classics on the mantelpiece , and the Danish meerschaum that came over from the old country with somebody 's great-uncle  --  they 've changed things around a bit , but it 's pretty much the same . . . . Ellery thought how perfectly calculated this bit of nostalgic byplay was to arouse the sympathy of an audience  --  the brittle , frail figure in the too big tapestried chair , smiling sadly at familiar things all but forgotten . If it was calculated . They were all talking now , all but Bayard , talking with great liveliness , about the dry spell since the bad storm , about Chief l ) akin 's daughter Elvy who had just married a Slocum boy , about the triplets old Doc Willoughby had delivered over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on their minds . " May I suggest , " said Ellery , " that we call the meeting to order ? " He smiled at Bayard , who started nervously . " Bayard , your sisterin-lawhas offered her home here as our headquarters . Very generously . However , if you have any objection  --  you see , Mrs. Fox , I 'm being brutally frank  --  we 'll take rooms at the Hollis or Upham House and operate from there . Which would you rather do , Bayard ? " " Which would . . . I rather do ? " The question seemed to confusehim . He paused helplessly , then he said : " This is very kind of you , Emily . " He repeated , " Very kind of you . "  | " Oh , Bayard ! " Emily burst into tears . " Now Emily  --  " thundered Talbot . " I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . " Emily swabbed her eyes with a , Bayard , " said Ellery . " Have you anything to tell us ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Ellery , " you might tell us whether you poisoned your wife twelve years ago . " Linda sucked in her breath ; it was the only sound in the room . " I guess you all think I want to be freed , " Bayard began slowly . " But I do n't know . Once I did , but maybe now I 'd rather stay where I am . It 's gotten to be sort of like home . " He sighed . " Davy , Mr. Queen told me on the drive over from the prison all about what 's happened to you . . . what you almost did to your .. . wife , and why . Mr. Queen says this investigation means  --  well , Davy , I guess if it means all that to you and Linda , I 'll do anything . " And now that tantalizing glitter was in his eyes again . " All I ask is that everybody tell the truth . That 's all I ask . The truth . " " But Dad . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen 's question . " Bayard regarded his son with the unconcealed tenderness of a woman . " I did not kill your mother , son . " It sounded like a man stating a truth . There was no slightest timbre of falsity . A simple and direct and  --  yes  --  hopeless statement of fact . Or was it the quintessence of cleverness ? The man , thought Ellery , is either the victim of the foulest circumstances , or an astoundingactor . " All right , " said Ellery ; his voice told nothing of his thoughts . " Then here 's my program . I 'm going to spend a few days ex/amining the court records of the trial . Then we 'll all get together in the house next door and retrace every step of the events of a dozen years ago . Every action , every statement , every remembered thought as far as possible . I propose to pull time back . Maybe in making history repeat itself we can get it to shout something now that it only whispered then , or was silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 'm trying to do here . The people involved are very few in number . And tied to one another by blood or marriage . If Bayard Fox is innocent , as he claims to be , then we may be faced with a most unpleasantsituation . " It was unnecessary to belabor the point . Their eyes mirrored the possibilities . " One thing more . " Ellery smiled at Davy and Linda . " These two young people have a tremendous stake in this investigation . They were virtually babies when Jessica Fox died . It is n't fair or right that they should be made to suffer as adults for someone 's duplicity when they were children . I 'm not saying there was duplicity ; I just do n't know . But if there was , I warn you now  --  I 'll follow this through till I corner the truth . No matter where it leads . No matter whom it hurts . " Is that clear ? To everyone ? " No one replied ; no one had to . " Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And now I 've got to get busy with those trial records . "  |p70THE  NEXT MORNING , having a half hour before his appointment with Prosecutor Hendrix , Ellery renewed his acquaintance with Wrightsville . It has n't changed much , he thought as he roamed about High Village . Some new stores ; a busy new City Parking Lot abutting Jezreel Lane , behind the Post Office and the Five-and-Dime ; Andy Birobatyan 's Florist Shop in the Professional Building adjoining the Kelton on Washington Street wore a different-colored paint ; Dr. Emil Poffenberger 's dental offices had disappeared ; the Hollis Hotel displayed a new marquee , very elegant ; in store windows on Lower Main and along Upper Whistling Avenue hung banners boasting one or two or three blue stars . But behind the plate-glass front of the Wrightsville Record , where Lower Main fed into the Square , Ellery could spy old Phinny Baker shining up the presses , as of yore ; Al Brown was serving New York College Ices in the ice-cream parlor next to Louie Cahan 's Bijou to boys and girls of Wrightsville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Square , which was round , Founder Jezreel Wright still brooded over the stone horse trough , his nose and arms decorated with bird-droppings and his verdigrised back set against John F. Wright 's Wrightsville National Bank on the northern arc of the Square  --  adjoining the grounds of the red-brick Town Hall , where State Street began . It was very like the Wrightsville Ellery had known ; it must be ,  |p71he  perceived , very like the Wrightsville Jessica Fox had known . Ellery strolled up State Street under the venerable trees . He passed Town Hall and glanced across the street to the Carnegie Library : Was Miss Aikin still enthroned there , he wondered , behind the stuffed eagle and the , moth-eaten owl ? And then he reached the " new " County Courthouse . It did not look so new now : the granite was dingy and the bronze letters over the Doric columns were in need of polishing , the broad flat steps were a little down at the heel . But the bars on the top-floor windows , where the County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imaginative moment Ellery almost saw Jim Haight 's tortured face glaring down at him from one of them . Prosecutor Hendrix was definitely cool . " Sure , we 're provincial , " said the Wright County Prosecutor severely . " We do n't like outsiders muscling into our town and shaking us up , Mr. Queen . I 'm an outspoken man . Bayard Fox got a fair trial twelve years ago ; the case is practically ancient history . Where 's the point ? " " There 's a bit more at stake , Mr. Hendrix , than the provincialism of Wrightsville  --  or even Bayard Fox . " " What ? " In confidence , Ellery told him . " Well . " Hendrix pursed his Yankee lips . " I must say it 's a darned funny kind of therapy . " He did not bother to disguise his hostility . " Captain Davy Fox , " Ellery pointed out slyly , " is currently Wrightsville 's proudest possession . " " Yes . Of course . " Hendrix looked uncomfortable . " I 'm sorry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump in the dark , Mr. Queen . Your investigation wo n't do the boy anything but harm , because it 'll only raise his hopes and you ca n't help but disappoint him . " Bayard Fox murdered his wife twelve years ago , and that's all there is to it . You 're wasting your time . " He did not add " and mine , " but that was what his tone implied . It had begun to be an annoying refrain , and Ellery scowled . " By the way , Mr. Hendrix , who was Prosecutor of Wright County during the Fox trial ? " " Tom Garback . " " Garback ? " " He was one of Judge Eli Martin 's bright boys  --  the old fellow used to handpick ' em and train them himself . Made a good Prosecutor , too , Tom did , even though it was n't my party . " " Garback , " mused Ellery . " Was n't there a Garback  --  Myron ! Myron Garback was a witness in the Haight case  --  owns the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecuted Fox ? " " Tom 's older brother . Incidentally , Myron does n't own the High Village Pharmacy any more . He dropped dead of heart diseaselate in ' 42 or ' 43 , was it ?  --  and his widow sold out to Alvin Cain and moved to California . " " Alvin Cain . " The name struck a soft pedal . Cain ? Then Ellery remembered the look on Davy Fox 's face in the Queen living room in New York . " Oh , yes . Well , Mr. Hendrix , it may be necessary for me to talk to Tom Garback . Where can I find him ? " " Ask the White House , " grinned Prosecutor Hendrix . " Tom was called to Washington years ago  --  confidential work on PennsylvaniaAvenue . Last I heard , he was off somewhere on a mission for the President . He might be in Paris , or Moscow , or wherehave-you . Local boy makes good ! " " You sound bitter , " grinned Ellery . " In that case , Mr. Hendrix , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official records of the Fox trial available to me . . . eh ? " The Prosecutor threw up his hands . Four days later , Ellery dropped into Chief of Police Dakin 's office.  | " I was wonderin ' what happened to you , " said the Chief . " Boned up , have you ? " " I 've been studying the old court records . " " Nose out anything ? " " If you mean errors T no . " Chief Dakin sighed . " I told you , Mr. Queen . It was an openand-shutcase . " " Oh , certainly . " Ellery stared out the ( thief 's window at the Wrightsville Light &; Power Company and the Northern State Telephone Company buildings across State Street . The serene old elms he remembered intervened , but they were agitated this morning ; it was a sunless , blustery day . " But then I did n't expect to find anything startling . I 've assumed all along that if there 's anything to be found , it will take more than library work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very well , I must say , considering that Detective Howie 's taken his orders literally and insists on occupying the same bed . Emily Fox has given them the south room on the first floor . " " Tough on Bayard , " said Dakin . " He 's up to it . Not so shy  --  he 's loosened up considerably , though there 's a good deal of strain between him and his brother Talbot . I wonder if there 's anything behind that . Was there , ever ? " " Not that I know of . They always got along in business fine . " " So I understand . Anyway , Bayard sits around all day talking over old times with Davy  --  when Davy 's around , which is n't often ; it 's not easy for Davy  --  or getting acquainted with Linda , to whom he 's taken a shine , and filling out on Emily 's fruit pies . " " That woman bakes a fillip ' pie . " The Chief grunted . " So now what , Mr. Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typewritten list of names . Dakin scanned the list slowly . " You want these people ? " " Yes . " " When ? "  | " On call from now on . They 're still in town ? " " Yep . Even young Jackson , the Negro boy . " " That 's more than I could have hoped for . Why do you say even ' young Jackson ? " " Abe L. 's in the Army  --  he 's Henry Clay Jackson 's son , the buttlin ' Jackson . " Ellery nodded , grinning . He recalled old Henry Clay in his buttling suit announcing dinner at the John F. Wrights ' when Hermione Wright had introduced Ellery to her " intime " Wrightsville friends during his first visit to the town . " But I saw Abe on State Street only this mornin ' . You 're holdin ' your gettogetherat the Bayard Fox house , Mr. Queen ? " " Oh , yes . I believe in atmospheres , Dakin . " Ellery drummed softly on the Chief 's desk , staring out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to be on the gruesome side , " he muttered . Dakin winced . " Must you ? " " It 's where the murder took place . " " But that house is a tomb , Mr. Queen . It 's been sealed up for a dozen years . I 'd feel like a grave-robber . " " Let 's both feel like grave-robbers . " The Chief stared . " Because I need a friendly presence , " complained Ellery . " I 'm out to save two young people from a fate at least as bad as death , Howie is a depressing leech , and I need a friendly presence , Dakin . " Dakin reached for his visored hat . " May 's well be hanged for a fool as a jackass , " he grunted , shrugging . " Okay , Mr. Queen , let 's go rob that grave . " Later that morning , Ellery led a nervous procession across two lawns to the stained and weather-cracked door of Bayard Fox 's house . An impression , almost an impact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door with the tarnished key Emily Fox had preserved in her " trinket box " next door for twelve years.  |p75As  he pushed the door open , it screamed . It was as if the house itself were screaming at being awakened from its long sleep . And when they walked into the musty foyer the feeling was intensified . For the drawer of a mahogany reception table gaped , as if it had just been jerked open . Inside they could see a puppy 's leather collar , a frosted electric bulb , mess of papers  --  greeting cards , laundry hills , scribbled housekeeping memoranda , old letters  --  a torn hairnet , some marbles , a Wrightsville Record dated June 2 , 1932 , some cracked snapshots . . . the litter and clutter of a " rumpus " drawer such as all living households , no matter how efficiently managed , can not escape maintaining . And on the plum-striped satin seat of a mahogany chair beside the table lay a boy 's pullover red sweater , where it had been cheerfully tossed as if only yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine dust and a swarm of moths , and collapsed . One corner of the domestic Oriental rug lapped over where a hurrying foot had tripped over it twelve years before . A Maxfield Parrish reproduction ogled them from the streaked wallpaper above the table , in need of a decent leveling touch . Through the blanket of gray dust and the webs of spider generations which choked the corners of the hall ceiling they perceived a house , not in death , but in suspended animation . " The dirt , " said Emily Fox . " Talbot , I told you we should have kept the house up  --  " Talbot shook his head , peering about . Davy and Linda kept close together , almost furtively . But Bayard Fox had come alive . His cheeks shone , his sunken eyes sparkled . He stood there looking around and sniffing , almost tasting , his house . " It 's just the same , " he said in a pleased voice . " It 's exactly the same . " Bayard broke into a curious little run , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Detective Howie , startled , took a heavy step in pursuit . But he stopped short , for Bayard Fox had stopped short . . . stopped to gaze into a room , an ordinary enough room , a typical Wrightsville Hill living room , but Bayard was looking at it as if therein lay the secret of all his lifetime and he was viewingit from some afterlife , with humility and wonder . He went in ; and , infected by his mood , they followed him almost on tiptoe . Muttering , Chief Dakin hurled the windows and shutters open . A breeze blew in , and the sour air stirred sluggishly . And after a while it became almost breathable . " I want the picture , " said Ellery . " I want the picture of Jessica Fox as she was just before the tragedy . " He glanced at Bayard ; but Bayard 's eyes were on the sofa , a French-provincial reproduction . Ellery wondered what there was in that undistinguished piece of furniture to attract the man . But then he realized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the afghan that lay upon it . It was imaginatively made , the work of a woman clever with her fingers . It lay on the sofa , its colors unfaded , and one had merely to squint in order to see a pallid woman with clever fingers lying under it there , in the dust . " Jessica had been sick for months , " began Davy 's father in a warm voice , studying the afghan . " She 'd had pneumonia  --  lobar , I think Dr. Willoughby called it  --  and it was a wonder she did n't die of it , because she never was what you 'd call a well woman , Mr. Queen  --  always delicate . Remember , Davy ? " And Davy mumbled : " I remember , Dad . " " For the first two months I 'd had both a day and a night nurse for her . The day nurse was Miss Hinchley , I remember , of the Junction Hinchleys , a very nice woman  --  Jessie liked her . The night nurse I ca n't recall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Emily unexpectedly . Then she blushed and shrank into a shadow . " That 's right , Emily , " said her brother-in-law , nodding . " Mrs. Grueniger . Jessie thought she was an old witch . But we could n't get anyone else , and besides the woman knew her business . Dr. Willoughby recommended her highly . "  | " Excuse me , " said Ellery . He asked Chief Dakin : " Have you got in touch with Dr. Willoughby ? " " He 's at the hospital , operatin ' , " replied Dakin . " Doc 'll be here soon as he 's through , Mr. Queen . " " Go on , Bayard . " ' " But after two months , while Jessie was still pretty sick , I sent the nurses away . " Bayard was addressing the afghan . " Jessica was a sick girl , but I sent them away . " For a moment the silence was disturbing . " I recall that from the trial transcript , " murmured Ellery , " although I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bayard ? " Bayard said : " Yes , Mr. Queen , there certainly was . " Someone in the room choked , but when Ellery looked around they were all as before , tense and uniformly pale . He glanced at Dakin . The Chief nodded ever so slightly in the direction of Talbot Fox . " I fired the nurses , " continued Bayard softly , " and I decided to take care of my wife myself . My brother and I were in business together and there was n't any great problem about my staying home during a crisis . We agreed Talbot was to keep the shop going by himself till I got Jessie on her feet again . " Talbot had to hawk several times before he could say : " That 's right . And I did , too . Pulled for both of us . " There was the most curious note of defensiveness in his voice . " Yes , Tal , I must say you did , " replied his brother . By the prickling of his wrists Ellery knew that at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not come out at the trial . Why it should emerge now he could not fathom , except that twelve years in a prison cell may well change a man 's sense of values , and what was cause for silence then might be cause for speaking now . Talbot kept clearing his throat . " I remember the day just as plain  --  " continued Bayard . " Which day , please ? " demanded Ellery . " The day Jessica was strong enough to come downstairs for the first time , Mr. Queen . It was a fine warm sunshiny morning early in June . . . well , not early , maybe . The fourteenth of June , it was . I do n't suppose I 'll ever forget that date . June 14th , 1932 . " Looking about him , Ellery thought : No , nor will these others . " The room looked . . . just the way it looks now . The windows were open , the curtains were blowing in , and I fixed my wife up snug on the sofa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was awfully proud of the afghan . She 'd made it herself . " " I remember , " murmured Linda ; she was hanging onto Davy 's arm , the motheaten sweater clutched to her breast . " I used to ask her if I could n't take it to play house with , and Aunt Jessie 'd always say : Now baby , you 'd only get it dirty , ' and give me a cookie to make up for things . " Bayard smiled faintly . " Yes , Jessica was a great one for not letting things get spoiled , Linda . Anyway , she was feeling pretty well that morning . Had fine color in her cheeks . I guess she was excited , coming downstairs after that long bout in bed , because she did n't want any breakfast  --  said she was n't hungry . I was worried about that , because Jessie had n't eaten since supper the night before , and she needed to build up her strength . When I started to insist she eat some eggs , or at least a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . Doc Willoughby had told me not to get her excited , so when she compromised by letting me talk her into having at least some grape juice , I let it go at that . " " I believe you had no help in the house at that time ? " Ellery said . " Not steady help , Mr. Queen . We 'd lost Maizie Le Roche , our servant girl , and Jessie 'd had a time getting another good one , and then she came down with the pneumonia , so through Emily I hired one of the Polish women of Low Village who work out part-time to come in twice a week to clean up  --  just a few hours a week . Davy and I used to make the meals and wash the dishes  --  remember , Davy ? " And again Davy said : " I remember , Dad . " " This particular morning the part-time cleaning woman was not in the house ? " " No . She was n't due for a couple of days . "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . " " Yes . Up here school does n't let out for the summer till the end of June . My wife and I were alone in the house . " Chief Dakin coughed . " Excuse me . . . That 's not exactly so , Mr. Fox . Was n't your brother here , too ? " " Oh , yes . I thought he meant when I first brought Jessie downstairs . Yes , Talbot was here , too , a little later . " " That came out in the trial , " Emily Fox said in a smothered voice . " And for that matter , I was here , too . I 'd dropped in with some flowers for Jessie  --  " " First things first , Mrs. Fox , " smiled Ellery . " Yes , I remember the testimony on that point . Your husband had dropped by to discusssome matter concerning the machine-shop with your brotherin-law . Is n't that so , gentlemen ? " " No . " Bayard almost snarled it . " No ? " said Ellery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , and I will . And Tal , you 'd better , too ! I do n't know what it means , if it means anything , but Mr. Queen wanted the truth and , by God , that 's the truth ! I 've had twelve years in prison , Tal , and Jessie 's been sleeping under a tree on Twin Hill for twelve years . Nothing can hurt us any more ! And if this hurts you and Emily . . . I 'm sorry , Tal , but my son means more to me than anybody ! " Talbot , who had opened his mouth , now closed it without having employed its mechanism for his intended purpose . His features were darkly crimson ; he was perspiring . " You mean , Bayard , that your brother did n't drop in that morning to discuss a business matter ? " " He did n't drop ' in at all . I phoned him and told him to come over for a talk without fail . And no  --  it was n't about business . " Davy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bewilderment . " But Talbot testified on the stand , " said Ellery mildly , " that it was a mere business conversation . I recall no contradiction , Bayard , of your brother 's testimony . "  |p80Bayard  grinned  --  how like a fox , Ellery thought ; it 's true ; in a queer way he looks like one . " At the time , I thought it was better to let it go at that . Jessie was n't dead very long , and I could n't bring myself to drag something out in court that gossips like Emmeline DuPre would use to throw at my wife 's grave . " " The other man ! " burst out Emily . Talbot 's wife had been standing there quietly , but holding herself in , growing paler and paler . Now , when she gave voice to that agony , it was as if a dam had burst somewhere deep within her . And so it came out  --  at the beginning of Ellery 's probe it came out  --  and he stood back and let it come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony about " another man , " but despite the most strenuous efforts of the prosecution  --  and indeed of the defense attorney , although for a different purpose  --  the mystery of the " other man 's " identity had not been penetrated . And in the end it had been dropped , unsolved . But not before the Jury had been persuaded that Jessica Fox and Bayard Fox and the unknown male had formed the familiar triangle , thus supplying a motive for the husband to have sought the wife 's life which even the dullest-witted talesman could grasp . The major fact had been the outstandingfact : Only Bayard Fox could have poisoned his wife . And for this fact there had been ample and unbudging evidence . Nevertheless , to discover now , of a sudden , after twelve years , that the " other man " had been , not some stranger with a blank face , but Bayard Fox 's own brother . . . somehow the motive loomed larger . Ellery put the pieces together from the sidelines of that damp , dusty room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Emily each thirty-five , Davy and Linda ten and nine . Two families , living next door to each other  --  a vigorous , handsome Talbot Fox and a timid , rather faded Emily , with Linda romping about their house ; and next door slim , shut-in , a little sad , Bayardp81Fox , and the tall , passionate woman who was his wife , with little Davy . It should have been , Ellery thought , fairly obvious . And yet , from the trial records and the contemporary newspaper accounts , no one had suspected . Truth will out , he thought , but it takes its sweet time about it sometimes . " I first got wind of it , " Bayard declared calmly , " in the early stages of Jessie 's pneumonia . She was delirious at night sometimes , and once , while that fat nurse  --  Mrs. Grueniger  --  was resting in the next room and I was alone with my wife , she called out in her delirium for my brother . I could n't be mistaken about why she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as soon as I could I got rid of both nurses , as I said a few minutes ago . I did n't want talk . " Then it happened again . My eyes had to stay open , whether I wanted them to or not . And so I began to notice things  --  a lot of things  --  little things  --  things I 'd been blind to before . My brother 's concern about my wife . The way my wife looked at him when she thought nobody was watching . The way Tal would phone . Things like that . " By the time Jessie was well enough to get out of bed , I knew practically the whole story without ever having said a word either to her . . . or to him . " " It 's past . It 's past and done with , " choked his brother . " Bay , for the love of heaven , what 's the sense of raking all that up now ? " " He wanted the truth , " said Bayard with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is n't it , Talbot ? " " Yes ! " his brother shouted . " Yes , it 's the truth , damn it ! All right , it 's the truth ! " " And I 've lived in your house all these years , " said Davy Fox to his uncle with his sweet smile . " Davy ! Mother , please  --  " began Linda wildly . But Emily had dropped onto the dusty seat of one of the chairs and was staring out the window . " Now Emily , " groaned Talbot . He stopped , very pale now.  | " I did n't say or do anything about it , " continued Bayard almostgently , " till that morning when I brought Jessica downstairs . Just before I brought her down , I phoned Tal next door and asked him to drop by on his way to the shop  --  told him to be sure to come in by the kitchen door so Jessie would n't hear us . I tucked her in on the sofa and went into the kitchen to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tal came up the back porch and we had it out . In the kitchen . " Tal said hoarsely : " Now wait a minute , Bay . " Bayard waited . The bigger brother wiped his forehead and neck with a handkerchief that shook . " All right , so it 's come out . . . Emily . I 'm talking to you , too . " " I 'm listening , Talbot , " said his wife without taking her eyes from the lawn . " You must n't get the wrong idea about this , any of you . Any of you . Davy , do n't glare at me so . Your mother and I  --  we could n't help it . Those things happen , Davy . Emily , they happen . It does n't make a man a skunk or a woman a  --  a floozey when they do . I swear to God Almighty there was nothing between Jessie and me that either of us could have been ashamed of  --  at any time . Do you hear me ? The lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emily , you 've got to ! You 've lived with me enough years to know what I am . I have no backbone sometimes but  --  you know what I am . And you know what Jessie was  --  how fine , what a lady . We fell in love , and we fought it like fury . But we fought a losing battle . We lost out . All without so much as touching each other 's hand , I tell you ! " Talbot stopped . He was about to say more . But then his mouth tightened . Emily sat in her bitter corner , hands in her lap , staring out Jessica Fox 's window . " We had it out , " said Bayard , as if his brother had not spoken at all , " right there in the kitchen . I told Tal what I 'd found out , and he admitted it right off . I 'll give him that . He told me almost exactly what you just heard . And I believed him . I was n't mad . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tal was my elder brother andp83a darned fine man , and he 'd never clone a thing to me that I could call mean or underhanded . So I could n't he mad . " Then why is there that excited triumph in your voice , Bayard ? Ellery thought . He could see them , the big handsome brother and the frail plain one , facing each other in Jessica Fox 's kitchen while she lay on the sofa under the afghan in this very room , tasting the joy of life regained . Ellery almost heard their inflections . Two intelligent men , brothers , discussing a cruel and surprising problem , and both too uncomfortable about it to take bold slashes at the tangle in which they stood trapped . At least that was the picture as Bayard painted it ; and Talbot noddedalmost with eagerness . " I told Bayard I loved Jessie , " Talbot put in at one point , " and that I did n't know what to do about it . And I told him Jessie was mixed up and undecided , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " Thank you , " said Emily , " Talbot . " Talbot reddened . " It was the contact that made it so bad , " he went on doggedly . " Living next door  --  Bay and I tied by a successfulbusiness partnership  --  and Jessie and I feeling we could n't go on living like liars , either  --  without each other , and still practicallytouching each other . It was plain hell , and I was glad to get it off my chest and tell Bayard about it . " " We worked it out , " said Davy 's father dreamily . " We agreed the decision had to be Jessie 's  --  that whatever Jessie decided , Tal and I would stick by . " But one of you did not , thought Ellery . Or did you both ? " We decided , " Bayard went on , " that we 'd do nothing at all till Jessica got completely well , unless she did something about it herselfbeforehand . " He pressed his thumbs to his eyelids in a gesture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on exactly ? " " That if Jessie decided to stick by you , Bay , " muttered his brother , " I was to sell out my share of the business to you and move my family from Wrightsville . Out of the state . Make a clean break . For good . "  | " That 's it , " nodded Bayard . Had he really forgotten ? " And if she picked Tal , I 'd step out  --  sell out to Tal , arrange for a divorce , and go away with Davy . " " Arid me ? " asked Emily . " What was to happen to me and Linda ? Did you two agree on that , too ? " " Well , now , " replied her husband in a mumble , " if Jessie decided to leave Bay and marry me  --  why , Emily , naturally I 'd have provided for you and Linny  --  " " Thank you , " said Emily . " That was considerate of you , Talbot . " She kept looking out at the sunless world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Mother , " said Linda . " Please , Mother . " " I could n't help it , Emily ! " His wife turned from the window then . " No , Talbot , I expect you could n't . I just wish you had n't kept it from me  --  I wish you had n't kept quiet about it all these years . I wish you 'd been as honest with me then as you were with Bayard  --  and Jessie . " But then she died , Emily ! And what good would it have done to hurt you ? " " I wish you had told me , " said Emily . " And when she died , I saw how wrong it had all been  --  " " Oh , did you ? " " Wrong , and still right . How can a man get out of a mess like that ? Wrong , and right , too ! And afterwards , when Bay was sent up to . . . " But Talbot did not pursue that spoor . " I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wrong . Some way . To Bayard  --  by taking his son into our home and bringing him up as if he were my own . To you , Emily  --  by being the husband you 'd a right to expect me to be . And I have been , Emily , you know that  --  " " Did you love Jessie very much , Talbot ? " Her tone was curious . He paled . " Do n't ask me that , Emily  --  " " Do you still love her ? " " How can you ask me that ? " he cried . " Twelve years , Emily ! " " You always were a weakling in some things , Talbot , " said his wife with a sort of contempt.  |p85His  glance fell . And in the uncomfortable silence they became conscious of an incongruity . They looked about , blankly . But it was only Detective Howie . He was whistling a merry , jeering little tuneless tune through his fat lips . " We decided not to tell you anything , Emily , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe the time would never come  --  maybe Jessie would choose to stay with me . And then you would n't have had to know at all . I 'm sort of sorry you had to find out now , Emily . After all these years . But Mr. Queen wanted the truth . " Emily Fox gripped the arms of her dead sister-in-law 's chair . " You men , " she cried in a passionate voice . " You think you know it all . You think you can make a woman or break her . You think the whole world revolves around you . Find out now , Bayard ? I 've known all about Talbot and Jessica for twelve years ! " " You . . . what ? " Talbot Fox feebly asked his wife . " Do you think I was deaf , Talbot , or blind ? " " But you never said a word . You never let on , Emily  --  not once  --  " She sat up stiffly in the chair , as if her back hurt . Her hands lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " Talbot groped toward the window nearest him and stood there , his back to the room . " Anyway , " said Bayard with a deep sigh , " that 's what Talbot and I talked about in the kitchen that morning while I was preparing a pitcher of grape juice for Jessica . " " Ah , yes , " said a cool voice ; and they all started . But it was only Ellery , emerging from the corner shadow in which he had been standing . " Yes , " he said . " That brings us to the grape juice . "  | CHIEF DAKIN SAID : " HOLD IT , Mr. Queen , " and lumbered from the room . When he returned , he had big old thick-chested Dr. Milo Willoughby in tow . " Thought I heard that jalopy of yours laborin ' up the Hill , Doc , " the Chief was saying . " I got here soon as I could , Dakin , " growled Dr. Willoughby . " Three appendectomies this morning  --  they always come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Hello , Doctor . " They shook hands warmly . Ellery had been fond of the blunt old physician , and it was pleasant to see him again . But Dr. Willoughby 's heavy shoulders were drooping this morning . He glanced around the room , it seemed to Ellery , with an unaccustomed lack of ease . It brings back memories to Doc Willoughby , too , Ellery thought . " Hello , Bayard , " said the doctor quietly . " Hello , Dr. Willoughby . " Neither man offered his hand . After the doctor had nodded to the others , he said to Ellery : " I did n't mean to interrupt anything . " " You know what we 're trying to do , Doctor ? " " Dakin told me when he phoned . " " Could you hang around for a while ? " " I 'm afraid not . I have a few calls to make , and then I must be getting over to my office for my regular office-hours . " " You 'll be there the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Village decides to have her twins today instead of tomorrow . " " All right , Doctor , I 'll probably call you later . "  |p87Dr  . Willoughby left Bayard Fox 's house in what Ellery thought was considerable relief . And after a very few moments they heard his car scuttling down the Hill . Did Dr. Milo Willoughby , who knew more secrets about more people iii Wrightsville than even Emmy DuPre , know something about the death of Jessica Fox which he had never disclosed ? It seemed improbable . Still , Ellery ii made a mental note . " I think we can proceed , " he said briskly . " Bayard , tell me precisely what happened when you went into the kitchen that morning twelve years ago to prepare your wife 's grape juice . " " But if you 've read the testimony , Mr. Queen  --  " " I want it all over again , from you , Bayard . In the most finicking detail . " Bayard frowned . " When I first went into the kitchen  --  before Talbot dropped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grape juice , I found we 'd run out . Jessie 'd always loved grape juice , and we used to go through a lot of it , especially in the summer time . Anyway , I phoned the grocery to send up half a dozen quart-size bottles right away . " " Logan 's Market , the one on the corner of Slocum Avenue and Washington Street ? " " That 's right . We bought all our groceries and meats there . After I phoned the order  --  our phone was in the hall just outside the kitchen , Mr. Queen  --  I went back into the kitchen and got a pitcher and tumbler down . It 's while I was doing that that my brother came in and we had our talk . " " So we have you and Talbot in the kitchen , over the pitcher and nimbler , discussing the quadrangular problem of your households , while you waited for Logan 's to deliver a fresh supply of grape juice . Now , Emily Fox . It was brought out at the trial that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juice  --  you also stopped in . " Emily turned from the window . " I beg your pardon ? "  | " You dropped in , Mrs. Fox . You began to tell us about that before . " " Oh . Yes , " said Emily . " I 'd picked some branches of white and purple lilac in my back garden . I knew Jessie was to come downstairsthat morning and I thought she 'd enjoy having some fresh flowers . So I walked over with them . " " You entered this house  --  let me see . . . was it by the front door , Mrs. Fox , or the rear door ? " " The rear , Mr. Queen . Through the kitchen . " " Then you must have run into your husband there , talking to your brother-in-law ? " " Yes . " Emily 's back became straighter . " I was surprised , because I thought Talbot had gone directly to the shop . But Tal said he 'd stopped by to discuss some business with Bayard , and Bayard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living room , where Bayard said Jessica was lying down . She was resting on the sofa , the afghan over her legs . She made a nice fuss about the lilacs , I remember . I went upstairs to the bathroom , filled a vase with water , brought it back down , and put the lilacs in . We talked a while . " " About what , Mrs. Fox ? " Emily started . " I do n't really recall , Mr. Queen . Nothing important , I 'm sure . " Ellery smiled . " Your testimony on the witness stand twelve years ago was that you talked about how Jessica felt after her long illness , about spring cleaning  --  which was long overdue in Jessica 's establishment and about which she felt badly  --  about how nicely Linda and Davy got along , considering that they were at the boyhates-girlage  --  " Davy and Linda gripped hands furtively  --  " and about how bad your husbands kept saying business was . " " It 's so long ago , " sighed Talbot 's wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fox . And then you left ? " " Yes . I was there only a few minutes . " " By which door did you leave , Mrs. Fox  --  can you recall ? " " The front , I think . . . yes , the front . " Ellery nodded ; that had been her testimony . " I remember I did n't go out through the kitchen way because I did n't want to disturb the men 's . . . business talk . "  | " Oh , that was the reason ? By the way , Mrs. Fox , do you happen to recall this ? On your way into the house  --  when you first came through the back yard approaching the kitchen door with the lilacs for Jessica  --  were the kitchen windows open or closed ? " " The kitchen windows ? " Emily shook her head . " I really ca n't say , Mr. Queen . " " I do n't blame you , " said Ellery with a smile . " Such a trivial detail . But try to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen door , could you hear your husband and Bayard talking inside ? From the back yard ? From the back porch ? " " Well , now . . . wait . Yes . I think I did hear their voices . Mumbly , sort of . You know how you hear voices sometimes without being able to make out the words . " " As a matter of fact , " Bayard said suddenly , " the windows were open , Emily . I remember because it had rained during the night and I 'd had to get up about 3 A.M. and go around the house closing all the windows . So when I got up that morning the first thing I did was open them all again , throughout the house . " " Then the kitchen windows were open , " said Ellery . " I 'd been wondering about that . " He did not explain why he had been wondering about it , but continued pleasantly : " Suppose we all go into the kitchen . We 'll continue our investigation there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ladies who live on the Hill . No skimpy ten-by-ten city " boxes " for them , thank you ! In Wrightsville the kitchen is the hearth and the refuge  --  the tavern , as it were  --  of the family group , and it is built to generous dimensions , to take a big range and a big refrigerator and a big table and many kitchen chairs . There are cupboards and closets for every culinary and housekeeping purpose  --  and then room to spare . The dead woman 's kitchen would have been approved by the most exacting matron in town . Even through the dust and rust and tarnish of a dozen untended years its sturdy housewifely character shone . One long wall was all cupboard-unit , built around a double porcelain sink : cabinets above , and cupboards below , the cupboards divided into numerous drawers , the cabinets an army of glassfrontedhousewife 's delights , their shelves daintily edged with scallopedblue-and-white oil cloth and crowded with dishes , ordinary and " company , " glassware likewise of the " common " or everyday and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utensils , gadgets , spices , condiments , " pickles , " herbs , cereals , and all that endless array of accessories to good housekeeping without any one of which the Wrightsville matron would have felt positivelyimpoverished . On the opposite wall stood a large white range with two ovens and a warming oven and six burners . A double-doored , six-foot electric refrigerator stood against the same wall . A vast porcelaintoppedtable occupied the axis of the kitchen , and strong white wooden chairs were neatly tucked beneath it . Above the double sink was a double window , looking out upon the other side from the Talbot Foxes ' . A door , fitted out with an accessory screen door for summer use , was set into the rear wall . Chief Dakin had opened the solid door as well as the windows , and they could see through the rusted screening the back porch and the garden , now a lofty forest of weeds , and the walk curving off through it toward the corresponding garden at the rear of the Talbot Fox house . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Davy Fox grinned feebly . " There 's my old checker game . " It was on the kitchen table , its black and red discs still in position on the board  --  a game which had been begun twelve years before and had never been finished . " It 's weird , " said Linda with a little shiver . " We played that previous night , Davy , " said Bayard with a smile . " But we stopped in the middle because you had to go to bed . " " It 's kind of dim , Dad . " " You accused me of stopping the game because you were lickingthe pants off me . And you were , too . " Bayard looked about , stillp91smiling faintly . There were two copper-bottomed pots on the range , green-black with age . The handles on the refrigerator were tarnished to the color of gunmetal . The dampness of twelve unheated wintershad warped and cracked the blue-and-white squares of the floor linoleum , and dust covered everything . But Bayard did not seem to notice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . " These windows . The screens , " said Ellery . They were the full-window type of screen , which fits on like a storm window , fastens to the inside by a hook , and does not interfere with the opening or closing of the window . " Are these the identical screens which were on the windows that morning twelve years ago ? " " Yep , " said Chief Dakin . " If you 're thinkin ' maybe the kitchen screens  --  or any of the other screens in the house  --  were tampered with from the garden or the drive out there . . . from outside ... I can promise you they were n't , Mr. Queen . I checked ' em all myself first thing , in the original investigation . " Ellery dismissed the mysterious subject of the kitchen windows abruptly . " All right , Bayard . Let 's go through the business . I assumethe original pitcher and tumbler you used that morning in preparing the grape juice are n't here  --  " " They were evidence in his trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own voice seemed to startle him . Abashed , he sneered defensively . Ellery ignored him . " Bayard , is there another pitcher and tumbler here like the ones you used ? " " There ca n't be another pitcher , " replied Bayard . " It was part of an iced-drink set  --  one pitcher and eight tumblers . There ought to be some of the tumblers on the shelf here , though . " He scanned the glass-paned wall cabinet immediately to the left of the sink . " Yes . There they are , Mr. Queen . " Ellery went to the cabinet and tried to open it . But it was stuck fast ; dampness had swollen the wood frame . Chief Dakin produced an all-purpose pocket knife , and between them they managed to pry the cabinet door open . Ellery took down one of the tumblers which Bayard had indi- cated and blew the dust from its surface . It was a heavy glass , dark purple in color and virtually opaque ; its massive exterior had been cut in an ornate bunch-of-grapes pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtfully . " This is exactly like the one you used that morning , Bayard ? " " Oh , yes . Part of the same set . " " Was the pitcher of the identical color and design ? " " Yes . " " Too bad we have n't the original pitcher . Well , we 'll make shift with a substitute . This one up here should do . " Ellery took down a very ordinary two-quart pitcher of clear glass , blew on it , and handed it to Bayard with the purple tumbler . " Now show me just what you did when you took the original pitcher and glass from the purple iced-drink set out of this cabinet . " Bayard set them down on the porcelain drainboard of the sink . " Oh , no , " said Ellery with a smile . " The testimony was that you rinsed both the pitcher and tumbler at the sink just after taking them from the cabinet . " Bayard reddened . " Is that so ? I 've forgotten . " " Naturally . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass ? " " That 's all . " " Was anything else standing on the drainboard or in the sink , Bayard ? " " No . I 'd washed and wiped Davy 's and my breakfast dishes that morning after Davy left for school , but before Jessie came downstairs . The drainboard was bare . There was n't anything on it but the pitcher and glass . " Ellery stood ruminating over what he knew of the story from havingstudied the trial records . Jessica Fox had had no breakfast that morning . Her last meal had been eaten the night before , a meal shared by both her husbandp93and her son , and from which none of them experienced ill effects . She had awakened the next morning fresh , strong , and elated over the adventure of going downstairs for the first time in months . The first and the only substance Jessica had put into her stomach that morning was the grape juice Bayard prepared for her . Two hours later she became violently ill . The fact that nothing had passed her lips that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , according to the testimony of her physician , Dr. Willoughby , to whom she had confided that all-important piece of information when the doctor arrived at Bayard Fox 's house in response to Bayard 's frantic summons . Apparently Dr. Willoughby had not suspected foul play at the very beginning . But a later piecing together of the evidence indicatedbeyond question  --  or at least to the satisfaction of an impressiveparade of medical luminaries  --  that Jessica had died of digitalis poisoning . The source of the drug was no mystery . A bottle of it , nearly full , had stood in the medicine chest in the upstairs bathroom . Jessica 's heart , never too strong , had weakened further under the strain of resisting the pneumonia , and Dr. Willoughby had prescribed for a very short time a daily dose of tincture of digitalis  --  a powerful cardiac stimulant , dark green in color , derived from the purple foxglove , which is commonly used in diseases of the heart to correct lost compensation . Jessica herself informed Dr. Willoughby that she had followed his orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , on Memorial Day . Yet both official and unofficial medical opinion , based upon the symptoms as later reviewed , and one salient fact , had been that Jessica Fox 's death was caused by a huge , killing overdose of digitalis , which must have been taken that morning . It was obvious , then , that she had not been the victim of an accidentaloverdose at her own hand in the normal course of " taking her medicine " ; it was equally obvious that the overdose had been deliberately given to her in something she had eaten or drunk that morning . And since by her own testimony the only thing she hadp94eaten or drunk that morning had been the grape juice , it was elementarythat the overdose of digitalis  --  the poisonous potion  --  had been administered to Jessica Fox in the grape juice . QUESTION : Exactly how did the poisonous overdose get into Jessica'sgrape juice ? It all simmered down to that . ELLERY ASKED CHIEF DAKIN : " Are Mr. Logan and Abraham L. Jackson here ? " " I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm ready for them . " Dakin went out . He returned shortly with a hatless , middle-aged white man with empurpled hands and face , who wore a bloody butcher 's apron over which he had hastily thrown a Norfolk jacket , and a nervous young Negro in Army uniform . " You 're Mr. Logan , " said Ellery , addressing the aproned man , " proprietor of Logan 's Market in High Village ? " " I am , " said Mr. Logan , wetting his lips . " I am . " " Do you recall testifying in the trial of Bayard Fox twelve years ago , Mr. Logan ? " " I guess I do . Yes , sir , I do . " " You were questioned specifically at that time about taking a telephone order from Mr. Fox for six quart-sized bottles of grape juice , on the morning of the day Mrs. Fox was allegedly poisoned . Do you remember that , Mr. Logan ? " " I sure do . " " I 'd like to hear that testimony again , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well . " Mr. Logan 's shrewd little eyes became reflective ; his first nervousness gone , he meant to make the most of his moment . " Near as I can recollect , I answered the phone in the store and Mr. Bayard Fox said to me : Mr. Logan , we 've run out of grape juice and Mrs. Fox is downstairs this mornin ' for the first time since she 's been so sick and she wants grape juice . Could you do me a special favor and send six quart bottles up the llill right away ? ' It was n't our regular delivery time , y'see , and Mr. Fox knew that , because he 'd been doin ' the orderin ' for months . Why , certainly , Mr. Fox , ' I said . Glad to oblige . Will there be anything else ? ' But he says no , he 'll phone me their regular midweek order next day . I did n't mind , because my customers are nearly all on the Hill , and I 've always found it 's good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Logan . Tell me  --  how did Bayard Fox sound over the telephone ? " " Sound ? " The tradesman blinked . " Why , all right , I guess . " " Did he seem happy ? " " Well . . . Mr. Fox never did sound exactly happy . " " You do n't remember . " Mr. Logan grinned weakly . " I guess you got me . " " What happened when you hung up ? " " I filled the order . " " Yourself . " " Yes . My clerks were all busy at the time , so I went over to thegrocery department  --  usually I stay behind the meat counter  --  and took six quart bottles of grape juice off the fruit-juice shelf  --  " " A national brand . " " Oh , yes . " " They were in metal-capped bottles ? " " That 's right . " " The bottles were in perfect condition when you took them off the shelf , Mr. Logan ? You did n't notice anything wrong with one of the caps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've sold I 'd say thousands of bottles of that brand of grape juice in my time , and I 've never had a complaint yet . " " Then what did you do ? "  | " Why , I said to Abe L. here  --  " The soldier started and tugged at his tunic  --  " Abe was a delivery boy for me at that time  --  ' bout fourteen , Abe , were n't you ? "  --  The soldier nodded vigorously  --  " I said to Abe : Abe L. , you take the Ford truck and run these bottlesof grape juice up the Hill to the Bayard Foxes ' . They want ' em right off . ' So Abe says Okay , Mr. Logan ' and the last I see of ' em Abe 's stowing ' em in an empty carton . " " Thanks very much , Mr. Logan . That 's all . " Mr. Logan lingered . " You wo n't need me any more ? " " I 'm sure we wo n't . Thank you . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the direction of Chief Dakin , but the Chief did not smile , so Logan slapped the soldier on the arm . " Do n't let ' em court-martial you , Abe . Good luck ! " he said and he went out , chuckling over his sally , which Ellery felt certain he would repeat to his clerks and customers for weeks to come . The soldier , thus deserted , gulped several times and then stood at attention . " Well , Corporal , " said Ellery with a grin , " I see you 've changed employers in the last twelve years . " Corporal Jackson looked astonished . Then he grinned back . " Yes , sir . I used to drive a delivery truck for Mr. Logan , now I 'm driving ditto for Uncle Sam . " " Home on leave , are you ? " " Yes , sir . " " Hi , Abe L. , " said Davy . " Remember me ? " Corporal Jackson showed his teeth . " Yes , sir , Captain . You sure showed those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sure did , " said Davy . " How 's Rose-Ann ? " " She married me . " " She always said she would ! " " Got a couple of kids , " said Corporal Jackson proudly . " Good for Rose-Ann . " " Good for me ! " And suddenly everyone , even Bayard , was smiling , in a sort of happiness , and Corporal Jackson was no longer nervous.  | " We wo n't keep you from your family long , Corporal , " said Ellery . " Do you remember delivering the grape juice to this house that morning twelve years ago ? " " Yes , sir . I remember the whole thing plain . " Ellery silently blessed the circumstance that had set the crime in Wrightsville rather than a large city . Any murder case in a town of ten thousand souls , half-industrial , half-rural , would be bound to become a cause celebre , details of which would he repeated for years by those lucky enough to have been involved , and so perpetuated . If there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories enlarged through repetition , there was also the contemporaneous testimony in the trial records as a frame of reference . It was not wonderful that the colored delivery boy of fourteen should , as a responsible citizen of twenty-six , recall the details of that grape-juice delivery twelve years before ; it would have been wonderful had he not done so . Corporal Jackson told his story with dignity , relish , and some transparent embellishment ; but the essence of it was an exact distillationof his testimony as a boy . He had placed the six bottles of grape juice into an empty carton at Logan 's Market . He had carried the carton out to the Ford truck parked in the narrow alley behind the store  --  the alley which the market shared with the side entrance of Upham House and the fire-exits at the rear of the Bijou Movie Theater . He had climbed behind the wheel and set the carton beside him on the empty companion-seat . He had not left the carton there and returned to the store , or gone around the corner to Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most vehement on that point ( as he had been on the witness stand under fire ) . After depositing the carton with the grape juice ( visible to him at all times , he insisted ) on the seat beside him , he had driven directly out of the alley into Washington Street , into the Square , into Lower Main , into Upper Whistling , and straight out Upper Whistling towards Hill Drive in the northeastern section of town . He had made no stopovers of any kind , for any purpose . ( " Once I got on Upper Whistling I did n't even shift gears till I got to thep98bottom of the Hill , and then only to go into second because the old truck would n't make it on high , " asserted Corporal Jackson . ) No one had hopped onto his running-board en route . No one had " hitched a ride " in the seat beside him . " Those bottles of grape juice were right alongside me till I drove into Mr. Fox 's driveway and stopped the truck and jumped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porch . " He had found the Fox brothers , both of whom he knew well , talking in the kitchen ; yes , he had noticed a purple pitcher and a purple glass on the drainboard , because as he set the carton down on the table he remembered Mr. Bayard Fox saying : " You got here almighty fast , Abe L.  --  thanks a lot . I 've got the pitcher waiting ! " And then Abe L. had handed Mr. Bayard the carbon copy of the bill Mr. Logan had made out and Mr. Bayard had said to tack the grape-juice charge onto the next regular-delivery bill , and Abe L. left by the back door just as Mr. Bayard was hoisting one of the quart bottles of grape juice from the carton . When Corporal Jackson had left , Ellery said to Bayard : " You took one of the six quarts of grape juice out of the carton . Did anything happen , Bayard  --  please try to remember  --  that dictated your choice of the bottle you selected ? " Bayard shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alike , and I simply took the first one my hand lit on . " " The other five bottles , Mr. Queen , " Chief Dakin interposed ,  --  were all analyzed by the Sieglitz Labs over at Connhaven . And so was the grape juice that was left in the quart bottle after Mr. Fox poured some off for Mrs. Fox 's drink . The Sieglitz Labs gave all the grape juice left in the bottles a clean bill . Absolutely pure , their report said .  --  " I know , Dakin , " said Ellery gently , " but you 'll forgive me if I go over the ground myself , in my own way . " Dakin colored and coughed . " So , Bayard , you took one of the bottles out of the carton at random . Then what ? "  | " Then I went to one of those drawers  --  " Bayard stared at the many drawers in the cupboard-unit , then shook his head  --  " I 've forgotten now which drawer it was kept in  --  and took out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bottle . And then I poured enough grape juice out of the bottle into the glass to fill it to the brim  --  the first of the two glassfuls of grape juice I poured from the bottle . " " Do you recall Bayard 's doing that , Talbot ? " asked Ellery suddenly . Talbot started . " Yes . Yes , Mr. Queen . That 's just what he did . I was standing right here when Bay filled the tumbler . " " It was at about this time , was n't it , Bayard , that there was anotherinterruption ? " " Interruption ? Oh . Yes . The drugstore delivered a bottle of aspirins . " Ellery glanced at the Chief of Police . " I 'd like to talk to Alvin Cain , please , " he said . Ellery beheld a man in a sculptured linen suit , panama in hand , hair combed carefully over a thin spot , who came in with a bounce , stopped short , and then looked around with quick little glances . There were brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath them . The pallor under his swarthiness gave his skin a lavender look . " Hello there , Linny . " Pharmacist Cain was nervous . " Hello , Alvin . " " Davy . How 's the boy ? " Davy did not reply . Cain 's glance darted at Bayard . He did not greet Davy 's father . He nodded respectfully , however , to the Talbot Foxes and then stood there , clutching the brim of his panama . Pharmacist Cain must have been just under thirty during the trial , thought Ellery . The super-fastidious type . . . on the surface ; one could not be sure of what lay beneath . Shoetips glistening.  |p100Clothes  without wrinkles and immaculate . Deeply burned by the sun ; he would play a desperate , swashbuckling , ineffectual game of golf . The small-town Beau Brummell , ever ready with a wisecrack , ever yearning for big cities , always avoiding them ; the joy of the local haberdashers . " Mr. Queen . " Chief Dakin beckoned . Ellery excused himself and joined Dakin in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " whispered Dakin . " Cain was mighty sweet on Linda Fox all the time she was growin ' up . I guess he still is . " " Davy mentioned something about it . But I did n't take it seriously . Linda  --  and that oaf ? " " Oh , it 's never meant anything to little Lin . But Cain  --  he 's the type thinks girls ca n't resist him . " " But he 's old enough to be her father . " " Alvin spends a lot of money preservin ' himself , " said the Chief dryly . " Anyway , his ideas ai n't paternal . " " He 's serious about Linda ? " " As serious as he could be about any woman . " " Thanks , Dakin . " They returned to the group . " I sha n't keep you long , Mr. Cain , " said Ellery smoothly . The man 's nervousness had increased during the whispered interchange between Ellery and the Chief . " Do you know what it is we 're trying to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phoned me . " Ellery could detect nothing in the man 's tone ; it was perfectly proper . " I take it you know what this means to Davy Fox  --  and Linda . " " It sounds squiffy to me , " said Alvin Cain . " But if you say so , pal  --  okay . " He smiled at Linda , showing his dimple . " I 'll do what I can , baby . " " Thanks , Alvin . " Davy swallowed  --  hard . " The only thing is , " said the pharmacist jauntily  --  " what ? " He flings a wisecrack , Ellery thought , into the very teeth of a THE FOX AND THE GRAPES IOIp101serious moment ; this makes him feel superior to the situation ; in reality , he is frightened and uncertain . " What you can do , Mr. Cain , is only what I 'm asking everyone to do : Tell the truth . " " Sure . Say ! " Alvin Cain flushed . " Why should n't I tell the truth ? I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carries a chip . It might mean something . " I 'm sure you have n't , " smiled Ellery . " Well , let 's get on . You own the High Village Pharmacy now , I understand , but at the time of the Fox trial twelve years ago you were merely a clerk there ? " Alvin had recovered . " Slaved for old Myron Garbage for twentyeightseeds per , " he said smartly . " I bought the store out  --  lock , stock , and good will  --  a couple of years ago when Garback dropped dead . Always said I would . " " You were a witness at Mr. Fox 's trial . " " Yeh man . About the aspirin . " " But your testimony , " interposed Chief Dakin slyly . " It was kicked right out the court window , Alvin . " Cain 's smile was half a snarl . " I ca n't help that , Chief . They subpoenaed me . I told ' em what I knew . Who cares what they did with it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , just a minute . Bayard , how did Alvin Cain come to deliver a bottle of aspirins that morn-ing ? " " I 'd phoned the High Village Pharmacy the night before , " Bayard explained . " Jessie 'd had a slight headache and wanted an aspirin , but when I went to look for some in the medicine chest , I could n't find any . So I phoned the Pharmacy . Alvin here answered  --  the clerk . I asked him if he 'd send over a bottle of 100 tablets right away . Alvin said he could n't leave the store alone  --  Garback 'd gone home early  --  but he 'd deliver a bottle in the morning . I hung up and ran over to Talbot 's next door and got a few aspirins from Emily  --  remember , Emily ? "  --  Emily Fox barely nodded  --  " and gave Jessie two , and it cleared up her headache in a half-hour . Then the next morning , while I was pouring the grape juice into the glasspIO2 in the kitchen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 tablets . " " Was n't there something more , Bayard ? " Ellery asked . " Somethingabout an argument between you and Cain over the phone the preceding night , when you called the Pharmacy ? " " Oh , that . " Bayard smiled a little . " You sure bawled me out , Foxy , " said Alvin Cain . There was contempt in his patronizing tones  --  quite unconscious , Ellery felt sure . Davy stiffened ; but Linda put her hand on his arm , and he relaxed . " What was the argument about , Mr. Cain ? " " When Fox asked me on the phone that previous night to deliver a bottle of 100 aspirins , I said : Say , Mr. Fox , what do you do with that stuff  --  eat it ? ' You know , cracking wise . But he gets sore and wants to know what right ' I have talking to him that way , ' and a lot more gilhooley like that . So I said , look , I delivered some rubbing alcohol and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday , and in the order was a bottle of 100 aspirins . Do n't tell me you 've used Too tablets in less than two days ! He got nasty and said nobody had to give me an accounting and what did I mean by keeping tabs ' on him that way , and I 'd better send a bottle over right away or he 'd report me to Mr. Garback . That got my monkey up . Look , Foxy old boy , I said , I do n't need Myron Garbage and I do n't need you , and as far as this job is concerned , Garback knows what he can do with it . And a lot more like that  --  about crabby customers , and so forth . Well , we had it out for a while , then we both cooled off and apologized , and finally I said I 'd run the aspirins over first thing in the morning , which I did . That 's all there is , there is n't any more , " concluded Alvin Cain with a wink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you came through the rear  --  directly into the kitchen ? " " That 's the ticket , friend . The Fox brothers were in here , jawing about something , and Bayard was just pouring grape juice from a full bottle into a purple glass  --  filled it right up to the top . I tossed the aspirins on the table  --  right here  --  and I said : No hard feelings , Mr. Fox . About last night , I mean , ' because the truth is I'dp103had a few beers over at the Square Grill for supper the night before and they 'd gone to my head , ha-ha !  --  and Foxy said : No , of course not . Just charge this to my account , Alvin , ' and then I left . " " Bayard Fox did n't leave the purple tumbler full of grape juice even for a moment ? Did n't turn his back oil it , for instance ? " " He could n't have . He was pouring it in while he was talking to me . When I left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " " Thanks , Mr. Cain . That 's all . " " Keep the change , old-timer . Well , Linda , I 'll be seein ' you ! Drop around sometime  --  with or without friend husband ! " And Alvin Cain left , adjusting his panama to a carefully dashing angle . " Someday  --  soon , " Davy remarked in a quiet way  --  " I 'm going to knock that hat off his head and ram it down his throat . " Ellery stood frowning for a moment . Then he said : " About those aspirins , Bayard . " The aspirins seemed to bother him . " What did happen to the bottle of ioo tablets Cain had delivered the day before ? " " I do n't know . I 'd unwrapped the package myself , and the various things in it  --  the iodine , mouth wash , aspirin , and so forth  --  I stowed away in the medicine chest in the bathroom upstairs . But that evening , when I went for the aspirins , as I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the bottle was n't there . " Ellery glanced at Chief Dakin . " I do n't recall anything in the trial transcript about a missing bottle of aspirins , Dakin . Why the omission ? " " Because it could n't have had anything to do with the death of Mrs. Fox , " retorted the policeman . " That 's why Cain 's testimony was n't admitted , either . . . about the aspirins , I mean . The phone call and the argument , of course , was . " " The autopsy revealed no unusual quantity of aspirin ? " " That 's right . " pI04 " And of course , " said Ellery fretfully , " there 's no medical connectionthat I know of between aspirin and digitalis . " He shook his head . " It 's a peculiarity , " he complained . " A loose end . Why should a fresh  --  in fact , unopened  --  bottle of too aspirins be missing ? " He had not been addressing Bayard , but it was Bayard who answered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Queen . We took it for granted that the bottle was mislaid somewhere in the house . " Ellery sighed . " Well , let 's get back to the preparation of the drink that poisoned Jessica Fox . " " Our investigation so far , " Ellery said reflectively , " has demonstratedthat the digitalis could n't have been in the bottle of grapejuiceconcentrate from which Bayard filled the purple tumbler : The quart bottle was one of six freshly delivered from Logan 's , Bayardselected it from among the six wholly at random , he uncapped it , he poured out the first tumblerful . To that point , then , the grape juice was unadulterated . But how about the tumbler itself ? " " The trial went into all that , Mr. Queen , " said Chief Dakin patiently . " But let 's follow through . Could the tumbler into which you poured the grape juice from the bottle , Bayard , have contained the poison ? " " Impossible , " said Bayard . " I 'd thoroughly rinsed the tumbler at the hot-water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Talbot , you saw your brother do that ? " Talbot Fox nodded . " Clearing the tumbler . Now . Could the water from the sink tap have been poisoned ? The water with which the glass was rinsed ? " The Chief of Police shook his head . " If you 'll recall the testimony , Mr. Queen , we 'd had the Sieglitz Laboratories analyze the water from both kitchen taps . It was also checked by the Chief Chemist of the State Water Department . Both reports gave the water  --  hot and cold  --  a clean bill . " pIO5 " All right , " nodded Ellery . " So we now have unpoisoned grape juice in an unpoisoned tumbler which was rinsed with unpoisoned city water . Bayard , what did you do next ? " " I poured the grape juice from the tumbler into the pitcher , the pitcher from the purple set . And then  --  " " Stop . Logical question : Could the pitcher have contained the poison ? " Bayard shrugged . " I 'd rinsed the pitcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass . " " I 'll testify to that , " added his brother . He grinned a little . " In fact , I did testify to it . " " So the pitcher is eliminated . Keep going , Bayard . What did you do then ? " Bayard explained with the first note of impatience he had displayedsince the investigation began . Apparently Detective Howie , who had been a sphinxian auditor of the proceedings , mistook impatience for desperation ; the fat man roused himself and jabbed Bayard 's thin shoulder with his forefinger , as if to remind him that he was a prisoner of the law and that any suspicious move would evoke instant and merciless consequences . But Bayard merely shrugged the finger off . Jessica , he said , had always preferred her grape juice diluted with water in a 50-50 ratio : half grape juice , half water . After pouring two full tumblers of grape juice into the pitcher , he had refilled the tumbler twice with cold water from the tap and poured this water into the pitcher after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold tap was also pronounced pure by the chemists , " mused Ellery , " then at this point the contents of the purple pitcher  --  half grape-juice concentrate and half cold water  --  were still unpoisoned . " But then Ellery narrowed his eyes . " No . Not necessarily . Logically the poison could still have been in that cold water . " " But I tell you the cold as well as the hot was okayed , Mr. Queen , " objected Dakin . " Nevertheless . " " How come ? "  | " The tap , Dakin . It 's an old trick  --  putting poison under the filter , say , of the tap , so that when the tap is turned on the poison is washed into the container along with the water . " But the Chief only smiled . " We did n't miss up on that one , Mr. Queen , though it 's a fact it did n't come out in the trial  --  the defense never brought it up . I had both taps taken apart and thoroughly examined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports said there had been no poison in either the hot or the cold tap , digitalis , or any other foreign substance . " Ellery made a face . " Too bad . By the way , the purple tumbler holds about a half-pint , does n't it ? " " Exactly a half-pint , Mr. Queen . " " So we now have a full quart of liquid in the pitcher  --  two tumblers , or one pint , of grape-juice concentrate and two tumblers , or one pint , of cold water  --  and all the contents have been proved free from digitalis , as well as the tumbler and pitcher themselves . What happened next , Bayard ? " " I added the ice  --  " " Ice ! " Ellery glanced swiftly at the tall refrigerator . " Ice from an automatic refrigerator ! Another old trick . The digitalis had been mixed with the water in one of the ice trays . The water froze into cubes , and when you used those cubes , Bayard , they contained the poison . Poison in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chief Dakin crushed it . " I went into that , Mr. Queen , " he said simply . " But Bayard Fox did n't use ice cubes from the electric refrigerator that mornin ' . He 'd defrosted the box the night before . " " Then where did he get the ice to put into the pitcher of grape juice , Dakin ? " demanded Ellery with a scowl . " In the summer time the Foxes used to keep an old-fashioned ice chest on the back porch there , as a sort of extra storage box for beer , watermelon , and other bulky summer items  --  most folks up here do . " The Wrightsville Ice Company  --  it 's a big outfit , Mr. Queen , absolutely reliable , got a great big modern purifying plant  --  they 'd delivered two fifty-pound cakes only the day before . You couldp107hardly say someone 'd frozen digitalis into a fifty-pound cake of ice ! " Mr. Fox chipped a piece off one of the cakes with the icepick the Company provides , ran cold water from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dropped it  --  one big chunk  --  into the pitcher . " It all came out in the trial , but for some reason or other was ordered struck out by Judge Newbold , so it does n't appear in the transcript you read . " " Eliminating the ice , " growled Ellery . " All right , Bayard , you now had the purple pitcher containing a quart of dilute grape juice and some ice  --  or rather , one chunk of ice  --  and at this point the contents of the pitcher were still pure . ' What was your next step ? " Bayard had taken a fresh glass , another of the purple iced-drink set , down from the kitchen cabinet . " Could the digitalis have been in that second glass ? " No , this tumbler too had been thoroughly rinsed by Bayard  --  " Neither Davy nor I , " Bayard smiled , " were what you 'd call expertdishwashers , and I usually rinsed everything before using it  --  during that time when Jessie was sick  --  just to make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second glass . " Ellery nodded . " It was at this point , I believe , that your brother left the house ? " " Yes . I 'd just rinsed the second glass . We 'd got to the end of our talk . Tal said something about being pretty late  --  he 'd have to be getting down to the shop  --  and I said all right , so Tal walked out of the kitchen , down the back porch , back across the two gardens to his garage , and a couple of minutes later I heard him drive out to the road and down the Hill . . . . You asked for every detail , " Bayard added , rather suddenly . It seemed a queer thing to say . And all at once an impression which had been gathering texture in Ellery 's mind was complete , to the selvage . Bayard Fox 's talk was striking , and had been striking from the first , at his brother Talbot . . . as if in Bayard 's thoughts Talbot Fox was not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was this really what Bayard was thinking , or was it a cunning attempt to project suspicion against his brother into Ellery 's brain ?  |p108And  now their interest surged back , after its natural flagging during the long interrogation , for this was the crucial episode : The husband alone in the kitchen for the first time with the pitcher of grape juice , the wife in the living room resting on the sofa , and not another soul in the house . " I carried the pitcher and glass into the living room , " said Bayardsomberly , " and I set them down on the coffee table in front of the sofa . I asked Jessie how she felt . She said fine , it was good to be downstairs . She was very nice about my having made her the grape juice . She did remark that maybe it would n't be too good for her to drink it iced  --  Dr. Willoughby was dead set against iced drinks for anybody , let alone sick patients  --  I 'd forgotten that  --  so I fished the chunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass . The ice had n't been in the pitcher more than a few minutes , so the grape juice was n't cold  --  " " Also it had n't been in long enough to have melted appreciably , " Ellery pointed out . " Meaning that there was still almost exactly one quart of liquid in the pitcher . You filled the glass after fishing the ice out of the pitcher , Bayard ? " " Not right off , no . The empty glass just stood on the coffee table , next to the pitcher , till later . " " I see . The pitcher , too , remained on the coffee table ? All the time you were in the living room with your wife ? " " Yes . " Ellery scowled , jamming his hands into his pockets . " All the materialshave been proved pure . All the containers used in the preparationof the grape juice have been proved pure as well . Yet the facts say beyond argument that the overdose of digitalis must have been taken in the grape juice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lips before she became so violently ill . Only possible conclusion : The poison must have been dropped into eitherp109the pitcher or the glass from which she drank  --  dropped in after the pitcherful was prepared . " Dakin nodded grimly . " That 's it , Mr. Queen . Now you 've got it . It was dropped in by Bayard alter Talbot left the house and  --  " " Please , Dakin . " Dakin stopped . " Let 's see if we ca n't narrow the possibilities down to either the glass or the pitcher . The testimonysaid something about the tumbler 's breaking , I believe ? " " Yes , " said Bayard . " After we 'd been sitting iii the living room a few minutes , talking , Jessie leaned over to pick up the glass so I could fill it for her . But she was still pretty weak , and the glass was heavy . It slipped out of her hand , hitting against the edge of the coffee table , and broke . " Bayard had picked up the fragments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen . Jessica went with him . " I 'm going with you , " Jessica had said . " I 'd like to see what my kitchen looks like . I can imagine the mess you and Davy have made of it , Bay ! " So husband and wife had gone from the living room to the kitchen together . And while Bayard threw the pieces of the smashed glass into the kitchen garbage pail , Jessica with her own hands took a third glass from the same iced-drink set down from the cabinet . They had walked back to the living room slowly , Jessica herself carrying the tumbler ; and then Bayard had picked the pitcher up from the coffee table and poured grape juice into the tumbler as Jessica held it out to be filled . And Jessica drank . " You were with your wife every moment from the time you first brought the grape juice into the living room ? " Ellery asked Bayardsharply . Bayard nodded . " Your wife was never alone with either the pitcher or the glass from which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen . " II0 THE MURDERER IS . A FOX " On your walk back from the kitchen , did anything happen  --  anything at all  --  that might have caused you to turn your head for a few seconds , sidetracked you ? " " No , Mr. Queen . Jessie had to take it easy , and as a matter of fact I had my arm around her waist all the way , supporting her . I did n't lose sight of that glass she was carrying for a second . " " In other words , Bayard  --  and this is tremendously important , so think carefully before answering  --  in other words , it 's your opinion that your wife could not herself have dropped the overdoseof digitalis into the pitcher , or into the glass from which she subsequently drank ? " Bayard shook his head emphatically . " It 's not a matter of ' opinion , ' Mr. Queen . She just did n't . If she had , I 'd have seen her do it . She could n't even have done it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room , or throwing the pieces into the garbage pail in the kitchen . I 'd swear to that . I did swear to it . I went through this whole business at the trial , and before the trial with my lawyer . Jessie just did n't do it herself . " " I can see why your attorney , " said Ellery through his teeth ,  --  was exasperated with you at the trial .  --  " I told the truth . I 'm still telling the truth . " " So the overdose was n't self-administered  --  Jessica did not commit suicide . " Ellery was silent . Then he tried again . " Let 's see where we stand now . We established that the digitalis must have been dropped into either the pitcher or the glass . The broken tumbler is out  --  it was never used . " Was the poison slipped into the tumbler that was used ? The only person who touched or handled that tumbler was Jessica herself , and here you are , Bayard , protesting that she could n't possibly have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So  --  the poison was n't dropped into the glass . " Then it follows that it was the pitcher into which the digitalis had been dropped  --  the pitcherful of grape juice . So when you and your wife returned from the kitchen to the living room and you filled the glass she was holding out , the grape juice in the pitcher was already poisoned . THE FOX AND THE GRAPES III " The question is : When had the digitalis been dropped into that pitcher ? One of the first things that occurred to me , Dakin , in searching for a loophole in the case against Bayard Fox , was thatthere was one interval during which the pitcher of grape juice was out of sight of Bayard . . . and of Jessica , too . During that interval , the pitcher was alone and unguarded . " " When was that ? " asked the Chief of Police quickly . " The short period , after Jessica accidentally broke the glass , during which she and Bayard went to the kitchen for another one . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the living room , alone . It was conceivable that while the loxes were in the kitchen , someone had entered the house either through the front door or one of the downstairs windows , perhaps a living-room window  --  that 's one reason I was so interested in the question of the screens , Dakin  --  and poisoned the contents of the pitcher , escaping the same way . " " Oh , that . " Dakin shook his head . " Yes , I know . I found out in reading further in the trial records . There were three witnesses to cross-testify that no one did gain entry to the house during that period : Emily Fox , who after visiting Jessica was trimming the rose bushes in her front yard , which is adjacent to the Bayard Fox front yard and one side of the house ; Hallam Luck , president of the Public Trust Company in the Square ; and Mrs. Luck . The Lucks had been driving down the Hill towards town and had stopped to chat with Emily Fox in her front garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could actually see into the living room through Jessie 's open windows as we talked . Nobody could possibly have entered her house while we were out there , either from the side visible to us , or the front . Anyway , nobody did . We saw Bayard come into the living room with the pitcher and glass , we saw Jessie drop the glass , we saw them both leave the room , and we saw them come back and Bayard pour grape juice from the pitcher on the coffee table into the glass Jessie 'd brought back with her . We even saw Jessie drink . " Emily shivered . After a moment , she continued : " Anyway , a minute or so later Mr. andp112Mrs . Luck drove on down the Hill , and I left a few minutes after that to go down to the Village to attend an Eastern Star luncheon . " Ellery looked lugubrious . " So that logical possibility was removed . I 've already spoken to Mr. and Mrs. Luck and they confirmtheir original testimony to the letter . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. and Mrs. Luck had the front and one side of the Bayard Fox house in full view , and the Bayard Foxes , from the kitchen , the rear and other side . Besides , you three  --  Emily Fox , and Mr. and Mrs. Luck  --  all swore no one did enter that living room while Bayard and Jessica were out of it . " So the grape juice in the pitcher must have been poisoned beforeBayard brought it into the living room to Jessica . " The atmosphere in the damp and dusty kitchen was thickening . Davy stood gnawing at his underlip . His father was detached and lax , that faint smile twisting his mouth . These two were looked at ; they did not look at each other . " Which brings us to the all-important question of opportunity . Who had opportunity to drop a large quantity of digitalis into that pitcher of grape juice ? " Jessica ? Bayard himself says she had no opportunity . " Emily ? " Emily gasped , stiffening in her chair . Her nearsighted brown eyes flashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellery went on calmly , " even before Bayard prepared the grape juice . In fact , before young Jackson drove up with the six bottles from Logan 's Market . " " Well , I should think so ! " snapped Emily . " Of all  --  " " Talbot Fox ? " Talbot had had time to brace himself ; he did not react visibly . " True , Talbot was present in the kitchen throughout the preparation of the grape juice , but his testimony at the trial was that he had not once been in physical contact with either the ingredients or the containers  --  had not once touched anything , or been near enough to touch anything , connected with the drink Bayard was preparing . " Ellery glanced sidewise at Bayard . " I seem to recall , Bayard , that you yourself affirmed the truth of this on the witness stand . " What would the man say ? But Bayard merely said , in a stolid way : " My brother couldn'tp113possibly have dropped the digitalis into the grape juice while we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if ever so slightly , his qualifying clause ? And yet he was eying Ellery with a deep sadness , almost a deeply bitter sadness . It was either a masterpiece of contrived expression , or the unconscious manifestation of a shocking disappointment . All mixed up . The man 's either a doubly subtle schemer or so transparent one can not see his thoughts or visualize his motives at all . Ellery gripped himself , and nodded . " No one else was involved  --  only your wife , your brother , your sister-in-law , Bayard , and yourself . Jessica , Talbot , and Emily have been exonerated on purely factual grounds . Leaving . . . yourself , Bayard . " Davy turned away , choking . And Linda , too , made a sound , but it was a sobbing sound . She tried to take her husband 's hand , but he snatched it away . " Bayard , you 're the only person in the state  --  the country  --  the Solar System , " said Ellery deliberately , " who could have poured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fox . You 're the only human being in the universe who could have poisoned her . And for confirmation : Did you have opportunity ? Decidedly you did : You were alone with the grape juice in the kitchen and on the way to the living room after your brother left the house , Bayard . " Davy looked down at his hands surreptitiously . But Ellery saw , and he saw that they were shaking , and that Davy slipped them into his trouser pockets . And Linda saw , too , and averted her eyes , looking at the wall as if it were already part of the cell she was to occupy for the rest of her life . " That 's what it all boiled down to in court twelve years ago , " said Bayard hoarsely . " I had to admit then , and I admit now , that it all sounds absolutely true  --  that I was the only one who could have poisoned the grape juice . The only thing is  --  " he laughed  --  " I did n't . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I did n't understand it then , Mr. Queen , and right now , after twelve whole years of mulling over it in a prison cell ... I still do n't understand it . " Ellery studied him with such brutal intentness that Bayard flushed and looked away . But the flush was not the flush of guilt ; it was the flush of anger . And he had turned aside as if to conceal the despair he felt his eyes must betray . At this moment Detective Howie delivered one of his rare comments . " This is stoopid . " Ellery made no reply . Chief Dakin remarked in a mild tone : " It ai n't stupid , but it 's a gosh-awful waste of time , Mr. Queen . All this was proved twelve years ago . All this was the circumstantial case against BayardFox . There was n't a cranny-hole twelve years ago , and there 's none today . " Ellery 's lips tightened . " I have to make sure in my own way , Dakin . " Afterwards , when Howie had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house next door , and Emily and Talbot Fox had followed them , in a bristling silence , Captain Fox lingered . " It was a nice try , Mr. Queen , " Davy said , wryly smiling . " Was , Davy ? " Ellery shook his head . " I 'm afraid everyone misunderstandsthe purpose of this morning 's activities . I really had no great hope of uncovering anything this morning . From reading the trial transcript it was obvious Prosecutor Tom Garback and Chief of Police Dakin had done a workmanlike job twelve years ago . This morning was a sort of warm-up , Davy . Now we know , in concrete terms , as of today , where we stand . Now we can go forward . " " Go forward to what ? " Davy was still smiling . Linda shook his arm anxiously . Ellery looked at him , and under that candid stare Davy coloredp115and looked away . " I do n't know , Davy . So far , I admit , all we seem to have done was corroborate the powerful circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you never can tell . " " Then you do n't think it 's hopeless ! " Linda cried . Ellery took her hand . " Linda , I 've found that nothing is really hopeless ' if there 's any hope concealed in it . I do n't know whether there is or not . I have n't made up my mind about a great many things in this case . Put it this way : I 'm not satisfied . " I 'm going to keep probing . I want to go over the facts again and again and again . Only when I 'm convinced beyond any possibility of logical doubt that there are no other facts in existence which can be fitted into the present structure to change its shape .. . only then will I give up and go home . " ELLERY TELEPHONED Dr. Willoughby 's office . " Could I come over to see you now , Doctor ? " " Can you make it in an hour ? " asked Dr. Willoughby . " I ought to be through with my waiting list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked thoughtful as he hung up . Dr. Willoughby had not sounded exactly enthusiastic . He wondered again what , if anything , the physician was concealing . He decided to purge his mind of the details  --  to give it a rest from its morning 's intense activity . Ellery had found this regimen helpful in the past , when a certain point had been reached and all seemed over but the technical admission of failure . He did not feel half so sanguine as his talk with Davy and Linda had con/veyed . The truth was , the case looked blacker than ever , and only the ghostly glow of a suspicion  --  it could hardly be termed a belief  --  of Bayard Fox 's truthfulness gave it any illumination whatever . And this might be  --  it probably was  --  delusion , or wishful thinking , or the result of clever histrionics . How could he be sure Davy 's father was not acting a part ? Ellery tried to shake these thoughts off as he strolled down the Hill . The afternoon was pleasant , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dappled walks . But there was no peace within him ; he could not shake the facts out of his mind . So as Ellery walked down into the town , he went over them again . He had a baffled feeling , that soon excited him : he had missed something . Something vital . Something that was there , visible yet invisible . A something that might explain everything . The feeling was so strong that he paused before the Professional Building , on the corner of Slocum and Washington , opposite Logan'sMarket , to think the whole thing through again . But the something continued to elude him . Annoyed with himself , he entered the Professional Building and took the wide wooden stairs two steps at a time to the first floor , where he found Dr. Willoughby 's shingle . He went in . The waiting room , with its ancient green overstuffed furniture and lumpy seats , its faded Currier &; Ives prints , its tatteredperiodicals , was untenanted . Dr. Willoughby , in a white office coat , was seated alone in his examining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once , brightening , and came out . " I 've sent my nurse home , Mr. Queen , " he said , shaking Ellery 's hand , " so we 've got the place to ourselves . " " You have something to tell me ! " " Well , I do n't know , " said the doctor slowly . " Come into my office . . . . I do n't know what you know and what you do n't . The reason I cleared my decks here was that I 'm not too proud of my role , ' I suppose you 'd call it , in Jessica Fox 's case . It 's worried the life out of me these twelve years . "  | " I see , " said Ellery , although he did not . " By the way , before we get off on something else : Jessica did tell you , did she not , that all she 'd had to eat or drink that morning was the single glass of grape juice Bayard poured for her ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her what she 'd had to eat , and she said : Nothing , Doctor . I was too excited to have breakfast . But I let Bayard make me some grape juice , and I had a full glass of it . ' " Ellery nodded . " There was no doubt at all , I take it , that the woman died of digitalis poisoning . " Dr. Willoughby looked uncomfortable , and Ellery sat up alertly . " Not afterward . Looking back on it , the symptoms were exact enough . But at the time . . . Anyway , Bayard had left Jessica in the house shortly after giving her the grape juice  --  he had to go somewhere  --  and when he got back a couple of hours later , he found her  --  " " Wait . " Ellery perked up again . " I 'd forgotten that . I recall now that the trial records brought it out : Bayard 's leaving the house after giving his wife the drink . A hurry call from his brother Talbot , was n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned home , about two hours later , he found Jessica vomiting . He phoned me , and I drove over immediately . " " How did you find her ? " " Wretchedly ill . Her pulse was slow . Later , it began to flutter , and on the afternoon of the following day it became very fast . She died the evening of the second day . " Dr. Willoughby pushed away from his desk and began to pace the floor of his examining room with tired steps . " I ca n't forgive myself , " he groaned . " For one whole day , Mr. Queen , I thought she 'd simply had a relapse . I ca n't forgive myself . " " Is that what 's been bothering you , Doctor ? " " Yes . " " Nothing else ? You 're not concealing something ? " " Concealing something ! " Dr. Willoughby paused in utter stupefaction.  | " Some fact you 'd become aware of , or knew from the beginning , which you failed to tell the authorities ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his big head and laughed . " So that 's what you 've been thinking ! " He wiped his eyes . " No , Mr. Queen . I have n't concealed a thing . What 's been bothering me is that I failed to recognize digitalis poisoning in time  --  that I thought she 'd simply had a relapse after her long illness . " He went on to say that other physicians later assured him he had not been careless , that the circumstances of the case justified his initial diagnosis of relapse ; but while he was talking , Ellery - reflected sourly on the death of another hope . " Good land , " Dr. Willoughby was saying heatedly , " how could I possibly have dreamed that the woman was poisoned  --  that Fox had deliberately planned to murder her with an overdose of her medicine ? And yet  --  I should have . She relied on me . She 'd put herself into my hands .... " Ellery tried to soothe the old man 's conscience . " Why , even on the morning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't suspicious . When I came to see her that morning  --  she was stricken on a Tuesday , and this was Wednesday morning  --  she seemed much stronger , and the nurse I 'd got the previous evening to take care of her in the emergency said her patient had passed a not too bad night . In fact , when I dropped in Jessica was sitting up in bed , all fixed up in a bed jacket and with a ribbon in her hair , and she was writing a letter to some friend , she felt so much better ; she even gave it to me to mail on my way out , along with a batch of envelopes she said her husband had written the night before  --  containing bills and checks , or some such household things . But that afternoon  --  about thirty hours after the drinking of the grape juice  --  she took a sudden turn , weakened rapidly , and by that time it was too late to save her . " " Is all this the usual course in digitalis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , and the autopsy findings established positively that she died of digitalis poisoning ? "  | " Well , the symptoms were significant  --  when we looked back , we realized they fitted perfectly with a diagnosis of digitalis poisoning . But we still could n't be absolutely sure , and unfortunately digitalis goes through a process of complete absorption in the body cells and is usually impossible to detect in an autopsy . However , when Chief Dakin hunted for the bottle of tincture of digitalisin the house  --  I 'd prescribed fifteen drops three times a day for a short time , but had ordered Jessica to discontinue the digitalis a couple of weeks before , because she was better  --  exactly two weeks , it was , on Memorial Day , so she had n't taken any digitalis from May thirtieth to June fourteenth  --  when Dakin looked for the bottle , as I say , and found it , instead of being nearly full as it should have been  --  it was empty ! A one-ounce bottle ! Then , of course , taking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked dissatisfied . " It 's a flabby setup , " he complained . " No p.m. findings . . . You say positive : How positive is positive , Dr. Willoughby ? " " Do n't take my word for it , " growled the old doctor , coloring . " If you read the records , you also read the testimony of half a dozen medical men besides myself  --  including Jonas Hefflinger , the toxicologist . They agreed unanimously that Mrs. Fox died of digitalispoisoning , basing their opinion on the hour-to-hour symptoms and the surrounding circumstances . " Ellery sat plunged in thought for some time . Then he looked up with a glitter in his eyes . " Dr. Willoughby , " he said , " is there a possibility Jessica Fox was poisoned after she became so ill ? That her vomiting and so on were a reaction to simple relapse , as you first thought , but that her death the evening following was caused by an overdose of digitalis administered to her in something she ate or drank after you took charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There was a time , Mr. Queen , when I 'd have been overjoyed to embrace that theory . But the facts deny it absolutely . " In the first place , I took care of Jessica personally as soon as I was called in , neither Bayard Fox nor anyone else close to her coming near her . I spent the entire remainder of that first day  --   |p120Tuesday   --  with her , and for Tuesday night and Wednesday I got a trained nurse I trusted  --  and still trust  --  implicitly . Helen Zimbruskihas worked with me for twenty-five years , Mr. Queen , and I 've never known her to be careless on a case . " In the second place , Jessica was given virtually nothing to eat and very little liquid after her vomiting spell ; she could n't retain . We fed her just enough to keep up her strength . Nothing passed her lips till she died that was n't prepared by my nurse and immediatelyfed to the patient by her , with tested ingredients out of sterilized implements . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grape juice her husband had prepared for her the previous morning  --  Tuesday morning . You can take that as gos-pel . " Ellery rose . " Mind if I use your phone , Doctor ? " he asked . " Help yourself . " Ellery telephoned to Chief of Police Dakin . " Washout with Dr. Willoughby , " he reported . " I could have told you that beforehand , " grunted the Chief . " So now what , Mr. Queen ? " " Dakin , " said Ellery truthfully , " I 'm damned if I know . "  |p121SUNLESS  DAY TURNED moonless night . The bluster of the afternoon fell away , leaving Wrightsville still . It was as if everything had died in concert  --  sun , moon , wind , and the hopes of the Foxes . Ellery could only sit in silence in the swelter , keeping his eye on them . It was not pretty . Linda was trussed in an agony . The relief of giving way was denied her ; she denied it to herself . She moved through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a current . Ellery perceived what an effort it cost her to move so , to keep from striking out with a shriek . This distraction of selfdisciplinewas all for Davy , and Davy was blind to it . He had sunk into his despair , the kind of despair which , unable to rebel , can only accept . He too moved through the evening , barely pushing himself about , the embodiment of a weariness which required no outlet , since it had nothing to give vent to . Davy was an empty man this evening  --  emptied even of Linda . As for the Talbot Foxes , the long years stood between them . Talbot was mute because he was humble , Emily because she was proud . Each flick and click of her knitting needles threw off pride like sparks ; she sat absorbed in her work as if content to let the steel speak for her . And it spoke a language her husband understoodwithout difficulty , for as the woolen garment grew Talbot'sp122humility grew with it , until at last he was an abject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Emily and Talbot held a long conversation that night without either so much as breathing loudly . It 's because she exposed herself to him today , thought Ellery . While the secret of Talbot 's relationship with dead Jessica was locked up in Emily 's mind , she could play the mousy put-upon wife with equanimity ; but now that he knows she has known all these years she must play herself , the woman scorned  --  must pay Talbot back , for he expects it ; indeed , she expects it of herself . Ellery wondered what was really going on in the brain that directedthose jabbing hands . But this was barren speculation ; it advanced the cause of Davy and Linda Fox not at all . What Emily was thinking would henceforthremain with Emily . She was the kind of woman , Ellery felt sure , who does not repeat a mistake . He turned to an inspection of Bayard Fox . Here was the blackest enigma of them all . What was Bayard thinking ? Of his prison cell , and its protecting walls ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free man ? Or of shrewder matters ? That Egyptian physiognomy told nothing . There was a touch of resignation in the relaxation of the spare old body , but that would be natural in a man whose rebellion had spent itself ten years before . Outwardly , Bayard was the least disturbed of any . 3There was no point in studying Detective Howie . That fat immensitywas as primitive as a boulder . His job was to sit upon a convicted murderer ; and Detective Howie sat , fatly . When they had all gone to bed , Ellery went out to the dark . porch and lay down on the slide-swing , a pillow punched under his neck and one foot dangling . The leaves of the apple and chestnuttrees beyond were splashes of fixed black paint  --  irritatingly unnatural ; there was no comfort in the stars , either , for they were sultry-looking . They made him uneasy. pI23The whole world seemed queer tonight . Ellery let his mind go , as if it were a trusted horse he was riding on a treacherous night mountainside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumbled afghan and a kitchen full of frozen memories . It stumbled over six bottles of grape juice , and stumbled again . Irrelevancies and fantasies cluttered the path of his wandering . Ellery fell asleep . There is a neutral ground between the dark land of sleep and the realm of wakefulness where the ghostly folk of dreams fill out a little and the real world thins , until the two all but make a union . Jessica Fox was crossing the lawn of the Talbot Fox grounds . Ellery could not see the lower part of her body , for it was cut off from his view by the porch railing ; but her torso was clad in a bed jacket , she wore a ribbon in her hair , and her face was wrapped in a thick purple veil appliqued with purple silk bunches of grapes . He could make out the conformation of her face , but not her features . He strained and strained to penetrate the veil , but could not . He knew she was a dream he was dreaming . Yet there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Bayard Fox house dimly beyond , there was the Bayard Fox house  --  there , even , were the sullen stars ; they were all real enough , if a little flat and wavery . The dream-Jessica was treading on real grass and making her way to the real house in which she had died in the pain of poison . Ellery watched her undulant progress across the lawns in a disembodied fascination . Jessica reached the lawn of her own house and moved toward one of her front windows ; and this was strange , for when she reached it the window offered no impediment to her body ; neither window nor wall stopped her ; she melted through them . And now Ellery could not see her  --  which was unlike a dream ; but he could make out a sort of glow she gave forth , a luminescence ,  | like a halo or an aura , as she moved about the living room in which she had drained a glass of grape juice twelve years before . The glow was not steady ; it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more  --  almost as if she were a firefly trapped in a room . The glow of Jessica blinked on and off , here and there , in the living room of her house , and Ellery lay on the swing next door , in the neutral land , watching it . How long he watched he could not have said ; there is no time in that half-world . But for the timeless duration of that firefly phenomenon Ellery struggled within himself to step across the border into the land of consciousness . Something warned him to do so . Something drove him to do so . And as he struggled he gradually became conscious of real things : the faintest creak of the swing , the slightest sigh of a tree  --  there was a breeze again , he thought  --  the hot wetness of the pillow beneath his nape , an uncomfortable stiffness in one leg . . . the busy little tick of a watch . And suddenly he was across . His left hand was under his left cheek , and the wrist watch on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The radial hands stood coldly at a quarter past three . Funny dream , Ellery thought . He straightened his leg , which had fallen asleep . Yawning , he looked over at the house next door . For an instant  --  one of the few such instances in his lifetime  --  his heart jumped with irrational terror . The glow of Jessica Fox was still flitting about that dark and silent room . Ellery sat up quickly . Ghosts there might be , and the dead may revisit their earthly domiciles ; but no ghost Ellery had ever heard of carried a flashlighton such excursions . Someone had broken into the Bayard Fox house while he slept , someone most assuredly not Jessica Fox.  |p125Ellery  tore at the laces of his shoes , ripped his shoes off , dropped them on the swing , and sprang . His stockinged feet made no sound as he raced across the two lawns toward the other house . It occurred to him as he ran that the housebreaker could not have been inside for very long . Some sound made by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prowler stole past the area just below the porch ; in those few moments of semi-wakefulness , his eyes bewitched by sleep , Ellery had dreamed a dream of Jessica Fox . But it had been the solid prowler he had seen stealing across the lawns , not the figment of his dream . He had actually witnessed the woman  --  or the man  --  forcing one of the downstairs living-room windows of the Bayard Fox house and climbing in , although his dream-drugged eyes had transformed the figure and its entry in the magical manner of all dream-action . There was no time for reflection . Ellery knew but one thing as he sped toward the open window : he must see the face of the man or woman who was prowling about the interior of Bayard Fox 's house . He even felt a surge of exultancy . He could not define it ; it was only as if a great stroke of luck had flashed in his path , like lightning . It was as if this , in a queer way , were the very end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he would see the face of the person who held the flashlight . But just as Ellery reached the window , the light went out . He remained where he was , in a crouch , fingers touching the sill , eyes barely clearing it for a view of the dark interior . He had merely to wait where he was . In a moment the light would flash on again . It had kept up this on-and-off operation for some minutes now . There was no reason to believe it would not continue . There ! But the leap of elation died as it was born . The light had flashed again , but this time it was not in the living room . Ellery saw its dim reflection on the slim sliver of foyer-wall visible to himp126from the angle made by his position at the living-room window . The intruder had gone into the foyer . Another flash ! But even dimmer this time . So he was on his way to the rear of the house . Ellery waited . He waited and waited . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was reasonable to assume that the intruder had entered some room at the rear of the house . The kitchen ? It was possible . In fact , Ellery knew of no other room that might have been the housebreaker 's objective . He cursed his carelessness in not having familiarized himself fully with the house during the day . Except for the kitchen , hall , and the living room he had no idea of the lower-floor layout . It could not be the dining room . Dining rooms usually lie i directly across a foyer from living rooms . But the light had come from farther down the hall . Which room could lie back there if it was not the kitchen the prowler had made for ? A maid 's room , possibly . Or a study . Ellery dismissed these speculations . The question was what to do . Go in after his quarry ? But then he would have to make his way across a pitch-dark room into an equally dark foyer with whose plan he was all too unfamiliar . He would probably bump into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape through the rear . Then should he remain where he was , trusting that the man or woman would quit the house by the same window used in entering it ? This seemed likely , and Ellery had already settled down to waiting when it occurred to him that he was missing the whole point . Why had the prowler broken into the Bayard Fox house ? At all ? He decided to go in . He got through the open window without noise , froze for a moment to catch his breath , orient himself.  |p127And  as he crouched there , at the living-room window , he heard a slight sound from the rear of the house . Like the opening of a drawer . Again ! The intruder was opening drawers , closing them , opening others . Looking for something , then . Looking for something ! Ellery began to grope in the general direction of the archway to the foyer . He moved stooped over , hands extended , trying to cross the living room quickly and still without sound . Halfway across the room his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slight thud . He stopped at once , listening , tingling , feeling for the thing he had bumped into . It was the coffee table . ... He waited . No harm done . Another drawer opened and in a few seconds slid shut . Ellery got to the archway without further incident . Here he paused again , peering down the hall . The faintest glow came from what seemed an open doorway at the end of it , a doorway not across the line of his vision but edgewise to it . But the kitchen was on the other side . So the prowler was in a maid 's room , or a study . And now he was not flashing the light intermittently ; he kept it on as he searched through drawers . Ellery made his way down the hall on the balls of his stockinged feet . The house had stood unheated during twelve winters , and dampness had warped the floors  --  he recalled how badly they had creaked during the day . So he was doubly careful , testing each board before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the hall toward the source of that faint light . When he was three-quarters toward his goal , a loud sound came from the unidentified room . It was a splintery snap of a sound , like the cracking of wood . And immediately the sound of another drawer jerked open . And then a hiss , which might have been the intake of a triumphant breath.  |p128The  light vanished , leaving blackest blackness . Ellery wasted no time bemoaning his luck . He negotiated the remaining distance in two long strides , risking a protesting board . But he reached the invisible doorway without having stepped on one . At once he raised his arms high and grasped both jambs , his body squarely in the middle of the open doorway . Now , he thought grimly , let Mr. or Mrs. or Miss Prowler come out . The intruder ca n't possibly know I 'm here . There 's no reason for him  --  or her  --  to leave by a window of this room . The only sound I made was in the living room , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And my breathing is inaudible , unlessthe creature in that room has the ears of a fox  --  Ellery barely had time to complete the thought . The front of his head seemed to rip away . As the pain flashed through his brain and down into his body , as he felt his knees sag and his arms drop from the jambs , his falling left arm passed before his eyes . And he saw his wrist watch with the hands standing at 3:26 . Saw the time in the darkness and realized that what he could see was also visible to another . He had forgotten that his watch had radial hands . His arm had been on the jamb , outstretched , his cuff had fallen away exposing his wrist , and the man or woman in the room had spied the luminousdial . He always wore his watch with the face turned inward . Serves you right , his-brain was saying as he went down . A reflex caused him to twist his head far to one side . Another blow struck the side of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt no further sensations , not even the foot that trampled on his hand in the dark . Nor did he hear the clatter of his assailant 's escape up the hall . Ellery opened his eyes in the middle of a firmament gone crazy with suns and comets , all different-colored and all in violent motion . For a while he had the feeling that he was floating in black space , surrounded by the galaxy.  |p129But  then he realized that he was lying across the sill of the still-unidentified room in Bayard Fox 's house , in the same darkness . He blinked the colored spots away as he struggled to sit up . Returning consciousness made him aware of his head and shoulder and hand . The top of his head was burning , his left shoulder was boiling with pain , and his left hand felt crippled . Sitting on the floor , he shook his head slowly , trying to clear it , fumbling meanwhile for a packet of matches in his jacket pocket . But he could not find it , so he peered blearily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to focus sufficiently to make out the time . It was 3:44 . Out eighteen minutes ! Groaning , he rolled over , got to his knees , and finally , clutching at the nearer jamb , pulled himself to his feet . No point in being careful now , he thought wryly . The mysterious prowler had long since gone . Should have had the electricity turned on for the investigation , he thought as he stumbled up the hall . He blundered across the living room and dropped out the stillopenwindow . His head was rocking with pain , as were his shoulder and hand . He plodded across the Bayard Fox lawn toward Talbot'shouse , fighting nausea . It was quiet and dark and hot outside . Nothing seemed different . On Talbot 's porch Ellery paused . Talbot 's house seemed still asleep . After a while Ellery went in . The telephone was in the downstairs hall , near the front door , on a skimpy little table . Ellery sat down slowly in the tiny telephone-table chair . A nightlightburned on the wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His left hand was swollen and discolored ; there was a trace of dried blood across the puffed knuckles . In the mirror above the table he could glimpse his forehead . At the hairline an area the size and shape of a lead sinker rose nobly . The tissue there was bloated and purplish . In one place the lump was cracked in a blood-line . At the side of his head another lump rose . His shoulder throbbed . But Ellery stared at his injuries in a vast excitement . They tell a story ! he thought . An impossible , wonderful story . He felt like laughing aloud . He took the phone carefully , dialed the operator . " Get me Chief of Police Dakin at his home , " he said , his lips to the mouthpiece . " This is urgent . " " Shall I call you back , sir ? " " I 'll hold on . " At the fourth buzz Dakin 's voice , calmly reassuring , answered . " This is Queen . " " What 's the matter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the Bayard Fox house . " " Sure . " " Quietly . " " Sure . " Ellery hung up . He felt his shoulder , winced , and glanced up the stairs . The house was still . Painfully he went upstairs , blessing the padded stair-carpeting . Along the upper hall he sought a certain door , but before he knocked he paused to listen . Nothing . He knocked , softly . He heard the smothered wheeze as Detective Howie awoke , the sleepy grunt of Bayard Fox , a groaning of old bedsprings , and in a few moments Howie unlocked the door . " Yeah ? " The Prosecutor 's man looked startled . " Let me in , Howie . " Ellery quietly shut the door . Howie had snapped on the bedlight , and Bayard Fox was up on his elbow , his thin white hair standing all over his head , staring . " For heaven 's sake , Mr. Queen , " gasped Davy 's father , " what 's happened to you ? "  | " Please keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You look like you run into something , friend . " Howie was in one-piece underwear , fatter and unlovelier than ever . He , too , was staring at Ellery 's head . " I have n't much time , " snapped Ellery . " Howie , has Bayard Fox left this room tonight ? " " Huh ? " " Shut your silly mouth and concentrate , Howie . Is there any way your prisoner could have got out of this room tonight withoutyour knowing ? " The stupid expression on the fat detective 's face vanished in a savage grin . He trod heavily over to the double bed and ripped the topsheet away . " What do you think ? " he screeked . I do n't believe you 'd be grinning , my friend , thought Ellery , if you knew the significance of your little mean triumph . Not you . A short length of picture wire was securely twisted about BayardFox 's left big toe . " I 'm a light sleeper , " leered Detective Howie . " But when I 'm on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , sir . The other end winds around my ankle . Every time he moves I wake up , but then I go to sleep again . " " I could get out of it if I wanted to , " said Bayard Fox with a little spate of hatred . " Try it sometime , Fox . " " Suppose he could . It 's possible , " argued Ellery , his eyes bright . " It ai n't . " " But suppose it was . " " I keep the door locked . " " Doors can be unlocked . " " Not without a key . I got the key on a chain around my wrist . " Detective Howie showed his bad teeth in another grin . " I mean not amatchoors like Foxy here . " " Then there 's the window , " objected Ellery . " Take a look at it , friend . " Ellery crossed the room . The lower part of the window was open about six inches . Ellery tried to raise it . It would not budge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of homemadewedges , the window had been rendered immovable . " He could get it open , " chuckled Detective Howie , " enough to wriggle out , maybe , but not without workin ' on it for a long time , Queen , and not without me hearin ' him . . . Makes it stuffy in here , " he said slyly , " but I guess if I can stand it , he can . " " You 're a careful operative , " drawled Ellery . " You said it . " " Suppose he hit you on the skull , Howie . Then it would n't matter how much noise he made , or how long he took getting out . " The fat lips drew back in a snarl . " Well , he did n't hit me on the skull and he better not try . . . . Say ! " Howie 's little eyes grew round . " You were hit on the skull tonight ! " " Now you 're getting it , " said Ellery . " Then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Bayard Fox did n't leave this room tonight ? " Detective Howie nodded , his grin gone . " Get dressed , Howie . Put the light out . Open the door . And listen . I do n't want anyone leaving this house for the next couple of hours . You might sit out in the hall , at the top of the stairs . Then nobody could slip down  --  or up  --  in the dark . " The fat man nodded again , dumbly . " What 's happened , Mr. Queen ? " asked Bayard Fox in a quiet voice . " I do n't know , Bayard , " said Ellery , " but I have an idea that  --  whatever it was  --  it 's a very good thing for you . " It was ten minutes past four by Ellery 's watch when the plain black sedan Chief Dakin ran slipped up the Hill and stopped beforeBayard Fox 's house . Dakin came softly up the walk and Ellery rose from the bottom step of the small porch to greet him.  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric torch . " " Let 's go in . " They spoke in low tones . When they got inside , Chief Dakin unlocking the front door with the key he had appropriated during the day from Emily Fox , the Chief switched on his torch . " Jeeps ! " he exclaimed . " What happened to you ? " Ellery told him . The Chief 's long jaw kept dropping . " But who ? " " I have no idea . Except that it was n't Bayard Fox . Howie swears Bayard did n't leave his room tonight . " " Was it somebody else from the Talbot Fox house ? " " May have been . " " Or an outsider ? " " Possibly . " " Ca n't you remember the exact place this figure come from , Mr. Queen ? You say you were half-awake  --  " " Which also means half-asleep , Dakin . No . If it was someonefrom Talbot 's house , that person may have come from the side door , gone round the house , and past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's even conceivable that he may have slipped out the front door past me , but that I did n't become conscious of his presence until he was down on the grass . Or , as I say , it may have been someone else entirely , coming from the Hill road and cutting across the Talbot Fox property to get to this one . " " A sneak thief , Mr. Queen ? " " I do n't think so , " said Ellery slowly . " No , indeed . " " You do n't know what was taken ? " " I do n't know that anything was taken . I have n't looked . I 've been waiting out there for you . I wanted an official witness to what I saw . " " Let 's take a peep at the window first . " " By all means . " They went outside again , Dakin snapping off his torch , andp134walked over to the window through which the housebreaker had gained entrance . Dakin swept the light over the grass below the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he muttered . " Ca n't even tell if it was a man or a female . " " And I did a bit of tromping myself , Dakin . I did n't think he 'd get away . I 'm getting old , Dakin , old . " " It was n't your fault , " the Chief consoled him . He examined the side of the house from the grass to the window sill . There were several dirty streaks on the paint . " Heels sliding . " Ellery nodded . " On the way out . " " Look like rubber to you , Mr. Queen ? " " It 's hard to say . " " Do to me . " " Women wear rubber heels , too , " Ellery pointed out . Dakin swore . " Give me a boost up . " Ellery caged his hands , and Dakin stepped hard . A sword tore through Ellery 's left hand , and he closed his eyes . " Take a look at the catch while you 're up there , " said Ellery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forced . With a big heavy screwdriver , maybe . Or a heavy chisel . " " You 'd relocked the windows after our session during the day ? " " Yep . I did n't close the shutters , though . " " I know that . " Dakin ran the light slowly over the window sill . " Not a thing here , " he grunted , jumping down . Ellery opened his eyes . " I thought maybe a thread or something caught on the sill . Would show if it was from a woman 's dress or a man 's suit . But there 's nothin ' I can see . Wish I had fingerprint equipment , darn it . " " I doubt very much that fingerprint equipment would do us any good , Dakin . " " Gloves ? " " Seems likely . The whole thing had a technique . " " Professional , hey ? "  | " No . But a technique just the same . " " Too many people read detective stories , " growled Chief Dakin . " Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They re-entered the house by the front door . " Living room first , " murmured Ellery . " It 's where my friend with the blunt instrument started . " Only two things had been touched , so far as they could determine . One was a large breakfront , a glittery mahogany piece . The lid of the secretary in the piece had been pulled down and its contents strewn over the floor . The cabinets on each side of the breakfront had also been pulled open . The other disturbed object was a drum-table which stood against a wall , a lamp and an ashtray upon it . The small drawer had been jerked open and its contents , too , chiefly old bills , had been jumbled and scattered . " We 'd never be able to tell if he took anything , " complained Dakin . " Everything 's in such a mortal mess . And it 's been twelve years since anybody looked into these things . " " It 's reasonable to assume he did n't . Because he was n't through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall to the rear of the house  --  to that other room there . " " He was lookin ' for something , all righty . " " He did n't find it in here , Dakin , I 'm pretty sure . " They walked down the hall from the foyer slowly , Dakin wieldingthe beam of his torch like a broom . " The so-and-so was mighty careful not to drop anything , " grunted the Chief . " So-and-so 's usually are , Dakin . " And there was the doorway . " This the place where he slugged you ? " " Yes . " " Why , that 's Bayard Fox 's old den in there . " " Den ? " " His whatchamacallit  --  his study . " " Oh , " said Ellery . They went in.  | It was a tiny room paneled in pickled pine , with built-in pine bookshelves and a small marble-manteled fireplace at the far side . A scarred walnut flat-top desk made the room look even tinier . Its drawers had all been pulled out and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heap . " He did n't have to force the locks on these desk drawers , " murmuredEllery , examining them . " They were n't locked . " " Look at these smudges in the dust ! " " I 've seen them . He did wear gloves , Dakin . Naked fingers would have left a distinguishable print , or part of a print , somewhere , even to the unaided eye . " " What else ? " muttered Dakin , glancing around sourly . " That secretary against the wall . " It was an old piece , an antique , of pine with a fine patina . It had three drawers below the lid . The lowest and middle drawers were pulled three-quarters open and the familiar mess had been made out of their contents . But the topmost drawer , which was open less than halfway , was empty . " That 's what I thought , " said Ellery sharply , more to himself than to Dakin . He knelt on the dusty rug , carefully scrutinizing the lock of the empty drawer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forced , Mr. Queen . Fresh jimmy-marks around the lock . " " Yes . Notice that the other two drawers show no marks of forcing about the locks at all . So those drawers were n't locked . But this top drawer was , and the intruder forced it with the same tool he used on the window  --  I heard the crackle and snap from the hall just before I reached the doorway . Incidentally , he must have hit me with the handle of that tool . " His head was paining him again . In the excitement of the hunt , he had forgotten . Now , it was coming back . " Do you suppose he found anything in that top drawer , Mr. Queen ? " " Of course , Dakin . "  | " But how can you be sure ? " " People do n't lock empty drawers . " " Now that 's a fact ! But what was locked in this drawer , Mr. Queen ? What was it this crook swiped tonight ? " " If we knew that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throb in his head and shoulder and hand , " we might know a great deal . " " Well , all we have to do is ask Bayard Fox ! This was his den . " " Yes . Let 's go ask Bayard what he kept in this drawer . " THEY FOUND DETECTIVE HOWIE sitting on the first-floor landing with his back set against the wall and his enormous bare feet propped against the newel post . He had slipped his pants on over his underwear . In the rays of the Chief 's torch the fat man 's face was moist and baleful . He looked exactly as if he had been cheated out of something . " Anything ? " Ellery whispered . The detective shook his head , scowling . " Where 's Bayard Fox ? " demanded Dakin . " Where do you think he is ? " " Stay right here , Howie , " said Ellery . The blubberlips stretched in a snarl . " I do n't have to take your orders ! " " Would you please stay right here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not move . So they stepped over his legs and went quickly down the hall to the " south " room.  | Bayard was lying on his back in the old-fashioned iron double bed , smoking a cigaret . He sat up at once , tamping the butt out in an ashtray on the nighttablebeside his bed . Dakin shut the door . " What 's happened , Mr. Queen ? I 've been lying here worried to death . " " Somebody broke into your house tonight , Bayard , and stole something . " " Broke in ? Stole something ? " There was no mistaking the genuineness of his incredulity . " I have various lumps and bruises in proof , " said Ellery . " Here  --  I 'd better sit down . " " But  --  who , Mr. Queen ? " " I did n't see , and I do n't know . " " What was stolen ? " " We do n't know that either , " said Chief Dakin . " We thought you could tell us , Mr. Fox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You mean you think  --  " " No , no , Mr. Fox . You ai n't involved ; Howie cleared you . I meant maybe you can remember what was in the drawer . " " Which drawer , Mr. Dakin ? " " There 's an old pine secretary in your den . Somethin ' was taken out of one of the three drawers in the secretary . " " My secretary ? " Bayard 's lips twisted . " An antique . . . Jessica picked it up at Creecher 's Barn over towards Connhaven . Not long after we were married . She . . . gave it to me . As a birthday present . " " Fine , " said Dakin patiently . " But about the drawer  --  " " You 'd locked one of those drawers , Bayard , " said Ellery . " The top one of the three . " " Locked ? " Bayard frowned . " Did n't you ? " " I  --  I guess I do n't remember . " " Try , Bayard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , painfully . After a while he said , shaking his head : " I seem to recall that I used to keep some drawer or other for special things .... It 's all so fuzzy . " " What kind of things , Mr. Fox ? " demanded Dakin . But Bayard shook his head again . " It 's been twelve years , a long twelve years , " he muttered . " I just ca n't remember . " " Could it have been something of value , Bayard ? " asked Ellery . " Silver , or cash , or anything like that ? " " Well , we had a special silver chest , but Emily 's been keeping that , and I think she 's given it to Linda for Linda 's and Davy 's home . And I never kept cash anywhere but in my wallet , Mr. Queen  --  " " Jewelry ? " " The few things Jessica had she kept in a box in our bedroom . Nothing of any importance . The only really valuable thing she had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " " Could it have been anything else of Jessica 's ? " " I do n't see how it could have been , " frowned Bayard . " Jessie always used to say a man 's den was his castle . That was my room , for my things . " Ellery and Chief Dakin looked at each other . " Well , Bayard , if you should happen to remember , let me know right away . " " Of course . But what do you suppose it means , and who could have taken it  --  whatever it was ? " But Ellery shook his head and , followed by Dakin , left Bayard 's room . Chief Dakin relieved Detective Howie at the landing , and the fat man slap-slapped back to the bedroom looking sullen . " You stay here , Dakin , " whispered Ellery . " I 'll begin with Linda upstairs . " Ellery went up to the " apartment " on the top floor . He was about to knock on the door of the bedroom Linda had until recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ear to it instead . Linda was crying . Ellery frowned . But then he knocked . The crying stopped immediately . " Yes ? " Her voice was shaky . " Ellery Queen , Linda . Might I see you ? " He heard her get out of bed . At least two minutes elapsed before Linda opened the door wide . Her face was freshly powdered and there was no trace of tears . She had thrown a negligee over her nightgown , and she looked frightened . " What 's the matter , Mr. Queen ? What time is it  --  Oh ! Your head ! " " I 'll explain later , Linda . " There was no one else in the room . " Would you come down to the parlor in five minutes ? " " Of course . . . " Her twin bed was rumpled , mauled . " In five minutes , Linda . " He went back downstairs and shrugged at Dakin on the landingand strode over to the door of the bedroom Davy was occupying . He turned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " old " bedroom , the room she had occupied from childhood until her marriage . It was a feminine , pretty room , with tester bed and frilly curtains and silk lamp shades and a kidneyshapedvanity with an organdie skirt . Davy looked uncomfortable and out of place there , even in sleep . The boy was curled up in a tangle of arms and legs , breathing noisily . " Davy . " He awoke instantly . He was really asleep , Ellery thought . If he 'd been shamming , the waking-up process would have been elaborate and slow . " Linda ! Something 's  --  " " No , no , Davy . " Ellery sat down on the edge of the bed . A pearly cast was coming over the darkness ; in it Davy 's angular face floated pallidly . " What happened to your face ? "  |p141Ellery  told him . Davy was silent . But then he said : " Here , let me fix that head of yours up . And I 'll see what I can do with your hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks . Tell me  --  do you walk in your sleep ? " " Huh ? " Davy 's eyes narrowed . " Say , what arc you trying to make me out , a Jekyll and Hyde ? " " Now , now , " grinned Ellery , " keep your head , Captain . I 've got to eliminate you , too , you see . And 1 thought your recent nervous state  --  " " Oh . Sorry . " Davy shivered in the pearly light . " But that ca n't be . There 's never been a trace of that . " " It was the wildest conjecture , " nodded Ellery . " You heard nothing , eh , Davy ? " " Not a thing . I was absolutely pooped last night . Flopped into bed here and just went out . " " Do you have any recollection of what your father used to keep in that secretary drawer ? " " I did n't know he kept ' anything . I was n't allowed in Dad 's den when I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd only mess it up . I guess I was kind of a trial to Mom . . . . Do n't forget , I was only ten or so . " " No idea what it might have been ? " " Not the remotest . I ca n't figure this , Mr. Queen . What 's it mean ? " But Ellery merely said : " Throw something on and go downstairs , Davy . " When Ellery went back into the hall he found Chief Dakin in low-voiced conversation with Talbot Fox . Talbot 's hair was disheveled , and under a shabby bathrobe he wore pajamas . There were carpet-slippers on his bare feet . " I 've just told Mr. Fox , " said Dakin as Ellery joined them , " and he 's just as puzzled as we are . "  | " It does n't make sense , Mr. Queen . " Talbot seemed excessively worried . " It will , Talbot , " murmured Ellery . " Is your wife awake ? " " Emily ? I do n't know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scowled down at his slippers , his hands making bulges in the pockets of his bathrobe . " I . . . slept in Davy 's old room last night , " he muttered . " Oh , I see . " Talbot seemed to feel further explanation was necessary . " Emily did n't . . . feel well . " " I 'm sorry to hear that . Do you suppose she 's well enough to get up and come downstairs ? " " I 'll see . " Talbot shuffled up the hall to the master bedroom . Before the door he hesitated . Then , timidly , he knocked . After a few moments he knocked again . He knocked six times before Emily unlocked her door . " So nobody has any idea what was stolen from Bayard 's secretarydrawer , " said Ellery cheerfully in the parlor . They were all shivering in an unexpectedly chill dawn . The conference had been unproductive . Emily merely compressed her lips when she was asked , as if the very question were an impertinence . Linda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Davy had already said he did not . That left Talbot .. . and they had all looked at Talbot . It was impossible to forget that Talbot and Jessica . . . A secret relationship begat secrets . Was the secret of the locked drawer and its stolen contents somehow tied up to the Talbot-Jessica affair ? The question was in all their eyes , not excluding Ellery 's . But Talbot simply said : " I have n't a Chinaman 's notion of what was in that drawer . How should I have ? " And Emily sniffed , pointedly.  | " This , " said Chief Dakin , " is gettin ' us nowhere . " " On the contrary , Dakin . It 's a vastly important development . The first real ray of hope I 've seen since I got going on the case . " " Hope ? " Linda uttered the word as if she had never known its meaning before . " Well , tell us more , Mr. Queen . Do n't stop there ! " Ellery shrugged . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , which has been shut up for a dozen years  --  and shunned during all that time as if it were a pest-house !  --  and ransacked the living room and Bayard 's old den . In a locked drawer of Bayard 's secretary  --  a drawer , so far as we can determine , locked twelve or more years ago  --  this unknown housebreakerfound what he was looking for . For he took it with him in his flight . " Ellery sucked his lower lip , frowning . " To conclude that our housebreaker was a professional thief would be an error . For a dozen years no one , thief or honest man , has set foot in that house . Yet the very night of the day in which I began a reinvestigation of the case , the house is entered . I do n't believe in such striking coincidences . " I think we may reasonably conclude this :  --  " That the theft is connected with the Jessica Fox murder case . " That the stolen object is a significant factor of the case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a convicted murderer , while the case was a dead issue , the object locked in that drawer had no value and no importance for the thief . Today the situation is suddenly different . Today a man is on the scene , a stranger to Wrightsville , who has brought Bayard Fox back , who has entered the deserted house , who has asked old questions there . . . who has reopened the entire case . Instantly our mysterious figure springs into action . He seizes his very first opportunity to take possession of the object in that drawer . Why should he execute this hasty and , dangerous maneuver ? It can only be because he 's afraid I would have found that object . But why should he be afraid of that ? Well , what is it I 'm trying to accomplish here ? I 'm trying to clear Bay/and Fox of the twelve-year-old murder . Then he knows that object  --  in my hands , or in the hands of the authorities  --  will help clear Bayard Fox . " Do n't you see ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence which might have cleared Bayard of the murder charge twelve years ago ! Now do you see why I 'm hopeful ? " They saw . " Dakin , you and I have a real job on our hands . For the first time in the case . " Chief Dakin was looking wobbly . " We 've got to identify the dark figure of my assailant  --  I 'm almost tempted to say the fox ' !  --  who 's been lurking safely in the background all these years and who 's now been forced into the open by my coming to Wrightsville . " We 've got to find out who that person is , and  --  equally imperative , Dakin  --  we 've got to find out what it was he lifted to-night . " Dakin nodded , swallowing . " You folks better not say anything about what happened tonight . To anybody . " They saw that , too . A new feeling of solidarity seemed to have drawn them close together . There was an excitement about them , a pleasure which they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time they took Bayard to themselves , a Bayard whose thin face was transfigured by an incredulous joy . " And now , " said Ellery with a smile , " I 'll have to ask you not to leave the house until Dakin and I have had a chance to look things over outside . " It was too cosy . Where was the one face , the one expression , of fear ? It was not there . In dismal fact , Ellery reflected , as they left in a group , talking excitedly , the only one who seemed personally affected by the revelation was Detective Howie.  |p145AS  SOON AS THERE WAS light enough to see by , Ellery and Chief Dakin went outside . They examined the lawn , beginning in the area just below the Talbot Fox porch , as closely as if they were hunting lost diamonds . Not an inch of the drought-browned grass escaped their scrutiny . They worked in short circling movements , one behind the other , stooped over and silent . But when at last they straightened , having gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only he 'd dropped something , or there 'd been enough of a rain to soften up this sod , " complained Dakin . " Well , he did n't , and there was n't , " replied Ellery . " Let 's try the road . " They examined the tarred road for several hundred yards down the Hill on the theory that the thief , if he were an outsider , had driven up from town and parked his car well away from the Fox properties . But this search , too , yielded nothing . " It 's going to be a toughie , Dakin , " remarked Ellery as they strode back toward Bayard Fox 's house . " Maybe impossible . " " Let 's tackle the interior again , " said Ellery , making a face . " But this time as if we meant it . " It took them two hours to go over the ground floor of the untenantedhouse . At the end all they had to show for their exertions was a long heavy screwdriver , which Ellery nosed out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in his getaway after boppin ' you , " said Chief Dakin , handling it gingerly . " It rolled under the table . " " Do you suppose we could trace this , Dakin ? " " Not a chance . Look . " Dakin pointed out the maker 's name stamped on the heavy handle . " Talbot Fox Company ! " exclaimed Ellery . " Why , if  --  " But the Chief was shaking his head . " I guess seventy-five per cent of Wrightsville has a couple Fox Company screwdrivers in their toolboxes , " he said . " Talbot runs a retail store in connection with the Low Village shop just as a local accommodation . And the three hardware stores in town all carry a heavy line of Talbot Fox Company tools . Besides , this ai n't a brand-new one , Mr. Queen . I 'm afraid we would n't have much luck tryin ' to trace it . " " We can test it for prints . " " I got no equipment , Mr. Queen . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outfit from New York . Wait . " When Ellery returned , he carried a small kit . " I 'm convinced he wore gloves , Dakin , but we may as well make sure . " There were no fingerprints on the screwdriver . It had obviously been wiped clean . " That 's that , " said Dakin . " Perhaps not . I have another notion . " Dakin locked up and they walked back to the other house . They found the family and Detective Howie at breakfast . Even the detective looked up eagerly as they came in . But Ellery said : " Now do n't let us interrupt your breakfast . We came back for a screwdriver . Talbot , may I borrow a good strong one for a few minutes ? " " Sure thing . " Talbot rose . " I keep my tools in a shed on the other side of the house . I 'll get one for you . " " We 'll go with you . " " But wo n't you have breakfast first , Mr. Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red . " And of course , Mr. Dakin , you 'll  --  " " Thanks , Mis ' Fox , but I can't. "  | " We have some work to do , " said Ellery apologetically ; and they followed Talbot out of the house . The big man went out by the front and turned right at the foot of the porch steps , walking across the lawn parallel with the porch and then turning right again to trudge along the farther side of the house . Ellery and Dakin looked at each other . The same thought had struck them . But they said nothing ; and when Talbot entered the large whitepaintedshed , they entered behind him . It was the toolhouse and workshed of a methodical man . There were a huge work-bench , an efficient-looking lathe , a variety of drills and saws and planes and chisels , and other smaller tools , all neatly racked . In one rack ten screwdrivers hung in a row , in ascending sizes . " Will one of these do ? " asked Talbot . He indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's even bigger ? " asked Ellery doubtfully . " There 's one here that  --  " Talbot stopped , looking puzzled . " I did have a jumbo number . " " The one that hung in this slot ? " Dakin pointed to a blank place in the rack . " Yes . Funny , I always put my tools back after I use them . Maybe  --  Wait . I 'll ask the family . " Talbot left quickly . When he had disappeared , Ellery and Dakin made a swift but thorough examination of the shed . " Just as much nothin ' , " grunted Dakin . Talbot came back looking more puzzled than before . " Nobody seems to have used a screwdriver , " he said . " I do n't understand it . " " Well , it 's not important , " said Ellery heartily . " It 's been mislaid somewhere , no doubt . I 'll use one of these others , if you do n't mind . " " Help yourself , Mr. Queen . " Talbot left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big screwdriver he had found inayard Fox 's foyer and dropped it into the empty space in the rack.  | It completed the set . " That 's why you thought he came from around this side of the house ! " exclaimed Chief Dakin . Ellery nodded . " He slipped into Talbot Fox 's shed here first , to get some tool that would serve as a jimmy , then proceeded around the front of the house , across both lawns , to the living-room window of the other house . I first became conscious of him as he passed under the porch where I was lying . " " So it could have been anybody under the sun , Mr. Queen . " " I 'm afraid so . Either someone from the house , who slipped out the side door to the shed and then around to the front , or someone from outside who came up the Hill , visited the shed first , and then continued toward the other house . Anybody . . . that is , anybodybut Bayard Fox . " " Anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I swear I ca n't get over it , Mr. Queen . You 'd think it would be Bayard Fox ! " And there the curious incident of the thief in the night seemed to peter out . Chief Dakin departed to call on the Foxes ' neighbors along the Hill  --  " drop in friendly-like , like I was on the trail of a sneakthief , and ask a few questions . You never can tell  --  " while Ellery bathed , shaved , tended his wounds , and then went downstairs for a belated breakfast . Davy and Linda had gone shopping in Slocum , Talbot had departed for the factory , and after Emily served Ellery his eggs and saw that the toaster and coffee pot were filled , she excusedherself on the plea of housework and trudged upstairs . So Ellery found himself alone with Bayard  --  alone , that is , except for Detective Howie , who was drinking his fifth cup of coffee in a sulky isolation . " Any luck with your memory , Bayard ? " Ellery asked cheerfully as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racking my brains , Mr. Queen , hut I just ca n't seem to remember about that drawer . " " Well , let 's see . Could you have kept , say , business records in there ? " " I do n't think so , " said Bayard doubt I oily . " Talbot and I used to keep our records at the shop . " " Letters ? Private correspondence , that you preferred not to leave lying around ? " " I did n't have any correspondence like that , Mr. Queen , " replied Bayard quietly . " Any other kind of papers ? " " I just ca n't recall , Mr. Queen . " Ellery said suddenly : " A gun . " Bayard looked startled , and Howie lowered the cup from his lips . But Ellery was smiling . " Davy mentioned to me originally that you and he sometimes went camping up in the Mahoganies when he was a youngster . I thought you might have hunted . Of course , you could n't have kept a shotgun in that drawer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with revolvers  --  " " I never did hunt , " said Bayard . " Oh ? " " I did n't believe in killing , " said Bayard . Detective Howie gaped at his prisoner . And then he burst into a spasm of wheezes and gurgles which , freely interpreted , might have been laughter . Bayard flushed to the roots of his sparse white hair . He flung a bitter , shamed glance at his jailer , jumped up from the table , mutteredsomething , and quickly went upstairs . " Hey  --  " said the detective , scowling . He ran after Bayard . ICEllery finished his breakfast in a thoughtful silence . At noon Chief Dakin telephoned . He was glum . " No luck , Mr. Queen . Nobody saw anything , nobody heard anything , nobody found anything . "  | " We could hardly have expected anything else , " Ellery consoled him . " You sound mighty unconcerned ! " " Devotion , Dakin , devotion to a cause . You learn that after some few years . Remember Javert ? An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look at Howie . " " You look at him , " growled Dakin . " I 'm goin ' home for a wash and somethin ' to eat . " " You 'll follow up on the outsider angle ? " " I 'll do what I can , Mr. Queen , but after talkin ' to the Hill folks , I ai n't optimistic . It was dead of night , and Wrightsville 's a hardworkin ' , hard-sleepin ' town . " " Which might make the job easier , Dakin . If somebody was up , and did see our visitor , he 'd be more likely to remember . " Chief Dakin grunted . " By the way , the only one I missed was Emmeline DuPre . She was n't home . It 's close by , so you might drop in on her yourself . If anybody saw somethin ' , it was the DuPre woman . She does n't miss a trick , ever . " " Right , Dakin . " Ellery strolled down the Hill to Miss DuPre 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . For a few moments he lingered on her chaste porch , slightly irritated . It was exactly like Emmy DuPre to be missing when you wanted her . But then he shrugged and left . It was improbable that even the town snoop had seen or heard anything . Ellery resisted the impulse to stop in at the John F. Wrights ' next door to Miss DuPre 's . A call now would only lead to questionsabout the Bayard Fox case . He ambled down the Hill and struck out for town . At the northeast corner of Upper Whistling and State Ellery paused . Should he walk down State Street and drop in on Chief Dakin at Town Hall ? But there could scarcely be any news yet . So Ellery crossed State Street ; he would walk about High Village for a bit . He strolled past the Upper Whistling side of the Northern State Telephone Building and crossed narrow Jezreel Lane . In thep151Lower Main-Upper Whistling corner " block " beyond , which is largely taken up by the sprawling building of the Five-and-Dime , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and one of these is Miss Sally 's Ten Roome . Miss Sally 's Tea Roome is what upper-crust Wrightsvillians of the female sex call an " intime " place : it is frothy with lace curtains and shaky colonial-reproduction tables and chairs , along one wall ranges a row of booths done in lemon leatherette , the waitresses are dressed uniformly in highwaisteddun-colored dresses reaching to their shoetips and wear mobcaps , and the daily menu , handlettered by Miss Sally herself in Old English and peppered with " Ye Olde 's , " is dominated by cream sauces and sweets . Ellery shuddered and passed on . But it was not to be . He heard a feminine shriek behind him : " Mr. Queen ! Oh , Mr. Queen ! Stop ! Wait ! " An aged female was leaning out of the doorway of Miss Sally 's Tea Roome , gesticulating frantically . " Yes ? " said Ellery , walking back . The woman 's face , a stern , withered , withal simple one , looked familiar . Then he chuckled . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Carnegie Library on State Street . " " You remember me ! " exclaimed Miss Aikin , clasping her hands to her bosom ecstatically . Then she seized his arm . " Wo n't you come in for a moment ? Please , Mr. Queen ? " " Into the Tea Roome ? Well . . . But is anything wrong , Miss Aikin ? " " You see , we do n't know , " whispered Miss Aikin , leading him through the crowded restaurant . Heads swiveled and eyes trailed him  --  elderly feminine heads largely and elderly feminine eyes  --  and he plowed past them leaving a wake of whispers . Damn Miss Aikin for luring him into this culinary harem ! " That 's why EmmelineDuPre was just trying to get you on the telephone , Mr. Queen . And while she was off at the phone I happened to look up , and there you were passing Miss Sally 's ! Is n't that providen-tial ? "  | Ellery felt better . At least he could dispose of that loose end . Unless . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen something ! Good old Emmy DuPre ! " Where is Miss DuPre , Miss Aikin ? " he asked eagerly . " I mean , where 's the phone ? I must talk to her . " " Oh , I 'll fetch her , " said Miss Aikin hastily , coloring . " Here , do sit down here , Mr. Queen , in our booth . Emmy and I purposely picked it for privacy . Of course , if we 'd known that you  --  " and she was gone , disappearing through a modest little white doorway which bore the legend in baby-blue paint : LADYES . In a moment the door burst open and Miss DuPre 's mottled , ophidian features appeared . She scuttled toward the lemon-colored booth , a huge dog-eared book of some sort pressed to her flat chest . Miss Aikin scuttled after . " Mr. Queen ! " Emmeline DuPre exclaimed . " Do sit down . Do . Now please . Oh , this is fortunate ! Do n't ever mention miracles to me again . " And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Aikin onto the bench opposite , and crowded quickly in beside her . Ellery found himself facing the two excited spinsters across a table . ghastly with the half-nibbled corpses of creamed chicken patties , Waldorf salad with ersatz whipped cream and maraschino cherry , and Miss Sally 's famous dessert specialty , PineappleMarshmallow Nut Mousse . " I just tried to get you at Emily Fox 's , but Emily did n't know where you 'd gone , and  --  " " Exactly what was it you saw last night , Miss DuPre ? " demanded Ellery . Both ladies stared at him . Then at each other . " Saw last night ? " repeated Emmy DuPre . " Why , whatever can you mean , Mr. Queen ? I did n't see anything last night . " The bony cartilage of her nostrils quivered . " Should I have ? " Something else ? Ellery blinked . " I 'm not very bright today , " he said with an apologetic smile . " I was thinking of another matter entirely . What was it you ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aikin exchanged glances again . " Well , " said Miss DuPre , and her tongue flicked over her lips.  | " It all started with Miss Aikin 's collection of autographs of famous Wrightsvillians , you see , and - Ellery sat spellbound as Emmeline DuPre , with an occasional timid interjection from the librarian , unfolded the saga of Shockley Wright and the elusive autograph , and how Miss Aikin had nearly found it through Myron Garback , the late proprietor of the High Village Pharmacy , when Garback recalled that in his record-book of special receipts there was a genuine Shockley Wright signature ; and how Fate had then intervened  --  " Atropos , " as Miss DuPre put it  --  and the precious scrawl had remained in Limbo when poor Mr. Garback inconsiderately dropped dead of thrombosis that very week end when he had promised to " look it up . " And finally how Garback 's successor , the detestable Alvin Cain , had **25;455;TOOLONG barricades against the wheels of culture by refusing to be bothered digging up the old record-book . " At that point Miss Aikin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegant way , " feeling that my powers of persuasion , Mr. Queen , might exceed hers . " Ellery felt like saying : " Quite . Quite , old girl . " But he did not . " Of course , I agreed to help out of civic duty . Miss Aikin 's collection is a positive museum piece . I mean , it 's invaluable , Mr. Queen . I mean , it will undoubtedly go down in the history of Wrightsville . No common tradesman like Alvin Cain  --  " Miss DuPre sniffed  --  " could be permitted to withhold the sole signature of a member of the Wright family missing from Miss Aikin 's collection . Do n't you agree ? " Mr. Queen agreed , cautiously . Stand pat , old boy , he said to himself . Some sense will creep out of this heap of words yet . " But we won ! " cried Miss Aikin rapturously . " Oh , tell Mr. Queen how we won , Emmy ! " " Well , I tried and tried , " said Miss DuPre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own eyes , Mr. Queen ; how I coddled that swarthy vulgarian !  --  but not until this morning did the creature give in . Since he virtually ejected me from his drugstore  --  and not merely once , Mr. Queen !  --  I 've been bombarding him with letters . A letter a day ! I 've waged a positive campaign . And this morning he phoned me  --  I must say he was awfully mad  --  and said all right , he 'd give me the Shockley Wright autograph , if only I 'd stop bothering him , and if I 'd stop by the store this morning he 'd be only too glad to  --  " Miss DuPre 's skinny neck lengthened  --  " I believe his exact words were get you out of my hair . ' " " At which Miss DuPre hurried down to High Village , " said Miss Aikin breathlessly , " and the next I knew about it , she appeared at the Library with Myron Garback 's old record-book under her arm , and I went out with her to an early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and . . . oh , I 'm so grateful to you , Emmy , I sha n't ever be able to pay you back ! " " Nonsense , Dolores , " said Miss DuPre gruffly , although she was pleased . " It was my duty to posterity . " And after Miss Aikin cleared some dishes away , Miss DuPre laid the large , worn tome she was still clutching to her down on the table between them . Ellery saw now that it was not a book , as he had at first thought , but a ledger . Shockley Wright 's signature .. . He was puzzled and alert . He had never even heard of Shockley Wright , through the John F. Wrights or anyone else in or out of Wrightsville . He could not imagine why the Misses DuPre and Aikin should think the tale of the Wright clan 's black sheep and Miss Aikin 's Javert-like hunt for a specimen of his handwriting would interest the man who had come to Wrightsville expressly to settle the guilt or innocence of Bayard Fox . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the ledger . " You see , Mr. Queen , " she explained , " Shockley Wright once came into Mr. Garback 's drugstore to renew a prescription , and because the medicine had dope in it or something , Mr. Garback made Shockley sign for the renewal in this book . That 's how Providence works its wonders ! . . . There ! Is n't it a dream ? " The " dream " was an almost illegible scrawl on a long page full of other signatures , all precisely dated and bearing notations in a uniformly copperplate handwriting , presumably the hand of thep155late Myron Garback himself . As for the precious autograph of Shockley Wright , its author must have been in an especially bravura mood when he signed for the renewal of his prescription ... away back , Ellery noted , 1928 . " So when we found the Shockley Wright , " Miss Aikin babbled on , " we naturally kept searching through the record-book  --  you never can tell , and a ledger like this is such a fountain of autographs !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three specimens of other famous Wrightsvillians far superior to those I already have in my collection  --  " " The fact is , " interrupted Emmeline DuPre , " we 've found something else . " She lowered her head and narrowed her eyes and sprayed Miss Sally 's Tea Roome with a glance that very nearly hissed . " Something else , " said Ellery . His pulse told him that he might now dismiss the matter of the prodigal Wright from his mind . He had been summoned in a matterfar more important . " Something else ? " he repeated . " What ? " " The year 1932 , " whispered Miss DuPre , with the air of an Underground heroine plotting liberation under the noses of the Gestapo . " The year 1932 , " said Ellery , blinking . " To be exact , " whispered Miss Aikin , " June 5 , 1932 . " " June 5 , 1932 ? " Ellery sat up very straight . " You see , Miss Aikin  --  I mean , Dolores ? " said Emmy DuPre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You were so right , Emmeline , " said Miss Aikin adoringly . " What about June 5 , 1932 ? " snapped Ellery . Miss DuPre riffled through the ledger with a maddening smile . But finally she found a page , about one-third through , and the horny nail of her predacious forefinger immediately stabbed at a line of writing . " There , " she announced , " it is , Mr. Queen ! " Ellery seized the book and read the following , in the prevalent copperplate script : " Renewal prescription #32541 . June 5 , 1932. "  | And after that , in an altogether different handwriting , the name " Bayard Fox . " " It struck me instantly , " Emmeline DuPre was hissing . " I followed the trial very closely , you know . That date in Myron Garback'sledger was only a week or so prior to the murder of Jessica Fox ! And I do n't recall anything 's coming out at Bayard Fox 's trial about a medicine renewal just before the murder , Mr. Queen ! " " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes behind the severe spectacles round as a child 's , " that it was very significant , and that you would certainly be interested , because you were looking into the whole case , Mr. Queen  --  " " Yes , yes , " said Ellery . " I certainly am , ladies . You were quite right to call this to my attention . Er  --  Miss Aikin . I 'm going to appropriate this ledger  --  " " Oh , no ! " shrieked Miss Aikin . " Not again ! My Shockley Wright  --  " " Lower your voice ! " Miss DuPre poked her friend sharply in the side . " But Emmeline , you did n't say Mr. Queen would take  --  " " How should I know he 'd want the old book permanently ? " mumbled Miss DuPre . But her eyes were glittering . " As if you did n't , Emmy DuPre ! Oh , I might have known I 'd lose out somehow if I got mixed up with you ! You do n't have a reputation in Wrightsville for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emmy DuPre . " After I went and got you your old Shockley Wright ! That 's gratitude , is n't it , Dolores Aikin ? I 've a good mind to  --  " " Ladies , ladies , " said Mr. Queen hurriedly . " Miss Aikin , you may remove the pages right now that contain the signatures you want for your collection . As long as you leave this page intact . " " Oh , thank you ! " It took the librarian two minutes to locate the page on which the rare Shockley Wright autograph appeared , her hands shook so . Finally she tore the page out , and two others . " Thank you , Mr. Queen ! " she beamed.  | " Do n't mention it . And I mean  --  do n't mention it . That goes for you , too , Miss DuPrc . " Ellery sat studying Bayard Fox 's signature in the ledger for some time after Miss Aikin and Fnimrlinc DuPrre left Miss Sally 's Tea Roome , Miss Aikin clan bin her autographs and trying to placate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chin high , implacable . At last Ellery rose . " Sir ? " One of Miss Sally 's mobcapped damsels was offering him a slip of chartreuse paper . " What 's this ? " In Miss Aikin 's case it had undoubtedly been excitement . But there was no mistaking the case of Miss DuPre , who never forgot anything . In passing , she had stuck him with the check for the CreamedchickenPatties , the Waldorf Salad Garni , and the Pineapple MarshmallowNut Mousses . ALVIN CAIN WHISKED OUT from behind the fumed-oak parapet of his prescription department . " One teaspoonful every four hours , Mrs. Gonzoli , " he said briskly , wrapping the medicine bottle in the distinctive candystripedwrapping paper of the High Village Pharmacy . " Kapeesh ? " " Four hou ' , " repeated the Italian woman . " And that does n't mean every time your old Signor feels like a snort . Eighty-five cents . Viva Italia ! Next , please . . . Oh . "  | " Hullo , Alvin , " said Chief of Police Dakin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Cain . " " And Mr. Queen . Still doing the snooperoo , huh ? " " Still doing the snooperoo , " said Ellery , looking around . " Say ! " Cain 's shrewd eyes fixed upon the ledger under Ellery 's arm . " Is n't that my ledger ? " " It is . " " Well , I 'll be  --  How 'd yQU get it ? " Cain demanded hotly . " I 'll bet that DuPre bag  --  I might have known a favor to that damned old creep would be a sure way to get into trouble ! " " No trouble , Alvin , " said Chief Dakin . " We just dropped in to check up a point . How far back does your prescription file go ? " " All the way  --  to when Garback opened this store . Why ? " " We 'd like to take a look at the original prescription for your number 32541 . " " Come on back . " They followed the pharmacist into his stock room . It was surprisinglyclean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Thirty-two five forty-one . " " Any idea what year it would be ? " " You might try 1932 , " said Ellery . Cain turned to the wall . A row of long steel needle files hung there , thousands of prescriptions jammed onto a file . " What 's up ? " the pharmacist asked curiously as he ran his eye over the bunches of prescriptions . " We found a record in here , " said Dakin patiently , " that may have somethin ' to do with the Fox case . So we want to check the original prescription , Alvin . " " Oh . Sure . " Cain took down one of the files and began to run through the tightly packed papers . " Thirty-two five forty-one ? . . . ought to be along in here somewhere . . . 32822 . . . 32654 . . . 32550 along here . . . yep . " He held the prescription exposed . It bore the printed name MILO WILLOUGHBY M.D. , and the address " PROFESSIONAL BUILDING , VVRIGHTSVILLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handwriting , was May 23 , 1932 . Ellery could make out the name " Mrs. B. Fox " and something- " oz , " but the rest was gibberish to him . " What 's this prescription say , Cain ? I never have understood how pharmacists can decipher the hen-scratches on most doctors ' prescriptions . " " Tincture of digitalis , i ounce , " said Alvin Cain . " The original prescription that Doc Willoughby wrote for JessicaFox 's digitalis ! " exclaimed Chief Dakin . " What 's the rest of this scrawl ? " asked Ellery . " It says 15 drops three times daily . ' " " It 's the original prescription , all right , Dakin , " said Ellery , frowning . " Cain , do you happen to recall a renewal of this prescription ? In early June of that same year ? In fact , on June fifth ? " " What d'ye think I am , a mental giant ? " laughed Cain . " This pharmacy 's handled I do n't know how many thousands of prescriptionsand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But it concerns the Fox murder case , " said Ellery . " Everyone 's had such a wonderful memory about the Fox murder case , Cain . " The pharmacist stared at him . " You kidding ? " " No , indeed . " " Well , I do n't remember . Twelve years ! " " Take a look at this note in Garback 's record-book . " Ellery set the big ledger down on Cain 's worktable and opened it to the page which bore the copperplate-hand notation and the Bayard Fox signature . " Here ? " The pharmacist was puzzled . " Who wrote this line , Alvin ? " asked the Chief . " About Renewal prescription # 32541 , June 5 , 1932 ' ? It 's Myron Garbage 's writing . " Ellery and Dakin exchanged glances . " The old poop owned this store at that time , " Cain went on , " and I was just a lowly clerk here . Ah , them were the days  --  no headaches and all of twenty-eight per ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garback made him sign for it . "  | " Oh , then you recognize this ' Bayard Fox , ' " asked Ellery quickly , " as being Bayard Fox 's signature ? " " Say , what are you trying to pull , Queen ? " asked Alvin Cain angrily . " I do n't recognize anything . I would n't know Bayard Fox 's signature from a hole in the head . It says ' Bayard Fox ' and it 's not in Garback 's handwriting , so I take it for granted Bayard Fox signed it . Anything more I can do for you gents ? I hear a customer out there . " " We 'll take that prescription , Alvin , " said Chief Dakin mildly . " Go ahead and serve your customer . I 'll fish it off this hook myself . " Dakin was abstracted as he drove Ellery out of town and back up the Hill . It was as if he were trying to catch up with something which was just beyond a bend of his brain . He kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , worriedly . Ellery merely stared ahead . Linda and Davy were seated on the top step of the porch . " Mr. Queen ! " cried Linda . " Well ? " " Well , ' Linda ? Well ' what ? " " Well  --  anything , " Linda laughed . " There 's something , Linda  --  but I doubt if it 's going to be a great comfort . " Linda stopped laughing . " But what you said during the night  --  " began Davy blankly . " Oh , that . No news on that yet . Eh , Dakin ? " " No . " Dakin pursed his lips . " I guess it 's hopeless , Davy . We ai n't found a trace of the one who broke into the house last night . " " You will  --  I 'm sure you will , if you keep looking hard enough , " said Linda eagerly . She touched the ledger under Ellery 's arm with a timid finger . " What 's this , Mr. Queen ? " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Ellery . " Davy , where 's your father ? " " In the parlor . With Three-Chins. "  |p161Ellery  and Dakin hurried into the house . Linda and Davy looked at each other , and then just as hurriedly followed . Bayard was sitting back at one end of Emily 's settee , a checkerboardon the middle scat beside hint . At the other end squatted Detective Howie , in a dark red rage , glaring at the board . " Take me , " chuckled Bayard . " Take me , Howie , and you 're licked . " Howie 's paw flicked out to slap the board from beneath , so that it leaped like a wounded thing from the settee . The pieces flew in all directions . " I 'll take you , you s.o.b. , " he choked . His little eyes were flaming with hate . " I 'll take you and I 'll lose to you , but I wo n't lose in the end , you s.o.b . " Bayard calmly retrieved the fallen checkers . He straightened the board and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes eleven games , " he smiled . " Come on , Howie , I 'll play you another . " Howie slapped the board again . This time Bayard did not smile , nor did he attempt to go after the checkers . " You got the right name , Fox , " panted the detective . " Yeah , you 're smart , all right . But just the same you 're jail-bait , Foxy . And you 're going to stay jail-bait . I 'll  --  " Then Howie saw Ellery in the doorway , and his complexion turned yellowish . " Hello , " said Ellery . Howie started to hoist his great body , then sank back . " Well , look who 's here , " he snarled . " The master mind from New York . The genius who 's gon na whitewash the wife poisoner . How you doing , genius ? " " Is this life of idleness getting you , Howie ? " murmured Ellery , stepping into the room . Dakin lingered in the doorway , the ledger behind his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring from him to Dakin and Linda and Davy in the doorway . " Yes , Mr. Queen . " He sounded anxious . Ellery handed him a sheet of blank notepaper and a fountain pen . " Write your name , " he said . " Now he 's gon na play games , " sneered the fat man.  | From the doorway Davy said : " Linda , let go of me ! " " No , Davy ! " " He 's got it coming to him , Lin ! " Detective Howie , grasping the arm of the settee , had half-risen , his great calves taut . " I wo n't take any more of his poison ! The way he talks to Dad  --  and now he 's started on Ellery Queen  --  " " Davy , " said Chief Dakin gently . He put his big hand on Davy'sarm . " Write your name , Bayard , " said Ellery again . " But Mr. Queen , why  --  " Please . " Bayard took the pen and notepaper , placed the paper on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheet and glanced briefly at it . He nodded at Dakin . Dakin came into the room with the ledger , opened it , and placed the signature Bayard had just written near the signaturein the ledger . " They do n't look exactly the same , Mr. Queen , " Dakin muttered . " No two specimens of a person 's handwriting ever are the same , Dakin , " frowned Ellery . " A million samples will show a million variations . . . But the base-characteristics remain . There 's no doubt this name in the ledger is in the handwriting of BayardFox . " Dakin said softly : " Mr. Fox , will you take a look at this signa-ture ? " Bayard 's glance followed the route of the Chief 's forefinger tothe line on the ledger . " Is this your John Hancock ? " " But Mr. Dakin , " began Bayard , " I do n't begin to see  --  " " Is this your signature , Mr. Fox ? " " Yes , but  --  " Dakin rapped : " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the big tapestried armchair with a sigh . " Comein here , Linda . You , too , Davy . " Linda and Davy obeyed in perplexity  | " Briefly , the situation 's this , " said Ellery wearily . " On June 5 , 1932 , Bayard Fox entered the Iligh Village Pharmacy and asked Pharmacist Myron Garback for a renewal of a prescription numbered32541 . Garback renewed the prescription but had Bayard sign for it in this old-fashioned record-hook , whose authenticity is unquestionable : Garback himself mentioned its existence to Miss Aikin , the librarian , only a day or so before he dropped dead , and there are thousands of people in Wrightsville who will vouch for the genuineness of it . . . because they wrote their names in it . " The drug Bayard wanted a renewal of , and for which he signed , turns out to have been the drug called for by I ) r . Milo Willoughby 's original prescription  --  the tincture of digitalis for Jessica Fox 's weakened heart . " Bayard 's hands were semaphoring their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . But before he could speak , Davy said , " I do n't get it , Mr. Queen . What 's the point ? " And Linda nodded in the same bewilderment . " The point , " sighed Ellery , " arises out of a simple matter of chronology . Dr. Willoughby 's original prescription is dated May twenty-third . On Decoration Day  --  May thirtieth , according to the doctor 's own testimony and Jessica 's corroboration  --  Willoughby ordered her , and Jessica obeyed the order , to stop taking the prescribeddigitalis . Yet according to the notation in this ledger , Bayard Fox renewed the prescription on June fifth  --  five days after Jessica discontinued taking the digitalis ! " They saw it now . " Why did Bayard renew that prescription ? What did he want with a fresh one-ounce bottle of digitalis  --  when his wife was no longer taking digitalis on her doctor 's orders ? " Bayard shrank . " I suppose , " said Chief Dakin heavily , " you busted the first bottle , Fox , or maybe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wanted some more digitalis to make sure she 'd kick off when you  --  " " No ! "  |p164Bayard  sprang to his feet . His skinny neck resembled a picket fence . Linda ran out of the parlor . Davy looked after her , swallowing . And then his jaws crunched and he strode out , too . " Davy  --  " cried Bayard hoarsely . But his son neither paused nor looked back . " If this evidence had come out twelve years ago at the trial , " said the Chief of Police quietly , " you would n't be servin ' a life sentence now , Fox  --  you 'd have fried . " Bayard sank back onto the settee . He seemed dazed . Oh , thought Ellery , if I could only make up my mind about this man . Bayard whispered : " There 's some mistake somewhere . I never went to Garback 's drugstore for a renewal of that digitalis prescription . Dakin regarded him almost with admiration . But then he shrugged and turned away . " Mr. Dakin  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swear to you  --  I 'll swear on anything  --  tell me what to swear on  --  I swear this is n't true . I did n't get a second bottle of digitalis from Garback . Or from anyone else ! You 've got to listen , Mr. Queen  --  I did n't ! " " And your signature in this ledger showing receipt of the renewal ? " asked Ellery , closing his eyes . " It 's a lie ! " " But you just identified it yourself . " " I did n't know what it meant  --  what this was all about ! " " Sure you did n't , " said Dakin dryly . " You forgot about signing in Garback 's ledger , Fox  --  twelve years is a long time to remember every detail of your crime . If you 'd remembered , or if we 'd told you first off what it meant , you 'd have said it was n't your signature . D'ye think we 're fools ? " " Listen . Listen , " said Davy 's father . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Yes . ' Because it is . I mean  --  it looks like my signature . But I tell you I never wrote that signature ! I 've never seen this ledger before ! "  |p165Ellery  opened his eyes . " Then what 's your explanation , Bayard ? " he asked sharply . " I have n't any , Mr. Queen . I ca n't give you one . All I know is I did n't sign this ledger and I did n't renew that prescription . " Dakin glanced at Ellery , shaking his head . " I guess that 's that , Mr. Queen . " He picked tip his hat . " And about time , too , " said a screeky voice . Detective Howie wore three fat grins now . " Do I take this wife poisoner back to the Pen now , or do I wait till mornin ' , Mr. Queen ? You 're the doctor . " I Cowie sounded positively jovial . Ellery grimaced . " Go away , Howie . I want to think . " The detective guffawed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Your genius wants to think . " He hustled Bayard out of the parlor . Chief Dakin hesitated for a moment , looking down at Ellery . Then he said , in an uneasy way : " Well . I 'll be at my office if you want me , Mr. Queen . " " Right , Dakin . ' By . " But Chief Dakin did not go . Instead , he said encouragingly : " Do n't feel too bad about this , Mr. Queen . After all , it was in the cards . " " Yes , yes , Dakin . Good-by now . " " Well . . . " Dakin , shaking his head , went out softly . IT SEEMED TO ELLERY that only a few minutes had elapsed , but when the door slammed upstairs and Linda 's smothered shout broke in on his senses he found his muscles stiff and the parlor filled with late-afternoon shadows . He sat up straight in the tapestried chair , listening . The doorslamhad been brutal and Linda 's cry a formless utterance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall . He found Emily Fox there looking up the stairs anxiously . " Was n't that Linda , Mrs. Fox ? " " Yes . " Emily called up : " Linny ! What 's wrong ? " There was no reply . " Linda  --  " " just a moment , Mrs. Fox , " snapped Ellery . In the silence they heard , faintly , a wild weak sobbing . Ellery took the stairs three at a time , Emily panting behind him . Linda was not on the first floor . They ran up another flight . She was stretched out on the top-floor landing . Emily dropped to her knees . " Lin baby . Lin . Dearest  --  " " It 's Davy , " sobbed Linda . " Mother , he 's packing . " Emily grew pale . She put her chubby arms about Linda , pulling the girl up to her breast . Linda clung , like a child . Ellery went to the door of the " apartment " bedroom and knocked . Davy 's voice said hoarsely : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went in , shutting the door behind him . Captain Fox was in full uniform . He was packing a duffel bag and a valise , which were spread out on the twin bed he had not slept in since the night of the lightning storm . When he saw who it was , he reddened . " Hi , " he said . " Davy , why are you packing ? " Davy looked him in the eye . " I should think that would be obvious to you . . . of all people . " " You 're going away ? " " Naturally . " Ellery leaned against the door and lit a cigaret . " You have it a little twisted , Captain . I should say  --  Unnaturally. ' "  |p167Davy  stopped packing . " Are you kidding ? " " Not at all . " " But I do n't get it . You ought to he packing , tool " " Why ? " " Well . . . you 're through , are n't you ? " " What makes you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evidence you just turned up  --  that prescription renewal  --  " " What about it , Davy ? " " What about it ! " Davy 's nose wrinkled with pure astonishment . " Maybe I 'm missing today , " he complained . " What about it ? You told us yourself what about it  --  this afternoon ! " " You mean that the development today makes your father look like your mother 's murderer ? " " Well , sure ! " " But that 's been the pattern all along , Davy , " said Ellery dryly . " Nothing 's really changed , you know . I see no reason why finding another indication of your father 's guilt should make us all quit cold . " Davy could only stare at him . " It is n't as if turning up this fresh evidence made Bayard break down and admit it 's been true all along . On the contrary . He 's more vehement than ever in his denials . " Davy sank onto his bed to clasp his hands between his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linda 's . " I do n't know what you expect me to say , " he muttered . " How much blind faith am I supposed to have ? " " At least as much as Linda . She 's out there in the hall crying her eyes out because the man who tried to strangle her wants to leave her . " Davy scowled ferociously . " Mind you , " continued Ellery , examining a smoke ring very critically , " I 'm not saying I believe Bayard , Davy . And I do n't deny the importance of a corroborative bit of evidence . But I 'm still dissatisfied . " " Takes an awful lot to satisfy you , seems to me , " mumbled Davy.  | Ellery ground his cigaret out in an ashtray on Davy 's highboy . " Well , " he said , " there 's still a point or two . " " Huh ? " " The most immediate being : Who broke into the house next door last night , and what was it he stole ? " Ellery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit on a case with a tag end like that left hanging . The fact is , your father simply could n't have been the housebreaker-thief last night , on the positive testimony of our fat friend Howie , who of all people on this planet is least likely to want to cover Bayard Fox up . Bayard being eliminated , the field is left wide-open . . . . Before I give up , I want to know what was taken from your father 's secretary last night . And I want to know who took it . And also why . Do n't you ? " " I  --  I guess I do , " muttered Captain Fox . " I guess I did n't think . " " I guess you did n't , " smiled Ellery . " Now suppose you go on out there and put your arms around your wife and tell her what a damned fool you are . . . you bloody hero . " Davy flushed scarlet . " Socko , " he said . " Watch me crawl . " Adjusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallowed a few times , and then he went to the door like a small boy bound on order for the woodshed . Emily was waiting for Ellery in the downstairs hall . " Thanks very much , Mr. Queen , " she said quietly . " Oh , he could n't have been permitted to leave now , Mrs. Fox . " Ellery was abstracted . " Tell me  --  I meant to ask you when Linda cried out upstairs and broke my chain of thought . What 's happened to the lawyer who defended Bayard at the trial ? " " Mr. Moodus ? I do n't know , Mr. Queen . Mr. Moodus went away after the trial and  --  " " Was n't Moodus a local man ? " " Oh , no . He was a Boston lawyer . Judge Eli Martin recommended him to Bayard as a very good trial man , I seem to recall . "  | " Really ? I did n't know old Judge Martin 'd been involved . " " He was n't , Mr. Queen . It was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Fox boys , ' as he used to call Talbot and Bayard . He watched them grow up in Wrightsville . " " Judge Martin , eh ? " Ellery smiled . " Well , thanks , Mrs. Fox . I think I 'll take a little walk . " " Ought to be horsewhipped , " said Judge Eli Martin severely . " In town for the Lord knows how long and did n't look me up ! " " Guilty , guilty , " sighed Ellery . " But Judge , I 've been a little busy . " " So I hear . " Wrightsville 's eminent jurist was as gaunt and little and dry-mannered as ever , and his eyes were just as deceptively sleepy as Ellery remembered them from the days when he defendedJim Haight , stepping down from the Bench to do so . " So I hear . " " Shut up in this museum piece , " grinned Ellery , " I wonder that you hear anything , Judge . " Judge Martin looked around , chuckling . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fusty old retreat in the County Lawyers ' Block for forty-five years , and I would n't change it for all the marble in the newfangled County Court House . . . . When are you going to give up , Mr. Queen ? " " Give up ? " " Phil Hendrix tells me you 're having a time of it . " " How would Phil Hendrix know ? " retorted Ellery . " Detective Howie , " said Judge Eli dryly . " Well , well , what is it , young sir ? How can I help you ? You did n't drop into my office at five-thirty just to hold my feeble hand . " Ellery laughed . " All right , Judge . What do you know about the Jessica Fox murder case ? " Judge Martin rather deliberately opened the lowest drawer of his battered walnut desk , reached far in , came up with a black and bowlegged Italian stogie , lit it , puffed long and vigorously , and finally sat hack . " Have to hide my smokes from Miss Finegold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finey and Doc Willoughby are in a conspiracy to lengthen my life by five years . . . . Why , I do n't know what you mean . Know ' about it ? " " You know exactly what I mean , " drawled Ellery . " Well ... " " I take it you have n't any undisclosed facts in that secret drawer of yours  --  or have you ? " " Heavens , no . " " How familiar were you with the proceedings ? " " I followed it fairly closely at the time . " " And your sympathies ? " " In my business , " remarked judge Martin to his stogie , " if you have any such , you sit on ' em till they smother to death . " " Then you did have some . " " Perhaps . " " For the victim or the defendant ? " Judge Martin tapped ashes into his waste-basket . " Young fellow , you 're not going to pump me on that . Where my sympathies lay is irrelevant  --  purely emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidential value , no standing in court . " " What did you think of the verdict ? " persisted Ellery . " My personal opinion ? " Judge Eli squinted at him through the acrid smoke . " I do n't like the kind of evidence they convicted Bayard on . As a judge , I mean . I prefer something substantial when you 're trying a man for his life and liberty  --  like finger-prints . " " But from a sheerly logical point of view  --  " " Oh , certainly . " The Judge waved his cigar . Ellery sucked the knuckle of his right thumb , frowning . " It 's true , " he admitted . " I have n't got very far . . . . How well did you know Bayard Fox , Judge ? " he asked suddenly . " Very well . " " Did you consider Bayard the killing type ? " " Is there one ? " retorted the Judge . Ellery grimaced . " You see the sort of thing I 'm reduced to . "   " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because I 'm not convinced Bayard lox committed that crime . Among other reasons . " " You think he did n't ? " asked Judge Martin slowly . " I did n't say that . I just do n't know one way or the other . The circumstances say he did . The man himself says he did n't . I mean  --  not merely his mouth . The whole man . his eyes . The tone of his voice . The way he moves his hands . " " People earn their living that way , " the Judge growled . " Oh , yes . That 's hart of my problem . " " Very interesting , " murmured Judge Eli . " I may as well tell you . . . I 've felt the same way for twelve years . " Ellery nodded . " I gathered as much . " " Let me tell you something I was n't going to . " Judge Martin put his high-topped shoes on the desk and puffed at the ceiling with its intricate plaster curlicues around the modernized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jessica Fox 's death , she invited Clarice and me to her home for dinner . There were just the four of us  --  Jessica and Bayard , and my wife and I. Davy was only a sprout of eight or nine , so he 'd been given his dinner beforehandand sent to bed . " It was a very pleasant dinner , and Clarice and I had a nice time . I liked their home , because it was just that  --  not an institution , like so many of the houses on the Hill . And the thing that made it a home was  --  strangely enough  --  not Jessica , but Bayard . " The Judge frowned . " Bayard was at peace there  --  that was it . He liked his home . He was proud of it . And proud of Jessica . More than proud . He was deeply in love with her . You could see it in the way his eyes followed her every gesture and movement . They followed her like the eyes of a dog . Like my old Pete , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And then after dinner . It was one of those times when Jessica was minus a maid  --  she was the kind of woman who has maid troubles all the time  --  so she cleared the table , and Clarice helped her . I admired that in Jessica  --  she did n't indulge in the fussy little formalities that make Hill dinners such a trial . " Bayard and I went into his study for cigars and brandy while the women were busy . As we sat there , Bayard said to me : As long as you 're here , Judge , I wonder if you 'd mind looking somethingover for me . ' I said of course I did n't mind , and he showed me a will . He 'd typed the will out himself , he said  --  he 'd always neglected making one before  --  and he 'd signed it and had it witnessed , but he wanted to make sure it was a sound legal instrument . As it happened , it was  --  a perfectly good will , and I told him so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night . In his will he 'd left everything to Jessica  --  everything he owned , down to the last collar button . The language of the will  --  his own language  --  was almost embarrassing , it was so full of endearing terms . And the way he talked to me about his wife there in the study  --  well , " said the Judge queerly , " if that man was n't head over heels in love with that woman , I do n't know a thing about human nature . And I 'd have sworn it was n't the kind of love that makes a man kill . I 'd have said it was the love that 's unselfish and sacrifices itself  --  that would hurt itself before it hurt its object  --  the real kind of love . " And the Judge fell silent . " But that was long before Bayard found out about another man , " Ellery pointed out . " Feelings change . People change . " The judge squinted at him , his brows together . " I knew I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's  --  " he waved the cigar  --  " it 's unjuridical . " Ellery rose . " Well , " he said , " I 'm much obliged . " " Come visit Clarice and me before you leave Wrightsville , Mr. Queen , " said Judge Martin , rising too . " Thanks , I 'll try , but do n't count on it . Please give Mrs. Martin my very best . " " She 'll hate you if you do n't give her a chance to throw a dinner  --  and what 's more , make the rest of my life miserable . " The Judge shook Ellery 's hand warmly . " If there 's anything I can do  --  say , with Phil Hendrix , if Phil gets difficult  --  "  | " Thanks , Judge . " Ellery went slowly to the door . There he paused , frowning . " This will you mentioned , " he said . " Could it possibly have had anything to ( 10 with  --  ? " The Judge smiled sadly . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that had the remotest connection with the events of Jessica 's subsequent illness and death . All it said was that it left everything to Jessica . There were no other bequests , no conditionsnot a word in it could have had any significance as far as the murder case was concerned . For all I know , Bayard never even looked at that will again after that night . When I handed it back to him , he locked it in a drawer of his secretary and we went back to join the women  --  " The judge put his frail hand quickly on Ellery 's arm . " Why , what 's the matter , Mr. Queen ? " he exclaimed . " Did you say , " asked Ellery hoarsely , " did you say Bayard locked the will in a drawer of his secretary ? Is that what you just said , Judge Martin ? " " Why , yes . " The old gentleman looked blank . " What 's so startlingabout that ? It was an empty drawer , and he put the will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key ring . Why ? " Ellery breathed in deeply . " An empty drawer . Do you happen to recall which drawer , judge ? " " The top drawer , I think . " " The top drawer , " repeated Ellery . " You 're sure of that ? " " As sure as I can be after so many years . But  --  " " Tell me , Judge . The will was a simple document  --  " " Typed on an ordinary sheet of white paper . " " It bore the date  --  " " December something , 1931 . " " Who were the witnesses ? " " Amos Bluefield , the Town Clerk , and Mark Doodle , who used to run the cigar stand at the Hollis  --  Mark was a notary , too . You remember old Amos  --  I think he died while you were here a few years ago on the Haight case . " Ellery 's eyes were snapping . " Yes , indeed , " he said . " Judge , may I use your phone ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well , go ahead . "   Ellery grinned and telephoned Chief of Police Dakin 's office . " Dakin , I 've found out what was in that locked drawer of Bay-ard 's . " " You have ! What ? " " Bayard 's will . Dated 1931 . " " His will ? I did n't know he ever had a will . " " Well , he made one out , but Jessica 's death and what happened to him afterward apparently drove it out of his mind . It 's under-standable . " " It is ? Not to me ! Why in tunket should somebody swipe a will thirteen years old that  --  Who was the beneficiary ? " " Jessica . " " His wife ? Then why was it swiped ? Twelve years after she died and was buried ! " " I can supply the answer to that question , " said Ellery grimly , " now . " Dakin was astonished . " I s'pose you 'll tell me you know who stole it , too . " " Certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know all the facts , it 's simple enough . " Dakin sounded both eager and fearful . " Who ? Who was it , Mr. Queen ? " " I 'll meet you in Prosecutor Hendrix 's office in fifteen minutes . " ELLERY FOUND PROSECUTOR HENDRIX pacing the floor of his office at the County Courthouse . Chief of Police Dakin wasp175hunched in a chair with his big hands between his knees , looking uncomfortable . " Oh , Queen . " Hendrix hurried forward . " Now what 's all this ? " " I 've told Phil everything that 's happened , Mr. Queen , " said Dakin , rising hastily . " You seem worried , Mr. Hendrix , " remarked Ellery . " Worried ? Certainly not . Why should I be ? It was n't my case . I mean  --  " The Prosecutor spread his hands . " Sec here . If there 's been a mistake  --  a miscarriage of justice  --  go easy , will you , old boy ? " " May I sit down ? " " Sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm afraid , " said Ellery , crossing his legs , " that friend Dakin 's been premature . Did you tell Hendrix I 'd cracked the case , Dakin ? " " Well , sure . Did n't you just say on the phone  --  " " I said I knew why Bayard 's will was stolen last night , and who stole it . " " But  --  " Ellery shook his head . " Let 's go back , " he said . " I 've now establishedbeyond a doubt the facts about that locked drawer . I 've checked them . After phoning you , Dakin , I phoned Bayard at his brother 's house . When I mentioned the word will , ' Bayard suddenly remembered . And he confirms Judge Eli Martin 's account . He 'd locked the will in the top drawer of his secretary , a drawer otherwise empty , and he was positive he had n't opened the drawer again . We have no reason to doubt that statement . Wills are made out and put away . Bayard made his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonably conclude that Bayard 's will lay . in that locked secretary drawer for twelve and a half years . " " And then all of a sudden somebody comes along lookin ' for it , " cried Chief Dakin . " Not necessarily . " Prosecutor Hendrix demanded : " Now what do you mean by that , Queen ? " " I mean that the fact that the housebreaker took the will doesn'tP176prove he broke into the house to look for the will . As a matter of fact , the most cursory consideration of the data at our disposal shows that , on the contrary , the prowler did n't want the will as a will at all . " The two men looked bewildered . " For what conceivable use could that will have been to anyone  --  anyone on earth ? " Ellery went on . " It was Bayard 's will , disposingof his estate in the event of his death and naming his wife sole legatee . But look at this peculiar pair of circumstances : The wife is dead , and has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as you lawyers say , Hendrix . What does that do to the will ? " " Makes it obsolete , of course . " " What does a testator usually do when his will becomes obsolete by virtue of the beneficiary 's prior death and the will moreover has not provided for a  --  what do you call it , Hendrix ?  --  a contingentbeneficiary ? " " Why , if testator does n't want to die intestate , he 'll make out a new will naming a new , living beneficiary . " " Exactly . Did testator do that ? The fact is  --  our second circumstance  --  he'sdone better than that . He disposed of his estate before his death  --  gave up all title to it during his lifetime . BayardFox , shortly after he went to prison , signed legal papers turning his whole estate over to his son , in trust until Davy should come of age . " So today  --  last night , when that 1931 will was stolen  --  the will was not only obsolete as a legal instrument , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate was a settled and dead issue years and years ago . " Consequently I say : The thief could not have stolen the will for its significance as a will  --  it has none . Therefore he stole it for a different reason entirely . " Dakin was shaking his head . " I ca n't even imagine a different reason , Mr. Queen . " " And yet , Dakin , a different reason must exist , since the thief did steal that document . Well , let 's see . If the will was not stolenP177as a will , what could it have been stolen for ? For the paper it was typed on ? " Hendrix laughed . " You 're not serious . " " No , because Judge Martin told me the paper was the most ordinarytype . If not for the paper , then for what ? " " The date ? " asked the Prosecutor doubtfully . " But the date , too , is obviously meaningless . It was dated Decembersomething , Nil  --  months before the people and the events resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every will ? " " The witnesses ' names ? " suggested Chief Dakin . " But Judge Martin told me  --  and Bayard confirmed this over the phone just now  --  that the witnesses were Amos Bluefield , Wrightsville Town Clerk at the time , and Mark Doodle , a notary . Why should the thief have wanted those witnesses ' names ? For some obscure reason to discover who the witnesses had been ? But then he 'd merely have had to look at the will , he would n't have taken the will away with him . Then did he want a sample of the witnesses ' names , their autographs ? He 'd scarcely have to resort to housebreaking and theft if that was his purpose . There must be thousands of documents extant bearing the name of the Town Clerk , and of course a notary 's name would appear in hundreds of very ordinary papers . So the witnesses ca n't have any significance in the theft . What 's left ? " " The only other thing on a will , " shrugged Hendrix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that certainly ca n't be  --  " " Why ca n't it be ? " asked Ellery . " The name Bayard Fox ? " ejaculated the Prosecutor . " It 's not just a name , Mr. Hendrix , " said Ellery gently . " It 's a signature . " " Signature ? " " Bayard Fox 's signature ? " said Dakin blankly . Ellery nodded . " Bayard Fox 's signature . What 's more , Bayard Fox 's indisputably authentic signature . If there 's one place a man would be careful to have a good , clear , unimpeachable specimen of his signature , it would be in his will . "  | And there was silence . " I do n't understand , Queen , " said the Prosecutor finally . " Me neither , " groaned Dakin . " But it 's so simple ! " cried Ellery , leaping from his chair . " Does n't Bayard Fox 's signature have a significance in this case ? Dakin , you ought to be able to answer that ! Because we found Bayard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's given up ! " " The Bayard Fox signature in Garback 's record-book of prescriptionrenewals ! " said the Chief slowly . " Of course . Now re-examine the facts . Last night , after twelve years , someone broke into Bayard Fox 's house and stole an obsoletedocument whose only possible value to the thief , as we 've just seen , was the authentic signature Bayard Fox signed to it twelve and a half years ago . That was last night . And what happensthis morning ? A piece of new evidence comes to light , the crux of which is a Bayard Fox signature ! Coincidence , would you say , Mr. Hendrix ? " " The thief wanted a specimen of Fox 's signature , " gasped the Prosecutor , " in order to forge a Bayard Fox signature in Garback 's old record-book ! " " Yes , Mr. Hendrix . If you 'll have that entry in Garback 's ledger examined by an expert , I 'm sure he 'll find that a previous , authenticentry in that space was eradicated and the Bayard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by thunder ! I never thought I 'd find that in Wrightsville ! " " Then the note about the prescription number in Garback 's handwriting , " muttered Hendrix , " must be a forgery , too . " " Undoubtedly . For that the thief needed to look no farther than 1 the ledger itself  --  it contains hundreds and hundreds of samples i of Garback 's writing . But a sample of Bayard Fox 's signature was another matter . He decided the old residence of Bayard Fox , which had remained untouched since the murder , would be a likely place to find one . So he broke in and ransacked it , starting with the breakfront and drum-table in the living room , being unsuccessful , and hunting further . In the study he tackled the desk . Unsuccessful there , too , he tackled the secretary . And then he came across a locked drawer . He could scarcely have resistedP179forcing it to see if the drawer might not contain what he was looking for . And he was lucky  --  he found an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ' ! " exclaimed Chief Dakin . " Who 's ' he , ' Mr. Queen ? You said you knew . " Ellery stared at the lank Police Chief . " But do n't you see that , Dakin ? " he asked incredulously . " That 's the clearest part of it ! How did that ledger of Garback 's , with the forged Bayard Fox signature , come to light ? " " Miss Aikin and Emmy DuPre were lookin ' through it  --  " " How did Miss Aikin and the DuPre woman come to be looking through it ? " " Why , Miss Aikin 's been tryin ' for years to get hold of the ledger so she could snag Shockley Wright 's autograph for her collection , " said the Chief blankly . " And when Alvin Cain gave it to Emmy DuPre this morning  --  " His mouth remained open . " Exactly , " said Ellery dryly . " Alvin Cain gave it to Emmy DuPrethis morning  --  the morning after the theft of the authentic signature ! After years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aikin , or more recently to Emmeline DuPre , this morning Alvin Cain suddenly does so ! In fact , this morning Alvin Cain was so obliging as to phone Emmy DuPre that he 'd give her the ledger if she 'd stop in for it . . . when he 's been evicting her from his drugstore merely for asking ! " I do n't think there 's any doubt about it , gentlemen . It was Alvin Cain who broke into the house last night , stole the will , and banged me on the head . It was Alvin Cain who spent the rest of the night forging that entry in the ledger . And he knew there was an excellent chance two snoopy old ladies like Dolores Aikin  --  always on the hunt for autographs  --  and Emmy DuPre  --  always on the hunt for anything  --  would come upon the forged entry and call it to my attention . And I do n't doubt that , if they had n't done so , Alvin Cain was prepared to ' run across ' the entry himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come on , " he said . P180They found Alvin Cain in his pharmacy exchanging pleasantries with a young lady of high-school age who was giggling over a chocolate ice-cream soda . Cain paled slightly when he saw Dakin , Prosecutor Hendrix , and EIlcry . " With you in a minute , boys ! " he called gaily . " No hurry , Alvin , " drawled the Chief of Police . The three men sat down at one of the tiny triangular service tables near the soda fountain . They said nothing , merely looking at the pharmacist . Cain 's pallor deepened . He winked at the girl and started busily for his prescription department . " You 'll find Officer Charley Brady out there by your back door , Alvin , " called Chief Dakin gently . " That is , in case you wanted some company for a walk , or something . " Cain looked foolish . He turned on his heel and went slowly back to the fountain . He said to the girl , quite without humor or charm : " Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bubbles . Shake your bobby-socks . " The girl stared at him . Then she threw fifteen cents on the counter and stalked out . At once Chief Dakin rose from the little table , went to the front door , and latched it . " What is this , Cheee ? " grinned the pharmacist . " A hold-up ? I do n't close till eleven . " Dakin drew the dark heavy door-blind and snapped off the lights at the front of the store . " Just so we wo n't be interrupted , " he explained . " Now come over here to the table , Alvin , and sit down so we can have a nice , friendly little talk . " The short man in the starched and spotless ecru linen jacket came over reluctantly . He looked smaller and squatter suddenly , as if he were drawing himself in around his center . He sat down in a gingerly way , on the very edge of the tiny chair , looking from one to another of those set faces with a half-expectant , rather silly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he joked , " cut for dealer ? " " All right , Cain , " said Prosecutor Hendrix abruptly . " Why 'd you forge Bayard Fox 's signature and fake that prescription-renewal entry in Myron Garback 's old ledger ? " Alvin blinked . He kept blinking . " Forged ? Fake ? What  --  what arc you batting about , Mr. Hendrix ? " he stammered . " I owe you a little something , " remarked Ellery pleasantly . Cain 's glance darted at him , and away . " For that crack on my skull , Cain . Remember ? Also , my shoulder still aches , and you can see the deplorable condition of my hand for yourself . But I 'm perfectly willing to trade . Open up , and I wo n't knock you stupid . " Alvin Cain , Wrightsville 's fashion-plate , raconteur , and Casanova , kicked over the small table , hurled his chair at the three men , and rushed for the latched front door . Prosecutor Hendrix went down , but Ellery caught the chair and Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cosmetics , drew a snubby automatic and fired one shot at the wildly scampering pharmacist . Cain stopped short , lost his balance , and fell . He lay still . " Dakin , you hit him ! " cried the Prosecutor , scrambling to his feet . " Naw , " said Dakin . " I purposely shot wide . The bullet 's in the doorjamb . " He was white with anger . He strode over to where Cain was lying , grasped the man by the back of the collar , and yanked . " Yellow , " he said . " These blowhards are all the same . You goin ' to talk , Cain ? " All the muscles of the man 's face were out of control . His lips flapped and his jaws twitched , and his eyes rolled in his head . " I 'll talk , " he babbled . " I 'll talk . Just do n't shoot . I 'll talk . " " Tell the pretty story to the Foxes , " drawled Ellery . They were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P181 Ellery , Alvin Cain , the Talbot and the Davy Foxes , Bayard Fox , and Detective Howie . The pharmacist , his linen jacket streaked with the oily grime of his drugstore floor , his thinning curly hair on end , his shoes scuffed , cowered in a chair with his hands over his face , motionless . " Well , Cain , " said Ellery . " Tell it . " Cain blubbered without uncovering his face : " I did n't mean any harm . Fox is guilty as hell anyway . I did n't commit any crime . I did n't  --  " I might , " said Ellery amiably , " turn you over to Captain Fox . He used to dream you were a Jap , Cain , and you know what our hero did to the Japs . " Cain 's hands dropped quickly . Davy went over to the chair and stood before it . " Stand up , Cain . " The pharmacist shrank , looking up terrified . " No ! Do n't let him  --  " " Stand up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " He 'll talk , Davy , " said Ellery . " He 's already talked , but you 're all entitled to hear it , and telling his cute yarn to you folks may help wash some of the spots off his grimy little soul . " " I 'm waiting , Cain , " said Davy . Cain began to talk , fast . " I knew what Queen was trying to do here  --  Dakin told me over the phone when he said I 'd be needed for questioning . Yesterday I . . . got to thinking . Maybe this Queen would get old man Fox off . The odds were against it , becauseeverybody knows Fox poisoned Mrs. Fox  --  " The silence cut in as deeply as an interruption . " I mean , " stammered the pharmacist , " he was convicted , was n't he ? Sent up ? And nobody ever questioned his being guilty till this snooper Queen showed up . . . . " And now Bayard Fox asked slowly : " What difference is it to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prison ? " Cain licked his lips , glancing at Ellery almost as if for help . Seeing none there , he muttered : " Dakin 'd said it was being done , most of it , for Davy Fox . He was going to  --  to leave Lindap183if Queen could n't get you off , Fox . I guess I ... wanted to make sure Queen did n't get you oil . " Linda was staring at the cowed pharmacist with complete incredulity . " You mean you did all this to ... " Cain flushed . He looked down at the Prosecutor 's floor and cracked his knuckles in an agony of nervousness . " Let me get this , " said Captain Fox calmly . " Cain , you tried to frame an additional piece of evidence against my father so Mr. Queen would say my father was really guilty and I 'd walk out on Linda ? " Cain grasped the arms of the chair . " I 'd leave Linda . . . so you could have her ? " Cain blabbered : " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . Cain got out of the chair like a cat and darted behind the massed backs of Ellery , Chief Dakin , and Prosecutor Hendrix . He crouched there , clinging to Ellery 's coat-tails . Ellery caught Davy 's arm , and Linda sprang forward to cling to him . " No , Davy ! You ca n't believe I 'd want him ! Davy , do n't ! He is n't worth it ! Please , Davy ! " " So he was making a play for you while I was in China , " panted Davy . " Linda , let go ! Mr. Queen , let go of me ! I want to teach him a lesson he wo n't  --  " Dakin and Hendrix jumped in , and they got him out  --  Linda and Emily and Talbot pleading with him , and Bayard following with a look of intense concern , as if his only stake in these events was the well-being of his son . Detective Howie , bewildered , brought up the rear . Chief Dakin and the Prosecutor and Ellery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having been packed off to the top-floor County Jail for booking and detention . " But can we hold him ? " frowned Dakin . " After all , Phil , he tried to frame a man for a crime the man was convicted of and 's been servin ' sentence for for a dozen years ! That 's a peculiar situation , Phil . "   " Do n't worry , " said Prosecutor Hendrix with a grim smile . " We 've got enough on Mr. Alvin Cain to keep him busy for some time . lie committed forcible entry  --  that 's burglary . If Mr. Queen wants to press another charge , we can get the fellow for assault . And I 'm not sure he is n't guilty on a technical count of forgery . " " And all he did it for was to split up the Davy Foxes . " Dakin shook his head . " Most ridiculous thing I ever heard of . However , Mr. Queen , ' pears to me you 're back just about where you started from . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bayard Fox case , I mean . " " Dakin 's right , " said Prosecutor Hendrix . " We know Cain 's motive , and we know what he did . So we know Bayard was telling the truth when he denied having renewed the digitalis prescription on June 5 , 1932 . But where does that leave you ? As Dakin says , right where you started , without a thing changed : With the whole case against Fox exactly as it stood twelve years ago  --  the case on which he was convicted of poisoning that grape juice . " " Ca n't see it any other way , Mr. Queen , " nodded Dakin . Ellery regarded them with a curious half-smile . He seemed about to make a crisp remark , but apparently he changed his mind , for he shook his head slightly and gnawed at one of his swollen knuckles . Then he looked up . " By the way , whatever happened to the ; original pitcher and tumbler ? The ones Bayard actually used in the preparation and serving of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibits in the trial , " replied Chief Dakin . " You back on that tack , for tripe 's sake ? " " I 've been going over the facts again . " " Man , you 're a hound . " " You do n't mean to say you 're still going to work on this case ? " asked Hendrix , astonished . " Oh , yes , Mr. Hendrix . " " But I thought with the washout of this last development you 'd see the handwriting on the wall and  --  "   " It 's only been a couple of days , " said Ellery humbly . " And you promised me a couple of weeks . " " Naturally I 'll keep my promise , Queen , but I tell you this is a sheer waste of  --  " " Time . I know , Mr. Hendrix . But I have plenty of time , and we have n't annoyed you very much , have we ? To get back to the pitcher and tumbler  --  " " They ca n't be any use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " By the time I 'd laid hands on ' em twelve years ago , they 'd both been washed . Remember , there was no suspicion of murder till Mrs. Fox died a whole day and a half later . " " But what happened to them , Dakin ? " Ellery persisted . " The usual . After the conviction , they were turned over to the Property Clerk at the Police Department . I think  --  Wait a minute . " Chief Dakin picked up one of the Prosecutor 's phones and called his office . " Uh-huh . " He hung up . " I thought so . The Property Clerk returned'em to the Fox house wrapped up in a cardboard box after the trial , Mr. Queen . " " Thanks , Dakin . " Ellery rose . " I believe , " he said mildly , " I 'll amble on back and see what happened to that box . " P186DINNER THAT NIGHT WAS horrid . Except for Detective Howie , who ate with the slow greediness of the fat , they scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . They seemed to be waiting upon Ellery 's pleasure , as if he held the key to their mood . But Ellery nibbled away in silence . So they were all relieved when Chief Dakin dropped in during the dessert . " Find what you were lookin ' for , Mr. Queen ? I happened to be passing on my way home , so I thought  --  " " I had an idea you would , Dakin , " grunted Ellery . " So I 've been waiting for you . " He turned to the Talbot Foxes . " Chief Dakin tells me that the Property Clerk of the Police Department returned the original pitcher and tumbler used in the preparation of the grape juice shortly after the end of the trial twelve years ago . Do you happen to remember what you did with them ? " " I do n't recall any pitcher or tumbler being returned , " Emily said doubtfully . For the first time in over a day she addressed her husband . " Do you , Talbot ? " Talbot brightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Why , I never stopped , " said Emily , reddening . " Anyway , do you , Tal ? " The big man 's chest expanded perceptibly . " Well , now , " he said , beaming , " let 's see . Pitcher and glass . . . No , I ca n't say I do . "   " They were delivered in a cardboard box , " explained Chief Dakin . " Wrapped in brown paper , and scaled . " " Brown paper .. : Emily frowned . " Why , " Talbot , you remem-ber ! " Talbot looked puzzled . " I do n't seem to , dear . " " Well , I do . I did n't know what was in the package or I 'd have recalled right off . " Emily became positively voluble , and Linda , holding Davy 's slack hand , smiled a little . At least someone 's straightening out her troubles , her smile seemed to say . " The pack- age was put in Bayard 's house before we locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mercy , Talbot , you put it there yourself ! " " I did ? " Talbot was embarrassed . " Funny , Emily , I do n't seem to recollect a thing about it . " " You never did have much of a memory , " sniffed his wife . " Mr. Queen , that package is next door . When we took Davy to live with us  --  " her voice softened  --  " we decided to get him everything new . Clothes , toys , books , everything . " " I remember that , Aunt Emily , " said Davy suddenly . " I rememberit was like Christmas . " " I remember that , too , " said Talbot . " I put all Davy 's kid things  --  the things he 'd been using up to that time  --  up in the attic in the other house , for storage . " " Well , I 'm sure you 'll find that cardboard box up there , Talbot , too , " said Emily . Chief Dakin glanced at Ellery . Ellery pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could desert the dishes for a while , Mrs. Fox ? " he smiled . " I 'm rather anxious to inspect the contents of that box , and I think we all ought to be there when it 's opened . " So back they went , in the soft Wrightsville evening , to the house of Bayard Fox . It looked unreal in the waves of the swimming moon , a dark house growing out of dark rank vegetation , and all as if suspended  --  an unknown world at the bottom of an alien sea . The night and death are brothers ; and this was where both had dwelt for a dozen years . The group carried flashlights , silent . The smell of must was so strong in the attic that Ellery and Dakin hastened to open the fanlights . Every board groaned underfoot ; each rafter was laced with swayingwebs ; and the moon peered through cracks in the roof . " Goodness , " said Linda with a shaky laugh . " It 's like a set for a Boris Karloff movie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davy softly . " Remember , Dad ? " And Bayard smiled back : " I remember , son . " " All my toys , " Davy said , looking around . " Every last one of ' em ! Here 's my football ! " He stooped to pick up a sodden pulp of pigskin , long since deflated . The skin was scuffed and tattered . He stroked it with an embarrassed forefinger . " Your catcher 's mitt , Davy . " " That League ball I snagged when Linny and I sneaked over to Exhibition Park and got our hides walloped for staying away at the baseball game till dark ! " " It was a double-header , " giggled Linda . " And oh , gosh , I could n't sit down the whole next day , Daddy Tal was so mad . " " Here 's my chem set , that I used to do experiments with ! " " And look , son , " exclaimed Bayard , " your Erector construction set . Remember that bridge you and I built ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davy stood wide-legged in the glimmer-streaked darkness , his teeth showing white and his blue eyes dancing . Talbot retrieved a loose-leaf album with battered corners from beneath a mound of broken toys . " Say , Davy , " he said , " is n't this your old stamp album ? " " By gosh , it is ! " " Ought to take it over to John F. Wright . He 's a collector . Maybe there 's something valuable in here . "   " Aw , they were just kid stamps , Uncle ' Cal . In terrible condition . They 're not worth anything . " " They are to me ! " cried Linda , and she took it from her fosterfather . " I 'll save it , " she said softt ly , " for  --  some other little boy . " And Emily said : " Your marbles , Davy . Mercy , there must be hundreds of them in this old flour sack . " " And my tickets ' ! " Ellery let them exclaim and rummage as he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes very sharp . Suddenly he pounced . They stopped chattering to look at him with something like apprehension . " This solves one mystery , " said Ellery , standing up . He had found beneath the splintered wooden lid of the boy 's chemistry set a bottle of too aspirins . " The missing aspirins , " chuckled Dakin . He looked at Ellery almostwith pity . " Never even opened , " muttered Ellery . " This case is one letdownafter another . Ah ! Is this the package the Police Property Clerk returned ? " Under a heap of dog-eared books he had found a square box , wrapped in plain brown paper , tied with string and the string pressed to the wrapping with wax seals . " That 's the one ! " cried Emily . " Now I remember , " her husband said foolishly . " Yes , it bears the Police Department seal and rubber stamp . Would you mind concentrating your lights on this ? " Ellery said . They surrounded him as he tore the rotten string and ripped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary white cardboard box . Inside the , box , carefully wadded with newspapers bearing the date " 1932 , " were a big wide-mouthed purple-glass pitcher , covered with incised grape designs , and a purple tumbler identical with those in the kitchen cabinet downstairs . As Ellery held the pitcher and glass up to the light , turning them over and over , their spirits fell again , as if the purple objects drew to themselves all the sparkle the group had found in the attic , leavingthe place  --  and them  --  in black emptiness.  | " What is it , Mr. Queen ? " asked Chief Dakin . He had seen a flash in Ellery 's silver eyes . " I 'm not sure , Dakin , " murmured Ellery . " Let 's go downstairs to the kitchen . . . . No , there 's no water in the house , is there ? " " I had the water turned off twelve years ago , Mr. Queen , " said Talbot Fox . " Same time as the electricity and gas . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clutched the pitcher and tumbler as if he were afraid someone might try to take them from him . " We had better get back to your house , Mr. and Mrs. Fox . Immediately ! " " It occurred to me , Dakin , " Ellery explained as he studied the interior of the purple pitcher under a strong light in Emily Fox 's kitchen , " that even though the original pitcher had been washed , as you told me this evening , something might still be salvaged . If the grape juice had stood in the pitcher for some hours , and if the washing had been a hasty rinse , particularly under cold water , there might still be some evidence left inside the pitcher . " " Evidence ? " Chief Dakin 's tough forehead split into brown wrinkles . " What kind of evidence , for the Lord 's sake ? " Ellery said , " Come here . " They crowded around . " Unfortunately , the glass is practically opaque , so you ca n't see the line very clearly through it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faintest , thinnest dark line rimming the inner circumference of the pitcher in a perfect circle . " Sediment , " Ellery said . " The grape juice stood undisturbed for a long time , and where its surface touched the pitcher wall a sedimentformed and eventually caked . It caked so hard that when the grape juice was poured out and the pitcher rinsed , the sediment line was not washed away . It remained . And here it is . " " What does it mean , Mr. Queen ? " Linda asked eagerly . Ellery smiled . " Well , Linda , by the position of the water-line on a jetty you 'd be able to calculate how high the tide had been . Inp191the same way , by this sediment line , we can tell exactly how much grape juice was left in this pitcher twelve years ago after the fatal drink was poured . Let 's make a test . Linda , may I borrow your engagement ring for a moment ? " " My engagement ring ? " frowned Linda . " You mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Please . " " But that 's supposed to be bad luck ! " " In this case , " replied Ellery with a smile , " it might be very good luck . " Linda took her diamond ring off quickly . Ellery held the pitcher up to the powerful light : the sediment line was barely discernible as a faint hair of shadow through the deeply purple glass . Using the diamond of Linda 's ring , Ellery scratched a careful line on the outer surface of the pitcher to mark the precise position of the sediment line inside . Then he handed the ring back to Linda , who slipped it on very hurriedly indeed. , " Merely for convenience , " Ellery explained . " Now let 's see . We know Bayard prepared exactly one quart of dilute grape juice , or four glassfuls . Let 's use this purple tumbler as a measuring cup , since it was a glass identical with this that Bayard used twelve years ago in measuring out the equal parts of grape juice and water , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went to Emily 's spotless sink and , turning on the cold-water tap , filled the purple glass to the brim and emptied it into the pitcher . He did this four times . " Now , " he continued , turning to them again , " four of these half-pint glasses make one quart , so there 's exactly a quart of liquid in the pitcher , as there was when Bayard first prepared the grape juice . Look at the sediment line . " The water level inside the pitcher was considerably higher than the guideline Ellery had scratched on the outside . " Well , sure , " said Davy . " The sediment formed after Mom 's one glass of grape juice had been removed from the pitcher . You just put in a whole quart , but there was a quart minus one glassful when the sediment line caked . "   " Quite right , Davy . Then you would say , " Fllc.ry asked , " that if I poured out into this glass all the water now showing above the sediment line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Of course . It must . " " That 's right , " said Dakin . " One glassful  --  the amount Davy 's ma drank . " Ellery canted the pitcher and filled the purple glass to the brim . Then he held the pitcher up to the light . The water-line and the sediment line did not coincide . The water level was still higher than the scratch-mark . " Do you find that strange ? " murmured Ellery . " Well , let 's keep pouring water out of the pitcher till the water-line and the sedimentline do meet . " He did so , slowly , to make sure the water level did not sink belowthe scratch . And when , under the light , water level and guidelinecoincided , Ellery held up the purple glass into which he had poured off the excess liquid . It was filled to the brim . " One more glass , " gasped Dakin . " Another glassful ! " " I do n't understand , " said Emily , bewildered . " It 's simple enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve years Wrightsville has believed that only one glass of grape juice was poured from the purple pitcher that morning , the glassful Bayard poured for Jessica . " This demonstration proves that two glasses of grape juice were poured that morning ! " " But we were so sure Jessie drank only one , " said Bayard , dazed . " Why , she told that to Dr. Willoughby herself after she felt so sick . Why should Jessie have lied about a thing like that ? " " Exactly . Then who drank the other glassful ? " For the first time since coming to Wrightsville , Ellery 's voice rang with the old authority . " Because someone did . Was it you , Bayard ? " And Ellery added in a quiet tone , " If you 've never told the truth before in your life , Bayard , tell it now . Did you drink that second glassful of grape juice that morning ? "  | " No ! " " You , Talbot ? Before you left the kitchen after your talk with Bayard ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rinsed it so carelessly ? " Talbot shook his head emphatically . Ellery turned to Bayard again : " You poured Jessica a glass of grape juice and you then left the house . You returned after an absence of two hours and found Jessica violently ill. ' ! ' hose are the facts . Was she alone when you got back home , Bayard ? " " Yes , Mr. Queen . " " What did you do ? Try to recall everything . " " Immediately ran to the phone and called Dr. Willoughby . He said he 'd rush right over . " " And then ? " " I tried to make Jessica comfortable , help her some way . She was being sick to her stomach , and I held her head . I do n't know what else I did . Marked time , I suppose , till the doctor came . He was over in a matter of minutes . " " And during this interval the pitcher of grape juice stood on the coffee table in plain sight . " " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ! " " Did Jessica ? " " No . She was too busy retching , vomiting , holding on to me . She was crying and scared  --  " " Did Dr. Willoughby touch the pitcher when he arrived ? " " He did n't even glance at it . He hurried Jessica upstairs to the bedroom and went to work on her there . " " You 're positive Dr. Willoughby did n't touch the pitcher of grape juice . " " I 'm positive . " " Did you go upstairs with Dr. Willoughby and your wife ? " " No  --  the doctor told me to stay downstairs , that I 'd only be in his way . He said he 'd call me up if he needed me . So I stayed where I was . "   " In the living room ? " " Yes . " " With the pitcher of grape juice  --  still untouched . " " Yes . " " What did you do then ? " " The living room was in a mess . I was upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by cleaning up after her . It took me .. well , a long time . " " Yes ? Go on . " " When the mess was all cleaned up  --  I just sat there . In the living room . Waiting . " " And you still had n't touched the pitcher of grape juice , Bayard ? " " That 's right . " " Precisely when did you empty and rinse the pitcher ? " " I guess I must have sat there most of the afternoon , Mr. Queen . Dr. Willoughby was still working on Jessie upstairs . I 'd say it was around five o'clock before I remembered I had n't removed the pitcher of grape juice . " " And during all that interval  --  of waiting in the living room  --  no one touched the pitcher ? " " No one , could have  --  no one else was there . just myself , and I did n't go near it till five o'clock . " " Then what did you do ? At five o'clock ? " " I remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got up , took them out to the kitchen , emptied the pitcher into the sink , rinsed it once under the cold water  --  and the glass , too  --  and put them both on the drainboard . " " Which is just where I found ' em two mornings later , " exploded Chief Dakin . " The fact that he emptied and rinsed the pitcher was a big strike against him , Mr. Queen , at the trial , if you 'll remember the transcript . Tom Garback convinced the jury he 'd done that to get rid of the evidence  --  the poisoned grape juice left in the pitcher . " " I told Mr. Garback , I told the Jury , " said Bayard wearily , " that I was upset , I was cleaning up . Lord , I did n't know anything about poison ! I thought what Dr. Willoughby thought  --  that the exer-P195tion and excitement of Jessie 's corning downstairs had made her sick all over again . " Ellery had been fingering his lower lip . Now he looked up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after twelve years , people . And it 's su important it may change the complexion of the entire case . " THEY ALL BEGAN TO ASK questions at once , pressing around him . Ellery shook his head impatiently . " Just let me follow through , please . Bayard , you 'd left Jessica alone in the house that morning , directly after she drank her glass of grape juice ? " " Yes , Mr. Queen . " " How did you come to leave ? " " The phone rang just as Jessie finished drinking . She lay back on the sofa and I went out into the hall to answer the phone . It was my brother , calling from the shop . " " Calling about what , Bayard ? " " Talbot said that if it was possible he wanted me to come down to the factory for a while . One of our biggest customers was in town and he 'd asked to deal with me personally in connection with an order . " " That 's right , Mr. Queen , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpectedly . It was an important account , and I thought I 'd better let Bay know about it before trying to handle him my-self . " Bayard nodded . " We could n't afford to antagonize the man , "  | he said . " I told Talbot I 'd be right down if I could . I hung up and went back to ask Jessie if she thought I could leave her for an hour or so , and told her why . Jessie said : Do n't he silly , Bayard . Of course I 'll be fine . You go on downtown . ' I suggested she call Emily over to stay with her , but Jessie said Emily 'd mentioned goingdown to an Eastern Star meeting or luncheon or something . I was a little worried , because Jessie had n't been left alone for months . Even Davy was n't coming home for lunch , because 1 'd given him a lunch box to take to school and Emily 'd given Linda hers so they would n't be whooping through the house at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anyway , I finally went when Jessie promised she would n't move from the sofa till I got back , and that if she felt sick or anythingshe 'd phone me right away at the shop . " " You went to the factory . Then ? " " Our business with this buyer took longer than Talbot and I expected . At the end of an hour I was n't near through with him . " " So you phoned your wife ? " " Yes . I was worried about her . But she still felt fine  --  at least , that 's what she told me over the phone  --  and she talked me into staying and finishing with Mr.  --  who was that buyer again , Tal ? " " Mr. Quimby of the U.S : Canadian Processing Company , Bay . As a matter of fact , Quimby 's still doing business with me  --  with us . " Talbot flushed . " He is , eh ? " said Bayard quietly . " Well , anyway , I stayed and finished up with Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the shop to see Quimby off . " " He was going on to Montreal , " nodded Talbot . " And that was when you found your wife so ill , Bayard ? " asked Ellery . " Yes . I 'd been gone just two hours , Mr. Queen . Jessie was alone , in the living room , on the sofa , the way I 'd left her , and she was just as sick as she could be . " " The times involved , " said Ellery crisply . " You left the house to go to the shop at what time ? " " Eleven o'clock . "   " You phoned your wife at auxin ? " " Yes . " " Then you got back to the house at one . " " That 's right . " " Let 's see what we have . " Ellery scowled . " Jessica was alone in the house for two hours , between eleven and one . " Now we know two glasses of grape juice were drunk , the first by Jessica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other glassful , then , must have been drunk between eleven , when Bayard left , and one , when he returned . " Ellery turned to Dakin . " Dakin , I think you 'll agree with me that someone came to Bayard Fox 's - house during his two-hour absence , that Jessica offered this visitora glass of grape juice from the pitcher on the coffee table , that the visitor drank it , and that the visitor left before Bayard 's return . " Chief Dakin did not reply at once . He rubbed his lowslung jaw , scratched his head , pulled his nose . Then he muttered : " Sure looks like it , Mr. Queen . " Detective Howie 's mouth was widely open . " But who ? " cried Linda. *I have been asked an interesting question relative to the two glasses of grape juice , the answer to which  --  while not directly relevant to the issues of induction that were involved  --  nevertheless will bear exposition , if only for the benefit of those who fret over the finer points . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juice were drawn from the pitcher at different times , why were n't two sediment lines found in the pitcher ? What happened to the sediment line which must have formed in the interval between the pouring of Jessica 's glassful and that of the visitor 's ? It is a fair question , and the answer eluded me for some time . But then I saw what must have happened , and a jog to Bayard Fox 's memory confirmed my theory . The " lost " sediment line , having resulted from the first glassful , was therefore the higher of the two lines inside the pitcher ; that is , it was the line nearer to the pitcher 's mouth . In rinsing the pitcher , Bayard must have used his fingers  --  carelessly , but he used them . He inserted his hand a short way into the pitcher and ran his fingers around the inside . This had the effect of wiping away the upper of the two sediment lines , leaving the lower intact . Had Bayard been thorough , had he swabbed the interior of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , that line too would have been wiped away . . . and there would be no solution of the twelve-year old mystery.  --  E. Q. " Nothing like that came out in the trial , " said Emily Fox , confusedly . " It 's sure a queer one , " said her husband . " I ca n't imagine who  --  " " Aside from who , " cried Davy , " why did n't that visitor - - whoever it was !  --  come forward at the trial ? This is the first anybody 's ever heard of such a person ! " " Yes , that 's peculiar , " nodded Ellery . " Dakin , tell me  --  did anyoneelse in Wrightsville come down with digitalis poisoning duringthe time Jessica did ? " " None that a careful checkup showed , Mr. Queen . We went into that when we knew Mrs. Fox had died of digitalis . No one was reported sick with the same symptoms , and no one  --  this we 're certain of  --  died of it except Jessie Fox . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it through . Was it the visitor who put that overdose of digitalis into the pitcher of grape juice ? Impossible . " Their faces fell . " Jessica drank her glassful  --  the only glassful she did drink by her own testimony  --  before Bayard left the house . She was poisoned by that grape juice . So when the visitor appeared and Jessica offered him  --  or her  --  a glassful from the same pitcher , that glassful must also have contained poisoned grape juice . It 's inconceivable that the visitor would have drained a glassfulof a liquid he 'd poisoned with his own hands . Conclusion : The visitor is innocent . " Davy and Linda exchanged the grimmest of glances . " Now , I think , we have sufficient facts upon which to base a conclusion about that visitor , " continued Ellery , ignoring the gloom that had come over the family . " He drank a glassful or part of a glassful  --  he may have poured some out  --  of poisoned grape juice . No one in Wrightsville , Dakin says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to come forward at the trial ... . The visitor , I say , was a stranger  --  not a resident of Wrightsville or environs at all . " " A tramp ! " exclaimed Linda . " Hardly , Linda , " said Ellery . " Can you see your sick aunt invitinga vagrant into her living room and offering him a drink when she was alone in the house ? No , it begins to appear like someone she knew but who did n't live in town . . . . Tell me , Dakin , " heP199said abruptly . " Is there a train that stops in Wrightsville betweeneleven A.M. and one P.M. ? " " The local to Montreal stops at one o'clock every day , Mr. Queen . " " No good . Bayard returned at one to find Jessica alone . The visitor could n't have come at one  --  he 'd already come and gone by that time . No other train stops between eleven and one during the day , or stopped twelve years ago ? We 'll have to follow that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wait ! " said Captain Fox . " There 's a train about noon  --  the train that let inc oIl when I came home a few months ago ! " " The Atlantic Stater , " nodded Emily . " The express from New York to Montreal . " " But the Atlantic Stater does n't usually stop in Wrightsville , " objected Chief Dakin . " Mostly it goes right on through . " " Just a minute , " said Talbot Fox slowly . " Just a minute . That day twelve years ago the Atlantic State Express did stop in Wrights-ville . " " It did ? " Ellery said quickly . " And how can you remember a detail like that , Talbot ? " " Because of Mr. Quimby . Bay , " Talbot said , turning to his brother , " remember when you left the shop to scoot back to Jessica , Quimby was saying he 'd have to be hustling right on to Montreal ? " " Yes ? " Bayard said doubtfully . " Well , after you left I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warrum about trains , and Gabby said  --  I distinctly remember  --  that it was too bad he had n't come an hour earlier , because the Atlantic Stater 'd stopped at noon . I remember because of the fuss old Quimby kicked up . He was hopping because he 'd not only missed the Stater but the one-o'clock local to Montreal as well  --  we 'd been just too late to catch it  --  so he had to wait four hours for the regular five-twelve local-express , and I waited with him . " " The Atlantic Stater stopped that day , " breathed Emily . " And it never stops in Wrightsville , " said Linda , " except to let apassenger off ! " " Yes , " said Ellery quietly , " it 's a reasonable theory from the facts that someone traveling from New York to Montreal may have dropped off in Wrightsville , at noon , visited Jessica for a half-hour or so , and then caught the Montreal local at one p.m.  --  all while you , Bayard , were at the shop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all looked around . But it was only Detective Howie . " Oh , shut up , " growled Chief of Police Dakin . " To think all this new stuff could come out after a dozen years ! " He looked ashamed . " If it 's true , " he muttered , " then we pulled an awful boner  --  I mean , Tom Garback and me . I thought we 'd investigated everything . How could we have missed a big thing like a stranger gettin ' off a train in a town like Wrightsville ? " " I ca n't imagine , Dakin , " said Ellery sympathetically . " For a flying visit like that , the stranger would certainly have taken a cab from the Station , and the least check  --  " " Cab ! " shouted the Chief . " If that does n't beat hob . Because that 's it . The cab ! " " Cab ? " Ellery looked interested . " Back in ' 32 there was only one cab operatin ' out of the Station  --  run by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he 'd started hackin ' in the horse-and-buggy days . Well , Jessica Fox was poisoned on a Tuesday , so that was the day this stranger may have got off the train . But Mrs. Fox did n't die till Wednesday night and we did n't really suspect murder and start an investigation till Thursday mornin ' . Well , Thursday mornin ' of that week was when Whitey Pedersen had an accident  --  ran right off the road , to avoid one of the Low Village kids who was playin ' in the middle of the street , and smacked into Pete 's Diner ! They had to pull Whitey out of a mess of hamburgers . " " Pedersen died ? " " On the spot . " " Then that 's it , " agreed Ellery . " If the cab driver knew anything , his death before your murder investigation got fairly under way kept him from telling about Jessica 's visitor . And apparently Pedersen was the only one who did know , or you 'd have hit some trail . "   " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dinky and did n't see this stranger get off , " I ) akin nodded glumly . " Pedersenpicked the stranger tip , drove hit ) to the Bayard Fox house , stranger says I 've got to cat , h the one-o'clock , so Whitey picks him back up and drives him to the Station in time to catch the Montreal local . There 's always a mob takin ' that one , so the stranger on the return trip was lost in the crowd . That 's it , " he said , shaking his head . " What stranger ? " jeered Detective Howie . " This fancy baloney . Theories . It 's a pipe-dream . " " You keep your mouth shut and your eyes open , Howie , " growled the Chief , " because you 're goin ' to have to report what you see and hear to Hendrix , and I 'll be there to see you give it to him straight . Go on , Mr. Queen . " " Well , we 've conjured up a stranger getting off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for a half-hour visit to Bayard 's wife . Bayard , that suggests a relative  --  " Bayard shook his head . " Jessie had one brother , Mr. Queen , that 's all . And he was  --  still is , I imagine  --  a Commander in the U.S. Navy . He was on maneuvers in the Pacific all the time this happened . " The Talbot Foxes nodded . " Then a friend , " suggested Ellery . " It would have to be a close friend to have gone to all that trouble for a mere half-hour visit . " " Friend ? " Bayard sucked his lower lip . " Jessica did have one good friend . . . . What was that woman 's name again ? " " Woman ? " Emily Fox grew excited . " Bayard . You do n't mean the Bonnaire woman  --  that singer ? " " Bonnaire , that 's it ! " cried Bayard , his face clearing . " Gabrielle Bonnaire , Mr. Queen , of  --  " And then his eyes widened . " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfactions sometimes . " She 's French-Canadian , Mr. Queen , " Emily raced on . " Jessie and Gabrielle had gone to school in Maine together , and they were intimate friends . Why , Jessie used to write Miss Bonnaire at least once a week  --  did n't she , Bayard ? She used to say it was lots of fun chasing Gabrielle around the globe . "  | " Yes , Emily . That 's right . " " Gabrielle Bonnaire , " Ellery said thoughtfully . " The contralto . " " Oh , she 's famous  --  or was , " babbled Emily . " When she was n't giving a New York concert , she was on tour . She sang all over the world . " Emily paused , to frown . " Come to think of it , l wonder what became of her . I have n't heard or read about her in years and years . And she never sent flowers , or even a note of condolence . You 'd think . . . her best friend . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Queen ? " " Very , " said Ellery dryly . " Mrs. Fox , do you mind if I use your telephone to make a long-distance call or two ? " When Ellery returned to the kitchen , he was smiling again , but grimly this time . " Howie , " he said , " your cynicism got the better of your judgment . It 's not a theory at all . " The fat detective looked blank . " You do n't mean to say , " said Chief Dakin slowly , " that it was  --  " " Yes , Dakin . I 've just located Gabrielle Bonnaire in Montreal . It was the Bonnaire woman who visited Jessica Fox that day twelve years ago , all right , and I 've persuaded her to come to Wrightsville . " She 'll be here tomorrow evening . " EVERYONE HAD GONE UPSTAIRS , leaving Ellery alone on the porch . He had evaded their questions , and they left him withp203noticeable dissatisfaction . But there was no point in talking , and there was nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming from Montreal . It was obvious that none of them foresawthe possibilities . Even Chief Dakin , with a distinctly odd look at Ellery , had said good night and left , clumping down the walk as if to accent his sense of injury . Ellery sprawled in the darkness smoking a cigaret and turning certain matters over in his mind . The occasional grunt of a Hillclimbingcar only emphasized his feeling of aloneness ; it did not disturb him . From where he sat , the sky to the southwest had a bonfire look  --  the red neon lights of High Village . Elsewhere there were stars in profusion . The same lights and the same cold stars , Ellery thought , had been visible to Jessica Fox from very nearly the same observation point . He wondered what her thoughts had been before her long illness  --  married to quiet Bayard Fox , perched it must have seemed for eternity on the barren eyrie of Wrightsville , and a handsome and virile brother-in-law next door whose own restlessness , no doubt , matched hers and drew them together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the force of that communion . Wrightsville can be cramping to those who yearn for long horizons . He thought that Jessica 's unflagging correspondence with the worldly Gabrielle Bonnaire during uneventful years of marriage and domesticity in the small town beckoned to an end more vital than feminine friendship . To Bayard Fox 's wife , imprisoned in Wrightsville , Gabrielle Bonnaire must have personified the glittering Outside . Gabrielle was Paris , and London , and Buenos Aires , and Rome , and Cairo , and all the rich far places which Wrightsville sees only at the Bijou . By maintaining the postal friendship with the singer Jessica Fox achieved a superiority of experience over her fellow-Wrightsvillians which must have satisfied , however imperfectly , her cosmopolitan cravings ... . Ellery was jarred from his thoughts by an outrageous bang . It was the screen door . " Oh , Howie . I thought you 'd gone to bed . "   The fat man loomed against the stars , blotting out the house next door . " I 've got to go out for a while , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You do n't mean you 're actually leaving your prisoner unguarded , Howie ! What 's come over you  --  an attack ( If faith ? " " Fox 'll be all right till I get back . " Ellery thought he smelled a sneer in those nasal tones , and he was puzzled . " You 're not afraid Bayard 'll escape , Howie ? " " Nope . " The fat man plodded down the porch steps . " But where are you bound for ? " Ellery called after him . " Home . " " Home ? " Ellery realized that he had never pictured Detective Howie in the conventional garments of life . And yet it was true  --  the man lived in Wrightsville ; he must have a home . Somehow he could not visualize Detective Howie 's home . " Will you be gone long ? " The thin voice winged back . " An hour , maybe two . My wife 's got some fresh laundry for me . I ai n't had a change since I came on this case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat man had a wife who washed his socks and ironed his underwear ! Was he father to children , too ? " This case , " Ellery thought with a chuckle , " is certainly full of surprises . " He was about to toss his last cigaret away and get out of the slide-swing to stretch and yawn before turning in , when he heard a rush of feet and the screen door flew open again . " Mr. Queen ? " It was Linda , and in the starshine her face was marbled and old with contortion . " Linda . What 's the matter ? " " Davy . Upstairs . I 've had to lock him in . Please  --  " And she was gone . Ellery raced after her into the house . P205Davy ? Again ? Ellery reached the first-floor landing to find Linda at her husband'sdoor , a key in her hand . " Let 's not make any more noise than we can help , " she whispered . " Daddy Tal and Mother are asleep , and I do n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the key from her . Davy was perched on the edge of the tester bed , calmly enough . His hands , however , were deep in the pockets of his tunic . " You should n't have done that , Linny , " he said . " The guy deservesit . You know he does . " Linda looked scared . " Mr. Queen , Davy was going to . . . to kill that detective ! " " I was going to teach the hog a lesson . " Ellery said : " Howie ? " and recalled the sneer in the fat man 's voice . " What 's the matter , Davy ? " " He ca n't do that to my father . Jailbird or no jailbird . This is a house , with people in it , not a damned prison ! My dad 's a broken man . Anyone with two eyes can see that . He would n't pull anything . Howie 's got no right , Mr. Queen ! " " What 's the fellow done , Davy ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Davy . Davy . " Ellery regarded them both with a great tenderness . Then he said , " Wait here for me , " and he went out , being careful to lock Davy 's door behind him . He strode down the hall to the door of the south room . He tried the knob ; the door was not locked . Frowning , he knocked lightly . After a moment , Bayard 's voice , sounding very strange , said : " Come in . " Ellery went in , shutting the door behind him . The room was dark , and for a few seconds he saw nothing . Then as his eyes accommodated themselves to the darkness he made out Bayard 's frail figure on the old-fashioned iron double bed , outstretched and relaxed . In fact , Bayard 's arms were over his head , grasping the low headrail in an attitude of utter restfulness.
