txt The City Council acted with haste yesterday to pass a local law to impose the 5 per cent tax on pari-mutuel betting at race tracks within the city as authorized last week by the Legislature . This is one of four new taxes obtained by Mayor O'Dwyer to balance his first budget . The reason for the speed was a stake of $61,000 a day in tax lost for every day the law is not in effect after the opening of the racing season at Jamaica on Saturday . Acting not too secretively behind closed doors at the other end of City Hall , Thomas L. J. Corcoran , the Mayor 's legislative representative at Albany , and Magistrate Charles F. Murphy , the Mayor 's legal secretary , were intent on drafting the local laws for the new tax of 5 per cent on hotel rooms costing more than $2 rented to transients , and the doubling of the present 1 per cent sales tax and tax on business enterprises . Taxes Expected by Next Month It seemed evident that these bills would be submitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Estimate , approved by the Mayor and become effective at least by next month . Their estimated yield for two months would be 59,360,000 . Together the four taxes would yield a tidy $9,500,000 , and thus more or less make up the difference between the estimate of a 578,000,000 yield when the taxes were being tossed about by the Assembly , and the $67,000,000 estimated for them in the Mayor 's executive budget of $857,131,849 , made public Monday . It had been assumed that the taxes would go into effect with the new budget , but Mayor O'Dwyer , hard pressed for funds to make up deficiencies in the inherited current budget , apparently has no intention to waste time . The race track betting tax will be up for a public hearing before the Council 's Finance Committee on Friday at noon , with the Council scheduled to meet in special session at 1:30 to pass it , and the Board of Estimate due to meet later the same afternoon for the same purpose . The Mayor must advertise the law for five days , not counting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 11 . He will sign it the same day , and on Friday the city will be taking a 5 per cent share out of the parimutuel pool at the Jamaica track . Of the 189 days in the New York racing season this summer , twentyfour will be at Saratoga and 165 at New York City tracks . With the Empire City track closed , the Empire races will be run at Jamaica . With this tax estimated to yield $10,000,000 , the daily average would be 561,000 . The city will get a full 5 per cent on the parti-mutuel play at Jamaica and Aqueduct , and onefourth of the 5 per cent on the play at Belmont , with the remaining three fourths going to Nassau County , as that track lies partly in that county . Provisions of the Law On the collection and payment of the tax , the law provides as follows : " a . Before distributing the sums in pari-mutuel pools to the holders of the winning tickets , the racing corporation or association shall retain sufficient moneys from such pools for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax so imposed shall be paid by the racing corporation or association to the city treasurer , daily after each day of each race meeting , by depositing it to the account of the city in such bank or banks as may be designated by the city in accordance with the provisions of Section 421 of the New York City Charter , or at such regular intervals as the Controller and Treasurer may require . " b .

Officers of the racing corporation or association shall be personally liable for the tax retained or required to be retained hereunder . " The law requires every racing corporation or association conducting pari-mutuel betting at tracks in the city to file before any race meeting a surety bond as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment of the taxes " and/or " any penalties and interest . It requires each corporation to make a daily report , or as often as specified . Under penalties , it provides that any person failing to file a return or to pay - over any tax to the treasurer as required shall be subject to a penalty of 5 per cent of the amount of tax due , plus 1 per cent interest for each month of delay after the first month . Any corporation or official making or causing to be . filed a false return ; failing to file a bond or provide data required , will be guilty oft'a misdemeanor and subject to a fine up to $1,000 or imprisonment of up to one year , or both . Curb on Home-Razing Urged A resolution introduced by Vice Chairman Joseph T. Sharkey urging the Mayor , the Board of Estimate , the City Construction Coordinator and all departments to defer any post-war public improvements that involve demolition of residential buildings except in cases where the improvements " are absolutely emergent " was adopted unanimously by the Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The resolution was introduced as a substitute for several similar resolutions that related to specific projects , chiefly proposed highways in the Bronx , Brooklyn and Queens . The new resolution pointed out that many of the projects on the city 's post-war program would necessitate the demolition of residential buildings , and that " because of the present acute housing shortage in the city it will be impossible to relocate the evicted tenants in adequate housing accommodations , which will cause extreme hardship and discomfort to these evicted tenants , many of them returning service men . " While Councilman Joseph J. Hennessy , Democrat , of Queens , voted for the resolution , he pointed out that in the clearing of the right of way for Van Wyck Boulevard from  --  Hillside Avenue in Jamaica to Idlewild Airport 350 houses must be moved and of these 300 have already been moved to new sites , with preference to tenants or owners for first occupancy . Commissioner Robert Moses , the city 's Construction Coordinator , refused to comment on the measure . He is working out a priority list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to announce in about two weeks . Schick Seeks Ferryboats Councilman Frederick Schick of Staten Island , long admired by Council observers for his silent efficiency , broke into an indignant speech when Stanley Isaacs of Manhattan objected to voting on a Schick resolution urging the Mayor and the Board of Estimate to arrange for the manufacture and purchase of five new ferryboats for the service between Manhattan and Staten Island . Mr. Isaacs said that he did not want to vote because the Councilman from Staten Island had offered no evidence to support his statements that the present service was inadequate and unsafe . Whereupon Mr. Schick rose from his front row seat and said : " I 'd like to anslyer Mr. Isaacs on the proposition . The State Island ferries returned a profit of $1 , - 000,000 last year . Lots , of the city 's services are losing propositions . We of Staten Island belong to the city . The borough , one of the oldest in the city , is the Borough of Heavens . Why , 52 per cent of the ammunition and supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built there during the period of our great Mayor John F. Hylan at a cost of only $30,000,000 , piers that today would cost a billion . Why not make bridges and subways self-sustaining by putting a tax or raising the fare on them ? " A grand jury found the ferries to be unsafe to ride on . We need the new ferries . The present ones should be used only for vehicular traffic . " Mr. Sharkey and other Councilmen rallied to Mr. Schick 's support with open admiration . Louis P. Goldberg of Brooklyn declared , " I have been won over by the speech of Mr. Schick . " Charles E. Keegan of the Bronx , saying it was Mr. Schick 's maiden speech in nine years , added he consequently t000k great pleasure in voting for the resolution . Nineteen voted for it , while two voted in the negative and one refrained from voting .
