The fate of the world most assuredly depended on the U.S. economy . That freewheeling , capitalist machine whizzed along raucously . But even the most inexpert mechanic could detect portentous coughs and burps . Was the machine overheating ? Last week the machine 's most sensitive gauge-prices-continued to creep up the dial . <P> Prices terrified the Administration , which urged consumers to curtail their buying . Prices chilled some Republicans , who feared for their political necks . Prices had the average housewife mumbling like a woman in a bad dream . <P> The Happy Farmer . The dream was real . And the prices of food were the most haunting of all . Butter in New York sold for 87 ( 59 last September ) . Prime ribs of beef sold for 77 ( 50 last September ) . Eggs sold for 90 ( 65 last September ) . <P> And no one , not even the harassed consumer , according to a Gallup poll , expected those levels to hold . As wholesale food prices continued to soar ( the price index was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and steers reached new alltime highs , as wheat hit a seasonal price record , retail prices would follow like a comet 's tail . Butter , dealers said , would soon reach $1 a pound ( it already had , on the Pacific coast ) . Eggs would reach $1 a dozen . Steak was already $1 a pound in New York , where restaurateurs discussed taking most meat off their menus . <P> The only people who were happy about it were the farmers , whose cash receipts were $17.4 billion in the first eight months of this year , 21% higher than the same period last year , when their income was at a record . But even for the farmers happiness might be mostly a delusion . In Iowa they were having to pay as high as $2,900 for a Chevrolet in an automobile black market which had also skyrocketed . <P> <P> A Brief Relief . The inflationary pressures came from all sides . Wages were still on the rise . Last week 's biggest raise - 15 an hour- went to one million non-operating railroad workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Express Agency workers . The railroads , which had asked for a 16% boost in freight rates , promptly raised their request to 27% . Another inflationary factor was the Administration food-export program . According to Washington economists , the index of food prices rises 17 points every time the U.S. sends $500 million worth of food abroad . <P> One segment of U.S. society saw a chance for some brief relief . The day came last week when World War II veterans could cash their terminal leave bonds . They stormed the banks , which cashed about $100 million the first day . The veterans wanted money , they said , chiefly to pay their bills . The first stampede dwindled off , but by week 's end the veterans had cashed more than 23% of the $1.8 billion in bonds which the Government is holding for them . The conversion of $420 million into spending money would of itself increase the inflationary pressure .
