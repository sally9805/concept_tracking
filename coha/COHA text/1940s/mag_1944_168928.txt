Mitsuye Endo is a loyal U.S. citizen , born 24 years ago in Sacramento . Her eyes happen to slant upward because her ancestors were Japanese . In 1942 , when the U.S. Army uprooted 110,000 people of Japanese blood from their truck gardens and berry patches along the West Coast , Mitsuye Endo landed in a War Relocation center at Topaz , Utah . <P> This week the Supreme Court of the U.S. unanimously agreed that Citizen Endo - and , by implication , any other loyal Japanese-American-has a right to live where she pleases . Justice Frank Murphy denounced " the unconstitutional resort to racism inherent in the entire evacuation program . " But the court , frankly avoiding a tough constitutional issue in wartime , almost contradicted itself . <P> Tackling the case of another relocated Japanese-American , the Justices ruled , 6-to-3 , that the Army had had a right to evacuate all Japanese and Nisei in a time of national emergency . Said the court : " Exclusion of large groups of citizens from their homes ... is inconsistent with our basic Government institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> For almost two years , the right of the Government to shuffle citizens around at will had been a burning constitutional issue . But by the time the Supreme Court ruled this week , the question was academic . Day before , the Army had rescinded its mass evacuation order , told the loyal Japanese and Nisei they could return . Invasion , the Army explained , is no longer " a substantial possibility . " <P> Interior Secretary Harold Ickes soothingly promised Westerners that there would be " no hasty mass movement " of returning evacuees . But the difficulties of readjustment loomed large enough to give pause to all citizens of good will . Problems had already cropped up : <P> In Hood River , Ore . ( pop . 3.280 ) , American Legionnaires daubed paint on their servicemen 's honor roll to obliterate the names of 16 Nisei soldiers . <P> At Brawley , Calif. , 3,500 citizens jammed onto the high-school athletic field for an anti-Japanese mass meeting , listened to an orator scream : " Do you want these yellow-bellied sneaks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ! " <P> In Parker , Ariz. ( pop . 456 ) , Andy Hale put a sign in his barbershop : " Japs Keep Out You Rats , " ejected Raymond Matsuda , a Nisei veteran , wounded in Italy . . These were isolated instances , in small communities . But most of the U.S. Japanese on the West Coast lived in such small towns . And in the larger cities , the Hearst press kept up its anti-Japanese screams . California 's Governor Warren , setting the tone for the vast majority of West Coast citizens , promised every effort to keep the return of the Nisei orderly .
