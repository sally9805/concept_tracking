txt HOUSE APPROVES OPA BILL , 355 TO 42 , AS PROTESTS MOUNT 205 Democrats Vote for Revised Measure Which Bowles and Porter Call ' Impossible ' MURRAY URGES CIO ACTION Truman 's Comments Are ' Not for Print , ' but He Hopes for Better Results From Senate By JOHN D. MORRIS SPOCal to THE NEW YOLK Thszs . WASHINGTON , April 18 -- The House formally passed the muchamended bill to extend price con trol today , 355 to 42 , while protests increased over its action yes- ; I terdav in rewriting the measure . Paul Porter , Price Administrator , asserted that two of the amendments would make price control " impossible " and four or five of the others would add " billions " to the cost of living . Chester Bowles , Stabilization Director , who conferred for thirtyfive minutes with President Truman , also called the House bill " impossible . " When Charles G. Ross , White House secretary , was asked whether Mr. Truman had any comment on the House 's action , he replied : " Not for print . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything about it , Mr. Ross said : " He hopes for much better results in the Senate . " Philip Murray , president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations , meanwhile sent telegrams to all affiliated unions urging " drastic action " to undo what he said was the damage done by the House . Veteran Conference Is Urged The American Veterans Committee asked Mr. Truman to veto " any OR.A. bill including inflationary amendments " and urged him to call a conference of all veterans ' groups " to show the stake which the veteran has in keeping down prices and avoiding a disastrous inflation . " The House passed the bill after defeating a motion by Representative Rankin , Democrat , of Mississippi , to send it back to committee . The proposal of Mr. Rankin , an opponent of any extension , was rejected , 370 to 20 . The bill was approved by the votes of 205 Democrats , 148 Republicans and two minor party members . Eight Democrats and thirty-four Republicans voted against it . Before the roll-call was taken , Representative Sabath , Democrat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OPA ! " The Lwo amendments which Mr. Porter said would make price control " impossible " were the Gossett decontrol provision and the Wolcott cost-plus amendment . The Gossett amendment would require elimination of price control over commodities when their production for a twelve-month period reached the level of the peak year , July 1 , 1940 , to June 30 , 1941 . Would Guarantee a Profit The Wolcott provision would guarantee cost plus a " reasonable profit " to producers and handlers of every commodity . It appeared that under the Gossett amendment , Mr. Porter said , the OPA would have to remove ceilings on commodities making up at least half the items on the costof-living list while " supply is still far out of balance with demand . " Among them , he added , are meats , milk and nearly all dairy products , except butter , coal , shoes , wool and rayon textiles and women 's and children 's garments made from wool and rayon . He said that the amendment would also require the lifting of ceilings from most farm products and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , textiles , leather , rubber , chemicals , coke , stone and glassware . Mr. Porter 's reasons why the Wolcott cost - plus amendment mould destroy price control were as follows : " It would blow sky-high the ceilings on automobiles , electric reE'rigerators , radios and most housegold a2pliances , whose producers mist undergo a period of temporarily high cost before their mitput hits high mass-production evels " It wculd start a spiral of need ( ss price and cost increases by ' lling OPA to boost ceilings or the vast number of low-profit tems which , along with high-profit tems , prosperous industries and // trades have always made and sold . " With no product - by - product cost and profit figures available for 85 per cent of American business firms , OPA could not carry out the countless cost accounting studies necessary to apply this amendment . No Government agency could hope to meet the utterly impossible administrative burden . " Mr. Porter said another Wolcott amendment to eliminate subsidies by the end of this year under a rigid schedule calling for 25 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rises , " would destroy all hope of working out an ordinary program to minimize the shock of simultaneous subsidy termination and ceiling price increases . " The OPA , he added , " could not prevent scandalous windfall profits to speculators who , after getting the Government payments on subsidized products , would hold the products in inventory until they could get price increases too . " The Flannagan amendment to forbid the payment of any subsidy on meat products " would do more than add the amount of the subsidy to the cost of meat , " Mr. Porter said . " It would destroy the only effective method which OPA can use to control live animal prices . " Mr. Bowles , after conferring with Mr. Truman , refused to say whether he would resign if the bill were enacted in its present form . He added , however , that he did not see " what could be done " to maintain price controls under it . He said that he could not say whether there was any discussion with the President of a veto . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Price control would be impossible as the bill stands now . " Mr. Murray 's telegrams called on all CIO members , through their locals and industrial union councils , to rally the people of their communities in a mass expression of support for price control and for those members of Congress who voted to maintain it . Asserting that the House majority " betrayed the American people " by passing " crippling " amendments , he asked union members to appeal to , their Senators in Washington and their representatives at home during the House 's Easter recess " to protect us from disastrous inflation . " In a letter asking Mr. Truman to veto the bill if it came to him in its present form , Chat Paterson , legislative representative of the American Veterans Committee , asserted that veterans ' benefits would be meaningless if Congress crippled the price control program . He then asked : " What good are disability pensions , business loans , living allowances for education , terminal leave pay and other veterans ' preferences if the veteran ca n't buy anything with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
