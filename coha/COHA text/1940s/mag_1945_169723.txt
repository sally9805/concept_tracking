Platoon Sergeant Charles Henry Smith , U.S.M.C. , can go back to civilian life any time he wants . He has 232 points , three campaign ribbons with 17 Pacific battle stars and a chestful of decorations , including the Navy Cross . He also carries 39 pieces of shrapnel , a Jap bullet in his shoulder and another in his spine . But this week , as the Marine Corps celebrated its 170th birthday , indestructible , 27-year-old Sergeant Smith was glad to tell reporters that he was not going to be a civilian . He is a professional marine . <P> Older professionals , getting near retirement , heard what he had to say with approval . As it had from the day it was founded ( Nov. 10 , 1775 ) , the Corps would need noncoms like Smith to keep the outfit going . Smith was 16 when he shipped in the Marine Corps . He was a husky , competent corporal of 22 when he heard his first shot fired in anger . That was at Pearl Harbor . Charles Henry Smith was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy struck . On the double at the proper command , he manned his antiaircraft gun . <P> On that Sunday morning his wife was killed on Ford Island by a Jap aerial gunner . <P> Marine Smith sailed south on the Lexington , was aboard her when she was sunk in the Coral Sea . Rescued and taken back to Pearl Harbor , he was put aboard the North Carolina . Then he got shore duty , and became a member of Carlson 's Raiders . <P> The Raiders . He stormed ashore with them on Makin Island , killed one Jap with his rifle butt in hand-to-hand combat . The Raiders went on to Guadalcanal and there , during Carlson 's famous 30-day patrol behind enemy lines , among other feats Smith knocked out two machine-gun nests and choked one Jap to death . Willing to volunteer for anything , he served a tour as an aerial gunner ( " I was n't doing anything at the time " ) and shot down two planes . <P> He went home after that for a breather , met and married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the South Pacific , fighting in Abemama and Majuro , and in the Marshall Islands , where he was wounded by a Jap hand grenade . <P> In the Marshalls one night , Marine Smith found himself with two comrades in a foxhole within earshot of the enemy . In Japanese , he invited confused Jap soldiers to join him . One after another , four of them crawled over ; Smith quietly bayoneted them to death . Smith 's friends left for another foxhole . Said he : " I guess they thought I was crazy . " <P> At Tinian he and Pfc . Al Shirley , of Los Angeles , made an unauthorized patrol ahead of advancing tanks to defuse land mines . They captured a machine gun , turned it on the enemy and killed 19 . Pfc . Shirley used a whole clip from a Browning automatic rifle to knock down a Jap before the machine gun was taken . For such waste , Sergeant Smith gave him a good dressing-down . <P> Marine Smith fought on at Peleliu , was shipped back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again for the Leyte and Luzon campaigns . He was sent home to California ( " They said I was tired and worn out " ) but he got back in time for the Okinawa campaign and the last days of the war .
