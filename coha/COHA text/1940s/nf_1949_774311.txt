txt  | Balance ? rest through equal , but not necessarily the same , amounts of interest on each side of a center . Rhythm ? movement that is smooth , subtle , even lively , but gliding and orderly . Emphasis ? dominance of a part with subordination of others . In judging a dress design consider the structural over-all design ? its silhouette ( outward shape ) and the shapes or lines within ; and last , consider the decorative features , details , which must be related to the structure . In using the principles you will find them interrelated . All are involved in each and every design . THE PRINCIPLE OF HARMONY Harmony in any design produces a feeling of unity ( oneness ) without monotony by having more elements of likeness than unlikeness . This principle infers repetition , but not exact repetition , of line , shape , form , size , texture , value , hue , intensity of color and feeling or idea ; it implies that some contrast be provided to relieve monotony but that too many accents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the law of unity with variety . Lack of order , neatness , cleanliness creates more or less confusion that interferes with complete unity . An amateurish misconception of harmony is the idea of a perfect match ; try to outgrow this idea by selecting related items rather than exact repeats . The following applications illustrate the use of the principle of harmony . The silhouette of a costume , no matter what style , should be more revealing of one 's natural body contour than it is hooped , bustled or bloused if it is a full or bell-shaped style ; thus , a bustle effect can be good design only if properly subordinated . The silhouette should definitely relate to points of movement or natural body division lines but should not be too snug fitting , if sheath or tubular style . Larger areas should have much in common ; the smaller the accent used the greater the contrast can be . Irregular features or body proportions may be modified in effect through concealment by a loose , flowing or full silhouette : avoid a tight fitting jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not well proportioned . Bouffant styles add width but in moderation may camouflage : peplums and slight gathers at the waistline conceal a prominent abdomen .  | Structural seam lines should be closely related to the natural location of such body features as waistlines , necklines and the hinges joining the arms to the shoulders . Departures are often uncomfortable , slip out of place or destroy the natural body proportions . Much skill is required to bring the complete design back into balance : the long torso style of the 1920 's frequently divided the design into equal oblongs and revealed the knees ; the 1950 designs improved the idea by suggesting the normal waistline with halfbelts , and fitted underarm seams , and by slightly lengthening the skirts . Off-the-shoulder armholes in a blouse a size too large are messy and disturbing , while armholes fitting the normal armscye curve always satisfy . An off-the-shoulder design in a party dress , definitely below the normal armscye , is satisfying if it is done intentionally to harmonize with some other graceful curve , but disturbing if the skirt yoke employs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and balloonish if the skirt is full and the bodice and sleeves bloused or puffed ? too much repetition ; the addition of a flared shorty jacket would offer too much bulk . Variety in size and shape with more relationship to the body results from a snug bodice with the full skirt , or a slim skirt with the full blouse ; these are more or less standard favorite combinations that have pleased over the years . Similarly a flared shorty ( jacket ) would look better with the slim skirt . A short box coat would look well over either costume , as it offers a transition in size , shape , and line : this is why it is always listed as a fashion classic . Thus transitions whether of line , value . color or texture make for harmony . Hair styles , hats , collars , necklines are most harmonious if they follow the natural shape of the head and face but not exactly repeat ( too monotonous ) . The deviation should provide an interesting graceful transition without contradicting or too much contrast . Unbeautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too long page boy styles , straggly locks , over-curled styles . A very wide brimmed hat is too far removed from a small face ; a round face looks rounder with a round collar or a round hat ? too much repetition emphasizes ; likewise a stiff straight pill box would emphasize by contrast . Her choice should be a hat with a soft brim and upward tilt not a sharp angle ( transition not contrast ) . This principle is used to correct irregular features . The oval face  | is the ideal : if one has a long face with pointed chin , large nose , high forehead , wearing a stiff pompadour would be going in the wrong direction ? soft bangs , a soft brush back , and soft side waves would correct the difficulty and soften , even , the impression of a stern personality . Lines within the silhouette are created by seams , darts , hems , and decorative details . good lines are smooth , accurate , graceful ? whether on the silhouette or within it i Irregular sloppy hemlines are out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrinkles destroy harmony . If your hip silhouette is not a smooth flowing single curve but bumpy , correct it by a girdle so the lines ar as direct as those drawn by a fine artist . Fabrics with definite straight line patterns as stripes , plaids , shantungs are more pleasing made up in a design with predominatingly straight lines and shapes as yokes , collars , pockets ; curved I patterns in prints are more harmonious in curved shapes as yokes or puffed sleeves . But each needs some transitional effect or subordinate contras-perhaps a square collar with rounded lapels , or , on a tailored jacket , the lower center front in a slight curve . Overuse f square corners makes the design seem amateurish . Vertical lines and shapes give strength and because the eye is led up and down tend to slenderize . Use horizontal lines and shapes where you need width : wide belts do not slenderize ; broad collars accent shoulders ( good to balance wide hips ) . Curved lines and shapes giving the effect of roundness and a softer more feminine feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something with something and are good harmonizers , especially if slightly elliptical instead of yardstick straight . Harmony of color in a costume requires that one hue be predominating with some interesting , controlled differencgSelection of a basic color theme provides harmony in the larger pieces . Selection of a family of related cool ( or warm ) colors because the wearer is a cool ( or warm ) type is another step in color harmony . A complete outfit of navy blue is obviously monotonous ( if the same hue , value , intensity ) ; a subtle , restrained effect is achieved if the blouse is a powdered blue ; or one part a strong contrast in texture ( satin with linen ) ; or one part a small accent in change of value as white gloves ; or two accents of yellow-orange as a gold brocade vest with beige gloves . If the yellow accents are related to the larger family  | of related well-liked colors the accents just mentioned may be interchanged with other parts of the wardrobe such as a beige flannel skirt and cardigan sweater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too much contrast for the suit but not for the sweater outfit . Harmony of texture ( page 119 ) gives us the key as to what is appropriate for different times of day or occasioU Fabric texture should be in harmony with the use ; thus we coo not accept satin for a sport shirt . Fine textures belong together ? even for accent we do not long enjoy such extremes of contrast as tweed with organdy , sequins on gingham , pearls on denim , though there be such a fad . We enjoy some contrast as linen with organdy , velvet with satin but we prefer velveteen with cotton broadcloth . Choosing most of our textures in the middle range provides safe mixing , with an occasional texture at either end of the scale ? coarse or fine ? for intere t . Harmony of idea is based on related uses , personalities ? the eternal fitness of things . This does not mean that an embroidered horse 's head on a riding skirt , sunflowers on a sun dress , or skillets on a kitchen apron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tweed skirts , silk negligees do not belong in the kitchen ; nor a heavy sweater , heavy shoes and a jockey cap at church or a tea ; nor blue jeans on a dainty , sweet , clean baby . Gay colors , bouffant . lines are associated in one 's thinking with parties not church . THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTION In attaining unity with variety we need some help in knowing how far to go in amounts of contrast or differences in shapes , sizes , and color . The Greek law of space divisions is particularly helpful , i.e. , a space divided in the proportion of 2:3 or 3:5 is more pleasing than 2:2 or 3:6 . A satisfying proportion exists if the smaller part is to the larger part as the larger is to the total , as 3:5 : : 5:8 . These are only approximate ideas which would be varied as values ( light and dark ) are changed . The following are but a few applications . The line for a yoke is more pleasing if it does not divide the blouse either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between these . A jacket is more becoming if it is not the same length  | as the skirt showing below ; it is more becoming with the skirt showing more length on the short girl and less length on the tall girl . Try the Greek law on B , Figs. 20 , 21 and 22 . Stripes in a fabric are more pleasing if not the same width throughout especially if a striking intensity or value contrast of color . They might be equally spaced if all are soft , or dark , or of several related colors . In arranging buttons or tucks it is more individual and interesting to use odd numbers rather than even . If they are to appear as units , keep the spaces wider than the objects . If several tucks are to be grouped as one unit the space between the individual tucks should be less than the width of a tuck and the space between the groups of these tucks each should be less than the width of the three-tuck unit . Try the Greek proportions . The tiers in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of equal depths with equal amounts of trimming . It would be better proportioned to have graduated tiers with the same decoration on each ; or equal tiers with graduated decoration on each ; or graduated decoration on graduated tiers . Different rectangles or shapes are formed in a dress design by extending or by dividing the silhouette . The height of the total design is apparently raised if several tall narrow panels are created ; the width is increased and the height decreased if a crosswise line as yoke or waist divides the large oblong into two almost square shapes . Thus , a stocky figure appears less wide if vertical space divisions are used . The tall girl should use the Greek proportions in planning a long torso design ( Fig. 22 ) . Scale refers to the relationship in size between a part and the whole . A large overstuffed chair is out of proportion in a small room . Similarly a large purse is out of scale for a small girl ; or a dainty purse or hat on a woman of large build and face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or intensity the more care that must be exercised when making space divisions . THE PRINCIPLE OF BALANCE Balance is the restful effect obtained by grouping shapes and colors to maintain a feeling of equal attraction ( equilibrium ) from side to side , front to back , or top to bottom . ? The natural center of interest that already exists in the body  | above the mechanical middle should be maintaine ( Exaggerated bustles or front drapery , may destroy this as does an excess of hat and furs above the waistline . A costume with small and simple bodice is often balanced by a full skirt ( much area ) with a beautiful flow of line and decorative accents around the hem line . A small accent will probably be required near the face to balance this inequality in weight or area . The lower part of the composition should have a feeling of weight by use of dark values " below , light above : shoes darker than the costume are better than lighter ones would be . A broad hat , not a tiny pill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide hips and a flared skirt . The sheath style dress is best balanced at the top with a large bow at the neckline , a cape collar , a bateau neckline , a bolero , bloused back , or soft Empire bloused top , a fur piece and a small hat , or no fur piece with a medium large hat ( Figs. 28 , and 34 , p. 183 ) . Formal balance gives a feeling of neatness , strength , straightforwardness ; thus it seems fitted to tailored clothes and the businesslike person Informal balance is not so easy to achieve or analyze ; it is softer , more graceful due to transitional lines suited to gay dramatic moods . Balance in color is best obtained by observing the Law of Areas : large areas of color should be quiet in effect while contrasts used must be in smaller amounts ; the larger the area is the quieter it should be , the smaller the area the more contrasting it may be . Contrast may be created by a change of hue , value ( dark and light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Echoing a color is repeating it in a smaller or weaker amount to achieve balance . THE PRINCIPLE OF RHYTHM Rhythm is a smooth related movement . Pattern and line carry the eyes along without jerky motion . The eye automatically connects points in space ; if there are a good many spots not in a direct flowing direction or too far apart , the eyes may jump , but if the spots are not too dominant the eyes may go on to the next smoothly . White ear rings , white collar , white belt , white buttons worn with a red dress and white shoes and gloves will cause a jerky eye movement sometimes described as a " spotty " design . It lacks rhythm . Regular repetition of shapes like ruffles and rows of buttons make  | for smoothness of eye movement . Steps or gradation of sizes suggests the unique possibility of using horizontal lines or spaces like a ladder to achieve a vertical impression ( of greater height on a short figure ) . The individual design in lace and all-over prints is most pleasing if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gradation of sizes . Transitional lines and shapes that do not show strong value contrasts are preferable to conspicuous angles and zigzag movements . THE PRINCIPLE OF EMPHASIS Emphasis is the design principle by which the eye is led first to the most important part and then to other parts and details in order of their importance . In good dress designing we lead the eye to the most important feature usually the face and stress it if it is oval ; or we minimize features that are undesirable ; or we detract from features not so favorably proportioned . Repetition and extreme contrast both emphasize : a tall thin girl should avoid extremely large or extremely small hats and hair styles . A blonde is enhanced by wearing a dark value next to her hair . Pretty ankles are emphasized by pretty shoes or details around the hem line of the skirt . A long torso line will accent wide hips . A square jaw and broad shoulders are accented by square necks , high yokes , shoulder pads . Buttondown-the-front dresses and narrow panels keep the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unbroken lines from  | shoulder to hem keep eyes away from the waistline ; darts in bodice matching gore lines in skirt do the same . Radiating lines ( darts ) at neckline attract attention to the face . Triangles are employed to lead the eye to areas needing emphasis and away from undesirable features . The eye finds the wide end of the triangle a stable base on which to rest so the wide part makes the design look wider there . A skirt too narrow at the bottom makes wide hips look wider ; a flared skirt with the base of the triangle clown seems more balanced and keeps the hips from looking so wide . If your hips are wide you may also place the base of the triangle up at the shoulder to emphasize it and minimize the hips ( Fig. 19 ) . An object gains emphasis if given enough plain space for a background ; a beautiful lace collar is lost on a printed dress ; jewelry , veils , flowers , are not effective on prints . A plaid coat must be reserved for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SPECIAL PROBLEMS The short , tiny type of girl often with a flat chest and thin arms , needs a trim-fitted waistline , a full skirt ; accents to broaden the shoulders ; fullness to give the effect of rounded bust ; small collars , wide but shallow yokes ( Fig. 20 ) . She likes the fitted bodice and dirndl skirt but should not have the fitted bodice too snug . A princess style needs widening at the shoulder with a yoke , narrow round collar , or ruffles ; too severe , it may accent the very features she wishes to subdue . She should avoid close-fitting , clinging styles , intricate cuts or many crosswise lines such as tiers , or peplums , wide belts , and large-scale features such as fox furs , or bulky purses . Becoming are fill sleeves , long sleeves , or any style that " builds her out " ? flared collars or sash tie-belts . She should avoid fitted coats but favor a bolero jacket or a box coat . Details should be scaled to her size , but too dainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl should aim at the inconspicuous costume , with accents on her most attractive features and inside the silhouette . Lengthwise and diagonal lines are flattering ( Fig. 21 ) . She must avoid both too snug and too full , bunchy , bulky areas . She requires narrow panels or gores , soft and neat fullness such as groups of pleats or flare in the skirt rather than a gathered skirt .  | Figure Flare at the lower skirt balances width of bust , hips , or waist and gives a youthful swing to her dress . She must avoid yokes , flounces , peplums , off-the-shoulder effects , wide flowing sleeves , cuffs . She looks well in coat styles , redingotes , button-down-the-front styles , and narrow self belts . She should look for half-size or custom-size patterns and garments . She looks best with normal armholes , and skirts not too short . In coats , a straight-line , single-breasted Chesterfield is more flattering than a princess cut . If a princess style is chosen , it must be only semifitted . If she has a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wide or stand-up collars . Cardigan styles are very good for her . If she has heavy hips or thighs , she should not wear a suit with a fitted jacket or snug skirt . She looks better in a short semifitted jacket , or a bolero so that the length of the skirt showing will make her appear tall ; a three-quarter topper conceals the hips , but it should not flare . She needs heavy fabrics that fall into nice lines . She should avoid clinging lightweight fabrics , loud prints or bright colors , and stiff , shiny fabrics . Contrasting blouse and skirt will make her look broader and shorter . Heavy jewelry , a medium large hat and a large but flat bag make her seem smaller by contrast ( Plate XIII ) . The full or broader figure should avoid too close or too loose cuts  | Figure ? a dirndl skirt , a peg-top skirt , a princess style , long full sleeves or wide flat hats . She needs long skirts cut in several gores or sections ; modified flares , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow collars , long V-necks , slight ease around the waist rather than basque-like darts ; three-quarter or long , straight sleeves ; diagonal lines , heavy fabrics and narrow belts . To avoid that buxom look , select simple styles , collarless styles , softly draped bodice , soft flare in skirts and dark jackets of boxy style . The tall , heavy-set girl must insist on simple lines ? semifitted , never fitted . Shoulders should be slightly extended and square but not square enough to give a " football-player " effect . She should  | avoid fussy trims , puffed sleeves , and ordinary or bold prints , checks , plaids , fleece coats , bright colors , slacks . Sophisticated large scale or textured prints make good jacket dresses for spring ; dark colors and backgrounds are best . The tall , thin girl will look gawky in a garment that clings and is skimpy or overfitted ( Fig. 22 ) . She should avoid princess styles , Figure tight bodices , tight-fitting or very short sleeves , narrow skirts . Her height will be emphasized by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long torso designs , full skirts , peplums , flounces , frilly collars and bows , capes , two-piece effects , swagger coats , contrasting colors used horizontally , wide belts ; horizontal off-theshoulder lines , yokes , and insets ; double-breasted coats , broad shoulders , deep armholes , loosely cut elbow or three-quarter sleeves . If her neck is thin or long , she will prefer soft , full , or deep collars . If graceful , she can wear striking designs and colors . She can have  | large accessories , big bags . If very tall she looks well in shorter skirts , lower heels , hats with brims . With a flat bust , or hollow chest , use full peasant blouses or boleros , capes , and such decoration as pocket flaps , gathered , pleated , frilled fronts . Avoid princess cuts , flimsy fabrics or tightfitting blouses . With a large bust , avoid breast pockets , tight blouses ; select full skirts in pleated or dirndl style , short Eton jackets . If sweaters seem necessary , add a matching cardigan or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bust to conceal and to avoid tightness that reveals , but not enough to add extra bulk . Broad shoulders or a flaring hem line attract attention away from the bust . If you have round shoulders , work on your posture . Wear dresses with backs slightly bloused ( Fig. 23 ) , gathers at waistline , Eton jackets , small rolled collars . The shoulder seam should lie half an inch back of the highest shoulder point . With a sway back , never wear tight-fitting sweaters , bodices or princess styles but select bloused bodices , soft girdles or sashes tied at back , capes and jackets ending below the waistline ( Fig. 23 ) . Figure Peplums and gathered skirts are good . Corrective exercises for posture are most effective . With broad shoulders avoid narrow skirts , severe close-fitting necklines , broad hats . Balance shoulders with flared peplums or skirts , use V-necklines . With large hips , plan skirts with several gores with some flare at hem line to balance the hips , pleats at center , V-shaped skirt yoke , belt narrow to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and avoid bulky fullness and straight tubes . Have seams and darts of blouse  | enter waistline at right angles to match lines in skirt . Bolero jackets are good . Avoid tight belts , full sleeves or wide cuffs , circumference seams or decoration on the hip line , contrasting skirt and blouse . Full skirts , small hats , and narrow shoulders accent width of hips . Avoid resting your hands on your hips . If one hip is wider than the other , a peplum or fullness in the skirt may help to conceal ; a pocket or sash tied on the smaller side will balance . USING COLOR A young girl with a healthy complexion can wear almost any color in dress , especially if she uses make-up with judgment . But a few suggestions may help you to look still more attractive . Select a color because it is becoming to you ? not because " they " are wearing it . A becoming color is one that makes the skin look healthier and accents your best features . Even though a color such as pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it may not be practical to care for or it may be too noticeable to be worn often , or you may soon tire of it ; at least , choose a more neutral or less striking color for your basic wardrobe color ( page 68 ) . Then it may be combined with other less expensive or smaller articles in other gay or unusual colors . If the pink or lilac is becoming but too pretty or theatrical , use it for negligees . Study fashion magazines each season to see how the best designers combine colors . You will always find a number of outfits in which all the colors match or blend with the basic color . Then for dark costumes , often one accent is provided by adding either one brilliant or one pale color . It requires more skill to combine several colors . The unusual combinations of several colors beautifully portrayed in fashion magazines are beautiful because of the proportions , textures and workmanship employed . If you try to copy these ideas in cheap fabrics with little attention to details of construction or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabrics in simple patterns for beginners will produce happy results in simple color combinations like navy and red , brown and yellow , or gray and aqua , rather than in unusual combinations that would be pleasing to chiffons , good silks or soft woolens . Trying colors on yourself in a good light is the best method of determining their becomingness . If not particularly flattering but wearable , use a more becoming color near the face . Choose make-up to harmonize not only with the skin but also with the costume .  | A girl with quiet personality is eclipsed by large areas of bright color , but she appears washed out in drab , colorless outfits She should wear small amounts of strong colors , and seek subtle and interesting color combinations , ' While a girl with forceful personality and dashing manner can wear bright colors , she should not wear them on all occasions . It is easier to grasp the principles of using color if you will refer to the color wheel ( Fig. 24 ) you probably learned in grade school Figure in using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabrics on the table around a color wheel until you are skillful in recognizing the color name ( hue ) of many intermediates , even though they vary as to lightness or darkness ( value ) and brightness or grayness ( intensity ) . Cool colors are blues , greens , and violets . They are becoming to fair skins , blue-black hair , gray hair , and blue or gray eyes . Warm colors are those which contain much red or yellow such as orange , brown or henna . They are generally becoming to warm complexions and brown eyes . ' If your coloring is cool , use more cool colors . If your coloring is warm , select warm colors . If a cold color is used on a warm skin , it is more harmonious in darker values . If a warm  | color is used on a cool skin , it is more becoming in lighter values . Mark the side of the color wheel from which you will choose most of your colors and save the opposite side for accents or accessories . Cream or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strong colors are better than pale . Bright colors should not be too light . An olive skin is enhanced by soft , medium , or dark green ? not the cold blue-green but warm yellow-green . If the skin is reddish , ( florid ) , use black and dark , dull , warm colors . Blondes who are delicate in coloring need accenting and should avoid too pale or dull-looking colors . Cool pastels , black , bright blue are good . Blondes who have very bright golden hair ( arid ruddy complexion ) appear gaudy and hard in vivid colors like fuchsia or chartreuse ( shar-truz ) , they look better in grayed colors such as soft browns and dark colors like black , dark blue or dark green . Value contrasts in hats enhance the hair . The red-haired girl may need to tone down the brightness of her hair by using related colors like henna , apricot , bittersweet , yellow and brown . A warm green is gorgeous for her , perhaps too gorgeous unless subdued into olive , bronze and dark blue-green . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink are excellent for her . Kelly green and peacock blue are probably too cool in contrast for warm coloring ? often bleaching out the color of her face and emphasizing freckles . Other poor colors for her are orchid , purple , red , chartreuse , cerise and bright pink , especially when worn next to the face . Are you of medium coloring ? It is probably safer to use a combination of warm and cool in your costume , using chiefly colors that blend with the skin and the eyes ? with some dark values to contrast with the hair . Avoid wearing many neutral colors such as tan , gold or gray . Try soft blue-greens or soft corals . Select brown in preference to tan . Dark skins with dark hair look best in dark , rich colors . Pastels and blue-white should be avoided . Dark skins with weak coloring in hair and eyes look well in deep reds , medium dull green , beige ; black , white and beige need color accents added such as bright red or coral . The rule is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to emphasize the suntan of health ? then use white and cool pastels . Girls with sallow skins should avoid tan , gray , yellow , yellowgreen and purple . They look well in henna , red-brown , rich ma-  | hogany , dull blue , blue-green and green , if cool in type . Overly red , florid complexions are subdued by warm colors , grayed and darkened . Eyes may be emphasized by wearing a bit of the same , but not brighter , color near the face . Dull hair and sandy eyebrows need dark , clear colors in the hat or next to the face . Color and sheen in hair are enhanced by contrasting color . Light hair is emphasized by black or dark colors both in the dress and the hat , but may appear faded with bright , warm colors or the same color . The figure appears larger in white , bright colors and warm colors , especially red . Dark , dull , and cool colors like navy blue and black seem to slenderize stout figures . ( White and light colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recede . ) Large feet may be minimized by dark shoes in place of light ones . What Colors Go Together ? Using one color in various degrees of light and dark , or tints and shades , such as light blue with dark blue or beige with brown , is usually safe but sometimes monotonous . It may be difficult to find two blues that harmonize because one is a little blue-green and the other slightly blue-purple . As a rule do not combine white with a very dull color ; use it with brighter , clearer or darker tones . Colors that are next to each other on the color wheel ( Fig. 24 ) are related , as yellow , yellow-green and green . The more closely related the set of colors , the easier they are to use . Many lovely harmonies can be planned on such a theme . They are practically as easy and safe to use in a costume as one-color harmonies , and generally are more interesting . In the color wheel , colors opposite each other are called complements , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a costume are difficult to plan without special thought . Next to each other they appear brighter . If your skin is reddish , green will make it appear redder ; if sallow , violet and bright blue will bring out the yellow tones . If your green suit seems dull and drab use red in a scarf or lapel pin to brighten it . When combining colors , use more of one than the other ? not equal amounts . The larger area of the costume , the dress , coat or suit , should be dull with the brighter one in smaller areas such as the blouse or accessories . Do not repeat a contrasting bright color more  | than once or twice in the same costume and even then change it in tone and in area . Complementary colors are more pleasing if they are not direct opposites ? that is , if one is changed just a little in hue or color . For example , bright scarlet or fuchsia combined with soft , light yellow-green in a chiffon evening gown is more pleasing than plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more successfully for active sports , on beaches , at the country club , on summer picnics , or for evening affairs . Bright colors are not flattering next to the face . A certain blonde looked lovely in a gray dress with soft violet suede belt , lemon-gold costume jewelry and a soft brown fur coat . The next day she wore a chartreuse dress with a fuchsia sport coat that made her look cheap , gaudy , and artificial because the colors intensified not only the redness of her skin but the brassy effect of " bleached " hair . Bright colors are more interesting and less tiring if they are intermediates ? not obvious color wheel primaries or secondaries . Dull colors can be made to appear brighter by combining them with their complements . A gray-blue suit may look like a clear blue by using a yellow or yellow-orange scarf with it , but it will appear as gray or duller blue if the scarf is a bright blue . Similarly , undesirable colors are intensified by the use of complements . If your skin is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid green . Unusual combinations require clever use of textures : try olive , emerald , aquamarine , royal blue with orange or beige shoes ; navy blue , jade , and raspberry ; dark brown , olive green , grayed lime , clay red . Unsatisfactory color combinations sometimes seen are coral with bright henna or orange , orchid with orange ( red hair ! ) , brown with bright purple , scarlet with rose , flesh with henna , wine-red with tan ; orange make-up with purple , violet , or red . But neutral and : transition tones may bring those into harmony as seen in some . East Indian and South American textiles . In rich textures these colors may be effectively combined . Pastels are popular with college girls . Light pink and light blue in combination are particularly insipid . If the blue is deepened or enriched with violet , or changed to aquamarine and used with American beauty , or changed to royal blue and combined with flesh , it is lovely . Pink and light green are also unsatisfactory ; hence , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if  | the pink is converted into American beauty . It might be enhanced by a change in texture , such as a velvet bow or lace trim . Light colors are improved by combination with deeper values to give balance and proportion to the design . Pastels in wool dresses are particularly satisfactory when worn with dark fur coats . Pastel sweaters have more character with darker or brighter skirts than with pastel skirts , but beware of the sweater that sheds on a dark skirt . Baby blue is better for babies than for college girls unless strengthened by some darker or contrasting color . Color Names Since we do not all remember colors alike , artists usually describe colors in terms of hue ( location on color wheel ) , value ( light , medium , or dark ) , and intensity ( bright or dull ) . Fabric or yarn dyers follow names on the Standard Color Card . Fashion designers and advertisers use glamorous names . Peach-blossom on the Standard Color Card was called " Stifled Sigh Pink " by one designer . In the art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow-red . TEXTURE , A BASIS FOR COORDINATION Texture refers to the surface appearance of the fabric , plus its characteristic body or hang , plus the feel of it . We know how it feels even if we do n't touch it ? it is rough or smooth , dull or glossy , soft or harsh , stiff or limp , thick or thin , , Other adjectives we use are furry , hairy , fuzzy , crisp , spongy , rich , sturdy , felted , cobwebby . These characteristics are created by different raw fibers such as cotton or rayon , by Yarns varied in size , ply , twist , uniformity or lack of uniformity such as fine crepe or loose boucle ; by various constructions ? knitted , felted , woven ? as in net or satin ; and by their surface finish as in napped , starched , embossed , mercerized and glazed fabrics . ' the different textures give a certain feeling of fitness to the wearer ? luxury ( swish and rustle ) , cleanliness ( crispness , smoothness ) or efficiency ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on others of bulk , grace , svelteness , fragility which must be considered in relation to one 's personality , one 's figure and the silhouette indicated by the pattern for making a dress ; Some textures have appropriate relation to the weather , climate , season which must be con-  | sidered in making practical combinations . Modern air conditioning , heating , transportation have modified some of our ideas , but the final costume should show dominance of one type of texture ? do n't let the fashion world rush you into widely unrelated combinations . ( Fads that break the rule may be fun but not art ! ) Leathers , fabrics , and accessories may be classified under three headings : ( 1 ) rough , harsh , heavy , dull , durable-looking , ( 2 ) medium , soft , dull , ( 3 ) fine , smooth , sheer , shiny .

Strive for enough contrast to secure interest , but those unexpected differences should not overbalance the similarity of weight and appearance .. In a chair , leather seems right with oak , but velvet would be too different . Pigskin 4gloves seem right with a tweed suit and oxfords , but too extreme in character to wear with a navy sheer and patent pumps . Corduroy and velveteen are too much alike to be interesting in a combination . Silver and gold belong with satin , but copper and brass would be better with tweed or crash . With corduroy , a broadcloth shirt is better than an organdy blouse . With a flannel suit , a velveteen collar is preferable to one of velvet . One of the best ways to secure individuality in dress is to study successful styles and analyze the reasons why they are satisfying . Keeping samples and a list of interesting color and texture combinations such as the following will enable you to use more advantageously the patterns and materials you find for sale and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian silver buttons .

' The gradations of texture to a certain extent indicate their suitability for various times , occasions , ages and personalities . For example , for hard usage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough textures ; for general school or housework use smoother , firmer fabrics like percale or gingham ; for street and church select the finer , more interesting textures such as crepe or moire ; and for special occasions , such as parties or weddings , use the finest textures such as fine lace , net , chiffon , taffeta , fine satin . Of course such a classification is only general , but should help to give a " feeling " of what is suitable . Satin looks casual made shirtwaist style but the texture says gala ? " after-five . " The weave in brocade makes a rich texture whether silk and gold or acetate and cotton and even though made up in a jacket-dress , softly tailored , it still is dressy . Either the satin or brocade jacket-dress is more handsome , yet casual , for dress-up occasions and far more flattering and in better taste for almost any young woman or for far more occasions than an orchid taffeta party dress .

SELECTING PRINTS A printed dress in the wardrobe is a good stand-by ? a practical , dependable sort of garment , because it does not show small spots , wrinkles or tiny breaks as readily as does a solid color ) / These characteristics make it a good general-purpose dress ? a travel dress to wear or pack , a work dress ? , However , it is difficult to be smart in a print . Do n't have your picture taken in a print ( floral , stripe , or plaid ) , especially as one of a group . It should be worn usually only in the spring or summer ? and one new one each spring should be sufficient . There is no doubt that the gay fresh spring prints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wardrobe in the betweenseason period of late winter . Solids , of course , are more becoming to the large figure . Solids should be chosen when the garment design shows fine details of cut and workmanship . Figured designs in material are not confined to the so-called " prints . " Stripes , plaids and checks may be woven in or printed on the fabric , Solid colors woven in figures such as Chinese damasks and herringbone stripes offer an interest in design that comes between a texture and a print and are easy to use . Stripes are almost as satisfactory in prints as in woven , yarn-dyed fabrics , but printed plaids and checks usually offer great difficulties in cutting and fitting because the crosswise lines of the design are often " offgrain " ? that is , not printed to coincide with the filling yarns ( Fig. 54 , p. 225 . Stripes and checks confuse the eyes in sewing and are unpleasant to wear if they have both strong contrasts of light and dark and equal space divisions . /Plaids equally balanced from right to left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than those with unequal balance . Simpler plaids with carefully planned color and - not too striking contrasts are more wearable ? but difficult to find . Plaids suggest sport or tailored clothes , rather more suitable to the youthful than the older woman .  | Figure Bold stripes , even used vertically , widen the figure . If used horizontally they generally , but not always , shorten the figure. /Used diagonally or on the alternating bias , stripes , if not too bold , may create some optical illusions helpful to the large figure . Shadow stripes , broken stripes and stripes with little or no value ( light and dark contrasts are safer choices for the larger figure . Stripes cut in bands on the bias make effective self-trimming ; otherwise select a matching solid decoration . /For example , do not trim a striped dress with a checked collar ; a print dress necessitates a solid color coat . It is a real faux pas to wear a flowered print blouse with a striped or plaid skirt , or to trim a flowered or plaid dress with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmony . the lines in the design of the fabric should have some relation to the lines in the design of the pattern , / Stripes and plaids work up better on straight-line cuts where yokes , collars , and pockets are cut on the straight , not in curves . Round collars , puffed sleeves , round yokes , very circular skirts , princess cuts in a plaid or check , create confusing designs . With tables in stores full of prints ranging from the bizarre ,  | sprawling , dramatic types through the host of florals to the precise little all-overs and dainty pin dots , how can one be sure of a choice that brings distinction or charm in dress ? It is difficult , but they may be analyzed by using basic art principles . 1 . To judge a print , examine it from some distance and in a large piece rather than from a small sample to see the true effect , especially the rhythm . Colors often neutralize each other or blend together , producing an entirely different hue . A red- and blue-checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which did not harmonize with the pure red belt chosen for it because the owner tried to match the small red checks . A tiny red-and-white print may appear pink ? perhaps too dainty for the purpose . 2 . Consider both the pattern and the color in relation to the age of the wearer . Dainty florals or conventionalized kindergarten patterns may be good choices for a preschool child but not appropriate for a college girl or older person . Geometric and abstract prints are excellent for the active general wear of college and business girls , but a little too active and businesslike for older women who will look better in graceful floral ( but conventionalized ) designs and the more sophisticated types of prints . The small , all-over , conventionalized print is likely to appear drab and middle-aged on an older girl but just a neutral enough background for a peppy young college girl . 3 . The personality of the wearer should influence choice , too . The athletic type , the sophisticated type and the extrovert do not look well in dainty geometric or floral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designs . The quiet type requires a medium-sized design in related colors . The average active girl would choose a medium-sized print , but could use more contrast in color and value such as jade green and white stripes widely spaced . The nervous , overactive type of person should avoid active prints ? stripes , checks , fluttery , choppy designs . Too bold stripes would accent a long masculine stride . Polka dots , checks , and plaids make a confused design with freckles , bulging eyes or ringlets in the hair . 4 . The size of the wearer proves more troublesome than other characteristics . Small designs are suitable for both the small and the large person , but with this difference ? that the small person can wear a small floral which would only make a large person appear babyish . The larger girl is likely to look commonplace or old if she selects pin dots or too small a pattern . A good choice for her would be a medium geometric or abstract design that gives a texture effect of body or weight . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no great contrast of light and dark . Large , sprawling , or isolated spots of design are not right for either little girls or big girls . Even if the colors are right and if the motifs in themselves are distinctive , " spaced " prints are best reserved for the dramatic type and the average or tall figure , sizes 14 , 16 , 18 . They are  | easiest to use on a dark or neutral background . In cutting the dress , be careful to have the motifs placed to the best advantage . 5 . Since there are thousands of prints , we would like the design in the one fabric we are now choosing to have distinction . This does not mean that it should be striking or showy , but that it should suit us in all the particulars just outlined , and also be distinctive in itself . WHAT IS A DISTINCTIVE PRINT ? When loud , sprawling florals have been fashionable , an abstract , simple geometric design attracts us , or vice versa . But to be new or different , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristics of prints with distinction follow . Good taste in design must spring from familiarity with the laws of art ? these ideas will help you to analyze your sensations when you look at prints ( Plates XIX , XX , and XXI ) . 1 . Good designs are planned or organized units arranged in an interesting , not monotonous , order . 2 . The units are discernible , not crowded , blurred , smeared , not too sketchy or scratchy in drawing nor carelessly scattered . 3 . The individual units of a design may be quite simple , such as dots , squares , triangles or abstract shapes , but to be distinctive theyghould be arranged in some unusual , imaginative , but orderly form or consist of some unusual color combination . Even seminaturalistic floral patterns may be distinctive if arranged in an orderly way to form a pattern : naturalistic pink roses would be poor in design sprinkled hit-or-miss , but the same shapely roses arranged in well-proportioned stripes might be quaint . They might be highly stylized if changed in hue and arranged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and darks are so spaced that the darks lead the eye into light and light into dark without sudden changes or jerky eye movements . A useful trick is to squint as you study a design : if many masses stand out here and there or vie for importance , rhythm is lacking . If you were making the design you could remove some of the spots , or add connecting lines or rearrange them until the eye travels smoothly from one part of the design to the other . 5 . One clear but unusual color , with a neutral such as white ( gray or black ) , is generally most satisfactory , clean-looking , orderly and easily combined with other fabrics . 6 . A mixture of colors tends to be confusing . If more than two colors are used , one color should predominate and another be secondary , but all should be harmonious . Many ugly percales have such combinations as orchid and henna ; orchid , turquoise and orange ; old rose and orange . Dainty baby colors do not combine well with intense colors. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a  | heart-shaped leaf which a child could scribble off . Rather find the flower and leaf drawn carefully by an artist with imagination , yet with simplicity . Peasant designs ? precise , quaint figures with an unexpected little turn ? lift many small all-over prints out of the commonplace . 8 . Avoid pictorial ideas treated in a photographic manner ? naturalistic scenes , flowers , animals . Rather choose such ideas treated in a highly abstract , conventionalized or stylized manner . Avoid designs shaded to give perspective ; the general effect should be one of flatness . 9 . Multiplicity of design ideas in one fabric and combination of unrelated motifs make for confusion ? for example , flowers superimposed on a plaid background . 10 . In selecting a plain color to combine with a print , select the predominating color . If you want to pick up one of the minor colors in the design to use as an accent , it is ordinarily better to use it in lines such as binding , piping , or a belt rather than in spots or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be used for a collar , but orange would be better in a belt or the edge of a ruffle . WARDROBE COORDINATION The object in planning a wardrobe is to provide for each type of occasion a complete costume , becoming to you , appropriate and with all the parts harmonious-This does not mean necessarily a different costume for each type of occasion . When an outfit fills these requirements you might call it an ensemble ( ahn-sihm'bl ) . How long ahead and how much in detail should a plan be made ? A good method is to make a general plan for such major expenditures as a fur coat or a basic suit over a three-year period and a detailed plan for only one season at a time . One way to learn is to benefit by your mistakes and failures , but that is a slow and . expensive method of educating yourself . Why not profit by the mistakes and successes of other people and the criticisms of your instructors , and learn to apply the following principles ? PRINCIPLES OF WARDROBE BUILDING COLOR SCHEME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . It must be becoming , practical and available on the market . Select solid colors for the backbone of your wardrob7-a basic coat , basic suit and basic dress . Select mostly related hues instead of contrasts get variety through value and texture contrasts . KEY YOUR PLAN TO CASUAL TYPES . The busy everyday life of the typical young American woman ? teacher , housewife , business  | woman or college girl ? requires clothes that can be adapted for around-the-clock occasions . A few years ago they were designated as spectator sports to differentiate from active sportswear ; today they are often termed town-and-country styles . Casual styles ( as opposed to specific ideas for specific events ) come between active play clothes or functional house dresses and the dressy types for more glamorous or formal occasions . The word implies that the garments are suitable to any chance occasion , hence the practicality and popularity of mix-match separates , double-duty jacketed dresses and varied accessories . American ( and college ) life is more informal in this mid-twentieth century , hence good casual clothes are of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , informal and simple enough to serve as background for accessories . Such simplicity of cut requires above average workmanship and fabric so that one must pay more or make her own ? have fewer clothes but of the basic kind . Casual does not mean careless but it does imply the idea of being not too set or conventional ? rather a little more " free and easy " and adaptable . I ; EXPENSIVE GARMENTS COME FIRST . Buy , or at least plan , the most expensive things first ; then plan the rest of your wardrobe around them . Plan your coat before your dresses ( Fig. 11 , p. 70 ) ; your dresses and suits before hat and shoes ; hat before the shoes . The type and design of both coat and shoes must be carefully planned . , Af you have only one coat it must be not too dressy nor too much on the sports order . But even if you have a dress coat and a sport coat , it is better to have them related in color so that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , a green dress coat and a tan or brown sport coat make a better combination than would a black dress coat and a brown sport coat for a college girl addicted to brown shoes , tweeds and sweaters . After your plan is made , you may wait for the December reduction on coats and still be reasonably safe in getting your dresses earlier in the fall . It is a good plan to buy purse and shoes the same season if you want browns or tans , as the next season usually finds a new shade in vogue which makes your older article appear either shabby or unharmonious . It is always a good idea to rotate major expenses . SELECT GOOD ACCESSORIES . Accessories such as shoes , hat , purse , gloves , and jewelry need not be many but should be the best quality you can find for your money . /Adrian says , " The greatest  | fashion weakness of the American woman is to over-accessorize . " " Good accessories should be individual and interesting , even gay , but of such style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several costumes . They should not be tawdry , flimsy or cheap looking . Smartly dressed women , career girls , and professional women , . find it advisable to spend more for hats , shoes , and purse than for a dresso A college girl is probably wiser to spend more for shoes than for a dress . She does n't need to spend as much on a hat ( Fig. 34 , p. 183 ) . She has fewer occasions for gloves and purse ? they need n't be expensive but should be classic and simple and not cheap looking ( Fig. 27 ) . Generally , however , most college girls do n't pay enough or give enough attention to their hats . They need to be more particular in securing better quality , better lines in the shape , and less trimming . They need to be concerned with wearing them with style ( see pages 56 and 183 ) . A $1.98 hat screams cheapness even though worn with $22.50 slippers . Coarse , fraying lace and embroidery , brassy " junk " jewelry ; lowgrade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only give an artificial , cheap , insincere appearance but soon wear out and thus are expensive in the long run . A cheap fur coat or a coat with a cheap fur collar is not as good an investment as a good cloth coat . College girls , unlike career girls , can seldom afford ten-dollar lapel pins and four-dollar gloves . But too often they buy several pieces when for the same money they might purchase one really good article . Honest silver and semiprecious stones are far more appropriate and better taste than fake jewels . For daytime , opaque stones such as turquoise , carnelian , or jade are not only more appropriate but far less costly than brilliant gems , and they are quite suitable for evening wear as well . /KEY ACCESSORIES TO THE BASICS . With one set of major accessories ? hat , shoes , bag and gloves ? in the basic wardrobe color one can branch out in an indefinite number of combinations , usually wearing three of the four or at least two. - True , if coat , dress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At least , one contrast is desirable , maybe two , but surely not three . The contrast may be in value such as beige gloves ; or in hue such as a turquoise scarf ; or in intensity such as a tangerine scarf or feather in the hat ; but not orange hat , orange gloves , orange blouse , and orange shoes ? a tiresome repeat and expensive . If you are tall it is better to select the contrast in hat or scarf .  | if you have large hips , avoid contrast in bag and gloves . If you are short by all means keep the hat and shoes in value or hue like your coat or dress . If you have wide shoulders match your hat to your gloves , or shoes to your bag . The style of your hat sets the tone consistent with the occasion and should be chosen before the shoes as a rule : For early day some brim , with smart ribbon trim is proper ; for afternoon restraint but more decoration and beauty ; for evening the tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a hat are suitable for church or late morning or luncheon parties , they are not best for business or school . At least two hats are needed to use the basic suit for roundthe-clock occasions . Choose hat and shoes before the bag . The handbag for business , street , and travel should be fairly large ? ( it may be an over-the-shoulder style which , by the way , is out of harmony for church , afternoon , or dinner occasions ) . For school a wallet is about all-that is needed . The later the hour the smaller the bag ? thus , small over-the-arm bags ( as a box style ) for afternoon , smaller clutch bags " after-five " are appropriate . Gloves cost less than'the other major accessories but are necessary to complete an ensemble ( Fig. 26 ) . If contrast from the basic color Figure is desired beige is a good all around choice . In general , select beige to complement the warm basic color or the warm hat accent ; and light gray gloves for cool basics and cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beige is always good ) . White gloves may be too emphatic , make hands look larger , and will give a spotty effect if too many other white accents are used on a dark outfit  | ( but not so with light costumes ) . Do not try to match a colored hat such as pink or violet . Decoration on the gloves should be restrained and not compete with other accessories ? especially with bracelets . Consider whether your major accessories especially hat and gloves will look right with your dresses when worn without the coat . If the hat matches one of the other major accessories in color it will look well with the dress with or without the coat . Besides major accessories plan just as carefully minor accessories such as belts , scarves , ties , hose , petticoats ? glasses , handkerchiefs , jewelry , flowers and perfume . If you ca n't afford a fur piece , get a new scarf . A flowered chiffon scarf is not suitable for morning wear ? save it for dressy occasions and then seek one without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you are completely 7 dressed , see if there are not too many centers of interest ? what could be removed to give a general air of restraint , simplicity , beauty ? 9 DEPEND ON CLASSICS . Have fewer , but better , more wearable , garments . Select with greater care so that each garment is suitable to you , wearable practically all the year around , except for the coldest or warmest days , and appropriate for many different occasions. - The secret is to choose classics in coats , suits and major accessories ( Plate XVIII ) . A classic is conservative , not dated in style , and is basically fine in design , fabric and workmanship . A good choice of shoe would be simple pumps with medium heels as a compromise between dressy pumps and sport oxfords ( Fig. 27 , B ) . The simple , casual styles of the spectator-sport type are usually suitable for more than one activity . Classic styles will last through four years of college and even carry over into business life . They may be your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two with your best accessories and yet suitable for school or business later . Other examples are a felt instead of a straw hat , a small hat in place of a large sailor , an evening skirt of black crepe in place of velvet . Three-quarter sleeves may be worn more times and places than cap sleeves/Prints are " good " only in spring and summer . Then , when you select supplements and accessories , which are less expensive , you may choose the seasonal , the gay or the less durable items to appease your trading for variety , " Dress up " your  | Figure classic suit with a frilly blouse or " dress it down " with tailored touches . Learn to recognize the status of a fashion . A style should be in good fashion for you at least three years . If you buy a style at full price when it is coming in , it will bring you more satisfaction and value than if you pay half price for it when it is going out . You wo n't wear it when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away or it will remain pushed back in your closet unused . When puffed sleeves , or long torso styles have ceased to be in fashion ,  | do n't buy or make any more dresses in that style . Discriminate between a fad and a classic . Adapt the fashion in a practical way to yourself and your needs . PLAN SEPARATES TO INTERCHANGE . Select garments in colors and style that are interchangeable . One group of colors that always blend are- brown , green , beige , gold , yellow , rust ; or navy blue , French blue , gray , jade , violet , even a cool red are most versatile Buy some and make some . Jackets , weskits , blouses , sweaters , skirts and slacks can be traded about . Every fashion magazine and every college shop features these " go-togethers , " separates and convertibles ( Fig. 14 ) . However , in striving for such effects , be sure that the results are not theatrical , impractical mixtures or just an added expense . Beware of high-powered salesmanship that persuades you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real suit in your wardrobe . One girl started out with a black and white shepherds ' plaid wool suit and tailored white blouse . In the fall , she added a black drawstring blouse with long full sleeves and a separate black crepe skirt for dress . On some occasions she wore the skirt with the white blouse and checked jacket . Early in the spring , she added a short emerald green box jacket which could be worn with either skirt and either blouse . She had a black felt Breton sailor for year-round wear and a panama cloche with black grosgrain band for spring . As a result that spring she had twelve possible costumes , not counting the hat or other accessory accents . ' PROVIDE FOR CHANGES . Have enough clothes to provide a change ? clothes wear longer if they have a resting period . The most expensive garment will soon look shabby if it is n't kept pressed and clean and allowed to res ' In resting , the wrinkles come out and it regains its life ? resiliency and elasticity . Girdles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rest . For warmer climates you will need a fair supply of washable garments in order to keep fresh-looking. , Going about on summer days in dark crepes and a few so-called better dresses that call for dry cleaning is neither an economy nor good taste . On a limited budget you will have to have several inexpensive wash dresses ? but let them be as durable , neat , and launderable as possible . Even though not high style , they can be becoming , fit well and be in style . " Freshness is an essential . How many changes of underwear j and hose to provide depends on laundering conditions , but the  | modern girl who washes out her undies daily does n't need a " dozen of everything . " Try threes ' Balance among the various groups of your wardrobe is practical and good taste . No one admires the girl who spends too much on evening dresses , yet has soiled underwear and goes around in sloppy everyday clothes and run-down shoes . AVOID " REPEATS . " Do n't invest in costume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your good dress last year was a red , even though everyone raves over how becoming it is on you , your wardrobe will seem to have more variety both to you and to your friends , if this year your big purchase is of some other color . Change to a black or blue or emerald ? whatever fits best with your other clothes . If you already have a useful tweed suit , perhaps a gabardine or a black - faille would be a good choice for the new suit . A printed crepe dress this spring is a very practical addition to a wardrobe , but two prints will not make you twice as happy . If you have a beige and blue plaid skirt , do n't buy another plaid in these colors . Plan for variety in your blouse wardrobe . If you already have several white blouses , choose your new blouse in a color ; if it must be white , have it a softer type . STRESS QUALITY . Buy as good quality as you can afford ? especially stress quality before quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cheaper in the long run than two loosely constructed , fancy types at $4.00 each . A dress at $39.00 will wear three times as long as one at $15.00 ? provided you have shopped for details and quality of fabric ? and you will get more than three times the satisfaction . We do n't mean that the most expensive articles are the best , do we ? A blouse you have made yourself for $2.00 may outwear a ready-made that cost $8.00 . On the other hand , your homemade blouse may not make you very happy . It may lack style because you do n't sew very neatly , because the sleeves are puckered in the armhole , or because it is poorly fitted or because you have laundered it carelessly ; the ready-made one must always be drycleaned , but it stays fresh-looking-longer and you always feel right in it . Carefully weigh all these considerations in connection with quality . To save money so that you can afford to buy quality , try to find designs for home sewing that require minimum yardage . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent that you come out with a skimpy style . But simplicity of design will always  | make for good taste , and the saving in yardage will balance increased cost in material . MAKE CLOTHES LAST . Buy things that will keep that new look for a long time ? that wo n't fade , shrink or wrinkle easily . Take excellent care of your prized possessions . Do n't wear your good clothes on a picnic , to a lab , or when you flop down for a nap . Have play clothes , leisure-time clothes and even protective aprons to save your better garments ? they cost less . Break that habit of misplacing gloves . CHECK ON YOUR INVESTMENT . Learn to invest your money in terms of returns to be received . Poor investments would be a single pair of hose unmatched in color with other pairs , high-priced dance slippers , shoes too short for you , a shoddy wool skirt that will wrinkle or sit out in a few weeks , a dress that will fade , shrink , or stretch after a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of capeskin gloves , a girdle , a raincoat . Estimate the cost per wearing . If you wear a $60.00 suit four times a week for eight months each of three years , or a total of 384 times , it is costing you about 15 cents a wearing . If you wear a $20 evening dress ten times , it is costing you $2.00 an evening . It is wiser for a college girl to pay more for a suit than an evening gown . But a concert singer might be justified in paying more for an evening dress . The average college girl does n't pay $60 for a suit , but perhaps it would be better economy than a $30 suit . Pay more for garments receiving hard wear and less for articles worn on fewer occasions . It is false economy to buy in haste any garment for some particular occasion such as a special party tonight and then be sorry tomorrow . Do n't buy the first thing you fall in love with ; shop around . Then do n't buy unless you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-felt desire . Otherwise , you may end up with a " white elephant . " TRY THINGS TOGETHER . Before buying , try garments and accessories together ? in the store if possible . Wear the dress when you are trying on hats to wear with it . Do n't think you can remember the right shade of blue . Be prepared to pay more for the " return " privilege if you have to take articles home for trying on . But be sure the color and the lines are right for all the articles to be worn together ( Figs. 28 , and 34 , p. 183 ) . Each part may be satisfactory in itself , but it is the total effect that counts .  | Figure MAKE THE PLAN WORK . Have a plan for your entire wardrobe based on these principles . A written plan enables you to see the whole problem and secure harmony . Plan your clothes by the season based on what you had left over from last year and on what you will be doing . Write clown the kind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will need , then those you 'd like to have . Have at least one complete outfit for each of the major occasions or activities of your real life . Check to see that your plan provides tailored durable foundation garments and underwear and other necessities . Check your plan to see that it follows the recommendations resulting from your self-analysis . Estimate the cost of your plans . Work and rework your plan ? until you know fairly well how much you can afford to pay for a coat , hat , or dress . Keeping accounts ( Chap . 27 ) forms a basis for such an estimate . Then shop to find the garment in question for the amount of money you have allowed ( see Chapters 4 and 5 ) . It is n't easy , though . Do n't linger long looking at garments entirely out of your reach , but still do n't shun them . After looking at a better garment , you may decide to buy it and do without something else ( but weigh this carefully ) . To observe better merchandise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priced garment . If you still can not find what you planned , perhaps you can wait . Perhaps you can earn some more money to buy it . Perhaps you can make it yourself . Look over your wardrobe again . What can be made over ? Then revise your plans . But you always get more satisfaction if you have a well-considered money plan and if you shop around until you can find about what you had in mind at the price your plan allows . SATISFACTIONS WARDROBE FAILURES If you have made a mistake in some wardrobe item , analyze the problem . Why is it wrong ? Is it the color or the style ? Is it actively unbecoming and unsuitable or is it merely negative ? First try to improve it by a different choice of accessories . Next try to change your posture to suit it . Almost any garment can be made satisfactory through restyling or refitting ( Chap . 23 ) . If the color is wrong , change the blouse , collar , or accessories or change . your make-up . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basque on a round-shouldered girl is a positive error and should not be repeated . But if a black dress is unsuccessful , be sure to know whether it was the cut , the fabric , the trim , or the accessories or the fact that black was not your basic color . Perhaps it was too matronly or too skimpy in cut . WARDROBE SUCCESSES After good planning there will be a never-ending satisfaction in wearing your clothes with the confidence that they are really right . When you feel the urge for a change or a " lift , " assemble new combinations from your investments . It should not be necessary to go on a shopping spree . Having well-chosen basic outfits , you are always ready to accept invitations . You can go anywhere and have a good time . After getting dressed , keep clothing in the background of your thoughts ? you can forget how you look . You will be charming and attractive because you feel self-confident ? you feel no inadequacy because every part is just right .

SUMMARY There are many angles to the problem of being well dressed or having good-looking clothes . After this year of study of these various aspects , after making some clothes so that you know values , and after an inventory of your assets , you may want to revamp your wardrobe completely . It would be most impractical for the average girl to throw everything away and begin all over . For most of us the sensible thing to do is to plan as carefully as possible , shop around and ask ourselves these questions before investing time or money in a new outfit or any part of one . 1 . Will it fit a need or do I have one suitable for the same occasions ? 2 . Will it " do something for me " or will it just " do " ? 3 . Can I afford it , is it worth it ? Is it cheap-looking or does it seem to accent quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now have ? by actual test ? 5 . Will it give double-duty ? for several kinds of occasions and other seasons ? 6 . What other purchases must I make to complete it ? 7 . How long will it last as far as fashion is concerned ? As far as durability goes ? Will the upkeep be expensive or laborious ? 8 . Will the people whose opinions I respect approve my choice ? 9 . Is it a " spur of the moment " bargain or is it going to be a " perfect love " because it is a part of a wardrobe plan ? 10 . Will the completed outfit or ensemble meet the standards for a harmonious whole ? Footnote  | Footnote  | Footnote  | BUYING FABRICS Can I tell by feeling or looking how cloth will wear ? What is the difference between a print and a gingham ? What fabrics would make a good summer travel suit and blouses for the Southwest ? What kind of linen is " Butcher 's linen " ? What are " spans " ? Must all crepes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiten grayed white rayon slips ? What are reliable " over-the-counter " tests ? What qualities in a net designed for window curtains might be absent in a net for an evening dress which still is satisfactory ? What effect will 5% shrinkage have on a dress ? Why is a flannel shirt recommended in desert climates ? Whether we buy our clothes ready-made or make some , it is imperative that we be able to judge quality and values in fabrics . By values we refer to the usefulness or service a fabric can give . A fine quality or grade of gingham would have a different use than a coarse grade of gingham : one is valued for its dainty , sheer coolness ; the other is preferred for its sturdy , protective qualities . Because of the labor and machinery , and perhaps the raw material , the first sells for three times as much , but the coarse one may wear six times as long in a pair of child 's overalls . It is n't all a matter of price . The finer grades usually sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasantly exhilarating if not positively exciting to say , " I 'm going to buy a dress , " ? meaning either a delightful shop-141  | , ping trip for a ready-made garment or simply selecting some material and a pattern . Making a dress is a simple process if you visualize what it is to be and can see the whole problem as composed of a few major steps : 1 . Selecting fabric and pattern together . 2 . Preparing fabric and pattern . 3 . Cutting and marking construction aids. 4 . Sewing and fitting in three major steps . If you take your wardrobe-building at all seriously , your mental attack begins correctly with a need . Do you need a dress to go with your coat , to give you a " lift , " or to relieve a garment about to wear out ; a school dress , a date dress , or a long evening dress ? If this is your first dress to make , it is probably wise to make a simple school dress . Your teacher and the class may decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before starting a dress . Only in small classes is it practical for each girl to select an entirely different problem where the teacher will need to give a great deal of individual supervision . Consider what skills you already possess and what new skills you need to learn . The type of garment settled , you will want to consider the color and texture of material before choosing a pattern ( the cut or design ) . The color and texture are important in keeping your wardrobe balanced or coordinated , so that clothes and accessories already on hand may be worn with the new dress or so that the new dress will fit in with proposed later purchases . Also , the pattern must be considered along with the fabric . You must study a few typical patterns first to find out the average yardage for the kind of garment you are planning . Which should be purchased first ? the pattern or the fabric ? There is no rule about this point for they must be considered together . After the decision is made in regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern , alter it , and then buy the exact yardage required . WHAT TO LOOK FOR Problems affecting our choice of materials for a garment are : 1 . Will it fade or hold its color ; will it retain its texture or become shiny , wrinkle , or crease easily ?  | 2 . Will it snag , rough up , become fuzzy ; will it keep its shape or stretch , sag , shrink or slip at the seams ? 3 . Will it he cool or warm , irritate the skin , resist perspiration , absorb or have any odor ? 4 . Is it mothproofed , waterproof , or water repellent ? 5 . Do I need all these qualities in this garment ? 6 . How will it clean ? Can I take a chance on washing it ? How can I tell ? 7 . What is its life expectancy ? How soon will it be dated or out-moded ? 8 . What are its possibilities for making over , handing down , or sharing with other members of the family ? 9 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type be as satisfactory ? 10 . Is it the right texture for the pattern I want ? In general , a dress is as valuable as its weakest link . One of these details overlooked may make all the other qualities of little value . For example , it is poor economy to pay a high price or put a lot of work on fabric excellent in ten of these respects , yet have it pull apart at the seams or fade after hanging in the closest for just a few weeks . SHOPPING FOR YOUR FABRIC In shopping for fabric , do n't be rushed into a decision by a clerk or be distracted by the confusion of so much merchandise , but be open to suggestions and look around . Feel a lot of fabrics and observe them at a distance . Secure samples if possible and take them home to study . Compare with your wardrobe and accessories . Feel the fabric for softness , crispness , and other texture qualities . Linen should feel leathery and cool ? wool springy , elastic , almost soapy soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any fabric and release it to note crush or wrinkle resistance . Fold the fabric crosswise and lengthwise to note its ability to take pleats . Drape the fabric in folds ? bias and straight . Stand before a mirror to see this effect ? or have the clerk demonstrate . Try sheer materials over your skin and over proposed slip materials for sheen and color effects . Judge the fabric at a distance , especially a print ( p. 122 ) . FABRICS FOR BEGINNERS Materials that are easy for beginners are firm , closely woven , nonfraying and somewhat thin , so that they are easily pressed flat or  | creased with the finger while pinning , basting or stitching . Avoid materials that are wiry , sleazy , stretchy , or creepy . Fabric that ravels easily requires wider seams and overcasting . It is hard to learn to use the needle and thimble on bulky , thick , stiff materials or to stitch accurately on materials with a nap like corduroy or velveteen ; or on ribbed materials like heavy piques ; on eyelet embroidery ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flock dots , or paint applied in stenciling . Materials that require more time in pressing include woolens and worsteds , some of the acetates ; fabrics that are very hard , firm , or heavy , like pique ; fabrics with a nap or pile ; dark-colored heavy cottons like drill . Woolens and loosely woven fabrics like tweed and crash are more pliable when easing in fullness in the sleeve cap than are firm fabrics like broadcloth and polished cotton ; it is easier to shrink out the excess fullness ( luring pressing . Beginners save time if they choose material which is preshrunk and which is not badly stretched off grain on the bolt ( some " disciplined " or " regulated " fabrics , like chintz ) . Pique is difficult to straighten . Small , all-over prints or solid colors are easier to execute than larger motifs , plaids or stripes with a right and left pattern or upand-down patterns . Solid colors show up more defects in stitching but save time in placing the pattern , especially if there is no right or wrong side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the fabric , as such lines are almost always printed off grain . A plaid gingham ( yarn-dyed ) is easier to cut and make than a plaid percale ( printed ) . FABRIC TO SUIT THE PATTERN No matter how lovely a piece of material appears or how durable tests show it to be , the character or " hand " of the fabric must be right for the cut and construction of the pattern . Sheers need fullness to avoid a skimpy look ; crisp , stiff sheers , such as organdy , are better for bouffant styles while the firmer heavier sheer crepes are better for draped or pleated designs . Where designs such as polka dots occur on a sheer , avoid using the fabric in layers as in a double collar and a peplum , or a confusing effect will result ; solid sheers , on the other hand , often give lovely tone effects when made up in layers as in tucks and hems .  | Pleats demand firm close weaves with warp heavier than filling , such as percale , gingham , lightweight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuzzy woolens ; unpressed pleats drape better in soft fabrics with body and weight such as flannel , crepe , jersey . If crease-resistant the skirt is easier to keep pressed . Tailored designs require firm , crisp , fairly smooth close weaves . Classics for such effects are ginghams , linens , good grades of seersucker , soft denims , gabardines , twills , linen type rayons . Shantung is not too textured , but boucle and ratine would be difficult to tailor . Too smooth and too hard crepes and twills , while stitching nicely , are troublesome to press without a shine and also show up irregularities of stitching . Patterns with fine details such as pin tucks , shirring , or smocking require sheer , soft , and fine weaves such as voile , dimity , chambray , crepes , batiste , and linen , in solid colors . Intricate cuts show to the best advantage in solid colors and smooth textures . They do not work up as well in rough , napped or pile fabrics , or in prints , but demand flat crepes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Straight-line designs are effective in plaids , checks , and stripes , while curved details such as yokes and collars look better in solids or all-over patterns , or polka dots . Curves cut across stripes result in many awkward angles ( Fig. 25 , p. 121 ) . Surplice blouses , square yokes , epaulet shoulders , and straight or pleated skirts are adapted to bordered fabrics . Draped designs require soft , pliable materials that fall into graceful folds without readily losing their shape . Test by holding up on the bias . The material can not be starchy , slimsy , or light and airy . Heavy crepe , satin , and velvet come to mind . Skirts gathered all the way around or just in front demand soft , pliable fabrics . The twill blends , and crosswise ribs like poplin , are not very suitable unless cut crosswise . Gather up one end of a piece of cloth to be sure of its shirring or draping qualities . Evening styles vary greatly in silhouette . For the bouffant consider taffeta , moire , faille , organdy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chintz , or gingham made up very full . For the stately and less bouffant style rich , stiff , lustrous fabrics seem more appropriate , for instance , satin , brocade , peau de soie , velvet and linen . For sleek , clinging styles jersey , crepe , lame , matelasse , and velvet are good if firm , good weight , resilient , and crush-resistant . Pile fabrics like corduroy and velveteen should be made up in styles  | with as few construction lines as possible and little or no outside stitching . Circular cuts should be worked up in permanently stiff , no-sag fabrics like faille , polished cotton , sharkskin , but not loose weaves , crepes , or low grade felts . Set-in sleeves require fabrics capable of " easing-in " under the needle and " shrinking out " by steaming , such as gingham , linen , woolens ; avoid close , tight weaves as poplin , faille , taffeta , gabardine , broadcloth , chintz , polished cotton ? most fabrics of manmade fibers and crease-resistant finishes . Most novelty materials , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to unusual texture should be made up in simple designs . They usually cost more than standard fabrics , can be worn on fewer occasions , are difficult to care for , and frequently are not so durable . In general , study the suggestions made on the commercial pattern for the right kind of fabric . In making substitutions , keep to the general type outlined there . LOOK FOR LABELS Fabrics of cotton , wool , linen , silk , rayon , acetate , and other natural and man-made fibers have different characteristics which affect their appearance as well as their suitability for different purposes . In order to press or launder fabrics with success , we must know of what fibers they are made and the kind of finish they have . The old burning tests are practically obsolete . Nowadays some manufacturers label both piece goods and ready-made garments as to fiber content in terms of percentages . The better labels carry information to tell whether the fabric is washable , hand-washable or dry-cleanable ? and facts about the wear and care as well ( Figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if so , the best temperature . Pay particular attention to the type of finish and its relative permanence . Insist on seeing these labels . Use the information in the planning , the making , the wearing , and the care of your garment . Some mail-order companies give excellent information or specifications in their catalogues , which are extremely helpful to the shopper who likes to make comparisons ( Figures 29 and 30 ) . Sometimes stores lose labels from the bolts . But keep on asking for them . Information would be more permanent if printed on the selvage . Be alert  | to new developments , new terms on labels , new definitions . Inquire if they are not printed on the label . BUYING COTTONS Two terms found on labels , selvages , or bolt boards which indicate satisfactory quality in cottons are combed and two- or threeply ( rather than one-ply or single ) . If these terms are not mentioned , it is altogether probable that the fabric is made of not combed , but carded , yarns indicating short fibers or mixed lengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run . For finer , long wearing cottons select fabrics made of combed yarns of longstaple fibers . Ply refers to the number of single strands twisted together to make one thread or yarn for weaving ? which process gives strength , long life , coolness , clearness , cleanliness , and smoothness of fabric due to absence of fuzz . Both terms are significant applied to broadcloth , marquisette , dimity , gingham , fine muslins , and pique . Sea Island , Pima , Egyptian are terms that refer to fine , longstaple cottons ? meaning a fine grade . In general , yarns should be well-twisted , strong , smooth , and uniform . Some labels give the yarn or thread count , i.e. , the number of warp threads and the number of filling threads per inch . ( Threads and yarns are used interchangeably . Technicians usually prefer yarn for referring to the filaments used in weaving and thread referring to a cord for sewing . ) If you are not a good judge of fineness by sight and touch , just read the labels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find some with a thread count of 200 , implying that it is 100 X 100 or 100 square . These two latter terms mean that there are 100 threads in the warp per inch and 100 in the filling . Other things being equal , we find a balanced construction most durable ? that is , the same number of warp threads as filling threads ; hence , we prefer 80 square to a 70 X 90 construction . A very good grade of percale that we think both fine and durable is sold as 80 square . There are various lower grades ranging from medium down to very poor , such as 68 X 76 , 64 X 64 , 64 X 60 , down to 40 X 45 and 30 X 35 . Their prices should be ranged accordingly . In other words , yarn count is an accurate method of indicating the relative fineness , firmness , or looseness of weave and definitely states what the naked eye may not easily discern . In looking for durability stick to the plain and twill weaves ?  | avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ durable if the floats are short , the threads fine and woven unevenly . Too heavy cords as in some dimities rub against finer threads resulting in slits in wear . Lack of balance in the construction of broadcloth renders it less durable than a balanced percale . Long floats passed over too many threads are easily snagged and torn . Where lasting strength is required , specifications of tensile strength , abrasion-resistance , and slippage-resistance are helpful . Standards for these characteristics in dress materials are not wellestablished , but when you compare label or catalogue specifications , they should certainly be considered . Military uniform materials are judged in such a manner . Colorfastness and shrinkage control are the two most desired characteristics in cotton dresses . It is important in judging colorfastness to have some degree of guarantee . " Colorfast " on a label is better than no statement at all , but we prefer more specific statements such as " fast to sun and washing , " " fast only when dry-cleaned , " " fast to perspiration . " The terms vat-dyed , developed dyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently has it been possible to get blue denims vat dyed so they do n't bleed . No colors are absolutely fast but merely relatively so . Read the Indian Head label . You may wash or boil a sample , or expose a piece to the light for several weeks , or rub a dark sample with a damp piece of white to discover its tendency to fade , bleed , run or crock ( rub off ) ? but a label ( based on tests in a " Launder-Ometer " or " Fade-Ometer " ) with a guarantee is more reliable and saves time . " Washable " does not mean that the fabric will not fade or shrink . Generally speaking , yarn-dyed fabrics ( ginghams , few denims ) hold their color better than piece-dyed fabrics ( prints , percales , most denims ) . As a shopper you will certainly want to know that the material will hold its shape after it is made ? that it will neither shrink nor stretch nor slip at the seams . Shrinkage can be controlled in the factory by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than 1 per cent " ; other satisfactory processes are Riginel , 1 per cent , and Danshrunk , 1 ? 2 per cent . Such terms as preshrunk , super-shrunk , washable , will not shrink out of fit are indefinite and misleading , hence no longer permitted on labels by the Federal Trade Commission . Satisfactory standards are 1 per cent and 2 per cent of residual shrinkage ; 5 per cent and over are  | not very satisfactory for washing unless an allowance is made in advance or unless you preshrink the material yourself . A shrinkage of 3 per cent means a loss of about 1 ? " in the bust measure of a size 18 dress . A shrinkage of 5 per cent means that a size 16 is changed to size 14 in width and is 21/2 " shorter . ( For specific home tests see pp. 227 and 497 . ) There are no very satisfactory methods of controlling stretching , but we should not expect loosely twisted yarns , weak yarns , yarns of short fibers , loosely woven fabrics , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape . Slippage at seams will often occur when snug-fitting styles are in vogue . For such styles , one must be wary of satins , ribbed fabrics , slippery yarns , loosely twisted yarns , heavily napped fabrics , and fabrics with the warp and filling quite unequal in size . A practical over-the-counter slippage test you can apply is to exert pressure on the cloth between your two thumbs and two forefingers ? both crosswise and lengthwise ( Fig. 31 ) . If the threads shift apart readily , as they would in a cheesecloth , slippage troubles will follow.If you were planning slacks , a satin evening dress , a faille suit , a lining for your coat , or an underslip , this characteristic would be worth your consideration . You can expect slippage in highly napped outing flannel , sateen , and silk or rayon ribs . Having seams cut on the bias sewn with two rows of stitching will reduce slippage . Many finishes have been developed to increase the usefulness of fabrics . Mercerizing is one of the oldest and most reliable of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is generally applied to those of higher grade , of combed yarns , in fine weaves . Durene is a trade name guaranteeing such qualities . The uninitiated shopper may mistake sizing and dressing for mercerizing . Such temporary fillings as starch , gum , and mucilage rub or wash out , leaving a sleazy fabric . Labels often tell the percentage of dressing , but , if you can , rub a small corner of the fabric to discover its presence . Thoroughly washing a sample also reveals the real fabric underneath the starch . Do not confuse starches and other sizings with the new type of permanent finish or crispness to be found on rayons and such cot-  | tons as muslin , voile , batiste , and lawn : Saylerized and Bellmanized . The synthetic resins last through many washings and impart a body which one can not secure by starch . Resin finishes , including the newer silicones , have revolutionized the popular uses of cotton in crease-resistance alone ( this does not mean that the fabric will not crease , wrinkle , or crush but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the air ) . Resin finishes also contribute to water- and soil-repellence ; quickness of drying ; reduce fading , ravelling ; add glaze , semipermanence to embossed designs and pleating . Certain weaknesses existed in the early products but research has obviated many of them ; some are still not permanent ( but may be restored by plastic starch or by the dry cleaner ) ; some have strong odors when damp ; some whites turn yellow when rinsed in a bleach . Some need no or little ironing , but most do ? while still damp . Creaseresistant fabrics are not so absorbent as the unfinished cottons hence are not so comfortable for extremely warm weather unless the design of the garment is loose and low cut . The weight of some cottons is significant of quality . Retail buyers and clerks need to be familiar with weights as a basis for orders . Dress denim is not as heavy as denim for overalls . Specifications for such staples as denim , and outing flannel are expressed in terms of 4 , 5 , or 6 oz. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded as heavy if they run near 2 yd. per pound . A lightweight broadcloth has 4 yd. per pound . Lightness of weight is preferred in shirtings if because of fineness of fiber and yarn but not if because of weakness in yarns or loose construction . Most cottons come in 36 " widths . A few staples like cambric , challis , calico , outing flannel , denim , duck , and Swiss are found in 27 " ? 30 " widths ; organdy , 40 " ? 44 " wide ; and net , 72 " wide . Hold organdy to the light . If it is coarse , fuzzy , cloudy , or irregular in construction with a low thread count it is of lower grade . The better qualities will have permanent finish or stiffness . Some of the finer ones are now guaranteed not to roll at the edges , which makes them ideal for collars and ruffles . In dotted Swiss , look for sheerness without coarseness of thread in the background weave . The better grades have each dot , as in embroidery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each dot made of several threads with loose ends which pull out easily . Imitation dotted Swiss is a kind of voile with the dots pasted  | on . Test to see if they wash off easily or turn brown when ironed : they tend to blunt the machine needle and do not take neat-looking top stitching . The fuzzy side of dotted Swiss is usually considered the wrong side ; but negligees are more comfortable if the fuzzy side is out . Voiles are of finer quality if there is absence of fuzz and cloudiness when held to the light . Look for combed yarns , ply construction , fine yarns of firm twist , high thread count to secure sheerness and fineness , crispness rather than limpness . The better grades are crease-resistant . Pique of good grade has high thread count , fine , even yarns and deep wales . Cheaper pique is sleazy or fuzzy and has shallow wales . Narrow or fine wales are of no better quality than wide wales ; width of wale is simply a matter of design . Waffle or birdseye pique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look for shrinkage and colorfastness guarantees . Pique requires extra effort in ironing on the wrong side to bring out the wales . Test the creaseresistant finish to see if it turns yellow in laundering . Cotton broadcloth is so firmly woven that it does not lend itself to easing the standard sleeve into a normal armhole but is excellent for shirt sleeve styles , for lapped and stitched fell seams , pleats , tucks , and other tailored features . Real broadcloth shows a fine crosswise rib ; imitations are just plain print ( percale ) cloth with a sizing . Fine grades are made of combed 2- or 3-ply yarns and mercerized ( a 2 X 2 would be 2-ply yarns both ways ) ; low grades are carded only . The standard thread count is 144 X 76 , finer ones 154 X 84 , lower grades 136 X 60 , or 112 X 60 , and the coarsest of carded singles are as low as 50 X 56 . We must expect such construction to be weaker in the filling , therefore it tends to split more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-staple cotton ; Wamsutta is a manufacturer of fine qualities of both broadcloth and percale . Dan River and Galey and Lord are two reliable trade names . " City " or " Winter " cottons have become fashionable through good designing and tailoring by famous French , Italian , and American dressmakers . They are dark , in standard weaves , well-designed but simple , with desirable finishes often to " handle " like wool or linen fabrics . Fuller , Thomas , Herbert Meyer and Hope Skillman cottons are synonymous with quality and style .  | BUYING LINENS On linens , shop for firm even weaves ? a fuzzy linen indicates short or low grade fibers in the yarns , which will also stretch and break easily . Irregular yarns indicate potential holes if due to low grade fiber or careless construction but a certain amount of irregularity is to be expected for the linen-y texture . It is possible to secure linen guaranteed not to shrink , stretch , fade , or wrinkle . Reliable brand names include : Moy-gash ' - el , Irish Linen . Some cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The so-called " Butcher 's " linen has been a serviceable fabric but it is not linen : it is rayon or acetate with a texture like linen and should be called rayon butcher , linen-textured rayon , or linen type acetate . The FTC rulings require that fiber content , whether of linen or a mixture with other fibers , must be fully stated without deception . BUYING WOOLS If you are making a wool dress , suit , or coat , you will probably prefer 100 per cent , good quality wool because of its warmth , great durability , and the elasticity and resilience which make a garment hold its shape and remain free of wrinkles . Crushed in the palm of your hand a good woolen feels alive , springy , soapy soft , yet when released it shows little or no creasing . Avoid pieces that feel boardy , harsh , lifeless , overly stiff , dull , or matted , even though they cost less . The Wool Labeling Act of 1939 , requires wool products to carry labels giving the amounts of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 5 per cent of the fabric ) , the percentage of foreign matter , and the name of the manufacturer and seller . Wool means virgin or new wool that has not been used before . Reprocessed wool has been woven , then unwoven and rewoven without having been used . Re-used wool has been used and then reworked ; it was formerly called shoddy . Low grade wools and re-used wools are not so warm , and do not hold their shapes so well or look so rich in color as high-grade virgin wools . Reprocessed wools also come in various grades . Good quality reprocessed wool , especially when combined with 50-55  | per cent new wool , gives durable , satisfactory service at a lower price . Generally speaking , virgin wools and 100 per cent wools will give longer , better service , but good reprocessed wools are better than low grade virgin wools . Re-used wools are harsh , linty , dulllooking , crease readily , and do not wear well . Since the fibers are so short , re-used wool is not found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for coats , the woolens ( Fig. 32 ) . Men 's suits are often of worsted . Worsteds are made from long fibers , combed parallel before spinning into smooth , tightly twisted yarns , which make firm , compact , distinctly visible weaves , as in gabardine and crepe . They feel wiry , firm , and hard . They tailor well and hold their press but may develop a shine , so they require careful pressing and wearing . Lowgrade worsteds are loosely woven , harsh , limp , and show some surface fuzz when folded and viewed along the surface . Such worsteds wrinkle and develop a shine very readily , become baggy , and have rather muddy colors ; blends of wool , silk , De ' - cron , or other manmade fibers are better choices . Figure  | Woolens are of loosely twisted yarns of shorter fibers not combed ; hence , the fibers do not lie straight as in worsted yarns , but cross and intermingle , leaving protruding ends . Such yarns are softer or more fuzzy or fluffy and produce such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fleece , and Shetland type woolens or herringbones . Woolens are felted , shrunk , or napped in finishing , sometimes to such an extent that the weave is barely discernible ; if overdone , the foundation may be very weak . Look at the back and pull the fabric firmly in both directions to determine relative strength . If the nap rolls up easily in " pills " or rubs off when you rub it briskly , you may be sure it will soon wear threadbare and look shabby . Good woolens are springy , elastic , soft , warm , and do not wrinkle . Wool is valued for its durability , its insulating qualities , its resilience , its elasticity , its " drape " or " hand , " and the richness of its colors . It hangs back in shape after a rest . Special animal fibers such as camel 's hair , vicuna , alpaca , llama , angora , cashmere , and rabbits ' hair are blended with wool fibers to give other special effects of lightness , softness , luster , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save the scarcer wool ; very often they reduce the springiness and the depth of color we appreciate in a good allwool material . Such combinations deserve our honest evaluation . Half cotton with wool reduces cost and shrinkage in a sport shirt ( Viyella ) . On the other hand , cotton in a coat , skirt , or suit fabric will cause it to wrinkle readily , and it may soon look faded and soiled . All-wool worsteds and woolens are usually 54 " ? 56 " wide ; some are 60 " to permit more economical layouts of patterns . While winterweight suiting weighs 10 ? 12 oz. per yard , spring dress weights are as light as 5 ? 8 oz. per yard . Very fine crepes and gabardines ( Charmeen , Milateen ) run as low as 4 oz. per yard . A simple home test for the presence of cotton or other fibers of vegetable origin is to boil a small sample in a lye solution ( 1 tbsp. to 2 cups of water ) for fifteen minutes . The wool quickly dissolves , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for identifying unlabeled garments , checking on the reliability of labels , and identifying fibers for home-dyeing and stain-removal . Wool cloth usually requires dry-cleaning . It should be steam pressed with a moderately warm iron over a protective press cloth . Some of the cheaper wool crepes of the granite type do not press  | satisfactorily . Pressing during construction requires extra time . But the wool garment of good grade when completed requires less frequent pressing and care . We like to find on better wool fabrics such terms as " London shrunk , " " sponged " or " ready for the needle " to assure us that shrinking and pressing before making are not necessary . Both wools and blends are now available that have been treated for shrinkage ( Lanaset , San f orlan ) . Many are considered machine washable , but hand-washing is better and dry-cleaning still better . Most garments of wool are so tailored that dry-cleaning is imperative . Wools resistant to moth damage are quite common . Silicone finishes are water-repellents used extensively on wools and synthetics . Be prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kinds . Keep it aired , brushed , and rested from too constant wear . Some leaders in wool manufacturing and finishing who provide informative labels are : Forstmann , Botany , Strong-Hewatt , Deering Milliken , Hockanum , Juilliard . In selecting wool cloth for a coat or suit , one can do better tailoring on a woolen than a worsted , on a rough texture than on a smooth if it is not sleazy , or too thick and heavy . Plain gray or tan twill shows spots and shine more readily than a gray or tan tweed or flannel . In buying blends the fabric looks better for a longer time in mixtures like tweeds and herringbones of medium value than in solid dark blue or black or flat colors . Dark blue and black should always be selected from the better grades , which naturally cost more but give lasting satisfaction . In jersey the number of wales ( stripes ) per inch and one-half , termed gauge , is indicative of quality . The higher numbers are finer . Hold jersey to the light and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a straighter regularity in the pressing of the knitted grain . Some of the jersey blends are valued because shrinkage , sagging and stretching are reduced . BUYING SILKS Silk is a luxury fabric chosen for its lustrous softness , its resistance to crushing , its beautiful colors , its long - wearing quality . Extremely fine sheer silks cost more than those not so fine ; but heavier silks cost more proportionately than lightweight ones . The FTC requires that the word silk must be applied only to  | fabrics made of the natural fiber produced by the silk worm ; that unweighted silk may be labeled pure-dye silk , pure silk , or all silk ; and that the true percentages of silk and weighting must be stated . Under 10 per cent weighting adds body to silk at a moderate price ; excessive weighting causes silk to split , especially when the fabric is creased or exposed to heat and perspiration : a coat lining of weighted silk would not be satisfactory . If a piece of pure silk is burned , the odor will be similar to burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black balls that easily crush in the fingers . If weighting has been added to the dye , the burning will be a slow smoldering , leaving ash in the shape of the original sample ? not in balls . Do not confuse this metallic weighting used in dye with the sizing or dressing often put on silks or rayons to increase their hand or drapability . Dressing often shows water spots . You can test material by simply sprinkling on a few drops of water . When dry , rings show up if dressing is there . Will this affect its use for you ? Small amounts of cotton , rayon , acetate , nylon , or weighting may or may not be desirable but reduce the cost and should be known in order to estimate the value and to help you in making , pressing , or cleaning . Some silks may be washed by hand but should be labeled as wash silks . Most silks look better , however , if drycleaned . Spun silks are made from silk noils ( waste silk ) spun like cotton instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in new , cultivated silk . They are less desirable as they tend to be fuzzy , dull , and lifeless , but woven in crash effects , they make very good casual types of dresses . Wild silks such as pongee and shantung have a desirable texture interest and wear well ? both in natural and dyed colors excellent for summer suits . They tend to limpness so that lining throughout with net or stiffening is common today . Raw silk still contains the natural gum of the silk worm and looks like unbleached linen crash . Some fabrics made of reworked or spun silk have been erroneously advertised as raw silks . Chiffons and crepes are judged by their relative degrees of fineness , smoothness , evenness of weave , and weight ( taffeta , barathea , peau de soie ) , as well as for their richness and stability of color and the high artistic quality of the applied design . Some exclusive designers and importing houses may add several dollars per yard to the original price of a fabric when they first launch it on the  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they become available to ordinary shoppers . After a season or two you may be able to find these beautiful fabrics in pure-dye silks as remnants in metropolitan stores . It will take some experience on your part to recognize the real bargains . Generally it is safer to depend on labels , on the regular stock found in the wellestablished stores , or on the guidance of the store buyer and the regular clerks . Imported silks are generally higher priced because of the tariff . BUYING FABRICS OF MAN-MADE FIBERS Fibers developed by the chemist have been so improved and so many more choices are offered today that their purchase and use are rather confusing . Clarify your thinking with this classification of fibers which includes only the major textiles in common use for clothing . Table A fabric with yarns of different fibers is called a combination or mixture ; a fabric made of yarns composed of different fibers mixed before the yarn is spun is called a blend . The blender selects from both natural and man-made fibers to create a new yarn to gain a  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So far there has been insufficient research in actual use situations to enable either producers or consumers to say what percentage of a given fiber blends to the best advantage with other given fibers . Since nylon is stiff it is excellent in velvet pile ; combined with acetate the drape is improved . Cotton is valued for absorption ? with nylon we gain wrinkle-resistance , crispness in a summer dress that is cooler , more comfortable than 100 per cent nylon . Nylon and rayon are popular in blends ? nylon strong , rayon inexpensive . To be an intelligent purchaser one must evaluate the inherent characteristics of each fiber in the cloth . So far the average consumer can not estimate the worth of percentages , hence we must rely more on the label not only to tell what is in the cloth but especially what it will do for us . Millions are spent on research in this area , so that each year we will find out more and more about the best percentages . Differences in spinning , weaving , and finishing the cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reliability of the manufacturer . Is it a nationally advertised firm ? Are instructions there for use or care ? All the man-made fibers are thermoplastic : some melt at lower temperatures than natural fibers . They are moth- and mildew-resistant , do not shrink , are not highly absorbent ; are washable , dry quickly ; require little pressing . Only Vicara and Acrilan are as weak as cotton , others are strong . All are supplied in filaments ( continuous lengths ) making for smoothness and sheen ; or in staples ( with crimp , cut in lengths and spun as other fibers ) for fluffiness , to resist pilling . Many can be given a high-stretch treatment ( Helanca , Flexcel , Agilon ) especially for knit goods . In general , while these modern fabrics resist creasing and have good wrinkle recovery , and are easy to launder ? they are better not dried by wringing or spin-drying but do better if hung to drip dry , then pressed . Otherwise wrinkles are set and the garment lacks that smooth new look of good tailoring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special problem ; unless you save , read , and follow the label or hang-tag you are taking chances in ordinary laundering . Characteristics of each of the man-made fibers that make them useful either in blends or in 100 per cent cloths are briefly reviewed here . Acetates are thermoplastic , therefore melt or glaze if iron is too hot , but heat-setting can make durable surface textures like moire .  | They are soluble in acetone except Arnel . They absorb little , dry quickly , resist wrinkles but once creased ( sharp hems , pressed open seams ) stay marked . Heat treating creates fabrics that will not shrink , stretch out of fit , and will hold pleats through several washings . Formerly they faded from gas fumes , but now the solutiondyed process insures permanent color ( Colorspun , Chromspun , Celapernt ) . Acetates have both brilliant and soft colors , drape beautifully , and are economical . A heavyweight acetate satin or brocade supplies rich glamour at moderate cost . Crimped acetate may resemble worsted . Crystallette of flat acetate fibers is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rayon and cotton to reduce seam slippage and ravelling . Rayon has cool absorbency , creping and crimping qualities that alone or in blends give the appearance of natural fibers ; dyes well , is easily laundered and inexpensive . Rayon finishes include creaseresistance ? Tebelized , Superset ; and shrinkage control ? Sanforset . Avcoset makes viscose rayons machine washable . Jetspun and Coloray are solution-dyed viscose ( good blacks ) . Beni berg , the American cuprammoniurn rayon , is outstanding as a sheer ; also supplies nubby effects like douppione silks . Rayons as a class are generally weaker when wet ; they require special care in laundering . White rayons stay white where white silk turns yellow in use . Most rayons are slightly slippery . They ravel easily , so require wide seams . Test crepes by sprinkling with a few drops of water ; if they shrink or water-spot , they may not be what you want . Some rayon crepes like alpaca shrink badly but may be restored by pulling to shape while damp and while ironing . Others stretch badly , shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various kinds of rayon filaments are used in their original continuous length , they produce smooth , fine , cool , sheer , often lustrous fabrics . When these filaments are cut into varying lengths , they are called rayon staple and when spun into a yarn , as the natural fibers are spun , they are called spun rayons or spuns for short . This process makes a cloth dull , soft , and spongy , more like wool , linen , or cotton . Spun rayons which we have come to know well include challis , flannel , hopsacking , gabardine , shantung , twills , tropical suiting , and " butcher " rayon . In all kinds of rayon materials , finer yarns and yarns with a crepe twist produce a more durable , better draping fabric than do the coarser , loosely twisted yarns . In buying rayons it is very important to read the labels for the  | fiber content , for finish , and for the special instructions for care . Usually dry-cleaning is required , but many of them can be handwashed . Spun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of rayons on the wrong side with a very light touch or protective press cloth so as not to develop a shine . To test a fabric for the presence of rayon , burn the corner of a small sample and observe the flame , odor , and ash . The viscose and cuprammonium burn like cotton , leaving a light negligible ash . Acetate burns with a rapid flare and sharp acrid odor ; it puckers and melts into a large hard black mass which can not be pulverized as can the silk beads . Acetate may be distinguished from all other fibers in that it will dissolve in a drop of acetone ( except Arnel ) . The American Standard L22 * for rayon and acetate fabrics is an attempt to classify the minimum performance of classes of merchandise and so label them that an ordinary consumer is protected . The manufacturer will voluntarily label with three colors : Green ? for " Go " ? washable up to 160 ? F. ; Amber ? for " Caution " ? for materials washable in water up to 105 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for materials which must he dry-cleaned . Other specifications for 51 end uses based on 31 test methods will be similarly reported , as creaseresistance ( degree and duration ) and color fastness ( under varied conditions ) . It is impossible for most of us to identify the 400 textile finishes now applied to rayon and the more than 300 which can be applied to acetate ; hence , this service will prove of great benefit to those who check the labels . The FTC in 1951 ruled that somewhere on the label the fabric name must be used if made of rayon or acetate , though it does not have to he adjoining the fabric as rayon satin or acetate taffeta as was the case in 1937 ; it still is not mandatory to give facts on cleaning and care . Nylon because it is thermoplastic can be formed to a permanent shape ( hose ) , requires special care in heat-setting to keep the cloth grain perfect for correct cutting and fitting of garments . It produces very permanent heat-set pleats . It is not absorbent , thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dipped not rubbed , dries quickly , and needs little ( but some ) ironing . If woven or knit in porous construction it is comfortable for warm days ; if of close weave it becomes a wind-breaker . To lessen static and render more ? Developed by technical groups with the American Standards Association , Inc. , 70 E. Forty-fifth Street , New York 17.  | comfortable try wearing cotton underwear with a nylon dress or vice versa . In blends nylon furnishes strength , stiffness , shrinkageresistance if 15 ? 60 per cent is used : a washable lightweight tweed , 85 per cent wool , 15 per cent nylon , Sanforlan processed , is ideal for campus separates . Taslan connotes textured nylon used now in anklets ? lightweight , nonabsorbent and free from pilling . The tendency for nylon to pucker along seams has been improved but since this occurs chiefly on straight lengthwise seams , select a pattern with bias seams as gored skirts not straight ones ; crosswise seams pucker somewhat but lengthwise most , bias least . Orlon , the bulky fiber , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft and downy ) , resistance to deterioration by gases and sunlight ( for curtains , sport wear ) . Alone or in blends it is fine for sweaters , with wool for pleated jersey , and for white . It pills , but less than nylon or Dacron ; holds its shape through many washings ( even fleece coats ) ; stays white ( in uniforms ) ; is acidproof ( coveralls ) . Creases may be put in or pressed out with a moderate iron ( at rayon setting ) . Milliken 's Lorette ( 55 per cent Orlon , 45 per cent wool ) has been extremely serviceable and popular ? while washable it looks better dry cleaned . Static effect is reduced by certain detergents . ( Orlon slacks may wrap around one 's legs . ) White Orlon will pick up dark lint and " pill " ; so do n't wear with dark wool skirts and coats nor wash with colored clothes . Dacron adds wrinkle-resistance , holds a press , is tough and durable ; spots wash out . It is very strong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort the year around . It tailors well . It combines with cotton for semi-sheer and linen-crisp dresses and blouses ; with elastic for girdles . Socks tend to pill . Linings , interlinings , and thread must also be Dacron if a suit is n't to pucker . Neckties do not wrinkle badly . Dynel resists acids and chemicals , melts at a very low heat ( below rayon ) ; pills ; takes laundering better than dry cleaning ; is best as a blend . Vicara ( from corn ) blends well in knit goods , has cashmere-like softness and lightness , adds drape to rayon and cotton , absorbency to nylon ; washes easily , does not shrink or stretch . Acrilan creates static therefore best in blends as heathers ; lacks abrasion-resistance , is wrinkle-resistant. 100 per cent Acrilan is satisfactory in sweaters and jersey ? washable with little ironing , without sag or stretch , in rich colors ; also used in suitings , fake furs , inter-  | linings ; and pebble crepes ( 80 per cent Acrilan , 20 per cent Orlon ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combinations are easier to use than those of 100 per cent man-made fibers . They are difficult to shrink the ease from sleeves and hems ; the machine needle penetrates with difficulty ? skipped stitches and puckers result . Needles and scissors are dulled so must be replaced . BARGAINS In shopping for fabrics of man-made ? ( as for natural ) ? fibers avoid sleazy constructions and weaves which " pick up , " become fuzzy , take a shine easily when pressed , or wrinkle badly . Manufacturers have made many improvements to overcome some of these characteristics , usually in the form of special chemical finishes . More and more the consumer must consult the label . No one fiber has everything . When you buy tempting bargains that soon prove to be shoddy merchandise , you are not only cheating yourself but you are helping to undermine conditions for all the producers ; from the farmer who grows the cotton or sheep ? to the people who spin and weave it and those who sell it . If consumers never bought poor stuff , there would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Each time you buy an article you are voting for it ? whether it be good or whether it be poor . Consumer-resistance to prices too high for the quality will help considerably in price control . To be a better judge of fabrics you should have some courses in textiles to discover the inherent nature of each fiber and to develop generalizations or principles to enable you to know exactly what to expect of fabrics of one fiber , of blends of various fibers , of the different weaves and of different finishes . You will know better what to choose for your purpose and how to care for it . KNOW BRANDS As a part of becoming fashion conscious and as a way of discovering some of the better grades of merchandise , begin to acquaint yourself with the names of certain manufacturers that have always stood for high quality . It is easy to be led astray in the field of trademarks and trade names and brands , yet you should know what they represent . It is sometimes true that the best brand of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products of another . Not all brands or brand names represent a stationary quality . But some do . Your experience and that of your instructor should enable you gradually to recognize the status of the brands most commonly found in your locality . Read the acts ? sometimes they are more informative than labels on the same merchandise . Read the fine print and check every asterisk . HOW MUCH SHOULD I PAY ? After deciding on the type of garment and fabric , consider the cost from several angles . Your teacher can give practical suggestions , for she will know the local market better than you do and can tell whether 39 or 79 cents or $1.79 will be necessary for a good quality of cotton fabric . War , government regulations , economic inflation , and economic depression are conditions that will affect the cost of cloth . In the 1860 's calico sold for one dollar a yard ; in the 1930 's , we paid 10 to 20 cents a yard for 80 square percale and when we found gingham and balloon cloth , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1950 's many beautiful " city " and " winter " cottons and imports sold from $3.00 to $5.00 per yard . It is not too much to pay $5.00 to $8.00 for a fine grade of wool , 54 " wide . However , you may find good blends for $4.00 that suit your pocketbook better . Keep in mind that the garment you make in class is a learning experience and that a higher price might be paid than you normally pay if it gives you any advantage in ease or breadth of learning . Put the extra cost down to an educational item in your budget rather than an extra wardrobe item . We find that garments made in college classes are usually so well-made and styled that the girls wear them much longer with satisfaction than ready-made garments . Can you afford to pay so much ? Will you have the cash available ? Does it fit into your budgeted plan for clothes ? If it seems too high , perhaps you can find a job to earn extra money to pay for this extra value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Learn to make these decisions for yourself . Do n't depend on your mother too much at this time . This is a learning experience for you . You should shop for yourself and decide for yourself . If you should happen to choose unwisely , profit by that experience too . Your teacher will not say , " I. told you so ! " but rather suggest how you might have chosen better . Do not be irritated or have hurt feelings  | when such suggestions are made . It is a part of a teacher 's responsibility to give them and a part of yours to accept and benefit from them . ECONOMY AND PHILOSOPHY IN BUYING YARD GOODS 1 . When several grades are available in the material you have decided upon , usually the most costly is a luxury material , the refinement of which you may be able to do without . The lowest grade is usually too sleazy for a dress or not worth your labor to make . The middle grades are usually the best buys from the standpoint of durability . But be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium , and low grades . Sometimes the " best " grade in a mail order catalogue is only average grade in the general market . 2 . It is wiser to buy the best quality in a price grouping you can afford rather than a low grade in the more expensive class of merchandise . For example , silks are more expensive than acetates and rayons . It is wiser to buy a good grade of acetate peau de soic than a lightweight grade of pure silk taffeta . The acetate may be bought for $2.98 , is firmer , and tailors better than the thin taffeta for $5.98 per yard . At the end of the season the silk is slimsy , and may tend to split . 3 . Spend the bulk of your money on staples not novelties , solids not prints . 4 . Do not pay for special finishes unless you have special need for them . Will your dress need to be mothproofed and water-repellent ? Does your evening dress need to be sunfast ? 5 . Invest in good material and take pains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two poorer ones . You might remodel some old garment for your second best . Do not buy too handsome material if it will make your accessories appear shabby . 6 . Remnants at half price are not economical if they cause you to buy too much or too little or cause you to produce a dress of ordinary design . 7 . Consider fabric in relation to your pattern , but buy your pattern first , make alterations , and buy just exactly the amount needed . Saving i/6 ? ' /a yard may enable you to buy better buttons and other accessories . Buying too little is false economy . 8 . Simple cuts , not too full nor too intricate , require less yardage and less time . Since such styles are conservative , you may wear them more seasons . Double-breasted coats , swagger coats , very circular , very bias , very draped , and very pleated skirts require more cloth than straight cuts and hence cost more . 9 . A few wide pleats are cheaper than many narrow ones because they require less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look better made by a commercial pleater , and this service adds to your expense . Also , cleaners charge more for such pleats . 10 . Napped material , large repeats in florals or plaids , up-and-down  | designs , and stripes require more time in planning the layout and usually more yardage . 11 . Pieces cut on the bias require about 1/3 more yardage . 12 . Some ribbed and striped materials cut to better advantage with some pieces placed crosswise . Be certain that such plans result in satisfactory design and durability before you decide to save yardage in this manner . 13 . Buy only the needed findings such as belts and buttons . Take good care of them . They may be used on other garments . Do n't buy extra buttons unless you are habitually careless and you should overcome this tendency . 14 . Collars , pockets , belts , scarves may sometimes be lined with a less expensive material . Such linings also make these parts less bulky . 15 . Ready-made trimmings are great timesavers , but are expensive if distinctive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Novelties are generally more acceptable for the younger set and for sport clothes . However , a really high grade ornament may enhance a garment which is a little too plain . Using a handsome button or piece of jewelry from some other garment is one solution . Try three handsome buttons rather than five or six cheap-looking ones . On the other hand , half a dozen plain pearl or bone buttons often look smarter or more appropriate than a single fancy one , poor in design or quality . 16 . Self-trims such as loops , belts , buckles , covered buttons , arrowheads , set-in pockets , frogs , tassels , if well-made , add distinction and sometimes elegance . Such work reduces cost of decoration but increases your labor costs . 17 . When estimating the final cost , divide the total cost by the number of wearings . Although the original investment may be high the cost per wearing , including the cost of cleaning , of a good all-wool , general style coat may be far lower than the cost per wearing of a lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . 18 . Handle your fabric or your garment carefully both in the store and in the making . Do n't muss , wrinkle , or soil it . Keep it on a hanger during construction so that it will appear new and fresh when completed . Have the clerk roll velvets , chintz , and similar fabrics . Wools. especially , and blends require a relaxing period ? try not to wear the same skirt two days in a row . 19 . Cutting off grain , whether through haste , carelessness , or the desire to save a few inches , is a false economy . The resulting difficulties in fitting and stitching or the resulting unbalanced appearance of the garment will detract from your satisfaction with it . 20 . Begin and end any purchase by a clear mental ( or notebook picture of color and line most becoming to you , its suitability to your present wardrobe , accessories , and occasions for wear ; its expected life ? wear , care and fashion wise ; its price in relation to your budget ? in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After having made a choice and completed the dress to the best of your ability , secure as much satisfaction as you can from it . Enjoy it .  | appreciate it , you may need even to educate your family as to the superior qualities of this garment . Wear it with an air and with a smile but without conceit ; simply be your natural self and wear it with poise , good posture , and the kind of self-confidence that come from a good job well done .

This so-called " consumer movement " has produced many valuable suggestions to help us make the most of what we have and to help us secure the most of what we want . A background of appreciation of the men and women who produce the merchandise , and of world conditions affecting the distribution of the things we desire is essential to the educated woman of today . Why should we object to a dollar blouse ? A knowledge of present laws that protect a consumer ( Chap . 4 ) , as well as a knowledge of laws that protect the retailer and the manufacturer , would seem as necessary as knowing how to make change , how to compute interest , or how to combine colors . The following suggestions are simply an introduction to better buying . A further study of textiles and consumer economics will enable you to understand and formulate principles , to understand market conditions , price fluctuations , problems of distribution and the need for legislation . GENERAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sizes , and number needed . Carry samples for matching supplies and accessories . Have sizes of other members of the family if you ever buy for them . Sizes in ready-mades are more standardized than formerly but a try-on is the only way to be sure . 2 . Do not take unfair advantage of other people 's time . Be courteous to salespeople and other shoppers . Shop at less busy hours . Do not always ask for special delivery and return privileges . 3 . Read labels to find out what the product is made of , how it is made , how it will perform , how to care for it , how to use it , who made it or who is backing it . Consult salespeople and labels to discover differences in quality among products of different prices . Buy with caution and skepticism if no label is available . Machine washability is of no advantage in most tailored garments because construction ( interfacings , etc. ) would be disturbed . 4 . Give reasons for not buying without being aggressively unpleasant .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or select other products the next time . 5 . A garment purchased on the spur of the moment or for just one occasion seldom fits into a wardrobe perfectly unless you have planned on it for some time and then suddenly find just what you have been looking for . Have a wardrobe plan . Stick to it and do not indulge in " impulse " buying . 6 . Plan far enough ahead so that you can look around and have time to wait for suitable market offerings . Decide early on the type of hat or blouse needed to complete your suit ? do not wait until the Saturday before Easter to buy your Easter hat . 7 . Have a price in mind before shopping . If you have a plan this problem is practically settled . If you have extra money in reserve it may be wise to spend more than you planned if the garment seems to promise more uses in your wardrobe . By shopping around you may be able to save . On thebther hand , if you find the planned price entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than make a sudden decision and overspend . Do not feel sorry for yourself because you have a price limit , but admit that such a limit is a challenge . 8 . Do not buy anything without considering it in relation to yourself and all other parts of your costume . What alteration or accessory would be necessary to make it right ? 9 . A good shopper checks prices and protects herself from so-called " bargains " by being well-informed on grades of quality . Thus she can take advantage of markdowns at the end of the season . It is important to be able to recognize the age or lasting qualities of the style as well as the fabric in marked-down bargains . Shop around , but in comparison shopping be sure that you are able to identify similar qualities and colors and carry them in your mind if not in an actual sample . 10 . Ask yourself why you are so eager to have or buy the things you see . Be conscious of what or who is affecting your choices . Psychology should be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you permit your friends , the radio , advertising , desire for change , a clerk , a desire to keep up with the others , or cool judgment and good taste to guide you in your choices ? 11 .

Have you taken any unfair advantage of someone 's time in the garment you are buying or wearing ? Was it made by underpaid workers or under unsanitary conditions ? How do you know ? 13 . It is not enough to learn what should be purchased or what is a good quality if we can not find such on the market or if it is n't labeled so we can recognize it . Every educated woman should help groups working to bring about better practices in making and merchandising goods . Belonging to , paying dues in , and working on committees of your college home economics club or your state home economics association is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can develop good judgment in buying by consciously applying the above suggestions . Better judgment will follow as you take other courses where you study economic problems of the home , art , and psychology . A buying problem is always complex ? try to see these three sides of it ? and as you progress in home economics you will see the solutions becoming more and more simple . BUYING READY-MADES It is often difficult to find a ready-made garment that is satisfactory in every detail at a price one can afford to pay . The idealist is inclined to set up a long list of specifications that are quite desirable , but the average girl has to exercise judgment in deciding which ones to omit in order to secure a garment within her reach . A good buyer , either the consumer or the department store buyer , must be aware of all the little differences that affect the usefulness and the price charged . There may be slight differences to you between a $9.98 and a $10.98 wash dress , but what are the real differences ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you tell whether a dress is worth $16.50 or $24.50 when you see it ? Until you can judge these values , shop at the most reliable stores with the most reliable salespersons . Ask for brands that have proved satisfactory to you . Look at clothes in windows , on mannequins , and on racks . Confine most of your looking to your price range . Do not try on a dress if it is definitely poor in design , if it has a poor color combination , if it is too high-priced , if it is distinctly below your standards of workmanship or fabric quality , or if it is not what you need . However , some of the best fitting clothes , due to their simplicity , do not look their best dangling limply on a hanger and need to be tried on to be appreciated . Examine the material , the workmanship , and the labels . Judge the fabric quality by the same standards you apply in purchasing yard goods ( Chap . 4 ) . It is more difficult sometimes because the labels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . You want to know whether you are getting wool , acetate , or Orlon , what percentages of fibers of any kind are present , if it is wrinkle-resistant , if the colors are fast to sun , washing , and perspiration , and the possible extent of shrinkage . ( See p. 150 . ) Good construction in a garment implies that it is not cut skimpily in size and that it is cut correctly as to grain . If off grain , the garment does not feel comfortable , hold its shape , wear well , or hang  | right . You will recognize grain better after you learn to sew , but avoid garments that sag when tried on , garments with the sleeve or collar cut crosswise , and garments in which stripes and plaids do not match . If one sleeve sets well and the other one does not , the sleeve is probably o$ grain and fitting will probably not help it . Are seams , pleats , and hems wide enough to set right and permit needed changes ? Avoid seams that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piecing . Are the stitchings , fasteners , and plackets neat and strong and suitable for the material or kind of dress ? Are facings and hems too conspicuous ? Do they draw ? Try on the garment for correctness of size , becomingness , fit , and its ability to combine with the rest of your wardrobe . For fit look first at the shoulder-armhole area , then at length of waist and length of skirt . The latter two are easier to alter , but see if there is material with which to do it . If the neckline bulges away from the body , you are probably square-shouldered or the shoulder pads are too high . Avoid sleeves set too high on the shoulder or falling off the shoulder . Sit down , walk , and reach to see if the dress is full enough to be pretty , comfortable , and efficient . If the sleeves are too tight or too short , the hip line too tight , pleats spread , bust line too tight , back or armholes draw , sleeves twist , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a poorly cut garment . Try the next size larger . Decide whether you or the store can make a professional-looking alteration . How much is charged ? College girls as a rule should buy misses ' sizes . The very tiny girl ( who is 5 ' 4 " ? 5 ' 6 " ) should look for a junior size which is smaller in the waist and hips and shorter , more youthful in style . The short full figure should look for half-sizes or custom-sizes ? with more fullness in the waist , hips , and sleeve cap , a shorter waist and narrow shoulders . Improved sizing of ready-mades is on the way . Mail order concerns are following a classification based on measures from the Women 's Army Corps : 4 classes ( misses ' , women 's , juniors ' , halfsizes ) ; 3 heights ( Tall , Regular , Short ) ; and 3 hips ( average , slender ? , full+ ) . But of course we would not expect every dress design to be carried in all 36 possibilities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basement to be comparable to size 12 in the more expensive lines . It will be wonderful when size 14 is not tagged a 10 in coats , 34 in blouses , 36 in sweaters , 5 in panties . You can help to bring this about . If style and becomingness are more important than durability , as  | in an evening dress , you can somewhat overlook quality of fabric , stitching , and finishing details , but you should pay less . For casual wear do not permit fashion , a novelty fabric , or a style that will be " dated " next year to cloud your judgment . But do get some element in it up to date ! Consider the cost in time , money , and energy to keep the dress fresh and good-looking . Read the label to find out how to clean it . Will the belt clean as well as the rest of the dress ? Will trimmings require special cleaning ? Is it going to be a nuisance to baste on a fresh collar every time the dress is worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be combined in one dress . There should not be too many layers in a wash dress . Fine pleats are hard to launder ( unless nylon ) and expensive to have cleaned . What changes in fitting , construction , or decoration can you make yourself and which ones are to be expected at the price paid ? Learning to fit garments is one of your most valuable assets . A few courses in garment construction will help you guide the fitter in the fitting room , help you recognize a good fit in a ready-made , and enable you to make these changes yourself if necessary . Do not allow frills , and cheap decorations to blind you to other faults . Dressmaking details well executed such as a taped hem , slide fastener placket , taped waistline , lingerie-strap keepers ; high grade , smooth pearl buttons ; shaped shoulder pads , reinforced pockets , buttonholes in place of snap fasteners may be found in better dresses . Some of these may mean more to you than others , and they all add to the cost . Specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " wide , chain stitched and cord stitched seams ; top-stitching unevenly spaced , long stitches less than fourteen per inch , poor tension , thread not matching in color , low grade thread , thread ends left loose ; holes punched at ends of darts , waistline seam ( joining blouse and skirt ) made before underarm seams , hem at bottom of sleeve made before lengthwise seam ; puckers in neck binding or facing ; skimpy pleats , uneven width in pleats ; plackets under 9 " long , too few snap fasteners in a placket ; buttonholes wrong size , cut off grain , corners not finished neatly ; excessive machine shirring , machine hemstitching , or picoted edges , bias binding i/a " wide or over , with raw edges showing ; buttons poor in design , of imitation materials , not sewed on well nor through reinforcement ; hems machine-stitched , conspicuous , narrow , uneven , or finished with cheap tape .  | Fine , hand-made or hand-finished details of decoration are the earmarks of good tailoring . They add considerably to the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can incorporate these touches in the garments you make or add them to ready-mades . Narrow piped buttonholes , worked buttonholes , set-in pockets , arrowheads , clusters of tucks , and hemstitching are a few of them ( Chap . 26 ) . BUYING COATS AND SUITS Before buying a coat , be very firm with yourself and decide how much you can afford to spend , how long you will have to make it do and what color and design will be most suitable ( Fig. 11 , p. 70 ) . If the coat or suit is striking in cut , color combination , or texture , it can not be used so interchangeably with other costume parts . A winter coat for warmth needs a wide front lap , a closed neck , close-fitting wrists ( perhaps under-sleeves when wide sleeves are in fashion ) . Spring wraps may be single-breasted or Tuxedo style . Cardigan styles ( collarless ) will require a scarf or fur neckpiece for colder days , but are less tailored looking and more useful as basis for general year-round wear . Coats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closenapped cloths are excellent for general wear coats . They do not show dust , dirt , or wrinkles . Gabardine and hard worsteds are better for suits . They wear well but often show shine and spots . The fleece woolens , popular in the polo type of sport coats , have been satisfactory only in good qualities . The poor grades fade , sag , and pill . Rub briskly to see if the fluff rubs off easily . If you could hold it to the light you would see thick and thin places in a lower grade . Camel 's hair and other special fibers are soft , lightweight , and warm , but more expensive than sheep 's wool . They are best in natural colors . Softer napped fabrics like suede cloth , boucle , and broadcloth are for dressy wear and not so serviceable ( see p. 156 ) . Tropical worsteds , blends with silk , mohair , Dacron give excellent service and looks for suits . Orlon fleeces are practical in shorties because washable . In a dusty area , do not choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribbed materials like bengaline . If the cloth stretches much it will soon get out of shape . A well-balanced weave without long floats , loops , or heavy knots will not sag or wear out quickly . Look for a label that guarantees against fading , shrinking , sagging , or pilling . If at all possible insist on 100 per cent virgin wool ( see p. 154 ) .  | If you do not purchase at the first of the season but wait until December or January when the prices break , you can get a better buy for your money if you look around for a classic or conservative style . Spring suits go on sale in summer . To have a coat relined requires considerable effort and expense . Even if you can do the work yourself , it will cost five or ten dollars . Would n't it be better to pay more for a guaranteed lining in the first place ? Acetate makes a good lining as it is durable , perspiration-resistant , and often slipproof . Weighted silks we hope are a thing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is found only in expensive coats . Two special kinds of satin linings merit consideration for extra warmth , fleece-backed and metal- ( aluminum ) coated ; both require dry-cleaning . Fur-lined coats are expensive , probably novelties . Often the fur is a very low grade . Sport coats and raincoats may be lined with contrasting flannel of wool or wool-like blends . The lining should not show from the right side of the coat and should be loose enough so that there are no pulled or drawn places on the outside . Zipped-in linings are often practical . Interlinings of all wool or blends with wool are desirable in winter coats . Napped cotton or mixtures are sometimes used , but they add to the weight and not so much to the warmth . Woven interlinings are less bulky than quilted ones . Coats and jackets of suits require the very best tailoring and fitting you can afford . Begin with the correct size . The most important point to observe is the fit in the shoulder-armhole area . It should be smooth , neither too narrow nor too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eased smoothly into the armholes , set straight and balanced , and be just the right length ? cover the wristbone . Padding at the shoulders should be smooth and give the silhouette in fashion now without appearing overpadded . Good tailoring has the padding tacked to the interfacing so that it will not shift in wear or cleaning . The next important point is the fit of the neckline . The collar should fit up at the base of the neck ? not stand away nor be too high and rub . Neither the lapels nor the sleeves should have crease lines pressed in . The outer edge of the collar should completely cover the neckline seam . The front facing in a good jacket or coat is tacked invisibly to the interfacing so that it does not curl or slip beyond the edge . The collar and lapels do not curl , and their underside is not visible along the edges . Hand-picked edges prevent this occurrence and  | give a soft hand-tailored finish , adding to the cost . The front seams , neck , and armholes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lapels , and collar are tacked inside diagonally and invisibly to prevent sagging or getting out of shape and to give a rounded contour where needed . The lower edge of coat and sleeves in the better grades has a bias muslin interfacing . These lower edges should show no evidences of hemming . Look to see if designs match from right to left , if the garment is cut on the grain , and if it sets in balance from front to back , as well as from left to right . Cheaper coats show such defects as these : sleeves set in armholes so that side seam of coat and sleeve are joined in one operation ; the collar joined in one seam between coat and facing creating the bulk of six layers ; the seam edges not graded ; threads not matching the fabric ; lining rarely tacked to the body along seams ; seams underpressed or not pressed open ; the lining machine stitched in place to front facing ; a closed lower edge in a long coat ; fraying buttonholes ; cheap fasteners . Better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lining tacked inside several places along each seam , hemmed separately from coat , and tacked with slip tacks , lining slip hemmed to facing . Jackets have the lining slip hemmed at the lower edge far enough back to ensure looseness without sagging . Become acquainted with brands of coats and suits in your favorite stores . In what price range does each come ? Read all tags and labels . Save them and your receipted bill for future protection . Reliable firms and manufacturers make good their claims . Overpressing takes the life out of wool . It is better not to wear a wool garment too constantly but to give it a resting period . Wrinkles shake out after a period of hanging . Frequent brushing gets rid of moth eggs and fine particles of dust which cut the fibers . Ask the cleaner for a " soft " press , not a " hard " press often used on men 's suits . RAIN WEAR For occasional showers , the inexpensive plastic raincoat is satisfactory . It is water proof ? but it generally stiffens in cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment is a  | water-repellent , windproof coat that will cover your suit or dress completely . It may be reversible and need not be drab in color . A lightweight closely woven fabric is best . Oxford , twill or satin weave cottons and synthetics with water-repellent finishes ( Zelan , Cravenette , Unisec ) are proving extremely popular and practical . Silicone resin finishes on suits repel stains , sudden showers , tears , and hard wear as well . A raincoat that shrinks is the poorest of buys ; many satin ones do . Examine seams , pockets , ventilators , and amount of overlap ; a double layer across the shoulders affords twice the protection . Buy for use before looks . The label should tell whether the coat is shower- , rain- , or storm-resistant and whether it can be laundered or dry-cleaned . Buy rubbers or galoshes to fit walking shoes . Have them snug without being tight . They need not be sloppy and muddy-looking . Select an umbrella to harmonize with the coat . A good fur felt beret is better looking than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fur trimming on a coat is a luxury . It provides warmth to body and soul . Since furs are more costly than cloth and since there are so many " bargains , " it is well to learn as many helpful facts as possible before making such an investment . First , it is better to buy from a local reputable dealer who is more likely to observe the rules and regulations established to protect the consumer . He will make adjustments and repairs if necessary , whereas a peddler or " fly-by-night " concern will not . Do not " bite " on August sales , loud advertising of " terrific bargains , " or the " wholesale " racket . A reliable dealer asks the same price from every customer . A label saying , " Proper care will prolong its wear , " etc. , means that you take all the risk . Labels must tell the facts about the kind and grade of fur . Descriptions must precede the true name of the fur , as seal-dyed muskrat ( " Hudson seal " ) which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furs must be labeled . If the fur is made of pieces , not full skins , it must be so labeled . Be sure that your bill of sale includes the proper name of the fur . Find out the names of several kinds of furs within your price range by reading and by looking in different stores . Find out their  | relative durability . Ask to be shown the same kind of fur at two or three prices with explanations for the difference . Ask to see the written statement furnished with each coat . Long haired furs like raccoon or fox do not look well on short , stocky figures . A fundamental rule is to buy the best grade in a price level you can afford , not a low grade of a more expensive type than you can afford . For example , buy a good grade of rabbit , pony , goat , or calf rather than a low grade of lamb or squirrel . A good seal-dyed muskrat ( Hudson seal ) is better than a low grade , poorly finished , real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabbit ) called Sealine is better than a low grade Hudson seal . A good cloth coat is a better buy than a coat of cheap , mangy-looking fur . Red fox , monkey fur , leopard , bright colors in furs , strong contrasts of color in the same piece are likely to be conspicuous or to be imitations and hence will not satisfy you long . In buying a fur coat be sure the size is ample ( short if worn much in a car ) , that the lining carries a guarantee , that the style is conservative enough to last several years , that the leather part does not feel brittle or stiff , that the leather and nap both feel uniformly thick throughout , that there is not too much irregular piecing , that the edges are folded over on the wrong side like hems ( the Ivwer grades have scams right on the edge ) . Tipping , blending , pointing , dropping , leathering are legitimate processes that cut the price to you and therefore should be mentioned on the label . Some skins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the back . Examine the underarm sections for weak skins or mismatching . A good dealer invites inspection of the underside . A good fur should not shed much ; it should not look mangy , dull , matted , or lifeless but appear lustrous and bright . The greatest enemies of fur are moths , heat , sun , and friction . Do not have fur dry-cleaned , but have it sawdust-cleaned . Do not put it near a stove or radiator . Do not brush or comb it but keep it fluffed . Air frequently but not in the sun . Do not pack tightly in your closet . Avoid friction caused by jewelry , purse , or hat rubbing against it . Loosen your coat when you sit down and raise it a little . A soft scarf will double the wear of the collar . Have small holes and rips in seams repaired at once . Cold storage is the best moth prevention , but a big box or tin container in a cool place is safe if a generous amount of dichloricide is used . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In buying skirts apply the same principles used in purchasing dresses . Select a skirt by hip measure , then see if the belt needs to be adjusted to fit you . Examine the possibilities of letting it out . Separate skirts should provide more freedom than suit skirts through pleats or more flare in the gores . Sit and walk in a skirt to test . Do n't buy one that rides up . A well fitted skirt should balance on the figure from right to left and front to back . There should be no crosswise or diagonal wrinkles caused by too snug a fit through the hips or waist . The cheaper skirts have no slide fastener in the placket and often use coarse cotton facings and visible underlaps . The plaids do not match , belts are pieced ; pleats , seams , and hems are skimpy ; the stitching coarse . The better skirts are made of all wool of a good grade which wrinkles less , is superior in color , and stays in press longer than a skirt of part wool or of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is fairly firm in weave . A wool skirt should be drycleaned unless the label proclaims that it has received one of the new shrink-resisting finishes . Skirts for bad weather should be waterrepellent ( Silicone resin-finished ) . Less expensive materials include some of the rayons and blends with special crease-resistant finishes . Washable dirndl type skirts are made of seersucker , crash , rayon crepe , silk , linen , " permanently " pleated cotton , acetate , and blends of man-made fibers pleated or gathered . BLOUSES AND SWEATERS In buying blouses apply the same principles used in purchasing dresses . For suit blouses avoid materials that crush or wrinkle easily like taffeta and organdy and designs with puffed sleeves . Details in the better blouses include matching thread and 14 ? 16 stitches per inch . Tops of pockets are neatly reinforced . Piped buttonholes are narrow , neat , and flat . Machine-made buttonholes have close stitching with ends not raveled out . Buttons , if pearl , are not scaly but uniform in thickness and sewed on with a shank with stitches in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be sufficient overlap to prevent the underslip from showing through the buttonholes.  | Sleeves are not skimpy in width , but neatly eased into the armhole . Short sleeves have a tailored finish such as a band or two rows of machine stitching instead of hand sewing . Long sleeves have wrist placket and cuff not too bulky , with neat sewing . If the cuff is finished by hand , no sewing is visible on the outside ; if by machine , the tailored stitching is all around the cuff , not just across the top . The neckline or collar finish must be well tailored . Collarless blouses are easier to launder and set off jewelry well . Look for wide facings . If interfacings are used , will it launder or must it be dry-cleaned ? Many of these details are not possible on a five-dollar blouse . Decide which ones in addition to fit and quality of fabric you must have . Which ones can you supply by a few deft touches at home ? Dressy blouses are frequently disappointing , partly due to the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long skirt already in the wardrobe . Overblouses are particularly difficult to fit . Sequins do not stand up well in frequent dry cleaning . Circular jabots are easily laundered whereas pleated frills except nylon soon cease to be attractive . Sweaters , both cardigans and pull-overs , are still the college girls ' favorite . Orlons are probably more popular than wool due to ease in washing ( Chap . 21 ) . Since some shed , the dyed-to-match flannel , tweed or jersey skirt is equally popular . Acrilan 100 per cent and nylon with vicara ( for softness ) wash equally well . In solutiondyed black and gray colors they are most practical and are fairly inexpensive . Cashmere sweaters cost more than ordinary sweaters ? they are finer and softer . Shetland wool is the fine lacy wool usually found in imported English sweaters . There are many imitations , more especially in scarves . Angora sweaters are made of angora rabbits ' hair spun with wool . They cost less than all wool , shed easily , and do not launder so satisfactorily . French spun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than English spun . The former term means a soft full feeling , not that they were made in France . Zephyr yarns are high grade worsted . In buying , try the sweater on to secure long enough shoulder seams , the right sleeve length , ample fullness in the bust , yet snugness at the waistline . Look for firm ribbing . Fine gauge sweaters are more resilient than coarse gauge , which shrink and lose their shape . Stretch to see that the sweater is elastic and springs back to its original size and shape . Pockets and opening , if any , should be flat  | Figure and firm , buttonholes reinforced . Styling is best built in by fullfashioning not seams . Hand-knit sweaters are to be treasured . However , they often lack the style of a factory-made sweater . Contrasting colors , yokes , and puffed sleeves do not belong on sweaters and complicate the cleaning ( Fig. 33 ) . Washing is easy if you take pains ( Chap . 21 ) , drycleaning better if you do n't know how . Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not on hangers . They often look better worn with shoulder pads . Underarm perspiration causes wool to fade and mat . Cardigans are fine with casual dresses if they fit without bumps . They are better if short and worn over sleeveless styles . Removable collars help to keep the neckline clean . A present fashion is to decorate sweaters with beads and embroidery to make them dressy ? unless subdued they are not suitable for work or early day but lovely for late day or dates . HATS In shopping for a hat , wear the dress and coat with which it will be most frequently worn ( Figures 28 , p. 136 and 34 . Allow the  | Figure salesgirl to place the hat while you are seated , but stand before a full-length mirror to observe the total effect . The looks of the hat on you is what gives it style , but quality of materials should be considered too . The clerk should be able to tell you what the hat is made of and to show you two or three grades of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low- and medium-priced hats . Select a hat in about the same quality range as your clothes , so that neither one cheapens the other .  | A fur felt is far better than a wool felt . Spring felts are a little finer and softer than fall felts . You can tell a wool felt because it will feel grainy , rough , stiff , while a fur felt is soft and silky . As the stiffness in a wool felt is due to shellac , after awhile it loses its shape . The better wool felts are of uniform thickness and color and not so boardy . " Ash can " felts are renovated felts which are not as good as new felts but legitimate if the consumer is informed . Straws , synthetics , and fabric-covered frames do not stand weather as well as felts , but are light in weight and cooler . Novelty weaves soon pull out , white often turns yellow . Durable natural straws such as leghorn or coconut in classic shapes are good investments . Baku , ballibuntl , hangkoks , panamas are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rice paper . Manila hats are made of bamboo fiber . Most of these are casual types . Bands of grosgrain ribbon seem most appropriate while veils do not . Milan is an excellent straw for small hats , especially in black or navy blue . Black , dark blue , or brown taffeta , faille , ribbon , or knits make practical , attractive hats for summer and between seasons . Feathers and feather hats , cotton flowers soon become bedraggled . Shiny satin , crushed bright velvet , and excessive machine shirring are characteristics of many " bargain " hats . Classic styles like the sailor , bowler , beret , coolie , turban , pillbox , Breton roller , cloche , Tyrolean , and mushroom shapes certainly offer the youthful college girl all the variety needed . The season 's style varies chiefly in height and width of crown , and in decoration ( Fig. 34 ) . If your clothes are mostly tailored , do n't buy a dressy hat for general wear . On the other hand , a severe suit needs softening touches in neckwear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or decoration needs a simpler hat but not a sport style . The color depends on your wardrobe color scheme and your own coloring . If you have two hats have one that matches your coat and basic dress . If all the major accessories are of the basic color , having one hat in contrast gives one quite a lift . A veil softens and modifies the face and increases the feminine effect , but since it is not appropriate for morning or general wear , it should be removable . A veil is too dressy for most casual clothes and accessories , and for fabrics like gingham , or denim , or prints . Try the hat with your coat and without your coat ( Fig. 34 ) . Avoid a hat that rubs the coat collar . Some hats look best when  | placed a little to one side , usually down near the right eyebrow and with a lift on the left side . Many hats , however , are made straight to be worn straight . It is unwise to buy a hat that requires an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the width or length of your hair style slightly . The angle of the trimming or its massing may be changed to improve its becomingness . Bows and streamers may be modified . See if a bandeau , elastic , or pins are needed to make the hat more secure . Be careful to get the correct head size if you are buying a sailor or cloche . Suggestions for choosing becoming and suitable hats are found in Chap . 3 . In general , however , the most important consideration is proportion or balance with your figure and costume ? do n't let the hat either overbalance or underbalance the effect . A fluffy , bulky fur needs a trim-looking hat like a pillbox . An afternoon type of dress with flowers or jeweled accessories can not be right with a snap brim , tailored hat . A small flower-covered hat ideal for afternoon would be wrong worn on a morning shopping tour with a plaid or gabardine sport dress . Usually a flowered print dress is not at its best with a flower-bedecked hat , even though it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and peasant kerchiefs are out of place on a city street . The snap brim , bowler , or cart wheel are not " just right " for business . A street hat is not suitable for horseback riding . A feather hat , velvet hat , or a flowered hat is appropriate neither for school nor business . The beret , or any classic , is easily changed by an ornament , a feather , a rose , or by a pique , satin , or velvet bow to suit the season , the occasion , hair style or other features . UNDERWEAR AND ACCESSORIES Slips In recent years nylon has been almost as popular in lingerie as in hose because of the ease of washing with little or no ironing . It will not shrink nor wrinkle from washing unless the water is too hot . Puckering and pilling do occur , but tricot ( tree ' - ko ) knit crepe , and the puckered fabrics do not pucker so badly . Pilling is reduced by careful washing , and graying by consistent bleaching . In slips the static @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps . Seams and hems do ravel out readily . Acetate slips in tricot  | or satin are opaque , easily washed and the whites stay white ( Arnel , the triacetate ) . Tricot requires little or no ironing but if used set the iron lower than nylon or rayon . Rayon slips are cooler , pleasant to wear and are just as easy to wash but require longer drying and ironing . White silk , a luxury , is expensive and turns yellow after several washings . Part Dacron and part cotton slips do not cling , pleats are " permanent " and the feel of cotton is pleasant in warm weather . Tricot fabrics are warp knit ? either runproof ( two sets of warp ) or run-resistant ( one set of warp ) . Other knits sag , stretch , or shrink . Nylon , Orlon and blends are heat-set ( sometimes off grain in lower grades ) . They are more comfortable than close weaves and wear very well . Cotton slips , for warm weather or under " static " dresses that cling , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent seam slippage , have no sizing , be preshrunk . Do not buy a slip without trying it on . Buy by bust measure and length . Short stocky figures should look for half sizes . Adjusting the length by straps will change the fit in bust and hips . Stand and sit in your slip to test the hip seams and riding-up qualities . See that it is well-fitted at underarm and bust ? it should neither cup nor hang too loosely . It should cover the bra . If the hem sags , it needs fitting at bust or hips , or it is cut off grain . Bias cut slips are suitable only for slight figures . They are better if cut on a true bias , preferably of four or six gores and of alternating bias . Two-gore slips tend to twist and ride up . If the bias garment is too tight , the seams ripple , it sags at some point , cups , and rides up easily . Larger figures require a straight cut or combination cut ? straight in front with bias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A straight cut is necessary under sheers both for street and evening ; the top of the slip , as well as the waistline , color , and , silhouette , should harmonize with the cut and color of the dress . Tailored slips have more uses and if well designed can be very feminine . and attractive . Look for reinforcements , facings , nice stitching . Unusual lower edge finishes may be difficult to alter ( better if temporary ) . Stitched adjustable shoulder straps ( not ribbon ) should be attached to the fabric , not to lace . Two or three rows of edge stitching are durable and attractive . Other good features include tight lock stitches 16 per inch with flat facing ( instead  | of a binding ) , scallops , fagoting , shell stitching , permanent nylon pleating , nylon lace . Poor quality is indicated by thick bindings , hemmed tops , narrow lower hems , narrow seams , ragged embroidery , or coarse lace . Half-slips or petticoats are practical and cool . Lower edge ruffles interfere with good lines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your suit for a dollar or two . The slips with elaborate lace , pleatings , of fine silk and satin are definitely luxury articles . Buy only above the average in this class . It is risky to buy a slip with no trade name or informative hand tag . Panties Price is no indication of quality in panties . Many of the more costly have novelty trims that bear no relation to the value or service you will get . Gift sets are especially poor buys at holiday times or at special sales . The sizes are not now marked by actual measurements . Use a tape measure or hold the garment up to your waist . The waistband should stretch out to your hip measure . See that the elastic is fastened well at the ends so it will not tear out . The back should measure wider and longer than the front . The leg finish should not show through the dress . The crotch should be reinforced . Discover brands that are proportioned as you are . Some girls need longer seats , others need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch yarns ( e.g. , Helanca ) . For quality and fabrics see slips ( above ) . Nylon and silk are more durable and elastic than cotton or rayon , and wash easily . Girdles and Bras Girdles should be purchased by waist measure , brassieres by bust measures . Both should be fitted by the salesperson ? at least until you discover a good brand . But remember that you change in size . Look for fitted darts ( Figures 6 , p. 39 and 7 , p. 40 ) and good construction as in slips . For a bra take a snug measurement just under the bosom and add five inches to it , ( figures over 38 add three inches ) . For cup size : measure chest above the breasts and subtract from bra size : if the difference is one inch , wear an A cup ; two inches , B ; three inches , C ; four inches , D.  | Hose Stocking costs represent a sizable part of your budget . Nylon hose , though expensive as a first purchase , may prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give great satisfaction because of their " toughness , elasticity , great strength , " sheerness , and ease of laundering . To fit well , hose require a size corresponding to your foot measure and to leg length and girth , and should have full-fashioned shaping with a fine seam up the back . Because they are heat-set to shape we have no trouble with bagginess . If knitted too narrow they will wrinkle around the ankles . Sheerness depends on gauge ( knitted loops per 1 ? " around the hose ) and denier ( fineness , diameter , size , or weight of threads used ) . The higher the denier ( den-yer ) , the heavier is the thread ; fine , 12 ? 15 denier , is used in sheer hose . Sheer hose are the 54 gauge , 60 are extremely sheer ; 39 and 42 are coarse . In nylon hose 51 gauge , 30 denier , is most commonly used for a " walking sheer " ; 60 gauge , 15 denier for a " dress sheer . " Look at samples to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your uses and your budget . It is more economical to settle on one brand and color for a season . Select the grayer tones if black or blue are your basic colors , beige for warm basics . The tones should blend in a transition between skirt and shoes . Mesh hose are runproof , but snags in them quickly enlarge to holes . Seconds and irregulars should be labeled ? they are usually very poor " bargains . " Seamless hose attain a bare leg look and fit by changing the size of knit stitch rather than by full-fashioning . Durene and lisle are durable cottons ; Taslan , the textured nylon ; Helanca , the stretch yarn recommended for anklets . Frequent runs are usually due to wearing too tight hose supporters or careless snagging on furniture . Frequent holes in the toe are caused by too small a size or by untrimmed toenails . Holes at the heel come from faulty shoes . Shoes The most important purchase you make is that of a pair of shoes , for they affect your ensemble , your posture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and money in their selection . Have your feet measured for size ? while standing ? each time you  | buy . It is your responsibility , not the clerks ' , to secure a comfortable fit . You must check the last as well as size . The last refers to the wooden form on which the shoe is molded . Lasts vary in proportions just as girls with size 34 bust vary in height , silhouette , and shape ; discover a few brands that are built on lasts shaped like your own feet . Test to see if the length is right ? the ends of your toes should never touch the end of the shoe . There should be no pressure from the top because the cap is built too shallow . If shoes are too short or too pointed , the toes will curl under . Besides hurting feet , corns and bunions result . See if the ball of the foot lies over the widest part of the sole . The sole should not be more than ' A " narrower than the foot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sole should come directly under the big toe joint . Test to see if the heel fits . It should be snug but should not cut . It should not slip when you raise your heel . A combination last may help ; that is , a narrower heel in proportion to the rest of the shoe . Test to see if the top of the shoe fits . New shoes if properly fitted require no breaking in and should contribute to your " feeling-like-a-million . " Avoid too tight elastic or pumps that cut at the instep . Do not accept shoes that need alterations to make them comfortable such as stretching , heel lifts , gores , or inner soles . Try shoes on both feet , walk around in them , and do it when your feet are the most tired or swollen . The heels must not be too high or too narrow at the base for general wear . High heels throw your hips and back out of line causlong swayback and throw the feet down into the toes , ultimately resulting in those ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear ( Fig. 27 , p. 132 ) , which is fortunate as the wedge is also corrective for fallen arches . Toeing straight ahead as you walk is also helpful . Flats may cause fallen arches if worn too often . Shoes that are well-tailored , soft , and pliable are generally made on the better lasts which means better , more natural shapes , and comfortable fit ? and they are not low in price . A fine leather lining is found in the better shoes . Perforations in summer and sport shoes are decorative and increase ventilation but are unsatisfactory for bad weather . Patent leather and alligator hold heat and moisture and have little " give . " Kid shoes are very comfortable but are harder to keep in order . Suede and patent are easy to keep ordinarily . Sandals , moccasins , and play shoes should not be worn too  | much as they allow the feet to get out of shape . Welcome any style that permits adjusting the shoe over the instep and has a medium heel . Cheap shoes are usually stiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heels are America 's pets , but fashion experts frown on them for street wear ? they do not keep the feet clean and do not give good support in walking . Keep shoes in shape by walking with toes straight ahead , having heels straightened when necessary , and keeping the leather soft and clean . Keep your shoes as new looking as you can as long as you can . Gloves Fabric gloves are indispensable . They should fit as neatly as kid gloves ; have a fitting before buying . " Cadet " sizes are for short fingers . Outseam stitchings are good on sport gloves and shorties , but they make the hand appear larger ( Fig. 26 ) . Fancy trims , cuffs , cording , tucking , and pattern weaves are not in as good taste as plain pull-ons . Make certain that there are no rips , especially in the gussets . Look for durability and flexibility in fasteners or buttonholes . See that the thumb has room . Knitted fabric fits better than woven . In either case , a close , fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleazy . String gloves are serviceable for general wear but not harmonious with fine things or prints ( Fig. 26 , p. 130 ) . For sport and winter wear , capeskin , and pigskin are the good buys . For dress , suede and glace kid are excellent but expensive . You may make them yourself of fabric like jersey or velvet , or even of leather . Good leather feels soft and supple , not stiff or papery . Look for a guarantee against crocking or fading , especially in black suede . Genuine pigskin is labeled as such or carries the trade term " Peccary . " Some leathers are washable , others not , so read your labels . Chamois and doeskin are usually washable ? avoid those with thick and thin places . Handbags In buying a utility handbag for general use , it is wiser to match it with your shoes in color and , if possible , in leather . Calf , cow-  | hide , and goat skin are good buys . Pig , seal , and alligator are more expensive . Suede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , high-priced bags . Patent leather ( real or plastic ) is not generally considered appropriate for winter . A leather lining is most durable but costs more . Avoid light colors and poor stitching . A slide fastener , secret compartment , and attached well-placed coin purse add to the convenience and safety . Strap handles are good for travel but not so youthful in effect . Look for firm seams and reinforcements , ample gussets , strong frame , safe closing , and absence of a cheaper trim . Snaps make poor closings . Hand tooling limits a bag to sport wear . Shoulder-strap styles are definitely not for late day or evening . Handkerchiefs Select handkerchiefs that will wash white and are cut on the grain ( to insure their ironing straight ) . Handkerchiefs with plain narrow hems or rolled hems with initials or monograms are not cheap , especially in linen , but they are the mark of a " lady . " Plain hems for morning and general utility is the accepted rule ; monograms , neat narrow lace after eleven ; colors for afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A handkerchief should never be in evidence when handling food ? either while working in a laboratory or while at a tea . Footnote  | Footnote  | BUYING AND PREPARING PATTERNS Should I buy dresses by hip measure or bust measure ? ? the patterns are always too tight around my hips . Why does n't the pattern company indicate crosswise grain lines ? Do ready-made dress sizes correspond to pattern sizes ? Why are the front and back shoulder seams unequal in length ? Why should we be so particular as to label the pattern pieces right side up ? In making a pattern larger is n't it all right to add a seam all around the edges ? Before buying a pattern you should have made most of these decisions : 1 . The purpose , need , or use of the proposed garment . 2 . The type of fabric that fits this purpose . 3 . The color or range of colors that harmonize with your basic wardrobe and the accessories on hand . Study ready-to-wear garments and fashion magazines for recent style trends and details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? Will it " do something for you " ? Will you be able to handle it ? Select several possible patterns . Which ones are the most becoming to you ? Best suited to the fabric ? Within your dressmaking ability ? Easy to care for ? Decide on one pattern . Consider the cost of the pattern . Prices range from thirty-five cents to two dollars each . A beginner will naturally choose a simply cut design which does not cost as much 193  | as an intricately cut , high style costume pattern . It is often an economy to pay above the average price because the illustrations on the guide sheet are larger , the directions are more completely and clearly worked out , and the design details are developed in better proportions and with more originality . A beginner is placed at a disadvantage with a pattern in which directions are too few , incomplete , too small , or crowded on the guide sheet . PATTERNS FOR BEGINNERS A pattern that is easy for beginners to cut and sew has : 1 . Relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than seven . 2 . The right and left parts cut alike . 3 . Simple gored skirt rather than one with pleats or a yoke . 4 . Short or straight sleeves rather than long , fitted sleeves , where darts or a placket are needed ; or sleeveless. 5 . Simple darts and tucks rather than curved darts , slot seams , faced darts over insets , gathers entering a dart . 6 . A few larger tucks or pleats rather than many narrow ones . 7 . Pleats and tucks folded on the grain rather than on the bias . 8 . Few or no pieces cut bias or very circular ? mostly on straight of goods . 9 . Few inset details as inset belt , godets in gores , or kick pleats . 10 . A simple neckline rather than a complex notched collar or collar cut in one with the blouse front . ( A facing is a simpler neck finish than a collar. ) 11 . Lower edge of the blouse plain when attached to a gathered skirt , or gathered only when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full , an inset belt or tape is necessary to control the two separate sets of gathers . A pattern that may give trouble in fitting will be : one of incorrect size ; a skirt pleated all the way around ; a drop-shoulder yoke effect . A skirt with gathers requires little or no fitting as compared with a plain gored skirt , but six gores are easier to fit than two or four . A garment with a good many seams and darts is more easily fitted . Decorative features should also be considered . For example , facings are easier to apply than bindings , but bindings are easier than pipings or recordings . Piped buttonholes should be made right after the first fitting ; worked buttonholes may be left to the last . Bound buttonholes are easier than worked ones and piped are  | easier than bound buttonholes . Machine-made buttonholes may look better than hand-worked buttonholes , and can be left until last . PLANNING OR CHECKING THE DESIGN Simplicity of cut and decoration is the keynote to a good dress design . Decoration is most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during construction , rather than when it is applied or added as an afterthought . Self-trimming such as piped buttonholes , tucking , or pleating is the most economical method of securing beauty through decoration if you know how to sew well , but is usually expensive in ready-made clothes because of the labor problem . You can learn how to do these things . If you do n't possess this skill , make simpler clothes and buy a handsome belt or buttons , or buy richer fabrics . Cheap ready-mades are conspicuous for their overuse of cheap tawdry " trimmings , " often used to conceal poor workmanship or attract your eye away from poor fabric . There should be some element beyond monotonous plainness which is slightly unexpected , which shows imagination and a desire to interest the observer in an individual sort of way without being queer , spectacular , unharmonious , or more important than the fundamental simplicity . We call this quality " distinction " or " character . " Designers study historic costumes , not to copy these elements , but to analyze the art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many ideas in one costume . The more character evidenced in texture and color , the less necessity there is for decoration . Good sewing , pressing , and fitting are absolutely necessary to bring out the beauty of line in the design . Designing is selecting and arranging materials to secure order and beauty . If a garment is not cut , stitched , pressed , and fitted so as to be neat , fresh , cleancut in line and shape , there can be no order , hence , no beauty . Exercise care in combining the blouse of one pattern with the skirt or sleeve of another pattern . The seams of the skirt should seem to continue on with darts or seams in the blouse . Some element of similarity should exist in the parts to create harmony of shape or decoration . A full blouse requires a plainer skirt and a full skirt a less full blouse to avoid excess bulk and to create interest ( Fig. 15 , p. 80 ) . Evaluate the patterns you are considering in  | terms of harmony , proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BUY THE CORRECT PATTERN SIZE Successful dressmaking begins with a pattern of the right size ? based on actual body measurements , not age . Patterns are designed on standardized specifications ( see Revised Measurement Chart ) . Each pattern has an allowance over the basic measurements to provide ease for action , to secure design interest . Flares and curves of armholes vary both with the season and the pattern company . Practically all pattern companies base the size of their patterns on a standard scale of measurements which is printed on the pattern envelope . A more complete set of measurements is to be found in the counter book or fashion book . Misses patterns in sizes 10 , 12 and 14 are the ones most commonly used by college girls about 5 feet 6 inches tall . These sizes correspond to bust measures of 31 , 32 , and 34 inches respectively , which correspond to definite hip and waist measurements . Teen patterns are for slender figures , high bosomed , and short in waist and skirt ? about 5 feet 4 inches tall . Sub-teen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are designed for the girl in early maturity ? about 5 feet tall . For the Chubby , Half-Size and Women 's figures consult pattern books or the Revised Measurement Chart . Compare your back length with the chart to decide if one of these classes of patterns is a better choice than the Misses patterns . TAKING YOUR MEASUREMENTS Take your measurements at least once each season , since you are still growing . Take these measurements over a smooth-fitting foundation garment and dress ? never over a jacket or bulky garment . Pin a tape snug around your natural waistline ( Fig. 35 ) . Take two sets of measurements in this way : For Pattern Purchase Bust ? place a tape measure about 1 " below the armhole around the largest part of the bust in front and straight across or a  | Figure little higher in back ? with tape fairly easy , snug not tight . ( We no longer use the high chest measurement . ) Waist ? snug , around the natural waistline . Hips ? on a horizontal level , 7 " below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later Width across the back ? 4 " to 5 " below the neck , between armholes . Arm girth ? around largest part of arm about 1 " below armhole . Arm length ? from top of armhole at shoulder to the elbow and wrist at little finger with arm bent ? and under arm from armhole to wrist at thumb . Length of back ? from socket bone in neck to lower edge of tape at waist , and from bottom of tape to bottom of skirt .  | WHAT TO BUY Compare your measurements with Chart of Pattern Sizes , p. 196 . Use the bust measure to buy a blouse , dress , or coat pattern . Buy by hip measure for slacks or a separate skirt , because it is easier to alter waist than hip size . Ready-to-wear garments are not made on the same set of measurements as those used by pattern companies . You must choose your pattern on the basis of what your body measures and not according to the size you buy in a ready-made . Very often ready-mades are labeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Bureau of Standards , TS 5200A ) . KNOW YOUR PATTERN THE PATTERN GUIDE SHEET The pattern in the envelope is accompanied by a guide sheet in which the designer explains to you how the pattern is to be used for the best results . The outside of the envelope gives information of value to you at the time of purchase and usually includes : Several " views " or styles of the garment with types of fabric most suitable . A small scale illustration of all the pattern pieces . A chart of the yardage requirements based on the size , width of material , and style ( view ) selected . A list of necessary dressmaker findings such as lining , zipper , binding . The measurement for all sizes taken at bust , waist , hip , the finished length at center back , and width at lower edge . Look at the sketch of the pattern pieces to be sure that the garment is cut as you thought . Where are darts placed ? Is there a seam at the waistline under the belt ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yoke ? Is the collar applied with a shaped facing ? The guide sheet usually contains on one side : Clear-cut views of the design . An explanation of symbols , e.g. , which are grain lines , which edges go on a fold .  | A diagram of the pattern pieces , numbered to indicate the parts , with directions as to where to locate the grain line , where to make necessary piecings , how many copies to be cut of each piece , where folds , darts , or hems occur , alteration lines . Sometimes numbers are used to indicate matching notches , letters to indicate parts and sometimes the order of joining . Numerous layouts to correspond to certain widths of material , sizes , napped fabrics , and views . On the other side are given dressmaking instructions such as seam finishing , and specific step-by-step methods to use in putting this garment together . Most important is the statement of the amount of seam allowance provided . Some patterns have an extra wide allowance on the silhouette seams to allow for letting out during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with commercial patterns , the more you will learn about dressmaking . As a beginner , you should learn to interpret and follow these printed directions . In addition , you and your instructor can work out other good methods or modify the ones given based on such underlying principles as found in the succeeding chapters of this book . RECOGNIZING THE PARTS OF A PATTERN Early in your dressmaking career it is ' important to recognize at a glance where each pattern piece belongs in the finished garment or on the wearer . A child is apt to get a neckline confused with an armhole and you think it is very amusing . At your age you would n't make such an error . But do you know the differences between the front and back of a blouse as to length of shoulder seam , shape of neck , armhole , and width at waistline ? If not , study Fig. 283 , p. 567 . You must learn to distinguish the front from the back of the sleeve in order to make a pair of sleeves and to place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Unusual cuts may not be identified at first glance but a study of the pattern guide sheet and a comparison with the sketch on the pattern envelope enables one to know where they belong in the dress . Usually it is necessary to study the notches to find out how the parts are joined .  | WHY ONLY HALF A PATTERN ? Obviously it costs less to produce and distribute half a pattern folded flat in an envelope instead of the bulky whole pattern . Furthermore , it saves time to work with a half blouse in pinning the parts together for a trial fitting . You are less likely to tear the pattern in handling half of a paper dress . Less table space is required if the fabric can be folded together , and less time is required if two pieces can be cut at once . But the most important reason is that the right and left halves are more exactly alike if cut at the same time , and the resulting garment is more likely to be balanced . Of course to achieve balance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right and left sides are not alike , a whole right side and a whole left side of the pattern must be furnished . In small pieces like yokes , inset belts , and collars , a whole part instead of a half a part is sometimes provided . Be very careful to have the grain straight on the table and to make opposite sides of the pattern match the grain line , or fold on the grain line and use only one half of the pattern when cutting these pieces . By consulting the directions find out which pieces represent a whole pattern of which only one needs to be cut in cloth ; which pieces require two ( mates ) ? a pair , not duplicates ; which pieces represent a half , to be placed on a fold . ( Study Fig. 37 . ) PATTERN PREPARATION The most important steps in preparing a pattern include : 1 . Drawing in and extending the lengthwise grain lines in all pieces and the crosswise grain line in the sleeve ( also , sometimes in slacks ) . 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fold .  | Figure 3 . Locating centers , openings and fold lines of hems of pleats . 4 . Knowing the use of every perforation or marking . 5 . Altering the pattern after pinning it together and trying it on . Compare the shapes of the pieces with the illustrations on the guide sheet and label each so it will fit right side out on the right half of the body . Return to the envelope all pieces not to be used for this garment . There are two general classes of perforations or printed indications ? the " placing markings " and the " construction markings . " The placing markings enable one to place the pattern on the material to produce the effect planned by the designer . The construction markings tell one how to put the parts together after they are cut out . All the construction markings must be transferred in some way to aid in construction , but only a few placing markings will be transferred to the cloth after cutting out to aid in fitting . The lengthwise grain line is necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in placing it on the cloth so that it will set properly on the body . Find the perforations which indi-  | cate the grain line ( Fig. 38 ) . With a yardstick ( not a short ruler ) draw a line through these perforations and extend this grain line the entire length of the pattern . This line may coincide with markBut as such creases may be ings for the CF ( center front ) or CB ( center back ) . If so , label appropriately . Obviously edges to be placed on a lengthwise fold of the cloth require no line ( Fig. 39 ) . If you do not have a yard-stick , it is possible to fold the pattern from perforation to perforation , extending the fold to both ends of the pattern . confused with other creases and grain line in the pattern , draw a pencil line on the crease at once and label it . In a sleeve pattern , it is more accurate first to draw in the crosswise grain line at the base of the sleeve cap ? from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this line over on itself from end to end . The resulting crease is the lengthwise grain line and the middle of the sleeve . Draw in the corrected lengthwise grain line so that it is extended the entire length of the sleeve . ( Sometimes the perforations are slightly misplaced , but this method insures accuracy . ) In small , irregular , and narrow pieces do not confuse fold perforations with seam or grain line perforations . In such cases draw in two or three other lengthwise grain lines ? parallel to the first one . Check to see that the grain line markings or facings parallel those on the piece to be faced ( Fig. 41 ) . WHERE IS THE SEAM LINE ? The seam line is the sewing line ? " to 5/s " back from the cut edge of the pattern or cloth . In pinning the pattern together , lap one piece over the other so that seam lines coincide . ( Beginners sometimes bring the cutting edge of one piece over to the seam  | line of another which inaccurately makes the garment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seam lines " or " pin seam line on seam line . " Know the seam allowance in your pattern . Each pattern company uses a different width of seam and has a different way of showing it . Some companies use perforations , others use printed lines , and some use no marking at all but simply state the amount allowed . Notice the custom of some companies of using wider seams on the silhouette for purposes of fitting than are used elsewhere in the garment . Cut a cardboard gauge ( Fig. 72 , p. 250 ) of the width of seam allowed and another for the wider let-out seams . Use these gauges to check the width of seams when pinning , basting , and stitching . Use such a gauge in setting and adjusting the machine gauge when you plan to baste by machine or to stitch the seam permanently . The more intricate the cut of the pattern , the more important it is to check the seam allowance ? especially on curves and corners .  | TESTING PATTERNS BY MEASUREMENTS Compare your body measurements or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texture with measurements at corresponding places on the pattern . In measuring the pattern , measure from seam line to seam line or to center fold ? not to or from the cutting edges . In adjusting a pattern to body measurements , compare your measurements with the chart on pp. 196-198 and allow for the amounts of ease given on p. 343 . Shoulderlength measures are not as valuable as the width across the back because of possible variation in the style of neckline and because it is difficult to locate the ends of the shoulder seam on a sloping neck or a rounded arm . The underarm seam is difficult to measure , too , because the new pattern may have the armhole set differently than that in the dress you are wearing or measuring . The best method is to pin the pattern together and try it on ( Fig. 42 ) . TESTING PATTERNS BY A TRIAL FITTING 1 . Pin the pattern together as if you were basting it ( or by lapping one piece over another ) seam line on seam line , matching notches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pins parallel with and on the seam line . 2 . Pin in pleats , darts , and hems according to perforations or marked lines . Instead of gathers , fold in soft wide pleats . Omit pockets , collars , ties , facings. 3 . Pin the parts together step by step as suggested in the pattern guide sheet , beginning with smaller sections , until you have a front blouse and a back blouse ; then the shoulder and underarm seams to make a half'hlouse . Do not pin too close to the armhole at the underarm seam for it is easily torn apart . 4 . Pin sleeve darts and seams . Wait to pin the sleeve in the armhole during fitting . 5 . Pin sections of skirt together to make a half skirt front , then  | a half skirt back ; then pin the front to the back on a side-hip seam to make a half skirt . 6 . Pin blouse and skirt together at the waistline ( to a belt , if inset ) . The result will be half of a garment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half only . If part of the garment is asymmetrical in design , that part only will be cut as a whole piece and the remainder a half . 7 . Pin up lower hem lines . 8 . Arrange for assistance in fitting and making decisions . 9 . Try on the paper pattern over foundation garments , slip ( and shoulder pad , if any ) . Try on jacket and coat patterns over dress or blouse . Pin the waistline of the pattern to a tape around your normal waistline . Anchor center front and center back to your slip and the shoulder seam to your slip strap ( Fig. 42 ) . 10 . Before the mirror examine the pattern as to : Proportions , style features , and becomingness . Length above and below waist line , sleeves . Ease in width ? no riding-up . Balance ? no bulging away at neck , armhole , or lower edges . " Set " and direction of seam lines . Note the kind and amounts of change needed . Pin darts and tucks to fit on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 . Carefully remove the pattern , alter it accurately , and try it on again . Repeat until the pattern seems satisfactory ( Figures 43 , 44 , 45 and 46 ) . WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN TRYING ON THE PATTERN 1 . Does the garment reach from center front to center back with ease without displacement ? Does the blouse or skirt ride up ? Decide where it is too tight , how much to let out and where . Decide where it is too loose , how much to take up and where . Decide on changes for length ( Fig. 43 ) . 2 . Is the shoulder seam the correct length for the present mode ? If it is too long and the blouse is also too full or too wide at bust and back , take a lengthwise tuck from shoulder to waist on both front and  | back until it fits correctly  --  but not tight ( see p. 343 , for amount of ease to leave ) . If the shoulder seam is too short , decide whether to widen the blouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 44 ) and determine amount to widen the shoulder . 3 . If the pattern rests on the shoulder at the neck but not at the armscye , the person has sloping shoulders or needs a shoulder pad . Estimate the amount and the best way to remedy the fault . Will a thicker shoulder pad correct it with pleasing effect ? 4 . If the pattern bulges away from the shoulder at the neck but rests snugly at the armscye , the person has square shoulders . Estimate amount and best place to remedy . Is there room for a shoulder pad ? 5 . If the blouse pattern is too long in the center back but correct in length at front and side seams , see if the person has a sway-back . Fold a dart from CB to armhole to take out the needed amount ( Fig. 44 , I ) . Be sure the fault is not a prominent bust . 6 . If the blouse pattern is too short in the center back but correct in length at front and side seam , correct for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make a cross where the greatest bulge occurs ( Fig. 44 , J ) . 7 . If the blouse pattern is too short in front but not at sides or back , see if the bust is prominent . If the armhole bulges and the underarm seam is too far forward , the front half needs more ease . Locate the fullest part of the bust with a cross and measure the extra length required . Decide how much to add in width . See if a shoulder dart can be added or widened . Does the back need extra width too ? If the underarm seam should be taken up or let out , make sleeve seams match . 8 . If a skirt pattern dips in center back , or swings toward side hip , see if the wearer has a sway-back . Take a horizontal dart from CB tapering off at hip or waistline till CB hangs straight ; just opposite from prominent back . 9 . If the side seam swings to the front , correct for large abdomen ( Fig. 45 , D ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Fig. 45 , E ) . 10 . Are waistline and neckline in the most becoming location ? 11 . Are closings correctly arranged and adequate ?  | 12 . Pull the sleeve up gently on the right arm until armholes match underneath ? pin there if possible , at top of shoulders , and at notches . Does width at largest girth of the upper arm provide at least two inches of ease ? Estimate the amount to add . If amount of ease is too great , pin two narrow tucks full length in the sleeve pattern . Does the grain line divide the ease so that it balances from front to back ? Bend the arm ? does the elbow dart fall on the elbow ? If not , estimate the amount of change needed above and below dart . Pin in tucks to shorten ( Fig. 46 ) . Measure for extra length if needed . 13 . Check or change length of belt , wrist , or neckbands. 14 . Study length of blouse , skirt , sleeve , jacket , and peplum separately and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient ? 15 . Remove the pattern and alter it , following Figures 43 , 44 , 45 and 46 . GENERAL PRINCIPLES FOR ALTERING PATTERNS 1 . In order to retain the designer 's good lines , keep the structural silhouette or design seams unchanged in outline and direction . To do so , make most changes within the area or center of the pattern by slashing and spreading , or tucking ( slashing and lapping ) ? not by adding along edges . 2 . Keep the grain line , or the edge to be placed on a fold , straight , in order to preserve balance in the completed pattern . To do so , make slashes or tucks parallel or at right angles to the grain line as needed . 3 . Make changes in size ( length or width ) between points of articulation ? that is , between joints where the body moves ? in order to preserve lines and to create change exactly where effective . 4 . Avoid making changes that cover up perforations or disturb the location of darts and decorations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slashes come through darts for control of fit . 5 . When changing darts and gore seams to fit the waistline do not change more than ' /4 " at any one place ; it is better to alter darts than the hip seam to avoid a bias on the hip which may stretch out of shape . 6 . Proportions are better preserved by making small changes in several places , as in gores , rather than taking the whole amount in one place . Slight changes may be made by changing the silhouette seam allowance during stitching . 7 . If an alteration lengthens or shortens an edge , alter the corresponding edge it joins to match . Alter the length of a front the same as a back ; a facing to match the part it faces , collar to match neck sleeves to match armholes. 8 . Draw transitional lines to correct lines broken in making tucks or slashes across slanting or curved edges . 9 . A pattern with straight , not slanting , sides may be changed at the lower edge . A pattern with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widened or narrowed if altered at the lower edge , a factor which you  | will have to decide is either desirable or undesirable . If the lower edge is irregular in shape , you will get safer and quicker results by changing in the area above ( principle 1 above ) . 10 . Where one side of a pattern piece is to be altered more than the other side as for a full bust , it is necessary to slash completely over to the opposite side ( in order to make the pattern lie flat ) . Do not slash through the opposite side unless it , too , needs some change . 11 . Make right-angled slashes where it is necessary to alter in one part without affecting other parts , such as broadening or narrowing shoulders , waistlines , and hip lines . Spread at areas needing the extra ease . Overlap at areas needing surplus fullness removed . Make new darts in a " spread " if it comes out too wide . 12 . Altering for bulge difficulties such as a prominent bust and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sway-back , requires two slashes , one lengthwise and one crosswise , intersecting at the point of bulge with one slash through the fundamental dart controlling the fullness over the bulge ( Fig. 44 ) . We aim to provide length and width to cover the bulge and we aim to widen the dart so that the extra fullness can be taken up to make it fit the adjoining seam . For hollows , lap the slashes and narrow the dart . If the new dart is too wide for neatness , convert.to two narrow ones ( Fig. 47 ) . 13 . The amount of change to make is determined best by fitting the pattern on the figure . After making alterations , try it on again or check measurements with a satisfactory garment . 14 . Patterns may be altered to change the style or design ( Chap . 24 ) . This kind of change involves such problems as changing the gathers or flare in a skirt , the roll in a collar , the location of darts , the addition or elimination of a yoke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the design more becoming to you or save material when cutting . Your teacher will be glad to help where necessary . However , beginners should select suitable designs in the first place , because the teacher can not take time to help a large number of students with such problems until they have mastered other basic skills . Applications of these basic principles are shown in Figures 43 , 44 , 45 and 46 . PRACTICAL HELPS 1 . It is easier and less destructive of your tissue pattern to pin in tucks rather than to slash and spread . Therefore buy patterns a little too large rather than too small if you can not buy your exact size . Supplement pins with masking or cellophane tape . 2 . Do not try to change a size 14 to size 16 or vice versa . This is pattern grading ? and is better left to more experienced workers . Buy the correct size in the beginning . ? See Mabel D. Erwin , Practical Dress Design ( New York : The Macmillan Company , 1954 ) , page 4. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , shortens a pattern two inches ; a slash lapped one inch removes only one inch . 4 . Tucks are not as accurate in heavy paper as lapping slashed edges . If you dislike slashing your pattern because you want to keep it for other uses , cut a duplicate on which to make your alterations . 5 . Draw grain lines on a fresh piece of paper and lay the pattern down on it before slashing and spreading to avoid misplacing or confusing parts . Pin the parts in their proper relationship at once before working the next piece . To avoid confusion , draw matching notches on each line before slashing so that the pattern can be put back together again easily and accurately . 6 . A gauge is more accurate and convenient for measuring than a tape or yardstick . Use a gauge to alter hem . 7 . Pin a piece of paper under just the part you need to change such as the shape of the neck or the underarm curve . Pin or tape securely . 8 . Seam lines formed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better plan is to cut around all edges of the pattern except the one to be changed ; unpin the pattern and slip it over as far as desired ; pin carefully on the straight again and cut to follow the rest of the pattern exactly ( Fig. 72 , p. 250 ) . 9 . To change a wide dart to two narrower ones ( Fig. 47 ) : A , make Figure a paper copy of the dart ; B , fold into two ( or three ) long triangles and cut apart . C , paste a fresh piece of paper to widen the seam an inch or so . Place the new narrower darts in position desired ; trace around them . D , fold in the new darts to make the pattern cup , and tape in place ; then cut a smooth seam line across them before unfolding . E , when open the new seam line jogs differently . EXERCISES 1 .

Let all girls in the class alter a skirt front ( or back ) for a fourgored skirt with no darts for a girl whose hips are three inches larger  | than the pattern size ( waist and bust are correct ) .

On half-size patterns let each girl alter a pattern for round shoulders or full bust whichever interests her most ( for her own problem or someone in her family ) . 4 . Explain Figures 37 and 39.  | How do you decide which is the right side of a fabric ? Should you pull a thread to straighten the end of checked gingham ? If the cut end of the cloth is parallel with the end of the table , is n't it straight enough to place the patterns on and cut ? Is if possible to have the lengthwise perforations on the lengthwise grain , yet have the crosswise grain not straight ? Why does dampening help to straighten cloth ? What fabrics require a layout designed for cloth " with a nap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can I identify the warp ? GRAIN Threads or yarns , the units that make cloth and create texture , are called " the grain . " This same term is applied to wood in which cells of similar shape are arranged in the same direction . In talking about cloth we should be careful to say crosswise grain or lengthwise grain , although some dressmakers assume that lengthwise grain is meant when speaking casually about the grain . Grain means the direction of the threads . Hence , there is no such thing as a bias grain . The lengthwise or warp threads are usually heavier or stronger ( because they were put in the loom first and had to take a vigorous beating in the process of weaving ) . They run parallel with the selvage , the finished edge which runs lengthwise of the fabric . Since the selvage is made of several extra warp threads , thicker than the body of the fabric , and the filling is wound around  | the outer warp thread , selvage is likely to shrink more than the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut it entirely away . The crosswise or filling threads are woven over and under the warp threads ( to fill in ) ? back and forth from selvage to selvage . They are usually softer , less twisted yarns . The warp threads , being heavier , tend to hang straighter . They will wear better . Except in unusual designs , the lengthwise of the cloth should hang straight down on the figure ? from the neck to the waist , from the armhole to the elbow , from the waistline to the bottom of the skirt . Ruffles , pleats , plackets , and gathers tend to bulge in ungraceful lines if the folds follow filling threads , but fall in straight flat lines or graceful folds if the folds follow lengthwise threads . A scarf cut across the cloth does not drape as gracefully as one cut lengthwise . Fabrics with heavy crosswise threads or ribs " hang " or " set " better if the crosswise of the fabric is cut to hang lengthwise on the body . Designers all agree on these general rules , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The figure itself is neither straight nor flat . Hence , designers use darts and cut curves and angles in the cloth to fit the body or to create interesting designs . Hence , it is obvious that the lengthwise threads can not all be straight up and down on the figure . The designer has to decide where the lengthwise grain will be placed in each part of the pattern . In each pattern piece this information is provided by a line of perforations so that you can tell exactly where to place it on the cloth . The part of the garment cut on the lengthwise grain will hang straight to the floor , the part cut on slanting or bias lines will flare or ripple , the more it will flare ( Fig. 48 ) . Though you can not see the warp easily in some fabrics , it is strong and mighty . We often say , " it has a will of its own , " " let the fabric hang the way it wants to . " In this respect it is like the bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , you can feel them and you know they are there , the supporting structure that indicates the working force . Hence , if we want the dress design balanced on the figure , we must cut the right half to match the left , not only in shape , but in grain . Experienced sewers and fitters can see grain at once , but beginners are usually " grain conscious " only when the grain  | is very conspicuous . With experience , you will see that grain has a definite relationship to fitting , that you are uncomfortable with a sleeve off grain because it draws or twists on the arm . You may have tried to iron a belt , handkerchief , or towel cut " off grain " and found it impossible to iron it straight . Cheap handkerchiefs have crooked hems and never fold into true quarters because the edges were not cut along a thread . Cheap ready-made clothes are often cut off grain , but one expects to find higher class merchandise cut with regard to grain . Grain is important in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garment . Be as particular in straightening the grain and Figure  | placing it on the table straight for belts , cuffs , and facings as you are for gores and sleeves ? draw new threads sometimes , or repress before cutting . PREPARING THE FABRIC FOR CUTTING STRAIGHTENING THE ENDS It is necessary to have the ends of the fabric straight before placing the pattern . If the store has torn the cloth , you will see one filling thread ravelling all the way across the end . If it has been cut , pick up the filling thread that appears to go all the way across and pull it gently as far as you can like a gathering thread . Do not try to pick it out with a pin or pull it all the way across , but cut with the scissors as far as you can see the fine crinkly line it has made ( Fig. 49 ) . Then stop , pick up another ravelling , pull it as far as it will pull and cut again . Continue pulling and cutting across the piece . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material is firm , you may tear across one end to straighten it . Clip through the selvage at one side for about one inch . Place one thumb on top and the other underneath . Give a firm , rather quick jerk to tear quickly straight across . If the cloth appears to shred or draw or split , stop tearing and pull a thread the rest of the way . It is better to ask the clerk when buying fabric either to tear it or to pull a thread or to make allowance for the waste . Fold the material lengthwise , right sides in , selvage on selvage . Place not only the sides but also the ends parallel with the edges of the table . RESTORING THE RIGHT-ANGLED STRUCTURE All cloth is woven straight , but frequently in finishing at the factory it is fed crookedly through rollers or folded unevenly on  | the bolt board . The filling ( crosswise ) threads become pulled so they are no longer exactly at right angles to the warp ( lengthwise ) threads . If they have been pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite direction ( Fig. 50 ) . Be sure that you are stretching in the right direction . To test , have the cloth laid out so that the selvages parallel the side of the table ( Fig. 51 , A ) . If the previously ravelled ends of the fabric do not parallel the end of the table , the crosswise threads obviously are not at right angles to the lengthwise . The stretching should be toward the short corners ( Figures 50 and 51 ) . if you pull in Figure the wrong direction , you will make it worse . If you pull too far , reverse the direction of pulling . Test frequently by placing on the table . If the material is stubborn , clip the selvage at intervals or remove it ; or slightly dampen the fabric by leaving it rolled in a damp towel for awhile or steam press it double or single wrong side out ; or wet thoroughly , pin to a cutting board , to partially dry , then press . Or if it is cotton , give it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrinking . Finally , wrong side out , pin selvages together and the torn or trimmed ends together and smooth out flat and straight with the sides and ends of the table . Usually the cheaper fabrics cause the most trouble . Learn to observe the torn end of the cloth when shopping . Most blends and many synthetics offer no difficulty . Cottons with heavy creaseresistant finishes are heat-set , as are nylons and many blends of man-made fibers ; there is no use in wetting or stretching them . Importance of Crosswise Grain Pattern makers do not stress the importance of crosswise grain sufficiently in their directions to the ( pattern ) consumer . It is en-  | tirely possible-to have the lengthwise perforations of the pattern on the lengthwise grain of the cloth , yet have the crosswise grain off , if it is not on the table straight and if the upper and under layers do not match as to grain . If the pattern had the crosswise grain marked as well as the lengthwise , the pattern user would respect crosswise grain as well as lengthwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacket or skirt does not match the left both as to design and as to grain , both design and fit will be out of balance ( Figures 52 and 53 ) . In solid fabrics you may think the grain will not show , but the seemingly invisible grain suddenly appears striking ; soon you note a diagonal wrinkle and are un-  | happy . By this time you are grain conscious . When you become grain conscious and know how to control grain to make it do what you want , you have learned one of the most important " secrets of good dressmaking . " Having the ends straight means having filling threads at right angles to the warp . To preserve balance in the finished product , you must have both layers straight at ends and sides and straight Figure with the edges of the table all during cutting . You must also have a crosswise grain line drawn on such pieces as sleeves , yokes , and collars and the lengthwise grain line extended full length on each piece . Then you are ready to place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cloth . Identifying Lengthwise Grain To distinguish the lengthwise grain in a piece of cloth without a selvage , grasp the straight of the goods between the thumb and fingers of both hands and stretch firmly . The warp will have little or no " give , " but the filling will stretch a slight amount . By holding the fabric to the light , generally you can see the threads . On many materials , you can see the difference with the naked eye , as the warp threads are usually larger or heavier . If you examine ravelled threads , the warp threads are usually more tightly twisted and filling softer , more loosely twisted , and easily ravelled.  | A lengthwise stripe woven in the fabric is lengthwise grain . A line or fold obtained by measuring with a gauge or tape equal distances from the selvage is a lengthwise grain line . A crosswise stripe in a woven plaid is crosswise grain . A line measured equal distances from the torn end of solid-colored cloth will be parallel with it and hence on a crosswise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woven do not often coincide with the grain ( Fig. 54 ) . If such fabric must be used , the rule is to sacrifice grain if the printed design is very large or prominent , but observe the grain in smaller designs . Disregard of grain is most serious in garments to be laundered and wherever fit or style is important to the wearer . Making Extra Grain Lines for Guides Do n't trust the original center crease in material as a guide for locating lengthwise grain lines . On twills , heavily napped woolens , printed crepes , jersey , and lacy weaves , it is often confusing and time consuming to locate the exact lengthwise or crosswise grains . Much time and trouble is saved by marking with chalk or basting on the wrong side , extra lines , parallel with the selvage and lines parallel with the torn ends , twelve to eighteen inches apart . Then in intricate layouts , patterns may be correctly placed even when there is no selvage to follow . NAP OR PILE ? " Nap " refers to the fuzz created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yarns . Outing flannel and woolen coatings , for example , have napped finishes . " Pile " refers to a special weave in which cut ends of extra thread stand upright on the surface , in velvet and corduroy , for instance . Both nap and pile are sheared and brushed evenly , usually in one direction . For the sake of brevity , the term nap is used to indicate any fabric with a distinct up and down , whether it is nap , pile , or a design that must be used upright . Flat pile like panne velvet and wool broadcloth should have the nap running downward , but raised
