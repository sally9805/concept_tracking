Britt , Iowa , hung its bunting out again last week ; the hoboes were coming to town . They cannonballed from east &; west , bedded down in the town park , the jungle under the railroad water tank , in freight cars . Scholarly Roger Payne , 72 , and plump Polly Pep were exceptions . Payne slept in the school doorway ; Polly , the only woman delegate to the bindle stiffs ' first postwar convention , picked a haystack . <P> In a business sense , there was little doing at the high powwow . The hoboes were glad to be back in Britt ( pop. : 2,000 ) , where they had met off &; on since 1900 . The " big spuds " ( city officials ) welcomed them because they lured some 10,000 curious North Iowa visitors to town . In gratitude , the boes ladled enough Mulligan stew from billycans to feed the crowd . They chewed the guff about life on the road and the state of the union . All agreed that times were tough . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron will to remain a hobo . <P> When the time came to elect a king , the boes looked to their professional ethics . A hobo can not be a tramp or a bum . He must not beg or steal or ignore soap &; water . Now &; then he must work a while . His peers elected Bo Sigurd ( " Skeets " ) Simmons , 56 , of Detroit , who hitchhiked from New York in seven days , spent $10 for food en route . Ben ( " The Coast Kid " ) Benson , twotime king of the jungles , ran a poor fifth . There were strong hints that Ben was a " greaseball " and never took a bath . Said one hobo : " He 's just a bum .
