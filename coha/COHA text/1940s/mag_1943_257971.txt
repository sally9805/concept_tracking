How many jobs must a free U.S. industry provide in the postwar world if it is to save itself ? <P> Studebaker 's able , handsome President Paul G. Hoffman , who is also chairman of industry 's Committee for Economic Development , tried valiantly to answer this question at the National Industrial Conference Board session in New York . <P> Said he : Industry will have to supply " something like 58,000,000 " full-time jobs , a jolting 12,000,000 more than in the " good " year of 1940 . That means a U.S. output of goods and services of some $145,000,000,000 . <P> But industry must be ready to perform fantastic tasks . Warned Automan Hoffman : " The very toughness of the assignment makes clear the necessity of starting to plan now . When the fighting is over , ex-soldiers on street corners selling apples . . . people starving in one part of the country while food surpluses rot in another would be death rattles for private business . . . . " <P> As a start for any planning , Hoffman listed : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk-taking ( those who risk create the jobs ) ; 2 ) restoration of competition to the " fullest possible extent " ; 3 ) a solution for the special problems of small businesses which have found it " too tough to be born , even tougher to stay alive " ; 4 ) recognition that " those who persist in thinking as isolationists are headed down a blind alley . "
