txt Of Laughter YOUR reviewer , commenting on the preponderance of laughter - provoking plays just at this time when we are on the brink of war , voices his approval of such as the blessed privilege of a free people to enjoy themselves in a fascist - ridden world . And yet I can not help but feel that a few more plays dealing with the tragic complications confronting us would be more in keeping with the temper of the times . Evidently we are embarking upon an era somewhat similar to that of ancient Greece during the Peloponnesian wars . It was the age of Aristophanes and Euripides . The sometimes ribald comedies of the former , however , were full of social and political implications , while the tragedies of the latter were uncompromisingly relentless . The Athenians knew they were in a mortal struggle with the Nazilike Spartans and there were no writers to flatter them or lull them into a false sense of security . Americans have yet to demonstrate that they can stomach a theatre bristling with the horrors of world-wide tragedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
