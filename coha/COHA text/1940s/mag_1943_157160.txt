Two top-flight U.S. businessmen last week clashed head on in Washington in a struggle for power that is less indicative of their ambitions than it is of one bitter truth : after over a year of war , the Government 's top industrial command is still disorganized . <P> One protagonist in Washington 's latest fracas is tough , shrewd Ferdinand Eberstadt , artillery captain in World War I , outstanding independent investment banker of the ' 305 , and currently charged with WPB 's vital materials division . The other is Charles E. Wilson , whom Donald Nelson brought to Washington to take charge of WPB 's production division . <P> In any U.S. business enterprise , materials control and production should be Siamese twins . Not so in Washington . Week ago Donald Nelson touched off the row when he turned over to Wilson ( on Wilson 's threat of resignation ) certain all-important " industry divisions " which Ferd Eberstadt has labored long and hard to build up . Function of these divisions is to see to it that , after raw materials have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they flow smoothly to prime contractors and vital component parts manufacturers . They are the vital agencies on which WPB 's control of raw materials depends . <P> Background of Confusion . Such control was the essence of the power of the old War Industries Board of World War I , which the Army hoped the President would duplicate back in 1940 . Instead came a dreary series of compromises ( the Defense Commission , OPM , SPAB ) , culminating in WPB itself . By that time the Army and Navy of necessity had acquired vast powers , not only over the ordering of war products ( which has always been their function ) , but over the flow and scheduling of raw materials as well . <P> Last summer , however , a reasonable compromise seemed to have been hit when Ferd Eberstadt , who had served the Army and Navy well as chairman of their Joint Munitions Board , was switched over to WPB . Promptly he set up his Controlled Materials Plan ( TIME , Nov. 9 ) and attempted to give his authority over raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent . To top off the new program Nelson , with Eberstadt 's approval , called in Charlie Wilson , who should have become an expediter of particularly serious production bottlenecks . <P> Instead , Wilson was given the title of chief of production-a high-sounding assignment which technically made him responsible for just about the whole U.S. war economy . At the same time many an ardent New Dealer either within the WPB or without it , who has little love for Ferd Eberstadt 's tough realism , urged Nelson into checking Eberstadt 's growing power . Finally came the current explosion , partly inevitable , partly the result of clashing authorities over which no one could or would assume a firm control . The explosives : the shortage of vital component parts needed in the Navy 's escort program , the Army 's high-octane gasoline program , and Bill Jeffers ' rubber program .
