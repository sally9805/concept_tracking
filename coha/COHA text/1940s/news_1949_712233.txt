txt The $5,647,724,000 foreign aid bill was sent back to the Senate floor tonight after Appropriations Committee reconsideration of amendments which led to its shelving last week after four days of debate . There was time before the night 's recess , however , only to square off for a new fight over the measure . Passed in the evening sitting too late to permit attention to further business was a $7,600,000,000 bill to provide funds for independent ag-encies . Five full days of trenchto-trench battle over this bill preceded the action , which was by a voice vote . Despite this progress Congress , still faced a log jam of appropriations measures such as could not be recalled by Congressional veterans . Under a second extension of temporary appropriation power it had only eleven working days ( if Saturdays are included ) to complete action on five bills carrying nearly $20,000,000,000 of appropriations . Most of these bills are highly controversial . One , covering the Army 's civil functions program , has been deadlocked since June 1 in attempts to adjust Senate and House differences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $12,731,834,478 supply bill for the National Military Establishment , the $590,685 , - ' 911 Interior Department bill and $127,042,243 third deficiency bill , to which , it was indicated , much would be added . These , of course , are in addition to the foreign aid bill , designed to finance through the present fiscal year the Marshall Plan , the GreekTurkish program and the costs of Army occupation in Germany , Austria , Japan and the Ryukyu Islands . Senate leaders were particularly anxious to take up the foreign aid measure ' again at the earliest moment . As the session opened at noon to resume debate on the agencies measure Senator Scott W. Lucas , the majority leader , pleaded : " I find that we have been almost five days on this one bill . While I do nottunderestimate the importance of this measure  --  all appropriation bills are - important ? Senators are constantly asking me , ' When are we going home ? When are we going to adjourn ? ' Cites " Slap-Happy " View " We are now about five weeks behind on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall be another two weeks on appropriation bills . Certainly we must get the appropriation bills out of the way before we can seriously discuss the question of an early adjournment . " He noted that one Senator had said recently that the Senate was " slap-happy " and " punch-drunk " and was due for " a seventh-inning stretch . " The discussion by this Senator , he noted , included the suggestion of time out until fall . Much of today 's debate on the independent agencies measure-centered on a proposal by Senator Joseph C. O'Mahoney , Democrat , of Wyoming , in charge of the bill , to block the awarding of Atomic Energy Commission fellowships to students belonging to or agreeing with organizations which sought to overthrow the United States Government . This proposal developed directly from disclosures in May that one of the students to whom such an award was made was an avowed Communist and another was said to have shown previous interest in Communist gatherings . Senator Bourke B. Hickenlooper , Republican , of Iowa , former chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellowships required investigation . The amendment was adopted by a voice vote . A ' no " was heard from Senator Glen H. Taylor of Idaho , Progressive party nominee for Vice President in 1948 . There was , however , expression of Cat= cern by Senator Wayne Morse , Republican , of Oregon , and Senator Claude Pepper , Democrat , of Florida , that the administration of the amendment might develop into ' " a spy hunt . " Senator O'Mahoney gave assurance that the proposed Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiries would apply only to those recommended for fellowships and that the FBI 's findings would be subject to decision only by the Atomic Energy Commission . The program involves about 500 fellowships . More than $5,000,000,000 of the money in the independent offices bill was earmarked for the Veterans Administration , for pensions , allowances and benefits . Senator Pepper , in the last hour of debate , demanded that another $48,000,000 go for hospitals and medical care of veterans . He received an apparent promise that this would be considered when the Ithird deficiency bill came along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
