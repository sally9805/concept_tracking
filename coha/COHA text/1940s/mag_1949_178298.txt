When Richard Buckminster Fuller 's name is mentioned , most architects chuckle indulgently ; a few reverently bow their heads . Sparkling " Bucky " Fuller , a rotund little man who looks more businesslike than he is , long ago startled the U.S. with designs for three-wheeled , tear-shaped cars and pear-shaped " Dymaxion " houses hung from metal masts , but he never succeeded in convincing investors that his ideas were adaptable to mass production - the only kind that interests him . At 54 , Bucky confesses without a smile that his one purpose is still to house " the 800 million people now alive who will at one time or another die of exposure . " <P> To do it , Bucky three years ago incorporated himself as the nonprofit ( and taxexempt ) Fuller Research Foundation . Businessmen may sneer at Bucky , but artists are more sympathetic . Last week 91 Chicago artists ( most of them young abstractionists ) contributed their paintings , sculptures and photographs to a Chicago art auction that raised $700 for Bucky , Inc . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the borderline areas of technology . . . that industry can not undertake . Bucky believes his researches into the structure of such things as crystals , stars and atoms will result in brand-new principles of building construction . Present-day houses weigh about 22 Ibs. per cubic ft. ; Bucky has plans for a new house he calls " Geodesic " which he hopes will weigh only 1 Ib. per 50 cubic ft . If this one turns out to be practical , no one will ever again chuckle at Bucky 's dreams .
