txt An eruption of Mauna Loa , which spewed fountains of flaming lava hundreds of feet into the air for two weeks and at one time threatened Hilo and its important harbor , has now subsided . The Army considers the information no longer of value to the enemy and today allowed newspaper men to tell the story for the first time . Rivers of molten rock , which gushed from the mountainside at three points , came within eight miles of Hilo , a city of 20,000 on the Island of Hawaii , 200 miles from Honolulu , which is on Oahu . Twice the Army bombed the flow to divert its course when it seemed about to do serious damage . Now the restless mountain is at peace again after having laid a ear1 pet of lava over some unimportant range land and having pushed aside a forest . Outbreak Near Summit The first outbreak occurred about 5 P. M. on Sunday , April 26 , near the great dome-shaped summit , which towers 13,680 feet above the sea . Th , e volcanic eruption usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the islands to see the show . This time , although the news was soon common knowledge , the Army banned publication until activity on the mountain ceased and the great jets of fire no longer provided a beacon in the night for possible Japanese raiders . Although smoke lingered for two more days , after Sunday , May 10 , there were no more dazzling fountains against the sky and no more strings of fiery lava looking like huge red snakes corning down the dark mountainside . Today , presumably , it will be no help to the Japanese to know that this all happened . The eruption began at two // MAUNA LOA ERUPTS ; HAWAII PORT SAVED // places : In the main summit crater of Mokuaweoweo , where observers from the air saw tremendous avalanches rolling down the inner sides of the pit the next day , and at a point about 12,000 feet up on the northeast ridge , where the first big lava flow poured from the earth . The avalanches indicated to veteran observers that the pressure beneath the earth within the pit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lava was seeking another outlet at a lower level . That turned out to be the case . On April 28 , two days after the first outbreak , the earth burst open at the 9,100-foot level and liquid rock gushed forth in a sluggish red-hot stream that destroyed , all before it . 400-Foot Columns of Lava Meanwhile lava was shooting into the air from the great crack in the grayish-brown dome at 12 , - 000 feet . The steaming fissure was three-eighths of a mile long , and at intervals fountains of lava spurted as high as 400 feet into the air . These fountains were twenty-five miles . from Hilo and could not be seen from many points on the island , but at night they were visible from the air for many miles as huge pillars of fire . White clouds reflected the glare . In a few hours a , wide river of rolling destruction had reached five or six miles across barren country . New sulphur beds appeared on a desolate landscape that strangely was occasionally blotched with snow . Lava from the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in five days the red burning stream lay in a smoking finger fourteen miles long and a half mile wide . For six miles the lava poured fast and smooth , forming the type known as pahoehoe . Then the stream turned sluggish , breaking into a rough smoldering type , which piled up a twenty-five foot rampart of hot rock . Lava Overruns Park Tumbling along at the rate of a half mile a day before unimaginable pressure , this great flowing wall leveled a park south of Hilo . The 011a plantation irrigation sluice and the Waikkea homestead settlement near Hilo were threatened , but the flow turned aside . The danger to Hilo , which has the only good harbor on the Island of Hawaii , is plainly shown in the topography . The summit of Manna Loa is twenty-five miles from the city . North of Mauna Loa , the dead volcano of Mauna Kea , which means " White Mountain , " rises 13.825 feet to a sharp peak , which is snow-covered in Winter . Between these two mountains lies a vast valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meager life from old lava flows known to date back as far as 1843 . The Wailuku River , one source of Hilo 's water supply , runs over the flow to the sea . There are no habitations in this sprawling wasteland except a few sheep and cattle stations belonging to the island 's big ranches . Bombers Used in 1935 Also Probably for the first time in history man tried to fight a volcano in 1935 , when a flow from Mauna Loa threatened to dam the Wailuku River at its source . This would have seriously impaired Hilo 's water supply . Army bombers dropped tons of high explosives in the path of the lava , throwing up walls of rock that successfully diverted the flow . This year 's flow was in the same region , so the same thing was done again , with results that have not been announced , although the lava , whether from the bombing or of its own accord , stopped short of any important damage . There was an even more serious threat to Hilo than the cutting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where three valleys form a natural trough between the live volcanoes of Mauna Loa and Kilauea . Volcanologists propose'that barriers be Built up in these valleys to divert lava that otherwise sometimes might flow down into the harbor . Eruptions of Mauna Loa seem to come in cydles of two and three years . The last , a more spectacular one , was in 1940 . This year 's activity came almost exactly at the time and place predicted by R. H. Finch , volcanologist at Hawaii National Park , after study of increasingly frequent earthquakes in the volcano region . On April 10 Mr. Finch issued a warning that an eruption was then imminent , but the information was withheld by the Army as being of military value .
