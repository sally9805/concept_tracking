M. Maurice Tillet is an amiable Frenchman who recently journeyed to the U. S. to engage in wrestling bouts . His nickname is " The Angel . " Much excited by photographs of his monstrous head were four enterprising young anthropologists at Harvard , Carlton Stevens Coon , Hallam Leonard Movius Jr. , Carl Coleman Seltzer and William Herbert Sheldon Jr . They wanted to measure it . Last week they announced that they had indeed taken the Angel 's measurements . <P> M. Tillet is the victim ( or , as a wrestler , the beneficiary ) of pituitary overdevelopment , resulting in acromegaly-enlargement of the face and jaws . The Harvardmen X-rayed his head , found the sella turcica , which houses the pituitary , considerably enlarged . They measured the tremendous , coffin-shaped face , found it 7.16 inches wide , 7.05 inches long from nose-bridge to jaw-point . They also noted huge protuberances over the eyebrows and at the back of the head , an elevation like a ridgepole from front to back of the cranium . <P> It seemed likely that pituitary excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing , otherwise he might have been a giant . His overdevelopment is lateral . Though just under 5 ft. 10 in. tall , he weighs 276 Ibs . One investigator declared : " The collar bones and rib cage are the most massive I have ever seen . . . . The tremendous nuchal back-of-the-neck musculature is quite beyond anything I have ever conceived . " <P> The anthropologists found M. Tillet " intelligent , very appealing , kindly and gentle . " In short , they liked him . At an afternoon party , he refused sherry and cigarets , took tea and cookies . Like most French commoners , he has a profound respect for the learned professions . He asked Earnest Albert Hooton , famed bellwether of Harvard anthropology , for a signed photograph . Hooton complied , and received from the Angel an elegant letter of thanks , in French , with practically no spelling mistakes . <P> Last week , back in his garish world of grab-grunt- &-grimace,; M. Tillet wrestled in Washington against one Alan Eustace . Five hundred would-be spectators were turned away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angel won , in 10 minutes .
