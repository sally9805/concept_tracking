A " singular and ideal " healing ointment for severe burns-long sought by good physicians-was announced last fortnight by Dr. Thomas F. P. Walsh of Chicago 's Mercy Hospital . He spoke before Cincinnati 's Institutum Divi Thomae , * whose staff , directed by Dr. George Speri Sperti , produced in their laboratory the ointment Dr. Walsh tested in the hospital . Dr. Sperti believes that the research work which produced the new treatment will " go down in history as second to none other , including the work of Pasteur . " <P> The new burn cure contains hormone-like substances which are extracted from yeast and fish-liver oils and stimulate the growth of any sort of cells . Applying this <P> " Biodyne " ointment to 100 patients in the burn clinic of Mercy Hospital , Dr. Walsh found that : <P> &gt; Unlike most chemical bactericides , the new ointment sterilized wounds without further destroying or devitalizing the injured tissues . <P> &gt; Took away all pain at once , so that narcotics and sedatives were unnecessary . <P> &gt; Quickened healing . Third-degree ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months for healing , were healed in an average of only 16.5 days if uninfected , in 20 days if infected . <P> &gt; Eliminated disfiguring scars in nearly all severe cases . <P> &gt; Made skin-grafting unnecessary in all cases . <P> In one typical case , a steelworker was horribly burned when molten metal filled his boot . After eight months of hospitalization and every type of conventional treatment from skin-grafting to sulfa drugs , his leg was still unhealed and infected , and he had a high fever . Several doctors decided that amputation was inevitable . Dr. Walsh took over and treated him with " Biodyne " ointment . In four months , the charred leg was good as new . <P> Exactly how the new substance works is not known . Theory is that , when some cells are injured or destroyed , the injured cells produce hormones which stimulate cellular multiplication so that the tissues heal . The Institutum scientists set out to manufacture these Hypothetical hormones ( which Dr. Sperti " christened " biodynes " ) in the laboratory so that they could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biodynes were created by exposing tissues from rat and chicken embryos to ultraviolet rays . This injured some of the cells and induced production of the healing substances in them . The scientists now extract the biodynes from 1 ) fish-liver oils and 2 ) heated yeast cells . The extracts are mixed with a petrolatum and lanolin base , sell for $3 a pound . Dr. Sperti said last week he could produce 1,000 pounds of " Biodyne " ointment a day if he had a priority for fish oils . The Chicago Fire Department has already adopted the new ointment , carries five pounds of it in all life-saving trucks . <P> <P> * A Catholic postgraduate research foundation , whose faculty members need not be Catholics but must not be atheists .
