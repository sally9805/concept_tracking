The nine-man band made sweet music that sounded like two marshmallows meeting headon . Its shuffling , danceable rhythm treacled out of a fair piano , a soggy sax , a toneless trumpet , a cooing clarinet and a bass . The feature acts , a good old square dance and the numbers the boys in the band clowned up in trick hats and phony mustaches , were strictly corny . But last week , while many another U.S. nightclub with tonier entertainment was as empty as the inside of a kettledrum , Chicago 's old standby , the Blackhawk Restaurant , could n't find room for all the customers who wanted it straight off the cob . <P> The trim little maestro who serves up this musical corn felt that its popularity was natural and deserved . Said Bandleader-Songwriter Al Trace : " We always knew this music was in for keeps . Other stuff comes &; goes , but this is the people . . . We play down to them , play requests and mention their names . We give them a good time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you miss ? " <P> No. 1 Hit . Cocksure little Al Trace was packing a spot where anyone had to be both good and loud to blow away the memories of more memorable bands-the famed Coon-Sanders orchestra ; or Ben Pollack 's band , which featured a young trombonist named Glenn Miller and a clarinetist named Benny Goodman . Kay Kyser had started his College of Musical Knowledge there . <P> But Al was n't worrying about the great past . He had already made a fortune collaborating on tunes like Little Sweetheart of the Ozarks , and songs for children ( he has none himself ) like The Sly Little Fox <P> ( " I just go into a dime store and get a kid 's story , twist it a bit and turn it into music " ) . His You Call Everybody Darling is the nation 's No. 1 song hit . ( His recording of it with his " Happiest Band in the Land " is also the No. 4 bestselling popular record . ) And last week , " so people will be sure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal doses of his latest number , Brush Those Tears from Your Eyes . <P> Under .300 . Trace , born in Chicago 44 years ago , once thought that baseball would be his career . But he gave up ball-playing when he concluded that he could never hit .300 . He knew how to bat the drums and sing a little- " I was what you call a dramatic tenor , singing The Road to Mandalay and stuff like that . " After writing songs and " running material " fof WLS ' National Barn Dance , he formed his own band . His first job : playing for Fan Dancer Sally Rand at Chicago 's 1933 World 's Fair . <P> Since then , Al has dropped his drumsticks for a baton and seldom musses his neat double-breasted suits even when he gets into the act on songs like The Mortgage Man . Most of the time , he circulates around the green-walled , silver-pillared Blackhawk to make the customers feel at home . They seem to .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
