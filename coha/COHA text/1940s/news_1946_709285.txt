txt Have you met Kern County 's " White Rose ? " You probably have , but California potato growers in this big desert patch 100 miles north of Los Angeles feel it has been too casual an acquaintanceship . They hate nearly a Slin million annual harvest to rush to market in a short three months ' season . Sn they are rolling the drums of a promotion parade . and are talking of spending at least 6100,000 a year on national advertismg to follow up " White Rose 's " debut in all 46 states during the war . From mid-May through June seven out of every ten potatoes served on American dinner tables are " White Roses " from Kern , the nation 's most important " early potato " county . The reason the season is so short is chiefly California 's climate . The crop has to grow so fast there is n't even time for blooming amid springtime s galaxy of wild flower blossoms . Planting ca n't be started too early  --  the season is in full swing now  --  because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spuds be left in the ground beyond mid-July because the 110-degrees-and-hotter sunshine will burn them . Planted Acreage Moves Higher Growers admit they ca n't do much about the weather to stretch out their crop season . They hope eventually to develop hardier or better storing strains of potatoes . but such experimental efforts . they say , are still so far in the future that the aim largely is wishful thinking now . Meanwhile , despite a temporary setback this season because of the fertilizer shortage , the year to year trend m planted acreage as moving steadily upward . That will mean more potatoes to sell , and growers think the beet way to avoid over-production as to build consumer demand by deliberate promotion . Except in years when there is a national over-supply of potatoes , which means a big carryover of the old crop . Kern 's " White Roses " hit the market about the time " old " potatoes are cleaned out . For example , at the end of last month the nation had 119 million bushels of potatoes in cold storage . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the middle of May , with the big shipments coming in April when there may be a temporary glut because carryover this year is 15% larger than last . When the " early " potatoes start appearing in mid-May most of the old crop will have been used Fertilizer Shortage Hits Planting Potato growing has pyramided phenomenally in California , practically all of it in Kern , the past quarter century  --  from only 300 acres in 1920 to 59.000 last year . A decline of around 5.000 acres this spring is'due only to lack of fertilizer , which , in part , is a repercussion of the steel strike . One of the mills ' by-products , ammonium sulphate , must be added to the soil to raise potatoes . Nitrogen also is required . Making potato-land here is very simple and there are some 50,000 more acres yet to be broken . The recipe oalls first for clearing off sagebrush and other plant life , often to the consternation of wild flower lovers who resent the encroachment . Then several hundred pounds of fertilizer and 15 sacks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other row is irrigated every other day with water pumped from subsurface . Potatoes will grow quickly in about 110 days . with two or three cultivations until the plants are big enough to crowd out any weeds After three or four years of potatoes , the crop must he rotated with alfalfa or cotton or some other of a half hundred different things Kern County can grow . Thus , even with 50.000 potential additional acres , there wo n't be any grand total of 100,000 acres any year in potatoes . The relatively poor yield of 10 sacks to the acre last season indicates that some of the land has reached the point of diminishing returns after wartime accelerated use . Growers maintain their patch never will reach an caer-production stage if wider distribution of " White Rose " is achieved The only other potatoes on the market ( April through June ) when the California crop heads east are mostly holdover old ones . Yield Over ' 200 Sacks Per Acre Other than having the taste edge of " new " over " old . " Kern County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are about double the average in other producing areas There 's never a crop fell ut e , because irrigation answers the drought threat and bugs and insects are n't allowed to enter the state . Rigid inspection of incoming automobiles for vegetables and fruit-carrying pests and germs pays off handsomely in a more profitable agriculture , farmers say , even though tourists resent being stopped at the border stations and asked to empty out their luggage . Despite a freight differential in shipping across the nation of about a $1 a seek , California growers say they can take care of thernseli es . They resent talk of Greernment acreage quotas . They propose to keep federal agents with restrictions just where potato bt.ge are kept ? quarantined outside Cabforma Getting at least $2 a sack . year in and year out , a Celiternia acre producing 20() sacks grosses $100 This compares with other parts of the country averaging , say , 100 sacks at $3 , or only $300 to the acre . Besides , dry-farming areas some years do n't get a good crop . Potatoes must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restricting California planting ' . , growers point to what happened in Ireland once upon a time The Irish liked pet ttoes se well they depended upon them as a major food When a set . ere di ought . ha , starvation threatened Ireland until imports came and that 's why all potatoes ( except sweet potatoes ) are called " Irish . " despite their origination in South America . " White Rose " is just one ofmany varieties of " Irish " potatoes . Other better knoWn ones are Idaho " Ruswits. " early " Ohio 's " and the " Bliss Triumph . " As California 's crop is already harvested before a drought might ruin the crop in other potato areas , and it 's too late to plant more in the hot desert soil , any restricted production here would only aggravate the situation , growers claim . Even though hugs are kept out of California . the potato industry got a scare some six or seven years ago when bacterial ring rot threatened in wipe out the business . Over half the acreage was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried by only the potatoes and was not in the soil . Seed Stock Carefully Seleeted Up to this time it was customary to plant any nice-looking store potatoes . But with disease threatening to kill the industry a new start was made on seed . Clean stock was brought in and seed-growing farms and greenhouses were organized by a new association set-up to promote seed improvement in Kern County . By using healthy seed , and keeping a constant vigil in the fields to pull up diseased plants as soon as they appeared sick the threat wa-s whipped in a year . But the assets derived from the seed tintato program are still growing . At present over 60% of the county 's 750.000 sacks of seed a year are home-grown . Yields per acre have increased with the use of better planting stock . The $1 per sack more for approved seed is more than paid for . Now that $15-a-day war jobs are gone , growers hope their $6-a-day wages for backbreaking potato picking will attract workers . In pre-war days , potato men say , their higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other farmers . With the exception of the picking-lap job , most potato t nrrning is mechanized. from planting and cultivating to digging . Attempts to develop a " picker-upper " have n't been successful , howeNer , because a machine snatches chunks of dirt and rocks as well as potatoes . Like the crop itself , harvesting is a hurried affair in Kern County . Potatoes ca n't be left on top of the ground long , nor can they remain sacked under the sun and sri the hot wind  - -  or they 'll bake . Even at the pacing house they are quickly washed , screened for size ( U. S. No. l's. the biggest commeroie.le , meet be at least 1i , y inches fn diameter ) and sacked . Then they are loaded on the freight oars and headed out of town . Ity this time growers have sold thew orop for cash 1.0 b . Kern County ( usually Bakersfield ) . Eastern buyers have representatives out in the potato rows bidding for the harvest , and so far there has been no necessity for the growers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization for citrus . Potatoes Under Price Ceilings Potato growers still are marketing wider ceilings and floors established during the war . Ceiling prices are on a sliding scale , beginning at 53 35 a sack up to March al ? which is before any Kern County spuds are harvested  --  and then are reduced at fortnightly Intervals until June when the ceiling Is S2 40 a sack . Last year the average return to growers here was $2.60 a sack , they hope to do as well this year . The floor under prices is set by the Governments " parity " and subsidy system In Kern County in 1941 more than half a million sacks of unmarketable potatoes were purchased by the Government under its eubsiciy program at a cost of nearly $700,000 . Most of these were smaller than U. S. No. 1 grade and were dehydrated in a plant at Bakersfield . Subsequently this plant burned . The railroads  --  the Santa Fe . Southern Pacific and Union Pacific  --  have a big stake in Kern County potatoes . For instance , during the harvesting season night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 15 tons to a car ) after a peak picking day . Growers think the railroads should help promote their spuds . The Santa Fe may start the hall rolling by serving " White Roses " in dining cars and calling diners ' attention to the menu attraction .
