Perhaps the most remarkable document in the annals of U.N . was submitted to the Assembly last week . It was part of a report by the U.N . Headquarters Commission on a permanent U.N . site , and was written by the French commission member , one of the world 's most-touted architects , Le Corbusier. *The mind which produced the dictum- " An artist who paints a dog to look like a dog is himself a dog of the lowest kind " - came to several revolutionary conclusions about U.N . ' s permanent home . Samples : <P> " The word ' World Capital ' is nothing but ambiguity . . . bloated with false deductions . . . . Confronting such a menace , the inhabitants of Connecticut , terror-stricken , took the bit between their teeth and flatly voted against the invasion of their domain . ... If the word ' Headquarters ' brings to mind ' LIFE , ' ' World Capital ' brings to mind ' ACADEMISM . ' And here we come to ... the very basis of the debate : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By academism we mean : to evaluate things by ingrained custom . . . . But life is different , unbridled , without respect . . . . The U.N. , spontaneous creation in the fading hour of a society outmoded by the elan of a new life , must take heed ! Bad shepherds are not lacking ! . . . <P> " Let us weigh the sites : New York is a terrifying city . ... A great spectacle of power but also of disorder . Flushing . Meadows : the practical goals are seemingly attained . But that is not enough .. . . Feeling , in the last analysis , leads man by the nose . . . . Ridge field , Amawalk , Blue Mountain : seen from an airplane these desolate territories strike one with anguish , foretelling a fatal adventure marked with the sign of death . . . . White Plains , Greenwich , Round Hills : ... a privileged region . . . polished and policed . . . . The region ' breathes . ' Here one feels is a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walking Up . Le Corbusier suggests a " vertical garden city " consisting of tall , compact buildings surrounded by nature . He plans for everything , from freeing " the housewife from her daily servitude " to the Assembly 's " Hall of Lost Footsteps " ( lobby ) to his favorite project : a world museum , shaped like a pyramid . " One can go up on foot outside following the roof arranged as a road , the spiral mounting to the top . ... I have never been considered a great romanticist . However , I can well imagine two opponents of Assembly or Council room starting the road leading to the top . . . they discuss and argue . . . they are unyielding , irreconcilable . . . they know no common denominator . . . . But now they are on top , before the door . They enter . They go down the road , but this time take it on the inside . These two men will part differently than when they met.
