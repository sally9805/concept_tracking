Radio receivers on ships at sea have been silenced since war began . Reason : an ordinary receiving set sends out radiations of its own that can be detected by an enemy submarine . Sailors chafe at this restriction because radioed baseball scores and news bulletins used to be one of the high spots of their day . Government officials suspect that they occasionally give their ships away by surreptitious tuning in , mistakenly supposing that if they keep volume low the enemy can not hear them . <P> Last fortnight Chicago 's E. H. Scott Radio Laboratories announced an invention whereby ships could safely turn on their radios again . It is a new receiver that cuts down oscillator radiation so that it can not be picked up more than 25 feet away . Standard Oil of New Jersey has already equipped a fleet of tankers with the new sets ; the Navy and freighter lines are following suit .
