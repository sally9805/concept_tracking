Until pachydermatous ( 275 lb . ) Frederick Riebel Jr . was ousted from his $30,000-a-year job as president of Brewster Aeronautical Corp . three weeks ago , he kept his mouth tightly closed . But last week , before the House Naval Affairs Committee , which is probing Brewster 's snail-paced production , Mr. Riebel rattled all the Brewster skeletons in public . <P> Sometimes weeping softly , sometimes roaring with rage , frog-voiced Mr. Riebel blamed all the troubles at Brewster on the " hellish " contract it had with C.I.O. 's United Automobile Workers . He lashed out at the union 's tough , headstrong boss , Tom De Lorenzo , impaled lesser officials as " punks and heels , " denounced the local itself as that " gang of forty thieves . " Carefully he explained that those opinions had grown in him only after he came to Brewster , last March . He had cozied up to the union . Said he : " I got in bed with Tom De Lorenzo , with the cover tucked right up to my chin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Baffled Bundler . But Bundler Riebel soon found out that " every time I got in bed with Tom De Lorenzo I got out with less than I went in with . " Riebel stopped bundling , started battling . He got nowhere that way , either . Meanwhile he had other troubles , which he tried to solve by firing top Brewster officials . <P> And in the nation 's weirdest war plant , he found such things as this : Brewster was trying to build dive-bombers for the British without complete drawings of the plane or a list of materials needed . <P> Committeemen properly asked : In view of all this , could Brewster 's new president , Shipbuilder Henry J. Kaiser , get Brewster into production ? <P> Replied Riebel : " Oh , I 've dreaded that question more than any the committee could ask . It 's a matter of embarrassment to a dear , dear friend of mine . . . . I say a little prayer every night for Kaiser 's success at Brewster . " <P> Certain Kaiser . But pachydermatous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed no embarrassment , wanted no prayers . He calmly stated that Brewster 's failure to produce planes for the British and for the U.S. Navy was due to lack of cooperation between labor &; management . He promised to end this and get Brewster producing on schedule . <P> But the Navy , which finds Brewster 18 months behind schedule on contracts totaling $175,000,000 , is almost sick &; tired of the whole thing . Retired Navy Captain George C. Westervelt , who ran Brewster for a month when the Navy took it over , reiterated the ominous warning given by James V. Forrestal , Under Secretary of the Navy . He told the committee : if Kaiser fails , all of Brewster 's Navy contracts should be transferred to other companies .
