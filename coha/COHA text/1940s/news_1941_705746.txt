txt Two Northwestern university psychologists have struck out into uncharted ways to demonstrate a method by which proud parents can tell before Junior is 12 weeks old whether he is smart as a whip or just a touch dull for his age . One device employed by the psychologists-requires alcohol , a commodity found in many homes . Put some in an eyedropper , lay Junior on his back , and let a drop fall on his tummy . The alcohol will create a cold spot as it condenses , and , according to Dr. A. R. Gilliland , Junior will do one of the following things : 1 . Suck in his stomach to try to get away from that nasty old clammy feeling . That means he 's smart , says Dr. Gilliland. 2 , Pull up his legs , kick , and wriggle . That means he 's a little less sharp . Thirty Babies Tested , Dr. Gilliland and his associate , Dr. John J. 33 . Morgan , tried their tests on no babies nt the Cradle , Flynn-. ton 's famous adoption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Dr. Gilliland said , " You ca n't ask them questions . So we hare to Use motor performances as an index . We try to put our tests in terms of something they can learn to do . " Altho the results are still highly experimental , Dr. Gilliland said that he and Dr. Morgan have obtained some tentative findings on expected performance . For instance , by four weeks an infant should be able to focus his eyes on a steel tape held before him and to follow its movement horizontally . At 8 weeks he should be able to follow its movements perpendicularly . At 12 weeks he should follow it if it is swung in a circle . Try This on Junior . Another test suggested for the parent , if he happens to be opening a package of cigarets , is to smooth out the cellophane and drop it over Junior 's face . If Junior has n't caught onto things yet , he 'll orobahly just let It pass , with maybe a dirty look at the old man . If he 's getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off with his hands or by wagging his head . Drs . Gilliland and Morgan hope to work out standards eventually to determine which infants are bright and which , it any , might grow up to be no credit to the family
