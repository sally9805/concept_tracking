THE MARINES ' WAR ( 456 pp. ) - Fletcher Pratf-Sloane ( $5 ) . <P> <P> On that September morning , a Japanese lieutenant of machine cannon on the island of Peleliu looked out over the Pacific Ocean and noted in his diary that what he saw made him " so furious I could feel the blood pounding in my veins throughout my body . " The U.S. Marines had come , and with them a naval escort that stretched as far as the eye could see . After ten days of pounding , the warships and carrier planes ceased fire , and a transport commander said complacently to a Marine colonel : " Everything 's done over there . You 'll walk in . " Replied the colonel : " If you think it 's that easy why do n't you come on the beach at five o'clock , have supper with me , and pick up a few souvenirs ? " <P> At 5 o'clock the ist Marine Division on Peleliu had made only 200 yards . The Japanese lieutenant had noted in his diary that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one man in his company was hurt . Snug in their caves , the Japanese waited until the first wave hit the beach , then , " the guns on point and island opened , many of those back in the ridge , and a mortar barrage so heavy that those who lived through it said it was the worst they had ever seen . " By nightfall there were 1,298 dead &; wounded Marines , the beachhead was secure and the diary of the Japanese lieutenant , now dead , was being read at Marine headquarters . But almost two months later , a U.S. colonel was killed by a sniper on Peleliu as he stepped from a plane . <P> The Shock of Battle . According to Fletcher Pratt , Peleliu was the Marines ' hardest battle . None of them was easy , though he calls the assault on Tinian " perfection . " Pratt , one of the best of the civilian war analysts , wrote The Marines ' War at the Marine Corps ' request , but on three conditions , all granted : that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese records ; permission to interview eyewitnesses ; complete freedom of opinion . The result is a fine service history written with clarity and intelligence , one that many Marines will welcome as an authoritative corrective to their own unit histories . <P> Author Pratt has told the Marines ' story so simply and graphically that civilian readers will share the feel of battle , and so soundly that the book could serve as a text on amphibious warfare . <P> Pratt has made good use of captured Japanese documents . The Marines ' War is , to a lesser extent , also the Japanese defenders ' war . If ever Japan 's military schools re-open for business , their instructors will find here a succinct catalogue of Japanese army and navy mistakes . Says Pratt : " One is struck by the fact that the Japanese leaders , naval and military ' , were always waiting for somebody else to do something . ... In actual contacts , of course , much of the Japanese failure can be traced to the mystical belief that a man with Bushido and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a bellyful of beans . This piece of irrationalism is fundamental . . . . The true failure lies rather in that tenacity of which the Japanese were so very proud-their persistence in error , their unwillingness to alter a plan once it had been set in operation . "
