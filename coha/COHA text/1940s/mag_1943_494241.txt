This Is the Enemy It is high time that the . American consumer recognized his enemies in Congress . That body is at present controlled by a bloc which is deliberately bent upon inflation . The House of Representatives is apparently-about to follow the dictation of this group by passing an appropriation bill for the Commodity Credit Corporation which contains an amendment forbidding the use of subsidies to increase output or keep prices down , and by passing a tax bill to raise only one-fifth the amount which the Treasury had set as a minimum . The . Senate may do better on either or both measures , but so , far there is little sign that it will The inflationary bloc consists of an alliance between the Republicans and the reactionary Southern Democrats . Their dominant motive is to discredit the administration , at whatever cost to the nation and the citizens . Behind them , - and directing their action , is an alliance between leaders of the conservative farm organizations and certain reactionary manufacturers . The farm leaders are betraying their constituents by their stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present by inflation , they would later lose by it . Only the big industrialist gains by inflation in the end ; and he gains only if the system which shelters him is not cracked by the strain . Give the Country Time The arguments which these interests use are disingenuous in the extreme . The farmers are told , for instance , that subsidies are inflationary , whereas it isperfectly obvious that the price increases which would follow their abolition would be far more inflationary . The farmers are also told that subsidies are contrary to the American system , whereas if the farmers had not received enormous subsidies in the past twenty years , there would be little agriculture left in America . Those who use these arguments are not misinformed ; they are simply dishonest . Ample information about the matter has been given to Congress by the administration and by disinterested experts . The general public is now being educated , especially by the vigorous broadcasts of such popular news commentators as Walter Winchell and Raymond Gram Swing . If enough time can be gained by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a surge of informed and angry public opinion . But if that is to happen , the public must not let itself be fooled by its enemies , who are trying to make scapegoats of labor and the President . That Mysterious Meeting During most of last week the press and the radio all over the world were spreading reports that Roosevelt , Churchill and Stalin were about to meet , or perhaps , already meeting . We have no special inside information on this subject , and would n't reveal it if we had . We hope , however , that the reports are true and that the results of the conference are soon announced . We hope also that , as our Washington correspondent suggests in this issue , Chiang Kai-shek may have been one of the conferees . The commentators have been speculating that the meeting would formulate a final warning and offer to the German people that if they do not capitulate at once , action against them on all fronts will be speeded up to the maximum degree until Germany is destroyed . Such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from several directions , would seem to us the best of sense . And after that , Japan . Ashore in the Gilberts The attack on Makin and Tarawa Islands in the Gilbert group represents an important knew phase of : the war against japan . If we can hold these islands ? and it is'eertain that we wotild , not ? ave gone ashore unless the , military prospect was favorable ? we shall have started what - might rbe , called ' a marine pincers movement against the great Japanese base , at Truk , with the operations in the SOlomons , New Britain and New Guinea as the other jaw of the pincers . To be sure , before reaching Truk we must first takeother Japanese bases in the Marshalls , at Wake and-elsewhere . If this is to be the main line of our attack on Japan , a long hard Toad lies " before us . On the other hand , the attack on the:Gilberts may be only diversionary , and the main thrust may be sudden , powerful and from an entirely different - direction . Overconfidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Gilberts most reports from the battle fronts had been rather gloomy for some days . In Russia , the.Germans launched a , powerful counter-offensive , and for the ' first time since early summer ' they forced the Red Army to - fall back . Nazi troops captured several more of ' the Dodecanese Islands , overwhelming the small British garrisons which had been put there when Italy went tout of the war . In Yugoslavia , Tito 's men were under fierce German ' attack . ' In ' Italy , our forces were just-beginning to advance again ? after being almost halted for about a fortnight , partly by bad weather , ? partly by stiff enemy resistance . In the Southwest Pacific , aside from the landing in the Gilberts , we continued to gain , but in no spectacular fashion . The bombing - Germany went on , in heavy force , and presumably must have inflicted serious damage . Bombing of this sort constitutes a new technique in warfare and there are therefore no firm precedents to justify confident assertions as to the amount of damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may serve a useful purpose if they destroy the ridiculous overconfidence that exists within the United States . Both Germany and Japan are still extremely powerful nations , with large armies and , in the case of Japan , a formidable fleet . They ' have been trained far better than ourselves to endure ' hardship and sacrifice . The Japanese are being taught that this is a hundred-year war and that Japan will finally win ' because of her staying power . Both our enemies have the ? greatpresent advantage ( though it may become a liability in case of attack from several directions ) of fighting on interior lines , with comparatively short and easy communications . Neither of them suffers the handicaps inherent in the organization of a democratic state , which allows advocates of a soft peace to hamper the war effort even , in our own case , as members of the House of Representatives and the ' Senate . The enemy is all out for victory ; we can count ourselves lucky if we are 6o to 7o percent out , so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II of Rumania , now living in exile in ' Mexico , would . hardly deserve any mention in these pages , were it not for three " ifs " : if he had ' not hired ; the public-relations firm of Russell Birdwell and Associates at$35,000 a year to . sell " his majesty to the people of the United States ; if he tad not been announced as a featured speaker on the Columbia Broadcasting System 's dramatized - news program , Report to the Nation , ; and if our State Department could safely be relied upon to keep its ears closed to the ex-king 's plea for permission to come ito the United States . Whatever reasons Carol may have for wishing to enter this.country , whether he wants to get hold of the $80,000,000 of frozen Rumanian funds , or Whether , he hopes to-convince the State Department of his political usefulness as a self-styled " free Rumanian " after the Nazis have - been driven out of this former kingdom , the American - people are entitled to be informed of this record . For when Carol hired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' according to The New York Times - of , Oetober s " 943 , that c " I have been misrepresented in some journalistic quarters , " and : he declared his intention ' - " to tell any story truthfully - and wholly whenever it is desired in the " hope that I -- aand the democratic cause for which I fought and still wish to fight ? will receive a fair and proper hearing : " What the King Might Say As Carol says he - intends to tell the truth , he might be expected to say something like this : " The greatest mistake of my royal career was jumping too late on the Nazi bandwagon . That 's the reason why Rumania lost the Dobrudja to Bulgaria , Bessarabia to the Soviet Union and a part of Transylvania to Hungary . My countrymen did not like that , and - needing a. scapegoat , they picked on me and booted me out . It was altogether unjust . For I had done all in ? my power to save Rumania by pleasing Hitler . ' In 1937 I appeased , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iron Guard by appointing as Premier the violently reactionary and anti-Semitic Goga . In ' February , 1938 , I myself assumed dictatorial power'and ' formed a one party state . In 1939 I paid a visit to Hitler and arranged a new trade treaty with ' Germany . On April 25 , 1940 , NOVEMBER 29 , T 9 4 3 I granted amnesty to all the Iron Guardists , whom I had doublecrossed because Hitler wanted it . Soon afterwards I negotiated with the Iron Guard for the purpose of forming a full-fledged totalitarian regime favorable to the Axis . On June 21 , 1940 , as soon as my old ally France fell , I formed the new ' Party of the Nation ' with Iron Guard support . I even appealed to my people to change their entire mental attitude and accept the ' New Order . ' My friend , Iron Guard leader Horia Sima , had only praise for me . Did he not say that ' the King 's new party will enable us to face the future ' ? But for some mysterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distrusted me , and the Iron Guardists deserted me as soon as the going got tough . I had tried my best to please Hitler and the Iron Guard . I am very sorry about all this now . " Do Carol 's publicity men tell us this ? No . They insist that he was the first monarch to fight fascism openly . If this were true , why would Carol need the services of a high-powered American public-relations counsel ? Why does he not rely on democratic Rumanians in exile ? Because they do n't want him . And neither do the people of Rumania . And neither do we . After Thirty Years Thirty years ago , Leo Frank , a Brooklyn Jew , was convicted of murder in Georgia , forcibly removed from jail by a party of masked men and lynched . Last week , Arthur G. Powell , a former judge of the Georgia Court of Appeals , revealed that he knew Leo Frank was innocent . He stated that he must withhold his information , which was given to him as an attorney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case ? are dead . The case , which attracted national attention , centered about the murder of Mary Phagan who worked in a pencil factory , in Atlanta , of which Frank was the secretary . The most shocking aspect of the case is the fact that so many persons connected with it knew all along that Frank was innocent . A. M. Roan , the trial judge who charged the jury , had told Powell " this man 's innocence is proved to mathematical certainty , " while John M. Slaton , Governor of Georgia at the time of the trial , was also convinced of Frank 's innocenCe , but refused to pardon him , according to Powell 's testimony , because " he realized that unless he let Frank be hanged he would forfeit all his political popularity and ambitions . " These revelations will not bring an innocent man back to life . But there is no reason why Powell 's information should be withheld until " certain persons " go to the grave , presumably with blood on their hands , or guilty knowledge in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How he knew that Frank was innocent should at once be brought to light in a review of the entire case . 733 Why Should Mosley Go Free ? From across the ocean , it is difficult to surmise what may have led the British government to release Sir Oswald Mosely , an out-and-out Fascist who was doing his best , at the time of his imprisonment , to duplicate Hitler 's career . It is said that he is ill ; but there are prison hospitals , and other prisoners are not set ' free merely because of impaired health . Judging from the dispatches , British opinion is deeply angered by the action . Labor , in particular , has made public protest . We hope for its own sake that the British government has some better explanation than has thus far been vouchsafed , and will make it public with the least possible delay . The argument that he has never been tried and should be released for this reason seems a specious one . Why not try him promptly , instead of giving him tacit endorsement by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of a wage increase for non-operating railway employees , the Senate again is showing its willingness to be a party to special-interest legislation . It has been no secret around ' Washington that even the usually tight-fisted War Labor Board protested Economic Stabilizer Vinson 's ruling against the eightcents-an-hour pay boost , these railroad workers have been demanding . Vinson thought that such an increase was unjustifiable in view of the hold-the-line policy . Maybe he was right ; maybe not . Congress is now looking favorably on a joint resolution introduced by Senator Truman and Representative Crosser which would abrogate Vinson 's veto and allow the eight-cent increase . A. Senate subcommittee has already reported favorably on the bill . The railway unions are so well organized politically that ? it is possible that Congress will enact this proposed legislation . If it does , it will have undermined the stabilization authority vested in Vinson . Such action would be a sign to all other groups denied wage - increases by Vinson to take their appeal over  - -  his head to Congress . It is hard to see bow our present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to - undermine it in this ' fashion . .
