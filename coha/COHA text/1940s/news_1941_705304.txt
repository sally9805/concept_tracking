txt Fullest possible material assistance should be extended to Great Britain by the United States in the interest of her own self-defense , regardless of whether this country ever gets a dollar back in the transaction , William S. Knudsen , Director General of the Office of Production Management , told the House Foreign Affairs Committee today . Mr. Knudsen went before the House body to urge favorable and speedy action on lend-lease bill , authorizing President Roosevelt to transfer guns , munitions , ships and other material of war to foreign countries in the interest of American defense . Emphasizing that he was a production man , interested only in getting things done , Mr. Knudsen sought to avoid any general conclusion as to what may happen in the future or in the present world crisis . He would leave those matters , he said , to men like Secretaries Hull and Stimson , in whom he had utmost confidence . He did say , however , that it was his belief that the United States could not avoid war if Britain fell . Endorses Plan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , der to speed up aid to Britain under what he considered the accepted policy , to standardize production in a manner which would be made feasible under the formula set out in the President 's proposal . Mr. Knudsen 's estimate of the value of British aid to American defense came in answer to questions from Representative Richards of South Carolina . " Do you believe that passage of this bill will facilitate our defense regardless of Great Britain ? " Mr. Richards asked . " Yes , " replied Mr. Knudsen . " And you believe it to be to our interest to pass it and aid Great Britain , in our own defense , whether we get back a dollar or not ? " " I certainly do , " Mr. Knudsen responded . Before this summing up of his position on the bill , Mr. Knudsen had spent nearly two hours before the committee , answering questions shot at him by members . In the course of the exchange he told the committee that it would probably be late in this year before any great increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products are taken out of existing facilities . He placed Britain 's present rate of purchases at about 35 per cent of our total defense production , or around $3,000,000,000 to $4,000,000 , - 000 annually " All Important Thing " Stressed He intimated that plans were on foot to step up that ratio in favor of the British under the terms of the pending bill . And he advised the committee to treat as a secondary matter the question of economic adjustment after the war . " The all-important thing now is to get the job done . " said the defense chief . Indications grew throughout the questioning of Mr. Knudsen that the Administration forces , led by Chairman Bloom , had decidedly the upper hand on the committee . The opposition , shepherded by Representative Fish of New York , will call its witnesses when the hearings are resumed on Tuesday . When Mr. Bloom announced that Wendell L. Willkie bad declined to appear because as be was preparing to leave for Europe on Wednesday , Representative Tinkham of Massachusetts , angrily demanded that he be subpoenaed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their foreign affairs almost every morning of late , " Mr. Tinkham said . " I think we ought to summon him here and examine him as to competency . What knowledge has he ot the country 's foreign relations ? What background has he that qualifies him to give the advice he is giving daily ? Those are things the country ought to know . " Mr. Bloom said the committee had no authority to subpoena a witness and hence turned aside Mr. Tinkham 's suggestion . The chairman predicted that the hearings would last throughout most of next week , as the Administration intends reserving some of its witnesses for rebuttal , in case the opposition makes any dent in the preponderance of sentiment which now seems to be running strongly in favor of the basic idea behind the measure . Mr. Knudsen resisted all attempts of committee members to draw him into abstract discussions on the philosophy of the bill . He did not regard the bill as giving him any more power to deal with the defense production problem , and he did not know today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His answers were short and direct given in the slight Danish accent and with the bashful smile that are rapidly becoming part of the Knudsen legend in Washington . At one point Representative Luther Johnson of Texas asked Mr. Knudsen why he had left a $150,000-a-year position in private industry in order to accept his post in the Defense Commission with no salary at all . " I do n't want to sound sentimental , " Mr. Knudsen replied , " but I had been working in this country for more than forty years . It had been pretty good to me . I was in a position to work for nothing , and I felt that if I could do something for the country , I would like to do it . That 's all . " Mr. Knudsen had no more than finished this little story when the audience and the committee , including members on both sides , broke into applause . Mr. Knudsen 's face reddened and he appeared quite embarrassed . " Do you think , " continued Mr. Johnson , " that it is necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time ? " " I do , " said Mr. Knudsen . " What , then , is the matter of first importance now ? " " To get America armed so that we can protect our shores . " Possibility of War Discussed Representative Shanley of Connecticut said Congress must assume that passage of the bill will be regarded by the totalitarian powers as an act of war . " Assuming that , are the production facilities of this country geared up so that the countrZ could go into a war ? " asked Mr. Shanley . " In other words , is there anything further that Congress should do ? " " There might be , " Mr. Knudsen replied . " I might be able to suggest something after I have had a chance to look into the situation a little more . I think we have everything we need now , however . " Mr. Knudsen stepped into the realm of prophecy only when he expressed the belief that if Britain lost the United States would eventually become involved in a war with the Axis powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in reply to a question put I by Representative Arnold of Illinois as to whether we would be drawn into a war if Britain were defeated . I " That in time we would have to fight a war anyway ? " continued Mr. Arnold . " Yes , sir , " replied Mr. Knudsen . Representative Rogers of Massa ' chusetts tried vainly to get Mr. Knudsen to express an opinion as to whether the United States should require collateral for defense materials advanced to Britain . " I 'm not in the finance business , " Mr. Knudsen said . " My business is to make things . I have to depend upon the people in charge of that ( financing ) to do what is right . I think the things should be made . " He said later that it might be nice to have collateral , " but are n't we a little beyond that ? " Mr. Knudsen told Representative Vorys that no legislation would be necessary in addition to the pending bill to standardize and coordinate American and British procurement . Procurement by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill , is the most practical thing to do , Mr. Knudsen said . Says President Is Prompt Representative Burgin asked whether passage of the bill would already in reality an ally of Great Britain , " Mrs. Rogers asked . Chairman Bloom ruled the question out of order before Mr. Knud:en had time to reply . Mr. Johnson questioned the wit:less on the relationship between himself and the President , and the latter 's attitude toward him and the defense set-up . " I stick to my last , " Mr. Knudsen replied . " Whenever I have anything to take up with the President I always get from him fine and prompt action . " Late today Mr. Fish said that Joseph P. Kennedy would appear before the committee on Tuesday , I with Norman Thomas and Hanford to follow on Wednesday , and Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh and General Hugh S. Johnson on Thursday . In addition to these five witnesses , Mr. Fish said , the minority will produce at least five others before the hearings are concluded . increase the chances of getting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed , 100 per cent , the less are the chances for war , " Mr. Knudsen replied . " I take it that you think we are
