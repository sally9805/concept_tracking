txt DATE IS ADVANCED Reduction Provided in Mayor 's Bills Will Be , Effective Oct. 27 DEMOCRATS ARE CRITICAL Assail La Guardia as They Aid His Measures  --  Board of Estimate Ratifies Them After a week of partisan manoeuvring the City Council voted unanimously yesterday for Mayor La Guardia 's bills reducing the sales and compensating use taxes from 3 and 2 per cent to a flat 1 per cent , with the prospect that the reduction will become effective on Oct. 27 . Chairman Joseph E. Kinsley of the finance committee said the advancing of the effective date demolished Mayor La Guardia 's argument that the Council should have acted last week to provide tax relief by Nov. 1 . Vice Chairman Joseph T. Sharkey , leader of the Democratic majority , said he would keep two bills before the Council , one cutting the levies to one-half of 1 per cent and the second abolishing them entirely . He expressed the hope that the . La Guardia administration would increase relief allowances this Winter to get recipients above a " starvation level , " and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when ' the Board of Estimate concurred in the Council 's action . Cites Soaring Living CostsDiscussing his two bills , Mr. Sharkey said : " The cost of living is skyrocketing daily , causing the lot of the unemployed , many of whom are unemployable , to become increasingly pitiful . I therefore make the Mayor this offer . If he will give the people on relief an increased allowance to enable them to live through the Winter on something better than a starvation level I will not press for the passage of these bills . But if he refuses I will fight for their enactment , no matter what the consequences . " This is blood money , taken from the residents of this city under the pretense that the money is used for the relief of the unemployed . The fact is that the money is being held by the city to tide it over its continuous financial emergencies I make you ' this promise right now . If the money collected for unemployment relief is not given to the unemployed I 'll see to it that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Estimate , at a special meeting , ratified the Council 's action , Borough President Cs qhrnore , a Democrat , said : " I think this tax should either be eliminated or cut below 1 per cent . However , I will vote for these bills on the theory that half a loaf is better than no bread . Any surplus should be used to meet higher living costs for those on relief and should not be used to meet other city expenses . " " Mayor Wrong , " Says Kinsley Councilman Kinsley estimated that the tax cuts would save $30 , - 000,000 to $35,000,000 a year . Commenting on them , he said : " The Mayor has finally conceded that he is wrong again and that the reduction in the emergency . taxes which he now offers as a last-minute stimulant to his rapidly fading hopes of re-election should have been made at least four months ago . " In the opinion of your committee , the proposed reduction is not enough , in view .. of the admission of the Controller , that he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current year expenditures which will not be made until 1943 and 1944 . " This is an outstanding demonstration of the financial hokum which the Solicitor General of New York so scathingly denounced . " These deductions total $19,006. - 000 . None of this money will be spent during the present fiscal year and actually will be on hand at its close . " The Controller 's attempt to make it appear that the surplus // CUT IN SALES TAX TO 1% IS ADOPTED // on hand is so low that no further cut in taxes can be made is a barefaced fraud on a long suffering public . " The actual surplus on hand as of Sept. 30 , 1941 , was $20,683 , - 032.74 , and not the mere $1,677 , - 032 . T4 which the Controller re : : ported . " Further and drastic reduction in these taxes can be made , but the Mayor refuses to send the message necessary for the immediate passage of such bills . " Councilman Walter R. Hart , Brooklyn Democrat , described the tax bills as another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mayor had been playing for the last six months . Others , he said , were the recent cut in rates on the Staten Island Ferry and an assessment reduction in Queens . " Is there anyone on the other side of the house with the umniti. gated gall to say that the Mayor was not playing politics when he introduced these tax reductions last week ? " he demanded . Mrs. Genevieve B. Earle , minority leader , and her cohorts did not answer Mr. Hart . Speaking for the minority , Mrs. Earle said that the Mayor 's proposals , introduced by Council President Newbold Morris , were so fair that no minority report was needed . After the sales and compensating use tax bills had been adopted , a committee of the Council held a public hearing on Vice Chairman Sharkey 's move to cut water rates by about $5,700,000 a year . Patrick J. Quilty , Commissioner of Water Supply , Gas and Electricity , warned the committee that the cut would produce a deficit of about $3,700,000 this year . He challenged the Council 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed only by himself with the approval of the Board of Estimate . Under questioning by Councilman William A. Carroll , Mr. Quilty said his department had received $70,000,000 more from orate : rates in the last seven years thar it cost to supply water . He said the profit in 1934 was $7,097,000 , $12,006,000 in 1935 , $12,520,000 in 1936 , $11,015,000 in 1937 , $10,112 , - 000 in 1938-39 , $9,605,000 in 1939-40 and $7,848,926 in the fiscal year ended June 80 , 1941 . Councilman Hart said : " That is $70,000,000 profit , or $70,000,000 more than it cost the to supply the commodity . What did you do with the $70,000 , - 000 profit ? " " It went into the city 's general t'unds , " Mr. Quilty replied . Councilman Carroll , chairman of general welfare committee , said the committee would prepare a report on water rate reductions this week for submission to the Council .
