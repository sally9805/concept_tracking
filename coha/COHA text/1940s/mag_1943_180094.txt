About a week out , the convoy steamed smoothly along the broad Atlantic seaway . Lookouts were on the alert . The ships were out of range of the landbased PBYs and Liberators which gave them anti-submarine protection on the first stage of their journey . Now they were on their own . <P> Late in the morning a plane came boring in from the horizon-single-engined , stubby-winged , deep-bellied where the depth bombs lay : a U.S. TBF Avenger . <P> This was something new to convoy crews , a single-engined land plane so far out to sea . It could mean only that a carrier was in the vicinity . But carrier escort , too , was unusual for an ordinary convoy . Hours later the crew spotted the answer : up over the horizon came a " baby flattop , " a carrier converted from a merchantman , escorted by several old four-stacker destroyers . By blinker light the little carrier reported : <P> " My operations for the last 24 hours : I have attacked Uncle-boats U-boats at following positions . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the navigator on one of the convoy vessels , " you ca n't help knowing you 're going to win the war when a thing like that comes up from nowhere and is on your side ! " <P> Little Ships . Escort carriers , converted or built from merchant hulls , do not carry many planes-a few fighters , and torpedo bombers which carry depth charges-but with those planes they can provide extensive cover for convoys beyond the range of land-based patrol planes . When the Allies announced the formation of an " air umbrella " which would provide air protection for convoys from continent to continent ( TIME , May 10 ) , escort carriers took over in that loneliest spot of the convoy lanes where the land-based planes turn back and leave the ships on their own . <P> Since their entry into the ocean battles they have been doing jobs far out of proportion to their size . Last week the Navy released the story of one of them , " Escort Carrier B. " <P> Big Deeds . " Escort Carrier B , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scored two sure kills , four " very probables " and four " probables . " Her planes allowed no enemy submarine to get closer than 18 miles to the convoy . Her casualties : one TBF damaged by 20-mm. ack-ack from a U-boat , its radio operator wounded . <P> The carrier 's first attack was made at dusk , when a TBF attacked a U-boat many miles off the convoy 's starboard bow . Depth bombs straddled the fully-surfaced submarine , but it sank with no trace of a definite kill . At dawn next day the planes took off again . Another sub was spotted and attacked . But there was no certain evidence of a kill . <P> Attacks 3 &; 4 came in quick succession , but the first definite kill did not come until sunset after the sixth attack . A TBF placed all its bombs right under the U-boat 's stern . It went down at once , then popped up , hopelessly out of control . Once more it sank at a steep angle , then resurfaced . The crew poured out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next engagement of the carrier lasted 14 hours , from dusk to daylight . Twice again the escort carrier 's planes struck . In the last attack four TBFs and two Wildcat fighters swooped in on the U-boat . The last of their depth bombs were direct hits on the deck ; only 17 crew members survived .
