With a rataplan and a paradiddle , U.S. radio last week opened its 1947-48 season . But it was no use for listeners to strain their ears hoping for something new . Nearly every one of the 80-odd new network shows would be an old one : <P> NBC , leading the field , has all of last season 's big-timers back , plus several of CBS 's choicest ( Take It or Leave It , Jimmy Durante , Your Hit Parade ) . Comedy will continue to be NBC 's long suit ( Bob Hope , Fred Allen , Amos ' n ' Andy ) . Glossiest and one of the most ballyhooed of the new NBC shows : the Kraft Music Hall , with Al Jolson and Oscar Levant . <P> CBS , having lost many of its top programs to other networks , got a few in return ( Mr. &; Mrs. North from NBC , Double or Nothing from Mutual , Lum ' n ' Abner from ABC ) . Headline repeaters : Dick Haymes , Baby Snooks , Lux Radio Theater . Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> ABC , most up &; coming of the networks , will be strongest on Wednesday nights , with Bing Crosby , Henry Morgan , Abbott &; Costello , Jack Paar . <P> Mutual , specialist in blood &; gore , will be sleuthing with Sherlock Holmes and Charlie Chan . Notable new programs : Information , Please ( from CBS ) , and Billy Rose , who will pitch his newspaper horseshoes at radio .
