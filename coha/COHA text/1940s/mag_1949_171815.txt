Last Sunday was set aside by American Catholics as a day of " prayer and protest " against the Communists ' trial of Cardinal Mindszenty . In Manhattan 's St. Patrick 's Cathedral , Francis Cardinal Spellman-who received his red hat with Mindszenty at the 1946 consistory-delivered a remarkable sermon : <P> " ' A new god has come to you , my people . His fiery eyes do not flash through clouds of incense or from altar candles . . . This new god is not a stone statue worn smooth by the kisses of the faithful-he was not born in heaven . . . The new god is born from earth and blood-he strides ahead , and under the thunder of his steps the globe trembles from East to West . This is the red god . The Seine shudders at his impact , and tries to break its banks . Westminster trembles before him like Jericho , and across the green ocean his red shadow falls on the walls of the White House . Hosanna ! New god . ' <P> " My dear friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words that echo the thoughts of men depraved and deranged-men who do not know truth , love , justice or faith . . . These lines . . . are taught to the youth of red-enshackled lands . . . where everybody is afraid of everybody else , where even a son fears his father and fathers fear their own blood-sons , as all become serfs and victims of the relentless god of Baal ! . . . They are wild words of warning , and , unless we listen well and realize that we must counteract them by concerted , constant prayer and action , then these words but foretell America 's and the whole world 's doom . <P> " May 8 , 1945-V-E day ! On that day I delivered from this pulpit a prayer of thanksgiving for the victory of the hour , begging peace with justice . . . The peace that came was not God 's peace ; and because in the ensuing postwar years men 's hearts have not been won back to God , I must this day-as a protest against the crucifixion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cardinal Mindszenty . . . " <P> It Is Full Time . . . " From the very hour he was taken away in the black of night from his home , his flock , his aged mother , Cardinal Mindszenty became the victim of torturings and druggings that put him beyond the reach or realm of human help . It was he himself who said to me , when he was the honored guest here less than two years ago , ' My enemies can take from me no more than my life , and that has already been given to God . ' <P> " No , the physical Cardinal Mindszenty can no longer be saved . It is the spiritual Cardinal Mindszenty in his martyrdom of mind and body that we can fortify by our prayers , that in his soul he may know that in another part of the world other men are holding high God 's torch of justice . . . And in our own dear land each free man ... must protect and fight to keep his own integrity of conscience , his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the democratic , God-loving world from trickery , torturings , disasters and defeat . . . <P> " I shall never cease to pray and labor to protect America , and warn and work against Communism and all the evils growing from out its rotted roots , for I believe that ' rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God .
