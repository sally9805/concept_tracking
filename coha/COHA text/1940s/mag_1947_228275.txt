Out of the composing room of the strikebound Philadelphia Record stalked a squad of grim-faced A.F.L. printers . They marched across the street to Rosen 's saloon , a hangout for Record workers . In the bar , they walked up to a group of strikers , tossed them the proofs of a statement that was running on Page One . Said one bitter printer : " Well , you guys have finally managed to close the paper . " <P> The thunderstruck strikers , members of the C.I.O. Newspaper Guild , hurried outside . Sure enough , their picket line had melted away . There was no longer a Philadelphia Record for them to picket . Tired of a fight that nobody seemed able to win , impulsive , New Dealing Publisher J. David Stern had shut up shop and sold out . The buyer : conservative Robert McLean , head of the rich Evening Bulletin and president of the Associated Press . <P> The Guild had singled out Dave Stern for a knockdown , drag-out fight . As a self-proclaimed friend of labor , Stern might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other press lords . The Guild had made identical demands ( including $100 a week for experienced newsmen ) on Walter Annenberg , head of the Inquirer . Annenberg , like Stern , had turned them down-but the Guild let Annenberg alone , and struck Stern 's Record , and his Camden Courier and Post , across the Delaware River . <P> Fair Warning . Much to their surprise , Stern fought back hard . A handful of executives managed to get out the paper without the 580 strikers . The Stern papers never missed an edition . Stern sent the Guild a warning : " I want to be fair , " he wrote , " but I will not be coerced . If this business can not be operated on a reasonable basis of give- &-take,; then it is not worth operating . " The Guild backed down from $100 to $88 in its demands , and Stern upped his offer from $68 to $75 . That was as close as they got . <P> Last week , after 87 days of being picketed , Stern wrote a front-page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to restrict the rights of management to a degree where it has become too great a burden to operate a completely independent press . . . . Philadelphia 's liberal newspaper has been chosen by this one union as a target for its unusual theories . " <P> Lost Voice . In going out of business , Dave Stern left the third largest city in the U.S. , which once had 16 newspapers , with only two major dailies-and only one editorial viewpoint . With the crusading Record , conservative Publisher McLean got powerful ( 50,000 watts ) Radio Station WCAU and the Camden papers . McLean intended to keep the radio station going and incorporate the Record 's Sunday features ( among them the American Weekly ) in a Sunday edition for the Bulletin . The profitable Camden papers and the weekday Record , which he did not want , he could sell at his leisure . Meanwhile his Bulletin could not absorb many of Stern 's 1,675 employees .
