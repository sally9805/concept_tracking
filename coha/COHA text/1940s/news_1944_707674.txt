The British scheme , authored by Lord John Maynard Keynes , lays less emphasis on the use of gold as a backing for a stabilization fund to be used in this work than does the , of the American plan prepared by Harry D , White lor the Treasury . Geld Standard 's History History of the gold standard traces back to 1816. in England . For some six centuries before that Britain had toyed with silver and gold , in various combinations , as a backing for her currency . The United States , which long had followed Britain 's ear* , came to a full gold standard in 1900 . Word War 1 , however , led to the temporary abandonment of the gold standard as it had been known where it not only backed the currency of a country but that currency was convertible into gold coin . People who wanted gold could get it . That was an invitation to boarding and when countries fell on bad times they had to discourage this hoarding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drain of their heavy import balances . Since World War 1 most countries hwe used one of two varieties of monetary standards : 1 . A gold bullion standard , in which gold bars ( not coins I are available in large amounts in exchange for currency . In some countries , such as England between December . 1925 and September . 1931 , the smallest amount obtainable was 400 ounces ( about 514,000 worth at the present price i . For all practical purposes this made it impossible for the average individual to hold gold . The United States . under the Gold Reserve Act of 1934. went onto what might be called the international gold bullion standard : gold bars are available only for export purposes . 2 A gold exchange standard Countries which felt they could n't operate on a gold bullion standard often adopted this substitute . What they did was to keep their currencies at a parity with gold in other countries by redeeming domestic currency in dollars , sterling . or some other currency that could be turned Into gold For A True Gold Standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The government , as the currency authority . must buy at a fixed price and coin all gold brought to it , it must also sell at the same price all gold demanded of It World gold mining received its greatest impetus in recent history on January 31 , 1934 when the United States set a price of $35 an ounce on gold . Production jumped from 2:1.5 million ounces in 193.3 to 40 9 million in 1941 . American output more than doubled during this period and gold reserves of the United States soared nearly ten-fold . Approximately three-fourths of the world 's gold output is in the ' hands of the British Empire and the United States . Production has declined sharply during the war , falling to an estimated less than $800 million last year . compared with a peak of 31,297 million in 1940 . This is due largely to diversion of manpower to more important work .
