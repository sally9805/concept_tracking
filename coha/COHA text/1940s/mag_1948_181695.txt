The neighbors , who used to watch dapper little James ( " Occo " ) Tamer mowing his front lawn , did n't suspect that he was an ex-gunman and bank robber . The Detroit police knew . What 's more , they had a pretty good idea that velvet-voiced little Jimmy ( out of prison on parole ) was Detroit 's public enemy No.1-resident boss of the city 's dope smugglers , policy operators , syndicate thieves ( specializing in furs and jewelry ) and bookmaking ring . He was n't the kind of man who could do it all on his own : he was , the police were convinced , Racket King Frank Costello 's man-in-charge in Detroit . The police tapped Tamer 's telephone wires and settled back expectantly . <P> Over the phone one day last month came a call from a player on the Boston Bruins pro hockey team . Asked Tamer : " How are things going ? " The player : " Do n't worry about the game tonight . One of the players is sick and another 's baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be the only one able to play well and I do n't intend to do so good . Do n't worry . Bet $500 for me . " <P> The Calls Went East . As soon as the player hung up , Tamer was on the phone to New York . The Detroit police noted that many of his long-distance " information " calls went east ; presumably he was relaying the dope to Boss Costello , whose office sets the national odds on pro hockey games. * <P> A few days later , Tamer was arrested in a downtown Detroit bar , and the story broke . Detroit police dropped hints that Tamer had " made contact " with players on other teams in the league . And it was no secret that gamblers congregated near the entrance of the Detroit rink before hockey games to hawk bets . There were lots of gamblers at other big-league hockey arenas , too , particularly at Toronto 's Maple Leaf Gardens . <P> No Fixes . Clarence Campbell , president of the National Hockey League , hurried to Detroit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of black eye that the Black Sox Scandal had given baseball in 1919 . Greying Clarence Campbell , a Rhodes scholar and ex-hockey referee , went into conference with Michigan 's Governor Kim Sigler , bustled vigorously about Detroit for a few days , then announced triumphantly : " Nobody fixed anything anywhere . " <P> But last week , he expelled a New York Ranger hockey player-Billy ( " The Kid " ) Taylor-from professional hockey for life . The charge : making a wager on a hockey game , which is an infraction of the rules . Campbell also suspended a Boston Bruins player-Don Gallinger-for associating with people like Parole Violator Jimmy Tamer , who would n't be mowing his lawn again for some time to come . <P> <P> *The big Minneapolis syndicate which has long set the nation 's odds on college basketball and football games stopped quoting prices and accepting bets on pro hockey games ( and prizefights ) about two years ago .
