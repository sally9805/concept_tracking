Since science can now distinguish the incurably sick from the curable , mercy killing is justified-so goes the chatter in cocktail bars . The naked , woolly-haired Nuba tribesmen who live in the Otoro Hills , deep in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan , did not wait for the cocktail-bar moralists ; the Nuba have been euthanasians since way back . Once they are sure that a tribesman is possessed of a djinn ( evil spirit ) , they bump him off . Everybody ( in the Otoros ) , of course , is quite certain that djinns inhabit the bodies of the lame , the deaf and the dumb . <P> A djinn-infested Nuba is marched out of his village in a procession headed by a goat wearing a big brass bell . Victim and goat are buried alive . When the bell stops ringing , the tribesmen know that the goat and the man are dead , and the djinn is banished . Recently explorers in the Otoros came across the graves of two crippled children and a deaf- &-dumb; woman . Last week police arrested 22 tribesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety practiced by the Nazis , was not entirely consistent . Arrested as a ringleader of the mercy killers was a blind man . Apparently , his djinn knew a ward leader or a geneticist.
