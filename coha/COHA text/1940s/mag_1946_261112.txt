I went to the animal fair <P> The birds and beasts were there . <P> The big baboon by the light of the moon <P> Was combing his auburn hair . <P> Before the war . New Yorkers found such an animal fair in the smelly old Bowery warehouse of Louis Ruhe , Inc. ( pronounced Looie Rooie ) , world 's largest wild-animal dealer . The fair was at its best in March . Then U.S. zoo keepers , searching for animals for the spring and summer zoogoers , would stalk lions and tigers , aardvarks and aye-ayes , capybaras and caimans , tarsiers and toucans , caged in Ruhe 's warehouse . <P> Ruhe 's $3,000,000-a-year business , founded in Germany in 1830 , sickened during the war . But Heinz Ruhe , great grandson of the founder , kept the business going by bringing in small South American animals and birds , including quetzals , almost worth their weight in gold ( $500 apiece ) . Other animal dealers imported " essential " monkeys for laboratory use . ( The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a head . ) <P> Away from Monkey Business . Last week the hunt for animals was again in full cry . U.S. zoos had lost an estimated 25 to 30% of their animals and birds during the war , now would spend millions to replace them . Heinz Rube 's first postwar shipment was on its way to New York from Calcutta . His closest competitor , Henry Trefflich , whose warehouse was not far away , had landed his first shipment of 66 demoiselle cranes , worth about $200 a pair . <P> All over the world , agents of U.S. animal dealers were scouting bazaars and native villages . Some were taking their own expeditions into the jungles , but for the most part natives do the often dangerous job of trapping the animals . <P> Ruhe alone had six agents abroad ( he had 20 before the war ) . They were looking for anything they could get at a reasonable price . Most of all they wanted to buy the okapi , a purplish-brown , short-necked relative of the giraffe , worth $10,000 to $15,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bongo , sometimes priced as high as $20,000 . There is only one of each now in this country both in New York 's Bronx Zoo . The Indian rhinoceros* and giant panda were in the same diamond and sable class . Less valuable were Siberian tigers ( about $8,000 ) gorillas ( $3,000-$5,000 ) , hippos ( $3.000-$4,000 ) and pygmy elephants . Occasionally , baby elephants have been jobbed off as rare , high-priced pygmies . Cheapest animal of all is the king of beasts . Reason : lions and tigers breed so well in captivity that zoos sell them to each other for as little as $100 . <P> Wanted : Hen 's Teeth . But bargains in wild animals were as scarce as hen 's teeth . War and inflation had shot animal prices sky high . In Burma , the war had killed off many elephants . The remainder were being used for reconstruction . In India , wealthy anti-British natives had been investing in elephants rather than war bonds , had driven elephant prices up to $2,250 . Expenses of transportation and the 15% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealer up to $5,000 in New York . Prewar price to zoos : $2,000 to $3,000 , f.o.b . New York .
