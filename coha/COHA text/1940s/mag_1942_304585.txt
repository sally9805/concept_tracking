Henry J. Kaiser , the big , bald miracle man from the West Coast , will get a chance to build his cargo planes . In his bulging brief case this week was a written promise from WPBoss Donald Nelson , authorizing him to go ahead- to make 100 of his projected 70-ton transports- provided he could show that he could build them without taking materials away from the aircraft industry . He had Nelson 's promise to make the number 500 as soon as the program proved practicable . And he had another , bigger promise : eventually he would get a crack at building fabulous 200-tons flying boats , capable of carrying 50 tons of freight to any corner of the world . <P> Thus Kaiser emerged from his nine-day whirlwind tour of Washington with a signal victory , gained only after bitterest battle with all the it-can't-be-done experts ( TIME , Aug. 10 ) . He had to convince Nelson , Nelson 's advisers , two Senate committees ; he had to beat down the Army &; Navy , which still do not see where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the pressure of an enthusiastic public opinion . <P> At a private luncheon at the Army and Navy Club , blunt Henry Kaiser outshouted Airt Chief Henry ( " Hap " ) Arnold and tough Lieut . General Brehon Somervell , chief of the Services of Supply , when they challenged his ability to produce . He had found an unexpected ally in ubiquitous Harold Ickes , who suggested that the Bureau to Mines might help find some untapped mineral resources . Then Donald Nelson , acting tougher than Washington had ever seen him , took Kaiser 's proposal to the White House , convinced Frankling Roosevelt in one session that the man who had shown shipbuilders how to build ships should be allowed a flyer at plane making . <P> Finally Donald Nelson called him in , said : " Henry , I 'm going to take another chance on you . " Henry Kaiser , no whit tired by his campaign , got to work . <P> From his new Washington office near the Mayflower Hotel he issued orders and directives . He put out feelers for precious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got assurance-from somewhere-that engines would be forthcoming for at least his first 100 planes . <P> Where the planes would be built was still a secret . Kaiser had talked of devoting nine shipyards to construction of 5,000 planes . He could start the first 100 at one of his Pacific Coast yards , where great fabricating and assembly shops could be converted to plane building and the huge cranes used for shipbuilding are big enough to lift even giant planes like the Mars . <P> While Henry Kaiser was in Washington arguing for permission to build planes , his able son Edgar , in charge of the three Kaiser yards at Portland , Ore. , was busy making plans for converting the yards and figuring how the planes could be built . Accustomed to many makeshifts , he figured on buying little machinery , making tools on hand do as much as possible . <P> Father Kaiser promised the first of his transports within ten months . Skeptics are sure it will take longer . But the freighters that can not be sunk by subs will be welcome whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that the Army itself had converted 21% of big bomber production to freighters : " Right now we need cargo planes badly , and two years from now we will still be needing them .
