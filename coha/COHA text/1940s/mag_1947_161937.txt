As every American boy within earshot of a radio knows , Cowboy Tom Mix's* wondrous compass-magnifying glass may be obtained for only 15 and one Shredded Ralston box top . The same price plus one box top of General Mills ' Kix will bring the " awe-inspiring " atomic-bomb ring with its " concealed observation lens . " <P> Such frenzied advertising flashes , emitted largely by the radio and Sunday newspaper comic section ads , have heralded the postwar return of " premiums , " the somewhat mysterious business in which everything from atomic rings to nylon stockings can be bought at cut prices with the proper number of box tops , soap wrappers , etc . Ever since 1851 , when Benjamin Talbot Babbitt , the father of packaged soap , got the idea of offering sentimental chromos for 25 Babbitt 's Best Soap wrappers , premiums have helped sell thousands of items . <P> By 1941 , some $450,000,000 in merchandise was " given away " as premiums every year . The business accounted for as much as 30% of all U.S. china manufacture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispensers bought wholesale and marked up prices only enough to cover costs , thrifty housewives found that they usually got bargains . The war temporarily cut off premiums ; there was no need for them in the seller 's market . As the buyer 's market has come back , so have premiums . By last week , 8,000 companies were hawking them and the premium business is expected to hit $1 billion this year , including the comparatively small part made up of knickknacks . <P> Keep a Secret . The ruling house of the knickknack premiums is the Robbins Co. of Attleboro , Mass . It manufactures its marvels inside a 50-year-old , grey frame building , ships them out in boxes labeled with descriptions vague enough to baffle spies presumed to be alert for any new top-secret Robbins item . <P> Well they might be . Robbins not only makes the atomic ring ( see cut ) and the Mix compass , but it turns out some dozen similar gadgets ( the Orphan Annie dog whistle , Captain Midnight 's code ring , a compass ring for Shredded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) for the major users of box-top premiums . Latest to come off the top-secret list : a " weather ring " for B. F. Goodrich . ( A tiny sheet of litmus paper beneath a plastic lens turns pink in rainy weather , blue in fair . ) <P> By making them in quantity ( the atomic ring has already sold over 3,000,000 ) , Robbins can sell them to companies for around 10 . The 15 the companies get usually covers all their premium costs , making the " self-liquidating " premium a salesman who works for nothing . <P> The boss of Robbins is breezy , grey-haired Theodore Leavens , 46 , who has thought up some of Robbins ' best knickknacks . One item was inspired by a memory of his Montana boyhood near a mine with ore too poor to mine . Leavens put out a ring with a chunk of " real gold " ore set in it .
