He kept his eyes turned away from Browder , his former " comrade , " who leaned back in his chair , // EX-RED SPY HEARD AT BROWDER TRIAL // held his hand to his face and gazed disdainfully at the witness from beneath furrowed brows . Browder 's lips were a tight , unsmiling line under his close-cut mustache , which , with his slicked down hair and his intent expression gave him a slightly Hitleresque look . Questioned by Robert L. Werner , an assistant district attorney , Dozenberg identified his signature on his application for naturalization after he came to this country in 1904 from Riga , then in Russia , now in Latvia , where he was born on Sept. 3 , 1882 . Between 1904 and 1921 , he said , he lived in Boston and New York . He was naturalized in 1911 in Boston , where he said he once practiced the trade of machinist .

He added that he could not find his naturalization papers when he looked for them in 1924 , but was not allowed to say whether he had discussed their loss with his wife , Judge Alfred C. Coxe sustained an objection on this point by George Gordon Battle , trial counsel for Browder , which stopped the prosecution from trying to trace the papers from Dozenberg to Browder . His wife 's name appeared as identifying witness in the 1921 passport application . On cross-examination Mr. Battle asked only a few questions to bring out that Dozenberg was to have been sentenced day before yesterday on his passport charge , but sentence was postponed . Mr. Werner then asked the witness whether he had received any ' promises of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or threats if he did not . " No , " said Dozenberg .

Bell , executive assistant to the chief of the passport division , testified that when Browder obtained a renewel of his 1934 passport in 1937 he said he was traveling on business as a journalist . He asked permission to visit Spain as well as Russia , France and Switzerland , but at that time all American passports were stamped " not valid in Spain " because of the Spanish civil war . An exception was made to let Browder visit Spain under protection of the United States Government , Mr. Bell went on , after C. A.
