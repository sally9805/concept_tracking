Hitler 's U-boat fleet was about done . While U.S. troops pounded at the gates of Brest , Lorient and St. Nazaire , the three greatest Atlantic bases of the Unterseeboote , President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill proclaimed the destruction of 500 of the sea serpents in four years and eleven months of World War II . <P> In four years and three months of World War I , less than 200 had been sent to the bottom . That tally was beaten in 1943 alone . <P> For Grand Admiral Karl Doenitz , it was a time of anguish . He must get the 1st and 9th Submarine Flotillas away from Brest , the 2nd and 10th from Lorient , the 6th and 7th from St. Nazaire . But where could he send them ? The only other Biscay bases were La Pallice and Bordeaux , each with facilities for only one flotilla , which already crowded the pens . Farther north were Bergen and Trondheim , with berths for a single flotilla apiece . But the Allied navies patrolled the Atlantic looking for U-boats on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , closed at Gibraltar . <P> The Hunter Hunted . In June , the Nazis claimed to have sunk 312,000 tons of Allied shipping-a far cry from the mad March days of 1942 and 1943 , when they claimed 900,000 or more . But even this relatively modest claim was a thousand percent exaggeration . In other words , sinkings actually were under 30,000 tons . <P> In recent months the number of U-boats sunk by Allied air and sea patrols has exceeded the number of the U-boats ' victims .
