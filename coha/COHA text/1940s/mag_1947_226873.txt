In landlocked Paraguay , Dictator-President Higinio Mornigo could hardly be blamed for overlooking Admiral Mahan 's classic studies of the influence of sea power on history . There was less excuse for his forgetting the Clausewitz command to land fighters to concentrate the main force on the main enemy . Because he ignored both teachers , Mornigo last week was in a tough spot . <P> Throughout Paraguay 's five months ' civil war , the rebel base had been Concepcion , 130 miles up the Paraguay River from Mornigo 's capital , Asuncin . Because the Dictator lacked the ships , he was unable to attack the rebels by the river route . Slowly his ill-equipped troops plodded across country . Just short of Concepcin they were blocked by the Ypan River barrier , and not until last month did they sweep into Concepcion . Mornigo cried that the war was as good as over . In shabby Asuncin , factory whistles shrilled salutes to victory . <P> But the Government troops had captured only an evacuated base . The main force of the rebels had escaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to river barges and tugs , transferred the " Voice of Victory " radio station to the paddle-wheel steamer Itzuaingo and headed down , the Paraguay River in company with the armored gunboats Paraguay and Humait . <P> At week 's end the rebels were close to Asuncin , and its garrison of raggle-taggle troops that Mornigo hopefully dubbed the " Second Army Corps . " His best force was still near Concepcin . The rebels called for Asuncin 's surrender . Mornigo retorted that the rebels would be squeezed to death between his two armies , ordered the capital to remain calm . Foreign diplomats did not take him seriously . A vanguard had already moved across the border to safety in Argentina . <P> In Rio , Francisco Negrao de Lima , the Brazilian diplomat who had tried unsuccessfully to mediate between Mornigo and the rebels , gave the Dictator only a few more days . Said he : " The end seems close . "
