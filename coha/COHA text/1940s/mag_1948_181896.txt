Fantastic was Hollywood 's word for it . A 34-year-old ex-film cutter and a 37-year-old ex-pressagent , with a total capital of $25,000 , brashly announced last year that they were going to make a million-dollar A movie . <P> Last week , when their tiny Screen Plays , Inc. released its million-dollar movie , So This Is New York , Hollywood had another word for it : luck . It was that - and considerably more . <P> Here Comes Morgan . In May 1947 , taciturn , brilliant Stanley Kramer , who had almost made it as a movie producer when war came , and squat , shrewd George Glass , known as " an honest pressagent , " took options on 30 of the late Ring Lardner 's stories . They picked The Big Town for their first picture , changed the title and went looking for a star to fit the script . What comedian could handle Lardner 's light touch without seeming all thumbs ? Screen Plays eyed radio 's Henry Morgan . After reading the story and a 100-page " treatment , " Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brains to imagine that I might be interested in what kind of a movie I 'm in . I 'll do it . " <P> By now , Screen Plays ' tiny poke had already shrunk to a mere $7,000 . It was high time to go to the bank . Negotiations began with a bang . " Who , " asked the Bank of America , " are you ? And who is Henry Morgan ? " After some fast talking , the bank was persuaded to lend $650,000 . That left about $500,000 still to be found . Screen Plays wrote off about half of it in deferred salaries and studio overhead charges , sold a 50% interest in the picture to raise the rest ( including $150,000 to be put up as additional security for the bank ) . United Artists agreed to release the film and everything looked fine . <P> There Goes the Bankroll . But in July , the backers backed out . David Loew , bigwig in Enterprise Productions , agreed to put up some money on stiff conditions : 50% of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film . Reluctantly Kramer and Glass agreed . A shooting date was set . <P> Then , in August , Great Britain slapped the 75% ad valorem tax on all U.S. films . The Loew-supported bottom fell out of Screen Plays , Inc . That night , trying to drown their sorrows in gin , the partners succeeded in refloating their enterprise on a tipsy wave of optimism . In four days of desperate rewriting , Screen Plays , Inc. shelled $339,000 off the picture 's " nut , " without sacrificing the essentials of the story . Loew agreed to stay in . In September , So This Is New York finally went into production-and came out $30,000 under the final budget . Even silent Stan Kramer got off a bon mot : " Now we can put our ulcers in escrow . " <P> At four sneak previews , audiences liked what they saw . Cracked Glass : " We are now solidly in a position to finance another million-dollar picture , but we have n't got a nickel for a cigar . " <P> So This Is New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worth its birth pangs . Though not as funny as Lardner 's original , it is still a nice little farce-comedy of contrasting manners .
