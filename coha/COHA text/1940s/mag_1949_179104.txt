The small , bald , bespectacled man in the brown suit , who was freed on a technicality in London last week , looked like a Hearst cartoon of a New Deal scholar . He was no such thing : he was Gerhart Eisler , <P> German national , onetime resident of Sunnyside , L.I. , onetime Communist ringmaster in the U.S. , who had been jailed in Britain since he was carried , kicking and screaming like a child in a tantrum , from the Polish motor-ship Batory , bound for Gdynia ( TIME , May 23 ) . <P> Eisler had been convicted in Washington in 1947 for swearing to false statements on a passport application . He had appealed from this verdict and was awaiting a Supreme Court decision when he jumped his $23,500 bail and boarded the Batory . The U.S. , in asking Britain to extradite him , said that Eisler had been convicted of perjury , a crime specifically covered in the Anglo-U.S . Treaty of Extradition . Eisler 's British lawyer contended that the treaty did not cover Eisler 's conviction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless it is taken in connection with a judicial proceeding . After a two-hour courtroom argument , softspoken , gentlemanly Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Sir Laurence Dunne agreed , and turned the little man loose . <P> Roundly cheered by a mob of Communists and fellow travelers in London , Gerhart Eisler said he would proceed to the Russian zone of Germany and take a teaching post at Leipzig . Although jubilant , the little man seemed somewhat puzzled by his release . In his Red dream world , the British court which ruled on his case should have functioned as a docile tool of U.S. imperialist terror . Said Eisler , whimsically : " I ai n't no mastermind , but I 'm an average good Communist . I try to be a better Communist every day . "
