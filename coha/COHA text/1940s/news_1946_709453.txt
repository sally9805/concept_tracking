txt With tracer bullets illuminating the night sky , Alcatraz Penitentiary guards and police reinforcements were engaged in a pitched battle with barricaded desperadoes on " The Rock " late tonight , many hours after a group of convicts , holding prison officials as hostages , had attempted to shoot their way to liberty . At least one guard was killed ( and a few were wounded , with convict casualties unknown , while the gun fight showed no immediate sign of abating . A detachment of marines had landed on the island , in San Francisco Bay , to give aid to Warden James A. Johnston 's embattled force , and Coast Guard boats and planes encircled and patrolled " The Rock " to cut off any escape . The first fatality of the engagement , which began in mid-after- , noon and looked to observers like a cross between a Hollywoodstaged melodrama and real war , was H. P. Stites , a guard . Six other guards were wounded . One of them , Harry Cochrane , thought there were many casualties , " but none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As heavy clouds of smoke poured out the windows of the cell block late tonight , apparently from a fire started by tracer bullets from guards ' guns and by incendiary flares , a version of how the break started gained wide credence . A " tough guy " identified only as " Coy , " according to reports from several quarters , overpowered a guard in the north tower and took his submachine gun away from him . This guard was believed to be Stites , whose body was drilled by machine-gun bullets . One source said that the assailant was a Kentucky bank robber , doing a twenty-six-year term . " Too tough " for the Atlanta penitentiary , according to this source , he was sent to Alcatraz . At gunpoint , this version went on , the convict drove his captive to the guards ' room , where he stuck up eight or ten guards preparing to go on duty . Then , it was related , he picked up all the guns he could carry and , driving the guards ahead of him , went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cells . " Come on boys , let 's go , " he was quoted as saying . Twelve convicts , it was said , rushed to join him , armed themselves and the big battle was on . Battling Goes On Into Night Thousands of rounds of ammunition were fired and Coast Guardsmen shuttling between island and mainland late into the night report the battle " still out of control . " " All the convicts in the cell block are armed , " said a crew member of the prison launch . After an attempt to storm a gun gallery held by the convicts had been repulsed , there was a short lull , but later the police boat D. A. White , patrolling the island , reported the firing as still " heavy and continuous . " The prisoners not engaged in the fight were moved from the work area and shops to the yard , where armed marines were assigned to guard them . First word that something was wrong on " hTe Rock , " long publicized as " escape-proof " Federal penitentiary , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern daylight time ) when motori crossing the San Francisco-Oakland Bay bridge heard shooting and sirens on Alcatraz Island . More than six hours later picked marksmen called from the San Francisco Police Department , and a group of prison guards , were still trying to subdue the fortified convicts as residents of San Francisco 's hills and observers in Navy and Coast Guard patrol boats watched the progress of the battle through glasses . The center of action was the main cell house , with the convicts barricading themselves in the middle tier of the three-tier block . Guards poured bullets and tear gas into the windows , but the desperadoes picked up the tear gas bombs before they could explode and hurled them back through the broken windows . The bombs , exploding outside the building , set fire to shrubbery and grass . One reporter , who had seen service in the European theatre as an army officer , was reminded of his war experience as he watched what he described as " a hell of a battle " being fought in clouds of smoke . Machine Gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' P. M. had telegraphed to the mainland that a convict had obtained a machine gun and imprisoned " most " of the island 's officers in the cell house , sent further word hours afterward that " our situation is difficult and precarious . " " Our officers are all being used in every place that we can man , " he said . " The armed prisoners on the island are still eluding us so that at the moment we can not control them . The Navy , Coast Guard , and San Francisco Police Department are standing by tol help when we find we can use them to advantage . " A reporter , watching the battle through field glasses as he circled the island in a patrol boat , said that the rattle of a machine gun could be heard as well as some rifle and pistol fire from the building . At 4:30 P. M. , more than an hour after the first word from Warden Johnston , the prison seemed quiet , with no guards in the gun towers but with cell block windows patched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battle a quarter of an hour later . New Tactics in Resume-1 Attack " A half-dozen guards up the slanting road beside th. . enitentiary 's ice plant , " the reporter on the boat related . " They stood up in plain sight and poured a roaring blast of gunfire into the windows of the southern side . " Two other guards ran down a catwalk on the west side , eight feet below the windows of the second tier , and , raising on tiptoe , fired pistols directly into the windows . At the end of the walk they ran across an exposed position , dropping every few feet to the cement . " They fired pistols again into the windows and then ran back to ' cement wall cover . " At first the guards had fired at long distance , but the convicts had a big advantage in position and sent such a heavy barrage from the cell block that their attackers had to change tactics .

In response to an appeal from the warden , the San Francisco Police Department sent a group of sharpshooters to the island in a police boat , which carried an arsenal of machine guns , rifles and tear gas . The Coast Guard sent five patrol boats armed with submachine guns to the area and the Navy dispatched two patrol craft similarly armed , while a Coast Guard plane circled over the island . Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , notified earlier in the . afternoon by prison officials that " a possible attempt to escape had been made , " went to the island in the Bay and the Army stood by ready to rush troops to the scene if Warden Johnston asked for further assistance . The first direct word from the warden came in this telegram : " Serious trouble . Convict has machine gun in cell house . Have issued riot call . Placed armed guards at strategic locations . Most of our officers are imprisoned in cellhouse . Can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of damage done . Will give you more information later in the day when we get control .

" Alcatraz houses some of the country 's most dangerous criminals and has been called " escapeproof , " although a few years ago two convicts disappeared into a fog and were never seen again . Prison attaches believed that they drowned . Call House " Escape-Proof " Law enforcement officers who have been at Alcatraz said that even though the rebellious prisoners might have gained control of the cell house today , they could not get out . One officer explained the situation thus : " To come out of the main cell house and get into the open air you have to approach a gate , or door , of steel , with a steel plate over the keyhole . You ca n't put a key in the lock even if you have one , unless the armorer who is outside in a cage is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Alcatraz had at least 100 officers , of whom thirty to forty were on duty at one time . The warden 's message to the Navy was in the form of an emergency telephone call to Captain H. P. Burnett of the Twelfth Naval District . It urged that Navy patrol vessels be sent into the bay to " ring the island " to prevent escapes . The city police detail , headed by Sergeant Emil Dubill , which hurried to the island , had been practicing at the police range when the summons reached the marksmen .
