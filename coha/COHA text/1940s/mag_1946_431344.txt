 | All my life I have heard women , and a good many men , talk about what they call woman 's instinct , as if it were some kind of magic insight into characters and situations that only women can have . My impression is that in the past few years there has been less talk about this than there used to be . But only the other evening I ran into a husband and wife who seemed to believe in " woman 's intuition , " as they called it , as if it were as dependable as the multiplication table . Their faith went back to an experience they had had : an experience I have been told about again and again by similar believers in this mysterious instinct . Once , that is , the , husband in the case had been inclined to go into partnership with a man whom the wife , for no articulate reason , had distrusted instinctively . The wife 's instinct had prevailed over the husband 's judgment , and the other man had turned out later to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no doubt that her instinct was their best guide , and the husband agreed with her . I did not agree with her , in general , but I had no chance to get a word in , let alone the last word . So here I take advantage of my trade and carry the subject into print . For I do not believe that women have any magic instinct that men lack , or that women are essentially different from men in the methods by which they make up their minds and act on ' their decisions . Women may say that they act on instinct , and men that they rely on judgment , but the judgment and the instinct are not separate matters . They often are so closely involved that they seem one process , and that process gets called by the dramatic name instinct rather than by the less showy name judgment , or knowledge . Every day all of us , men and women , do things that call for kinds of knowledge we do not even know we have . For instance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without @#  | conscious thought decide to go ahead or to wait for an approaching automobile to pass . Our decision calls for several cal:illations we probably could not make n mathematical terms . We estimate the speed of the vehicle and the time it will take to reach a certain point in the street , and we estimate the time it will take us , walking , to reach the same point . We take into account , still without think:ng much , the condition of the pavement and the apparent skill or care of the driver . That is , if the pavement is slippery with oil or water , or if the driver is weaving from side to side , we decide against taking an unnecessary risk . Or we may be cautious because we are tired or lame or otherwise infirm , and do not trust ourselves . A whole set of calculations flashes through our minds , more swiftly than deliberate thought , before we start across the street in the cheerful confidence that we shall not collide with that heavy body moving at that high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is heavy and fast enough to kill us if it should hit ca. and we do not feel particularly reekkiss when we pass in front of it or let it peso in front of us . We may call this merely an instinct , but it is not something that was born with us . It has been acquired , as a result of observation and calculation . Small children do not have it , and unless they are watched closely they will dart into traffic adults would know to be dangerous . Old persons who do not see or hear well , or who have lost the power of quick and urate calculation , run the same risk children . Such instinct does not save unless it is grounded in experience we lave had and have not yet forgotten . TAKE another instance . We go into a room in which two people are evidently angry at each other , though we havee not heard them quarreling and through they make every effort to keep us from seeing that there is trouble between them . As we ordinarily express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or aversion . Yet some persons , thus happening in to a touchy situation , may be so obtuse as to miss it altogether , and others so subtle that they can not be fooled by the most prompt and skillful recovery on the part of the actors in the interrupted scene . The difference lies not in the degree of instinct but in the amount and quality of perception . Eyes alert enough will see signs of anger in flushed cheeks , stiff movements , unnatural self-consciousness . Ears alert enough will hear voices a little thick or rough or uncertain how to pretend to be easy . These perceptions come through our senses , which have perceived the symptoms of anger before . A child may feel such a situation enough to be terrified by it , but only if he already has suffered from the anger of his elders . So far as I can find out , this is all there is to women 's reputation for superior instinct . The special training most women go through has made them attentive to things many men do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other way round . I remember an incident when I was in my twenties and visiting in a house where there was a girl in her teens . While her brother and I were talking one day in the library , she came in hunting for a book . Though the brother and I did not stop talking , I noticed that  | she picked up a certain volume and put it down , obviously , disappointed . I at once stood up and got her the book she wanted . She was overwhelmed , but there was no mystery about it . I knew little of her taste in reading , but I did know books ; and I had noticed that the library had two books , and only two , in a certain uniform series I was interested in . Since the book she picked up was one of these and it was plainly not the one she wanted , the other had to be . As I was a candid young man and explained away the mystery , I got nothing but the credit , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps she might quite as reasonably have guessed some wish of mine , but refused to tell how , and I might have thought this an evidence of woman 's instinct . Perhaps then , but not now . I never have heard of women 's doing wonders in science or art or politics or business by their woman 's instinct . In such affairs they have to think and work the same as men . Their triumphs of instinct are in personal relationships . And here most women have been busy since babyhood observing , estimating , calculating , deciding . They study how to please as men seldom do , and they watch with intense vigilance for symptoms of hostility or neglect , indecisiveness or shiftiness . That woman who warned her husband against the unsafe partner , whether or not she was fully aware of it , was already an observant and experienced judge of what might threaten her ; and she was making quick calculations as involved , though not so mathematical , as if she had been making up her mind to cross the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband and had better judgment . When men 's and women 's interests are the same , their so-called instincts are the same ; too , with only individual variations . When men and women have different major interests , their instinctive actions are different , too ; but the differences rise from the nature of the subjects , not from the nature of the sexes . Man 's instinct is every bit as good as woman 's when they deal with similar issues . A woman who lays claim to some special woman 's instinct is either self-deluded or pretending . A man who concedes superiority to her merely because she is a woman deserves the inferior status he has doltishly accepted .
