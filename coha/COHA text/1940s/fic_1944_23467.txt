Born in Shanghai and educated in China , the United States , and England , John J. Espey is a member of the English department at Occidental College in Los Angeles . THE LADY BANDIT JOHN ESPEY R. LOGAN PEARSALL SMITH has given us in Unforgatten Years a lively account of his passage through the state of Justification and his attainment of Sanctification at the age of seven , a conquest of Satan and a gain of Grace which were instrumental in converting thousands of Red Indians . Had I , during my childhood in the Presbyterian Mission outside the Old South Gate of the native city of Shanghai , been the first cause of any similar movement , no matter how modest in comparison with Mr. Smith 's , I should certainly exploit it to the limit of my talents . Humbly I confess that I was not so blessed , and I must content myself with a record of my failure . Yet even earnest failure brings its joy and its holy reward . Though Mr. Smith will doubtless shine in the courts of Heaven under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall not be far distant from him , more modestly crowned , but crowned nevertheless , by a central yellow topaz set in a floral wreath of golden immortelles ; and above this chaste design a single fiery opal will burn . For ! have known what it is to heap coals of fire upon the heads of mine enemies , and I have felt the same coals scorch my own scalp in return . The differences in degree and quality of Mr. Smith 's success and my own are probably due to a multiplicity of causes , the most fundamental of which is the distinction between a Quaker child and a Presbyterian child . Mr. Smith had to be converted . As far as I know , this is a quite superfluous act of vainglory for any Presbyterian infant born in the faith . Although the Presbyterian Church has tacitly relinquished its right to election , and although it was never openly stated that election was hereditary , there still exists a gentlemen 's agreement between the Lord and Presbyterians that they and their children keep the inner track to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God . And I strongly suspect , anyway , that Western Red Indians are far easier to convert than the very simplest Eastern Chinese , all of whom are so well guarded against distracting influences that they even enjoy an endemic resistance to L.mallpox . They may bear the scars : they do not . iuccumb . And yet I can not conceal my envy of Mr. Smith . God ! how I should have liked , when I myself was seven , to whip into submission before the Lord those alley brats who lived opposite the mission compound in a crowded little street called Mulberry Lane . Instead , like Paul , I was halted on the road to Damascus . Paul was , I realize , converted ; but then Paul had not been a Presbyterian before his setback , though I think a strong case could be made out for his being a thorough one  --  and a missionary to boot  --  after it . PrHE alley brats were a constant thorn in A. the flesh of my sister , three years my eider , and me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the district on errands of malice , pitched rocks across the canal and bamboo fence circling our Presbyterian compound , harried the mongrel dogs on the streets , or , failing any of these amusements , fought fiercely with each other just to keep fit . If the Japanese army had tried to take that section of Shanghai by hand-to-hand fighting in the streets instead of hammering it down with guns and blasting it with bombs and fire , I would have backed the present generation of alley brats , sight unseen and at any odds , to shove them all into the Whangpoo River and spit accurately into their eyes just before they went down for the third time . The alley brats of my day would have done it in an evening and returned eager and merry to their scanty bowls of morning rice . Somewhere , perhaps , some of them are doing just that . These alley brats were led by a savage young amazon known to us as the Lady Bandit . Only once was her leadership challenged . Another wild creature , an albino girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her leading the gang down the road across the canal , her pink hair bristling , her pale eyes squinting as she searched for prey . The Lady Bandit was missing . On the sixth night my sister and I woke to a wild scream across the canal . The next morning the Lady Bandit was back at the head of the gang . That is all I know , but we never saw the albino again . This should be enough to explain why none of the boys in the gang ever tried to lead it . A variety of persecutions had been devised by the alley brats for the two foreign children . When we rode unescorted in a ricksha they leapt up and pulled off my sister 's hair-ribbons . If the ricksha man dropped the bars and gave chase , the rest of the gang surrounded us and taunted us with Chinese words I am sorry to say we understood perfectly . Or they would grab an end of my Windsor tie on gala days and pull out the bow and knot as the heavy silk scorched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over my diminishing stock of cravats , soone day she tied a square knot in a new Windsor before she made the bow . I bore the scar of that encounter for months . We were occasionally spat upon , and more than one stone sailed over the bamboo fence . The sorest part for us was that we were under strict orders never to retaliate . We were living witnesses of a peaceful order come to help these people , and how would it look if we raised a hand in anger against them ? I do not pretend that we could have taken on the feeblest alley brat and come out on top , but there were times when we would gladly have gone down fighting , spilling our lifeblood for the pagan joy of gouging out a single eye . But no . If one had been spat upon in the face , he sat bolt upright in the ricksha , taut flesh quivering and tears held back , a living witness , until he reached privacy and a washbowl . PrHE climax of this feud was reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgent opium binge . To inconvenience no one , he left the gate unlocked whenever he lay down for another pipe . Our garden was coming into early bloom and the alley brats saw their chance . Led by the Lady Bandit , they would dash across the bridge over the canal , sweep through the gate , and start ripping off the heads of the flowers . As soon as the servants or our parents saw them and shouted , they retreated with their booty . But one afternoon neither servants nor parents were at home . The gang swarmed into the yard and ran wild through the flowers . This was too much . My sister and I dashed out the front door screaming threats , and I picked up a brickbat from the border of the walk . Taken aback by this unusual display of courage , they all retreated to the bridge  --  all but one . The Lady Bandit stood a good twenty feet inside the gate , feet planted wide . She sneered at me . Only by purifying her Chinese can I translate her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you dirty little bastard ! " " I will if you do n't get out , you rotten turtle egg ! " I retorted with equal delicacy . " You would n't dare , you stinking little white ape 's abortion ! " she yelled . " Throw it , John , throw it ! " my sister urged . " Should I ? " I whispered , terrified . " Go ahead , " my sister hissed back . " We 've got to do something . " " Defiler of dead strumpets r ! the Lady Bandit bawled . " Putrid bitch of a running bitch 's granddaughter ! " I howled back . " Good work , John , but throw it , " my sister egged me on . " Incestuous spawn of camel 's dung ! " the Lady Bandit screamed . " Bloody mother of your own brother ! " I shrieked , and let fly . Swift and true as the stone from David 's sling , jagged edges twirling orange in the sun , my brickbat arched out and caught her squarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her head . Reeling back , she tasted blood . Then , shouting the Chinese equivalent of murder , rape , arson , and slaughter as the gang dissolved before her , she fled across the bridge into the mouth of Mulberry Lane . My life has not been without its simple joys , but I have never dared hope to feel again the surge of primitive triumph which swept me at that instant , the savage glee which raised the hackles on my neck and spread wide my nostrils . It did not last . Both my sister and I knew we had sinned : we would have to pay . But before our depression set in completely , we discussed the miraculous flight of the brickbat . I had never before hit anything at that range . Was it  --  could it have been  --  the hand of the Lord that guided me ? Or was it  --  and we shuddered  --  the hand of Satan ? We went back into the house , the clouds of Presbyterianism closing in upon us . ATE that afternoon , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Mulberry Lane swept into the compound and was fittingly received in the back yard . The Lady Bandit , still gory , was with them . Her parents ad-dressed my father with a demand for cornpensationi since the marriage value of their daughter had been lowered . Father , sending for medicines and bandages , set himself to cleansing the wound . He suggested mildly that their comely daughter had had no right to be in our garden . The Lady Bandit 's parents sidestepped this and demanded money . Father , tangled in a bandage , assured them that he would charge them nothing for the medicines he was using on their daughter . He admitted that his son , who , he pointed out , was much smaller than their daughter , had acted in haste and with an angry heart , but he repeated that their daughter had had no right to be in our garden . The medicine was still free . The Lady Bandit 's parents wavered . Listening from the kitchen window , trying vainly to control my reflexes , I wondered what sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever had . In later years , I should add , the Lady Bandit was betrothed to a meek-shouldered artisan and went off to live with his family for a year before the wedding . Every six weeks or so she would run away and come back to Mulberry Lane , where she made the air blue describing her prospective mother-in-law . This worthy woman would wait a few days , probably in relief , before coming to collect the girl with the fine beauty-mark on her forehead . Foolishly , she never asked my advice on how to handle her . But the Lady Bandit and I were quite good friends by that time . Our family was invited to her wedding , and some years ago I looked approvingly on her small son . This , though , was far in the future . VS ' itiLE Father was patiently holding his ground , the Lady Bandit 's neighbors , acting as seconds , cornered the cook and the amah , his wife , beneath the kitchen window , out of Father 's earshot . The cook led off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What right , he de-manded , did they think that snotty-nosed girl had to be in our garden wrecking the flowers ? He did not doubt that his mas-ter would take the whole affair to court , and if he did n't get complete satisfaction there , he would order a fleet of twenty American gunboats up the Whangpoo and blow the living hell out of Mulberry Lane . The seconds were thrown off balance and could only counter that the girl had been hurt . Of course she had been hurt , and rightly , the cook snapped . She had probably reviled the boy . That might be so , the seconds admitted , but at the same time , the girl said the little white devil was himself an artist in insult . The cook smiled broadly . Ari3 why not ? he wished to know . They might as well realize at once that the superior son of this house was the only son of an only son , first cousin to the President of the United States and a nephew of the King of England ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was endowed with a happy turn for felicitous phrases and the tongue of a five-clawed dragon . He would like to add as well , the cook went on , that the family he worked for was one of amazing refinement and wealth , so rich that they could spare two piculs of polished rice over a period of ten weeks and never miss it . That , the seconds said , was a very interesting statement . If they thought it was , the cook replied , they had better think it over , and that in a hurry , unless they wanted the twenty gunboats . As for himself and his wife , he continued , they had no more time to waste on alley trash , for they must retire and soothe the young master 's wounded feelings . The seconds drew away and got the ear of the Lady Bandit 's mother . The cook and the amah came into the kitchen , where he winked at me and she hurried out to find me some clean underwear . We watched the council break up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her parents and her parents ' neighbors bowed to Father and thanked him for the liberal gift of his rare medicines . Father returned to us , haggard but at peace , and we all relaxed . Mother had a little trouble balancing the household accounts for a while , but every seventh night for the next ten weeks the cook disappeared into Mulberry Lane carrying twenty cattier of polished rice . III THIS point my mother takes an active part . Mother married Presbyterianism . She was born a Baptist , and from her childhood immersion she has retained a faith in the essential goodness of the human heart which years of contact with Presbyterians have as yet failed to eradicate . Mother decided that the alley brats would make excellent subjects for her children 's Christian zeal . She pointed out to us that the alley children were not really bad children at all . They lived hard , meager lives , barren of beauty . They did not mean to ruin our flowers out of spite . Every soul had a love for beauty deep witEn itself which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by picking  --  picking , not stealing  --  our flowers . Now , if we did n't want the alley children to pick our flowers , what could be done about it ? The innocent light of purity struck our eyes . Almost in chorus we said , " They should have flowers of their own . " Mother smiled approvingly at this budding charity . Good , but how were they to have flowers of their own ? We hesitated and then rushed on . " We will give them flowers , " we said . Mother beamed . Gradually the plan was imposed upon us . First we gathered together thirty-odd tin cans and flower pots . Then we slipped or potted the best plants we could find , and day after day that spring we watered and cultivated them tenderly as we watched for signs of growth . Early in the summer we had about twenty sturdy little plants : geraniums , dwarf roses , daisies , pansies , a few bulbs . Most of them were in flower . And as the plants had grown , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a beginning . Slowly we would lead the alley children to God . We would cultivate their souls carefully ; we would have Sunday school for them and teach them the meaning of brotherly love . Eventually the alley children , clean in heart and body , would no longer whoop through the neighborhood , but , led by my sister and me , they would march up and down Mulberry Lane singing Onward , Christian Soldiers in Chinese , and we would win myriads of souls for God . Meanwhile , the gang had stopped persecuting us . We went out alone in perfect safety , and the cook assured me that he had done nothing to lessen my reputation as a hurler of brickbats and epithets . So we had no trouble when we went out into the highways and byways to invite the alley children to the mission compound the following afternoon at three for a surprise we had made ready . We were just wise enough to tell them that there would probably be something to eat . The next afternoon at three o'clock everything was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants glistened in beauty and love . On one table were set out pots of tea and Chinese teacups ; on another table were arranged large platters of cookies and cakes . HE gang , led by the Lady Bandit , arrived in reasonable order , and we shepherded them to the tables , where they promptly gorged themselves . Then , after a tour of the garden and a few free-forails among five or six of the junior lieutenants , my sister addressed the bewildered group . She told them we knew they were not evil , that they wanted beauty in their lives and we wanted them to have beauty in their lives . So we had prepared a gift of love for them which we hoped would flower into a lasting friendship between them and ourselves . ? After these elaborate flourishes , I gave a few halting instructions on watering the plants and putting them in the sunlight . My sister then concluded by saying that we hoped to see them again , and that wewould come to their homes and see how their flowers grew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presenting the two best to the Lady Bandit as a mark of special favor . This ceremony over , we all moved towards the gate , the Lady Bandit leading the way , a flower pot in each hand . At the gate the Lady Bandit turned and smiled at us , then bowed , and the rest did what they could to imitate her . Majestically the Lady Bandit led the procession on to the bridge while we stood watching in the gateway , our hearts filled with love for all mankind . W THEN she reached the precise center of the bridge , the Lady Bandit , without a flicker of hesitation , poised the flower pots and shot out both her arms . We gasped . A dwarf rose soared over the left railing , a white geranium cleared the right , and both plants splashed into the yellow water of the canal . As each alley brat reached the same spot another plant sailed out over the water . And the entire procession , not a one of them turning , went silently into the mouth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared around the corner did a ribald chorus of shouts and hoots rip the air and strike upon our horrified ears . This was bitter bread that had come back to us . We looked up at Mother . Her eyes were filling with tears , her lips were trembling . Gently my sister took her right hand and I her left . We turned her around and , burning foreheads held high , we walked with pride and Presbyterian hearts back to the house . If there had ever been a spark of Baptist fire in us , it was eternally quenched in those moments .
