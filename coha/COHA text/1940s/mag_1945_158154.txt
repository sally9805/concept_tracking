Superfortresses flying from China and Saipan opened the battle for Japan during the last half of 1944 , long before Allied troops could land on the enemy shore . But there was no overconfidence this time , as there had been when the strategic bombing of Germany began . There was no talk of winning the war in the Orient with air power alone . <P> Starved of gasoline and everything else that an air force needs , because it all had to be flown over the Hump , the 20th Bomber Command in China and India had run up , by year 's end , a tally of 23 assaults on Japan and Jap arsenals in Asia . The bombs dropped totaled about 5,000 tons-no more than a single major R.A.F. strike over Europe 's shorter hauls . But in those tentative stabs , the Superfort flyers had learned to know their planes-and the Japs ' defenses . <P> Good and Not So Good . The 21st Bomber Command , at Saipan , had started later and gained faster . In its first month of operations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons on Honshu , concentrating on aircraft factories around Tokyo and Nagoya . The Japs had new interceptors of improved types ( known as Jack and Irving ) . U.S. airmen did not underrate the threat of these planes ; the factories building them were top-priority targets . The Nakajima Company 's great Musashina factory on Tokyo 's outskirts was hit three times before year 's end . Said the 21st 's commander , Brigadier General Haywood S. Hansell Jr. , after the second assault : " We have n't destroyed the plant-not by a damn sight . " After the third blow , he still was not satisfied . " Possum " Hansell 's flyers had better luck against the two Mitsubishi plants at Nagoya . The Hatsudoki factory had 600,000 square feet ( 40% of its built-up area ) destroyed or gutted by fire . At Kokuki , photographs showed heavy concentrations of bomb hits directly on the assembly buildings and machine shops . <P> China-based B295 did their best job of precision bombing on an aircraft factory at Okayama , Formosa . Lanky , blond Brigadier General Lauris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this job better than any he had seen in Europe : 35 or 36 buildings that comprised this factory " just are n't there any more . " <P> All for One . There was no more talk of burning Japan 's papier-mch cities ; some , like Nagoya or Osaka , never modernized ( as was Tokyo after the 1923 earthquake ) , might be fired by overs or shorts intended for factories on their outskirts . If so , it would be incidental . After aircraft factories , highest priority targets would be shipyards , power plants and steel mills . But there was nothing rigid about the plan for bombing Japan or about the thinking of those who were doing the planning .
