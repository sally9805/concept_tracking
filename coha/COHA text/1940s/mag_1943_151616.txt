No helicopter has yet appeared over a battlefield , but there are signs that Igor Sikorsky 's strange windmill flying machine may see action before war 's end . A few are already being made in the Sikorsky plant of United Aircraft Corp . Last week the Army let it be known that this sideline building ( by a company already busy with engines , propellers and planes ) was not enough . It announced that it had given a contract for Sikorsky 's craft to Nash-Kelvinator Corp . Chief aim : quantity production .
