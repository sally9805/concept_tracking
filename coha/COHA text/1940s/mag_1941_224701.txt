On a mountainside in Kwangtung Province last week a Japanese naval plane crashed , killing bull-necked Admiral Baron Mineo Osumi , 64 , Japan 's Chief War Councilor . Known in Japan as a liberal influence second only to the late Elder Statesman Prince Kimmochi Saionji , Admiral Osumi was nevertheless also a stout advocate of the Japanese Navy 's southward urge to empire . At week 's end Chungking said that the plane had been shot down by guerrilla machine gunners , that the wreckage had yielded papers showing that Admiral Osumi was flying toward Hainan Island , off the south China coast , there to steer the united Japanese south China Sea Fleet on a southward drive .
