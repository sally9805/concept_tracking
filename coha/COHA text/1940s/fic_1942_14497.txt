SCENE : A background of curtains , against which is set the furniture of a farm kitchen . A white-enamelled range at stage left . In the center a leaf-table covered with light oil-cloth . To the right a kitchen cabinet . There are seven or eight chairs around or near the table . DECKMAN WEST and his wife , NELL , both about forty-five , have been eating the post-chores breakfast . Two sons , NEIL , eighteen , and ZIP , sixteen , are lingering at the table with them . CY , a lean old neighbor of fifty or so , is finishing a huge plate of boiled potatoes . His way with a potato is to cut it into chunks , then butter and eat one chunk at a time . It 's early April , 1941 . DECKMAN WEST How 's that creek road ? CY Under a certain amount of water . The snow 's melting down the south slope and the waves was breaking right under the wagon box . He looks at the dish of potatoes . If I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come by boat . DECKMAN WEST The table 's yours , Cy . We 're all through . CY Maybe you wondered a little why I did n't eat breakfast at home . Well , the truth is I 'm here to report I 've lost my wife and children . p. 3 NELL WEST Lost them ? What do you mean ? CY B'gob , they left me . NELL WEST Where have they gone ? CY Off down the road in a county car . NELL WEST You mean , the county took the children ? CY Welfare took ' em , Deck , wife and kids both . Come to find out , she asked for it . She complained the windows was broke out in the upper story and the boys was n't getting vitamins . Which was true . DECKMAN WEST You know , not to speak out plain or anything , if your farm got run down it was her doing . You got to have a woman on a farm , or it wo n't pay , and that one you had would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and I 'm gonta miss the little shavers , but looks like I 'm a bachelor from now on .  --  I was wondering if you needed a hired man , with a good team of loggin ' horses and a natural affinity for manure . DECKMAN WEST We could certainly use you , Cy , with Quizz in the army and these two in school most of the time . I do n't know what mother 'd say . NELL WEST Well  --  I 've been cooking for a kitchen full since I was twenty , and I may as well keep on . p. 4 DECKMAN WEST I do n't know . CY Plate of potatoes three times a day and sleep in the barn . NEIL WEST You do n't have to put up a sales talk , Cy . We know you 're good . ZIP WEST He 's certainly good at snakin ' logs . He can pile those big maples like toothpicks . CY Tell you what I 'll do . I 'll go out and help around the barn . Any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my blanket , Coming along , boys ? He starts to go . NEIL WEST Sure . DECKMAN WEST All right , Cy . CY and the BOYS go out . NELL WEST I really should get up and make myself start the dishes . DECKMAN WEST Putting an arm around herWhat 's the matter , mother ? NELL WEST Nothing , I guess . I do n't know . DECKMAN WEST You do n't want him here , do you ? NELL WEST I guess it 's  --  I kept thinking that I 'd have to see him across the table instead of Quizz . Maybe for years . DECKMAN WEST We 'll tell him to try further on . p. 5 NELL WEST Oh no , Deck . I was just thinking about Quizz and his coming today , that 's all . DECKMAN WEST Where 'd you put that letter ? NELL WEST On the side-board . I know it by heart if you want to hear it . DECKMAN WEST I want to look at it . He gets the letter and sits down . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'll see you , and that 'll be good . And I 'll have a chance to show you the most wonderful person in the world . " NELL WEST He ca n't be married . DECKMAN WEST No . She must be coming with him . NELL WEST She 'd better be beautiful . DECKMAN WEST Can you understand it , mother  --  our being grown up and having grown up children , old enough to wear a uniform ? NELL WEST No . I just ca n't understand it . DECKMAN WEST And I ca n't . Doggone it , I go rushing around here , buying hay and selling hay and suddenly I 'm an old man and my son 's fighting a war . NELL WEST Yes . DECKMAN WEST And I keep wondering about us when we were twenty . Did we look as young as that ? p. 6 NELL WEST I wonder . DECKMAN WEST And why did I have to have a funny little girl with glasses ? There I was , a dashing young Lothario , come of a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my feet , writhing for mercy , and what do I do ? I pick me a funny , little girl with glasses that did n't care whether I came or stayed . NELL WEST I never understood that either . DECKMAN WEST Well , it 's too late to change now . All those beautiful girls are grandmothers now . NELL WEST AffectionatelyI 'm not a grandmother yet , remember . DECKMAN WEST You could be . Quizz is twenty-two . NELL WEST Yes , but I do n't think I am . And you 're not a grand-father . But the war does rush everything . It sort of crowds us toward the exit . DECKMAN WEST I guess that 's what it is . There 's a car in the yard . Might be Peter . NELL WEST It 's past time for the mail . RALPH enters , Deck 's brother , two or three years older , with graying hair . A tall , dreamy farmer . DECKMAN WEST Morning , Ralph . p. 7 RALPH WEST Morning , Deck . Morning , Nell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , Nell , it 's getting so I drive in more to pass the time of day than to haul milk . If gasoline and milk cost the same I 'd break even , but prices being the way they are I lose money on the trip . To DECKI picked up your freight receipts at the depot . The Pennsylvania Railroad claims that hay 'll leave for the metropolis Tuesday morning . DECKMAN WEST Tuesday ? I 'm going to quit shipping out of Ischua . RALPH WEST The only thing to do with that town 's cut around it with a hay knife and sink it . He goes to the door . I just ran across a son of yours down the road . Wearing a kind of khaki colored suit of clothes . NELL WEST Really ? Where was he ? RALPH WEST Sitting on the porch at Feller 's . I offered him a hitch this way , but he had some particular business and said he 'd be right along . NELL WEST I 'd better call the Feller 's . RALPH WEST Phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter with it ? p. 8 RALPH WEST I do n't know unless old lady Boon burnt a connection with what she said over it last night . She called me up to speak about the telephone bill , and I told her the contraption was out of order half the time so I intended to pay half rates . She lit into me plenty hot , and I said , " Ma Boon , if you get too sassy I 'll chop this line loose from my woodshed and it 'll fall right back in your lap . " She was about to respond , but just that minute the wire went dead . I guess she thinks I took the axe to it . DECKMAN WEST Half the time when there 's a telegram for me she forgets to call me up , and I find out about it just late enough to lose a customer . NELL WEST But how did Quizz get out from town ? RALPH WEST I gather Pete was picking up the mail at the station . So he gave him a ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He steps out . NELL WEST How 's Ethel ? RALPH WEST Oh , she 's pretty docile . Give me another thirty years and I 'll break her in to being a farmer 's wife . Some days , when the weather ai n't bad , she comes pretty close to being affectionate . It just goes to show a woman can get used to anything . PETE FELLER enters with a handful of mail which he takes to the table. p. 9 PETE FELLER Hello , Nell . Nothing to sign . How you standing it , Ralph ? RALPH WEST Dwindling , Pete , dwindling . JANET FELLER , a neighbor girl , comes in with a package of yarn , lingering behind her father . NELL WEST Oh , Janet , thanks . That 's the yarn , is n't it ? You did n't need to carry it . JANET FELLER I just rode up with dad . I 'll walk back . NELL WEST Did n't Quizz come ? Were you joking , Ralph ? RALPH WEST Going toward the doorHe 's out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I brought your military man along with the mail . Be right in . RALPH and FELLER go out together . JANET FELLER He 's just getting a bag out of the car . NELL sits , looking toward the entrance . It 's hard to get khaki now . They let me have enough for one sweater . NELL WEST Well , I 'll knit one at a time , anyway . Sit down , Janet . JANET FELLER I guess I wo n't stay . I  --  She turns toward the door . DECK comes in carrying Quizz 's bag . QUIZZ , wearing a soldier 's uniform , follows him. p. 10 PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Hello , mother . Do n't get up , please . He crosses and puts his arms round NELL . And everything 's just the way it was . Mother and dad and the hill , and everything . I never thought I 'd climb that old hill again ! NELL WEST Why , son ? PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST It just seems like another world , there in the camp . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get away ? PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Well , kind of . You never know what 's going on , and you ca n't find out . Oh , Janet ! I want to  --  JANET FELLER I 'd better run home now . I have some things  --  PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Oh , no , you wo n't . Oh , no . JANET FELLER Yes , please . I 'd much rather . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Look , Janet  --  there 's only one of me  --  and I 've only got one day . I do n't want to waste it traveling up and down a dirt road . You stay here . NELL WEST Rising , beginning to suspectWhy , Quizz ! DECKMAN WEST Doggone it , mother , you can leave it to Quizz to keep things neat and handy . He 's picked himself a neighbor girl . I was wondering when some bright boy would notice there was a pretty girl at the Feller's. p. 11 NELL WEST More than one 's noticed that . JANET FELLER Please , Mrs. West . She wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janet . Stand still long enough so we can get this straightened out . NELL WEST I thought you meant you were bringing someone  --  PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST No , what I said was I wanted to show you the most wonderful person in the world . It was kind of a surprise when she turned out to be a next hill neighbor . But there it was  --  and there she is . DECKMAN WEST That 's one of the prettiest blushes I ever saw on a face , darling , so you step right out and show it . NELL WEST Yes , Janet  --  do n't hide away in a corner  --  JANET FELLER I 'm sorry . But she stays where she is . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST I 've got a lot of things to explain all at once  --  so maybe I 'd better start right in . I just managed to wangle this one day . I 'm supposed to be on my way to Fort Grace , you see , but I was able to prove to the old man I 'd get there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I can be here till five o'clock . p. 12 NELL WEST Oh . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Yes , just till five , mother . DECKMAN WEST I must say your soldier clothes become you , son . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST That 's how I managed to waylay Janet . It 's the uniform does it . NELL WEST But where in the world did you see Janet ? PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Ah  --  trust mother to put her finger on it . That 's the funny thing . That 's the thing you 'll never believe , because I do n't believe it myself . I was at Camp Upton , mother , and when I got my first day off I went to New York , naturally . There was nothing much to do in New York , not for a jeep with no money , so I took in Rockefeller Center .  --  There was a guide showing a whole crowd of us around , and when we got to the tower  --  JANET FELLER Quizz  --  PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Yes ? JANET FELLER Do n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JANET FELLER I do n't know . I just do n't want you to tell it . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Well , that 's the whole point of the story . It 's the whole point of everything . Everything up to now . p. 13 JANET FELLER No . No , please . You must n't , Quizz . Nobody knows about that . Nobody can ever know it . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Listen , darling , I do n't know what you mean . Dad and mother  --  they naturally  --  they said where in the world did we meet .  --  Well , there 's nothing wrong with it , only it was completely unbelievable  --  that 's all  --  so why not tell them ? JANET FELLER I never dreamed you 'd tell anybody .  --  I  --  to save my life I would n't tell anybody . And you ca n't  --  PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Well , look , Janet  --  you 're making it seem as if we had something to hide . There 's nothing wrong with the way we met . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see , I was standing beside this girl in the tower . I 'd been watching her all along , and then when I found myself standing beside her I said the first thing that came into my head . I said , " You 're the most beautiful person I 've ever seen in my life . " JANET FELLER I 'll never forgive you ! Never ! She rushes out . NELL WEST What 's the matter ? She rises . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST I 've no idea . I did n't want to hurt anybody 's feelings .  --  Well , I 'll finish it anyway .  --  I said , " You 're the most beautiful person I 've ever seen in my life , " and I meant it . And she looked at me very pleasant and cool and said , " Thank you . " And I said , " After this barker gets through barking maybe we could have a little lunch together . " And she looked me all up and down and looked at my uniform and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , I thought she looked a little familiar , but she was so blossomed out and beautiful it was n't till we were half way through lunch that I found out she was little Janet Feller that lived two miles away from here . And she did n't know who I was till I told her . Then  --  we had the afternoon and evening together  --  and  --  then we seemed to feel the same way  --  so  --  . p. 14 DECKMAN WEST How 'd she get to Radio City ? PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Won a contest . Maybe that 's what she does n't want me to tell . It was some silly business for high school girls in domestic economy classes . She baked the best cake with a certain kind of flour , and that was the prize , the trip to Radio City . NELL WEST Oh , I heard about it  --  that Janet won . DECKMAN WEST I 'll just step in and see if she 's through crying . He follows JANET . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Do you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done better , Quizz . She 's sweet . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST And you 'll forgive me for not coming straight home  --  and for maybe  --  not spending much time here  --  NELL WEST You 'd be a poor specimen if you hung around your mother much today , I guess . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST But  --  I love you . Just as much . And I 've never forgotten what you said to me . NELL WEST I 'm not very wise , son . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST You 're wise enough to tell me . NELL WEST Some things we think we 've learned , just by living , Deck and I , and one of them is  --  that 's the best part of life  --  loving somebody and being true . I think she 'll always love you . p. 15 PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST So do I. And it makes me  --  He crosses and kisses NELL . Never mind . You know what it does to me . NELL WEST It 's made me rich all my life . DECK comes out of the inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been telling Janet , mother , that we 've always wanted a girl . We have these three omadhauns of boys , and they damn near wore us out with their racket and their flying around .  --  But what we wanted was a daughter to smooth things out , and now we 've got one . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST I did n't want to hurt you , Janet . I just thought we might as well tell it the way it was . NELL WEST Maybe Janet thought it sounded a little as if you 'd picked her up  --  and she did n't like that . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Personally I like the way it happened . What 's a pick-up , anyway ? It 's love at first sight . So why not say it the way it was ? JANET FELLER But you could n't say it the way it was  --  because you had no idea what was happening . She still stands with Deck 's arm around her . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST I was there , was n't I ? p. 16 JANET FELLER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST What did you see that I did n't ? JANET FELLER If you 're going to be really honest and tell it  --  then I have to tell my side , too . You see , I knew who you were . From the beginning . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST You brat  --  you said you did n't . JANET FELLER I know . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Well , what of it ? JANET FELLER And I went and stood beside you on the tower . Because I  --  because you were from out here  --  and I  --  PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST You were lonely . JANET FELLER No.  --  You see  --  I knew if you told this I 'd have to tell it all  --  and  --  . You see , I knew who you were , the minute I saw your shoulders  --  and I 'd have known you anywhere . It seems to me  --  all my life I 'd have known you anywhere . You never saw me at all , but I knew every time your car passed the house . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go and stand beside you to make you notice me . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST You little devil ! But I was noticing you . p. 17 NELL WEST Darling , our Quizz is going to be away a long time from the looks of things , and you and I are both going to be lonely . It 's true  --  what Deck said about our wanting a daughter . Will you come up once in a while  --  when Quizz is gone  --  come over often as you can  --  and bring his letters ? JANET FELLER Yes , of course . NELL WEST Because I think he 'll write to you more than to us  --  and we 'll want to know where he is . JANET FELLER I 'll come . NELL WEST And now there 's only part of a day left  --  so you take your arm from around that slim waist , Deck , and turn her over to Quizz . DECKMAN WEST I get a kiss first . JANET kisses DECK . He releases her . NELL WEST If you 're hungry or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your day , what there is left of it . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST We thought we 'd walk back to Janet 's house and  --  sort of explore around . Maybe down to the cemetery meadow . The whole country seems new to us  --  because we never saw it together . DECKMAN WEST The road 's a bit sloppy for walking , and the wind 's raw , blowing off the snow . I know it 's spring according to the calendar . p. 18 PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST It certainly seems like spring to me.  --  Does n't it , Janet ? JANET FELLER Yes , it does . DECKMAN WEST I guess when you 're young you can smell it earlier . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST So we wo n't mind walking . NELL WEST Then off you go . And it 's spring . QUIZZ and JANET turn toward the door . NEIL and ZIP enter . NELL WEST Well , what do you know ! It 's a soldier ! ZIP WEST I gathered there was somebody important here ! They surround QUIZZ . Boy , you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello , Zip . Hell , you 're almost big enough for the army yourself . ZIP WEST Almost . You know what we 're doing today ? We 're taking time out to inspect our big brother . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST No school ? NEIL WEST Not when Quizz gets home on leave . ZIP WEST You know what we thought ? We thought maybe we ought to climb up and look at the maples . The sap 's running like a brook and Ralph says his syrup 's thick enough to fill a tooth . p. 19 NEIL WEST We thought we 'd like to candy a little on a snowdrift , the way we used to . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST I certainly would like to  --  NELL WEST You boys run along and let Quizz take a walk with Janet . They 're starting back toward her house together . ZIP WEST With  --  NEIL WEST Hello , Janet . JANET FELLER Hello . ZIP WEST What 's going on here ? DECKMAN WEST Good God , they can take a walk , ca n't they ? PRIVATE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll see you later . NEIL WEST Sure . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST So long . ZIP WEST So long , General . JANET FELLER Goodbye . QUIZZ and JANET go out . ZIP WEST What the hell is going on here ? DECKMAN WEST Looks a little to an old man like they was fixing to get engaged . ZIP WEST Yeah . I see . NEIL WEST I could run them down in Old Faithful . p. 20 NELL WEST They want to walk . NEIL and ZIP appear to be looking out a window . ZIP WEST In all that slush ? NELL WEST That 's right . ZIP WEST Looks like we lost the best brother we ever had . NEIL WEST Looks that way . CURTAIN p. 21 Act 1 , Scene 2 Act OneSCENE II SCENE : Six army cots set in two rows lengthwise to the audience as in an army barracks , and against the same background of curtains . QUIZZ sits on a bunk at the left rear , writing a letter on a pad which he holds on his knee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRIVATE SHEVLIN are rolling dice against a cardboard placed beside a cot . April , 1941 . CORPORAL TATE Head him off , somebody ! He 's rolling all sevens ! PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY Bite ' em , ivories , bite ' em for papa 's dinner ! Seven ! CORPORAL TATE Wait a minute ! PRIVATE SHEVLIN That 's right . Seven . CORPORAL TATE I 'm clean . That busts me . He gets up to move away . PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY Come on . Roll a couple more . PRIVATE SHEVLIN We gonto bump heads ? That 's no pleasure . PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY Want to come in ? PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST The way I work it out I 've got just enough to buy cigarettes and stamps and get my pants pressed . p. 22 PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY You mean you figured that all out ? PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST I had to . PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY You got to get over that , soldier . That destroys ambition . That eliminates the element of chance . You 're in the army for a whole year , remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army time ! CORPORAL TATE Stay away from him , Quizz . He 's on the beam tonight . He ca n't miss . He 'll rob you . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST I 'm staying out . PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY To TATEHey , what do you mean , sorehead ? You won yesterday , did n't you ? I never yet tried to swindle a deal but you started queering the customers ! You drive a man underground ! CORPORAL TATE O.K. You go underground and stay there ! PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY You mean this game 's going to languish because there 's a guy wo n't risk his money ? That ai n't life in the army , see ? Life in the army is like this  --  you get paid a little dab every so often . You take that little dab to a crap game and you either lose it or you run it up to something worth while . That 's the way you live here ! That 's the rhythm ! You got to get in the rhythm ! Come on , run it up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WEST O.K. I do n't want to break an Irishman 's heart . He starts to rise , but at that moment PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION enters . He is a handsome Southerner . PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY Turning on MARIONOh , boy ! Bat hides ! He gives out bat hides ! Come to me arms , Francis ! CORPORAL TATE Wow ! He 's in ! Pay me ! Pay me ! PRIVATE SHEVLIN Me first , Swamp Fox ! Me first ! PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION With poiseGentlemen , I greet you . PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY Did you get paid ? PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION I did . PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY Where is it ? MARION produces a small roll of bills . CORPORAL TATE How much ? PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION Allowing for the usual deductions , you ruffians will share among you the sum of twenty-two dollars and fourteen cents . PRIVATE SHEVLIN Where 's the fourteen cents ? PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION Forgive me . I bought a package of cigarettes . p. 24 PRIVATE SHEVLIN You should n't do that . Not without permission . CORPORAL TATE As they share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ten ! I only got two dollars last time ! PRIVATE SHEVLIN You do not ! CORPORAL TATE He owes me a month 's pay , and I only get two dollars ! Where 's the justice in that ? PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY That 'll teach you to grab quicker next time . They count their money . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST What is this ? A gang ? PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION No , suh , this is my holding company , a perfectly legal arrangement . To tide me over one crisis after another these gentlemen have lent me money  --  PRIVATE SHEVLIN Not if I had it to do over again  --  PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION And finding that my total borrowings had grown to an enormous sum , they organized to administer my affairs  --  also to prevent any addition to the list of my creditors . They are now a closed corporation , dedicated to supplying my modest needs and collecting my monthly honorarium . You , for example , could not extend me credit . They would n't allow it . p. 25 PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION It 's an inconvenience . PRIVATE BUSCEMI enters , puts away his overseas cap and Springfield . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST How much is that enormous sum you owe ? PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION Corporal Tate keeps the books , I believe . CORPORAL TATE The total was ninety-seven dollars before you came in the door . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST You mean you were able to borrow ninety-seven dollars against your thirty a month ? PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION People trust me no end . It 's my accent does it . PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY Hell , no , it was those ancestral estates in Marion County which I 'm beginning to doubt there is any such county now . PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION Mulveroy is the cynic of the enterprise . He refuses to believe that I am descended on my father 's side from Francis Marion and on my mother 's side from Patrick Henry . He refuses to believe that only three aunts , two uncles , seven cousins and a grandfather stand between me and my inheritance . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Is there any truth in it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it 's all true . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Then why in time did you have to borrow money ? PRIVATE SHEVLIN Because he drinks like a fish , that 's why . PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION You see , at heart I 'm a very sorrowful fellow , and when my sorrow mounts to a certain point , I must drink . CORPORAL TATE Also he drinks Cuba Libras , and they 're expensive . PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION But in the end I pay . You saw me in the act of paying . PRIVATE BUSCEMI Wait a minute ! I 'm a member ! Where 's mine ? PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION With dignityYes , you Yankee pirates , you carpet-bagging sons-of- bitches , Private Buscemi is a member in good standing ! Where 's his share ? He goes to his bunk and gets out a clean shirt . PRIVATE SHEVLIN If Mulveroy 'll let go of three dollars I 'll do the same . PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY ShriekingThree dollars ? PRIVATE SHEVLIN That 's right . PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY O.K. Together they pay BUSCEMI six dollars. p. 27 PRIVATE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're all going except dead men . CORPORAL TATE I 've got to wait here for Sergeant Ruby . He said something about appointing me Charge of Quarters . The rest begin to get ready to go out . PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY That 's right , you 're a corporal now . We got to watch this censored son of a censoring censor from now on . He 's joined the government . CORPORAL TATE Can I help it if I 'm brighter than you are ? PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY Now he 's talking about his I.Q. I saw you fooling with those little puzzles , Corporal . You did n't do so good , I guess . CORPORAL TATE I got ' em all across the river without eating each other , and that 's better'n you did , soldier .  --  I do n't know what happened to Ruby . He said he 'd be here at seven and it 's half-past . PRIVATE BUSCEMI He 's down at the mess-hall . All the tops are being lectured by a couple of staff officers down there . CORPORAL TATE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you care ? We 'll get it all from Ruby tomorrow . p. 28 PRIVATE BUSCEMI You wo n't get what I heard . I was standing guard right outside the window . There 's a sprout up in front with charts and figures and he 's discussing sexual intercourse . PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY Did he know about it ? PRIVATE BUSCEMI He 's got a theory about it . He says they made a study and he 's got it all down in percentages . Twenty per cent of the men in an army camp will refuse all temptations to sexual intercourse because they 've got wives or sweethearts and so they do n't want to play . And then another twenty per cent will take anything they can get . You know , the way it is with you , Mulveroy . PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY They got to have shoes . I draw the line there . They got to go home and get their shoes . PRIVATE BUSCEMI But then he goes on and says , there 's sixty per cent in between that maybe will and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The loot said that ? PRIVATE BUSCEMI That 's what he said . PRIVATE SHEVLIN I do n't know why he 's talking to the non-coms . They all belong to that lower twenty per cent . PRIVATE BUSCEMI And he 's got a project , the loot . He wants all the non-coms to help him . Look , he says , there 's twenty per cent that do n't need any help . And there 's twenty per cent you ca n't do anything with . But the big sixty per cent in between , there we can exert an influence , he says . There we can save a lot of boys from contamination . And if you ask me how , he says , there 's only one way  --  offer them something better . A pause p. 29 PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION For instance ? PRIVATE BUSCEMI That 's where the guard came to relieve me . I never did hear what they 're going to offer . PRIVATE SHEVLIN Now there 's perfidy for you . Sergeant Ruby comes out of a highly moral lecture like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sal . CORPORAL TATE Who 's Lill and Sal ? PRIVATE SHEVLIN I do n't know . All I know is I heard a little phone conversation through the wall up there , and Sergeant Ruby and Sergeant Kriven are meeting Lill and Sal at the Moonbow at eight o'clock . PRIVATE BUSCEMI Not the way that lecture 's holding out they wo n't . Mulveroy , do you know any Lill and Sal ? PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY Wait a minute . Sure . They 're twins . They live on Charlotte Street . Tourists and paying guests . They 've got an old mother to support . Last name 's Bird . PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION Are they virtuous ? PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY Wait a minute . I just remembered . I do n't know why I 've been passing them up lately . I used to have a home there . They 're wonderful . I think I 'll get there ahead of the Sergeant . He begins to hurry. p. 30 PRIVATE BUSCEMI To MARIONNo . Not virtuous . PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY By God , I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . They 're much too good for that goon . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Sergeant Ruby appears to be unpopular around here . PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY ShriekingSergeant Ruby ? You do n't know him yet . Wait till he tears into you ! He begins to imitate Ruby 's enunciation which sounds like Brooklynese dragged through all the slums of the world . ' Tenshun ! Fall in !

Tings like poimanent K.P. , and duty wit da foitilizer wagon , and latrine detail .

PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST I only know one thing . You ca n't run out on it . You have to go along and do your damnedest . PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION What 's the chance of us all being let out after our year 's up ? p. 34 PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Not a chance in the world . PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION That 's what I think . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Would you want to get out ? PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION For myself , I have infinite natural gall , and great presence of mind , but I 'm in a hell of a fog .

PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST You 'd rather be one that almost got killed and did n't . PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION Yes , but then another question arises . How close do I have to come to being horizontal before I earn the right to remain perpendicular ? PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST I do n't know that . PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION I guess nobody knows or we 'd have God damn well been told by this time . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST I know this much . I read the entire manual of arms coming down on the train , and it 's not in there . p. 35 PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION No . I looked for it there . I shall look for it tonight at the bottom of a coke with rum . That 's the bus now . They run out .

No other details of the room are visible . JANET sits on the edge of the bed in a robe , writing a letter in a tablet . She writes , then looks up , then writes again . Laying down the tablet , she thinks for a moment , then takes a khaki handkerchief out of the robe , unfolds it and smooths it on her knee . Her father calls from outside . She jumps guiltily . PETE FELLER OutsideJanet ! JANET FELLER Rising and thrusting the kerchief awayYes , daddy . PETE FELLER OutsideI 'm going into town . Anything you want ? JANET FELLER When are you going ?

PETE FELLER Shall I say you 're going into town with me ? JANET FELLER Will you , daddy ? PETE FELLER Sure . And you can mail the letter yourself . JANET FELLER I 'll just put on a dress . She throws off the robe , slips two dresses from their hangers , chooses the dark one and puts it on . Then she takes a hasty glance in a little mirror , picks up the letter , opens it to kiss the end , stamps it , and starts to go . The handkerchief has fallen to the floor .

LILL and SAL are seated at it with a couple of drinks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiations are in progress . LILL and SAL are both wearing a little too much of everything , but they are attractive . LILL BIRD Sure , you can sit down if you want to , Mr. Mulveroy , that is as far as I 'm concerned you can sit down , but as far as Sal 's concerned I ca n't speak for her , because we make a point of being entirely separate and distinct personalities . PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY Look , Lill  --  He sits . LILL BIRD So as for her I ca n't decide , but I will say , Mr. Mulveroy , when a soldier comes in and sits down at a table a girl 's got the privilege to say she was waiting for somebody else . PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY You better let me sit beside you , girl , because you 've been taking that one extra drink and you 're getting elaborate for this early in the evening . LILL BIRD I am not elaborate ! I 'll murder anybody that says I 'm elaborate ! Was I , Sal ? SAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 39 LILL BIRD Gee , was I ? Maybe I was , at that .

PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY I been walking up and down the whole world , kid , and I never found anybody I loved like Lill . He whispers in her ear . She listens stonily . SAL BIRD To BUSCEMIYou better ask your friend to sit down . You 'll never get anywhere standing up in the middle of a restaurant . PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION I 'll sit over here . SAL BIRD No , sit with us , soldier . There 's safety in numbers . BUSCEMI is next to SAL . MARION sits beside BUSCEMI . A WAITER goes through on flat feet . PRIVATE BUSCEMI Oh , waiter ! The WAITER disappears . SAL BIRD He 'll see you by appointment only . LILL BIRD To MULVEROYAll I can say is you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY And I know why it 's inconvenient , too . LILL BIRD If you know why it 's inconvenient , will you kindly go on the air with the information ? PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY I got back last night , see ? I been a cadreman out at Fort Knox . And what 's the first thing I hear ? I hear Sergeant Ruby bragging he 's going out tonight with Lill and Sergeant Kriven 's going out with Sal . Now , mind you , if you like him better that 's all right . Only I do n't like the way he talks about you . LILL BIRD You 're no cadreman . Was he ever a cadreman ? PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION Indeed he was a cadreman at Fort Knox , Miss Bird , and he has just returned . LILL BIRD To MULVEROYYou certainly got handsome friends . O.K. If you say it I believe it . What was Sergeant Ruby talking about ? PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY He was just explaining how he and Kriven had a technique that never failed yet , see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with girls . LILL BIRD What kind of time ? PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY War time . PRIVATE BUSCEMI And tonight they 're going to use it on you . p. 41 SAL BIRD Oh , you heard it , too ? PRIVATE BUSCEMI Oh , sure , I heard it . SAL BIRD It 's kind of touching the way they all tell the same lies , ai n't it ? Kind of like the three musketeers . Only it 's going to be thick with sergeants around here in a few minutes . Maybe you-all 'd better take cover . PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY Why do n't you cut away with us now ? LILL BIRD Because I gave my word of honor we 'd be here at eight o'clock , and that 's all a poor girl 's got . Just her word of honor , that 's all . She takes a sip . Just her word of honor . PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY You better let me put one hand over that scamper juice like I used to . You 're getting elaborate and la-de-da . LILL BIRD I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sal , am I getting la-de-da ? SAL BIRD You better let him put his hand over your drink . LILL BIRD O.K. You can put your hand over it . But it do n't mean anything . MULVEROY shields her glass with one hand . The WAITER goes through again . PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY Waiter ! Waiter ! We want three Cuba Libras and five hamburgers ! The WAITER disappears . MULVEROY jumps up . Hey , for God 's sake , what is this ? He yells after the WAITER . You hear that ? Three Cuba Libras and five hamburgers ! QUIZZ comes in quietly and sits beside MARION. p. 42 PRIVATE BUSCEMI Make mine well done with onions . PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY Two of them well done with onions ! SAL BIRD Make mine rare .

We do n't want to be caught on the downbeat . LILL BIRD You 'll have to take off , Mr. Mulveroy . We 're waiting for the sergeants . PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY Oh , you 're waiting for the Goodyear men . O.K. , girl . We know what they think about you . We saw those two in the drug store tonight , buying medical supplies ! p. 43 LILL BIRD You did not ! PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY You got a low threshold for Goodyear sergeants ! LILL BIRD I hate sergeants , and I hate you , and I hate the whole damn army !

We had everything nice , and we went to church on Sunday , and I could ' a got married , and then you come along with your army and it 's all spoiled ! I want it to be the way it was before you came along ! PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY Wait a minute ! There was a sergeant before I came along ! LILL BIRD There was not ! I 'll murder  --  He was going steady with me before you came long , and now what do I get ? They want to have a drink and then they want to go out and look at the stars ! Astronomy ! Only they never see the stars ! Oh , no ! And I hate you all and the whole God-damn army and I want it to be the way it was ! SAL BIRD You better quiet down , Lill , and all four of you scram .

PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION He 's going for a cadreman . An apostolic cadreman . The WAITER enters with a tray , halting the quartet in the door . SAL BIRD Hey , who 's paying for this ? PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY Going outCharge it to astronomy . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST I 'll pay for it . MULVEROY , BUSCEMI and the TWO GIRLS go out . SAL BIRD What ? PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST I 'll pay for it . p. 46 SAL BIRD You know , I like this silent job here . When he speaks he says something . That 's the first word he spoke , but , boy , did he make it count ?

LILL BIRD I used to love the organ . But that church is strictly a wreck now . The windows and everything . It used to be beautiful . PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION " Beautiful as a wreck of Paradise . " LILL BIRD What 's that ? PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION It 's a line from a valentine a civilian wrote long ago . " Beautiful as a wreck of Paradise . "  --  I used to be a civilian myself .

PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST We promised to save them from worse than death , that 's all . PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION Do n't you have any hankering after the flesh-pots ? PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Some . It 's the drinks mostly . PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION I have a hell of a hankering . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST It wo n't kill you . PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION What if there 's never anybody else , not even Lill and Sal ? What if we never lie with anything warmer than the Pacific Ocean ? PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST You 're maudlin .

PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION I do n't know as I like a man with that much character . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST It 's not character . I just belong to the twenty per cent the loot was talking about . p. 56 PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION Very well . You 're the strong solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your judgment and follow .

CURTAIN p. 57 Act 1 , Scene 5 Act OneSCENE V SCENE : The stage is arranged in two sections . On the left the kitchen is set against the curtains more or less as before . On the right Nell 's bedroom , consisting only of a bed and a chair or stand , takes up half the stage . When the curtain rises the bedroom is dark , and only the kitchen is seen . DECK , NELL , NEIL , ZIP , JANET , RALPH and FELLER are sitting or standing about listening to QUIZZ . September , 1941 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had n't been so damn lucky to start . You see , the battery commander gave me three days , and said , " You better make the most of it . I ca n't promise you any more . " So I grabbed my extra shirt and started for Amityville . Well , before the bus came along , I got picked up by a fellow in a station wagon that wanted me to help him drive . Sure I could help him drive , and then , on the way into town , he told me he was driving to Buffalo , New York , to deliver some pedigreed sheep . ZIP WEST Buffalo ? PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Yeah . Practically in our back yard . He had the sheep in the back , a ram and five ewes . He wanted to drive all night , and would I come along to spell with the driving ? Well , it was going to save me all that train fare , so I like a fool took him up . Only that night after dinner he disappeared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I could find him and get started . He was pretty stinking , and I was going to quit and take the train right there , but he gave me all his money to keep for him , and the key to the car , so I thought it was going to be all right . Anyway , I had to take care of the sheep . He did n't even know enough to give ' em water . He did n't know there was any use for water any time . Well , the next night , right in Wellsville , he disappeared again . He did n't have a cent of money with him , but he stole two tires off his own station wagon and sold ' em to get drunk on . Well , I fed and watered the sheep and then I found him and gave him his money and the key to the car , and I took the next train . He can stay there and drink the rest of the tires and his pedigreed sheep , too . But I lost most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to start back tonight . p. 58 NEIL WEST No matter how much time you start out with it always whittles down to one afternoon .

NELL WEST It 's worse for you than for us . DECKMAN WEST To JANETGet out your camera , girl . Maybe he 'll stand still long enough for a snap-shot . ZIP WEST Just a sucker for pedigreed sheep , that 's all . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST God , I could have kicked myself all the way to Cattaraugus County  --  and I 'd have made better time if I had . RALPH WEST Have they let you fire a gun yet ? PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST I do n't pull the lanyard . So far it 's been my job to lug ammunition and cut the fuse before firing . We 've got a good gun section . Anyway we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be nervous work , cutting a fuse .

NELL WEST They 'll be right out , Cy . They 're just hanging around to embarrass Quizz and Janet . ZIP WEST Do n't hurry the help , ma . I have n't finished my dessert yet . NELL WEST Then you wade into it . DECKMAN WEST It 's going to rain tonight , and we have to finish the cemetery meadow so we can move the rig .

Jeez , it was at least something when you could get Hollywood on the air ! You mean nothing to do but write letters ? PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Oh , the hell with you ! I feel good tonight . I know of a lot of Japanese have n't got anything to write home about . PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION Quizz ? PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Yes , Francis . PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION It 's got me again . Everything looks very peculiar  --  including you . CORPORAL TATE Get ready to hold him down , everybody . He 's got about a hundred and six . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST How do I look , boy ? PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION Give me a drink . QUIZZ holds the gourd for him. p. 89 CORPORAL TATE He ought to swallow some more quinine . I 'll find Ruby . He goes out right . PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION You look gigantic . Like a great bat  --  wavering against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing  --  Quizz ! PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Yeah ? PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION I 'm sorry . It 's nothing . He looks steadily at a spot where there is nothing visible . Quizz ? PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Yes ? PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION Will they laugh at me if I talk to her ? PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Certainly not . PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION Because she 's here . This is the ends of the earth , and she followed me here . He looks at the others . They 're all ghostly , like shadows from a fire flickering on the ceiling . And you 're a ghost  --  and Pepe . But the Wraith 's as cool and clear as an April morning . Lady sweet , you 've been La belle dame sans merci so long , I do n't know how to welcome you . She 's not really here , Quizz . She smiles at me , but she says nothing . It 's just the fever that makes my eyes think they see her . p. 90 PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST She 's as real as I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION It 's the fever , and my terrible longing .  --  There 's a poem we used to say . If she 's real she 'll answer . " Raise the light , my page , that I may see her .  --  Thou art come at last , then , haughty queen ! Long I 've waited , long I 've fought my fever : Late thou comest , cruel thou hast been . " He pauses . You see , she 's supposed to speak , and she does n't . " I forgot , thou comest from thy voyage ; Yes , the spray is on thy cloak and hair.But thy dark eyes are not dimmed , proud Iseult ! And thy beauty never was more fair . " He pauses . No , there 's no answer . There is a sudden nearby thunder of airplanes . The BOYS listen , rigid . PRIVATE BUSCEMI No use going out there . It 's too dark to use the ack-ack .

PRIVATE SHEVLIN Hey , do n't be a damn fool . But QUIZZ is gone . BUSCEMI goes to the exit . No use sticking your gourd out . The noise of the planes continues for a few moments . Then there is a distant detonation and the planes are heard no more. p. 91 PRIVATE BUSCEMI That last was over the north island . QUIZZ re-enters . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST They did n't get the gun but they certainly got the path . Laid one right in the middle of it . There 's a hole thirty feet deep .  --  Kriven 's in with the boat . They must have just missed him . PRIVATE SHEVLIN I 'll bet he 's shaking in his shoes . PEPE To MULVEROYNot good , the water ? PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY It 's getting pretty warm , baby . It could be colder . PEPE I get it . She takes the gourds and goes out . PRIVATE SHEVLIN Personally , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUSCEMI They wo n't come back today . KRIVEN enters with a haversack , which he takes off . He looks about . SERGEANT KRIVEN Where 's Ruby ? PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST I think he went down to his quarters , Sergeant . Tate went looking for him to get some quinine . SERGEANT KRIVEN I got some here . He fishes out a far . Two hundred tree grain tablets . Who wants it ? p. 92 PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Marion . SERGEANT KRIVEN Handing the jar to QUIZZ . Feed it to him . QUIZZ administers it . Also , I got about a quarter cord of stinkin ' dried fish . And that 's all . PRIVATE SHEVLIN We 're out of salt . SERGEANT KRIVEN Oh , yeah  --  and a bag of sea-dust . And the C.O. says we can get the hell out of here any time . SHEVLIN AND MULVEROY What 's that ? PRIVATE BUSCEMI You talked to the C.O. ?

PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY To QUIZZYou hear that , soldier ? p. 93 PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST I never heard anything sounded better . SERGEANT KRIVEN And da C.O. gives me a letter , for Lieutenant Siegel . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST He was killed this morning , Sergeant . SERGEANT KRIVEN Yeah ? Jeez ! Well , da letter 's got instructions in it , so I better give it to Ruby . He fishes out a note , then pauses . Dere was two men coming down ta path when I came in wit ta outrigger . Dat Jap bomb got bot of dem . Is everybody here but Ruby and Tate ?

I ai n't no ruttin ' Harvard man . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Reading " Dear Siegel : Considering your reported scarcity of food , quinine and ammunition it appears necessary to evacuate H 23 moving all remaining personnel to H 25 , the nearest base where hospitalization is available . The Japs are moving in , and it will not be possible to hold any of this group permanently while Tawi is in their hands . This is not an order , however . Your defense of H 23 and your destruction of batteries and shipping have slowed the enemy considerably . Every day you can hold your position is an incalculable gain . Just for the record let me say that your gunnery has set a high standard , and we 're all proud of you . We 've seen some of your shells land . If you have to fall back do n't think for a moment you have n't done yourselves proud . G. Solway , C.O. , H Sector . " p. 94 SERGEANT KRIVEN I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you better get ya duffle ready so we can start before da sun comes up . PRIVATE SHEVLIN Yes , sir . They begin to pack up . Nobody speaks for a moment . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST You think we ought to go ? SERGEANT KRIVEN What do you tink ? PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST I do n't know . SERGEANT KRIVEN Look , when ya in a army ya do n't have to make it tough for yaself . You can leave dat to da C.O. and da Japs . PRIVATE SHEVLIN We had it tough enough , buddy . SERGEANT KRIVEN You tink we ought ta stay here ? PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST I do n't know . SERGEANT KRIVEN Listen . Dere was tirty-two men on dis island besides Gooks . Now we down to what 's here . Some of us sick and da rest of us going to be sick . Maybe we get off a ' here tonight , but if we do n't go tonight maybe we never get off here . Da C.O. says dese islands ca n't be held . He says go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST No . I want to go home . More than I ever wanted anything in this world . More than I 'll ever want anything again . But I do n't want to  --  run out . p. 95 PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY He says , " If you have to fall back do n't think you did n't do yourselves proud . " PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST I know . PRIVATE BUSCEMI Then for God 's sake what 's eating you ? PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION How close does a man have to come to being horizontal before he 's earned the right to remain perpendicular ? PRIVATE SHEVLIN We 've come close enough . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST It sounded to me as if he was pleading with us  --  to hold on . If we possibly could . PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION There are tens of millions back home who have hardly been touched at all , tens of millions who have risked almost nothing . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST I know . But they are n't here . And we are . SERGEANT KRIVEN Listen , if you guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY Mother of God ! I thought we was out of here ! PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST I 'm not deciding it .

PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY Maybe we ought to stay , at that . The C.O. 's staying on his ruttin ' rock . PRIVATE SHEVLIN Damn it , now you 're saying it ! PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY I 'll shut up .

PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Mother , I 've come to a place  --  NELL WEST Oh , please come closer . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Yes , of course . The light comes up a little on QUIZZ , but still leaves him half in shadow . Is that better ? NELL WEST Yes . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Mother , I 've come to a place where we have to choose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven back  --  or hang on here . But if we do hang on  --  I doubt if we 'll all live . I doubt if any of us will . And , mother , in the night , one wonders what to do . So I 've come to you . NELL WEST Is n't there some way  --  to do what you must  --  and still come home ? PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Yes . We 're not ordered to stay here . It 's only  --  that we 're needed , and we know it . And this is what troubles me most . I 'm in love , mother . I 'm so much in love it 's a pain to be away . Every mile away from her was a hurt in my side . And we 've never been together . I 've never made her mine . NELL WEST I know . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Oh , mother , I 've never taken any woman , because you said I should keep myself pure for my love . So I kept myself for her  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's too late .  --  Oh , mother , sometimes it seems it 's better to stay alive , no matter what guilt you feel  --  if only you can take your love in your arms again  --  and lie on her breast  --  and live . Live a little at least before you die . p. 99 NELL WEST Oh , my son , does it matter about giving up one place to the enemy ? It wo n't matter as much as your lives . It 's better to live . If you live now you can fight them again . And we 'll see you . We 'll see you here again . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Should I choose to come home , mother ? Oh , do n't make it easy for me . NELL WEST Must you choose ? Does n't someone choose for you ? PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST It seems they 'll do as I say . They 'll go as I go . A pause NELL WEST Oh , Quizz !

PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST It 's so far to you , so far across time and space and date-lines , yes , sometimes it seems clear across eternity . Can you hear me ? There as you lie in your bed ? JANET FELLER Yes , sweet . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST For me , here on this hot rock island , it 's high noon  --  and for you it 's midnight . We 've let the night go by and half the day  --  and still we 're not clear in our minds whether to go or stay . JANET FELLER Where , darling ? PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Here , here on this hot rock island . It 's up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skins  --  and I do n't think I 'd be tempted to say " Let 's go " if it was n't for you , there in your midnight bed , half a world away from me , half a world , and never  --  never made mine , never to be mine now if I cling to my place here . She sits up and looks into the darkness. p. 101 JANET FELLER What can it be ? I thought  --  I thought you spoke to me , Quizz . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Yes , I did speak . JANET FELLER Where are you ? PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Here . The light shows his face . JANET FELLER Then it 's true . You 've come home . Oh , darling , please , never leave me again ! PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST I must ask you something . Sweet , we had no house . No place and no time , and it seems to me I 'm only a ghost forever if I should die and you 've never been mine in the night , as if I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no name  --  and another must take my love , my lost uncompleted love . JANET FELLER Oh , darling , I 'm yours or never never anyone 's . PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST The earth wo n't have it that way  --  the dark old plodding earth says if you 're dead you 're dead , and a living girl must mate among the living . So if I die now I give you to another , and I know that  --  JANET FELLER No , Quizz , never  --  and you must n't die ! What makes you speak of dying ? PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST It 's noon on this rock and torrid hot , and six of us who are left sit in the cave to vote , do we go or stay , do we make a try for H 25 and home or man the gun while we can , fire the few shells , sink the invasion barges , never let them in till they 've paid the last death . And when they come in be then the threshold , lie there with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 102 JANET FELLER Who asks this of you ? They should n't ask it ! PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Nobody asks it , dear . It 's something in myself I do n't understand that seems to require it of me . It seems to be the best of me  --  the same inner self that turned to love you and love no one else , that says give more than is asked of you , be such a man as she you love could honor at a secret altar knowing all you 've thought and done . But as for orders we have none now . We 're free to go back or stay save for what 's in our minds . And so it seemed I must talk with you  --  for you 're at the heart of me  --  either way it 's for you what choice I make  --  and I thought it might all come clear if I saw your face and heard you speak . JANET FELLER But you say such terrible things  --  that I 'd love someone else if you were gone  --  PRIVATE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's true and then decide  --  because I must look at our dark old plodding earth the way she is , and then do what I must . Please , help me see truly ! JANET FELLER Oh , Quizz , come home ! And oh forgive me , please forgive me now for knowing so little when you went away , for letting you leave me , mine and yet not mine  --  for I did n't know  --  but the empty days and nights have taught me now how if you 've missed your love there 's nothing to put in its place . So you must come home . Oh , come and find me . Do n't leave me empty here . What could you win worth losing what could be ours ?  --  What could you win ? p. 103 PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Seeing you there in your bed where I 've never lain , it seems that I 'd give all heaven and all the earth , and all men ever had , to put my arms round you once . You 're more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Never for anyone else . Please come home to me here . If you should die I think I 'd die too . And I do n't know what to say . I say the wrong things .

PRIVATE THOMAS MULVEROY I smuggled that bottle out here disguised as Irish whuskey . Whuskey a sergeant can understand , but penetrating oil , that earns a firing squad .

PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST We 're going to make holes in the bottoms of those barges , as fast as they come out . PRIVATE SHEVLIN We 're going to try to hold the island ? PRIVATE QUIZZ WEST Was n't that what we decided last night ? PRIVATE SHEVLIN We did n't decide anything last night . We just sat around . Then it looked like it was too late to do anything . But we could still get out of here , you know . We could take the outrigger and cross to H 25 before those barges were anywhere near here . SERGEANT KRIVEN Dat 's right . Dat 's a trut ' .

PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION Gentlemen , I find that my natural cynicism is not decreased by tropical malaria and short rations . The apothegms and rebel yells that spring to my lips at this moment are not such as you might expect from one who numbers Patrick Henry among his great-great-grandsires .

But I vote to try it another day . p. 109 PRIVATE BUSCEMI What ? PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION I vote to try it another day , and probably another day after that . PRIVATE BUSCEMI Why in hell do you do that ? PRIVATE FRANCIS MARION Because man is not a reasonable creature .

In those numberless islands there are many natural fastnesses , well equipped for defense , difficult to attack . Mopping up operations may take many months  --  and may never be completed . How many American soldiers still hold out in that wilderness of atolls and volcanic peaks is , of course , a military secret , but even if it were not , there is nobody either in Washington or elsewhere who knows all the facts as of today .

You have of course been notified that Private West is listed as missing . H 23 , the island on which he was stationed , was captured by the Japanese about two months ago . It is impossible to report definitely concerning our men who were on the island , but it is supposed that some are prisoners .

He 's alive , and he 's well , and he 'll come through and get home . NELL WEST That 's what I believe . JANET FELLER But not so certainlyYes . DECKMAN WEST And I know what I 'm going to do . There 's only one thing for a man to do nowadays  --  and that 's go out and enlist . NELL WEST Enlist ? DECKMAN WEST And I do n't care what in ! Any armed service where I can get a chance to fight .  --  That 's what I want ! That 's what I 've wanted to do all along  --  and now I 'm going to do it ! NELL WEST Do you think  --  ?

JANET FELLER Let me help you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . JANET FELLER I want to help you . She carries some dishes . Do you think he 'll come back ? NELL WEST I do n't know , Janet . I guess we just hope so . JANET FELLER Because I  --  I ca n't think so . In my mind . Can you ? NELL WEST Why do you ask me ? JANET FELLER Did you ever have a feeling that he was near you in the night ? p. 117 NELL WEST Yes , more than once . JANET FELLER I suppose one imagines .  --  But that 's why I think I wo n't see him again . It 's  --  as if he told me . They made a decision that meant they would n't come home . NELL WEST A decision ? JANET FELLER Yes . NELL WEST Could it be that we have the same dreams ? JANET FELLER Did you have it , too ? She takes Nell 's hand . NELL WEST Wait .  --  It 's shadowy now , the way dreams are in the daytime . But for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FELLER I suppose it was dreams . But the last time it was so real I could have touched him  --  so real I can remember words he said . NELL WEST What did he say ? JANET FELLER He said , " Those who love you ca n't tell you what you must do . They can only say , save yourself . If they love you they ca n't say anything else . But the soldier , there with his comrades , and with the enemy in front of him , he must decide for himself . " That 's why I think he wo n't come home . NELL WEST Janet , darling , you 've been carrying this with you , all these weeks ! p. 118 JANET FELLER But something happened between us that last night  --  that gave me a way to live . He said , " Do n't think it 's all loss . There 's a kind of glory between us we could n't have had . We eat our iron rations at a secret altar . " It 's  --  as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have loved you terribly , for his words reach you clear round the earth . JANET FELLER I love him terribly . But  --  if they 'd left the island they 'd have been defeated  --  in their own hearts  --  and when they stayed there  --  that was a victory . I would n't want him to be defeated . We ca n't decide for them because we love them . NELL WEST He 's yours now forever , darling . He was mine for a little while , but you 'll have him always , even if he does n't come back . DECK comes in followed by RALPH . DECKMAN WEST Happened to remember about that news broadcast , so if you girls wo n't laugh at me I 'll just turn it on . He tunes the radio . NELL WEST How 's the mowing ? RALPH WEST Just starting on the cemetery meadow , Nell . It 's a good stand . High and heavy . The radio speaks p. 119 THE RADIO " Have you noticed that our soldiers almost never talk about the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've noticed it . And have you wondered why ? I think I know . This is the first war in history where there 's no possible argument about who 's right and who 's wrong . We 're fighting for our lives and fighting to keep men free . You ca n't argue about that . You do n't need any oratory to convince people , nor songs to keep up their spirits in such a war . And so it 's a war without oratory and without songs  --  because we know very well what we 're doing . " CY comes to the door , stands for a moment without speaking . RALPH WEST Something on your mind , Cy ? CY You know , Zip got out of a car down at the corners , and he 's walking up the road , and there 's a soldier coming with him . He pauses . A soldier looks like Quizz . DECKMAN WEST Like Quizz ? CY I swear to God  --  it looks like Quizz ! DECK gets up from the radio , and goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it across the room . NELL and JANET have risen . NEIL comes in wearing a uniform , followed by ZIP DECKMAN WEST What 's this mean ? p. 120 NEIL WEST It 's mine , dad . DECKMAN WEST No wonder he said you looked like  --  NELL WEST Oh , Neil , Neil ! NEIL WEST I know I should have said something first , but I was afraid you 'd say no . DECKMAN WEST I guess we would have . NELL WEST Oh , Neil ! You could have waited till later . Till you were called . NEIL WEST No , I could n't mother . ZIP WEST And I ca n't , either . NELL WEST You , Zip ? What do you mean ? ZIP WEST They would n't take Neil in the air force because of his eyes . So he joined the artillery . But they 'll take me . DECKMAN WEST You 've signed up for a pilot ? ZIP WEST I have to get your permission . NELL WEST If it had come a little later . Today  --  Janet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether he 'll come back . It 's sort of a last letter  --  NEIL WEST That 's why we had to go , mother . That 's why we could n't wait . Because of Quizz . It 's what Quizz would want us to do . p. 121 DECKMAN WEST How do you know that ? NEIL WEST I do n't know . But it 's as if I could hear him saying it . We could n't stay here on the farm , and know he 'd left something unfinished out there . We had to take it up  --  and carry it on . ZIP WEST I 'm the age they want , mother . For the air force . And if I 'm old enough to fight , I 'm old enough to make up my mind . NEIL WEST As a matter of fact I have n't been at the U. for a couple of months . Zip 's been kind of covering for me . I did n't write because it seemed better to talk about it , mother . NELL WEST Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when there was only one important thing to do in the world , to look the other way , and let somebody else do it . I know you thought I was coming back to the farm , and I know they need farm workers , but  --  tell the truth I want to get out there where the fight 's going on . Suppose they make the world over , more the way it ought to be , and everybody has a better chance  --  well , I want to pay for my ticket . DECKMAN WEST I suppose it might turn out better . NEIL WEST Anyway , if it is n't I do n't want it to be my fault . ZIP WEST That 's right . p. 122 DECKMAN WEST Mother , what can we do with these two ? What can we do ? NELL WEST What can we do , Janet ? JANET FELLER I guess Quizz would say  --  we had to let them go . DECKMAN WEST Maybe I 'm just holding back from being old , but they look mighty young to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The army do n't want us any more , Deck . I tried it . DECKMAN WEST You tried it ? RALPH WEST I went down and tried to enlist . But they want these young fellows . They 're the men of the house now . They 're the fighting men . NELL WEST Going over to DeckAnd it 's true we ca n't hold them back because we love them . Every man has to follow his own vision . That 's the way new world 's are made . DECKMAN WEST All right , boys . You go out and make things over your way . We old folks , we 'll stay here , damn it , and milk the cows and run the baler . NEIL and ZIP cross to kiss NELL.
