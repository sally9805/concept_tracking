txt Those Florida Oranges BENJAMIN KUSHNER. pg . 26 Letters to The Times Those Florida Oranges To THE EDITOR OF THEPEW YORK TIMES : In reply to the letter by A. E. of Hackensack , N. T. , printed in your paper of Dec. 25 , I should like to point out the following : The fact that Florida oranges are sold at a penny apiece in Miami is sad enough for the orange-grower , yet we must take into consideration that the oranges sold in Miami do not have to be packed as those that are shipped out of the State and the cost of transportation is saved . I can also assure A. E. that the oranges sold in Hackensack are just as ripe as those that are sold in Miami . I also wish to inform him that the ripeness of citrus fruit is subject to Government inspection and packers always test the fruit before it is picked . Citrus fruit ripens before it colors , and to keep the fruit on the trees until it fully colors would mean not only a great loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun-ripened juice to the public . Adding color to the skin of the orange does not in ariway affect the color or taste of the juice . BENJAMIN KUSHNER . Crescent City , Fla. , Dec. 27 , 1946.
