In 1846 , the Northumberland Baptist Association canvassed the hills and valleys of central Pennsylvania by stagecoach , canal boat and horseback , looking for money to start a new school . That fall , with donations given by thrifty churchmen ranging from 25 to $25,000 , * the school that was to become Bucknell University held its first classes-22 students meeting with two professors in the Baptist Church basement in quiet Lewisburg , Pa . <P> For a long while Bucknell 's faculty and students had a hard struggle . At the first commencement in 1851 , seven sheepish seniors took turns wearing the only gown in town , changed costumes behind a screen . But as central Pennsylvania grew , so did the school .

One hundred sixty-six of its 2,400 students received their diplomas , took a farewell glimpse at the spacious 300-acre campus overlooking the Susquehanna Valley .

Bucknell 's ninth president will be ex-Maine Governor Horace A. Hildreth ( Bowdoin ' 25 ) , whose four years in office were distinguished for Yankee thrift in government and for a colorful State Council meeting held on a hunting trip in the Maine woods .
