The Chicago Tribune 's Robert Rutherford ( " Col. M'Cosmic " ) McCormick opened a new fighting front last week . The Colonel 's Chicago Tribune turned on the New York Herald Tribune , which had printed a roundup of the pre-Pearl Harbor opinions-since proved laughable-of " appeasolationists . " Said the Tribune : <P> &gt;The Herald Tribune is selling out America because its proprietor , Ogden Reid , is the brother of Lady Ward , the former Jean Templeton Reid . <P> &gt;The Herald Tribune does n't care what happens to Australia , " because there is n't a society person to be found in the whole continent . " <P> &gt; " The Herald-Tribune is a hyphenated newspaper in more than the typographical sense . Its patriotism is diluted with sea water . " ( The Herald Tribune never has hyphenated its name. )
