The Harmony of Fronts Good news on any front of the world war is good news on all , and when good news from each arrives in a single week , we are entitled to take courage for further effort . The best news of all is the driving of the Germans helter-skelter from Rostov , for this city is indeed the gateway to Caucasus oil ? not for the conquerors , but for the defenders . The Germans could not have got at the Baku wells themselves without a difficult campaign across a mountain range higher than the Alps , but they could at Rostov have cut the Russians ' chief rail connection with these wells . Only less important is the news that the latest heavy German drive has been held short of Moscow , and driven back in places . Just when the Germans can ill afford to withdraw planes or men from these regions , comes the news of the British penetration of Libya , surrounding the Axis forces and cutting their communications . The campaign is not yet won , but already it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will provide a necessary base for further operations in Africa and possibly in Europe as well . No doubt these events affected the Japanese decision not to start a war with the United States and its associates in the Far East , at least not quite yet . They might even have checked somewhat Marshal Petain 's obvious intention to surrender wholly to the Axis , giving Hitler the French navy and the use of Tunisia , Morocco and Dakar . At least , the Fiihrer may find himself in midwinter with nothing but a plate of cold and sour Vichyssoise . Glass Jaw ? Landing a punch on the outthrust German chin at Rostov , the first solid one that the Nazi army has had to take in more than two years of war , Marshal Timoshenko also dropped the propaganda bureau of the German High Command to the mat . The best that the army 's spokesmen could do in their surprise was to pretend that the evacuation was made voluntarily , " to permit German forces to carry out reprisals against the city 's civilian population . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . German firing squads never before found it necessary to back away thirty miles in a day in order to shoot civilians . The Nazi military dictatorship is magnificently trained to win battles . The superman 's glass jaw may be the inability to know how to lose one . Family Affair An atmosphere of " cordial courtesy " is said to have surrounded the meeting of Marshals Petain and Goering . Reports from Vichy emphasize Goering 's tactful manner , his polite dusting-off of the hot seat . It was not confirmed in Berlin that the meeting of marshals had any bearing on French naval assistance in the Mediterranean ; if general questions of collaboration were all that came up , the meeting can not be considered of prime importance . If , as seems likely , use of the French navy and African ports was the chief subject , Petain was in a position to demand far more in return than was previously the case . It would be foolish to expect that his bargaining was of a kind that was favorable to the Allies : Petain has committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conciliate French opinion by gaining popular national concessions such as the release of French prisoners and the reduction of occupation costs . On their side , the Germans , pressed as they are , must do their best to retain the whip hand for subsequent meetings . It is a family affair in which we should place no hope on past loyalties . Democracy Wins a Battle The whole country will be delighted by the peaceful settlement of the railroad wage dispute . It will not be so unanimous , though it ought to be , in approving a larger increase of wages than the President 's Emergency Fact-Finding Board originally recommended . All parties to the dispute apparently evinced a statesmanship that was lacking , except on the part of the President , in the captive-coal-mine strike . The last thing the unions wanted was a strike at this time , and the next to the last thing was destruction of the mediation machinery which they had helped to erect and which has operated well in the past . The board itself was not too inflexible to revise its former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad managements , if they had been like the steel operators , might have stood pat and let the workers take the onus of a strike . The new agreement differs from the original recommendations in two respects ; first , it augments the hourly wage increases ( after one day , for the sake of the board 's dignity , we suppose , at the formerly recommended rates ) ; second , and more important , it does not make the increase a temporary one which expires automatically in a year . The headlines tell us that the award will cost the roads $300,000,000 ; they do not tell us that the railmen 's pay has been stationary for years while the rest of labor has been advancing , that efficiency and unit labor costs have been markedly reduced , and that now at last the roads have plenty of traffic . If subsequently the managements fall on hard times again and can not pay , the obligation on the country will be to proceed with the long overdue reorganization of our transportation system rather than to insist that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time in peace since 1789 , Americans have been convicted of sedition on the basis of their opinions . A federal jury in Minneapolis acquitted the twenty-three defendants , members of the Socialist Workers ' Party and the Teamsters ' Union , Local 544 , CIO , of the charges of seditious conspiracy to overthrow the government by force , which were brought against them in June of this year , but held eighteen of them guilty of disseminating propaganda to create insubordination in the armed forces of the . government and to advocate force and violence against the government . As The New Republic pointed out in an article by Daniel Eastman ( October 2o ) , the evidence that these people had engaged in overt acts tending to overthrow the government was so feeble that it was necessary to look in some other direction for the possible motive of the United States Attorney General in instituting the prosecution . The New Republic noted the coincidence that this local had been formed after a break with the AFL Teamsters ' Union led by Dan Tobin , and that Tobin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some way pre . vented from pursuing this dangerous course . " The arrests were made two weeks later . The Minneapolis jury found no proof of overt acts , but held that the expression of opinions in print by the members of the Trotskyist party constituted sedition . Under the Smith Act of 1940 the defendants can be sentenced to terms up to ten years . The Civil Rights Defense Committee , in conjunction with the American Civil Liberties Union , is planning an appeal . The precedent of conviction for opinion in print is a most disturbing and unfortunate one , as the country stands on the verge of war and wartime emotions and intolerance mount . Private Enterprise , or Housing The House Public Buildings and Grounds Committee , of which Representative Lanham of Texas is chairman , has said that real-estate men should be " enticed " into supplying homes for the men who are building tanks and planes for the country 's defense . It tried to entice them through Title VI of the National Housing Act , which guaranteed them against loss in private-home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worker . That has not remotely begun to provide the necessary dwellings for the two million or so people who have changed their abodes at the demands of the defense program , as all disinterested experts and all governmental housing authorities now agree , including Housing CoOrdinator Palmer , who is a former real-estate operator and has not been too cordial to public housing . The President asked for $300,000,000 more last July , to build homes for 75,00o families . It was not nearly enough , but not even that has been appropriated . Defense housing should be rental housing . The government must build it . Rents should be frozen . Communities should be planned as wholes , with due regard for sewers , water supply and other utilities , and for schools and recreation areas . Those are the principles on which a sound housing program must be based . The Times on the Air Radio listeners who are weary of having hair tonic and chewing gum rubbed into their news broadcasts will welcome the arrival of The New York Times on the air . News broadcasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over WMCA every hour on the hour from 8 A. M. through II P. M. on weekdays and at four periods on Sundays . In charge of the broadcasts is one of The Times 's most experienced men , and the bulletins are written with that regard for accuracy and dignity which has made The Times an indispensable newspaper . One innovation is to open each broadcast , which runs for three or four minutes , with the most important news item of the moment and then repeat it at the closing . There is no sales . talk as such , and The Times 's name is mentioned only twice . Unless they have powerful receivers , listeners outside the New York area will probably be unable to hear the bulletins . But the influence of The Times 's program , a model of newscasting , may travel far . Radio advertisers should take note . People 7 , Opponents 0 New York 's great backfield , Roosevelt , Wagner and Lehman ( Al Smith still out with an injury ) , carried the bail once more in the fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the people and not merely that of the utility companies . A new federal aluminum plant is being built at Massena , New York , near the St. Lawrence River . Power must be carried to it from the New York City area . The State Power Authority wanted the transmission line owned by the state , as part of the state 's public-power system . Governor Lehman and Senator Wagner backed the Authority in its demand . President Roosevelt and the Federal Power Commission approved . The army will build the line , mapping the route by air , since speed is important . The project will pay for itself , and since it will be built on the west bank of the Hudson and will not run through Van Cortlandt Park , as the private utilities wanted it to , it will be an integral part of the New Jer749 sey-Pennsylvania power pool . When the St. Lawrence development is authorized and completed , it will carry I , Ioo , 000 horsepower of cheap electricity back to the consumers of the district . The people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Touchdown . Friends of the Refugee The New Republic last week praised the work of the Emergency Rescue Committee , which has saved hundreds of men and women from fascism in Europe and which is now staging a drive for additional funds . This week we should like to call attention to the work of the International Relief Association , long a friend of the refugee . Since it was set up in April , 1933 , immediately after Hitler took power , the IRA has cared for some 3,000 refugees , many of whom would certainly have perished by the Fascist sword without the organization 's help . From September , 1940 , through August , 1941 , the IRA spent $55,300 on relief and rescue work ; only 4.2 percent of that sum went to administration . The International Relief Association is now staging a new drive for funds . Its address is 2 West Forty-third Street , New York City . Snatching victims from the Fascist jaws is a task of paramount importance and vast dimensions . We commend the IRA 's part in that task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know how Chicagoans feel about the name Marshall Field chose for his new daily ? it 's The Sun ? but we do know of a New Yorker who thinks it 's unfortunate . He is an executive of a book-publishing firm , and he is in sympathy with Mr. Field 's progressive ideas . So much in sympathy that he arranged to have a best-selling novel on his fall list advertised in The Sun 's first issue . After arrangements were made , it suddenly occurred to him that that particular novel would n't do for Mr. Field 's forthcoming first number . Its title was " The Sun Is My Undoing , " and its author , regrettably , was not Colonel McCormick . Last Week The horrors of war were crowded into the front pages of the newspapers by the approaching horrors of Christmas , which monopolized the other forty-seven pages in most dailies . In the words of the copywriter for L. Bomberger and Company , Market and Halsey Streets , Newark , " a glow spread over the country , warm and hazy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unforgettable Amber , a ' perfume for a personality , of monogrammed suspenders , which were on sale at the smarter shops , and of heat from the typewriters in the advertising agencies . Prince and Princess Gourielli want you to stop and have a cup of tea any afternoon at four that you are in New York , at their new shop at 16 East Fifty-fifth Street . " There is nothing in all New York this Christmas quite like Prince and Princess Gourielli 's new shop . " You will find hair and scalp preparations there , as well as marriage chests from Mexico , if you want a marriage chest from Mexico . . . . If you want a mink coat you can get one at Lord and Taylor 's from $1,095 up , and if you want fabulous footstools , which are shoes with six-inch heels and exotic fruits on silver kid , you can get them at Bergdorf Goodman 's . You can get Christmas cards anywhere and you 've got to do it , no matter how much it hurts . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 're on the horns of a dilemma . " The promised shortage of cellophane is n't the only simplification that war may contribute to the horrors of peace .
