SALSETTE DISCOVERS AMERICA-Jules Remains-Knopf ( $2.50 ) . <P> This book , by the tireless fabricator of Men of Good Will , is not one of the series ; it is a graceful little vacation-piece on the old subject of The Visiting Foreigner . This time the foreigner is no charmer of women 's clubs but a likable middle-aged Frenchman , the exiled professor Albert Salsette . He gets to Manhattan in the spring of 1941 , and his old friend Jules Remains shows him around . They see little of that world outside Greater New York . But as far as they go , their sharp eyes , fresh minds and Gallic talent for analysis and for phrase contrive a keenly agreeable pair of new spectacles for the over-habituated native . <P> " You feel so unmistakably , " Salsette remarks , " that nobody here is afraid . Yes , that 's what it is ! Immense power ; and with it immense freedom . Is n't it perfectly astounding that the two should go together ? " <P> But he is by no means myopic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a kind of serenely confident ostentation " ; he notes too that they are bold with their eyes in the streets , and the men shy , almost to a reversal of sex . To him the well-known myth about the dominant American female is incorrect ; " it seems to me rather the cult of woman , a little in the spirit of the troubadours . ... " When Remains explains to him that American men , though you may talk with them freely about the French or Chinese or Tahitian , have " a curious-and in a way admirable and touching-sense of modesty about their own women , " he exclaims : " But in that case they are a wonderful race , these men ! They have other gods besides their money and their work . " <P> M. Salsette 's remarks about U.S. food &; drink are courteous but not startlingly novel ; he has some very nice things to say , however , for the complicated , charming toy , his kitchenette , and he manages to make the luxuries of a U.S. bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> In a brilliant set piece , Romains leads him into the deafening shadows of Manhattan 's Chatham Square , for an infernal glimpse of the U.S. " Middle Ages . " Later , in " the hypnotic rhythm " of a Parkway drive to Jones Beach , they move on a road so magnificently designed that it makes a car " an instrument capable of making a landscape sing " ; among many other cars in " an incredibly vast dance , " as if some all-but-cosmic power had caught a whole race into planetary motion . <P> Salsette and his guide are kinder than natives might be , but they are honest . One realizes , in Salsette 's summation , a deep genuineness , an almost embarrassing tribute . " This is what I call a materialistic civilization , " he exclaims . " And I like it .
