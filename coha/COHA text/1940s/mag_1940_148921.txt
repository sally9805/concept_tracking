Charlie Chaplin 's " Production No. 6 , " known to everybody in Hollywood as The Dictator , will soon be ready for exhibitors . In spite of Chaplin secrecy , news has long since leaked out that The Dictator is a story of a mistaken identity , in which a battered little man in a concentration camp ( Charlie Chaplin ) and his Fhrer ( Charlie Chaplin ) exchange places . But until last week no photograph of Chaplin as a burlesque Hitler had yet been released . <P> One day last fortnight in Manhattan , LIFE 'S editors wrote Producer Chaplin a letter , told him they were publishing a picture of Actor Chaplin in uniform , wearing the insignia of his mythical totalitarian state - a double cross . Last week , two days after LIFE 'S letter reached the Chaplin studio , 48 hours before LIFE was due on newsstands , Chaplin lawyers turned up in a U. S. district court , slapped down a suit for $1,000,000 damages , got an injunction restraining LIFE from publishing Dictator Chaplin 's picture . To news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not included in the in junction . In the 1,112,625 copies still to be distributed , LIFE 'S editors substituted a news shot of Henry Ford inspecting Army pursuit planes . <P> Said Charlie Chaplin 's attorney in an affidavit to the court : " By the proposed and threatened publication . . . the reasonable expectation of over $5,000,000 in profits may be greatly jeopardized . . . . " Said LIFE : " The picture . . . was published because it was . . . of national interest at this time . . . . Although Mr. Chaplin 's attorney admitted in court that LIFE 'S letter had been received . . . at a time when the change could have been made without enormous trouble . . . it was not until this morning that LIFE was advised that a court action was to take place .
