The shabby little church stood just off a dirt road four miles southeast of rural Pimento , Ind . Rain dripped through the ceiling , and the wind worried at the rags and papers stuffed into broken window panes . Squirrels scuttled in &; out of the root , and the lights no longer worked . For the ten or 15 oldsters in their 703 or beyond who persisted in coming to worship at the Methodist Church 's down-at-heel Fletcher Chapel , there was a plain choice : fix up or give up . That was four years ago . <P> Last week , in the late Indiana summer , 65-year-old Fletcher Chapel stood as firm as its surrounding maples and oaks-still a modest roadside church , but a strengthened landmark in the rural heartland of U.S. religion. * <P> Wax &; Wallpaper . After years of patching and making-do , the little church had finally had a major overhauling . As he arrived to lead the rededication service , the Rev. Samuel W. Robinson , superintendent of the 110 churches in the Methodists ' Vmcennes District , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waxed pews and on baskets of asters , zinnias and chrysanthemums . There were new cream-colored walls , a sturdy upright piano , and new runners on the aisles . Crisp new hymnals filled the racks . <P> When the morning service was over the women , in their Sunday-best print dresses , bustled off to the new basement to fix a country-style dinner . Meanwhile , Brother Robinson heard the quarterly progress reports on the three churches-Fletcher Chapel , Ebenezer Church and Pimento Church that make up 35-year-old Rev. Eldon O. Gourley 's Pimento circuit . <P> Sunday school attendance , said Brother Gourley , had jumped 20% and the turnout for services was better , too . " We 're running 35 to 45 worshipers at Fletcher on Sunday , 65 at Ebenezer and 50 at Pimento . The three district churches had raised more than $2,000 for such improvements as the Ebenezer 's new electric organ , an oil furnace and wallpaper for the parsonage . <P> Great Hopes . Business over , the menfolk went downstairs to the long tables loaded with fried chicken , beef pork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mashed , baked and roasted ; a variety of salads , vegetables , muts , cakes and pies . Everybody ate hearty , and what was left went home with the women . <P> The church still owed $200 on its $2,700 worth of overhauling , but a $50 donation started off a collection that briskly raised enough to cover the debt and put an extra 40 into the fund for an oil heater . Brother Robinson glowed . Finances were looking up and the young people were again taking an interest in church . Brother Gourley ran his eyes proudly over the chapel as the late afternoon sun flooded through its new windows . Said he : " We have great hopes " <P> <P> * Methodists , who outnumber any other Protestant group in the U.S. , maintain 60% of their 40,397 churches in small communities with congregations of fewer than 300 members
