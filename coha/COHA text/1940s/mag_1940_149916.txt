" This is the highest and most solemn moment of our war , " Italy 's chief labor newspaper , Lavoro Fascista , said last week . " The time has come to say to our open and hidden enemies that we have never been prouder of being Italians and Fascisti . . . . That goes also for those Italians who are falser than Greek money and , doubly bastardized , who have not the heart to hold out to victory and who are not worthy of it . With them , fortunately , the accounting is near . " <P> In such passages as this , rather than in the censored dispatches of foreign correspondents , could be read the true picture of Italy last week . Correspondents cabled that news of British victories in Egypt was withheld in Italy , that prices of necessities had almost doubled , that sometimes housewives " get impatient " waiting in queues for rations of charcoal and olive oil . But on the growing social unrest in Italy they could only quote the papers . <P> This unrest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was displayed chiefly by the well-to-do and the fairly well-to-do , those elements which have always been , at best , lukewarm supporters of Fascism . They are the elements which have been most loyal to King Vittorio Emanuele , who at the time of the Ethiopian crisis was supposed to have said : " If Italy wins , I will be Emperor of Ethiopia but if Italy loses , I will be King of Italy . " He may have been thinking along the same lines last week . There were rumors that Crown Prince Umberto had offered to resign the Army command he shared with Marshal Badoglio , that II Duce had refused his resignation . <P> Against this opposition zealous Fascists demanded violence . " This war has assumed all the characteristics of a political and social revolution , " wrote Popolo di Roma , proposing " some beatings-up " for those who read the French-language Swiss press . " These are the prophets of disaster , the professional alarmists , the convinced pessimists , the empty brains and the sour stomachs who still exist among us here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to jettison " the remaining petty bourgeois ballast , " Popolo di Roma suggested that nothing remained but to begin . <P> To the fore again came that Fascist firebrand , Roberto Farinacci , onetime Secretary General of the Fascist Party and now editor of Regime Fascista and the monthly La Vita d'ltalia . He accused Badoglio of " frequenting salons , hunting preserves and groups which received favors from him , saying he did not favor the Greek undertaking . " As to rising prices , Editor Farinacci demanded : " With things increasing at this rate , are wages and salaries to remain unaltered ? ... Is there anyone who imagines that profiteers have disappeared while the mass of the people are submitting to limitation in their standard of living ? " <P> Italian anger at Italians had grown so violent that there was little vigor left to damn the British . Example ( from an Italian broadcast ) : " The Italian is a light-hearted and easygoing fellow until he is aroused . . . . The British ought to remember this . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
