By JOHN H. CRIDER Special to THE Netv YORK Tetra . WASHINGTON , July 26 ? Willliam S. Knudsen , member of the National Advisory Defense Commission in charge of production , reported at a press conference today progress on all fronts in the organization of industry for defense , but struck a sobering note when he cautioned that it takes time to gear industry for the mass production of war materials which the nation expectantly awaits . Mr. Knudsen emphasized , in his " progress report " on his eight weeks of action , that " with the continued cooperation of industry and the interested government agencies , we can be confident of a production machine capable of attaining the definite goal specifically stated in the request now before Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . " Almost simultaneously an important step in rounding out the aircraft engine phase of the industrial expansion program was disclosed with an announcement by Jesse H. Jones , Federal Loan Administrator , of a loan of $92,000,000 to the Wright Aeronautical Corporation for construction of a huge new plant in Hamilton County , Ohio , to add 12,000 motors per year to the aircraft engine industry 's capacity for producing radial air-cooled engines . Engine Program Is Revised Mr. Jones disclosed that the War Department had revised its program so that a previously planned loan of $55,500,000 to the Wright company had been increased to the new figure . Mr. Knudsen , meeting the press in the club-like library of the Federal Reserve Board governors , made public the first official figures on the current rate of military aircraft production , stating that the August schedule called for delivery of 895 complete combat and large transport commercial planes ( usable for troop transport in emergency ) during August . Of these , 396 will be delivered to the Army and Navy , 236 to the British Government , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transports going for domestic use , and five planes unclassified . Injecting the realism of a production expert into a subject upon which there has bees . considerable optimistic speculation , Mr. Knudsen declared that the total output of the aircraft industry on a monthly basis , including the planes now on order by Great Britain , would not reach 3,000 deliveries per month until the middle of 1942 . These figures are only for military and large transport planes , the estimate not including small planes for private flying . Program for British Discussed Regarding the projected British program to purchase 3,000 planes per month , a total of 72,000 planes during the years 1941 and 1942 , Mr. Knudsen declared that he had been // KNUDSEN REPORTS DEFENSE PROGRESS // asked only to make a quick cost estimate , which he expected to have by tomorrow afternoon . To superimpose this new program on top of the present domestic and foreign aircraft program , he said , would entail the construction of at least thirty-eight new plants . He said that if the program were put under way immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule until possibly the end of 1941 , and even in 1942 probably would never get as many as 3,000 completed planes with engines per month . , Earlier in the day Mr. Knudsen , accompanied by Edward R. Stettinius Jr. , commission member in charge of raw materials , urged a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee to speed passage of the $4,800,000,000 Defense Deficiency Bill . They testified that the recent amendment of the Vinson-Trammell act to cut profits on ships and aircraft to 8 per cent had discouraged many suit-contractors from participating in the defense program , bur the committee indicated that quick action on the proposed Excess Profits Bill to supplant the Profit Limitations should take care of that . Shipyards Will Re Expanded Other important developments reported by Mr. Knudsen both orally and in his written statement were : 1 . Because of the complete cooperation of the machine-tool industry , it will not he necessary to enforce a priority system of deliveries in order to assure the machine tool items essential to the defense program . 2 . Five shipyards on the Pacific and Gulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naval building program . 3 . The Packard Motor Car Company is making ready to go into production on 9,000 Rolls Royce airplane engines , although contracts have not yet been signed . 4 . The Allison Division of General Motors Corporation , manufacturer of the only liquid-cooled , highhorsepower aircraft engine in the United States , is scheduled to produce 130 of the engines in August and by November will be turning out 400 a month . 5 . The Ford Motor Company has offered its facilities , but . nothing has been found for it to make . How- , ever , Mr. Knudsen emphasized that : , to the Ford concern had been n ffered the 9.000-engine order now to he undertaken by Packard , which order the Ford company rejected . 6 . From June 6 to July 25 the office of Mr. Knudsen has cleared $315,288,152.08 of Army contracts and $1,412,907,677.87 for the Navy . a. total of $1,728,195,829.25 , all of which have been signed . 7 . While orders have already been placed for the first of the Army 's light tanks , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vital information gleaned from experience in the European war . " 8 . Confirming an earlier report by Dr. George Me ? the commission 's aircraft engine expert , Mr. Knudsen stated that " there is every indication that the industry will he able to meet the heavy requirements placed upon it under the program calling for annual production of 25 , - 000 complete aircraft ( engines and armor ) by July 1 , 1942. " 9 . No serious problem was found to exist in small-arms production , and one arsenal will he turning out 500 Garland automatic rifles daily by Oct. 1 . Avoids Comment on Ford Mr. Knudsen remarked that he was nothing but " an adding machine " in connection with the proposed British plane order for 3,000 additional units per month , and when asked about the British ability to pay he said : " You 'll have to see Mr. Morganthan about that . I 'm not the cash department , " To build the thirty-eight . plants necessary to fill this order would take from six to eleven months , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibilities which he had outlined did not disagree with statements of Henry Ford , and replied that it was not for him to judge that . He requested that the Ford incident be consid -- ered closed . Mr. Ford some time ago predicted that he could , minus government red tape , turn out some 1,000 aircraft a day . Mr. Knudsen stated that , for himself , he did not recognize the phrase " red tape . " However , he stated that the task in which he was now engaged differed in some respects from private business . " You 've got different things to contend with , ' ' he said . " For one thing , there 's the matter of legal procedure  --  you 've got to do things just a certain way , and you 've got to get the money , and there are things like that amortization ( the writing-off of new plant costs against depreciation ) which Congress has promised to clear up . " " I 'm frank to say , " he added , " that amortization was a drawback . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the law , and I 'm going to proceed that way . There should n't be any reason why business men should n't undertake government orders as well as any other orders . We 'll try to get everything out of their way . " Asked if he had sufficient authority , he replied that he did n't " need any " because " we act , through the regular agencies . " He said that there had been no lac* of cooperation from the government . Mr. Knudsen clarified the question of how Mr. Stettinius and he divided their dutie% by stating that when they first came to Washington he told his colleague , who has charge of material supply : " You bring it to the shop door , and I 'll cut it up . " Discounts Reports of Thefts When questioned regarding reported thefts of strategically important machine tools at New York and elsewhere , Mr. Knudsen said that he had not heard about it , " hut I do n't imagine you could steal enough to get us in any trouble , and , anyhow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that he was meeting the defense manufacturing contractors and potential contractors next , Tuesday and was confident that they could be persuaded to go ahead with contracts on the assurance that the problem of depreciation would he taken care of by Congress . Authority to charge off costs to depreciation over a fiveyear period will be contained in the excess profits tax bill soon to he introduced in Congress . The commission announced that a complete list of all defense contractors to date , with some details as to their contracts , would he made public early next week . Donald M.
