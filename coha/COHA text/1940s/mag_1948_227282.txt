The Silver Whistle ( by Robert McEnroe ; produced by the Theatre Guild ) tells how a spacious liar and accomplished charlatan rejuvenates an old folks ' home . A 47-year-old hobo , Oliver Erwenter ( Jos Ferrer ) poses as a superbly virile codger of 77 and passes out to the men folk a magical aphrodisiac ( actually , small bread pellets ) . He tells lordly yarns of foreign travel and female conquest ; makes flamboyant love to a young lady employed at the home ; and with a bit of help , swipes the equipment and supplies for a rousing charity bazaar . Though the truth about him gradually leaks out and he himself at last goes away , his rosy swindle continues to bear fruit . <P> A sadly uneven affair , The Silver Whistle is all the same a pleasantly unusual one . There may be nothing new about the theme ( which is simply that people crave illusions , that while there 's hope there 's life ) , but the particulars are often fresh and lively . Mildly Saroyanesque throughout and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes The Silver Whistle is genuinely funny , whether from the hobo 's taradiddles or from dodderers who , with one foot in the grave , suddenly kick up commotion with the other . <P> Unhappily the hobo 's gift of the gab makes him tedious as well as fascinating ; and the elderly capers , if picturesque at times , at other times turn rancid . Obviously pleased with his own joke , Playwright McEnroe sometimes lets it run on too long , sometimes lets it go too far . What tremendously braces The Silver Whistle 's very shaky charm is Jos Ferrer 's very assured performance . A master of florid roles , a born Cyrano de Bergeractor , Ferrer spouts and yarnspins with an air , never trades tinseled make-believe for drab reality . <P> <P> The Young and Fair ( by N. Richard Nash ; produced by Vinton Freedley in association with Richard Krakeur ) deals with life at a fashionable junior college for girls . And there 's considerable life to deal with , for behind its trim ivied walls Brook Valley harbors more problems than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school ( Frances Starr ) who would like to serve God but is forced to serve Mammon , to the student ( Lois Wheeler ) who lacks the courage to admit she is Jewish , people are harassed and torn two ways . All this ( and kleptomania too ) catches the eye of a bullying , power-hungry student ( Doe Avedon ) , a rich trustee 's daughter who , when she can not command , can only conspire . Like the brat in The Children 's Hour , she twists and messes up lives , but in this case things get straightened out before the end . <P> The Young and Fair has a real sense of how thorny and bewildering life can be : an endless emotional seesaw , a constant moral crossroads . It understands , too , how snobbish institutions like Brook Valley help strangle decent impulses . Unfortunately it has not let bad enough alone , but has gone at ticklish human problems with the red hot pincers of melodrama , and has so loaded itself down with wiles and theatrics that it finally caves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no real plight ; the words , like the deeds , smack at times of garish melodrama . <P> But The Young and Fair , though a botch , is by no means a bore . There is always far too much happening , far too much threatening . And an all-female cast acts the play to the hilt-and at moments quite convincingly .
