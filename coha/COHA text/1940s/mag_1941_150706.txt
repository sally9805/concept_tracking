In the 1 6th Century Explorer Jacques Cartier told his monarch in France that the Saguenay River in Quebec flowed through a land of gold and rubies , oranges and almonds , wherein dwelt men with no digestive organs , square bodies , and only one leg . Almost as unbelievable , for a modern nation at war , was the story last week , also from Saguenay , of how most of Canada 's aluminum industry had been put out of action for weeks to come . The stoppage occurred at the $150,000,000 Aluminium , Ltd. plant at Arvida which , using cheap water power to process ship-borne bauxite ore from British Guiana , is now turning out enough ingot aluminum for 50,000 airplanes a year , and has become the second biggest single aluminum-production center in the Western Hemi sphere. * <P> " Organized . . . sabotage , " roared crusty , New England-born Clarence Decatur Howe , Minister of Munitions and Supply . <P> " Not a labor dispute in any sense , " opined Canadian Minister of Labor Norman McLarty , who backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of Canada 's Treachery Act , with its death-penalty clause . <P> The situation , so far as it became known after censorship had held up the story for five days : <P> The trouble started in the " pot room " ( final stage of aluminum reduction ) . Irked by the sweltering heat and the inaction of the company and the National Catholic Syndicate of Aluminum Workers on requested wage increases , 300 huskies quit work and set up a shout for " a dollar an hour . " They tossed out protesting " front-office " workers , told company police to go chase themselves . In violation of Canada 's labor-conciliation law they staged a sit-down in the pot room , thereby capturing a plant surrounded by anti-aircraft batteries , as carefully guarded against outside attack as any in North America . <P> Government troops , ordered on the bounce from Valcartier in Bren gun-carriers , did not arrive for four days because municipal and provincial authorities contested the Government 's legal right to intercede . When the troops did show up , a worried priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who then moved out peacefully . <P> Two days later all 5,000 regular plant employes and 4,000 sympathizing construction workers , who were building new plant units , returned to work . Conferences began between the Syndicate and the company to discuss wage adjustments . Meanwhile the aluminum had solidified in the pots . Special crews started a three-week job of chipping it out . Before the plant could get going again Canada would have lost thousands of tons of aluminum production , much of which was earmarked for U.S. airplane factories . <P> <P> - Biggest : Alcoa 's at Alcoa , Tenn.
