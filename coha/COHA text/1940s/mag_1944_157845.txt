Captains and kings urged their men to battle and their people to pray for victory . President Roosevelt led the U.S. in a prayer he had written in the days &; nights before the invasion : <P> " Almighty God : our sons , pride of our nation , this day have set upon a mighty endeavor , a struggle to preserve our republic , our religion , and our civilization , and to set free a suffering humanity . Lead them straight and true ; give strength to their arms , stoutness to their hearts , steadfastness to their faith . . . . The enemy . . . may hurl back our forces . But we shall return again and again ; and we know that by Thy grace . . . our sons will triumph . <P> " Some will never return . Embrace these , Father , and receive them , Thy heroic servants , into Thy Kingdom . . . . <P> " With Thy blessing , we shall prevail ... Lead us to the saving of our country , and with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure peace . . . . " <P> As the Allied troops headed for the French shore , their commanders read them the Order of the Day from General Dwight Eisenhower : <P> " You are about to embark upon a great crusade . . . . We will accept nothing less than full victory . " <P> King George VI , broadcasting to the people of his empire and commonwealth , spoke a measured , modest plea : " I desire solemnly to call my people to prayer and dedication . We are not unmindful of our own shortcomings . We shall ask not that God may do our will but that we may do the will of God , and we dare to believe that God has used our nation and empire as an instrument for fulfilling His highest purpose . " <P> Winston Churchill , appearing before a cheering House of Commons , tantalizingly devoted 650 words to the fall of Rome . Then he added jubilantly : " I have also to announce to the House that during the night and early hours of the morning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European continent has taken place . So far , the commanders . . . report that everything is proceeding according to plan . And what a plan ! " Several hours later , he was an even happier warrior : " There is very much less loss than we expected . . . . Many dangers . . . are behind us . This operation is proceeding in a thoroughly satisfactory manner . "
