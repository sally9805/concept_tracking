The rarefied air of high office in U.S. industry has often been considered too thin for women to stand . Last week , the staid old Standard Oil Co . ( New Jersey ) broke this antifeminine taboo . Into two of its five executive posts of assistant secretary it raised two ex-stenographers : brown-eyed , brown-haired Miss Muriel E. Reynolds , 42 , and small ( 5 ft. i in . ) Mrs. Margery M. Porter , also 42 , who wears her brown hair in a feather cut . They are the first women ever to become corporate officers in mighty Standard . <P> Standard 's prettiest executives have both been working since they were children . Miss Reynolds , a native of Waterbury , Conn. , was a bank clerk at 15 . She worked her way through Wheaton College , taught junior high school just long enough ( one year ) to decide she did not like it , settled down as a stenographer in Standard 's accounting department 19 years ago . <P> Mrs. Porter packed manicuring sets and sold Christmas cards while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an actress but decided it was " too unsteady . " After graduating from high school she did nine years of clerical work for the National Society of Penal Information , finding jobs For ex-convicts . In 1930 she went to work as a stenographer in Standard 's sales department . <P> As Assistant Secretaries , the new executives , like their predecessors , will have little to do with policy matters , will be primarily concerned with keeping records . Neither has a success formula for girls who want to make the long climb from hot kitchen to air-conditioned office-except ambition . Said Mrs. Porter : " It has been wonderful , though , to see the effect our appointment has had on the other women of the company . It has given them all renewed hope . . . . It 's a milestone for women in the conservative man 's world . "
