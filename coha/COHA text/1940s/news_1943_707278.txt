txt The Office of Price Administration prepared tonight to enforce its latest gasoline order , which reduces the value of coupons in the Midwest and Southwest but continuing the Northeastern pleasure-driving ban until Sept. 1 , amid growing indications that the new regulations pleased practically no one . The OPA instructed its regional and district boards in twelve Northeastern States to continue enforcement of the pleasure-driving ban , with the aid of State and local police , for the next two weeks . At the same time officials reiterated the warning of the ORA. general manager , Chester Bowles , that failure of motorists to obey the ban would inevitably result in its extension beyond Sept. 1 . The OPA appeared to have a major enforcement problem cut  --  out for it , in not only the Northeast , but also the Midwestern and Southwestern States , where the value , of A , B and C coupons will be cut at 12:01 A. M. Monday from four to three gallons . It was reported that special enforcement attention in the newly restricted areas would be paid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph B. Eastman , defense transportation director , said that the May 27 emergency order curtailing bus and taxicab mileage in the Eastern shortage area by 20 per cent would be revoked , effective Monday . Some 30,000 buses and 23,000 cabs in twelve Northeastern States , the District of Columbia and the eight Eastern counties of West Virginia will be affected . Mr. Eastman said that the lifting of the restrictions was made possible by a 14,000-barrel-a-day increase in the Eastern gasoline allotment ordered by Secretary Ickes , Petroleum Administrator for War . Strong criticism of the new regulations came from members of Congress , many of whom contended that curtailment of gasoline supplies for the Midwest and Southwest should have brought immediate suspension of the Northeastern pleasure-driving ban or , failing that , should not have been ordered at all . Senator George D. Aiken of Vermont said : " We 've been getting promises and so-called assurances for months ; what we - ant now is a definite order , signed and promulgated . " Calls Promise Unsatisfactory " As a matter of fact , " he added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are doing a job on them . This new promise is entirely unsatisfactory . " Representative Louis Ludlow of Indiana said that people of the Middle West " do n't understand it . " " There does n't seem to be any point in cutting down the Midwest gas unless it is to help the Eastern situation , " he added , " and there has been no indication that it will . The order seems ill-advised and I believe it should never have been issued . " Senator Theodore F. Green of Rhode Island predicted that the OPA 's " backing and filling " would produce widespread disobedience of its orders . " I do n't believe the people will try to obey the pleasure ban now that they know it is going to be lifted , " he said . The only Congressional voice heard here in approval of the order was that of Representative Sol Bloom of New York , who said the order " is extremely fair and equitable . " He said : " There is no question but that the new restriction ( in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Coast . "
