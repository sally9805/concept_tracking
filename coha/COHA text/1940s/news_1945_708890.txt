PELL.MURRAY Letters to The Times Alternatives for Britain Either World Must Buy More From Her Or She Must Buy Less To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Some important Americans apparently believe that American financial aid should not , without the most substantial safeguards , be used to bolster up a British economy , which is supposedly about to collapse under the impact of state socialism . It is , of course , obvious that the use of American financial resources , both as to direction and as to terms , rests entirely with Americans . It would be as foolish and as futile for a British citizen to offer advice on those questions as it would be for Americans to attempt to influence policy in other democracies by any form of financial inducement . Experience shows that such excursions are likely to defeat their objects . But may I , as a non-Socialist member of the British middle class , offer a single observation ? It appears to me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our ears only as an American conception , would have exactly the same purpose under a Labor Government as it would have done if Mr. Churchill 's Government had not been destroyed . Main Purpose Stated That purpose , as I understand it , is not to promote the financing of schemes of nationalization within the bounds of the United Kingdom but to enable Britain to obtain from abroad raw materials and new equipment so that her industries may once more participate in the trade of the world . From an American point of view that is a goal which may or may not be desirable . The determining factor will presumably be a calculation as to where the true self-interest of the United States rests , i. e. , with a relatively prosperous , high-standard Britain , or with a struggling , impoverished Britain , able to make only a modest claim upon the goods and services of the outside world . The issue can hardly be affected by domestic changes in the ownership structure of some basic elements in the British economy , with a consequent transformation of shareholders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case a small thing compared with the real revolution which the war has already made in Britain 's commercial position by depriving her of a great proportion of her overseas assets and imposing upon her a sterling debt publicly stated to exceed $12,000,000,000 . Readjustment Necessary Clearly this will necessitate a violent adjustment by Britain  --  but it will also exact a hardly less difficult adjustment 2rom countries which have enjoyed a good market here for their exports . About half of Britain 's imports before the war were paid for by exports . The remainder were met out of the proceeds of overseas investment and the earnings of shipping and other services . Such a situation can no longer obtain . Either Britain will be forced to buy less from the world or the world will agree to buy more from Britain . The first alternative points straight to a lower standard of life and , in particular , to a reduction in British purchases of luxury and semitluxury goods . It involves a restrictive , austere , belt-tightening economy and , in the wider aspect , a tendency toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a middle-class citizen , brought up in a Liberal tradition , with an ingrained respect for a free world economy and a multilateral trading system , I hope that we shall be able to avoid this somber alternative . But it is not easy for a nation , stripped by war of her resources , to resume , with any confidence , the broad and ample commercial outlook of her more prosperous days . It is against this background that  --  I should have thought  --  the question of " financial aid for , Britain " could more relevantly be considered . GEORGE MALCOLM TnomsoN . London , Aug. 20 , 1945 . Minimum Wage Lift Opposed Several Proposed Bills , in Fact , Are Regarded With Suspicion To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Are we a nation of economic illiterates ? It would seem so from the number of what might be called wishfulthinking bills which are about to be introduced , whose main purpose is to guarantee and insure , if Philip Murray of the CIO has his way , the abundant life to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is already worn thin by an enormous debt of $262,000 , - 000,000 . The remarkable thing about these bills is that they do not provide for the funds which will be needed to carry out their provisions . Neither is there any estimate of what they will cost , it being taken apparently for granted that the Government has funds available other than those it takes from the taxpayers . In the recent announcement of the new curriculum at Yale it was stated that its main purpose was to emphasize in the freshman year " the laws and principles which operate in our natural world . " Our Founding Fathers were well aware of these laws and principles , especially as they applied to economics , and we adhered to them generally until the advent of the New Deal , which introduced the idea that the laws of economics can be manipulated so as to secure the abundant life for all . As a matter of fact , are they not as inviolable as the laws of nature , say the raw of gravity , the only difference being that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while a violation of , say , the law of supply and demand may not manifest itself for some time , the laws of economics being slower to act than the laws of nature ? Many of these proposed laws , which aim to get around " the laws and principles which operate in our natural world , " pay lip service to the privateenterprise system , but would put it in such a strait-jacket that it could not operate , as you showed in your leading editorial of Aug. 23 . The fallacy that wages must not decline after a tremendous war boom appears in the proposed amendment to the minimum wage law providing that the minimum wage must be raised from 40 to 65 cents an hour , regardless of the great variation in the cost of living in various parts of this country . Such a law might bring about greater unemployment than if a minimum wage law had never been enacted and would introduce dangerous rigidities in our economy which might lead to social disorders . The President 's proposal that the Government should guarantee $25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of living between the North and the South and might result in the whole labor force in the South going on vacation for six months in the summer . HOWARD W. STARR . Huletts Landing , N. Y. , Aug. 25 , 1945 . Bible Still a Best Seller Records Seem to Indicate That Miss Stein Was Misinformed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In THE TIMES of Aug. 25 there appeared a column with the heading " GI Novel Written by Gertrude Stein , " which was cabled by C. L. Sulzberger from Paris . Miss Stein is quoted as making the following statement : " You do n't see any Bibles around like you did after the last war . " There is a whole paragraph to the effect that the soldiers have no interest in Bibles , and the general impression this will leave is that our soldiers are both irreligious and have no access to copies of the Scriptures . We would like to enter a strong protest against the dissemination of this point of view , because it is erroneous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soldier Miss Stein consorted with and interviewed . It is undoubtedly true that in an army as large as ours there are many soldiers who have little interest in religion , but to interview one soldier in an airplane and then base conclusions ' that he speaks for the whole Army in the matter of the soldier 's relation to the Bible is completely unwarranted . The American Bible Society has already distributed , at the explicit request of the chaplains and the men in service themselves , 8,000,000 copies of the Scriptures  --  Bibles , Testaments and portions . This society has instructed the chaplains not to send requests for Bibles unless these Bibles are called for by the men themselves . We know that these soldiers are reading these Bibles . J. CHAPMAN BRADLEY , Middlebury , Vt. , Aug. 30 , 1945 . The " Big E 's " Predecessor To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The editorial " Halsey and the Big E " is of great interest to all residents of the Champlain area , for the Enterprise was named after one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arnold and which , though defeated in October , 1776 , held back the British army under Burgoyne for a whole year . They could not advance until this fleet was destroyed . This year gave the revolting Colonies a chance to raise and equip an army to meet the British and defeat them at Saratoga . The first Enterprise rests in the lake off Ticonderoga , only a hulk , as she was burned to the water 's edge . All aircraft carriers in the beginning were named after famous ships of the Navy . Later this was changed to include the names of famous battles , and last spring the Coral Sea was changed at the last minute to the Franklin D. Roosevelt . S. H. P. PELL . Fort Ticonderoga , N. Y. , Aug. 27 , 1945 . Anent Pearl Harbor Report To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Until the Government is ready to give Lieutenant General Short and Admiral Kimmel the trial which they demand , what is the use of listening to anything which the Government has to say about responsibility for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to men who have been accused and who demand a trial is to confess corruption . MURRAY T. QUIGG . New York , Aug. 30 , 1945 . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : People are trying to find the scapegoat for Pearl Harbor without realizing that they themselves are guilty . Those who voted for the Congressmen who did everything to handicap President Roosevelt 's defense plans back in 1939 ? they ought to say , " Mea maxima culpa . " LOTTIE FAIRBROOK . New York , Aug. 28 , 1945 . Murray Bill Held Needless To THE EDITOR OF THIS Nuw YORK TIMES : Your editorial answering Senator Murray 's letter in defense of his socalled " Full Employment Bill " disposes quite effectively of his contentions . May I add one very significant admission in the Senator 's letter which it seems to me goes far to prove the needlessness of his bill ? He refers to " free competitive private enterprise which has given us the highest standard of living the world has ever known . " What more would he have ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well be due to other causes , as you point out , and it requires phenomenal faith to believe that the proposed legislation will abolish unemployment . GEORGE HAHN . New York , Aug. 29 , 1945 . Secretary , American Bible Society , New York , Aug. 30 , 1945 . Labor Not the Sole Factor Congress Is Urged to Give Attention Also to Needs of Industry To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Tung : At the hearings now being conducted before the Senate Banking and Currency Committee , as reported in THE NEW YORK TIMES , much is being said as to what the Government ought to do for labor and as to what the Government ought to give to labor during the forthcoming period of reconversion unemployment . Little is being said as to how to speed the reconversion period and enable industry to reabsorb those who have been or will be released from war work and those who presently will be taking off their military uniforms . That unemployment of sizable dimensions would be inevitable during the change-over period was obvious to any seeing eye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle with extravagance , and pressure groups are making demands on Government accordingly . During the Nineteen Thirties our Government was more social-minded and did more for labor than ever before in our history . However , despite the billions of debt that it piled up , in peacetime , mind you , there were still some seven to nine millions unemployed in 1939 when war came to Europe . Capital Handicapped During those same years there was generally an atmosphere of estrangement between Government and business . Name calling was indulged in . Did it ever occur to our lawmakers that business makes jobs under our capitalistic system of free enterprise , and that business , requiring the investment of risk capital , which , by the way , ofttimes is lost , will only operate and take risks when the atmosphere is friendly and opportunities for profit , all things considered , seem present ? As long as we adhere to the capitalist system in preference to any form of totalitarianism  --  and it 's a system that has made us the richest and mightiest nation in the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on all eight cylinders , instead of putting hindrances and obstacles in its path ? All new proposed legislation ought to be examined with this thought in mind . Of what use will it be to hand out another two billions in unemployment insurance if in the process risk capital be again forced into hiding ? Ready to Go Ahead Industry in this country today is raring to go after a brief period of change-over to peacetime production . It has the working capital . It has the plant . It has manifold new products and improved old products to put on the market . The pent-up demand for a. variety of goods that has gone unsatisfied these many years is huge both here and abroad . Let 's give business the right-of-way , subject , of course , to the standing rules and regulations . Let 's remove any barricades that exist , certainly not erect new ones . Let us encourage enterprising men to enter business in search of profits . They will create jobs and produce goods and services in the process . Labor has a stake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive , as well as capital . Labor need only compare its lot here , under the capitalist system , with that prevailing under any other system anywhere else in the world . A. Y. COWEN . New York , Aug. 30 , 1945 . Fewer Bureaus Advocated To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The American people should now take a genuine interest in the Government of this country . After the last war we staged a jazz age and took but little interest in national affairs . With the Roosevelt Administration verging on communism and with the multitude of bureaus established during that period , we now must revert to our democratic way of life . President Truman appears to want this form of government as he senses that the people themselves desire it . There are , however , many agencies still functioning which should now be abolished . Our history books have shown that the common man in this country may become President . If the common man studies and develops himself so that he becomes a leader whom the people come to love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find himself holding important political jobs . Let us all assume our rights as citizens and fight for the continuance of a democratic form of government . By abolishing the many bureaus now in Washington we can speedily return to a way of life which gives hope to every living American . CHESTER M. WAY .
