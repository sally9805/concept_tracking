In Berlin last week the U.S. forced an issue , and the long-awaited showdown over Germany tensely took shape . <P> For months the Allied Control Council had bumbled along in wordy futility , while the cleavage widened between the U.S. , Britain and France on one side and the Soviet Union on the other . Intended as a policy and lawmaking body for the four-power occupation of Germany , the council had degenerated into little more than a launching site for propaganda rockets . Making more propaganda , Russia 's Marshal Vasily Danilovich Sokolovsky took a pre-arranged walkout ( TIME , March 29 ) . <P> Last week his aim was mirrored by the Soviet-controlled German press in screaming headlines : " Western Powers Destroy Control Council . " By blaming the West for the council 's paralysis , the Soviets hoped to gain support among Germans who see it as the symbol of eventual German unity . <P> For once the Western powers reacted with speed and vigor . U.S. General Lucius Clay stated that there would be no further four-power meetings on any level until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengthened Clay 's hand with two moves : 1 ) it announced that plans to transfer U.S. control in Germany from the Army to the State Department had been canceled , thus leaving Clay in command ; 2 ) Secretary of State George Marshall served notice that " the U.S. intends to continue to fulfill its responsibilities as a member of the Control Council and as a joint occupant of the city of Berlin . " The second statement was a flat warning to Moscow that the only way Americans could be got out of Berlin in the foreseeable future would be for the Russians to throw them out-bodily.
