txt First indications that builders are joining the New England-wide strike of house buyers against high building costs were seen today in statistical studies released by two of the most reliable sources of housing information in Metropolitan Boston . The gathering momentum of what was supposed to have been a postwar housing boom was thrown into reverse in. the month of March , when only 62.100 new houses were started , compared with nearly 87,000 in March , 1946 , according to John M. Dobbs , Regional Housing Expediter . Supporting this statement for Massachusetts alone , the Department of Labor and Industries disclosed ? that $4,030,902 worth of new housing were applied for in March this year , as opposed to nearly $5,400,000 in the similar month last . year . Buyers Balk At the same time , visible evidences of why the builders are slowing down is seen in hundreds of new houses finished and waiting for buyer. ; who do not come , along the entire New England housing front . " The buyers wo n't buy , and now the builders are refusing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Master Builders Association of Boston . The contrasts between what the builders were doing before ' ' Larch and what they are doing now were found in the houses started and finished for the comparative months . Completions this March totaled 57,100 new permanent units , plus about 28,400 other types compared with 22,600 permanents , and 8,600 other types in March , 1946 . This means that , although ' .5 , - 500 permanent units were finished last March , only 31,200 were completed in March , 1946 . Thus the units ready for occupancy this year were far ahead of those ready last year , whereas the units started for future occupancy were considerably less this March than for last March . Feel Buyers ' Pressure These - figures point to the growing reluctance of builders to enter a field of speculation that faces the rising pressure of a buyer 's strike , according ? to ? Norman Morse , Secretary of the Master Builders Association . Other - facts released by the Housing Expediter appeared to substantiate that conclusion . For the lagging efforts in home building came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no resultant decreases in prices or wages . Production of most building materials in March increased over February , Mr. Dobbs said . Pig iron and most plumbing fixtures are more plentiful , he stated . Cast iron soil pipe was up 21.5 per cent in production for the first quarter of 1947 , over the last three months of 1946 , he pointed out . Sinks and bathtubs , cast-iron pressure pipe and lavatories were reported by Mr. Dobbs to be in growing supply . Yet the uncertainty of price , the impossibility of working on fixed margins , plus the lagging home sales are grarivally discouraging builders from making new building starts , according to Mr. Morse . All builders . he said , are working on a " cost plus " basis . They anticipate a $9,000 price , only to find it grows to $11,000 and $12,000 , he added . He could , see no relief from high prices until labor and manufacturing costs come down , Slump Forecast Meanwhile , an impasse exists on housing now completed . Buyers either wilt not buy at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have expended considerable sums in building either will not or can not come down in price . With fewer and fewer builders or buyers able to hurdle the price barrier , home building faces a slump , in the opinion of housing authorities . The slump is already evident in growing unemployment reported by the Building Trades Council of Greater Boston in the building field . In the aggregate , the Housing Expediter 's report for the first quarter of 1947 showed the second highest volume of privately financed housing started since the 1920 's . Hence , the Mardi setback did not concern Mr. Dobbs as much as it . did others in the industry . " Completions are still at a reasonably high rate , even though they fell off somewhat in March from last year , " he said . " Materials are maintaining a heavy flow , and construction time for houses is being shortened . " Price Rules Action He cited the statement of his superiors in Washington that " construction would increase as fast as costs are reduced . " But the building trades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went Mr. Dobbs one better . They insisted that " construction would decrease rapidly unless costs are not reduced . " They base this contention on the point that many builders of finished houses may be forced to sell at a loss . Thus caught short in the market , " builders wilt not be so eager to start new houses until prices are ironed out . " The March statistics . they say , bear out their convictions .
