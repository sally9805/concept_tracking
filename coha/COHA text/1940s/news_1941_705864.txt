txt Government will not " tolerate " price inflation , Treasury Secretary Morgenthau warned last night . " The most effective way to prevent a ciamaking rise in prices is , quite simply , to release surpluses from storage , " the secretary told the Advertising Club of Boston . Mr. Morgenthau said such consumers goods as the following should be released to block artificially rising prices : Wheat flour , cotton , butter , cheese , beef and pork . He also advocated a bigger import quota for Canadian wheat . The Secretary warned against exploitation of the defense program by any group , laborers , farmers , businessmen , bankers . Besides releasing surpluses to hold down prices , Mr. Morgenthau listed six other measures to combat price inflation . 1 . An American plan of forced saving called a " separation wage " which would assure a regular wage for a stated period in case a worker loses his job . 2 . Extension of general controls bank credit and creation of controls selected capital expenditures. 3 . Heavier taxes next year . 4 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase . 5 . Extension of the social security program " so as to increase the flow of funds to the Treasury from current income during the emergency and increase the outflow of funds when needed in the post-defense period . " 6 . Further reduction of non-defense federal expenditures . Mr. Morgenthau argued it is " sheer folly " for the farmer to push up prices by " creating scarcities . " The farmers " suffered cruelly for twelve long years after the collapse of the inflation of 1920 and 1921 , " he said . Assails Recurring Wage Increases It is also " sheer folly , " Mr. Morgenthau said , for .. nabor leaders to seek new wage increases every few.mondts-7neW - increase &Which; in turn produce higher manufacturing costs , higher prices. ? and a- higher cost of Ming : " The Treasury head considers it " short . sighted " and " poor business " for landlords to raise rents ; for any businessman to seek exorbitant profits in this period of defense spending , and for any banker to . exploit the present demand for funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation is more destructive of morale than any other single factor . " Inflation divides the country . It sets up producers against consumers , workers against employers , the people who owe money against the people to whom the money is owed . " For this reason , he said , " I give you only this pledge  --  that this administration will do everything humanly possible to prevent inflation . " In proposing the release of surplus commodities from both Government and private warehouses , the cabinet member declared : " If we were to let them flow to the public , we would not only help in keeping prices stable but we would be doing something even more important ; we would be helping to make people healthier and happier . " Reserve Stocks Above Year Ago Reserve stocks of butter , cheese , beef and pork now held in this country are far higher than they were a year ago , and higher ' than the average of the past five years , he said , adding : " I wonder if the housewife knows , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a bag of flour , that our supply ' of wheat is the largest on record , and that 498 million bushels of several years ' crops are available in Canada . " The Treasury head conceded that only three months ago a rigid quota was applied to the importation of wneat from Canada , with the objective to keeping up the price of wheat in the United States . " But it is also true , " he said , " that only the other day the quota on sugar from Cuba was enlarged so substantially as to absorb most of the reserve stocks in that country. - It seems to be desirable and necessary that we now follow the example set in the case of Cuban sugar and permit the entry of Canadian wheat in larger volume . " Criticizes Congress on Cotton Mr. Morgenthau severely criticized Congress for attempting to freeze seven million bales of Government-owned cotton while the price to the consumer was rising from 9.5 cents a pound on August 1 , 939 to over 17 cents per pound at present . " We ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the market in times like these " , he declared . Today 's economy , Mr. Morgenthau said resembles an ? overloaded steam boiler . " If we fail to use the controls at our disposal now , if we fail to do the specific things which are in our power to check inflation now , if we allow prices to go on rising as they did from 1916 to 1920 , we may find that food , fuel , shelter and clothing which now cost a dollar will once more cost almost twice as much before the process has ended . " Mr. Morgenthau illustrated the rising of prices with a chart which showed the declining purchasing power of a single dollar during the years 1939 to 1941 . The chart contrasted the decrease during the last two years , with the decrease ? which occurred during the first two years of the World War . The chart showed a drop of 6% in the dollar 's buying power since 1939 . The drop during the same period of the World War was 8% . Other comparative decreases in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10% ; 1939-1941 , 12% ; clothing 1914-1916 , 11% ; 1939-941 , 3% ; shelter 1914-1916 , 2% ; 1939-1941 , 1% ; . heat and light 1914-1916 , 4% ; 1939-1941 , 4%.
