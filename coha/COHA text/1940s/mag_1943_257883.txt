From Tunisia , fortnight ago , came five striking newspictures . U.S. publishers played them big . One was particularly eye-catching : a photo of a U.S. patrol advancing across a Tunisian plain while in the foreground Medical Corpsmen fixed up a wounded trooper . TIME and the news papers , rushing to press , played the picture straight . The New York Daily News gave it a ten-column , double-truck display , called it " a great battle picture " ; so did Editor &; Publisher , publication trade weekly . LIFE , pondering the picture , had grave qualms , finally printed it double-spread , but with a skeptical caption : " . . . In spite of the apparent approach of enemy planes . . . soldiers are still rid ing forward , not bothering to take cover . . . . Furthermore , none of the soldiers is looking at the bomb bursts which them selves are not behaving exactly the way bomb bursts usually behave . ... " <P> Last week U.S. publishers learned that they had been hoaxed . The photos did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official captions had said . <P> They showed troops training in Africa under simulated battle conditions . The photos were taken by Associated Press Photographer Harrison B. Roberts , who wrote " misleading " captions for them . What might have given U.S. citizens pause was the undeniable fact that both photos and captions had been passed by Army field censors , approved for publication by the War Department 's Bureau of Public Relations in Washington , and released under the war picture-pooling arrangement . <P> At week 's end a red-faced A.P . asked a red-faced War Department to cancel Roberts ' correspondent status . The War Department obliged . Roberts will be brought home . Nobody would bring the field censors home . Nobody could bring the War Department home .
