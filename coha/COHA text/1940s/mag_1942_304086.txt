Twelve hours out of New York , 60 miles off Long Island 's fingerlike north tip at Montauk Point , the Panamanian tanker Norness pressed toward Halifax . She carried 10,000 tons of fuel oil and a 40-man Scandinavian crew . <P> Suddenly a torpedo ripped into the tanker 's hull on the port side . Ten minutes later another direct hit was scored from starboard . In something like 14 minutes Captain Harold Hansen and his men ( save two , who slipped from sight ) were struggling with lifeboats and life rafts in the chilling , oil-drenched water . A third , final torpedo struck again from port side . The 9,577-ton tanker canted drunkenly but did not entirely sink . The sub , surfaced after the third shot , made no attempt to pick up survivors . A second officer insisted that his raft was fired on " five or six times " by the sub 's deck gun . A fishing boat , U.S. destroyer and Coast Guard cutter picked up the 38 chilled survivors . Said blond , soft-voiced Skipper Hansen : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York harbor . " <P> Less than 36 hours later torpedoes caught the 6,768-ton British tanker Coimbra some 60 miles from the Norness attack scene , a scant 20 miles from Southampton , L.I. , only 100 miles east of New York City , and left it sinking . <P> Off the North Carolina coast the heavily laden U.S. tanker Allan Jackson swerved desperately to avoid a torpedo that broke water 150 yards short of its mark , then scored a direct hit amidships . Only 13 of the crew of 35 reportedly survived . Also off North Carolina the tanker Malay was torpedoed but limped to safety . <P> What is a submarine menace ? It is certainly not the scatter-aim , hope-to-hit show that Jap subs have put on off the Pacific Northwest . It is , in 1942 , a grim thing . <P> Last Time . To many an American who recalls the formidable adventures of German U-boat skippers like Von Nostitz , Janckendorf and Koenig , reports of abandoned survivors and gun-strafed life rafts were far cries from the heroic U-boat actions of the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped boldly into shore waters , in less than six months of 1918 they sowed mines , sank six steamships and 31 other vessels . Then their commanding officers were fighting gentlemen who usually took excellent care of their prisoners and actually had fun matching wits with frantic U.S. harbor-defense units . <P> There was the U-151 . In May 1918 , she stood off New York harbor , there to lay mines and cut cables . U-151 's Lieut . Korner later wrote : " When night came we could see the lights of Broadway . Some of the boys suggested that we sneak up the Hudson River and go to a show . What a joke that would be ! For three days we crossed what we hoped were the cable areas , and for three nights we were tormented by the lights of Broadway . . . . " <P> There was the U-156 . On a Sabbath morning in July 1918 , she popped up opposite Provincetown , Mass. , stayed 90 minutes , fired 147 rounds , sank a tug and three barges .
