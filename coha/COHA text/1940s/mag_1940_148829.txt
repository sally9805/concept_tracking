ARMY &; NAVY <P> The British captured the first U. S. S. Washington in 1776 ( on Lake Champlain ) . With shells , torpedos and bombs , the U. S. Navy sank its fifth Washington in 1924 . This sacrifice was then supposed to be the highest form of sanity ; the U. S. people were glad to contribute an unfinished , 32,000-ton battleship to Disarmament . The U. S. having adopted new standards of sanity , the Navy last week launched its sixth Washington. * <P> A long hail from the ten-gun sailing galley of 1776 was Washington VI . The grey-black monster which smoked down the ways of the Philadelphia Navy Yard into the muddy Delaware River last week was : <P> &gt; The first battleship launched by the U. S. Navy since 1921 . <P> &gt; The Navy 's first full 35,000-ton battleship ( the 15 in service range from 26,100 to 33,400 tons ) . <P> &gt; The 108th combat ship launched by the Navy since its renaissance began in 1933-The <P> Washington will not long be lonely . Five other 35,000-ton battleships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also abuilding for the Navy . Next to be launched is the 35,000-ton North Carolina next week ( at the Brooklyn Navy Yard ) . But launching is not completion : not before December 1941 will the Washington be fitted with her nine 16-inch guns , her secondary batteries of twelve five-inchers , her complement of eight antiaircraft guns . By official confession , ships so far along in construction can not be altered to benefit in full from the antiaircraft lessons taught by World War II . Washington VI nonetheless is far ahead of Washington V : longer ( 125 ft. ) ; 16-inch armor ( instead of tapering from 16 to 14 inches ) ; two layers of deck armor , instead of a single , three-inch layer ( the upper one six inches thick , the lower four inches ) ; faster ( rated at 28 knots , expected to better that ; the last Washington was rated at 21 knots ) . Probable cost : a whopping $80,000,000 . <P> What with traditional naval secrecy and last week 's accent on fifth columns , the Navy made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . Four miles of the Delaware River were temporarily closed to shipping , lest passing sailors get a peek at the secret superstructure . Philadelphia police and FBI agents kept tabs on the 35,000 ( mostly Navy yard workers , their families , naval personnel ) who were admitted to the Yard for the big baptism . <P> The June day was hot , the crowd was in a sweat when pretty , 15-year-old Virginia Marshall , of Spokane , Wash. , smashed a christening bottle of champagne across the bow . Sponsor Marshall 's great-greatgrandfather was Chief Justice Marshall , for whose funeral Philadelphia 's Liberty Bell tolled till it cracked in 1835 . Just as the new Washington eased into the water last week , the sky darkened , but not with planes . It was just a cloud momentarily dimming the sun . <P> <P> - This one is named for the State of Washington . Two predecessors were also named for the State , three for George .                    @
