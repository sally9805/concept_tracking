In Moscow the winter snow had vanished . Street vendors were selling daffodils at 3 rubles each . Gourmets could buy tiny hothouse cucumbers , small succulent leaves of early lettuce , tiny radishes and tomatoes . Women discarded fur hats and thick wool shawls for bright head scarves . The sun came out . The Russian Pashka ( Easter , a week later on the Julian calendar ) had arrived in Moscow . <P> On Easter Eve , Russians of all ages , types and uniforms milled about with the candles they would light at midnight . The greatest excitement centered around Epiphany Cathedral , where the Patriarch Alexei-assisted by his metropolitans and bishops-would officiate . Twelve thousand Muscovites churned and shouted gaily in the clear starry night outside . Inside the cathedral were 7,000 more , unlit candles in hand . <P> At midnight , in his organ voice , the Patriarch chanted , " Christ is risen , Christ is risen , " while the choir and the 7,000 took up the refrain . Light from the Patriarch 's candle , touched quickly to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his robes of silvered silk and wearing a pearl-and-diamond crown , the Patriarch swung his fragrant censer , blessed them all . <P> The Patriarch mounted the rostrum in the middle of the nave . Acolytes ceremonially stripped him of his outer robes and crown . Then over the Patriarch 's shoulders they draped three layers of bright , resurrection-season vestments-scarlet and gold in place of silver , a crown of gold and rubies for the pearl-and-diamond one . As each vestment was presented to him on a velvet-covered silver salver , the Patriarch reverently kissed it . For the last time the acolytes came forward with the salver . Typically Russian pomp turned to typically Russian casualness . The Patriarch did not kiss the object he took from the salver ; it was not sacred . He simply picked up the large yellow , celluloid comb ( lacking three teeth ) and combed the patriarchal hair and beard in full view of the congregation . <P> Outside , at 2 a.m . Easter morning , thousands still stood before the cathedral , listening to the music and occasionally crossing themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian Easter greeting , " Christ is risen , " and the answer , " He is truly risen , " and exchanged the ceremonial three kisses . <P> This happened last Sunday , in the 30th year after the Revolution .
