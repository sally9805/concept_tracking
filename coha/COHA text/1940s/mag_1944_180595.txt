Then came the second attack , to the west , in the Portland and Weymouth area of Dorset . German armor poured quickly through the inviting flats up to the rolling Salisbury Plain and the Cotswolds , then swerved southeastward to take London from the rear . In the final stages the last British remnants in North Wales were cleaned up completing the occupation of England . <P> History , was not written that way because Germany lost the battle of the air and because of the basic British character , which Germans have never understood .
