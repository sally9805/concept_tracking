WEAPONS of mass destruction create , among other problems , a problem for the editors of alma  --  nacs , who feel obliged to report the pop  --  ulation of cities . In the 1947 World illmanerc , the editors desperately faced up to the matter by the use of a foot  --  note . Nagasaki is listed as having a population of *253,000 , and the foot  --  note reads , " Before atom bombing . " Apparently , Hiroshima was to have been solved the same way , but the asterisk slipped ( or was pushed ) . We found it in front of Minsk , U.S.S.R. , population *239,000an errant aster  --  isk , the work , probably , of a mad type  --  setter , fumbling with his own private Domesday . E are in receipt of a letter from Mr. Roy J. Wilkes , president of a firm called Remember , with offices on East Forty-ninth Street , inviting us to sign up for a service that will remind us of important dates in our life ? " the birthday of someone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointment . " " How many times during each year are you socially embarrassed simply because you have failed to remember an important date ? " Mr. Wilkes writes . " The con  --  sequences can he severely humiliating and unsavory . On the enclosed calendar you circle the dates that are important for you to remember during the course of a year that commences one month from the date on which you mail in the enclosed registration . Thereafter , one week prior to each date that you have circled , we shall inform you by letter that this particular date is just around the corner . We tie the string around our finger for You . " The cost of this aide  --  wemoire depends on how much string you sign up for . Well , the sun never sets but what we find ourself in some mortifying fix caused by forgetfulness , so the answer to Wilkes ' question is three hundred and sixty-five . The trouble with his offer , as far as we are concerned , is ( a ) our immediate relatives always remind us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when there is still plenty of time to get to the stores ; ( b ) we rarely make appointments ( the source of all our humiliation ) from one to thirteen months ahead ; and ( c ) even if we did , a week 's notice would do us no good , for who would remind us at the end of that week ? What we need is someone who will tie the string around his finger for us fifteen minutes ahead of the deadline . Wilkes is n't geared for this , and that lets us out . But we shall think with pleasure of the less demand  --  ing people whom Remember is cur  --  rently saving from shame . " Meet you at the Yale Club bar , twelve-forty-five , Washington 's Birthday , 1949 , " one says to a friend , secure in the knowledge that on February 15th of that year he will get a timely nudge . And if his lunch companion has died in the interim , or moved to Jamaica , or signed up with a firm called Forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yale men are a notably gregarious hunch and do not let each other eat alone . Air the urging of an upper-East Side tipster , who said that the water in his neighborhood had been tasting funny lately ( " kind of like a swimming pool , " he wrote ) , we splashed down to the Municipal Building last week and had an informative chat with Mr. Tobias Hochlerner , Chief Engineer of the Bu  --  reau of Water Supply of the Depart  --  ment of Water Supply , Gas , and Elec  --  tricity . Mr. Hochlerner was delighted to hear that we were concerned about water . " The average New Yorker just is n't interested in his water supply , " he told us moodily . He admitted right off that the last few weeks have been trying ones in municipal water circles . Several dozen dwellers in the East Sev  --  enties and Eighties have registered complaints , ranging from mild to hys  --  terical , about their water , saying that it seems intolerably over-chlorinated and demanding immediate corrective action . Mr. Hochlerner 's explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion gallons of water a day , he told us , and always chlorinates it , as does every other self-respecting municipality . At the city 's two main sources of supply ? the Catskills and Croton  --  chlorine is mixed with water in the proportion of from two to three pounds to a million gallons . Additional chlorine is applied as the water flows toward local faucets Most of the chemical gets thoroughly absorbed , and by the time the water reaches its destination there is only a faint residue of free chlorine , usually one part to thirty million parts of water . Not even Lucius Beebe can taste it . Now , then , that section of Manhattan just east of Central Park uses Croton water , which reaches the Park reservoir by means of an aqueduct and a system of pipe lines , and is thence pumped east  --  ward at Eighty-sixth Street Early in January , the Bureau of Water Supply , which is continually sampling its water upstate , noticed , at Croton , the sudden appearance of a microscopic vegetable organism called synura , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil that has a disagreeable taste and odor , which chlorine intensifies . The Bureau 26 MARCH 8 , 1947 promptly increased its chlorine ration by almost one-half and , for good measure , dosed its Croton water with copper sul  --  phate ( around a pound and a half per million gallons ) , hoping thus to kill off the organisms long before they got close to the city . Some of the dead organisms , however , slipped through into the Cen  --  tral Park Reservoir . When the water containing the vegetable matter was again chlorinated , at Eighty-sixth Street , people living close to this point of treat  --  ment got a strong , earthy , cucumber-like taste . " There was nothing we could do about that , " said Mr. Hochlerner . " These visitations of undesirable organ  --  isms come and go . This time it was svnura . Next time , for all we know , it may he aphamezonenon . But there was never any cause for alarm . Why , you could drink a billion synuras and they would n't affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sy-nura occurred in the winter of 1945 ( cold weather seems to bring out the worst in water  --  borne microscopic vegetable organisms ) , but it lasted only two weeks . The cur rent siege reached its peak of unpleasant  --  ness early in February , and the last , slight traces of it will probably be trick  --  ling through some fashionable East Side spigots this week . Most of the run-of-the-mill com  --  plaints the city gets about water , Mr. Hochlerner told us , are attributable not to any basic aqueous defect but to rusty plumbing . In thirty-seven years with the water-supply system , he has never heard of an authentic case of a frog 's pop  --  ping up in anybody 's bathtub , but every now and then the city does have a visita  --  tion of the Cyclops , a fresh-water crusta  --  cean the size of a pinhead , which sneaks through the Bureau 's defenses . There have been scattered instances , too , of eels turning up in apartments . They enter the water system when they are infants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so large they get stuck in them . The Bureau 's most nerve-racking experience occurred five years ago , in connection with some Catskill water flowing into the Hillview Reser  --  voir , near the Empire City race track . At Hillview , the water passes through fine-mesh screens , to block the way of full-grown eels and other undesirables . All at once , in 1942 , billions of saw-bellies , a species of fish less than an inch long , came cruising down the aqueduct from the Catskills . For a week , day and night , the Bureau had men cleaning sawbellies off the Hillview screens , but a few fish got into the city anyhow . " I guess you never really know what you 'll find in the water next , " Mr. Hochlerner told us . " But remember , New York water is perfectly excellent and sanitary water .

Total cost : twenty-six cents . Gulley 's Experiment RALPH GULLEY , an industrial de- signer and partner of Donald Deskey , has completed an experiment that deserves recording . He wore the same tie every day for a year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it when we interviewed him the other day  --  an Indian hand-woven number , with alternate slanting stripes of brown and rust , unobtrusive but not mousy . The experiment came about more or less accidentally . " I bought the tie in the fall of 1945 and put it on the next day , " the great pioneer told us . " We were terribly busy at the office , and every morning I 'd throw my clothes on and run . This tie always happened to he handy , and after two or three weeks it occurred to me I 'd been wearing it every day and nobody had noticed it , not even my wife , whom I regard as a normally vigilant woman . I decided to keep on wearing it until somebody did . " Well , no one did , and after six monot  --  onous months , Gulley gave his wife a hint . This took the form of a loud snicker at breakfast each morning . After two weeks of his snicker  --  ing , Mrs. Gulley inquired what the joke was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ly ? " Gulley asked . " You snicker a lot , " she said . " I mean have n't you noticed anything about m3 tie ? " he pursued . After a pause , she said she thought he 'd been wearing it an awful lot , and he let her in on the experiment . She was mortified . Gulley saw his secretary , a girl called Peggy , and Deskey , an ac ? knowledged authority on color , line , and design , nearly every day . " There were times , " he said , " when I 'd think they probably had noticed it but were just being tactful  --  you know , thought I had some neurotic compulsion and wanted to be polite about it . There are fifty or sixty people in the of  --  fice , and none of them caught on . I wore the damn thing everywhere , night and day , and none of my friends noticed it . " This went on , as we said , for a year . Gulley was thinking of continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused him to wind it - up . " A hunch of us were talk  --  ing about clothes , " he said , " how impor  --  tant colors and tailoring and so on are , and I asked the others if they really no  --  tice what people wear . They all said yes , of course . I sprang the tie on them , and they could n't believe it . Peggy swore she 'd seen me in other ties during the year , and even tried to describe them , but she gave up after a couple of days . " Since violating security , Gulley has occasionally broken out other ties , but he has got to like his Indian one so much that he still wears it most of the time , without any scientific excuse . Though it has never been cleaned or pressed , it is in fine shape . " It 's got to he sort of part of me , " he told us . " If it wears out , I 'll try to have it duplicated , though I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid a couple of dollars for it , and the salesman said it came from Arizona or New Mexico . " Gulley says his experiment saved him the strain must men undergo each morning select  --  ing a tie , and from twenty-five to thirty dollars . Explanation AN ardent skier of our acquaintance has forwarded the following ex plicit letter , which the manager of a ski hostel up in Vermont sent him in re sponse to a request for reservations for three couples : DEAR SiR : We are sorry to report that at present we are sold out until March 10th. and even then there are only rooms for four left . The majority of our rooms are for four people , and usually when the space is so limited groups like yours will split up and the three woolen will sleep in one four room with two double beds and the men in the other four room . Another idea would be for two couples to take a four room and the third couple a room for two , but just now we have no room for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancellations on the rooms for two , so if we have any four rooms you would either have to take the two four rooms with two couples in one and one couple in the other or the two four rooms with three apiece . Please let us know if the above is of any help to you . Wise Fraud WHEN the movie " Duel in the Sun " has its premiere here , more or less simultaneous premieres will take place in a number of South American countries , and in the copies of the film shown down there the characters will be speaking fluent Spanish . We 've been to see the people responsible for pass  --  ing this miracle , the Eastern Sound Studios , 550 Fifth Avenue , and have had a seminar with Dr. Lester G. Crocker , a dark-haired , articulate young man who used to he a professor of Ro  --  mance languages at Queens College and is now director of production at Eastern , and hence knows practically all there is to know about lip synchronization , vul  --  garly called dubbing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started operations , back in 1944 , speaks excel  --  lent French and Spanish , can get along in Portuguese and Italian , and has a smattering of German . With us , he spoke English . Most of the pictures Eastern works on , he told us , are headed for Latin American erican countries , since Spain , France , and other important European outlets have laws providing that foreign-made pictures must he dubbed over there . Eastern 's treat ment of a picture takes from eight to twelve weeks . The procedure begins with a runoff attended by a sound engineer , a translator , young Dr. Crocker , and the man who is to direct the Spanish-speaking ac tors , of which there seem to he plenty around New York . The pic ture is then broken down into " loops , " or short sections of film that include five or six sentences MARCH 8 , 1947 of refreshing dialogue . ( " I love you . " " I love you , too . " " Yeah ? " ) The average American movie produces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English script , the transla  --  tor makes a rough Spanish translation with the aid of a Moviola , a machine that enables him to view the loops through a large magnifying glass while listening to the sound track through ear  --  phones . Then he joins the director in what is known as " adjusting , " which takes about three weeks . The two men go over each loop together , changing the Spanish dialogue until it matches all the lip movements of the original actors . " That 's the crux of the whole thing , " Dr. Crocker said , " and it hinges on two factors  --  the length of the sentences and the matching of the labials . We have to find words and phrases that preserve the meaning of the story , are good Spanish , and at the same time match the lip movements . It would look funny to a Spanish audience if a character who said TIl break it ' in English said something in Spanish that did n't require him to close his mouth . " Eastern has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from these are chosen actors with voices appropriate to , but not necessarily the equivalents of , the originals . The recording is then undertaken . The actors learn their parts by heart , loop by loop . ( Dr. Crocker feels strongly that few people can act and read at the same time . ) When the Spanish-speaking actors ' voices have been recorded , cutters take over , match  --  ing the new sound track to the move  --  ments of the lips . This sound track is then mixed with other sound tracks , con  --  taining music and sound effects , which , when they occur along with dialogue , have to be duplicated rather than trans  --  ferred from the English sound track . We saw a list of effects that are being duplicated in a single reel of a film now being worked on , and among them were the sounds of a volcano rumbling and in eruption , fire crackling , a waterfall fall  --  ing , a wild parrot screaming , a sword hitting a mask , and church bells . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound track , Eastern bows nut . The making of the working film is done in laboratories else  --  where . Eastern dubs for most of the big companies . " Duel in the Sun , " which Eastern hopes to finish by March 15th , is the second-longest picture it has ever tackled ; " Since You Went Away " was the longest . Some people down in Latin America apparently regard dubbing as a fraud , but Dr , Crocker has an answer for that . " Suppose it is a fraud ? " he says . " It 's a wise fraud . A large percentage of Latin-American people are illiterate and would n't he able to understand sub  --  titles . Besides , a person who merely sees subtitles is bound to miss the finer shades of acting . Finally , everything in moving pictures is fraud , is illusion . Plenty of American pictures take place in France , but the people in them talk English , do n't they ? " Chivalry A MEMBER of our intelligence I. staff happened to be hanging around in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , middle-aged men came in and looked for a place at the fountain . A girl who was seated there with an empty stool on either side of her perceived that they wanted to sit to  --  gether , smiled at them , and shifted to the empty place on her left . One of the men thanked her , then turned to his companion . " You see , Harry ? " he said . " There are some ladies left in the world . " Milestone NOW that the United Nations Commission on Human Rights , on which Mrs. Roosevelt sits , has con  --  cluded its first session , she is off on a West Coast lecture tour . Topic : " Have We an Instrument for Peace ? " We THE NEW YORKER had a talk with her just before she Left . Topic : " United Nations Commission on Human Rights to Date . " " Most of its members believe its work is more im  --  portant than that of any other com  --  mission , " she said . " We feel that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition and enforcement of the rights of man . I know these are men  --  tioned in many constitutions and recog  --  nized by many nations , but this is the first time an attempt has been made to put them on an international basis . If that principle can be accepted , it will be a milestone in the time schedule of his  --  tory . " We asked Mrs. Roosevelt if his  --  tory really has a time schedule , and she nodded . " I remember hearing my hus  --  band tell of a talk he had with Chiang Kai-shek in Cairo , " she said . " They were discussing the Pacific area and the development of different peoples on dif  --  ferent islands there . Some , they thought , could have self-government almost im  --  mediately , others in ten or fifteen years . When they came to Borneo , where , as you know , there are savage head-hunt  --  ers , one of them said , ' I 'm afraid it will take about fifty years before they are ready to govern themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of whether you have a bamboo but or a bathtub as whether you want the free  --  dom to say what customs you 're to have in order to live cooperatively . We have to assume that people really want this freedom , or we will suffer destruction . " Mrs. Roosevelt thinks there is n't much hope for her commission 's objective , or for much else , unless we can get along with Russia . " Oh , " she said , " the misun  --  derstanding that can arise from such an apparently small matter as a difference in parliamentary procedure ! For example , we vote first on the amendment that is furthest away from the original motion , whereas in Russia they vote first on the amendment nearest the original motion . The Rus  --  sians feel they 're being dis  --  criminated against when they have to wait for their amendments to come up . " They also feel , we gathered , that our newspapers are not always fair to them . Ac  --  cording to Mrs. R. , a Rus  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , philosophically , that no man is really free was , on the strength of that obser  --  vation , accused in the local press of not believing in liberty . " I wish to point out that I am for liberty , " he stated at the next meeting . Mrs. Roosevelt presented us with two instances illustrative of the differences between the American and the Russian point of view : ( 1 ) A Soviet lady lec  --  turer , after a tour here , told her , " Our country does n't have your kind of free  --  dom . Here I get on a train and I feel tired and want to close my eyes . That is all I wish to feel free to do . But a sailor is also on the train , and he is whistling and whistling . In Russia , he would not whistle . " ( 2 ) A British United Nations man , while in Russia , took some lessons in Russian from a Soviet girl . One day , as they were about to conjugate a rather difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he would treat a European woman of a different country . " You never kiss my hand , " she said . Ducking the sequel , if any , to this anecdote , Mrs. Roosevelt went on to say that the adjective for Russian psy  --  chology is " uncertain " and for ours " complacent . " " We have a terrible tendency to think that whatever we de  --  cide is right , " she said . " We often gloss over the curious give-and-take involved in dealing with other peoples . It is n't just language trouble ; it 's that we make the mistake of not trying to understand the finer points of what other people are thinking . " Our adjective , and adverb . for Mrs. Roosevelt vis-a-vis the Soviet is " cautiously hopeful . " When she was in London , she felt the Russians there were automatons ; here , at commission meet  --  ings , she has found them easier to work with , less inflexible . " I 'm getting used to their tactics of delaying until they 've heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sometimes have to wait for in  --  structions myself , And I wonder how we would feel if we were beaten as often as they are in United Nations meetings . " All in all , Mrs. Roosevelt likes her work . " You get a sense , in miniature , of what must happen in the world , " she said . Transient A MAN who had occasion the other A I. evening to send a telegram to a friend who lives on Sutton Place dialled - Western Union and found himself con  --  nected with a girl who could n't seem to get the address straight . She read it back as " Sudden Place , " and then as " Southern Place , " and the man ex  --  claimed , " No , no ! Sutton  --  S-u-t-t-o-n . Have n't you ever heard of Sutton Place ? " " Nape , " the girl replied calm  --  ly . " Pm from Pittsburgh , and what 's more , I 'm going back there just as soon as I can . "
