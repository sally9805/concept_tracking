Many Congressmen had grave doubts about the wisdom of lowering taxes when nobody knew how many billions of dollars might be needed for the insecure international future . But there was no doubt that the people wanted an income-tax cut . And there was never any doubt , in an election year , that the Republican-dominated Congress meant to give it to them . <P> When the Senate-approved bill to cut income taxes by $4.8 billion reached the House last week , Minority Leader Sam Rayburn did his best as a Canute . He cried that it was reckless , in these times , to invite deficits : " Had n't we better stay in a position where we will have the money to defend our shores ? " But the House was in no mood for debate or delay . When the vote came , 84 Democrats deserted the Administration . The overwhelming tide of passage : 289 to 67 . <P> That was 51 votes over the two-thirds majority needed to override the President 's veto , expected this week . House and Senate majority leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ammunition from the Administration itself : last week the Government 's surplus surged to $7,163,095,565 , and all the 1947 income-tax returns were not yet totaled . When they were , the surplus might be enough to cover both the $4.8 billion tax reduction and the $3 billion budget boost which the armed forces were asking . <P> Something for Everybody . Individual taxpayers would find the new schedules as hard to understand as ever , but not at all difficult to take ; there was something for everybody . Lifting of personal exemptions from $500 to $600 ( and an extra $600 for those 65 or over ) would take all or much of the sting out of the income tax for low-income families . For 7,400,000 lower-bracket families ( up to $2,000 net income ) it meant no more income tax at all . For about 55 of every 100 taxpayers-those with more than $2,000 but less than $5,000 net income-it meant reductions of one-half to one-quarter in what the boss withholds for the Government . Those two groups combined-about 95 of every 100 taxpayers-would get the benefit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other five of every 100 taxpayers there were other benefits . The optional standard deduction was switched from a flat $500 to 10% of net income ( so long as it does not exceed $1,000 ) . Thus , the $8,000-a-year man could list $800 for deductions if he does not choose to itemize them . A bigger saving was in a new allowance after the tax has been computed . For the last two years , this has been a flat 5% . In the new schedules , this subtraction would be 17% on the first $400 of tax , 12% on the rest up to $100,000 , 9.75% above that . Its average effect : a 12.6% cut . <P> With the Wife 's Help . Along with the subtractions , something new was added which would make dinner-table conversation out of the new tax bill for many weeks . It extends to taxpayers in all states the income-splitting benefits enjoyed by those in the twelve states ( and Hawaii ) with community-property laws. + For middle-bracket and upper-bracket taxpayers , this system of putting man &; wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 ) was the real bonanza .
