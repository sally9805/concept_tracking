Our national standard of living must be reduced to the level which prevailed in 1932. - Leon Henderson . <P> As for the inconveniences , discomforts and hardships that you and I will have to endure-why , we have n't even got to the foothills yet . . . . We 'll do without a lot of things until it really hurts every single one of us. - Don Nelson . <P> Our civilian economy is fast going on a minimum subsistence standard. - Bill Batt . <P> In such words , and many more , too many people have been telling too many other people that the U.S. citizen is going to have to " suffer . " Everyone tells him that something nebulous and horrible is going to hit him any minute , exhorts him to be ready and brave . The average citizen , in fact , is beginning to feel that it is hardly decent for him not to " suffer . " But what does this nebulous " suffering " amount to ? <P> Leon Henderson has defined it in dollars . The U.S. this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income to spend for $9,000,000,000 less goods and services than it bought last year . Next year the spread will be even bigger . That is indeed inflationary , but is it suffering ? Something like two-thirds of the $9 billion cut just means that there will be practically no new consumer durable goods to buy : no automobiles , upon which the U.S. last year lavished $4 billion ; no refrigerators ( $550.000.000 ) ; no radios ( $520,000,000 ) , etc . But this is akin to " deferred maintenance . " The U.S. will have to get along with its old cars ; more people will have to wear their old clothes until they get a bit threadbare . Once the present enormous inventories of new goods are sold out , people wo n't be able to raise their standard of living with all sorts of new household gadgets . But , except where shipping bottlenecks or military conquest have restricted seaborne supplies ( like rubber ) , nothing has happened yet to indicate any cut worth speaking of in goods for daily ( or nondurable ) consumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 items , but none of the added rationing will bring real hardship . In fact , far from going back to 1932 , the U.S. will have on balance more goods to enjoy in the year of " suffering " 1943 than it had in riotous 1929 . Specifically : <P> The U.S. Will Be Fed . It has , and will have , more wheat than it knows what to do with ( TIME , June 22 ) , more vegetables , more meat and milk and fruit than it has ever had before . Despite Lend-Lease , the Agriculture Department of late has been so bothered with more milk , cheese and eggs than it had dared to hope for , for example , that it is urging people to eat more abundantly . The U.S. will have less sugar , coffee , tea , cocoa , tapioca , bananas and other imported foods to which it has become attached ; and domestic transportation troubles may mean doing without some delicacies from distant states . But from the standpoint of a balanced diet the U.S. will be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
