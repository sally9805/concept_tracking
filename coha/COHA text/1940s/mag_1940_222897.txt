Many a music student or musical amateur has itched to play a part in a fine symphony orchestra or string quartet . To give such amateurs a chance to play in professional company , a Viennese violinist named Fritz Rothschild four years ago invented a new kind of phonograph record . With other able professionals , Rothschild recorded standard classical quartets and sonatas . Each record was made with one part missing . For violinists he made a violinless quartet , for cello players a cello-less one . By playing one of these records , the lone amateur violinist or cellist could dub in his part as best he could , have the fun and profit of playing quartets with three top-notch virtuosos . If he made mistakes or got lost , all he had to do was stop the record . The idea caught on . Last year in the U. S. Gamut Recording Co. issued sololess accompaniments to Schumann 's Trumerei and Massenet 's lgie , complete with printed parts to be filled in by the player . <P> Meanwhile , on a visit to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of his old recordings , to Columbia . Columbia repressed some of the old Rothschild discs , made some new ones , last week issued a catalogue of " Add-a-Part " records , including pianoless and violinless sonatas for violin and piano , celloless and violaless string quartets . Columbia officials were bullish on their venture , foresaw Krupaless and Goodmanless hot records , possibly sololess " Sweet Adeline 's " for lonely drinkers .
