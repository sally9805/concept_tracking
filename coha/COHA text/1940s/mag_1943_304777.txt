By a Senate vote of 49-to-30 , the Ruml plan captured its Bizerte and Tunis . But the Administration was still fighting , and further resistance was due in the House this week . The President might still veto it , with a scorching philippic calculated to produce plenty of ammunition for 1944 . In strong marching orders to his Congressional tax leaders this week , he threatened as much . <P> But in view of the narrow margin ( four votes ) by which the House had previously rejected the plan , of the plan 's overwhelming popular support and of the universal agreement on the urgent need of a withholding tax , the Ruml plan seemed sure of victory-perhaps total , certainly partial . <P> Coming after one of the longest and bitterest tax fights in U.S. history , it was , like the Battle for Africa , a famous victory-particularly for an outsider like Beardsley Ruml , who has no standing in politics . <P> However much electioneering capital may be made of the fact that the Ruml plan " forgives " the rich ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes , the fact remains that taxes on all incomes over $25,000 a year comprise only a fraction of the estimated $9,275,000,000 to be forgiven . And because the war has increased most U.S. incomes , the Senate bill will net the Treasury this year an estimated $2,000,000,000 more revenue than it would receive under the old system of collecting this year 's taxes on last year 's incomes . <P> The Senate debate produced five alternatives to the Finance Committee-endorsed Ruml bill , all designed to soften the blow of new taxes or increased tax rates on the mass of voters , by some measure of doubling up on 1942 and 1943 tax payments . They were sponsored respectively by Senators from Louisiana , Georgia , Alabama and two from Texas . ( Average per capita income in these four states in 1940 was respectively $395 , $315 , $257 , and $411 , against a national average of $554 . ) <P> One by one these alternatives were rejected as the Senate majority held fast to the conviction that doubling up would place an impossible burden on most taxpayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair , it had to be tax forgiveness for all . The winning measure got 18 Democratic and 31 Republican votes , with 27 Democrats , two Republicans and one Progressive opposed . <P> Safeguards . To prevent war-brought windfalls , the Senate forgave each income-tax payer his obligation on one year 's income but required him to pay on either 1942 or 1943 incomes , whichever is higher . A second windfall provision is based on the proposition that if a citizen is making over $10,000 a year more than he did before the U.S. went to war , the surplus is to be considered war-caused , hence taxable . A taxpayer in this class adds $10,000 to the highest annual income which he received in either 1938 , 1939 , or 1940 , and pays the difference between the tax on this total and the tax which he escapes by the 1942-or-1943 cancellation . This payment is , of course , in addition to the full year 's tax which he must pay on 1942 or 1943 income , along with less prosperous citizens . <P> How It Works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxpayer will find himself operating under the following dispensation :
