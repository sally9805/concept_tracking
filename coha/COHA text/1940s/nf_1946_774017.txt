txt 6o Cleanliness and Godliness devised in addition , by human wisdom and forethought , Signor Boccaccio does not tell us , and we may doubt with good reason whether either drainage or the purity of the water supply received great attention among persons so devoid of the first elements of hygiene in their common way of living . And Boccaccio , who wrote from experience of this pestilence , gives testimony against the precautions of which he tells us when he records that those who walked abroad carried flowers , fragrant herbs and spices , from which they breathed the perfume , because ( he says ) the air seemed to be everywhere laden and reeking with the stench emitted by the dead and the dying , and the odour of drugs . Further Evidence to be considered in camera. ? There is also in the Heptameron of Marguerite , Queen of Navarre , a tale so nasty concerning a privy used by the Grey Friars that I take no joy in repeating it and will only say that such stories shew us the exceeding filthiness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been told , but that it should have been credible , to which fact there is later witness among the paintings of the elder Pieter Breughel , and , indeed , even later , in those of Rembrandt , shewing the nasty habits of the people as authors and artists viewed them . Of sauve qui peut and some Royal Examples. ? But what will you ? The physicians , so far from commending cleanliness , were often known to worship dirt more ardently than St. Agnes , of which truth we shall provide examples as late as the seventeenth century and after . Flight from disease was the only remedy understood by all ; and in this sovereign prophylaxis royalty and the rich , as the leaders of the community , neglected not to set an example , being the first to fly from disease , even as they are the first fugitives from war . From the town of Auxonne , where Margaret , Duchess of Bavaria , had fled from pestilence , in the // year 1414 , she writes to the rulers of Dijon her will and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them ? should presume to come to Auxonne , to which place we , together with our children , have repaired to escape-the- plague . Truly these were good foster-parents of their people ; for even in religion , which was their last hope , they gave the example of sauve qui peut , which was the only strategy known to medicine . Thus also Louis XI , threatened by the plague at Auxerre in the year 1479 , bids the monks at Dijon to pray for himself , the Dauphin and the Queen , and let prayers be said ( he adds , since one can not ask too much on these occasions ) for the good digestion of our stomachs and that neither wine nor meat may cause us indigestion and . that we may be preserved in good health . Well , there were two pagan deities who might have given some attention to this prayer , but their names are not mentioned . And having considered all that is proper and relevant to the question , I can not wonder at those who , seeing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be true Christians to be as they were ; for which cause they are called Chretiens , or Cretins , to this day . Concerning the Comforts of Constantinople. ? Throughout this time we do well to remember that the city of Constantinople enjoyed , under the Christian rulers of the Byzantine Empire , such convenience and comfort in all matters of hygiene and sanitation as were almost unknown throughout the rest of Europe . In addition to a regular system , of sanitation and an abundant supply of water , brought to the city by means of aqueducts , the people of Constantinople had the use of such baths as ancient Rome provided ; for these baths were common in the city and in general use among the populace during the whole life of Constantinople , from its foundation by the imperial proselyte to its capture by the Ottomans , when Roman baths // became Turkish . Of these baths Burton tells us in his Anatomy of Melancholy , on the authority of Gillius , that there were 155 at that time , under the rule of the Turks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is said that baths were constructed under the Byzantines where at the same time 7000 men might be cleansed . And of the hospitals of these Byzantines we read that they were well equipped with elaborate preparations for washing , that they knew the use of soap , which was supplied to the patients when they bathed , twice in the week ; also , concerning their provision for natural necessities , the Justinian Code had a special section under Lib. vu1 , tit. 10 , de aedificiis privatis , which seems to have been adequate and hygienic . And as to that scurrilous writer who rendered the Justinian maxim Cuicum jus tribuere as meaning To every one his own juice , I say he lied . But whilst the Christian light shone beneath a bushel at Byzantium , that of the Moors in Spain gave to the European continent such light as it could receive . We read of the University of Cordoba as the ornament of the world , to which students would travel from the furthest lands of Christendom . And men have said that the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byzantines , as though the scholars of Constantinople had all walked out of the back door with their books . But as well might a man say it began when the Moors were chased from Spain and the Inquisitors sat in their seats of judgement . I will warrant no New Learning ever came by Turks sacking a Christian city or by Christians looting a Moorish university ; but if a man will dig deeper he will find this same New Learning was pursued by Frederick Hohenstaufen , King of Sicily and Emperor of Almaine , whom they called Stupor Mundi . This Frederick learnt from the Moors and Saracens and fostered many arts and sciences ; and I doubt not a trickle of wisdom began to run into the system of // Europe out of Arabia , Egypt and other lands of the Saracens through this opening in Sicily more than two hundred years before Constantinople fell to the Ottomans . For what we call the Middle Ages long had the Renaissance in its belly . The Civilisation of the Moors in Spain and the Wisdom of their Physicians. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these Ibn Zohr was the most famous . This Ibn Zohr was a greedy eater of green figs , and it is written that on a certain occasion his brother physician , Al Far , reproached his greed , saying that so many figs would cause an abscess in his stomach . But Ibn Zohr answered that Al Far , through abstaining from figs , would die of fever and constipation . And how wise these physicians were may be known from the fact that IbnZohr died of an abscess and Al Far of fever and constipation , each justifying the other . In the city of Cordoba were 300 public baths , and the purest water was conveyed from the mountains , which water was distributed among the houses of the people by means of leaden pipes . In these houses of the citizens there were to be found bathrooms with water , both hot and cold . And the art of cleansing fabrics was studied , for the courtier Zaryab , besides being a very learned man , a great musician , an amateur gardener , a leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epicure skilled in culinary matters , did not disdain to attend to washingday . From him the Moors learnt , in the time of Charlemagne , the art of bringing linen to a perfect whiteness , and for this he was much praised , for the Arabs at that time were called the cleanest people upon earth . And these things I learn from the work of Lady Lugard , which she calls A Tropical Dependency ; for she says that such was the reputation of the Arabs in all that related to their persons , dress , beds and the interior of their houses . And it was said of them // that they carried cleanliness so far that it was not an uncommon thing for a man of the lower orders to spend his last coin on soap rather than to buy food for his daily consumption , and thus he would go without his dinner rather than appear in public in dirty clothes . But of their system of sanitation I can find no record , though I doubt little that among such people it was worthy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Christians. ? While much ? of Moorish building remains to bear witness to a cultured society that lasted fully seven hundred years , the Christians in the first fury of victory pulled down their baths as temples of the body which they abhorred ; for their rulers issued orders to this purport for the reformation , as they said , of the Moriscos . And in these orders it was commanded that neither themselves , their women nor any other persons , should be permitted to wash or bathe themselves either at home or elsewhere ; and that all their bathing-houses should be pulled down and destroyed . That this zeal against cleanliness was not always found among the Christians of Spain is nevertheless shewn by the laws of Teruel , in Aragon , in the twelfth century . For in this Christian town there was a public bath at that time , such as few Christian towns possessed ; and it was enacted that for three days of the week it should be used by Christian men , two days being set aside for their women and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , male and female . But upon Sundays , in reverence ( they said ) to the resurrection of our Lord , the Bath was not to be heated . This bath was cheap to all and free to servants or children . Apologia pro libello meo. ? This shall suffice for our account of the Middle Ages , concerning which much more might be written , but rather to nauseate you than to elevate your minds to certain purposes which I have in my // own , which is my present intention . For believe me , you shall find in this record the very mirror of human evolution , viz. the progress of man from the primitive to the artificial , with all the attendant problems , crises , neuroses , nemesis and what have you that are to be found in the march of civilisation itself . And if you will continue to bear with me while we build up our historical pyramid , there will be things worth seeing from its summit ; all of which I shall shew forth in good time if the bombs do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . But as things are , I can thank God and the Chelsea Borough for three pounds ten a week , and all for sitting in an A.R.P . depot writing of baths and lavatories ; and in this I hope to continue without interruption till my purpose is achieved , though every critic should say that I have made an ivory Tower of Ajax and buried my head in worse than sand . CAPUT V Of the Coming of Ajax Now upon the College of St. Mark and St. John , where I have my lodging , Phoebus Apollo , in glittering shafts of October benediction , sheds his silent blessing . The air is still , and sleepers in Whitehall stir in their dreams to wake and mutter : Has Moscow fallen ? But still no shrieking siren rends the illusion of security . They sleep again , and I resume my story in an Indian Summer of deceptive peace . Reflections upon the Seat of a Privy , discovered by the Author. ? But yesterday , what time I shovelled the wreckage of some Chelsea citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellar , I found among the mounds of refuse a lavatory seat , anonymous as its owner . Alas , poor Yorick ! Perchance it was the handiwork of Thomas Crapper , auspiciously named the leading sanitary engineer of the Borough , but there was no mark upon it ; symbol of the useful arts , destroyed by the diabolical sciences , we threw it to the flames . And there , as the fire consumed it , this seat that had ministered , it may be , to the comfort of generations , set me pondering once more the unheroic history of man , written in sanitary progress . But , musing thus , there came to my mind the excellent precept , adapted from Terence , which you will find cited by Sir John , or ( as he would have us believe ) by his accomplished servant , in the margin of his Metamorphosis : Humani nihil a me alienum puto. 66 // A Purple Passage , by no means to be skipped. ? Oh , Great Age , that had room and scope of spirit to nourish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Devon 's double shores ; to give us a whole nest of poets and play-writers , almost our only music , and the men who scattered an Armada ; to fortify our souls with boisterous prose and the trumpet of a heroic pentameter , to comfort our poor bodies by reviving the Minoan miracle , the flushed water-closet ! Here indeed were men whose genius , though nurtured in the perils of war , scorned not to be the servant of human happiness nor turned from the homelier task . In these pages shall names as forgotten as those of the owner and the maker of the seat I but recently excavated live once more for your admiration ; but first we will consider their fathers , those earlier Tudor gallants , and their great contemporaries , not forgetting the discoverers of a New World , the illustrious Dagoes . Behold , then , the England of Bluff King Hal , with a redrobed Cardinal mounted on his three-seated jakes . Against the stinks and infections of the courts he carries the customary ? what did they call the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ah , a pomander . Bad cess to him , I shall always imagine he wore woollen underwear beneath those great robes of his , the scheming bourgeois . The successor whose ambition he nourished deserves an even harsher censure , for no man did more than Thomas Cromwell to destroy the records of earlier ages , and that is to say nothing of heads that fell from the block . Ignominious Fate of many ancient Manuscripts. ? Now , if there is one bigger falsehood than the story of culture diffused by the capture of Constantinople , it is the notion that the monks sat tight upon all learning , which the Reformers dispensed to the commonwealth at the dissolution of the monasteries . John Leland lived at this time , our first antiquary , and he was so disturbed by the wholesale // destruction of these same valuable documents by those to whom Thomas Cromwell was giving the religious houses , that he wrote to Cromwell in the year 1535 , begging to be permitted to collect all manuscripts for the King 's Library . Some , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( according to Leland ) were filched by German scholars ? aha , the omnipresent Hun in history ! ? but of the rest Bishop Bale , old Bilious Bale , wrote as follows in his preface to The Laborious Journey and Search of J. Leylande for England 's Antiquities , an edition published in 1549 : A great number of them which purchased these superstitious mansions reserved of those Library books , some to serve their fakes , some to scour their candlesticks . So , then , that was no doubt the true fate of the knowledge long stored by mediaeval monks and delivered by Cromwell to the keeping of the Protestant nouveaux riches . But here is a Dutchman who should tell us something of the country , having seen it as the onlooker views the game . Erasmus condemns our Houses. ? Of the houses in England in the time of the eighth Henry , that shrewd observer Erasmus wrote that Englishmen built their chambers in such a way as to admit of no ventilation . And that he speaks here of the houses of the rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great part of the walls of the house , he says , is occupied with glass casements , which admit light but exclude the air . As to the floors , he says they are in general laid with white clay and covered with rushes , occasionally removed , but that so imperfectly that the bottom layer is undisturbed sometimes for twenty years , harbouring abominations not to be mentioned . To these observations Erasmus adds certain proposals for the improvement of English houses to make them more healthy , and in these he shews an understanding of both deficiencies and remedies . // That there was some small interest in the public health may be judged from certain prosecutions at this time . For in the year 1512 the Mayor of Nottingham was summoned for selling herrings unfit for consumption and for beginning a muck-hill . Also the father of William Shakespeare was later ( an . 1552 ) fined for depositing refuse in the street , and again in 1558 for failing to keep clean his gutters . But Mr. Jack Lindsay , in his introduction to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the foul conditions which made the labours of Sir John so timely , necessary and praiseworthy . The first of these is Stow 's account of Petty France , where there was in his time a ditch filled up ( he says ) with unsavoury things , to the danger of empoisoning the whole city . And secondly , Mr. Lindsay gives items for complaints brought before the Manor Court of Castle Combe in Wiltshire , an . 159o ; when it was necessary to forbid soiling in the churchyard and streets , and to order the removal of dung or filth from the house of one , John Davis . The Dearth o ? Privies continues. ? Such , indeed , was what we should expect to find ; for it is upon record that in the year 1579 there were but three privies in Tower Street , in the Parish of All Hallows , supplying the needs of near sixty houses and eighty-five people . Which may , I suppose , be tabled as an improvement upon the state of certain rents in the Basinghall Ward in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the householders were constrained to throw all their filth into the street . This method of sewage disposal was common enough and long remained in vogue . Amerigo Vespucci expresses his Disapproval of certain Islanders. ? It may be observed that Europeans at this time , whilst they allowed but little importance to matters of sanitation , made much of appearances . For the great Florentine , Amerigo Vespucci , in his account of his 7o Cleanliness and Godliness voyages , says of the islanders whom he found at the beginning of his first voyage that they were a people of neat exterior and clean of body , because of so continually washing themselves as they did . And when , says he , saving your reverence , they evacuate the stomach , they do their utmost not to be observed ; and as much as in this they are cleanly and bashful , so much the more are they filthy and shameless in making water ; since , while standing speaking to us , without turning around or shewing any shame , they let go their nastiness , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More , who with so much wit and wisdom described his Utopia , had no more to say concerning the cruder problems of sanitation in that country than a few words for the debasement of precious metals , lest men should covet them . For he says that of gold and silver ( in that country ) they commonly make chamber-pots and other vessels that serve for most vile uses , not only in their common halls but in every man 's private house . And this he says in despite of gold , not for the honour of sanitation and greater care thereto . So also my lord Verulam , when he writes Of Buildings , for all his cunning in things of a practical character , makes only an ambiguous mention of offices , whereof he treats not in detail . Nevertheless he may be called a martyr of hygiene who caught his death experimenting in refrigeration , an art known in ancient India for the preservation of corruptible matter , but long lost to the world . Of the Contempt in which the Tartars held the Chris-. tians. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voyage which he made ( an . 1556 ) as servant to Master Richard Chancelour . And he speaks of the Tartarians , which be Mahumetans , and live in tents and wagons , and keep in herds and companies ; and they hold it not good , he says , to abide long in one place , for they will say , when they curse any of their children , I would thou mightest tarry Of the Coming of Ajax 7I so long in a place that thou mightest smell thine own dung , as the Christians do , ; and this is the greatest curse that they have . This is written among the Principal Navigatio'ns , Voyages , Traffics and Discoveries of the English Nation , compiled by the indefatigable Hakluyt , and shows the contempt which a civilised nomad might feel for those that dwell in cities , if these be not kept sweet . Thus the Essenes in ancient times avoided the cities of the Jews ; for they said that just as foul air breeds disease , so the soul contracts disease from bad associations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And here I will mention another matter recorded among Hakluyt 's Principal Navigations , concerning the excellent practice of the Chinese in the use of dung , which we shall consider in its proper place in extenso. as one of the problems of our age . In a report on China , done out of Italian into English by one , Richard Willes , you will find these words : Here ( he says ) be sold the voidings of close stools , although there wanteth not the dung of beasts , and the excrements of man are good merchandise throughout all China . The dung farmers seek in every street by exchange to buy this dirty ware for herbs and wood . The custom is very good for keeping the city clean . How good it was for other purposes also we have yet to discuss ; but I may mention here that this custom of the Chinese still obtains ; and that commercial gentleman who was sent to Cathay by a company of merchants engaged in the sale of chemical fertilisers , found that for this reason he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an urgent request for information , after six months of silence , he was constrained to cable to his employers that he had 400,000,000 competitors . But we must return to Tudor England . As to the cleanliness of the body , it is said with reason in the Novum Organum that this has always been allowed to proceed // from moral modesty and reverence ; first , towards God , whose creatures we are , next , towards society , wherein we live , and lastly , towards ourselves , whom we ought to reverence still more than others . But when this was written it was but a hope for the future and no picture of the present . Thus Sir Walter Besant makes mention , in his History of London , of the diseases that scourged the city of London in the thirty-eight years while Henry VIII reigned in England . ( For there was in that time a return of the Plague from the year 1517 to 1522 and of the Sweating Sickness in 1518 and again in 1528 , with the Plague once more in 1543 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange thing that no physician spied the true cause of these diseases , the foulness of the narrow streets , the cesspools without number , the refuse and the putrefying blood of slaughtered beasts . Concerning Sir Francis Drake and the Uses of Parliamentary Privilege. ? A little was done by the Elizabethans for the better provision of water in certain towns , and notably in Plymouth , where to this day ( for all that I know ) the Mayor and Corporation inspect their ancient works and drink in water to the pious memory of Sir Francis Drake ; after which toast they have been wont to drink in wine to his descendants ( of which he left none ) , saying , may the descendants of him who brought us water never lack wine . But this custom is not of such antiquity as some have thought it to be , and it may be doubted if those who knew that old pirate thought so well of him . For Sir Francis ( when not upon the high seas ) sat in Parliament in those days for the borough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House to consider the Plymouth Water Bill , he may be suspected of having had some hand in amending it to his advantage . This we know , that the Bill being drawn up by the burgesses of Plymouth , to fetch water from the River Meavy , with // much talk of ships that harboured at Plymouth , this Bill was amended with some mention of water mills . So that where the burgesses spoke of their own need and those of the ships , more especially in time of war , the amendment made it to include a proviso concerning the erection of mills and the appropriation of water for that purpose . Let the reader judge the meaning of this from the fact that Sir Francis was the sole member of that Committee which so amended the Bill who had any interest in the matter , or in Plymouth , and that he even then leased the Corporation Manor Mills at Millbay . Sir Francis therefore established a sound interest in this matter , beyond the sum of ? ioo paid to him in compensation for land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done in furtherance of the plan , or , as the records say , for bringing in the water . The Leat which they made for this purpose was full seventeen miles in length and some six to seven feet in width , passing through mighty rocks which had been thought an impassable barrier to this enterprise . And within six months of completion we find that Sir Francis built upon the Leat six new mills , in accordance with the proviso in the amendment , from which he made enviable profits . Also we find that in the next year a further Bill was put forward in the Commons that these mills should be removed , and that Sir Francis was Chairman of the Committee which sat upon it , to such effect that it was heard of no more . Nevertheless , this matter of the Leat was a great undertaking , worthy of the enterprise of the Elizabethans ; and many conduits they made from the Leat , of which one bore the motto Redigit desertum in stagnum . But the men of Plymouth would suffer those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of their water ; and Boswell records the language used by Doctor Johnson in this matter . For he , while on a visit to Plymouth ( an . 1762 ) , affected , says Boswell , to entertain // the passions of the place , exclaiming , No , no , I am a Plymouth man . Rogues , let them die of thirst . They shall not have a drop . Thus Plymouth , on account of its importance to our ships in a great age of seamen , was among the first towns to supply itself with wholesome water from a distance ( though Hull can claim the first honour by a long lead ) , and as it is today , so it was then , we find a man profiting from the matter in such a way that what was undertaken for public use was made the occasion of private gain . Queen Bess is shewn to have bathed more frequently than King John. ? As to baths , these remained a rarity . But Gloriana had bathrooms installed at Windsor , and there ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month whether she required it or not . This , as I suppose , shewed some advancement since the time of King John ; but the speed of such progress would hardly even have alarmed the Fabian Society or that deceased apostle of Gradualism whose policies still govern the desperate revolutionaries of our time . Mr. H. A. J. Lamb , it is true , has reproduced in the Architects ' Journal for March 4th , 1937 , a drawing from a sixteenth-century manuscript shewing that about this time promiscuous bathing was practised to , the accompaniment of music , in which some must have indulged their fancy . But for the most part such practices were unknown . Wash your hands often , your feet seldom , your head never , ran the English proverb of the period , scorning even to mention the chance of other parts being washed ; and the most we can hope is that at least the first instruction carried a little weight with it . Few indeed can have been so fastidious as that criminal of whom Montaigne tells us , who on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the hangman , for fear he caught the pox ; and does not Montaigne himself remark upon the foul stenches of Paris in his essay on smells and odours ? // The excellent Precepts of Dr. Andrew Boorde. ? Among the first to shew an empirical understanding of the principles of health was Andrew Boorde , who was born in the year 1490 and died in 1549 , having learnt medicine in the universities of Europe and practised in this country . This man was learned in much that has escaped the attention of physicians until the present time , for he said that a good cook is half a physician and that the chief physic ( the counsel of the physician excepted ) doth come from the kitchen . For this cause he ordained that the physician and the cook should consult together ; also he held that a man should be his own best physician , to consider the thing which did him good . And in the principles of psychology this Andrew Boorde chewed himself a master , for in his Breviary of Health he praises mirth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doth comfort the heart so much , beside God , as honest mirth and good company . Thus he considers the state of mind as of first importance to the preservation of health , for he says that the heart doth vivi Gate all other members and is the ground and foundation of all the vital spirits in man . Also in his book called The Dietary of Health he says that if the eye be not satisfied , the mind can not be contented , which being so , the heart can not be pleased . If the heart ( he says ) and mind be not pleased , nature doth abhor , and if nature do abhor , mortification of the vital and animal and spiritual powers do consequently follow . In this book he says , moreover , that mirth and rejoicing do lengthen a man 's life and expel sickness . But enough of this , for once more we digress from the true object of our passion . Let us return to fundamentals and resurrect among the Elizabethan giants the figure of AJAX , but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have no meaning and my book itself would never have been brought to birth . Lend force and // sweetness to my words , Stercutius and Cloacina , BaalPeor and Tlacolteotl , deities of sanitation and fertility ; and rise , ye genii , banished from Mohammed 's paradise , who frequent the smallest chambers of our houses ; for I would pay the neglected tribute of an ungrateful nation to the greatest of its sons , the foremost of its inventors , the most accomplished and versatile genius since the Moorish Zaryab , saving only Leonardo da Vinci . The Royal Descent of Sir John Harington. ? A royal bar sinister missed the house of Harington by no more than a hair 's breadth . Lightly dispersed in bastardy , the seed of lusty Henry , amid the changing fortunes of marriage , had begotten without benefit of wedlock the lady who became the first wife of Harington pere . Alas , she died barren , like so many of those dried-up tender shoots , and Harington fils was the fruit of a second marriage . If his conception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been nearer to such honour , with a Virgin Queen for his godmother . Posterity alone , his legitimate heir and assign , neglects with the ingratitude of oblivion the sanitary messiah for whom the far-seeing fates decreed the spiritual motherhood of Great Elizabeth . His Upbringing and Accomplishments. ? A father also was provided for this prodigy by the eugenics of predestination who shared the spoils of the monks and at Kelston observed the rules of hygiene with untimely zeal . Did he not forbid the making of water within either of his courtyards on pain of a fine , namely , the sum of one penny ? And was not this one-quarter of the sum mulcted from those who toyed with the maids ? Such rules , with one that forbade the teaching of any unhonest speech or bawdy word to the children , you will find in the Nugae Antiquae , compiled by the labours of the Rev. Henry Harington from the dusty manuscripts of the period . Trained // in such a tradition of cleanliness and decency , John Harington grew to the stature of manhood to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required , to be : a wit , a soldier , a courtier and a poet . But not content with such trivial plumes , the royal blood in his veins demanded no less distinction than Supremacy ; and this he discovered as an inventor . Where is the man today who , with rank and beauty waiting upon his ready tongue , a queen for his audience , a court for his auditorium , and an archbishopric for his ambition , will turn aside from such fripperies , go to the bottom of things , and concern his mind with a sanitary convenience ? Where is the inventor who , having devised such a thing of utility , will write you a book full of wit and wisdom to advertise his product with all the rich store of classical scholarship and the entertainment of a jester 's tongue ? Such a man was Sir John , such a book The Metamorphosis of Ajax , published in 1596 , which carried with it a complete plan of the first modern valve watercloset . Sir John held to scorn in Ulysses Upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find among the curious works of the age which is called Ulysses Upon Ajax , a criticism of Sir John and his book , though some believe that Harington himself wrote it ? a custom not uncommon at the time and in later years , before the late Joynson-Hicks and James Douglas were sent into the world to do for authors what they had formerly to do for themselves . The unknown author of Ulysses certainly shared Sir John 's taste for a certain type of literature , especially the works of the Sieur de Brocourt ; for he knew his way through the Serees de Guillaume Bouchet . But whether he was in fact Sir John himself , or look we for another , he said plainly that Harington 's metamorphosed Ajax was a notion cribbed from Vitruvius , or else ( he said ) taken from a traveller 's mouth // who bath seen the Cardinal of Ferrara 's buildings at Tivoli . As to that , no life of Sir John has yet been written to con-sult upon this point , and for my part I have other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispute until I have leisure to turn biographer or a better man steps in be-fore me . All that I know is , if Sir John was not in fact the inventor , he was the first in this country to imitate the invention ; and how rare a spirit was his may be seen from the small number of those who followed his example , though inspired by a book of such great worth and charm . But I am inclined myself to think that Sir John wrote Ulysses himself in self-deprecation , to stir up controversy ; and among the many similarities of style and vocabulary I have noticed that both Sir John and the anonymous author use the term Bocardo to denote a jakes , a use of that word which I have not found in any other writings , and unknown to such dictionaries as I have consulted , wherein its secondary uses are confined to jail-houses . Gloriana honoured him , but his Name was writ in Water. ? Peace be to his bones . The Queen herself , a prac-tical woman if ever there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invention to be installed . at Richmond Palace , with a copy of her godson 's book hanging upon the wall . But to his contemporaries Sir John 's invention was a jest , and he a prophet without honour in his own country . Suc-ceeding generations forgot both ; and when the water-closet made its appearance once more in our houses , the very name of the genius to whom this most beneficial of all inventions is due had passed from human memory . Too truly had it been writ in water . Even the Dictionary of National Biography does him no justice , the edition of 1890 recording that his style resembled Sterne at his worst . Devices considered by Sir John for the Reformation of Privies. ? The great Harington in his book sets forth the // many reflections and experiments which preceded the metamorphosis . Thus he tells us that one taught an excellent rule to keep a chimney from smoking and a privy from stinking , viz. to make your fire in your privy and to set the close-stool in the chimney . But this method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that used in his house at Lincoln 's Inn , where vents drew off the evil odours ; but this too failed to satisfy him , because he found the wind so unruly , it would at times drive the ill airs down his vents , and not draw them up . Therefore Sir John devised a privy where water should be employed to carry away the filth , for which reason he offered to be Admiral of such projects . And in his sudden discovery of this excellent device this rear-admiral likened himself to Archimedes ( as well he might , being at least as deserving an engineer ) but protested that he did not imitate Archimedes in leaving his employment ( for we may conjecture what he was at ) to cry Eureka about the town with his hose about his heels . Rather did this apostle of Sanitation soberly set down with plans , costs and the most complete instructions the manner in which a valve water-closet ( such as he caused to be made in his own house at Kelston , near Bath ) was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the Haringtonian revelation ; and we , who have yet to consider the filthiness of physicians in the time of the Plague , with all the dirt and disease to which we are still the heirs , may well marvel at this man 's sagacity . For he sets it down that many physicians held in his time ( though surely these must have been the exceptions ) that the plague , the measles , the haemorrhoids , the smallpox , and perhaps the great ones too , with the fistula in ano , and many of those inward diseases , are no way sooner gotten than by favour of other excrements upon 8o Cleanliness and Godliness unwholesome privies . To this testimony he adds that of the School of Salerno , which we have already noticed . New Laurels for Old Ajax. ? A later age has but begun to do scant justice to this neglected genius . Mr. Gerald Heard , writing of a multitude of things under the title Narcissus , An Anatomy of Clothes , has proclaimed the use of a flush system of drainage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rank beside the steam engine . And in Sir John he observes his almost Minoan figure , calling him a typical Elizabethan ( which he was not , for he far outstripped them all , and they did not so much as follow where he had led ) . But it is none the less of note to find even a bare mention of Harington and his achievement , which Mr. Heard rightly describes as the re-invention of the Minoan 's masterpiece . Or let the curious examine the story of Sir Ferdinando in that excellent novel Chrome Yellow , by Mr. Huxley , and he will find in this book a very pretty picture of an Elizabethan gentleman who invented a privy , to be flushed by water , and wrote on this subject a work ( now said to be rare ) entitled Certaine Privy Counsels by One of Her Majestie 's Honourable Privy Counsel . Who is here indicated but our old friend Sir John , the true original of the fictitious Ferdinando ? But alas , few who read Mr. Huxley are privy to this secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health we know from his translation of The School of Salerne , setting forth the precepts of that famous College of Medicine , such as the cleansing of the teeth after eating , as a protection against the worms which our forefathers believed to be the cause of the toothache .

But Lilliput had at the least One Hygienic Statute. ? Lilliput was no Utopia , but we may at this point observe that the court of that kingdom was protected by laws similar to those devised by the elder Harington for his household , though more drastic in the penalties which they imposed . For there was a statute in this country by which it was enacted that whoever should make water within the precincts of the royal palace should be liable to the pains and penalties of high treason .

Much sewage has flowed into the sea since Sir John wrote his memorable but unremembered work ; and , like all // great inventions , the water-closet ( no less than the aeroplane ) is used rather for destruction than for human welfare . This we shall discuss in good time ; but first we have other things to consider and to these we will devote an undivided attention , lest in the words of the French proverb , Entre deux arcouns chet cul a terre .

A vain Search for the Commode of Louis XIV ? Mais ou sont les neiges d'antan ? ? Here in distant India the Shah Jahangir holds his audiences in magnificent baths . Not so will you find the Court of Versailles , where there is great filthiness , and I am credibly informed that no privies existed even in the time of the Grand Monarque ; but commodes are here in use , and upon one such sits Louis XIV , with his courtiers about him . In the pale hope of setting eyes upon that celebrated throne , the seat of such formidable majesty , I journeyed but recently to the Victoria and Albert Museum , where ( as I had been told ) it was still to be found . Others shall verify and write learned footnotes for future generations , exposing the vanity of my quest or justifying it , according to the decree of the Weird Sisters .

Where is the pot de chambre Great Louis carried in his coach of state , if another rumour be true ? Never , surely , did the pick and shovel of research function in such a black-out , or learning contend with such barbarism ; the very Reading Room of the British Museum is closed , and has been so these many months , a mishap lamented by every scholar in the Tramps ' University , the free school of all the arts and sciences where once I sat among my peers , those ragged buccaneers of Pallas Athene .

For example , in Madrid , about this time , the mobile privy makes its appearance ; pulled through the streets and heralded by a crier , it seeks to supply the lamentable needs of the city . Alas , I have excited your curiosity in vain , for all my efforts have not as yet unearthed the details of its meteoric career . But of decency as understood in the island of Madeira I find this account by the Rev. John Ovington , writing of his Voyage to Surat in the year 1689 . When the Company breaks up ( he says ) the Porches and Entries of the Houses , and particularly the private place behind the door , are allowed for the convenience of Urine ; because that action in the streets is reputed Indecent and liable to the Censure of Drunkenness .

As to our own country , Pepys has recorded the perils of the passer-by in the London streets of an evening ; filth was precipitated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be counted fortunate who had only the stench to endure . ( Was this , perchance , the true origin of male gallantry , that still chooses the outside of the pavement ? ) Here was a fine target for the satirist , and John Gay describes it for us in his Trivia , presenting to us the dirt , mire , mud and slime of the City , augmented by those slops that descended from the overhanging casements , telling us of ... Cloacina , goddess of the tide Whose sable streams beneath the city glide . And Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace reminds me in his work , The Wonderful Century , of those lines of Swift : Sweepings from butchers ' stalls , dung , guts and blood , Drown 'd puppies , stinking sprats , all drench 'd in mud , Dead cats and turnip-tops come tumbling down the flood . From such filth , says Mr. Wallace , only the larger streets were ever cleaned , the houses also having , for the most part , cesspools close behind or underneath them . But there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , offering evidence even more grim than you will find in the third satire of Juvenal , describing the streets of Rome in the early days of its decline . State of the Privies and Observations of Boswell and Johnson. ? An anonymous scribbler of the period , who wrote certain Meditations upon An House of Office , gives us ( together with a terrible description of a jakes ) certain observations regarding Scotland which at first I hardly credited . For first he tells of a privy where he saw , among other objects , the leg of a child , which put him in mind of fornication , mother of the greater sin of murder . For this reason , says he : I could not but admire the wise Institution of the Scotch Nation , which will not suffer any such destructive Chasms ( he means Jakes ) within the limits of // their Kingdom . But chancing myself upon the edition of Boswell 's Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides , first pub-lished from the original MS. in 1936 , by the labours of Frederick Pottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks . Boswell describes the streets of Edinburgh as perilous and odoriferous , and the throw-ing of foul water from the windows had but recently been forbidden . But what is of greater interest is his surprise upon finding an ingenious privy at Brochel Castle . I did not imagine ( he says ) the invention had been introduced into Scotland till in very modern days . The contrivance he describes would by us be considered simple enough , being merely a hole set over an abyss , but Boswell claims that such conveniences were still rare among the Scots , who ( as Dr. Johnson expressed it ) took very good care of one end of a man , but not of the other . Boswell rightly concluded from his observations at Raasay ( where the owner of Brochel Castle had no privy of his own ) that an ancient art had fallen into disuse ; for which cause he upbraided his host as being less civilised than his ancestors . In a lost passage of the journal Boswell appears to have found a good Little House , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Coll , like Raasay , had an old jakes in the castle but none in the modern house , he took the matter so hard that the Doctor told him he had the Domus Taliskeriana much at heart . And on another occasion , when Johnson read through the journal , he informed Boswell that one of his faults was expatiating too much on the luxury of the little-house at Talisker . But this fault , says the observant sycophant , he mentioned as if he liked it . Yet modesty seems to have induced him to destroy the passage . Well , notwithstanding the preoccupations of Boswell , I would say that in these times any nation would have fared better to follow the custom of the Tartars ; and for a // further study of how our ancestors dealt with such things I refer you to that account by the Very Rev. Dean Swift of The Lady 's Dressing Room , and an obscure reply entitled The Gentleman 's Study . Surely it was from these times that a curious precedent survives whereby it is still permissible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case of necessity , without being considered to have committed a nuisance , as our strange phrase has it . This , I suppose , having once been universal custom , represents not a privilege acquired but a form of license preserved . A Poet praises the unregenerate Ajax. ? And now let us consider the once-bright streams that flow southward into mighty Thames , become the open sewers of the growing city , until , one by one , they are of necessity covered over . At Holywell , Clerkenwell and Aldgate Pump a man may drink of the fever and be thankful that he does not drink of the plague . As to washing or bathing themselves , Londoners knew little of such things until late in the last century . And their dying was as filthy and congested as their living ; for in the crowded cemeteries the dead lay so near to the surface that they infected the air of the churchyard , so that those who sought ministrations for their souls exposed their bodies to new perils . But who cares ? And has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as I suppose ) of no metamorphosed Ajax ( for the new model is still neglected ) , but the old , unseemly gong , the midden-privy of which so much , alas , must be written in this truthful tale ? When London was rebuilt after the Great Fire , an Act was passed in Parliament making provisions as to the height of houses , the breadth of streets , the construction of sewers and the prohibition of noisome trades . And doubtless a little was effected by such means , though more , it is believed , by the great heat of the fire which destroyed all // sources of infection and cleansed the long-festering sores of corruption . But had Sir Christopher Wren been permitted to undertake the remodelling of the City with a free hand , the tale had been a different one indeed , for he prepared a great plan which had without doubt been put into execution but for the opposition of many private interests . John Evelyn also planned for the rebuilding of the city , and both plans were made with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was permitted to accomplish did much to improve the metropolis , but we may be sure those who prevented a greater achievement regretted that they could not create again their infinity of ancestral frowsiness and infection . In the year 1720 a certain Dr. Richard Mead published a Short Discourse concerning Pestilential Contagion in which he not only advocated a better and more humane system of isolating infected persons than that hitherto in use , but spoke plain language upon the necessity of houses and streets being kept clean . For as nastiness , he said , is a great source of infection , so cleanliness is the greatest preservative . And in the year 1752 there was published a book by Sir John Pringle , then Physician-General to the British Forces , who ( under the title of Observations on the Diseases of the Army in Camp and Garrison ) exposed the dangers arising from filth and foul air in the propagation of many diseases . Yet so little progress was made that a hundred years later we read of soldiers living in barracks condemned as unfit for habitation ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filth , and of a death rate in the army very much higher than that of the civil population , due to the diseases from which the soldiers suffered even more than civilians . Of sluttish Customs among the Fops and their notorious Ignorance. ? The eighteenth century concealed with perfume and powder the fact that it was filthy and stank , and // its predecessor was no sweeter . For as Herrick says to the lady : From Powders and Perfumes keep free ; Then shall we know how sweet you be . In the very dining-rooms where fops paraded their lace and their powdered perruques , there were built cupboards with shelves to contain chamber-pots ; so that , having besotted themselves with liquor , these dandies might relieve themselves the more readily . Little indeed did such nastiness disturb their minds , for their filthiness was but the reflection of unimaginable ignorance . Did not the constable of Great Staughton , in the county of Huntingdon , record this item in his accounts for the year 1710 ? ?

Warning to those who would view them. ? Here , in a mansion planned for the Earl of Leicester at Norfolk , the architect ( who designed it in the year 1734 ) has arranged a sociable retreat for two , in a corner of the hall , without a window , so that it ventilates into the house . The metamorphosed Ajax is still neglected , though I am told that Horace Walpole makes some mention of such an apparatus in 176o . Not until the year 1775 is the first valve water-closet patented , the proud invention of Alexander Cumming , to be followed three years later by the patent of Joseph Bramah . An example of the first pan closet , produced in 1790 , may be seen with its heirs and successors at the Parkes Museum , where I recently viewed these exhibits ; and in the light of my own unfortunate experience I wrote some lines as a warning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may very properly be // brought to the reader 's attention at this point in case he should be of a mind to follow in my footsteps : All unashamed , on either hand , The by-gone water closets stand ; Oh , bitter cliche !

Repair , then , to this mausoleum of empty thrones if you would know the details of technique and construction , for here I have no place for such a collection . The early models were , for the most part , so constructed as to be easily fouled , and such few of them as were ever made can have brought but little improvement to the conditions of health where they were used . But once more we must pause to do honour to a royal example , presenting for your admiration the figure of Queen Anne sitting at Windsor upon a seat of Easement of Marble , with sluices of water to wash all down . Alas for England , we who have suffered so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the salutary lesson that two queens would have taught us . What , then , of the physicians ? Were there none to rank with those of Salerno and give us counsel against the infections arising from a jakes ? Rather they seem to have progressed backwards , but let us examine for a while their methods of diagnosis and cure , to see what hope there is here for improvement . For these are to be the new priests , carrying in their bags as many bodily remedies for a credulous public as the fat Pardoners once had of salves for their souls . We will therefore turn highwaymen , to hold up these pedlars and rifle their packs . Sir Thomas More jests with Death and the Doctors. ? I remember first a seemly story , which Sir John shall tell , as he will do so better than ever I could , concerning Sir Thomas More ; from which you may learn that a man may // be merry and still be canonised . For before his execution Sir Thomas ? or Saint Thomas , if you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for he could not live , called for his urinal , and having made water in it he cast it and viewed it ( as physicians do ) a pretty while ; at last he swore soberly that he saw nothing in that man 's water , but that he might live , if it pleased the King . A pretty saying , adds Sir John , both to note his own innocency and move the Prince to mercy . Judgement by Urine condemned as fraudulent. ? But Sir Thomas Browne in his Pseudodoxia Epidemica passes censure upon judgement by Urine and speaks of this practice in these words . Physicians , he says ( many at least that make profession thereof ) , besides divers less discoverable ways of fraud , have made them believe there is the book of fate or the power of Aaron 's breastplate in Urines . And therefore hereunto they have recourse as unto the Oracle of life , the great determinator of Virginity , Conception , Fertility and the Inscrutable infirmities of the whole Body . For as though there were a seminality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it carried with it the Idea of every part , they foolishly conceive we visibly behold therein the Anatomy of every particle , and can thereby indigitate their Diseases ; and , running into any demands , expect from us a sudden resolution in things , whereon the Devil of Delphos would demur ; and we know hath taken respite of some days to answer easier questions . If such was the ignorance and the pretentiousness of physicians in this country , as judged by one of their number distinguished for his sincerity , our amour pro pre demands to know more of the conditions upon the Continent , and here shall we behold such an abundance of brutish customs as should restore us in our self-esteem , though one honourable exception shall first be mentioned , Sanctorius Sanctorius , who taught at the University of // Padua in the time of the great Galileo . This philosopher appears to have spent much of his time in a weighing chair , and in the year 1614 published the results of his experiments and meditations under the title De Statica Medicina , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acumen : Insensible Perspiration alone discharges much more than all the servile Evacuations together . And again he says : If the Body increases beyond its usual weight , without eating or drinking more than customary , there must either be a Retention of some of the Sensible Excrement ( for so he terms those losses of which we are conscious ) or an Obstruction of the perspirable Matter . But the experimental methods of Sanctorius were no more common on the Continent of Europe than they were in this island ; as we will briefly shew from some examples of ignorance and superstition , resulting in the most filthy treatment of those who came under the care of physicians . Unsavoury Habits of the French. ? First , then , I commend to your attention Social France in the XVII Century , where Mlle Cecile Hugon will tell you something of French hospitals . Happy was the subject of Henry IV who , being sick , found the Hotel-Dieu too full for his admission and died in the streets ! For those , says our author , who had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bed with six other persons , all dying of different diseases . Indeed , an eyewitness even declared that at Rouen he had seen eight or ten persons in one bed , and often one living person in the midst of seven or eight who were dead . The incomes of such hospitals were augmented by selling the clothes of the dead to the poor of the city , by which means the demand for hospitals was assured at the same time as the supply ; and if this be the way in which France dealt with disease , we may more readily imagine the careless habits of the healthy . ( Moreover , if I remember aright , Victor // Hugo has something to say in Les Miserables on the subject of the Paris drains ; and to this day I can never smell drains without having a nostalgia for Paris , where this smell mingles with that of French tobacco and garlic to make the essential odour of the city . ) But Germany fared no better than France , as we may observe in the treatment there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , not in its first , but certainly in its most memorable visitation . Agreeable News of Moscow. ? It is astonishing to learn from the Cambridge Modern History that in the year 17o6 Peter the Great appointed Sanitary Inspectors in Moscow , one for every ten houses , and that in the same year the first modern hospital was built by the River Yanza , with a medical training school . This is strange news indeed , for I know of only two opinions regarding Russia : the present Russian and Communist opinion that civilisation began in the year 1917 , and the opinion of most Englishmen and Americans , that Russians were blackguards until the year 1941 , when they changed their morals , manners and habits in a single night , like Paul on the road to Damascus , becoming reconciled to the persecuted apostles of Threadneedle Street . Well , it seems we were all wrong , and the Russians had a few virtues before Mr. Pollitt found that they had changed their spots or My Lord Beaverbrook woke up to discover they had changed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That intrepid traveller . Dr. Clarke tells in his book of Travels in Russia , Tartary and Turkey , which was published in this country in the year 181o , of the baths which he found in Russia . These baths he described as being usually filled with vermin , and he observed that nothing could be more filthy and disgusting than one of these places . Nevertheless lie remarks of their neglect in England at that time that eminent physicians had endeavoured to draw the atten94 Cleanliness and Godliness tion of the English Government to the importance of public baths , and of countenancing their use by every aid of example and encouragement . For , says he , while we wonder at their prevalence among all the eastern and northern nations , may we not lament that they are so little used in our own country ? We might , perhaps , find reason to allow that erysipelas , surfeit , rheumatism , colds and a hundred other evils , particularly all sorts of cutaneous and nervous disorders , might be alleviated , if not prevented , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants of countries in which the bath is constantly used anxiously seek it in full confidence of getting rid of all such complaints , and that they are rarely disappointed . . I may add ( continues Dr. Clarke ) my testimony to others . I hardly know any act of benevolence more essential to the comfort of the community than that of establishing , by public benefaction , the use of baths for the poor in all our cities and manufacturing towns . The lives of many might be saved by them . In England they are considered only as articles of luxury ; yet throughout the vast empire of Russia , through all Finland , Lapland , Sweden and Norway , there is no cottage so poor , no hut so destitute , but it possesses its vapour bath , in which all its inhabitants , every Saturday at least , and every day in case of sickness , experience comfort and salubrity . Dr. Clarke then recalls that Lady Mary Wortley Montagu , in spite of all the prejudices which prevailed in England against inoculation , introduced it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of equal influence would endeavour to establish throughout Great Britain the use of warm and vapour baths , the inconveniences of our climate would be done away . Perhaps , the learned doctor concludes , at some future period they may become general ; and statues may perpetuate the memory of the patriot , the statesman or the sovereign to whom society will be indebted for their institution . // But he adds that when we are told that the illustrious Bacon lamented in vain the disuse of baths among the Europeans , we have little reason to indulge the expectation . In this matter Dr. Clarke did not consider the Russians to be Europeans , for , says he , the universal custom of the bath may be mentioned as an example of the resemblance between Muscovites and more oriental people . Discovery that the Irish were once accustomed to bathe . ? Of the jakes in use among these Muscovites Dr. Clarke says nothing , though I fear they were no better than those we shall describe later , the post-revolutionary privies of present-day Russia . But as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have read that in the Crimean War British soldiers were known to open the raiment of their fallen foes and admire the whiteness of their skins . Also we know that in the country of Finland it was , and still is , the habit of the people to follow a vapour bath with a bath in the snow , by which they shew their understanding of important principles . And of the Irish we learn that the bath was in use among them until the nineteenth century at least as a therapeutic measure , for the Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics , in an article on Disease and Medicine among the Celts , speaks of the use of the Sweat House by the Irish as a cure for the rheumatism . These sweathouses ( they say ) were commonly shaped in the manner of bee-hives , covered with clay and having a low entrance . They were heated by the burning of turfs , like a brick oven ; and the patient , having been cooked for a sufficient time , would on his emergence cool his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pool or stream . Gibbon appeared to ascribe the Decline and Fall of Rome to the Decadence of her Emperors in that they frequented Baths. ? The observations of Dr. Clarke and of other authors shew that the upper ranks of society among the English were not unaware of the value attached by others to the // use of the bath , and this was particularly the case among scholars in an age when the classics and classical history received so much more attention than they do today . But what says Gibbon , who refers with sufficient frequency to the baths in use among the Ancient Romans ? You will observe that he can scarcely mention them without appearing to read the Decline and Fall in every bather . Follow but his pages faithfully , and you will find his mind has divided the Emperors into two categories : those who bathed habitually to the detriment of the Empire , and those Good Emperors of whom he does not recall that they ever washed themselves in any particular . Truly , Seneca had here a worthy disciple . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those days of such a rarity and almost a scandal that when the Lord Mayor of London , as late as the year 1812 , asked for a shower bath , he was refused by the Common Council upon the excuse that previous Lord Mayors had done without . Public bathing was known , however , as we may learn from an illustration to TittleTattle , a seventeenth-century pamphlet , shewing that such establishments existed in the time of James I ( who set an ill example in all such matters ) . But in general bathing was believed to be a cause of numerous ailments , such as rheumatism ; and those who began to bathe themselves daily were threatened with the most fatal results . The Duke of Wellington , having learnt from the Hindus ( like others who had been to India ) the habit of daily bathing , was considered in this respect a fanatic ; and it was long before successive generations of civil and military officers who had acquired in India the practice of bodily cleanliness established it as a custom among the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title of The Great Unwashed which their descendants were to confer in ridicule upon the poor ; and deserved it better than those for whom the // name was invented , because they were de facto both great and dirty . The habit of the bath , when it eventually began to spread among our islanders , supposed for the most part the use of cold water for a display of courage , rather than of hot water for the purpose of hygiene , the use of hot water being generally regarded as effeminate in an early Victorian bath . The Thames as a Cesspool and . Source of London 's Water. ? We need mention but briefly the public works which improved sanitary conditions toward the end of the eighteenth century , when a beginning was made with better paving in. the streets , by their widening and the improvement of sewers , by an improved supply of water , the rebuilding of ancient houses and the increase of light and air . And in the nineteenth century there followed the replacement of water mains made of wood by those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house newly constructed . Yet , in spite of such improvements , we find that baths were still so rare that none was to be found in Buckingham Palace at the time of Victoria 's accession , whilst London sewage continued to be gathered into household cesses or was diverted into the Thames , which became itself a stinking cesspool . And since the City of London still drew from this cesspool the main supply of its water , we may leave the reader to his own reflections as to the result . In Bradford sewers did not exist in the year 1844 , while regulations enforced in Liverpool forbade the communication of house drains with the sewerage system . In Exeter whatever filth did not stay to fester in cesspools collected in the streets , where ( in accordance with the custom of the time ) the paving was pitched to create a kennel , or gutter , in the centre . And the refuse that was to be found there was gathered by contractors , who paid ? 63 in annual rent for the soil thus obtained , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never removing any filth // until the quantity was sufficient to remunerate them with profit for the cost of labour employed . Such was the condition of Exeter in the year 1832 , when Asiatic cholera arrived in the city , resulting in a tardy decision to improve the water supply and to lay down thirteen miles of sewers , with other measures of a sanitary character . Of Bristol at this time we read that 1300 out of 3000 houses had still no water ; of Leeds , that whole streets floated with sewage . Of Sanitation in the Political Battlefield. ? Radical opinion , even at that very hour of history forcing the Reform Bill through a resentful Upper Chamber , was not neglectful of such social evils . A broadside that bears the imprint of J. W. Peel , Printer , of 9 , New Cut , Lambeth , asks peremptorily , Has DEATH ( in a rage ) been invited by the Commissioners of Common Sewers to take up his abode in Lambeth ?

Oh , Heaven ! that such companions thou'dst unfold . And put in every honest hand , a whip , To lash the rascals naked through the world . The writer concludes that unless something be speedily done to allay the growing discontent of the people , retributive justice in her salutary vengeance will commence her operations with the Lamp-Iron and the Halter . This declaration of popular resentment at the neglect of public health is signed Salus Populi and bears the heroic date of 1832 . A Country Town decides that Health is not necessary. ? // Of the complacency of rural authorities we may take as an example the history of Beaminster , a small town in the county of Dorset . From the History of Beaminster , written by one Richard Hine and published in the year 1914 , we may learn of various pestilences , such as the Plague in the seventeenth century and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smallpox and the precaution of inoculation . But in spite of such scourges and the recommendation by the Board of Guardians ( an . 1854 ) that a Board of Health should be set up in the parish , we read that a resolution was carried unanimously by the Vestry Meeting to this effect , that there is no necessity for the establishment of a Board of Health in this parish . And though in the year 1866 such a Board was eventually established , and from the year 1885 attention was paid to remedy a defective water supply , the local Chronicles could still record in the year 1914 that the sanitary condition of the town has for many years been under consideration by the authorities , and various schemes for dealing with the sewage and drainage ? which from time immemorial has ftowed untreated into ? the River Brit ? have been suggested . Suggestions they long remained ; while the crude sewage flowed on through Bridport to the sea , polluting the stream and wasting the food of the soil ; but we are anticipating . As to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sanitary arrangements were so foul that John Fortescue , in his chapter concerning the Army , which will be found in Early Victorian England ( edited by Mr. G. M. Young ) , says it is literally impossible to set down the disgusting details , and I would not like to be thought less sensitive to decency . Indeed , as late as the Crimean War there was little improvement to boast of . Is it not common knowledge that only the labours of Miss Nightingale and of a Sanitary Commission sent to the scene of war saved a British army that had survived Cossacks and cannons , ioo Cleanliness and Godliness the venality of army contractors and the unexampled stupidity of its own officers , but nearly became a victim of plain filth ? Some Evidence of Improvement. ? Dr. Charles Singer , in his Short History of Medicine , nevertheless contends that the standard of health in this country actually improved in the towns during the eighteenth century , and his figures are not easily to be explained except upon this assumption . If that be so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care given to drains , privies and the like than would appear from the records ; for with the rise of new industries and the growing congestion of the cities there must otherwise have been the most hideous results . But the rate of death falls after the year 1730 ( though London reached its highest figure for the century ten years later ) and there are other small signs of sanitary progress . Observations on Water-closets , Chimneys and Bells. ? By the year 1814 the water-closet must at least have been reasonably common , for in this year a certain Mr. John Phair published his Observations on the Principles and Construction of Water Closets , Chimneys and Bell Hanging . A strange medley , indeed ; but Mr. Phair had discovered that the bell-hanger looked after the perpendicular track of the soil pipe of a water-closet to convey his wires to the under-part of the house . He describes water-closets that must surely have been neat and elegant in appearance , however much they neglected the sordid principles of sanitation . For lack of a proper sewerage system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one such this writer tells us , with a privy set over the pit , to be used by the servants of the household . And such was the state of this pit that two workmen ( who had opened the flags and sought to examine the shaft with a naked light ) were met with an explosion of sewer gas which split a Of Periwigs and Perfumed Corruption ioi bucket and stunned them both . Indeed , they narrowly escaped death . Medicine was still neglected at Oxford and Cambridge , described as the conservatories of the ignorance of the inland peasant ; and it was not from these seats of learning that science was to arise in answer to the challenge of disease , but in the new and growing towns , where the dread of plague and pestilence was best known . Already two ancient cities , Hull , in the darkness of the Middle Ages , and Plymouth ( as we have seen ) , had , it is true , procured themselves supplies of pure water from a distance . But the modern town of Liverpool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50,000 persons , possessed but a few poor wells ; and as late as 1844 the Liverpudlians fetched their water in carts to the town , the poor being reduced to beg or steal such water as they used at the risk of savage penalties . Small wonder , then , that the state of this place and of other towns in Lancashire became such a scandal to their inhabitants that from Liverpool and Manchester there began the movement for Sanitary Reform ; and the Manchester Board of Health , as a private association termed itself , became the forerunner of national improvement . Efficacy of Cholera as a Sanitary Inspector. ? Mr. Gilbert Slater ( from whose work on The Growth of Modern England I gleaned some of my knowledge ) remarks that such pioneers as manned the Manchester Board of Health were not numerous , and that even where they were active their efforts were not equal to the struggle ; for industries soon began to grow like mushrooms and industrial towns like toadstools . Typhus thrived in their contaminated water and the condition of the people was but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removal of refuse from the courts , where commonly it was left to stink . Indeed it was not until we were smitten by the cholera ( a dreaded // plague , observes Mr. Slater , but a most helpful and valuable sanitary inspector ) that public attention was forced to the true cause of such scourges . This plague was visited upon us in the years 1831 and 1832 , and among the results may be counted the General Report on the Sanitary ' Condition of the Labouring Classes of Great Britain , by Edwin Chadwick , in 1842 . An Epitome of the Victorian Age. ? Here , then , we will pause , having now taken leave of powder and perfume , and standing upon the very threshold of Reform . Before us ( like some widening road that gathers the straggling lanes of the countryside together , and sweeps their traffic into its growing caravan , hurrying towards the city ) the Great Age of Victoria leads on to unseen doom . And , like prophets wise after the event , here we will apostrophise the rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baths and closets about to appear in the drab houses that are now to be built . You , the future men and women of an era that will dazzle itself with its own splendour , conscious of greatness , like your Elizabethan ancestors , soberly selfsatisfied where they were most bibulously boisterous , yet not without some of their charm ; you who will first hear that cleanliness is next to godliness ; you who will carry Respectability to the cannibal , sending your missionaries forth as prophets of decency and salesmen of Lancashire cotton ; you who will breed slums and socialists , new diseases and modern medicine , whose plumbing will rival that of Rome no less than your rapacity ; what do you know of the nemesis awaiting your descendants , when the science you will bequeath to them has grown to giant stature , and the dark , secret god of force and fraud by whose power you lived has begotten his bastards ? Their Epitaph shall be that they attended to Plumbing . ? They can not hear us ; not because they are dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing of the TerOf // ror by Night and the Thing that is being born in the womb of civilisation . They are proud , and for one thing at least we will share their pride ; they learnt , however slowly , that true greatness does not disdain unsavoury detail . For all their crimes and all their blunders , the greedy policies for which we pay in blood today , let us then praise them for this ; they attended to plumbing . It is the kindliest epitaph on the Victorians and without loss to truth . But before we proceed further with the burial service they shall live again for us in our next chapter . CAPUT VII Of the Struggle for Cleanliness and the Conversion of the Aristocracy Reprehensible Behaviour of Lord Byron. ? My Lord Byron , as I have read , was barred from . Long 's Hotel in Bond Street as a result of a very regrettable incident which would no doubt be thought more to his shame now than it was in his own time . My authority is that young man whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages of For Your Convenience , a work to which I hope to refer again in good time . His explana-tion , as he phrases it , is that on a cold wet night Lord Byron deemed the hall to be a less inclement place than an uncovered yard . That this would not have been considered culpable in many other places or in earlier times my authority considers to be well established in the writings of Ned Ward , Dean Swift , Smollett and Gay . But the ban of the hotel must surely be accepted as evidence of progress ; and as this chapter is largely concerned with the progressive abolition of such Byronic behaviour , I begin thus upon a note of hope . New Water-closets at Windsor. ? Once more a British queen sets an example neglected by so many of our kings . In the reign of Victoria bathrooms are installed at Buck-ingham Palace . As to privies , I have no notion of the fate that befell the flushed closet of Queen Anne at Windsor , 104 // but Albert the Good persuaded his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than commodes ) to allow the introduction of the most modern type of water-closet then known , with a system of drainage , into Windsor Castle . For which alone Albert surely deserved his title , since the persuasion was no easy matter , Victoria being convinced that in such a system the inside of the pipes must become foul . In the previous century it was necessary for Bishop Butler to defend the institution of hospitals against those godly persons who believed that the sick should suffer the Will of God in patience . We . shall expect opposition now to plumbing , and ( as you shall see ) it was not lacking ; hut the plumbing will proceed throughout the Victorian era in spite of every conspiracy to prevent it . Let the name of EDWIN CHADWICK now be remembered , a most worthy gentleman and ( in. his own Victorian fashion ) an apostolic successor of Sir John , carrying into the realm of politics and the administrative battlefield the brave escutcheon of Ajax . This was the man who had such faith in sanitation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of him it was said by Sir William Collins that he looked to a day when doctors would be unable to live , yet perhaps unable to die . Divers Commissions on Filth. ? Yet another of these Great Victorians was Dr. Southwood Smith who , in the first years of the queen 's reign , busied himself in collecting information regarding the sanitary conditions of the metropolis . His findings were published in a report , supplementary to that of the Poor Law Enquiry Commission ( on which he served ) , shewing the filthy , close and crowded state of houses in the quarters of the poor . The hater to arouse the consciences of officials and medical practitioners , Dr. Smith informed them of the poisonous conditions which he found , from the total want of drain106 Cleanliness and Godliness age and the masses of putrefying matter of all sorts which were allowed to remain and accumulate indefinitely , and such ( he said ) are these conditions that during the last year , in several parishes , both relieving officers and medical men lost their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inspired that of Edwin Chadwick , to which we have made reference in the previous chapter . Chadwick was a man so essentially reasonable ( they are to be found in every age ) that his conceptions , accepted as self-evident in a later generation , ensured him the reputation of a fanatic in his own . He was born into an age when corruption was considered so normal that it is perhaps relevant to recall an anecdote with which Sir William Collins illustrates this notorious fact , in a brief monograph on The Life and Doctrine of Sir Edwin Chadwick . A fellow minister having told Lord Melbourne that he had to choose between two candidates for a valuable office , admitted that one of the two was a relative of his own and that , ceteris paribus , he proposed to give the post to his relative . So should I , replied His Lordship , and damn ceteris paribus . Edwin Chadwick and his Sanitary Idea ? He offends The Times and Big Business. ? To such an attitude Chadwick opposed the principle of competitive examination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting all his life against the system of political patronage that clogged the machinery of reform . But above all other things he fought for what he termed The Sanitary Idea , the consciousness among the public and among officials and administrators of the need for cleanliness and for devising the means to achieve it . Among practical achievements he secured the adoption of glazed earthenware drains for domestic and public use , to replace those of stone or brick , and for the manufacture of such drains a factory was established at Lambeth by Henry Doulton in the year 1846 . But // Edwin Chadwick , for the sake of hygiene and cleanliness , made more enemies than any man in his time , which is a good measure of a man 's worth in a corrupt society ; and the more so if we consider that these enemies included The Times and Hudson , the first railway magnate . But this man Chadwick , who was taunted with . despotism and dictatorial behaviour , understood better than all his enemies the catch phrases which they employed in their attempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the power of doing anything that does not hurt another . His Opinion of Politicians. ? The work of Edwin Chadwick was principally concerned with the life of the poor , his object being to establish sanitary conditions in which , as he believed , disease would become impossible . For he observed that the ordinary epidemics occurred in the greatest proportion in common conditions of foul air , from stagnant putrefaction , from bad house drainage , from sewers of deposit , from excrement-sodden sites , from filthy street surfaces , from impure water and from overcrowding in private houses and in public institutions . And as to our statesmen , it was his open opinion that he knew of no investigation which did not reverse almost every main principle on which parliamentary committees and politicians of high position were prepared to base legislation . Sanitation opposed by Commercial Enterprise. ? But even the benches of Westminster were rocked a little by the report of Dr. Southwood Smith , and the Commissioners who had reported on the state of London were instructed to extend their researches throughout England and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the fruit . What Dr. Smith had said of London , Chadwick shewed to be true of the whole country , and he indicted filth as the murderer of more persons than any war of those times . He exposed also the insufficiency and defects in the water supply , and the great need for drainage . zo8 Cleanliness and Godliness That little enough was done at first , and that sufficiently slowly , to meet the demands of Chadwick and the Commissioners , scarcely needs to be said . But a further Commission , and this a Royal one , went yet further into the matter and the General Board of Health was born of its travail . With Chadwick on the Board you may be sure it was not lacking in energy ; but against it was ranged that commercial enterprise ( I use the delicate euphemism of Sir John Simon , who must not be confused with a certain Lord now living ) which sought to preserve private interests . Commercial enterprise included numerous water companies whose supplies to the public the Board condemned as insufficient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his later title of Shaftesbury , was on this Board and must be considered among the early Sani , tarians , the Sanitary Fathers , and as an embodiment of the return of godliness to cleanliness , for he was an advocate of both . Which conspires successfully against Chadwick. ? Appointed but for five years , a poor probationer , the Board in its zeal for cleanliness landed itself , rather than others , in hot water . To confuse the metaphor , we might add that the Government was but lukewarm in its support . Lord John Russell had become Prime Minister , and appears to have held that all human progress ended in the Reform Act of 1832 . Himself the reputed inventor of a mahogany bath ( it was seven feet by four , lined with sheet lead , and weighed near a ton ? Victorian in every detail ) , Lord John was , however , no Knight of the Bath , ready to risk a fall for cleanliness ' sake . He took the view that Chadwick had not observed the most conciliatory tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legitimate interests of many very intelligent and very active men . Or , in plainer language , that Chadwick had no time for sharks ; for which reason he was retired on a pension . The Board // itself was with difficulty and a little subterfuge preserved from extinction at the hands of the Parliamentary representatives of Commercial Enterprise . As to technical progress , during the nineteenth century many improved valve closets were devised , notably those of Stevens Hellyer and Henry Doulton , these being followed in the course of evolution by the wash-out , washdown and syphonic types . But use did not keep pace with invention ; for just as a new machine of war , once it is invented , will be quickly imitated and copied in great quant ities , so a mere device for cleanliness and health is held in contempt among us and the inventor may count upon neglect as the reward of his pains . Then with regard to drains , these long continued to be made of stone or porous brick , while many were open sewers when Chadwick and Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartments at Buckingham Palace were ventilated . Of Victorian Baths. ? In the matter of baths there was , for a while , almost as little improvement to speak of . The Victorians commonly used the hip bath ( when they used any at all ) which was of iron and enamelled . And this they filled with cans of heated water from their basement kitchens ; from which I conjecture that ( except for those whose wealth could employ servants for the carrying ) cleanliness was next to impossible , as the saying is . Nevertheless one Victorian inventor made a bath of cast iron with gas burners beneath it , so that one sat in it like a pudding in the pot , in peril of being boiled alive . But if there remained many who lacked the means of cleanliness , they were not utterly forgotten , as witness the considerate provision , by the Duke of Argyll , of posts with nails in them , for the use of private soldiers of the British Army in India . From which it became the custom of these men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these posts , God bless the Duke of Argyll . // Of Human Inertia. ? And so , while scientific knowledge strode forward to an unknown destiny of destructive perfection , social evolution lagged and limped , the poor relation of Victorian Progress . Medicine , it is true , had at last emerged from centuries of superstition , from the doves ' dung and powdered shoes of the Babylonians , from the skinned mice of the Egyptian papyri , from the dung beetles of the Byzantines and the horrid remedies in use against the Plague . The London Pharmacopoeia no longer prescribed the sexual organs and excreta of animals , human perspiration or the saliva of a fasting man , as Dr. Fielding Garrison tells us concerning the seventeenthcentury edition of this work , in his History of Medicine . But while medicine now follows the path of scientific experiment and discovery there is no Imhotep , no Moses or Mohamet to write the new Commandments in the language of authority . The Prophet of Israel had his miracles and the Prophet of Islam his sword , but the prophets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slow miracles that are shewn in graphs and statistics , after years of infinite patience , to justify their inconspicuous labours . A most fortunate Stink at the Westminster Gas Works . ? Consider next the water supply . Though much was done to amend it , Sir John Simon could write in his book English Sanitary Institutions , as late as the year 1889 , that even the London water supply , after half a century of disgusting disclosures , and after various very terrible disasters , was not yet secured against gross defilement ; a fact which he said was proved by official reports and was in other ways deplorably notorious . For my part I do not doubt that there would have been little improvement or none at all , had not our legislators suffered upon occasion the consequences of their own criminal apathy . For in the year 1855 Sir Benjamin Hall ( immortalised in Big Ben Of the Struggle for Cleanliness III among a generation that no longer remembers the origin of this name ) found a certain measure designed for the health of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Parliament . But the condition of the Thames in the summer of that year became so foul that it was impossible to use the committee rooms upon the river side of the House , in consequence of which the opposition was withdrawn and the sanitarians were permitted to have their way , since it was pointed out that only by the necessary powers being granted : could the matter be dealt with and these committee rooms rendered habitable once more . 0 for a magic carpet of infinite dimensions that could transport all the leaking drains and condemned closets from all the slums of the Empire and heap them in Downing Street in such another object lesson to our rulers and governors ! But do not imagine that indifference or stupidity began or ended in these quarters . Proud of his conservatism and even of his dull wits , the Englishman has chosen as his national emblem the gross and repulsive figure of John Bull , not uncommonly accompanied by his Bull-dog , a scowling , ferocious , snuffling , growling , insensitive and ugly creature , which only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true picture of itself . Let us admit the fact with a proper humility and cease to boast of it as a national accomplishment ; we have . the thickest pates in Europe . And when it was a question of purifying our potable water do you not suppose that our grandfathers argued that it had been good enough for their grandfathers ? Or that the old woman in the Fens spoke for many besides herself when she asked of the new and pure supply : Call ye that water ? For she said , it has neither taste nor smell . Lord Shaftesbury describes the Enemies of Sanitation . ? The indifference of authority towards the health of the // nation did not fail to arouse the indignation of those who had appointed themselves keepers of the national conscience in sanitary affairs . In the diary of Lord Shaftesbury there are many references to the opposition of the whole tribe of jobbers who live on the miseries of mankind , as he described the opponents of reform . He was sick , he wrote , to see how little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn that not only nothing is done by the Government , but that the ministers will take good care that nothing shall be done by anyone else . And of the intention to destroy the Board of Health he wrote that its sin was its unpardonable activity . Also he enumerates the enemies of the Board : the College of Physicians , because they had maintained and proved that many a Poor Law medical officer knew more than all the flash and fashionable doctors of London ; the Boards of Guardians , whose selfishness and cruelty had been exposed ; the Treasury , whose subalterns hated Edwin Chadwick ; and the Commissioners of Sewers , who hated the Board with a perfect hatred because it had plans which were the contrary to their own . Cholera alone brought improvement , where reason and justice had failed ; and the appointment of that Dr. Simon to whom we have already referred ( for he was later knighted ) to be medical adviser to the Privy Council , was the manner in which the Government admitted a tardy conversion to the principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Employment .  - -  Lest it should be imagined that the arguments with which ( in other matters ) we are familiar are in any way new , we may observe that Edwin Chadwick recorded the views of certain parish officers opposed to his proposals for improvement in these words . He said that they considered it expedient to keep the streets in their present state of filth in order to keep up the means of employing indigent persons as street sweepers and sweepers of crossings in re-s // moving it . And those who have experienced the cogency of such arguments will best appreciate the opposition to Edwin Chadwick , the neglect and rancour from which he suffered for the great part of his life , also the reason why the honour of knighthood did not overtake him until he was within a year of his death , at the age of ninety . Conversion of the Quarterly Review. ? Dr. Simon , who wore the mantle of Chadwick with a greater public success , reaping where Chadwick had sown , first distinguished himself as Medical Officer of Health for the City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City of London for the years 1848 to 1849 is among the historic documents to be considered in our study . For this report so moved the Olympian editor of the Quarterly Review t hat in September of 185o its pages were for the most part devoted to matters of health and sanitation , to the denunc iation of private monopolies in the supply of water and.of impurity in that supply , to the dearness of water , the lack of it in the poorer quarters , the combination of private interests against the public . And of the Thames they said in this journal that it was still foul with guano , stable dung , rotten sprats and the discharge of all the London sewers . New forces of publicity began , indeed , to be enlisted in the cause of cleanliness about this time ; and we may trace our slow progress from the growth of a group of writers prepared to break a quill upon the matter . One such , in a later number of the Quarterly Review , in these words cast igates the corruption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citadel of filth has stood a ten years ' siege ; and its st urdy garrison , led by their chieftains in Common Couni the Hectors and Memnons of intramural muck , so far from thinking of surrender are engaged at this moment in fortifying their defences . But the Defenders of Filth , says t h is writer , have ruled London long enough . // Great Antiquity and Respectability of Vested Interests in Dirt. ? Dr. Stella Churchill , in her account of Health Services and the Public , has a whole chapter on the private interests that have throughout our history opposed themselves to public health . For even as early as 1343 there was an attempt on the part of the persons living in the streets which led down to the Thames to close these streets and exact a toll from all who fetched water from the river . But the point needs not to be laboured ; for it is surely understood that in this matter as in all things , where a reform is proposed in the public interest , men will divide for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the reform because they fear to lose money by it , and those who ( like Drake in the matter of the Plymouth Water Supply ) support it because they hope to profit thereby . Was not our patron saint , St. George of Cappadocia , a profiteer ? Of Paris under the Second Empire. ? It must not be thought that the picture we have provided of English nastiness was less true of the continent of Europe . Indeed there is little doubt that in the past century , because our industries were more advanced , our towns more congested , our need for this cause being the greater , more progress was made in Britain ( under the threat of loathsome diseases ) than in other countries of Europe . Hence we find that the worst squalor was accompanied by the most vigorous efforts at reform , which , making some slow progress against the phalanx of vested interest in dirt , placed England unwillingly in the very van of the sanitary offensive . It is even recorded of Chadwick that , being asked by the lesser Napoleon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words : Sire , they say that Augustus found Rome a city of brick and left it a city of marble . If your Majesty , finding Paris fair above , will leave it sweet below , you will more than rival the first Emperor of Rome . // But others have it that his reply was more epigrammatic , and that he described Paris under the Second Empire as /air above , Sire , and foul below . The true Story of Minnehaha. ? As to Germany , the progress of that country in the present century need not be permitted to conceal the fact that in the last the Germans were as dirty as any , though the story that Goethe bathed but once in twelve months has been discredited . Even in the United States of America , that land of progress and promise , the use of water-closets spread very slowly , for we read that among the first to install such a system was the poet Longfellow , in the year 1840 . We may well suppose that some such project was in his mind when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some thought of it must have inspired that line in The Goblet of life , where he says The prayer of Ajax was for light . Mr. Stanley Walker writes , in his book Mrs. Astor 's Horse , that the instalment of this water-closet in the house of I lenry Wadsworth gave ' a tremendous impetus to the new scheme ; but thirty years later , he says , a distinguished American died a victim of a closet that was not properly drained , which was still considered by some the act of an inscrutable and mysterious Providence . As to baths , I believe Benjamin Franklin sponsored the tub in America in &)out; 1770 , and bathing spread slowly enough . Discovery that Sanitation pays Dividends. ? The labours n ( such philanthropists as Chadwick were not ( as we have talrcady hinted ) without support from others whose eni1 htenment originated in different considerations . Thus Captain Douglas Galton , in a speech from the Chair at a Conference on Sanitary Subjects ( on the occasion of the International Health Exhibition in June of 1884 ) , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm i16 Cleanliness and Godliness labourer was as much an appendage of the farm as a stable ; that good stables were built for horses , and if the land were to be cultivated in a proper manner good houses ought to be built for labourers , so that they might be healthy and be able to do their work properly . And even in cities , he said , he was not sure that it would not be desirable for manufacturers to build houses for their workmen , as had been done at Mulhouse , and in various parts of the Continent , where the workman was made almost an integral part of the factory . Nematoid Worms in the Lord Mayor 's Drinking Water . ? Moreover , once the initial stupidity and conservatism of the upper classes had been sufficiently disturbed by disease , a dread arose among them that diseases engendered among their helots might spread to themselves , or as Arnold Sorsby has it in Medicine and Mankind , Dives feared for himself rather than felt for Lazarus . Also in such matters as the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my lord 's health could only be pursued through attention to public interest in the proper supervision of a pure supply to the generality . This must have been tolerably plain to that Lord Mayor of whom Mr. Lewis Angel spoke at a Conference on the Promotion of Social Science ( in London , an . 1884 ) . For he said that it was not long since there was found , in the cisterns . at the Mansion House , three-quarters of an inch of fung ' scrub floating on the surface and three-eighths of an inch of mud at the bottom , while a bottle of water on his lordship 's table was found to contain nematoid worms by the hundred . And such things he said also of the Athenaeum Club , enough to put the fear of God even into a bishop . A Bishop also among the Prophets. ? This makes relevant the contribution of religion to the general problem of health at this time . We have referred in previous chapters of this book to an attitude , not unknown in the nineteenth // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the will of God , deemed all efforts to abolish the sources f infection to be a form of impiety . Such an attitude was ess common among the clergy than that of indifference , he spiritual leaders of the people waiting ( like the Golden Calf ) to be dragged forward by their followers . Neverthcless a few honourable names among the religious leaders of the nineteenth century may be mentioned as those of eminent sanitarians ; and of these the evangelical Earl of Shaftesbury and that lusty Protestant , Charles KingsIcy , deserve first consideration . Dr. Blomfield ( as Bishop of London ) , under the inspiration of Chadwick , played a leading part in the House of Lords , where he put on the whole armour of the faith in defence of the principles of odily health . The Radicals were , upon the whole , sup ? orters of sanitary reform ; and from this we may assume a ood body of Dissenters to have been in the ranks . But I to as yet uncertain whether to include with these Mr. purgeon 's housemaid ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shew with what works she proved her aith , replied that , whereas she had formerly swept all dust Under the mats of hearthrugs , she now removed it entirely ( tom the rooms . Indifference of the Learned. ? Support was often least available where most might have been hoped for , among the learned , whose studies , as in the Middle Ages , did Ilttle to profit humanity . Of an earlier century there is the familiar story that Samuel Johnson met a lady 's accusation ( it was true enough ) that he smelt by observing You smell , 1 , link . The Doctor was concerned with the correct use of language but unmoved by the imputation of bodily dirtin ; s . In the century of which we now speak the universities of Oxford and Cambridge maintained the same academic I t achment and remained mediaeval to the last insanitary ( I tail , Minerva sitting upon a cesspool . And of a famous // college at Cambridge it is recorded that the Master exercised his veto to prevent the construction of baths for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us only for eight weeks at a time . That the great industrial towns which were forced by the circumstances into the vanguard were not , however , always aware of their responsibilities is shewn in a tale concerning Lord Palmerston and the city of Glasgow , which will be found in The Preparation of Peace , by Mr. Laurence Housman . Some eighty or ninety years ago ( writes Mr. Housman ) terrible epidemic visited the city of Glasgow . And the cit fathers of Glasgow invited the Prime Minister to ordain , b Order in Council , a day of national humiliation and prayer so that the plague might be stayed . Lord Palmerston ver sensibly replied that if they would practise humility home by looking to their drains , it would be very muc better and more effective than imposing humiliation upo others . Of this excellent advice , Mr. Housman says that h has no doubt that a great many pious people were shocke by it ; and he considers ( this present blood-bath notwit standing ) that we are today a more godly people than th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uncovenanted mercies of God , t take the place of sanitation . Virtues and Vices of the Victorians. ? Well , Mr. Hou man calls himself a Victorian and has a better right than have to be harsh at their expense . But for my part I am i clined to thank them for such sanitation as we have ; f if they moved but slowly and were a stiff-necked gener tion , nevertheless they moved , and whatever water-closet drains , baths and other civilised amenities of this kind enjoy today , I suppose we owe them something for thes things . And if ever I curse them it will not be for their shortcomings in plumbing but for their most vaunte // achievements , for a growing prosperity and a deceptive peace that had their roots in land-grabbing and moneypower , in coveting their neighbour 's vineyard and seizing it by ruses worthy of old Ahab . And I will dare to say that if they had plumbed their own souls and the national diplomacy but half as well as they plumbed their cities , we might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cholera to arouse them to the need for good drainage , so it may be that only war will bring us to our right senses in certain other matters . Where , then , are the Chadwicks and Shaftesburys of today , the prophets of Social Sanitation and Spiritual Regeneration ? For if they are lacking , or being present should speak to deaf ears , ours is a worse crime than that of the Victorians , whom God spared as he did the people of Nineveh , whose sons they so nearly resembled . The Vastness of their Undertaking. ? The labour of creating sanitation , when it was undertaken in earnest , proved to be both vast and formidable . It was not enough to build new houses with a proper sanitary complement , and to provide a water supply adequate in quantity and quality , with an effective system of drainage . Old houses needed to be adapted to the same pattern and hidden sources of corruption lurked like evil spirits in the very bowels of the earth . For a speaker at the Conference on the Promotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person bought , or hired , or inherited or altered a house , he should first of all look for forgotten and hidden cesspools . And speaking of his own experience , he said the number of these forgotten cesses was inconceivable , and that the mischief they were doing was immeasurable . Also he said that there were no more treacherous buildings than those of the generation before his own , when mechanical science had attained a high perfection and chemical investigation had not advanced equally .
