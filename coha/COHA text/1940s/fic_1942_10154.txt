he said , " to know that General Shelby is apprised of  --  every-thing . " " And I assure you it is no affair of mine , " Clay replied shortly . But as he walked to join the other officers , his mind was ridden by a new , bitter suspicion . The Quantrill connection made more plausible than ever the suspicion of a twisted designon the part of Parridine . And what did that mean for Merit Hampton ? Clay was forced to remember that women of beauty and innocent appearance had before this acted as spies , some of them very devious and dangerous . In some manner women can cloak the darkest thoughts behind brows as clear as the morning . Assuredly Shelby 's adventure was within the realms of international affairs , its implications great and far-reaching . Suddenly Clay remembered Merit 's silence concerning her reasons for going to Mexico . She had been willing to use him as a guide and escort  --  but she told him nothing . Over him came a chilling bewilderment  --  it was as if something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He squared his shoulders . Matters now clouded would presentlymake themselves plain ; in the meantime Clay began to realize that he had been in danger of allowing emotions naturalin a young man , yet to be guarded against in a soldier , to blind him . Perhaps already things had occurred which he should have seen , and which he had failed to see , his vision being dimmed . There came a prickle of anger in his spine , and it was anger directed at himself . . . . Horses were being brought and the noise and confusion of many riders mounting filled the night about him . An orderly put his bridle in his hand . Mechanically he swung into his saddle . Parridine was gone already , and Clay found himself riding with Colonel Slayback and Colonel Collins of the artillery . Those veteran officers attempted at first to jest with him aboutp201his recent adventures , but finding him inattentive they ' desisted , and fell into a conversation between themselves on lancer tactics , which had been discarded by the Confederate cavalry since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still kept in vogue . Presently they dismounted before a low , wide-spreading adobe structure , the windows of which were gay with lights . Servants took their horses and Senor Anda himself greeted them in the inner patio . Governor Biesca already was on hand , a portly , greasy man , with an opaque black mustache falling down at the sides of his mouth , and a furtive , gleaming smile that he turned off and on at will , like a light . Biesca 's staff was present also  --  in scarlets , and blues , and golds , somewhat soiled and ragged as to uniform , but ornate with decorations , and reeking with cheap perfumes . Compared with them , the ragged officers of Shelby 's staff looked like beggars ; but for all their gaudy uniforms the men of Biesca 's entourage were notably deferential to the tall , fierce-eyed Americano soldiers . Their host , Senor Anda , interested Clay most . Here , there , everywhere he was . In the whole company only he and Biesca understood both English and Spanish  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So the fat little alcalde did the honors for the less distinguished officers . In and out among them he waddled almost at a run , interpreting for as many as three conversations at once , his big buck teeth gleaming cordiality , his small black mustache quivering with excitement  --  host , entertainer , and servant to his guests at one and the same time . Presently the visitors were summoned to the feast , where the Missourians sampled strange , hotly seasoned dishes . At the head of the long table sat Senor Anda , with Shelby on one side and Biesca at the other ; and the alcalde kept the Confederate general 's glass always full of aguardiente , or tequila , or wine , matching him drink for drink , so that by the end of the meal the plump little host was weaving in his seat , although to the end he maintained a devotion nothing less than heroic to his duties and to his guests . Afterward the tables were cleared for monte and roulette , and the dealers took their places . Shelby 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they possessed . It was at this time that Clay suddenly thought to look around for Parridine . The man was not to be seen . Clay considered this for a moment , then without asking any questions , he began a slow tour through the house and patio . In one room he came upon Shelby , Biesca , and Anda , sitting at a table , their heads close together , bottles thick on the floor . The Missourian 's spine , Clay observed , was still erect and unbending , for which he was famous ; but the two Mexicans swayed together , their eyelids heavy and their tongues thick . Parridine was not there . He was not in the alcalde 's house  --  anywhere in it . Clay found his hat and stepped out into the night . His head sang from much tequila , but not enough to dim his thought . Parridine was gone . To Clay that meant one thing . . . Merit . He was determined to follow . Yet even as he reached this determination he confessed to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found them together . The action would depend on the event , he told himself . His legs seemed too long for him and the ground had strange inequalities . Surely he had not drunk so much tequila as to dizzy himself like this . He called for his horse , and a servant had to hold the animal while Clay pulled himself awkwardlyup into the saddle . He said to himself , Clay Bennett , you 're drunk . You 've got to get hold of yourself . You hadp203better go to your tent and not try to nose into something that is no part of your business . But his horse carried him along , down to the ferry landing . And there he saw the ugly , awkward lines of the ferry boat , tied up at the shore just where it had been when he saw it last , with the little ferryman asleep on the deck in the stern . The ferry had not moved that evening , Clay felt sure . He turned toward the camp . A sentinel challenged , then came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row of officers ' tents . Clay turned his horse over to an orderly and stumbled down officers ' row , seeing no sign of the man he sought . His mind , however , was beginning to clear somewhat . Parridineevidently was not in camp . There was one other place he could be . The village . Unsteady still , Clay walked back toward Piedras Negras . A hulking figure crossed his path . " Cap'n Bennett ? " " Yes . " " It 's Janeicke , seh . " " Well , what do you want ? " " I heard ye was back , seh , an ' I want to ask ye somep'n . If ye do n't mind tellin ' , what 's this yarn about Shelby diddlin ' us out of a heap of money , an ' then throwin ' us in with them greaser rebels ? " " Who 've you been talking to ? " Gonder was bivouacking with this man , and Clay remembered that Gonder knew the story of Shelby 's rejection of Governor Murrah 's treasury offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the story 's all ovah camp , seh , " Janeicke told him . " Spreadin ' like a prairie fire . The boys is pretty confused , an ' it do n't set so good with them . I told some of ' em that story about the money was pure crazy . Shelby would n't do nawthin '  | like that to us . An ' then who but Gid Gonder should tell me I was wrong  --  that the gen'ral did jest that ! " " Was it Gonder put out that story in camp ? " " No , seh . He jest talked about it to me , an ' nobuddy else . He said that part of it he knowed was true , but the other part , about the rebels , he did n't know nawthin ' about . If it is true , seh , the boys 'll be almighty het up . We 're supposed to have a vote , ye know . Gen'ral or no gen'ral , Ole Jo 's got to consult with the Brigade , befo ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t' other . The story 's havin ' a mean effect . Who wants to fight for these hyar filthy greasers ? Not me ! Rev'lution ? Hell , they 're jest a set of bandits  --  every one of ' em afteh the main chance fo ' hisself . I 've heard the men talkin ' , seh . Ye kin see that some of ' em 's pretty hot onder the collar . If it was white men , it 'd be diff'rent . But these Juaristas is jest a bunch of saddle-colored Mexicanos . Most everybuddy I 've talked to says if we fight , let 's fight along with the whites  --  an ' the whites in this war is all with that thar emp'ror , Maximilian . But the wussest part  --  if it 's true  --  is we ai n't been consulted . That was the agreement  --  we was to have a yote . I wish ye 'd try to get to Major Edwards , or mebbe Ole Jo hisself , an ' tell ' em how the boys is feelin ' . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his news was rapidly completing the clearing of Clay 's head . " Listen to me , Janeicke , " he said , " you 're not going back on General Shelby , are you ? " " I 'd cut the gizzard out of the polecat that said I was ! " " Then keep your eyes open , and stop as much of this gossip in camp as you can . Tell them it 's latrine rumor  --  not substantiated  --  anything to check it . I think there 's something stinkingand treacherous being hatched in this camp . Where 's Gon-der ? " " He went off to town . They was givin ' passes to sech of thep205boys as wanted ' em , sort of a general jollification , since the officersis all celebratin ' at Senor Anda 's . Gonder took one an ' said he was goin ' off to commit vice . " Clay left the mountaineer , and began walking rapidly toward the main plaza of Piedras Negras . The town 's central street was lined on either side by low mud buildings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few of the tiendas , and all the cantinas , with their colored paper decorations over the doors , were brightly lighted . The street seemed full of Shelby 's soldiers . For two days they had watched the women of Piedras Negras come and go , swinging their hips past the camp entrance , casting glances and smiles of enticement over their shoulders . Now they had come to find out what was to be made of those glances . Here and there ragged troopers slipped furtively through dark alleys which stank of urine and garbage , on the prowl , eyes alert for lighted windows . Bursts of loud laughter issued from drinking places , and American oaths . In shadowy doorways lurked Mexican men , frightened , raging , dangerous . The darkness behind the buildings was alive with whispers , the tittering of women , and hurrying feet . Clay halted on a well-lighted corner , wondering where to turn , when a hyena 's laugh resounded close , and a huge figure came down the street , each arm clasped around the waist of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light from an open doorway gleamed on a bushy red beard . " Gonder ! " he shouted . Instantly the big man flung the two women away from him and started across toward Clay . There was a wail from the deserted girls , a frustrated and disappointed wail , but it changed almost instantly to squeals and shrieks of half-frighteneddelight , as a passing group of roistering soldiers bore them off . No woman half good-looking and half-willing need fear neglect on this night.  | " What you doin ' here , seh ? " exclaimed Gonder . " I thought you was at Anda 's  --  " " What do you know about this story going around concerning the general ? " " You mean the money ? It was n't me started it . I got my notions , though . " " And the deal with the Revolutionists . Have you heard that one ? " " Yes , seh . An ' I think both come from the same source . Parridine . " " Parridine ? " This agreed with Clay 's suspicions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty thick with them stragglersfrom the Irreg'lar Texas Cavalry . Well , it 's them white trashes that 's been the busiest circ'lating them stories . Parridinemay not have put them up to it , but he 's my candidate on the ev'dence now befo ' us . " " Have you seen Parridine ? " " A few minutes ago , he was in the place called El Dorado . A combination drinkin ' an ' gamin ' house . He was playin ' cyards " " Gambling ? Odd . He left the alcalde 's where everybody was doing that very thing . " " Mebbe he figgered the pickin 's would be easier here . Parridinenever gambles jest fo ' pleasure . " " But an officer , riffling enlisted men  --  ? " Clay was disgusted . " You fo'get , seh , that he ai n't no longer a officer . He 's a private citizen  --  like you . It 's within his rights to set in with anybody he wants . Besides , mebbe , he 's playin ' fo ' more than money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where 's this El Dorado ? " he asked . " I 'll show you . " Two blocks down the street an open door poured forth brightp207light and an overpowering stench of sour pulque . Gonder halted before it and glanced at Clay . They entered together . It was a typical Mexican drinking room , somewhat larger than the ordinary pulque shop . Along the back wall stood the bar , and before the bar was ranged a solid line of gray uniforms . The walls , illumined by many candles , displayed strange waterpaintdesigns stenciled upon them  --  dolphins , volcanoes , and boats , all done in gilt on a background of faded blue . High shelves were covered with rows of crockery plates , jugs , and mugs , which had nothing to do with the dispensing of drinks , being for ornament only . At the end of the room farthest from the door by which the two had entered , stood several tables covered with green baize ; and at one of these , with half a dozen tipsy soldiers , sat Parridine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuffling a pack of cards . Other tables had their groups , the clink of coins sounded a metallic undertone to the conversation . At the end of the wet bar , where it curved to the wall , Clay and Gonder slipped into a vacancy . They ordered tequila . Thus far Parridine apparently had not noticed them . A voice lifted sharply , and necks craned . At the guerrilla 's table a young trooper had leaped to his feet and Parridine was regarding him from beneath level black brows . " Raised out ? " he said . Not noisily , but so clearly that in the hush which had fallen , the words were clearly audible . " Christ a'mighty ! " said the youth , swaying on his feet . He did not speak angrily , but in a strained voice . " I hai n't got a cent left . " " That 's nothing to feel bad about , son . Nobody in this Brigadeis any better off . Here  --  split the pot . " Parridine shoved some coins across the table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke , " he went on , as if talking only to his immediate companions , though his words carried to every ear in the cantina . " Because every man in this outfit ought to have plenty of the ready . Right at this very minute . Know that ? You 'd all have three hundred dollars gold in your pockets now  --  every man here  --  if you had your just rights ! " He put indescribable emphasis in the last words . " What d' you mean ? " The voice came from one of the other tables , and it was as if the speaker 's throat had grown suddenlydry . " Just this : The governor of Texas offered three hundred thousand dollars in gold to this Brigade  --  to be divided equally among the men . " Parridine faced the room , now frankly speaking to all . " An ' whut happened to it ? " demanded the same questioner . " What happened ? Why , Shelby refused it ! That 's what happened . It was at Austin . Do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Amazement filled the room with murmurs . Another voice spoke : " Wait a minute ! Keerful what ye say about Jo Shelby . He ai n't axed us yet , but ontil he does n't we ai n't hearin ' him blackguarded ! " Parridine 's face did not change , but it was evident he had not counted on this sort of interruption . He made the best of the situation , however . " Good ! " he said . " Forget it . Of course you can prove it for yourselves . " " How ? " " How ? " Half a dozen voices clamored the question . Parridine was in for it now . His only chance was to win these men over completely , and he became more open . " Why not ask Shelby ? " he asked smoothly . " I 'll give you the facts  --  you verify them from his own lips . Remember the money in the treasury at Austin  --  the cash the bushwhackersp209tried to get ? That was Confederate government money . I helped save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . GovernorMurrah , the morning after the raid , implored Shelby to take that money and divide it among all of you  --  said it was the government 's chance to partly repay the arrears it owed you . Boys , you were entitled to that money ! You earned it . But what did Shelby do ? He rejected it . Why ? That 's something he has n't explained . Maybe it was not to his interests for you to have that much cash in your pockets . Maybe he was afraid that with it you might lose interest in his adventure down here in Mexico  --  you might want to go home and begin life over again instead of following him . You know it 's to Shelby 's interest to keep you in the ranks . If I were you , I believe I 'd try finding out ! " This time it was a growl that arose in the room  --  a surly , threatening note , from men just beginning to understand that they had been deprived of what to them was riches . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you about it , " Parridine continued , with a short laugh . " Now perhaps you 'll be interested in something fully as important . What would you boys say if I told you that you 're not headed for Mexico City at all ? " " What do ye mean , Parridine ? " " This : If you 've been whetting your appetite for seeing the capital , get over it . You 're staying right here on the Rio Grande  --  and you 're going to keep on wearing rags , and fighting for the greasers against white men . Have you been consulted about that ? " He threw into their faces his sneering challenge . " That 's bad talk , friend , " drawled a new voice from the bar . " Better be ready to back it up . " It was the second interruption on which Parridine had not counted . But he spoke quickly and very earnestly , realizing that if he did not succeed in what he was attempting , he might be in a serious position . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'll tell you the whole plan  --  because in spite of Shelby , you 're entitled to know it . You 're not going to Mexico City because Jo Shelby 's been using you to buy a fat job for himself  --  the governorship of a province , or some such office . The agreement is already made with Juarez . You 'll hear about it  --  maybe tomorrow . " " How in bloody hell do you know all this ? " demanded the last questioner . Clay saw the man 's face now . Sandy beard , white eyebrows  --  it was Sergeant Hendy Tobias , and Clay knew he was stanch . " Never mind now , " Parridine answered hurriedly . " I 'm telling you about it for one reason only . You 're free to do what you want , are n't you ? You 've an agreement with Shelby I 'm told  --  you can vote on who you 're going to fight for or against . Well , I counsel you to demand a vote on this matter ! Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coin to be had , and the pleasant living ? At the capital ! Out here on the desert all you 'll get is sandstorms , cactus , and death ! Joining the emperor 's side is your only chance to get something for yourselves . You 've got to decide whether you want to fight for beggarly rebels who have n't a chance to win , or a rich government that can and will reward you . Think it over ! If I have n't told the truth , I 'll answer tomorrow . And if I have told the truth  --  just remember who warned you ! " Clay gasped . There was a colossal assumption behind the last sentence . Had he heard aright , or was Parridine actually making a bid for the leadership of the Brigade , or part of it at least  --  providing the Brigade threw Shelby out ? This was treachery of the basest . Treason  --  except there was now no country to give authority . At the very least , Parridine 's arrogantambition meant incitement to mutiny , the overthrow ofp211the loyal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Speechless with the effrontery of it , Clay watched Parridine push himself up from his chair . The man 's glance swept around the room ; there were more than thirty soldiers in it  --  enough for the leaven he wished to introduce  --  and on those thirty faces were doubt and anger . He gathered up his money from the table and walked out of the cantina . Instantly angry voices rose . " I did n't come all the way from Arkansaw to fight no war fo ' lazy greasers ! " Clay recognized that speaker  --  he was the sunken-chested Rufe Champion , of the Texas " Irregulars . " Obviouslyhe had been planted here , and knew his cue . " It 's our own folks , not Mexicans , we got to think about ! " agreed one of Shelby 's troopers . " I do n't take no stock in that fellow 's rema'ks , " objected another . " Why , he 's makin ' a skunk out of Ole Jo ! " " Take it easy ! We kin mighty quick find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk fast ! " " But what if he ai n't lyin ' ? Parridine 's speakin ' cold sense , looks like to me . There 's mo ' in this than ye kin see on the surface . Parridine 's got the right notions . Mebbe this Brigade could stand a change in commanders  --  " Jerking his head at his companion , Clay slipped out of the room to the street , as the debate raged within . Gonder was fuming . " That rattlesnake ! " he snorted . " You goin ' to repawt this matter , seh ? " " As soon as I can get back to camp , " Clay answered . From the shadow of the alley at their elbows stepped a lean and deadly figure . " I saw you , my friends , in that cantina , " said Parridine . " And so , Bennett , you 've added spying to your other accom/I2 plishments . Well , just take this into account  --  I told those men the truth ! " " The truth ? " Clay exclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to give them Shelby 's motives ? You heard Gonder , here , tell that story at the same time I did . Parridine , a halftruth'sa lie ! " " Strange words from a sneak and an eavesdropper  --  " Blinded by fury , Clay swung at the sneering mouth . Backwardstaggered Parridine against the wall , groping savagely for a weapon , and Clay crouched forward waiting . But the guerrilla was unarmed . Suddenly he pulled himself erect and spoke in a voice hushed by passion : " It will amuse me to kill you for that . " And walked away into the night.  |p213HIS  knuckles still tingling , Clay stood outside the cantina listening to the violent argument within . " Gonder , " he said presently , " you saw what happened . " " I did , seh , " Gonder nodded , his eyes glittering . " Parridine  --  he 's murder with a pistol . Deadest shot in the army with a Colt . He 'll ask fo ' Navy revolvers without doubt . If you ai n't made your will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p'ison with the short gun . " Clay 's memory vividly supported this judgment . . . the wet black night in front of the treasury building at Austin , the rush of free-booters to the door , and the deadly staccato of Parridine 's revolvers . But Gander 's attitude nettled him . " I 'll take care of my own end , " he growled . " Sorry , seh , " Gonder was instantly contrite . " I had no intention of injurin ' your feelin 's . The facts of the case jest overwhelmedme . " " I tell you , there 'll be two sides to the argument if Parridinecalls me out , " insisted Clay with irritation . " Sure , seh . Sure . " Gonder spoke as one who reassures , when all experience is in the opposite direction . Clay gave it up . " Let it go  --  it does n't bother me . Gonder ,  |p2I4  we 've been through plenty together . Do me a favor . Represent me in this matter . " Afterward he was to ponder the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most intimate of services , to a man who , a short time before , had been regarded by him as a renegade . " Me ? " exclaimed the astonished Gonder . " Why  --  why  --  I 'm greatly honored , seh . But I 'm no officer  --  " " I regard you as a gentleman . " " Why , thank you . " The big man flushed with pleasure . " I deem it a priv'lege to stand up fo ' you . If that 's the way it 's going to be , let 's look at this thing jest a minute . I told you I knew Parridine  --  river gambler befo ' the war . That 's a thing to bear in mind an ' figger on . When the steamboat traffic went to hell , he jined Quantrill in ' 63 . " " I know about Quantrill . " " I was living at Fairwood at the time , " Gonder continued . " Employed by Jedge Hampton . In jail once  --  trumped-up cha'ges in connection with them mule-buyin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that 's one reason I 'm bound to do my best fo ' Miss Merit . Well , most Quantrill men was known , an ' Parridine was one of ' em . A natural gambler , as I said . He 'd take any chance . That 's what made him a big man with Quantrill  --  he took chances an ' gen'rally won . He 'll bet on anything , an ' a odd bet is a weakness with him . I 've seen him , ridin ' along behind a team , bet which hoss will void fust . Or anything like that . A bad actor an ' shifty an ' dangerous to boot . " " Regardless of that I 've got him to meet , " Clay remarked grimly . " That was n't what I was gettin ' at , seh . I was only linin ' up our man , an ' figgerin ' the best campaign . Say ! " Gonder looked as if sudden inspiration had struck him . " Leave this to me an ' Janeicke . No reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p215We  'll have Parridine bushwhacked befo ' mawnin '  --  befo ' he has a chance to challenge you  --  in a nice , quiet way , so nobody 'll ever know what happened to him . It would be a real pleasure to Esau an ' me . Let us take this off your hands . " Clay shook his head . Gonder considered profoundly . " Why not the Missouri duel ? " he suggested presently . " What 's that ? " " It elim'nates the pistols . Neatest thing you ever seen . Janeicke told me about it . Principals is armed with bowie knives  --  eight-inch blades . Hold a bandanna handkerchief in their teeth , each clampin ' down on a opp'site corner . That puts their eyes eighteen inches apa't . At the signal they goes to work . Fust to leave go the bandanna loses the duel  --  he 's gen'rally daid , an ' if he ai n't the other man can finish him off . " Again Clay shook his head . By this time over his hot anger , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of his enemy , yet there was with it a curious feeling of elation in knowingthat at last the uncertainty , suspicion , and deeply-rooted mutual enmity was coming to a climax . " No , " he said . " I will ask only one thing of you  --  that you arrange the details of this meeting in strictest accord with the code . " Gonder straightened his portly form . " Very good , seh . " He bowed with dignity . " I see now that my suggestion of the Missouriduel was ha'dly to be considered in a fo'mal affair of honor . A device of our lusty , but unpolished backwoodsmen , seh . " Fortunately Reid Rutledge , with whom Clay shared a tent , was officer of the day , so he was not present when the expected happened . Major Moreland , dignified , tall , with a lean intellectualface and graying hair , waited stiffly on Clay.  | " I have the honor , sir , to place myself at your disposal . I represent Captain Parridine in the matter of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied . " I shall request my second to confer with you immediately . " Gonder came at his summons , consulted with him briefly , and marched off to find Moreland , who had departed . " This matter shall be conducted under the strictest proprieties , depend on it , " were his parting words . Clay watched the heavy figure disappear , and turned back toward his tent . Now that the time of decision was at hand , he had remaining two great worries  --  Merit and Shelby . He had been unable thus far to communicate with the general , who was not in camp . Shelby had spent the night as a guest at the casa of Senor Anda , nor had he returned from the alcalde 's house in the morning . It was reported that he had ridden off on some sort of inspection with Anda and Biesca , and might not come back until late in the day . Clay did not know how soon Parridinewould want to meet him , but he was determined on one thing  --  he would delay this shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He must let Shelby know the truth of what was going on in the Brigade . As for Merit , he was more than happy that she seemed to have decided against any further visits across the Rio Grande . Even if gossip should get loose and run through the camp , it might take a considerable time to cross the river and reach her in Eagle Pass . His thoughts of Merit were tinged with a kind of grieving despair . She had come into his life against his wishes and she had meant to him nothing but trouble . She had overturned his whole plan and prospect for a career , broken the bond between himself and Shelby . . . and now she had withdrawn from him as suddenly and completely as if all these things had not occurred.  | 17This was ingratitude  --  but before the thought was even completedhe was making excuses for her in his own mind . She had not asked him to break with Shelby . She had not asked him to go with her . . . she had told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong as a girl could make it . Clay knew he had only himself to blame . With that he remembered the way she thanked him , that day on Judnich 's platform . His heart grew big at the thought of how gracefully she sat that big sorrel horse of hers , and how deliciously her lips formed the words she spoke , and the little , charming gestures she had , as when she deftly tucked up a wisp of her golden hair . And then he raised his eyes . . . and Merit Hampton was there . She was coming toward him , walking through a group of army wagons , head high like a princess , eyes wide and blue , green skirt fluttering gaily . Good God , was his first panicky thought . She 's here  --  why did she have to come this morning of all mornings ? Why could n't she have come yesterday ? Or tomorrow . . . when things likely will be over ? I must n't tell her . I must n't let her know , not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning ! " Merit said . She was smiling at him , and it was a friendly smile . Then she must have meant what she said at Judnich 's after all . . . as for my impressions of you . . . perhaps they are not as bad as you think . . . That was what she said . It was engraved on his inner consciousness . She wanted to be friends . . . and how he ached to be friends with her . But instead of meeting her mood , he took off his hat formally , and did not return her smile . " I had hardly expected to see you . Is not this your first trip over since the day the Brigade crossed ? " He spoke with a stiff politeness , as if they were strangers , meeting at a lawn partyp2I8 under the oaks of her own Fairwood , instead of being mutual outcasts on the sandy mesquite flats of Mexico . A stiff politeness that denied the offer of friendship in her eyes . " Yes , my first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt look , and something like disappointment came into her face . " The Brigade has been here three days . I thought perhaps you might have joined it again . . . " " The Brigade is no nearer moving , apparently , than when it crossed . And I am still a man without occupation . I would not join it if I could  --  at present . And I do not believe General Shelby would have me , now , if I wished it . " His face was unsmiling , but all the time he wanted to beg her to come sit in the shade of Reid Rutledge 's tent , and talk to him . And keep that friendly look that was dying out of her eyes . But Gonder would be coming back . And Clay did not too much trust the big man 's discretion . He was desperately anxious , therefore , to have Merit go , before something happened and she discovered what was likely to occur before nightfall . She lifted her eyes , blue and troubled , to his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing to depart . " I am afraid I have been standing very much in your way , CaptainBennett , " she said , her voice chilling . " I 'm sorry I seem to find you preoccupied with something now . We may . . . not see much more of each other . Good-by . " She was gone , her back straight and uncompromising . She did not look back . She went on through the parked wagons , and he did not follow . Clay was still standing gazing when Gonder returned . " It 's all arranged , " the red-beard announced importantly . " Moreland an ' Parridine is awaitin ' us down at the cottonwoodgrove . The prelim'naries is to be attended to there . " " Preliminaries ? " Clay asked dully.  | " Yes . Pe'haps I should say , seh , that I have taken a liberty . Actin ' always within the definite limits of the code , I have arrangedterms which on fust appraisal may seem somewhat whimsical . But on sober second consid'ration they will appear both sens'ble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I have felt a ce'tain responsibility in this matter , since I was involved in your clash with Parridine . I figgered your chances , gun against gun , could be reckoned slim , him bein ' a virtuoso , you might say , with a six-shooter . Therefore , knowin ' his mania fo ' a gamble , I suggested the followin ' prop'sition : Two revolvers , one loaded an ' the other empty , will be placed under a blanket . The principals tosses a coin fo ' fust choice , the winner to reach under the blanket an ' draw out a pistol . He 'll be gropin ' blind , unable to see the weapon , an ' may get either the loaded or the empty gun  --  he must abide by that choice . The man who obtains , in this here double lottery , the loaded weapon , meets his antag'nist with the empty one at sunset in the grove down by the river . He will be allowed to fire all six shots in his revolver . If by any chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ' the firin ' be continued , until one or the other is disabled , or honor is considered satisfied . " Clay whistled . The terms sounded fantastic and barbarous . " Consider this , seh . By these terms you have an even chance with Parridine  --  " " Once and for all , " exploded Clay , " I 'm not afraid of that man , gun to gun or any other way ! " " That 's as may be , seh . This is a perfectly blind lottery . If you lose  --  well , you lose . But I fear you would lose in any event . I think Parridine knew his advantage , but the very oddnessof my prop'sition intrigued him . He could not resist the gamble . He seized upon it . " " He did , did he ? " Clay 's lips tightened . " If he 's not afraid of it , neither am I ! Let 's go . " Formal and solemn , Moreland awaited them in the shaded coolness of the trees on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , keeping a bitter silence , his mouth like the thin scar of a healed knife cut , a dark bruise on his left cheek-bone where Clay 's fist had marked him . Moreland conferredbriefly with Gonder . " Everything , gentlemen , is in readiness , " he announced . " The principals will retire a sufficient distance while the weapons are arranged under the blanket . " Clay did a precise about-face and marched off fifty paces into the still woods , where he waited , his back to the seconds , knowing that Parridine , equally correct , had gone in the opposite direction . In a moment Moreland called , and the antagonists returned . Between the seconds now lay an army blanket , smoothly spread on the ground , except for two sinister lumps that bulged it up in the middle . " You , Captain Bennett , are the challenged party , " said Moreland , producing a silver coin . " It is your right to call the toss . " " Heads ! " said Clay as the quarter spun skyward . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is . . . tails ! " announced Gonder , bending over it . " Cap'n Parridine , the fust choice of weapons is yours . " The guerrilla 's still features had not changed , but his black eyes glittered at the blanket , as if by very intentness they might penetrate the thick fabric . One stride forward he took , slid a hand beneath the folds of the cloth , and straightened up with a revolver . His thumb spun the cylinder and for the first time his teeth gleamed . The pistol was loaded.  |p221UNDER  the sentence of death , Clay knew he had behaved well . Men sometimes pale , or allow their faces to fall , when great misfortune overtakes them . He had done neither of these things . Perhaps events had moved too rapidly for full appreciation of their meaning to penetrate entirely into his inner consciousness . Or perhaps he had so steeled himself that even the sure prospect of death did not shake him . He wondered about this , and felt a sort of satisfaction that he could talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They parted at officers ' row . " May I say , seh , that I profoundly admire your bearing ? " said Gonder . Clay entered Rutledge 's tent and seated himself on a cot . It was perhaps well that he was almost immediately interrupted , for brooding would not have helped him . He had scarcely seated himself when a short , nervous figure approached the opening and peered in . It was Major Edwards . " I was looking for you , " the major said . " Have you heard the outcome of Shelby 's conversations with Biesca ? " " No . I had not heard the general had returned to camp . " " He has not . We do n't expect him back before afternoon . I saw him briefly at Anda 's just before he , with Slayback and Collins , left with Biesca and the alcalde to look at some defenses upstream . " " Pray enter , major . " Edwards came in and seated himself on a hard-tack box that served as a stool . " It is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Shelby intends to call the men together , perhapsthis evening , and make the announcement . He is , as you know , a Liberal , and his ideas are all of fighting . Governor Biesca exhibited his authority as commander of Coahuila , Tamaulipas , and Nueva Leon . Then he offered Shelby militarycontrol of those three states , retaining to himself only the civil . He required of the general only one thing  --  full , energeticsupport of Benito Juarez , the president . He suggested that Shelby remain several months at Piedras Negras , to recruit his Brigade up to a division , and when he feels sufficiently strong , to move against Monterrey , which is held now by the Foreign Legion under General Jeanningros . " Clay drew a long breath . How startlingly close to the truth Parridine had come , in his statements to the men in the cantina . He must have prowled about , overhearing the conversation between Biesca and Shelby at Senor Anda 's . When this was announcedto the soldiers , who had , directly or even indirectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top of that , the news became widespread that Shelby had withheld from his men the sub-treasury money  --  an ugly situation could hardly be averted . It could turn very easily into a bloody uprising , for the only thing holding the Brigade together now was its loyalty to Shelby . If that loyalty were destroyed . . . Clay 's alarm over the situation grew at his realization of the cunning with which Parridine had worked . He wondered if he should speak plainly to the major , without waiting to see the general . " What if the Brigade should have other notions ? " he suggested.  | " Ridiculous ! " Edwards scoffed . " The men will follow whereverJo Shelby leads them . They idolize him . He 's going to ask them to vote on this , but it will be a formality . Why do you raise such a question ? " " Just an idle thought , " said Clay . He had decided , under the circumstances , to wait and tell his story directly to Shelby . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edwards continued complacently . " By the way , how would you like to accompany me to the cock main this afternoon ? " " I had not heard of it . " Clay wished the self-important little man would take himself elsewhere . But Edwards was not to be put off . " To be sure ! " he exclaimed . " You left Anda 's early , did n't you ? It seems that during last night 's festivities , our plump friend and Biesca tried to drink Shelby under the table . A great mistake  --  as you and I could have told them . Jo Shelby may not be accustomed to tequila , but he was brought up on corn liquor , cut his teeth on the mouth of a demijohn , so to speak , and has a superior stomach for anything . Senor Anda wound up under one of his own tables , with the governor beside him . The alcalde awoke this morning with a terrific headache and an equally terrific admiration for the man who drank him down . To honor Shelby , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon when they return from their inspection trip , although Biesca , who was very sad and weary-eyed when I saw him , will be unable to attend , since he must continue his military tour . Do you fancy the chickens ? All of Shelby 's officers are invited . " " I suppose so , " said Clay , indifferently . " Excellent ! I 'll pick you up after siesta  --  say about three o'clock . " The major departed , and Clay began the dreary process of killing time . Heavily the hours hung on his hands . He thought of how he had rebuffed Merit , and it seemed a senseless piecep224of discourtesy as he looked at it now . He wondered what Parridinewas doing . At last he lay down on the cot and tried to doze , but the heat grew stifling and he could not sleep . With the swirling Rio Grande at her feet , and the waiting ferry just behind her , Merit watched unwillingly the oncoming of Parridine . She had hoped to avoid him . Two or three things had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insight into what was going on within the man . Parridine let his eyes linger on her too long . He had tried to be possessive toward her . She remembered , also , with violent embarrassmentnow , how she had been in his arms , stunned , hardly realizing , yet indubitably in his arms , the evening of her great disappointmentat the ferry landing . Did he think . . . ? Surely any man , any gentleman , would make allowances for a girl under circumstances of that kind . Her firm little chin went up , even though she would have turned and fled , if there had been anywhere to flee . Bitterly she was regretting that she had come over to the Mexican side this morning . First , there was her indignation at Clay Bennett . Indignation arising out of hurt . He need not have snubbed her so humiliatingly . If he had wished to put her in her place , he might at least have done it so that her whole being did not yet tremble with wounded pride and mystification . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river when she came down to the landing , she might have avoided Parridine altogether . Unfortunately it was over on the American side , and so she had to wait at the landing , counting the minutes , glancingup and down the stream , trying to act unconcerned , yet ready to weep with exasperation when she saw that which she had tried not to think about , yet feared all the time  --  the approachof Quinn Parridine . Obviously he had come seeking her . As he approached withp225his long , springy strides , there was some curious elation about him . Triumph seemed to imbue his face and his very walk . " I was told you 'd been to camp , and I hoped to find you here , " he began . " Yes ? " " I have something to say to you , Merit . Something of the greatest importance to both of us . .. " It was coming now , the thing she did not want to come . Desperately she fished around , seeking to divert him from the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind . " You seem in good spirits this morning , " she told him . " Do I ? Perhaps a reflection of a certain victory . . . " His voice shaded off into indifference , as if the matter were minor . But she would not let it drop . " Tell me about it . Some contest ? Soldiers ' sports are fasci-nating . " " You might say it was a game-a contest , anyway . A sort of combination game and contest . Like chess in a way . His move . Then mine . His again . Mine  --  check . " " So you  --  checked . " " I did . " " And won ? " " Not yet . We had to postpone the finish of it until later on . The checkmate will come tonight . " She laughed self-consciously . " It sounds exciting . I suppose there were  --  stakes ? You soldiers rarely play without stakes , do you ? " It was his turn to laugh . " The stakes , I can assure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you , " she said demurely , drawing back . " Now here is the ferry , and I must return to my lodgings across the river . General Shelby , you know , does n't approve of me . He dislikes having me in Mexico . You 'd think that one girl was ap226menace to the efficiency of his entire army , to judge by his attitude . " " In your case , he might not be so wrong , " said Parridine seriously . " Merit  --  " " The ferry 's leaving . I must say good-by  --  " She was aboard , Pasqual had switched the guide ropes of the pulley , and the current began pushing the scow across the river on its greasy cable . " Wait ! I tell you , this is something important  --  " A yard of yellow water swirled between the boat and the shore . Six feet . Parridine 's mouth clipped shut and he leaped cleanly through the air , landing on the ferry 's deck . Merit gasped . Men were so explosive . Parridine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward them , holding out his hand for a coin . " Here , " he said . " Take it and get forward . Go ! Sabel " The ferryman scuttled forward obediently , and Parridine turned to Merit so quickly that he almost caught the troubled look in her eyes . He was indeed in great good spirits . The highestspirits in which she had seen him since she had known him . Instinctively she fell back a step . He did not seem to notice . " What are you planning to do now ? " he asked . " I  --  I hardly know . " " You have not given up trying to go down into Mexico ? " " No . Certainly not . " " I was sure of it ! My lovely lady , there 's something about you that I take my hat off to . It 's something that does n't go with that beauty with which you charm me , or with your graces and manners , either . You have a streak of steel in you , my dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds it . "  |p227He  took her hand and his eyes glowed with a compelling warmth that terrified her . " You  --  you asked about Mexico , " she said desperately , trying to pull her hand away from him . " Yes , I did . It is this : Merit , I know why you 're down here . Your father  --  I know about him . I offer you my protection to reach him  --  " " But  --  they will not allow me  --  Shelby  --  " Somehow his mention of her father threw a panic into her . " Never mind Shelby . I am not so sure he is going anywhere . Between you and me , I know a few things that may upset some plans . The men are half rebellious , and the whole expedition 's likely to break up here on the border . If it does , what a beautifulchance for a man with boldness and imagination ! One might gather a very fair nucleus of picked men out of that chaos  --  and then he could dictate his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untold wealth , Merit . But aside from that  --  there are you and I , Merit . I want that we should get married . We can do it right here in Eagle Pass this evening , if you 'll only consent . There surely must be a preacher of some kind here  --  " At last she had succeeded in pulling her hand away from his hot grasp , and she recoiled still farther from him . " No  --  I ca n't  --  I do n't want to talk about it  --  now , " she pleaded . His face darkened . " What do you mean , Merit ? " " I  --  oh , I only do n't feel in a mood to be  --  serious about anything  --  this evening  --  " She tried to make her tone light . But there was no sportivenessin those bottomless black eyes of his . Again he had clutched her unwilling hand , and she was unable to avert her face from him . Her cheeks burned and she felt faint . Parridine correctly had assessed her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when she saw there could be no more evasion , she faced him resolutely . " If I have done something that gave you a wrong impression of my  --  my feelings  --  I am very sorry , " she said . " You must make allowances for a girl under circumstances of this kind . I  --  I do n't love you . I consider you a friend . A very dear friend . And I feel everlastingly obligated to you . But , Quinn , I ca n't marry you . You or anybody  --  now . " His face grew carved in hard lines . " It 's Clay Bennett ! " he said , coldly accusing . " No ! Truly not ! Captain Bennett and I are not even friends ! " The ferry was nearing the American shore . " Your answer is no , " he said slowly . " Very well , I will acceptthat for now . But I 'll be waiting . And I am supposing that you are telling me the truth when you say there is nothing between you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imputation ! " She attempted a rebellious flare , but he beat it down coldly . " I 'll be waiting . Remember that . And remember , too , that I offer you your only way of reaching your destination . The Brigadeis out of the question . But Quinn Parridine is going down into Mexico whether the Brigade goes or not . " As the ferry fastened at the shore she half ran up the bank , not looking backward . Slowly the ferry carried Parridine back across the river . She saw him go , and a confusion of thoughts , ideas , and fears struggled in her mind . Fear at first was uppermost . Fear of men  --  all the men in this country of savage men . And this was not natural for her . In all her life before , men always had been deferential and safe , full of compliments , and anxious to do little things to please her . And she was feminine enough to respond happily to masculine attention and masculine personalities . Merit liked men . But in Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlaws , and semi-barbaric Confederate troopers , she had a whole new view of masculine life  --  a rough , coarse , vicious life , frightening to a woman in its ferocious dedication to its central theme of destruction . To her , suddenly , Quinn Parridine typified it all . He knew what she was here for  --  the thought sent a new fear leaping through her and spurred her to frantic thinking . The half-formed plan she had in her mind that morning came back , and Parridine 's last words crystallized it . He had said : Quinn Parridine is going down into Mexico whether the Brigadegoes or not . That meant that she must somehow go down into Mexico , too . She must communicate her plan to nobody . Not even to Gideon Gonder . Because Gonder infallibly would communicate it to Clay Bennett . And of all people in the world at that moment , Merit wanted Clay Bennett least of all to know . It would have to be done tonight . Not possibly could she longer delay it , for her courage would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village as some of the population drifted toward the cockpit . Later such of Shelby 's soldiers as could secure leave , started thither also , and about three o'clock Major Edwards came for Clay , and the two of them mounted and rode over . Passing through Piedras Negras they caught a glimpse of an adobe church at the foot of the street , and before it a lean , brown-robed figure , conversing with a portly man with a great , burnished beard of red . Gonder , thought Clay , was renewing his acquaintance with Father Bartolome . No doubt at this moment they two were wrangling over some point of cockpit finesse . The scene of the afternoon 's sport was an open space somewhatbeyond the village . An area six or seven yards wide in diameter was fenced in by a three-foot hoarding and overlooked on two sides by ranged tiers of seats . The other sides , without seats , were for the commonality , who sat or stood or even sprawled on the ground . Above the stands a canopy of bright cotton stripings was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Confederate section , Clay and the major found seats . Already the crowd was considerable , the Mexican men in enormous sombreros and bright-colored serapes , while the women displayed costumes equally gay.  |p231Clay  glanced about him . Close to the pit , in the center , was a space fenced off for the alcalde and his party , which had not yet arrived . Two or three seats above Clay and to his left , were Major Moreland and Captain Thrailkill . Still farther beyond , with some of the lanky " Texas Irregulars " about him , was Parridine'sdark face . Clay became conscious that Major Edwards was discoursing , a favorite habit of his , like a professor in his class-room : " Cock-fighting  --  what a history it has . Combat between God 's gamest creatures . They fought cocks in ancient Egypt , Clay , and in Greece and Rome . The Latin gallus , meaning a fighting cock , is the very ancestor of our word gallant . " At this parade of classical erudition , he turned toward Clay , his mustaches working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our greatest gentlemen have fought cocks  --  Washington , Jefferson , and Jackson among ' em . I understand that even Abe Lincoln was not above pitting the birds . There are stories  --  I give you my word  --  of famous mains held right in the rooms of the national capitol ! Yet in spite of this eminent precedent , our blue-noses deprecate the sport . Cruel ? Cocks live to fight . I hold that man 's interest in the sport is his classic ambition to dominatedeath  --  and therefore life . A pastime of the depraved , say they ? If that be true , I thank God , sir , that I am a fellow of low tastes ! " From one of the lower seats in front of where Parridine sat , came a familiar rumble . " Jumpin ' Jehosophat , Gonder , if they ai n't usin ' slashers ! " Esau Jancicke , hunched forward so that his beard dangled down between his knees , had his eyes fixed on the handlers at the cages . He and Gonder had just arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the red-beard replied . " These hombres craves action . Fair heels is too slow . " To Clay the jargon was comprehensible . " Fair heels " in the cock-fighter 's parlance , are gaffs which are round to the point ,  |p232while  " slashers " possess razor edges on their under sides , makingthem doubly murderous . Evidently the coming bouts were to be quickly decided . Excitement already was mounting in the crowd as the handlers walked about , displaying their birds . A sudden yelp of welcome , and in a blue-and-orange costume , the gorgeousness of which eclipsed his previous vivid garb , Senor Anda , round and resplendent , advanced with General Shelby , to his place in the stand , his two enormous front teeth shining in gratification at this greeting from his people . " Render unto Anda the things that are Anda 's , " said his whole attitude , and Clay , who had grown to like the harmless , strutting little man , smiled to himself at the alcalde 's almost childish joy . With Shelby and Anda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The arrival of this party meant that it was time to begin the main . Now Clay caught sight of the brown-robed figure of Father Bartolome , his old acquaintance of the Nueces . In his arms the priest was carrying a huge , rusty-black cock , which twisted its snaky head this way and that , as its master bore it to the arena . Something odd about the bird made Clay look again , and he heard the Missourians exclaiming around him . " Damn me , if it ai n't a blinker ! " " Sho '  --  left glim 's plumb gone . " The priest 's bird was blind in one eye . But this handicap did not seem to cool the populace . Voices rose joyously : " Que . Guapo ! Que Guapo ! " And Clay realized that this was the championship cock of which Father Bartolome had boasted . Senor Anda 's teeth still gleamed and his eyes nearly disappeared in his fat cheeks as he radiated cordiality . He rose , bowed to Shelby , turned and made a brief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waved a fat hand . Behind the grandstand were many cages woven of willow withes , stacked high , one on another , and in them cocks crowedp233shrilly and incessantly . Of these birds many were owned by the alcalde , who fancied Cuban Reds and was prepared to back his fighters against all corners for sport , cash , and prestige . At his wave , his handler , a small , swart Mexican with bandy legs , pulled from one of the cages a bird with flaming red and glossy black feathers . Immediately he was faced in the pit by a lean peon with a blue-white cock  --  said to be one of Santa Anna 's own famous breed . Betting was slow on this opening bout . The handlers billed their birds and the angry hackles flared about the serpentine heads . Then the crowd leaned forward with a long-drawn , ecstatic " Ah-h-h ! " The two cocks had flown together with demoniac force , their necks arched , the ruffed hackles giving them the venomous appearance of angry cobras as they sought each other 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over almost immediately . The Santa Anna Blue was dead , the blood from his cut jugular splashing the hoarding . Unhurt , his adversary crowed in an ecstasy of vicious triumph . The edge of passion had been sharpened and now the yells of the onlookers lifted in shrill tumult . Sharp and imperative rose the cries of the bettors . The Confederates joined , wagered their small coins , appraised the ruffled antagonists with narrow , expert eyes . Parridine watched , and the gambling fever burned in his black gaze . " You bettin ' ? " Gonder turned and addressed his words squarely into the guerrilla 's face . Parridine 's mouth tightened . " Perhaps you 'd like to lay a little bet , " he sneered . " Twentyfivedollars on the alcalde 's bird ! " Clay 's eyes were on Gonder 's face , which grew oddly speculativeas the big man watched the flame in the guerrilla 's eyes . " You 're a little steep for a pore man , Parridine , " said the red-beard . " I might rake together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcalde 's second bird , magnificent in its red and black , was being pitted against a nondescript cock , the handler of which was an impassive Indian in dirty white cotton trousers and straw sandals . Awkwardly the fowls flung into the center of the ring and lay there , a sprawl of fluttering feathers . " They 're hung ! " yelled Janeicke , and the cry was echoed by a hundred voices in English and Spanish . Deep in the red bird 's side the Indian 's cock had sunk a gaff . The alcalde 's little handler drew out the spur and cradled the stricken bird in his arms , sucking the blood with his mouth and sluicing a red stream on the earth . As he did so the cock choked , flung up its head , and sprayed the man 's shirt with blood spots . Anda 's second entry was dead , and Parridine counted over five dollars to Gonder . " Double on the next bout ! " said the red-beard gloatingly , and something in his voice seemed to anger Parridine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nigger rich already , Gonder ? " said the guerrilla . " All right . I 'll go you . Ten on the red . " This time the alcalde 's Cuban faced a white-and-black Spaniard , and from the first he was overmatched . With a vicious , scientific , deadly attack , the Spaniard made mincemeat of the other . Parridine paid again . " Easy money ! " chortled Gonder . He seemed to intend to be offensive , and the guerrilla 's face darkened . " Think you know the chickens , do you ? " His voice was ugly . " Pick the next winner  --  and double the bet again ! " " Done ! " Gonder cried instantly . " I back the alcalde this time , for twenty simoleons . " It was the pock-marked Pasqual , the ferryman , who handled the challenger in this bout  --  another Santa Anna Blue . High in the air went the red Cuban , striking malignantly downward with his razor gaffs . A shower of feathers flew and the Bluep235was down . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cries arose from the crowd . Some of the Mexicans in their madness wagered all they possessed . Among the Americans , shrewd individuals like Thrailkill and Edwards , observing how luck was running against Parridine , laid their money against him , and for his prestige he could not refuse their bets . Time and again the guerrilla lost . As one bout succeeded another , fought in a flurry of white , red , or black feathers splashed with blood , only once or twice did Parridine pick a winner . Gambler though he was , it was obvious that he knew little about game-cocks . He had a weakness for a beautiful , flashy bird , and in this particular main it seemed the dingy , battered fowls were doing most of the killing . Uglier and uglier became his expression , and his anger grew , driving him to bet , and bet again , until at last he sat silent and black , able to bet no longer . It was late afternoon when the final battle was announced  --  the eighteenth of the day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought forth the prize bird of Senor Anda 's lot , a scream of admiration and excitement arose . He was a magnificent red-and-black Cuban , imported especially for this match which long had been in the making . As was the custom , he was held aloft to be admired , and his name announced  --  El Gorrion . Haughtily the red bird carried his head , his eyes gleamed wickedly , and his crow was both a boast and a challenge . Now at last Father Bartolome advanced with his rusty , oneeyedbird in his arms . There was a roar of acclaim as the padre carried the cock to the pit . Directly before the alcalde 's seat , Father Bartolome stopped and bowed . Burning-eyed , Senor Anda returned the bow . This was a duel between the men as well as the cocks.  |p236To  a new peak for the day rose the betting , with opinion and backing evenly divided . Almost to a man and a peso the nativeslaid their money on the priest 's black fighter . But the Missourians , experts at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the alcalde 's bird and bet their bottom dollars against the one-eyed fowl . Only Parridine sat motionless , his chin in his hand , taking no part in the wagering . Gonder leaned toward him , leering . " Not betting ? " he taunted . " Not betting ! " snapped Parridine . " I 've got your money , " Gonder grinned , and about him was a patronizing air that brought murder into Parridine 's scowl . " Give you a chance to get it back . A bet where you do n't need no money ! " The guerrilla was silent . " I 'm bettin ' against them six shots in your pistol , Parridine . You know the ones I mean  --  fifty dollars against each bullet . " It was the other 's turn to sneer . " You could n't pay me if I won ! " " Oh , I du n no . " Gonder held up a fist filled with coins . " I done pretty well this afternon . I 'll put up the money all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his eyes fell on Clay . " I get it now , " he said . " Trying to buy his way out , is he ? " " Nope . The cap'n ai n't got a cent in this . I 'm bettin ' you your own money , Parridine . You 're broke , an ' here 's a chance to come back . Take it or leave it ! " For a moment the guerrilla scowled . Just as this moment it was excessively embarrassing for him to be without funds  --  embarrassing and , it might be , even a little dangerous , dependingon the events of the next few hours . A sudden idea seemed to come to him and he glanced craftily at Gonder . " Fifty dol/lars against each bullet ? " he said . The other nodded . " Give me some witnesses , " said Parridine . He turned to where Moreland and Thrailkill sat behind him . " Did you gentlemen hear the terms of this wager ? " he demanded . Morelandunderstood fully what was behind the strange bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suspected much . They nodded together , as witnesses . " I 'll take that bet , " Parridine exclaimed , satisfied . " Five cartridges against two hundred and fifty dollars ! " Gonder 's expression was startled . " But my bet 's on all six ! " " I 'm keeping the sixth , " said Parridine . Gonder flushed angrily . " You 're avoidin ' the intent of my wager , " he protested . " One cartridge  --  " " Is as good as half a dozen  --  " finished Parridine . " Nothing  --  thesegentlemen are witnesses  --  was said about all or none . I hold you to your own terms , Gideon Gonder ! " The red-beard 's form swelled as he took a deep breath . " Very well , seh , " he said at length . " If you choose to hold me to sech terms , I must even abide by them . " To Thrailkill as stake-holder , he counted over two hundred and fifty dollars . The conversation throughout , even Parridine 's slurring reference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those directly in on the secret of the duel could deduce what was behind the bet . " Which cock ? " asked Gonder , as he finished paying over the money . Clay was listening , his ears sharpened by the sudden move which had made the outcome a matter of intense personal concern to him . Knowing all at once how directly he was affected , he thought the red-beard must have lost his wits . Surely he should at least have bargained in an effort to select his own bird . This seemed the sheerest foolishness.  | But he should have known Gonder well enough to be sure the man was no fool . All day Parridine had been betting on the gaudy , bright-plumaged birds . And all day he had lost . Even now it was obvious that his heart went out to the alcalde 's beautiful Cuban , but the unanimity with which the villagers laid their pesos on the padre 's fighter had not escaped him . He must have remembered , moreover , what Father Bartolome had said on the way down from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Parridine . A twist of disappointment or regret seemed to cross Gonder 's face , but Parridine 's gratification was clearly visible . This was sure-thing gambling , very much to his liking . Clay , who now had become the real objective of the wager , sat helpless and silent . If Parridine lost , he was out no money , and the one shot he retained would be enough  --  the guerrilla was supremely confidentin his marksmanship . If , on the other hand , he won , he had recouped his day 's losses  --  and had six shots with which to dispatch his enemy . No power on earth , Parridine felt , could save the man he hated in either event . Gonder turned to the pit , raised his right hand and stroked his beard . Father Bartolome 's eyes were on him , and the priest 's face seemed to freeze . Very slowly the lean old padre took his beloved bird and began to bind the murderous gaffs to its heels . Carefully , very carefully , he sighted along each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he entered the pit and took his place opposite the bow-legged Mexican who clutched the alcalde 's vivid Cuban . In the west the sun was now sinking , and its rays slanted under the edge of the canopy , bathing the bloody circle of the pit in a bright , hard light . Tense silence descended as , priest and parishioner normally , the two men faced each other in the ring , their usual friendship forgotten in the fierce partisanship of the living creatures in their hands.  |p239A  signal from the alcalde and they stepped forward , a yard apart , to permit the cocks to clash bills . Up flashed the gorgeous red hackles of the Cuban and the black ruff of Que Guapo . Away the handlers swung them , then crouched again . A second signal from the alcalde  --  the cocks were on the ground , facing one another , heads low and menacing , free at last to kill . For one beautiful moment they poised , glinting in the sun , despising danger , the bloodthirsty knives glittering on their heels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two at first , followed by a sudden , squattering rush . Before they met they both sprang high in the air  --  the deadly instinct to get above the enemy . Up , up they went , as if climbing opposite sides of an invisible ladder , their powerful wings buffeting , their bills seekinga biting hold , their deadly blades flashing in and out , too swiftly for the eye to follow . Then they fell back , a few fluffy feathers settling with them . Each handler seized his bird and nursed it . Both cocks were bleeding , but neither was badly wounded , and the men sought out the cuts , sucked and spat the blood , and smoothed the ruffled feathers . About the pit massed faces grew avid with excitement . Bearded American faces with furrowed brows and the line of passion from nostril to corner of mouth . Cruel Indian faces with narrow , slitted eyes . This was a fight of fights , a battle to stir the onlookers to their primitive depths . A few seconds of rest and again the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rusty black they whirled and hammered , five feet up in the air . The Cuban was a fighter born and bred , but he had met his match that day , a shrewd , crafty antagonist , who bore upon his muscular body the scars of many battles . " He shuffles ! The black shuffles ! " came a high yell above the howl of the Mexicans . Clay recognized Thrailkill 's voice . There was reason for the yell , because , varying his attack , Que Guapo had gone into his antagonist low , striding wide and quick , set to dodge or leap  --  and suddenly he closed with a superb , killing , sidewise kick . " They 're hung ! " roared the crowd in two languages . From the Cuban came a weak tenor squawk . As the handlers disengaged the birds , Clay saw that the padre 's black had sunk a gaff to the hilt in the red cock 's side . In a deafening crescendo that hung over all , the yelling of the Mexican villagers arose ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only Parridine smiled . With that terriblewound upon him , what chance had the Cuban now against the black killer ? The guerrilla already was counting in his mind his winnings . Que . Guapo had a gash on his thigh and a cut in his breast , but his one good eye was as bright as ever and his breathing hardly more rapid than normal . This way and that his snaky head twisted , keeping everything within range of that one precious eye . The rest-period ended and the priest set him down again  --  released him to finish his foe . But Que Guapo did not finish the Cuban . He was down . From the crowd came a scream of surprise and consternation . The black had been placed on the ground so that momentarily his blind side was toward his enemy . A moment only . Already Que Guapo was wheeling to see his foe ; but in that moment the red cock struck . High in the air he flashed , his wings fanningso that the breeze was felt by spectators twenty feet away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stabbing murderously . Had he seen it , Que Guapo might have fended off the blow with beating pinions and leaping legs . But the split second in which he lost sight of his antagonist was the end for him . Down on the ground he sprawled , his skull cloven , his brains spatteringthe ground . Feathers flew as the red cock struck viciouslyp241again at the limp black body . But the coup de grace was unnecessary . In a throaty , blood-choked voice , the alcalde 's champion proclaimed his victory . And out of the crowd that hung around the pit babbling incoherently or struck speechless with blood-lust and amazement , crept a crushed old man , red rust stains of blood on his brown robe . Tears ran down his leathery cheeks and in his arms he cradled the dusty body of a dead black cock . " Little brother , forgive , " sobbed Father Bartolome . " Like Judas I betrayed thee  --  but I did it to save a fellow man . Is it not our duty , enjoined by the dear Cristo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ? . . . And yet he meant nothing to me , while I loved thee , little brother ! "  |p242THE  sun , a glowing coal on the horizon , glared through the tree trunks , and Clay removed his jacket in the cottonwood grove , standing in his white shirt and holding in his hand the useless , empty pistol . Ten paces away stood Parridine , implacableand contemptuous of the last-minute efforts which both Moreland and Gonder had made to persuade him to give up his purpose . During those arguments Clay stood wearily at one side . He wished they would stop it . Moreland and Gonder made themselvesappear futile and undignified with their useless reasoning , and thereby detracted from his own dignity . He knew that he was going out of the world . . . they might at least let him go out with self-respect . He had been unable to speak with Shelby after all . The generalhad been too occupied with Senor Anda and immediate concerns to see him , and Clay had to hurry to meet his appointmenthere under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in some manner he would see that the informationreached Shelby . . . after . The thought of Merit kept recurring , a sad and yet somehow a sweet thought . He resolutely drove it out . He must not permithimself to think of her . In a few minutes everythingp243would be ended . He must keep his mind on the business of being killed . Clay knew Parridine had been drinking , but not enough to unsteady him . He seemed , indeed , as sure of himself as if he could reach across the space intervening between them and place the muzzle of his weapon against Clay 's forehead . Clay supposed that a man  --  even Parridine  --  would need a drink or two to steady him for the shooting down of another man in cold blood . Their arguments ended , Moreland and Gonder took their places to one side . There was strong disapproval on the watchfulface of the former , although he was Parridine 's second ; in the frown of the latter , as he kept his shrewd little eyes fixed on Parridine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wore in his hat was a symbol of something very real to Parridine . He had never been inclined , even under ordinary circumstances , to the weakness of mercy ; but now severalthings combined with his own hatred to make him remorselesstoward Clay . " Are you ready , gentlemen ? " asked Major Moreland , his face gray as he stood with his back to the setting sun . " Ready , " said Parridine . " Ready , " Clay answered , tight-lipped . " Remember the conditions ; I will count twenty . Within that count you must fire , Captain Parridine . Your fire is limited to one shot , due to the wager you made this afternoon . " He paused and looked at both of them . " Gentlemen , ready ; One . . . two . . . three  --  " Now it was coming . To Clay it seemed hours between each slow count . Parridine 's hand remained by his side , then rose slowly , the barrel of the revolver foreshortening , until its round black hole fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aim , but Clay looked at him unblinking . Like a steel trapp244Parridine 's jaws closed , the biting muscles knotting hard to lock his long white teeth. "  --  four . . . five . . . six  --  " went on Moreland 's voice . Crash ! Clear across the space between them the flame from Parridine'spistol seemed to spring at Clay . White smoke blotted out the guerrilla 's set features . Clay half-swayed , regained his balance , stood still and erect . White , tense , the faces of the seconds turned toward him . He knew he should collapse , fall on his face , permit the darkness to close over him . But he remained on his feet . An incredible truth was dawning . He was unwounded . Parridine had missed . It might have been the liquor , or perhaps this was the vagary of the one chance out of a thousand , but the man who never missed had missed his great , climactic shot . " Christ ! " Amazement , disappointment , and rage were in Parridine 's gulping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Moreland together . " No . " To Clay it seemed someone else who spoke . . . his words came as from a remote distance . Across the thirty feet of grassy sward he saw Parridine 's face twisted with hate . Suddenly , frantic with consternation , Gonder 's voice rose : " You have no second shot , Parridine ! " Clay , rooted motionless , saw the guerrilla 's long arm rise the second time . " The condition , " Parridine told them coldly , " was that one shot was to be fired at Bennett ! You fools ! Anyone would know I did not fire at him . I never miss . I merely let him smell death . This time I shoot to kill ! " Clay stood there . The revolver steadied . He might have thrown himself to the ground ; or run , dodging this way and that ; or begged for mercy . And he felt a surge of pride that itp245did not occur to him to do any of these things . Knowing death was certain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revolver suddenly spun from Parridine 's fist . Fifty yards away the solid shock of a Sharp 's rifle shook the leaves of the underbrush , and acrid white smoke curled and eddied . Clutching a sprained wrist the guerrilla staggered back , staring with unbelief at the weapon that had been driven from his grasp by an ounce of lead . Gonder and Moreland , who , knowing they were too late , had sprung forward as Parridine raised his revolver the second time , now pounced upon the weapon . At the same moment a stark figure , gaunt , huge-footed , and black-bearded , stepped from the bushes , a rifle smoking in its hands . " I got another ca'tridge hyar , " said Esau Janeicke . " One leetle move , Parridine , an ' I drill somethin ' mo ' impawtant than a six-gun . " But Parridine made no effort to move . Major Moreland , havingregained his breath , drew himself up , his face cold with contempt . " In years of witnessing affairs between gentlemen , Captain Parridine , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see anything like this , " he said harshly . " I take the liberty , sir , of denouncing you as a scoundrel and a cur , and it shall be my duty to inform every officer in the Brigade of your infamous con-duct ! " " I did not violate the agreement , " Parridine insisted doggedly . " The first shot was purposely wide  --  " " Sir , you lie ! These gentlemen will bear me out that you lie ! It will be well for you to get out of this vicinity as soon as possible . The men in Shelby 's command , of all ranks , have nothing but loathing for a cheat , a liar , and a would-be mur-derer ! " Blankly Parridine stared at them , his mouth drawn andp246bitten . Then , without another word , he turned his back and , nursing his wrist , tramped away into the gathering dusk . Moreland turned to Janeicke . " That was a shrewd shot , ser-geant . " " It was Gonder 's notion  --  I jest held the sights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a snake , an ' jest to make things safe he axed me to lay back of them bushes an ' see nawthin ' onreg'lar happened . When Parridine come up fo ' the second shot , I raised easy with the ole Sharp 's . Figgered to shoot the gun outen his hand . Done so . " Voices , calling and approaching , sounded in the dusk . The darkened wood seemed full of men , all talking , all questioning . The camp had been aroused by the two shots fired so close to it . Clay heard Moreland : " An affair of honor . Nobody , fortunately , injured . " The desire came suddenly to escape from the mob , and Clay slipped away through the trees . He found himself threading his way among the opaque black trunks , a hand held out to fend off the bushes . Then he was in the open , under the stars , the eveningbreeze rustling . The last of the after-glow was fading from the sky and the earth was a bowl of blackness around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stopped and filled his lungs with the sweet night air . He was alive . It was wonderful to be alive . . . A bugle began singing in the camp . Another and another joined it . In quick succession they sounded " First Call , " then " Adjutant 's Call , " and finally " Assembly . " Something was happening . Something big . Clay 's own great crisis had so dwarfed everything else during the last twenty-four hours , that he had difficulty now readjusting his outlook to the normal . For a moment he stood listening to the distant tumult , the shouting of orders , and the hubbub made by many men.  |p247Then  suddenly he knew what it was for . Shelby was parading the Brigade . He was going to put his plan before the men . And he did not know about Parridine . . . A row of leaping fires sprang up startlingly in the early darkness  --  fires previously built by order , and now ignited to illuminate a level area south of the camp , on which , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their men . Clay leaped forward , heading at a hard run toward headquarters.  |p248GENERAL  SHELBY stepped outside his tent , buttoning his coat and feeling the wisp of cool night breeze on his forehead . The buttons were spaced in threes , a nuisance to fasten when you were preoccupied with something else , but a mark of rank like the twisting galdns on the sleeve . Although the night was warm Shelby buttoned the coat snugly . He must face his men and he wished to look smart as possible . For some reason he was nervous . This he was determined to permit nobody to perceive . Within the tent the two lanterns had not yet been darkened and a broad path of light washed out from the entrance , warmly illumining the faces nearest Shelby . Edwards and Slayback were conversing in undertones , their eyes occasionally appraising their superior . Outside the focused glow , other figures were less clear so that the general had difficulty distinguishing his staff members . Shelby was accustomed now to the deferential aloofness of his officers . He stood alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over . The thought , strangely , increased his confidence now . At one time he had distrusted himself heartily , but that was before it dawned upon him what an advantage he possessed because of the image of him his men were creating in their minds . Anp249image wholly unlike reality , but valid because they believed it . The image could do things that flesh-and-blood could not . Shelby took care to live in that image these days , and found himself behaving in ways he never would have done in order to preserve the illusion . This he was willing to do , even at considerablecost in effort , because only one important thing existed in the wideness of the world to him  --  success in the campaign ahead . Shelby finished buttoning his coat and pulled the front down tightly over his chest . He shifted his saber belt and his chin rose , the beard pointing grotesquely through the dark , as he ran a finger around the inside of the collar . It was at that moment that he heard the voices . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. " Edwards ' face was pallid in the lantern light . Shelby 's brows knit . He had not forgiven Bennett for that night in Austin . Especially after he found the captain at Eagle Pass . Edwards , however , seemed insistent . " Bring him up , " said Shelby grudgingly . He saw in a moment , however , that there was something here to be got at . Young Bennett was breathing heavily , as if he had been running , and his face was wet with perspiration , and grimed on one cheek . " General , may I speak  --  in private ? " The edge of excitement in the voice , obviously controlled by force of will , decided Shelby . " I reckon , " he said sourly . He stepped into the tent followed by the captain . " General Shelby , " the officer said with intense earnestness , " there 's trouble in the Brigade , sir . " " How do you mean ? " " I mean , sir , that you 're sitting over a mutiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Without knowing any detail , or what was behind it , Shelby felt a sickening pulse of apprehension . Somehow he knew that Bennett was telling him the truth . " Explain , sir ! " His words cracked like pistol shots . The captain explained . Insubordination , he said , had been bred among some of the men . How many he did not know . But he begged leave to suggest that there were so many that the situation was dangerous . " When did you learn of this ? " Shelby was tensely alert now . He knew of it the previous night , the captain said . But he had been unable to reach the general . " I 've been available this evening , " Shelby snapped at him . " Why come now , when I am at the point of going before the men  --  " " I could not come before , because of a matter of very personalbusiness . " Shelby brushed that aside . He would never have brooked a reply so tinged with what sounded like impertinence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How did you get this information ? " the general demanded . Captain Bennett paused as if to marshal his facts . " I heard him last night , sir , while you were at the alcalde 's  --  " " Kindly be specific , sir . Him ? " " Your pardon , general . I refer to Captain Parridine . I heard him , as I say , talking to some of the men . He was asserting to them that you were doing nothing for them ; that you 'd bargainedfor a governorship by turning them over as chattels to Biesca and Juarez  --  " " The hell you say ! " Captain Bennett nodded . Parridine , he asserted , had been helped by a dissident element in the Brigade . Bennett had reason to know that a certain group which had been enlisted atp251Austin , the remnants of a guerrilla organization " Ha ! The Irregular Texas Cavalry ' ! " Shelby had been watching to see what those outlaws would be doing . It was showing up now . Bennett said , Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread his poison . But he wished to inform the generalthat what Parridine said about Biesca was not all . " The thing that made the men listen , sir , " the captain stated , " and what caused some of them to show signs of becoming ugly , was the way he put it up to them about your refusal to let Governor Murrah divide among them the money in the Austin treasury . " Shelby tugged at his beard , his brow furrowed now and his eyes glittering dangerously . This would tell against him . He wondered how far the dissension had spread and what he could do to stop it . I can put Parridine under arrest , Shelby thought . No , I lack the real authority for that , he immediately amended . Parridine is not under my command , and I am not backed by the power of government . He has as big a voice as I have . " Thank you , " he said to Captain Bennett . " This information , sir , may be very valuable . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the very issue of joining Juarez . " Shelby remained in the tent momentarily , after Captain Bennett withdrew , staring at the ground . Well , he thought , I 'm ham-strung perhaps . But I 'll see what the men say . He composedhis features , and when he stepped out of the tent it was the confident , cock-sure Shelby his officers saw . The staff followed the general 's stocky figure to a slight rise of ground which gave a commanding position , and there Shelby took his stand with his staff behind him . Officers of the line barked briskly as the Brigade marshaled itself in close ranks ,  | with Edwards dressing the line from the left . Shelby never forgot that scene . From twenty huge bonfires , flames leaped skyward , lighting rows on rows of rough , bearded faces . The general appraised those faces expertly . Allowing for the disreputability of their garb , which in the erratic firelight was not so very apparent , there stood before him as fine a fighting unit of its size as existed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help exulting in the knowledge . Most of the men in the ranks were tall , inclined to gauntness , cleareyed , and hard-featured . They had the assured bearing and promptness in obeying commands that marked them as experiencedsoldiers , and if their uniforms were shabby , their arms were bright , and their ranks very straight . For the life of him , Shelby could not believe that any disloyaltyto him existed in those men he was looking at . " Attention ! " he heard Edwards ' voice . " The commanding general wishes to address the command ! " Shelby stepped forward , and every face in those ranks turned toward him , expressionlessly expectant . For a moment something akin to stage-fright caught at Shelby 's throat . " Men of Shelby 's Brigade ! " he heard himself begin . His tone was high and rasping . He controlled his voice with difficulty , and got on with his speech , sawing at his sentences , fumbling with words . He never could speak well except when he was emotionally stirred . Just now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spoke he watched with growing concern to see the effect of his words . Far down at the far end of the line , barely hinted at by occasional high-leaping flames , he thought he saw a lurking , shadowy figure  --  Parridine . Was the guerrilla standingback in those shadows to watch the result of his scheming ? As he got into his speech Shelby felt more assurance . He out/lined his proposal to join Juarez , very frankly , and with it the corollary plan to remain at Piedras Negras for recruiting . Nothing to hold back here . Yet even as he uttered the sentenceshe realized how closely they coincided with what Bennetthad reported as Parridine 's utterances  --  so much so that the general was not surprised to observe , here and there , indicationsof restless stirring in the ranks . That restlessness was ominous , he knew , even as he talked on  --  for these were no new recruits from civilian life . They were bitter , outlawed men , perilous to deal with when they thought themselves unfairly treated . By the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposely made it short  --  glances were being exchangedin the lines . The crisis was approaching . " Men , you 've heard my proposal , " the general said , his eyes running up and down the ranks . " I will not order you to do anything against your will . We 're comrades and free men . In this moment of decision , let me hear from all who wish to speak ! " He stood looking at them . And slowly a scene began to form which rarely in all history had its duplicates  --  a military body holding debate with its commander . First the ranks buzzed . Here and there fierce arguments broke out . On his mound Shelby stood patiently waiting . At last a soldier  --  a private  --  was pushed forward and stood respectfully addressing the general : " If it please ye , seh , " he said , " the boys wants to know what about jinin ' Maximilian and the white folks in this country  --  what 's wrong with them ? " This was the idea that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instantly . " Men , if you 're of my thought , " he said , " it will be Juarez and the Republic . For four years we 've been fighting for freedom against the usurpationof the North , and , as I see it , Juarez is carrying on a sim- ilar struggle . We have here the nucleus of a fine army , and a way open to the French outposts . According to the faith in us will be the measure of our loss or victory . You 're acquainted with Biesca 's offer . What he fails to perform , I 'll guarantee we 'll perform for ourselves , so when this game 's played out , there will be mighty little laughing , by God , over any Americanstrapped or slain by treachery ! " But still the uneasy buzzing continued in the ranks . Another soldier presently stepped forward , a scarred and ragged veteran this time , with sun-bleached eyebrows and a sandy beard . Shelby recognized him and called him by name : " Hendy Tobias ! A better fighting man never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear from Sergeant Hendy ! " On the sergeant 's freckled face was a look of embarrassment , but the men behind him encouraged him in stage whispers and undertones . " Gen'ral Shelby , " said Tobias at last , " thar 's a story goin ' about . The boys would like to hear the straight of it . What I refer to , seh , is the repawt that when the gov'ment offered to give the Brigade back pay  --  three hundred dollahs apiece  --  yo ' would n't let us have it . " Clamor came from the ranks . " Yeah ! " " Tell us about that ! " " What is thar to that story ? " " Why was n't we axed ? " Scores of voices took it up . They sounded threatening and hostile . Major Edwards and Colonel Slayback exchanged uneasyglances , but Shelby did not allow a muscle to alter as he faced his men smiling . " Silence ! " bawled the adjutant . " The commanding general ! " Immediately , obediently , quiet fell on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For all itsp255implications , Tobias ' question had been asked without any evidence of disorder in the ranks beyond the mere stirring when the men took council with each other . The spokesman had stepped forward . There was , perhaps , a menacing sound in the voices raised to demand an answer to the query , but thus far at least the Brigade was anything but mutinous . The men awaited an answer  --  an explanation . In the meantime their ranks remained straight , and every face was turned toward the general . Shelby 's smile faded . Here was his supreme test , and he knew it . If he failed now to convince these men , his Brigade was lost , all his great plan and adventure were blighted before their inception . There was , moreover , real peril in the situation . Shelby glanced down at the shadowy far end of the line . Yes , the dim figure still was there . The general drew a deep breath , summoned every bit of force within him , and took another step forward . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice rising . " I have heard these tales spread , and I welcome the chance to reply to them ! I want that there shall be perfect understanding among us . Every man in this Brigade , to the newest private , shall have his say . " He paused . Then the lethargy that had gripped him fell from him . His voice became alive , appealing , and the words rushed easily to his lips . Almost , for all the danger of the moment , Jo Shelby began to enjoy himself . " The agreement , " he continued , " was that every major question of policy , once we entered Mexico , was to be submitted to a vote . But until we reached Mexico , I was in command , my orders unquestioned . The incident at Austin was in the purlieu of my authority , and I acted  --  but I acted as I thought every man in this Brigade would have me act ! " Now was the great moment  --  both for Shelby and his Brigade.  | He felt that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had appealed to the sordid and selfish in them  --  Shelby would appeal to something different . " It would have been easy to accept the money  --  three hundred thousand dollars it was . But there were certain overriding considerations . Men , you know what the world would say  --  is its malice worth the paltry sum we would have received ? We are ragged , true ; penniless , true ; exiles , true . But we belong to as noble a race as ever trod this green earth  --  the soldiers of Dixie ! Not for myself , nor for you , but for the sake of the land that we all love and fought for , I made the decision ! We are the last of the race  --  " here Shelby 's voice became low , and reverent . Then it rose like a trumpet : " Shall we not be the best as well ? " Not once had he appealed to the selfish instincts of his men . It was sheer , romantic idealism Shelby uttered  --  a practical politician would have scoffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered skillfully , and Shelby did know his men better than did Parridine . A hoarse voice cried : " Hooray fo ' Ole Jo ! " And all at once they were roaring , hats waving , the Rebel yell shrilling . The tumult rose and towered above the valley , the air seemed to rock . On his mound Shelby felt for one instant the great leap of pride and exultation . Then he stood , a smile on his face once more , waiting for the noise to spend itself . Graduallyit subsided . He ventured another glance down the long line toward its shadowy limits . The dim figure that had been there had disappeared . " Thank you , men ! " said Shelby when at last he could be heard . " Your approval means much to me . But we must settle this other thing we were discussing the matter of joining Juarez and the Mexican Republic . Are you still of the opinion expressed awhile ago ? " In after years , Shelby was to look back on that as his major 7mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of a question . Had he swept them along on the crest of their enthusiasm he could have done with them what he wished . But the question set them to thinking ; and the thinking reminded them of the remarkable fact that they had a right to a voice in the matter ; and that right , as is always the case when a right is suddenly realized , seemed more important at the moment than the issues involved . The men were Missourians chiefly , and Missourians are notoriously hard to convince in all forms of debate , demanding to " be shown "  --  although quick to rise to any appeal to honor , loyalty , or courage . Shelby knew as soon as he had done it , that he should not have set the matter before them in the form of a question . He could almost see the new mood in the faces of the men . After a moment of silence , a spokesman again was pushed forward . " Gen'ral , " he said with great respect , but with stubbornness revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yo ' awdeh it , we 'll foller yo ' into the ocean . But afteh all , we ai n't interested in this hyar Mexican shindig . We done come down heah  --  most of us  --  hopin ' to find a place in Mexico whar ouah folks kin come an ' jine us . We 're willin ' to fight fo ' that foothold  --  but , gen'ral , we 're white folks . We done fit the race question all ovah America . If we got to fight , we druther fight alongside white folksfo ' Maximilian , instid of Juarez an ' them Injuns of his ! " It was a statement worthy of attention , and a situation almost without precedent . A common soldier was challenging the judgmentof his general in command . But grunts and nods in the ranks left Shelby in no doubt that the trooper had expressed a popular opinion . There was a suggestion of tenseness in the general 's hard cheek line , but otherwise no change in his expression . Nobody , looking at him , could possibly have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with vivid clarity the needful moves if he was to avert a new disaster.  | " Is that your answer , men ? " came Shelby 's voice . " Aye ! " " It sho ' is ! " " Yippee fo ' Maximilian ! " As the shouts came from the Brigade , Shelby took a new iron hold on himself . There was now no trace of hesitation in him . In a single second he reversed his entire plan . The pill was a bitter one , but his smile again split his whiskers . " Then it is my answer too ! " he exclaimed . " The general takes his commands from his men ! " Once more the storm of cheering arose . The men whooped it up for Shelby because he was a good fellow . Not yet did they know what a capitulation he had made . Shelby understood how relieved was the Brigade over his agreement with it , as he listened to its voice buffet the air . But he was thinking with lightning speed  --  thinking ahead of his men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him forever . HenceforthShelby would in truth take his commands from his Brigade  --  unless now , instantly , he re-established his ascendancy . He permitted the noise to subside before he spoke again : " Henceforth , Men of Shelby 's Brigade , we fight for Maximilian  --  butit is really a continuation of our battle for Dixie . I want you to realize now , as you prepare to launch on it , that you have chosen the harder course . Between us and the outposts of the emperor 's nearest military force is much country  --  very savage , barren , and all but waterless country  --  peopled with the soldiers of Juarez who tomorrow will be our deadly enemies . As citizen soldiers we have settled this matter between us ; but let every one of us remember that henceforth the discipline is restored . Never before have we stood in such need of common action and common purpose . " He ceased speaking , and let the grim truth of what he said sink into them . After a moment he resumed :  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bravely , to obey orders as cheerfully and quickly , as if we were constantly in the heat of a major engagement . Now , men , let there be no complaining . You have chosen the Empire , and perhaps it is well ; but well or ill , your fate and fortune are mine . We march for Monterrey . The road will be thorny and hard , but perhaps on it we may find a sprig or two of laurel ! " Once more the men cheered stormily , and Shelby saluted , then turned smartly on his heel . A moment later the line officerswere dismissing their companies , and the staff was looking with a new vast respect at the man who had won that last cheer from his soldiers . The cheer was the Brigade 's endorsement of all the general had said ; it restored him , by free consent of all the men , to the authority and power of military command . Perhapsfew realized it , but within the five short minutes that had passed , Shelby 's Brigade had gone through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment of its commander ; had asserted the right to determine its own action ; had verged on mutiny and disintegration into a mob ; and had been brought back once more , through the strength of its leader , into a disciplined fighting weapon . But Shelby , in the privacy of his tent , was removing from his body garments soaked as wet as if he had been in a downpour  --  soakedwith the sweat of his tremendous mental strain . ANGEL WITH SPURS 261p260PARRIDINE was gone . He had slipped away when he heard the men voice their first roar for Shelby . A guard at the horselines , where the guerrilla had been allowed to keep his mount , said Parridine had come very quietly and called for his buckskin horse , and then ridden off somewhere into the darkness . Shelby sent for Captain Thrailkill . " Take a detail , " he said . " Round up those sixteen Irregular Texans . ' I want to have a talk with them . " Thrailkill saluted , departed , and thirty minutes later returned to report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But first the general sent for Senor Anda . Consternation spread itself in exclamation points all over the fat face of the alcalde as the general explained the new developments . Shelby sympathized with the little Mexican , as he thought of the shock it must have been to be aroused from a dream of peace and preferment , to learn this disconcerting news . " Madre Dios ! " the alcalde wailed . " Biesca  --  what weel he say ? " He rolled his eyes , half in appeal and half in speculation , at Shelby  --  and something in the glance did not , somehow , go with the man 's flaccid character . " I 'm sensible of your position , " the general said , " so I'mp261going to give you something to show your friend Biesca . See that battery of brass cannon ? I doubt if Juarez has guns like that anywhere in his army . I shall leave those guns here  --  in exchange for provisions you shall furnish me . Sabel " Senor Anda considered the proposal , his eyes on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need ? " he asked cautiously . Shelby began enumerating  --  so many sacks of soccoro , or corn grist ; so many quintals of salted beef ; so many loads of frijoles , which are the red Mexican beans ; and so many arrobas of onions . Shelby had known his men to fight the Yankees a major battle over the possession of a few bushels of onions , and he was going to see now that they were well supplied . The general was asking only what was easily procurable . He wanted no more than he could transport , and it was immediately apparent to Senor Anda that he was being offered the artillery at a magnificent bargain  --  particularly inasmuch as Shelby , if he chose , had the power to commandeer the foodstuffswithout paying anything for them . The alcalde showed his gratitude by frankly and gratefully acknowledging these facts . " Gracias ! Mil gracias ! " he exclaimed . " Esta generoso , mi general ! " " I shall need these things quickly , " said Shelby . " ' Sta bueno . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Concern clouded Senor Anda 's countenance . " Thees I am mos ' sorree to hear , amigo , " he protested . " Ees mos ' dangerous to go jornada del muerto . I suggest . Plenty bad mans . El Gato  --  hombre malo ! El Gato own thees desert . Hide  --  shoot  --  keel . Ees mos ' deefficult to go to Monterrey , if El Gato say Alto ! ' Ees death ! Ah , amigo mio , stay here in Piedras Negras . We weel hall more fiestas , more rims de gallos. "  | " My thanks for your concern , " replied Shelby , " but we 'll have to take our chances with your friend El Gato  --  " " No , no ! Ees not my amigo ! " protested Senor Anda . " El General Shell-by  --  he ees my amigo " " Very well . But we must go on . " The alcalde 's chubby features assumed a tragic expression , he sighed deeply , and his shoulders rose almost to his ears in a shrug that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said dolefully , " Senor Anda hall geev solemnwarning . " He clambered on his horse and trotted sorrowfully away through the night toward his village . Shelby gazed out after him . " If that man was n't so fat and little , " he said after a time , " I 'd pay close attention to him . " He thought a minute , while he combed his chestnut beard with his fingers , then chuckled . " Ca n't help liking Senor Anda . Little man with big talk , hey ? He 'll send a messenger to Biesca , of course . I could have avoided trouble by neglecting to tell him my plans . But he deserves a chance to justify himself . Let him go . " Gideon Gonder was deadly serious . " I tell you , she 's gone . I searched Eagle Pass fo ' her . She disappeared last night . " The words jolted Clay . Over the Rio Grande channel the night mists were shredding away and he could see in the morningsun the distant clutter of houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ferryman ? " he asked . " Most ce'tainly . Pasqual never brought her over . But Par-ridine  --  " " I realize she could have been transported across in another boat . But why Parridine ? " Clay 's tone became ugly because he knew he was going to hear what he did not wish to hear  --  the reason why it must be Parridine.  | " There 's somethin ' I ought to 've told you long befo ' now , cap'n , " said Gonder . " A delicacy about discussin ' the pussonal affairs of the Hamptons kep ' me quiet . But now I 'm shore Miss Merit 's gone off into the desert with Parridine . I 'm goin ' to tell you why . " Somberly he gazed out across the valley . " The thing goes back to when things popped wide open in Missouri at the start of the war . Jedge Hampton lost his law practice , because he was Secesh an ' the Yanks controlled the courts . He he'ped me out of trouble an ' I come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Federal river garrisons . Fust , all the niggers run off . Then the Yanks commandeered our cawn an ' hay  --  without pay , because we was Secesh . Then Jennison 's Redlegs come over from Kansas an ' stole most of the hosses an ' mules . Ginger , that sorrel of Miss Merit 's was a little colt then . She saved him by hiding him down in the woods under the river bluffs . " Gonder paused to gnaw off a chew of tobacco from the plug he carried . " No use goin ' over the harrowin ' details , seh . You know the usual formula . Quantrill was in the country , supposed to be a Confed'rit , but he did more harm than good . Whenever his gang made a raid , the Federals would take reprisals on the nearest Southern families . That 's how the jedge lost his cattle an ' hawgs  --  an ' the household silver . " He harked back , counting his stubby fingers . " It was March  --  no April  --  two years back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of co'se we did n't have nothin ' to do with the massacre  --  the jedge denounced it as much as anybody . But when the raiders scattered to hide , one of Quantrill 's captains come to Fairwood , an ' the jedge felt obligated to he'p him . It was Parridine . The jedge concealed him on the premises . Pretty quick he made the acquaintance of Miss Merit . She did n't like him at fust  --  told me she thought him very thin an ' sinister.  |p264I  think she was scairt of him . But you know Parridine  --  them fine manners of his'n . An ' the jedge considered him a gentleman . To make it short , befo ' long him an ' Miss Merit was pretty good friends . " Clay 's jealousy leaped at that , but Gonder did not see it . " The jedge an ' Parridine would set together fo ' hours , " he said , " talkin ' plans . The jedge never took me into his confidence like he done Parridine . Fo ' instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ever hear about it , seh ? " Clay nodded . It was the one fantastic , inconsistent thing about Judge Hampton  --  his belief in that " gold mine . " As the judge 's law clerk , Clay had handled papers and taken care of business details which familiarized him with many of the judge 's affairs . The " mine " had been sold to the judge by a Kentuckian named Moulton Spooner , who acquired it as a grant from Santa Anna . But Spooner contracted an aggravated case of tropical dysentery and was on his way home to die when he stopped at Fairwood , where he sold the Mexican property . Judge Hampton had known Spooner for many years and had faith in him . Frequentlythereafter the judge spoke of going to Mexico to inspect the " gold mining property , " but travel was difficult and somehow he never went . To Clay the whole thing seemed unreal , chimerical , almost childish . " Because of the Lawrence affair , " Gonder continued , " Gen'ral Ewing , of the Federal fo'ces , ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Waverly , the Yanks burned plenty of homes . I pe'sonally obse'ved the smoke from this arson fo ' days . An ' finally the Jayhawkers come to Fairwood . The jedge saw them in time to let Parridine get away ; but his hoss was recognized , an ' so was he . It was that buckskin of his  --  an ' hoss an ' rider was marked particular in that murderin ' day at Lawrence . I thought the Yank captain was goin ' crazy with rage.  |p265He  arrested the jedge an ' me . An ' then they burned Fairwood down . " Clay gnawed his mustache and swore . He knew and loved Fairwood and almost as vividly as if it were happening before him , he saw the fine stately mansion in flames  --  the big white pillars , the hall with the polished floor and crystal chandeliers , and the beautiful curved stairway with its handsome handcarvedwalnut balustrade , brought all the way from England . " They threw me an ' the jedge in jail at Lexington , " Gonder was saying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jedge was tried by drum-head court-martial . They 'd been wantin ' to get him fo ' a long time . He did n't even have a lawyer to defend him . They was goin ' to shoot him , but Miss Merit begged so hard fo ' her pappy 's life that the provost finally let the jedge off with a ten-year jail sentence , an ' a fine of two thousand dollars , for harborin ' a enemy . Miss Merit an ' I talked to the jedge befo ' they took him back to his cell . He was sick an ' old , but he thought if he paid his fine they 'd free him , an ' wanted us to get the money somewhere . " Gonder turned his earnest face to Clay . " Now here 's where I do n't know all the cyards . I could n't raise no money  --  or mighty little , anyway . It was Miss Merit got it  --  an ' from Parridine . I knew he had some brass . Carried it in a money belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at the little hamlet of Blue Springs , over in Jackson County . Cap'n Bennett , that gal had the nerve to ride over there  --  in among them drunks an ' murderers  --  to find Parridine . " The big man mopped his brow with emotion , and Clay picturedthe courage that sent a fragile and helpless girl on such an errand among Quantrill 's violent and vicious men . " But after all that trouble , " Gonder said , " an ' after the jedge paid his fine , they would n't let him go after all  --  he had to serve the ten-year prison sentence . He went back to his cell.  | That night he escaped . He had friends , you see . " His voice ceased , and Clay surmised that in this untold story there was at least one friend of the judge who wore a great red beard . " So Parridine saved her father , " said the captain . " Saved him , but got him into trouble in the fust place ! " cried Gonder with the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than any decent gent would have done . " " Agreed . " " After the jedge was gone Miss Merit stayed in Lexington . An ' as the months passed , Miss Merit got a feelin ' that grew into a ce'tainty . She figgered her pappy would go south . He was too old to fight , an ' it would be only nat'ral fo ' him to go down to Mexico to look at his gold mine . She got absolutely shore the jedge would be somewhere in Mexico . One day she spilled this to me . I admit , seh , it do n't sound logical , but she was so set on it I could n't argy her out of it . So I had to come along to sort of take care of her . She got hold of a little money from friends of the family , an ' that 's how we come , her wearing , that old unifo 'm you saw her in fust . How Parridine got on to it I du n no , but he found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merit 's a mighty determined gal . She 's goin ' down where her father is  --  no matter what the hardship , an ' the risk may be . " Clay did know the rest . Parridine was gone . And Merit was gone  --  on the same night . It was something he could not argue against . Clay stood in the tent before General Shelby and saw the uncompromising coldness in the general 's eyes . It was days since the disappearance of Merit and Parridine , and though every effort had been made to find which direction they had gone there was no more information available now than when the effort began.  |p267Of  one thing there was a reasonable certainty  --  it was into Mexico they had fled . Gonder was convinced that nothing could turn Merit from her purpose to go on to where she expected to find her father . Only a promise to take her to the judge , he submitted , would have induced her to go with Parridine . It was Major Edwards , who had always retained a friendly feeling for Clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into the Brigade . And that was why Clay was before Shelby now . Shelby had been convinced against his will and it made him bad-tempered . " I understand , sir , that you wish to rejoin the Brigade , " he said sourly . " I do , sir . " " I suppose you think you should be reinstated in your former position on my staff , now that you 've so far condescended as to offer your distinguished services to this command ? " Shelby was elaborately , heavily sarcastic . " I had only hoped , sir  --  " " Very well . I 'll tell you what I 'll do for you . " The general leaned suddenly forward across his table , his eyes flickering under his heavy brows . " I 'll give you the meanest , dirtiest , most dangerous job in the army . Want it ? " " What is it , general ? " " You see , Edwards ? " Shelby threw himself back in his seat and turned scowling to the adjutant . " He begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , I had no intention of bargaining , " protestedClay respectfully . " I meant merely to ask for my orders . " " Ha ! A different tune ! Very well , I 'm going to put you with the scouting command . " " Why  --  that would be fine , sir ! " " Do n't plume yourself , Captain Bennett . This is no gildedp268assignment you 're getting . Wait until you see the detail I 'm giving you ! " He turned to his orderly . " Have Thrailkill bring the scouts over ! " The man departed at the double , and Shelby sat silent , drummingthe table with his fingers . Feet hammered outside , and there was a shouted command to halt . " Here are your scouts , Captain Bennett . Let 's look at them . " Almost vindictively , Shelby led the way out of the tent . It was Clay 's first thought that a joke was being played on him . Were these to be his scouts ? Hang-dog , slack-chinned , slouching , they stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then he knew this was no joke , because of the four men who stood at file-closers ' positions behind them . Esau Janeicke . Hendy Tobias . Two of the stanchest sergeants in the Brigade . Catfish Caruthers , the hard little corporal of the Tyler detail . And Gideon Gonder . There was no joke about those four men . Clay knew what was expected of him now . The scouting detail was to be very dangerous . Shelby intended that these offscourings , driven by Clay and his four non-commissioned officers , should feel out the dangerous route of march for more honest men . Shelby was expecting him to whip those sixteen bushwhackers into useful shape as scouts . And the job looked all but impossible.  |p269THROUGH  the unending dust rode the Brigade , the men hunched in their saddles , a frieze of gaunt , ferocious riders on lean and weary horses , splashing a wild panorama across miles of Mexican desert . Two by two the troopers rode , beards grayed to a common dun hue by the stifling dust . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  save what they carried in their canteens  --  since dawn . Shelby 's Brigade . Ishmaels of the world ; an outcast ragged army without a country , or even a flag , for which to fight . Two days ago , before the command left the Rio Grande , the men had seen the battle banner of the Brigade ceremoniously buried under the waters of the river , so that no Yankee could ever boast he had taken it . Now , flagless and countryless , Shelby 's men rode doggedly down into the unknown . It was habit that kept them together  --  habit and Jo Shelby . By all the world 's standards they were lost men , broken men ; yet jests continually ran up and down their column . Their two days of marching had put them deep into Mexico . It had taken Senor Anda a week to fulfill his provision commitmentsto Shelby , and the first day 's march , while hard and hot , had been through a country comparatively open and notp270dangerous . Clay had been given an opportunity to feel out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure . As scouts and trail finders the men were apt enough . And most of them were fairly competentwith their weapons . Courage they might lack , but Shelby had assured them grimly that the first one who failed at his duty would be shot , and that he , Shelby , would personally oversee the job . The sixteen " Irregular Texans , " Clay had discovered , were by no means all Texans . There were half a dozen Arkansawyers , and a Tennessee mountaineer or two , a bayou dweller from Louisiana , and a couple of half-breeds from the Indian Nations . The rest were Texans , but not to be mentioned in the same breath with the fighting men in such commands as Hood 's or Fagan 's Brigades . These were riff-raff . And yet Clay was not altogether dissatisfied . He had two things in his favor . The " Irregular Texans , " who had been arrestedthe night of Parridine 's escape , were so happy to evade a firing squad , that they were eager , at first at least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best non-coms in the Brigade . Gonder he made a corporal . With the two sergeants , and Catfish , he had subordinates whom he could trust to any extent . He was , moreover , beginning to think he was winning the respect of the " Irregular Texans . " And some things about the men made him half believe that given a chance to rid themselves of some bad habits , these men might make good soldiers . The Brigade was approaching a more broken country than it had hitherto traversed , a country of foothills and arroyos , where a lurking enemy might easily conceal himself . And the time was at hand for Clay to take up the position in advance of the line of march . He had just sent Caruthers back to find Gonder and Janeickep271who had lagged at the rear on some esoteric business of their own . Now he heard a roar of voices , and turned in his saddle to see the pair , followed by Catfish , riding forward along the column , a storm of hoots and calls following their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone in the Brigade . Esau was renowned as a singer and story teller , with , like most of his mountaineering kind , a prodigious memory for the balladsof his native hills . Gonder also was amusing , full of wit , and with his harmonica he made up a musical team with Janeicke . Now , tired and thirsty from the long day on the march , Shelby 's men craved diversion . " Give us a stave , Esau ! " called a soldier . " Yeah ! How about Ole Jo Shelby 's Mule ' ? " But Janeicke rode silent , wagging his dangling black beard , apparently deaf to importunities . Beside him , Gonder was equally indifferent . " Wet his throstle , an ' he 'll obleege , " someone suggested . The words were acclaimed . " Who 's got some licker ? " " A dram fo ' Esau , to lubricate his pipes ! " From somewhere down the line a bottle was passed forward  --  a pint container in wicker , partly empty . Esau , who up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle , " hefted " it in his hand to judge the contents , nodded as if in assent , tipped back his shaggy head , and drained half of it . Admiring howls greeted the act . " Look at him ! " " Jest like pourin ' it down a rat hole ! " " Terrific , ain ' it ? " " Esau  --  the tank of onknown depth ! " The mountaineer accepted these tributes with a grin , and passed the bottle to Gonder who , in four giant gulps , drained it . Then Esau brushed a few drops from his horsetail beard andp272settled himself in his saddle , while Gonder fished forth his harmonica and made ready to accompany . A time or two the scout cleared his throat , and suddenly , in a most astounding bass , he roared out the first stanza of the song called " Old Jo Shelby 's Mule " : The Union folks away up nawth was one time much afraid ' Bout somethin ' comin ' from the South  --  they said it was a raid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye will jest keep cool , It had long ears an ' a long slick tail , an ' was called Jo Shelby 's mule ! A cheer came from the column and the whole line of riders crashed full-voiced into the chorus : Shout boys , an ' make a noise ; the Yankees is afraid ! Thar 's somethin ' up an ' hell 's to pay when Shelby 's on a raid ! Esau waited for the chorus to subside and took up other verses . They ran as follows , with the chorus at the end of each : This mule , he ai n't so very big , but then he 's got the grit , An ' every time he gives a snort he makes them blue-coats git . Sometimes he 'll jump into their fields an ' eat both cawn an ' oats , An ' when he 's nawthin ' else to do , he 'll drive away their shoats . The grinning brigade , gleeful in the knowledge that it possessedthe most notorious foragers in the Confederate army , howled delightedly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then Esau continued with his song : Once this hyar mule went on a spree up clost to Lexington An ' every time he give a jump he 'd make the Yankees run ; An ' comin ' back through ole Saline he got into a trap , Kicked up his heels , scairt ole man Brown , an ' come back safe to Pap . That was a reference to the now almost legendary Boonville raid of ' 63 , when Shelby eluded the encircling Federal forcesp273under General Brown , and returned safely to the main Confederatebody commanded by General Sterling Price , known to his men as " Pap . " Almost immediately followed a stanza which commemorated the Westport raid of ' 64 , and the bafflement of General Rosecrans of the Union army : Ole Rosey got a long deespatch , which come from ' way down east , " Say , ye take thutty thousan ' men an ' try to ketch that beast . " To obey awdehs he was bound , but said Abe was a fool , An ' had n't halter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a waggish tilt to his battered hat , Esau embarked on some new verses of his own composition . Each was tinged with lewd humor , and each was received with tumult growing in proportion to the unprintability of its concoction . This was the song of Shelby 's Brigade . It belonged to the men-a heartfeltoutburst of an unknown author , who made up for lack of quality in his verses by his intense partisanship . And here , at the end of a weary , heat-smitten day , when men and beasts were near to dropping from exhaustion , Shelby 's troopers rode down into Mexico , forgetting their lank bellies and parched throats as they sang their ballad recklessly . Young Lieutenant Kirtland galloped back with a grin , and saluted Clay . " The commanding general 's compliments , captain , and will you be so good as to report with your men ? " As Clay rode up , Shelby glanced impatiently around . " See that canyon ahead ? " he said . " Do n't like the looks of it . Want it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side , or I 'd never think of going through it tonight . " Before them a deep gorge opened its throat , with two rugged , almost naked foothills flanking it on either side . Clay studied the threatening cleft for a moment , then trotted forward with his detachment . The Brigade at last was in hostile territory . Thus far it had met no opposition , but nobody , least of all Shelby , thought for a moment that Juarez and the guerrilla El Gato , would permit the command to march much further through the desert unopposed . This , therefore , was to be the initial test for Clay 's newly formed scouting force . The canyon had a dismal , eerie look . Three or four hundred feet high its steep walls soared on either side of the road , yellow and red , tufted with occasional clumps of dust-colored sage , or yucca . Properly deployed in a rocky throat like that , a handful of resolute rifles might keep an army indefinitely at bay . An angle cut off the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered that an uglier place could hardly have been found for testing untried and undisciplined men such as he had under him . Deeper into the shadows of the crooked trail he rode . He was most anxious to make a clean showing in this first functioningof his scouts . Shelby 's cordiality had in no wise increased during the week at Piedras Negras during which Clay worked with the detail . Once or twice the general appeared suddenly , watched the drilling and listened to Clay 's explanations of certainmaneuvers , then rode away without a word of praise , criticism , or suggestion , leaving his captain of scouts chilled by his bearing . Clay 's horse shied from a boulder in the road  --  a boulder , he idly considered , which would have to be moved to one side before Shelby 's wagons could come through . Then he noticed fresh earth clinging to the rock , and his gaze shot upward on the canyon walls . He could see it now  --  the scarred face of the cliff down which that boulder had very recently bounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had seen distant , scurrying horsemen coasting the Brigade 's line of march  --  enemy scouts , probably , since the country seemed to possess no peaceful inhabitants . There was now no question of the immediate menace in thisp275canyon , and Clay , anxiously glancing back , observed that his men , even that hardy pair Janeicke and Gonder , were looking uneasily at the heights and down the dark and narrow twisting throat . He held up his arm for a halt , and turned his horse so that he faced them . " We 're going through here , " he said with unsmiling grimness . " Twenty men and an officer ought to be plenty for a job like this . But if we are n't , we 're not going to be coming back . " He paused to watch them as they digested his words . " They ai n't expectin ' us to go in thar all alone , is they , cap'n ? " whined a voice . Clay recognized it as belonging to Rufe Champion , to whom these " Irregular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Champion must be handled crisply . " Sergeant Janeicke and Corporal Gonder  --  fall out and take position at the rear of the detail ! " he ordered . " Now , men , " he said pleasantly , " if you follow me and obey orders , everything 's going to be all right . But if any of you do n't  --  make your wills . Sergeant Janeicke ! " " Yes , seh ! " " You and Corporal Gonder will shoot at sight any man who hangs back or fails to do his duty ! " " Yes , seh ! " said Janeicke . " Detail , forward  --  trot ! " commanded Clay , leading the way once more down the canyon . They came to a place where the bottom of the gorge dished out into a brief , flat valley . There , by the side of the road , huddleda group of small white crosses . Frequently on the road down from Piedras Negras they had seen them  --  the little crosses spiked into the barren soil by the wayside . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volition , like the organ cactus and the tree yucca . Always they marked spots where murders had been committed , and this group may have indicated the massacre in the gorge of a coach-load of passengers by bandits or guerrillas . Clay wheeled his horse aside from the ghastly markers , and his men followed , glancing askance at the sinister cluster . High on the canyon wall to the right , a rifle shot erupted , multiplied instantly a hundred times in sound by the shattering echoes it awoke . Toward the rear of the column a man spun out of his saddle . Smoke jutted out in a dozen new places above , and the shocking racket of the valley was made more hideous by the screaming of slugs ricocheting from the rocks about them . " Dismount and take cover ! " Clay shouted . On the face of the rock wall not a yard from his head a round splash of silver suddenly appeared . " Jesus ! " screamed a voice of panic . " They got us ! Jesus , they 'll kill every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was swinging his horse around , flogging it with his reins , trying to get it into motion and out of that canyon of death . Fifty yards back , Janeicke threw his rifle almost negligently to his shoulder . Smoke coughed from it with the report , and Champion 's horse dove headfirst at the ground , somersaulting , while the rider flew through the air , crashed , and lay still . Janeicke 's shot seemed to have a tonic effect on the other troopers . Not one of them moved to follow their recent leader . To a man they were hurling themselves out of their saddles , and snuggling behind the loose rocks of the canyon floor . Carbinesbegan to crackle . " Ye fools ! " snarled Esau , who had hurried up from the rear and dismounted . " Make them bullets count ! " His Sharp 's came up , steady as the boulder behind which he crouched , and the canyon echoed to the shot . A yell lifted from Clay 's men . High up on the wall , a dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled over and pitched off , hit the out-bulging face of the canyon wall , turned over in the air , and struck the bottom with a sickish thud . More dirty white figures suddenly appeared , scrambling in ant-like panic toward the top of the high ridge . Again Esau fired , and swore when a distant puff of dust very close to one of the climbers showed his miss . Nor were any hits scored by the ragged volley from the other scouts . The fluttering figures tumbled over the crest and were gone . " Injuns ! " grunted Esau . " Lipan Apaches ? " Clay asked . Shelby had been warned of these desert marauders . " I 'll take a look . " Leisurely the scout mounted and rode forward . Clay turned to Sergeant Tobias . " Who was hit , Hendy ? " " A boy named Toad Hashinger , seh . From Arkansaw . Done fo ' . Will yo ' take a look ? " Clay went back . They had turned over the stricken trooper , a bushy-headed , black-bearded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of middle age . Both hands still clutched at the ragged hole in his chest where the bullet had ripped through his lungs . His beard was a sticky mass of blood . " Lay him aside , back of those boulders , " Clay directed . " Shelby will have him picked up and properly buried tonight . " Almost without thinking , he picked up Hashinger 's canteen . The man had been thrifty with his water . The container was half filled , and Clay hung it on the side of his saddle . Esau came ambling back . " Yep . Must be Lipan Apaches , " he reported . " Britch clout an ' knee moccasins . Rag tied around his haid . Cotton shirt . Got him right through the ears , " he added complacently . " What about that man who tried to run ? " Clay asked  | " Him ? He ought to be all right . I shot to kill the hoss . Champion 's jest stunned , " said Janeicke . Two troopers ran back and between them lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and though his head ached and he was deeply crestfallen , he received no serious injuriesfrom his fall . His saddle and equipment were transferred to Hashinger 's horse which was unwounded , and Clay sent CatfishCaruthers back to report the skirmish to Shelby . Then he ordered two or three men to scramble on foot up each side of the canyon , and advance along the ridge to unmask further possible ambuscades . " No need of that , " Esau said . " Thar wo n't be no mo ' trouble with them Injuns today . Kill one an ' it plumb discourages the rest . " In spite of that opinion , Clay worked his way through the canyon slowly . As Janeicke predicted , there were no further signs of the enemy . And now the captain began to observe some satisfactory symptoms among his men . They had been blooded , and the brush with the Apaches was what they needed . As they moved forward , a new confidence was apparent , they obeyed orders almost smartly , and showed a new cohesion . Champion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and he rode silent and morose . A half-mile farther on , the defile opened up into the mesquiteflats again , and almost at once , in the bottom of a shallow valley ahead , the scouts saw that which brought a yell from them  --  the glimmer of a pool of water . It was the desert " tank " Shelby had expected to find . Camp would be there , and Clay knew that there was not a man in the Brigade who would not welcome it . Even his jaded horse quickened to a trot , its ears pointed eagerly forward . Behind , the men began to joke together . Their spirits had risen with the near prospect of water and with thep279memory of their own recent exploit . Some of them rode almost swaggeringly , and Clay did not mind that . A little confidence would not hurt these men . All at once Clay threw up his head and sniffed the air . A taint was coming toward them as they approached the pool . " Somethin ' dead , " muttered Tobias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinct warned that this something was far more malign than a stray dead cow . They were nearing the laguna now , and an indescribable odor washed over rock and thorn to them , so revolting and powerful that it was almost palpable to the touch . Involuntarily the detail halted and the men all stared . " God ! What 's them ? " asked Gonder . At first Clay could not make them out  --  dark , bulbous shapes in the water . Then he knew . Dead animals . Horses , driven into the little lake and shot ; purposely left there to bloat and undergo their dreadful chemistry of putrefaction , and spill their poison juices in the water . His stomach seemed to turn over within him as a new , stronger effluvium was swept toward them by the hot wind , and his heart sank . This was where Shelby had planned to camp and rest his men and horses . The Brigade had been without water for a day . . . who knew how far it was to the next drinking place ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced himself to ride down to the stagnant pool , and he had to spur his horse cruelly to make the poor creature advance the last few yards . The scouts remained where he left them . As he came closer to the water , he saw it was a wide , shallow sheet of green slime left over from the spring rains . Around its edges for fifty yards the mud had dried and cracked , showing how the drouth had diminished the pool ; and there were the old pocks of countless hoof-marks on its border  --  tracks of cattle and other beasts . Now , however , since man had polluted it , no animal came near.  |p280A  dozen carcasses blotched the surface , each with its swirling swarm of black flies , some swelled to bursting with their internal gases until legs stuck out at ugly , awkward angles ; others alreadyburst open and spewing their awfulness into the pool . Holding his breath , Clay forced his horse fetlock deep into the water ; but though the animal was famished for a drink , he merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were upon him . Then Clay rode out of the laguna and dismounted , kneeling on the verge to scoop up a palmful of the nauseous liquid . It came up , oily and green , and thriving with animalculae . In spite of himself Clay retched violently at the stench , spilled back the water , climbed on his horse , and rode , white and gagging , back to where he could breathe air less polluted . " Gonder , " he said , when he had mastered his pallid stomach , " go back to Shelby and tell him the condition of this water supply . " Already the head of the Brigade was debouching from the gorge , a mile back . Gonder rode , glad to be away from the tainted air ; and presently Shelby trotted up with his staff . His face darkened as he listened to Clay ; then he rode down to the edge of the laguna , tested its horrible waters as Clay had done , and came back hastily . " Willfully polluted , by God 's gullet ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intend to fight , is it ? Hell 's fire ! And no more water in twenty miles , as far as my maps show . Edwards , pass the word to march at least a mile beyond this cesspool  --  to where we can breathe fresh air at least  --  and have the troops fall out . Let ' em sleep  --  if anybody can sleep . " Weary and grumbling the column rode by , and the grumblingswere changed to sharp and angry cursing when the condition of the lake was learned . They made camp on a level patch of sand and rocks , and the troopers routed out and killedp281no less than a dozen rattlesnakes before they could begin lookingabout for places clear of stones and cactus on which to spread their blankets . But after that first outburst of heartfelt rage , the work was done quietly and without complaint . Shelby 's men were accustomed to having the unreasonable happen to them . The only difference was that this particular kind of misfortune had never happened to them before . Even while the camp was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canteens that still had water in them , and piling them in a heap near the center of the camp area , with a guard posted over them . Water was going to be at a premium soon . Some of the men gave tired grins . " Wo n't be no cookin ' tonight , boys . " " I ai n't carin ' . Not hongree , somehow , afteh a whiff of that lake . " " Might try some of that hardtack dipped in the daid hoss juice down yondeh . " " Gawd , Robinson ! Shet yo ' trap , afore I puke ! " But if the troopers did not complain another part of the contingentdid . At a distance Clay saw a bustling delegation from the civilian train , shouting and waving indignant arms at Shelby , who was answering them with a patience at which Clay marveled . After a time they went grumbling back to a bivouac which , it must be admitted , was cheerless enough to evoke grumbling from men more philosophical than they . Clay thought of something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so it had not been taken up , and he had forgotten about this other . He found it , shook it , and felt the swish of water within  --  there must be nearly a pint of it . Not much , surely , but enough to make a waterless night endurable . . . except that duty forced him to turn it over to the water patrol . As he stood considering this , an orderly halted before him and saluted . " Cap'n Bennett , General Shelby 's compliments , an ' will you be so good as to repawt at once ? " Clay set the canteen down beside his saddle and walked over to where Shelby was pacing , in earnest conversation with Slaybackand Edwards . " The matter 's very serious , " he was saying , as Clay reported . " I ca n't go back  --  it 's thirty miles that way to water , and besides it would mean giving up everything we 've started out to do . We 'd be defeated before we even began the campaign . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water for my men and horses . The map shows a well twenty miles farther on . But a dead animal in that well . . . " He looked at Clay . " Captain Bennett , I want you to get your scouts ready for immediate duty . " " Duty tonight , sir ? " " Duty in five minutes ! This tank  --  it may mean that we have water pollution to face all the way to Monterrey . There 's a well twenty miles from here  --  little settlement of two or three adobes . Water 's good they say , but we  --  ca n't tell until we reach there . I want you to ride there tonight and take possession of that well , and hold it . They may not have fouled that water , since the people in the village are dependent on it . It 's a gamble , but I want you to get there as soon as possible and see no damage is done after you arrive . " Clay stared at him . This was asking the impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any rest , to do twenty more miles that night . . . " Well , what are you waiting for ? " snarled Shelby . Clay saluted and made a smart about-face . Then tramped off , his back stiff with indignation . Within a few paces he heardp283his name called . It was Major Edwards and what he said took all the indignation out of Clay . " In four years of war , " he said , his face blurred in the eveninggloom and his voice lowered , " this Brigade 's never been in greater peril than it is at this instant . Shelby admits it . That well 's our only chance . We can just reach it  --  Shelby can get twenty miles more out of these horses and men , but damned few after that . He 's going to let the command rest four hours , and then we 'll be after you . Find that water , lad , and protect it . If you do n't  --  God help us all ! "  |p284THEY  were five miles out of camp into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission they were on , and he was glad that it was too dark to see their faces . The sudden droop in them was apparent , as the realization came to them of what they faced . " Our hosses  --  can they stand it , seh ? " said one of the Texans , his voice scared and weak . He knew the fate of a man left horseless in this desert . " They 'll have to stand it , " said Clay grimly . " I 'll promise you all this  --  no man 's going to be deserted . Stick together , and obey orders . We 'll make it all right . " He spoke with a good deal more confidence than he felt , but he had taken the precaution once more to put two men he trusted at the rear of the column  --  Tobias and Caruthers , this time . He needed Janeicke and Gonder up ahead to help him find the trail . In complete silence they rode under the star-spattered sky , with the shadowy mystery of the night-shrouded waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding their way through this blackness , and their horses already weak and stumbling from thirst and weariness . No trotting on this march . Clay kept his column at a walk , checking every half hour to breathep285the mounts . Beside him rode the vast bulk of Gonder , while Janeicke ranged up front , his eyes catlike in the night . Mile after mile passed and there was no conversation among the men . The horses ' hoofs were muffled by the deep powdery sand , so except for a creak now and then from a saddle leather , or the occasional clink of a bit , they seemed to be drifting cloud-like through the gloom . A wind came up and lifted the fine sand , making little cloudy puffs where the hoofs fell , discernibleeven by starlight . Clay hoped that wind did not grow strong enough to raise a sand storm . From the flat canteen at his flank came the indistinct gurgle of water to his parched senses , and he realized how thirst was catching at his throat . All the men were suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had passed from the mouth and tongue and become a thirst of blood vessels and deeper tissues . Long continued , such thirst drives men mad . Unless luck was with them , many of Shelby 's soldiers would know the craze of that mortal thirst before another sun set . Unconsciously Clay licked his lips at the liquid sound of Hashinger 's canteen . But he made no move toward it . That water was sacred , for another purpose . An hour passed . Two hours . A century of hours . Clay 's horse stumbled once or twice , a certain sign that the animal was nearingthe limit of its endurance . After a long time Janeicke halted and grunted . " ' Dobies , seh . " He had seen them first  --  the bulking shapes of buildings in the gloom . There were no lights . Clay sent Janeicke and Gonder forward to investigate . They were back almost at once . " Nobody thar , " Esau announced . " Houses gutted . " An electric impulse of fear shot through Clay . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in the village are dependent on it . Shelby had said that . Hopefully . But there were no people in this village to be dependent on the water . Might as well face the truth , though . In dead silence Clay led the way forward . Even in the darkness he could see now the violence that had twisted and torn at this place . Whole sides had fallen or been thrust out of the three small adobe huts , and the simple furniture within had been heaped together and burned . " They must have been on the wrong side , " mused Gonder in a hushed voice . One of the men called that he had found the well . Before he reached it  --  Clay knew . The stone curbing about its mouth had been broken and tumbled in , a rubble of spiteful destruction . Up through the rocks poured a deadly stench . Clay struck a sulphur match , waited until it was burning well , and dropped it down . Something was in there . Something dead . . . not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So that was what they did to those people .. . Even Esau seemed pale under the desert stars . " What 'll we do now ? " he said . Clay shook his head mutely . Fifty miles from water , with the Brigade already feeling its way toward this place  --  he knew these things but something within him resisted the full graspingof the frightfulness of the situation . He felt numb , yet knew the ultimate agony of realization would not long be delayed . " By Jesus , a light ! " Gonder almost startled them with his croaking cry . Clay 's eyes followed the dim arm , pointing . In the distance , indistinct against the night sky , the outline of a mesa reared itself . They all saw now what Gender had seen first  --  a tiny needle-point of brightness against the crouching black mass . " People ! " Clay exclaimed . He thought for a moment . " A guerrilla camp , maybe , " he said to his men . " Or a sheepherder'scasa . Or maybe an Indian jacal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water where that campfire 's burning . How far is it to that mesa , Esau ? " " Hard to tell at night , seh , but mebbe five mile . " Clay ordered the men to mount . Somehow they had to reach that light . It was almost pathetic to see the quickness with which they got to saddle , and how every man of them , even the stark Esau and the bumptious Gonder , turned to him for orders and leadership . He was the only hope they had now , and upon them was the sick terror of death by the most horrible of ways  --  thirst . Of the next two hours he never after had a clear recollection . They were like souls mad with an obsession . Not only their own lives , but the lives of a thousand comrades and friends depended on their reaching the light  --  and finding water there . This was what Senor Anda had meant when he warned Shelby of El Gato . Across the rough , thorny country they struggled ; Janeicke , with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no trail , but by some kind of instinct he groped his way in the dark , leading his horse , avoiding the pitfalls of yawning arroyos , inching his way around mogotes bristling with a million tangled growths of spears , making detours when a climb was too steep for their staggering animals , but continuously working upward and toward the objective they sought . Every man in the detail was on foot now . Gasping , stumbling , dragging their horses after them , they struggled after the scout . Sometimes the tiny light disappeared  --  and Clay 's heart would die , for he knew that without the beacon they never could hope in this darkness to find the spot . But then they would round some buttress on the side of the mesa , and the friendly pin-point would spring into view again . At last Clay called a halt . " I have a little water here , " he announced to the men . " Not enough to go around . A pintp288would n't be enough even for one of us  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll dip it in the water and let it soak . Each of us can at least wet his tongue and lips by sucking on it . " To the scouts even this , in their extremity , meant relief . They took turns , though the water gave out and the last men who sucked the cloth received little beyond the spittle of those who had preceded them . Even so the dampness did wonders for them , and it seemed to change their luck , too , for dawn began graying in the east , and suddenly Janeicke cried : " Trail ! " In their weariness some of the men laughed with weak joy , a dangerous hint of the near-hysteria they had reached . Up the last severe scramble they pulled and hauled their groaning horses , to the narrow little path that wound about the face of the mesa , skirting the base of the abrupt escarpment of caprock which topped it . Obviously the trail was well-used . Day began to brighten . They had mounted again , and now they rode around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halfdozenbeehive huts . " Jacales ! " yelped Esau . With a howl they spurred forward their horses at the best speed the animals could raise . Out of the thatched dwellings broke dark figures and plunged down the mountain into the underbrush . Riding in the lead , Janeicke swung low from his saddle and seized by the single scanty garment which clothed her , a little girl . She was the only personremaining in the village by the time the scouts reached it , and she was screaming with terror . Gonder dismounted and took the child from Janeicke . He squatted on the ground and placed her on her feet . Slowly he began talking to her in his halting Spanish . After a time the child ceased to weep and answered timidly . Presently she laughed at some funny thing the huge , red-bearded stranger said to her . Then she talked freely , and at the end Gonder turned to Clay.  | " The water 's under an overhang , seh , at the head of the arroyo jest beyond , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muchacha says cattle an ' hosses has watered there sense she can recollect , an ' all the water fo ' the village comes from it , an ' fo ' lots of folks passin ' by  --  an ' she ca n't remember that it ever was dry . " " Let her go , Gonder , " said Clay . The big man grinned . Presently he gave the child a small pat and allowed her to scuttle into the underbrush . They rode on a hundred yards or so , rounding another buttress , and saw a savage arroyo which gashed its steep and crooked length down the side of the mesa , showing where , in times of heavy rainfall , some watershed above poured its stream . The steep face of the mesa here was covered with an ugly tangle of thorny brush , but the twisting bottom of the arroyo had been swept by freshets comparatively free from undergrowth . In places it pitched almoststraight downward , and Clay thought of how it must look when a torrent roared down it . But it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They saw the overhang of the rock , and it was exactly like many another overhang they had seen . But for the informationGonder had obtained they might have passed it without knowing what it hid . Now , however , with Clay leading , they scrambled up the detritus of broken rock and there  --  a wondrous sight to thirsttorturedmen  --  found a cool , deep cavern containing a water hoard , fed by some fissure above during the heavy rains . It was a form of water tank not uncommon in the Mexican desert , but which seemed to them miraculous now . Laughing and slapping shoulders with relief the men crowded eagerly , and plunged their heads into the water like horses to drink their fill . Clay waited until they were finished , then drank also and felt like a new man . The water was brown and about its edge were cattle hoof marks . Not only had the beasts drunk here , but they had waded in the pool and staled , for the water tasted and smelled powerfully of urine . " Cow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and refreshing to their parched throats , and there was never a complaint . Afterwardthe horses were allowed to fill their skins , and then Clay permitted his little troop to sit on the rocks and consume some food . It was wonderful how quickly both men and horses were strengthened and revived . The scouts began to take an interest in things outside of themselves . It was now broad daylight , and miles away on the gray-green desert , they marked for the first time a distant ribbon of dust  --  Shelby 's column . Nearer to them huddled the tiny broken squares of the ruined adobes they had visited last night , and in the intense clarity of the atmosphere they could almost make out the full picture of the destruction . It would take Shelby at least an hour to reach that point , Clay estimated , and it was time to get to horse and begin to work a way down the face of the mesa in order to intercept the Brigade . He ordered the men to mount . Without any warning a sudden incarnation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light talk of the men died in their throats . A voice spoke from behind and above : " Put up your hands . You are prisoners ! " Clay knew the voice , and knew that with the voice went the power to enforce the command . Slowly he raised his arms and his scouts followed his example . " Keep facing that way , " came the next order . " You are covered by thirty rifles . I am sending a man down to take your weapons . " " So , Parridine , " said Clay with slow contempt , " you 've turned renegade ! " " Why not ? " asked the guerrilla . " If Shelby was not abovep291riding with the Juaristas  --  before he was otherwise convinced  --  why should n't I ? " Defying the threat and command , Clay turned his head . More than ever like a wolf Parridine looked , standing twenty feet above the trail on the top of the rim-rock . While Clay and his scouts were resting , the renegade and his men had stolen up across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the top of the cliff and there were the ugly muzzles of rifles . Clay 's men were at Parridine 's mercy . " I ought to kill you , Bennett , for disobeying my order , " the guerrilla said . " But I have another use for you . Do n't make the mistake , however , of lowering your arms . " Beside Clay , Gonder and Janeicke were swearing deeply and wholeheartedly under their breath , but not a scout dared to move . " To forestall any foolishness , " said Parridine , " I 'll inform you that I have men posted on the trail in both directions . There 's no possible escape for you  --  even if you tried to go down the mountain , we 'd kill you all in ten jumps . " " Why not kill us now ? " Clay asked . " Not because of any lack of desire , " replied the renegade , smiling thinly . " I have orders . El Gato wants prisoners . " Clay chilled . The Mexicans sometimes did dreadful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the momentaryshudder out . " Parridine , " he said , " now that you 've got me , what did you do with Merit Hampton ? " " Merit Hampton ? " The lean face lost its smile . " Maybe you 'll discover when I get you back to our camp . " For minutes there was complete silence . Presently Parridine spoke again : " I observe the dust of Shelby 's Brigade out there on the desert . The Brigade does not appear to be moving very fast . I suspect that at present our friend Shelby is vastly uncomfort- able . He 'll be the more so when he discovers there 's no drinkablewater at the rancheria yonder  --  whose inhabitants , unfortunately , the Lipans have erased . This water supply on the mesa we find it necessary to keep  --  for our own use  --  and since only we know of it , it can continue its usefulness . " " I suppose there is no use even to hope that you might change your ideas about that . " " None . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 've eaten with them , and slept beside them . Those men you are condemningto die horribly in the desert . I would n't want that on my conscience . " " You 're more naive than I had thought , " the other said . " We do not intend that Shelby shall learn of this water  --  not by any stretch of the imagination . He 's chosen his own fate . If he 's led his men to their doom , let him watch them die  --  and die with them ! " The man sent to disarm Clay 's detail was slow because the sheer wall of caprock made it necessary for him to go a considerabledistance along the rim before finding a place to descend . Clay studied the face above him . It was , if anything , more bitter than when last he had seen it . " It seems El Gato has seen fit to give you responsibilities , " he said at last . " I am an officer , yes . El Capitan Parridine they call me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your duties with more honor than you discharged your friendly obligations to Shelby ! " Clay said bitterly . " Take care , " Parridine warned , " I might find it necessary to violate El Gato 's instructions to bring you to him alive ! " At last the Mexican from above had found a break in the rim-rock , down which he clambered , and was walking towardp293Clay , revolver in hand . In a few moments the scouts would be disarmed and helpless . And Shelby , out there in the desert , would never even know of it , for they were too far away to be seen . What a bitter ending to the danger and anguish the men had endured . Clay thought of Edwards , and gruff old Slayback , and handsome Reid Rutledge , and Moreland , and Shelby  --  the men and officers whom he knew almost as brothers  --  and the thought of what was going to happen out there on the mesquite flats , the agony of the magnificent Brigade , the madness , the ravings before night came , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face and his back remained superbly erect . His own men depended on him . Perhaps something might happen .. . " Why not the arroyo ? " It was Gonder 's voice , pitched low . Clay glanced down the ugly gash which opened at their feet . It was jagged with rocks , and choked at places with thickets of mesquite and black chaparral . Moreover , . it shot nearly straight down the steep declivity , then angled briefly , and finally pitched over a vicious slope that looked almost perpendicular . An impossible place to ride a horse , it appeared  --  and yet its ten-foot depth might be at least a partial protection from bullets . It was , Clay realized all at once , a way  --  a very dangerous way  --  but a possible way , if luck and great skill were with the riders . " It 's our only chance ! " Gonder whispered again . Clay took another look . His lips set . The Mexican had reached them and now he was extending his hand to take Clay 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gonder cut him across the face with his bridle rein , and at the instant , with a shout to his men , Clay struck spurs into his horse and bounded it over the steep bank into the arroyo , thundering ten feet downward to the bottom , and rolling the screaming Mexican over and over under the crushing hoofs.  | He had made the decision . There was a yell from above and the thudding of gun shots , but behind him , in a torrent of dust and stones and tossing manes and flying hoofs , came his men . In his four years as a cavalryman , Clay had done some riding , and had seen some riding done . But never anything like what took place in those next few minutes . Riding over rough ground is bad at any time . It becomes worse when the underfooting is the grooved , crooked bottom of a dry wash , and the situation is progressively complicated by jagged boulders , choking masses of thorny underbrush , and treacherous adobe-clay underfooting . When , finally , the way leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the circumstances make it necessary to travel as fast as your horse can hurl himself down the mountainside , riding becomes as dangerous an occupation as a reckless man could wish . In the first few moments after he jumped his horse down the ten-foot crumbling bank of the arroyo , carrying the Mexican to his death , Clay was so occupied with sticking in his saddle , trying to guide his animal around the worst of the clutching thorn-bushes , avoiding the bigger boulders , and buck-jumping from one side to the other of the not inconsiderable little canyon , that he saw little of what was happening . A bullet whined past his ear , and spiteful spurts of dirt sprang out of the side of the gulch . There was a scream and a crash , and he snatched one glance over his shoulder . The third man from the rear of his pounding avalanche had gone down , his horse shot out from under him  --  and Clay blinked in horror as the two scouts behind the fallen rider , unable to stop , piled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with legs broken , hurtled clear over the blood-spouting heap . No use to try to help them . To escape and reach Shelby was the necessity . Clay led the way , and he showed his men thatp295day how a captain of Shelby 's should ride . Square shoulders and straight back , bending and swaying to the action of the straining beast under him , hands low , head high , as calm in all seeming as if he were not hurtling down a sixty-degree slope , whisking around desperate tangles of dagger thorns , leaping magnificently over barriers of cluttered boulders he went , and all to the accompaniment of bullets whining angrily about him . Crashing , slipping , bounding and gathering impetus until one misstep would have meant bloody ruin , his men followed his audacious lead . It was incredible how quickly the danger was past . One moment they were under Parridine 's guns . Almost the next they were beyond his reach  --  so much so that the firing ceased above and Clay began easing down his mount . He wondered what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as , lifting his horse over a final rocky barricade , he led his men out on the flattening plain . Time now to draw breath and glance back up the mountain . It seemed impossible that they had come down that way  --  the twisting , shooting , rock-filled gash in the mountain-side looked almost too difficult for wild goats , let alone horses at a dead run . High on the shoulder where the trail ran , Clay saw the tiny figures of Parridine and his Mexicans , like beads on a string . . . Shelby was approaching the ruined rancheria  --  he had progressedfaster than Clay expected . By the time the scouts covered the distance between the mesa and the shattered adobes , the head of the column already was at the well . Even from a distance , as he approached it , Clay saw how the soul of the Brigade had been broken . As his little troop coasted down the column , men looked at it without recognition , the spirit gone from their eyes . Some seemed on the verge of collapsing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert straggled the noncombatant vehicles , some of them apparently halted.  | Word had just been passed down the line that here , too , the water was not to be obtained . For leagues the troopers and civiliansalike had kept their courage alive with the hope that after a time they might quench their thirst . The ghastly news they had just received destroyed the very manhood of some men . They were done  --  ready to quit . Then Clay saw Shelby . The general had finished inspecting the well , not knowing what his advance column under Clay had found on the mesa , and now he turned to his men . He lifted his voice , and the greatness in him came forth . Above disaster , above incredible misfortune , above certainty of death he rose ; and his voice , filled with confidence and calm , carried his courage to the command . Officers straightened in their saddles at that voice , and troopers came out of their collapse . Even the civilians took new grip on themselves . The word was " Forward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were thirty-five miles of waterless devastation to cover , with death beating down on the skull from the mercilesssun . Thirty-five miles impossible to traverse . Thirty-five miles that Shelby was asking of them  --  asking it with a face lit with the splendor of power and undying bravery . The lines in the weary faces tightened . Back to the bearded countenances came the look of final , settled determination . Please God , Shelby 's Brigade would make this last supreme effort for Old Jo . Clay 's detail was seen . A rider detached himself from the group of officers at the head of the column and came to meet them . Reid Rutledge  --  his handsome face not debonaire now , but haggard . He heard Clay incredulously , and in a few minutes Shelby was listening with a great joy in his face . He had thought his Brigade beyond any redemption . Clay and his scouts had given it a new life.  |p297SUN  and sand , sun and wind , sun and rock and thorn . They were deep in Coahuila now , jaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an open oven . Clay rode slack in the saddle , his being hugging every drop of moisture that was left within it , and kept an eye on his men , for they were far out in front of the column , and , because of their exhaustion from the pitiless blaze of the sun , he must guard doubly against any laxity among them . His gaze toward his sun-smitten riders had in it a vestige of pride and something like  --  affection . The crucible of the skirmish in the canyon and the test on the mesa had caused a metamorphosisin the scouts . They were different men from the slack handful Shelby first had given him . There was now no question as to loyalties or leadership . Rufe Champion , discredited greatly by his one exhibition of poltroonery , now rode at the rear of the column , saying little . But even he looked with an alert and respectful eye toward the captain who rode at their head . Four of the " Irregular Texans " were gone  --  one killed in the canyon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hound look had disappeared from the remaining twelve . They had been tried , and had shown courage and endurance in duty . To a degreethey had become the heroes of the Brigade , and Shelbyp298himself had seen fit to praise them . So these days they rode with a swagger , hats cocked low and a little to one side , backs straight , eyes level . Since the skirmish in the canyon the Brigade had altered its order of march . The scouts now rode well out ahead of the advance of the main column . Clay could see the dust of the line extending clear back to the rearward horizon . On this day they did not have hanging over them a worry as to their next water supply , such as had previously oppressed them on several long marches . There was a stream up ahead somewhere , and running water can not be tampered with successfully . By evenfall they had crossed seven hours of waterless desert , where the heat haze rose clear to the distant mountains . And at last they noticed that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and presently were descendinginto a canyon , where they found the little river they sought  --  a muddy desert stream , but unimpeachable water . " Take watch stations while the command makes camp , " Clay ordered , and his scouts , well-trained now , fanned out without further instructions , to post themselves on points of vantage from which the approach of any enemy could be marked . Presently Shelby 's men , haggard , beards tangled , and all a common dusty hue , streamed down into the valley . Horses , greedily sucking up water , lined the banks of the stream . The wagons and vehicles of the noncombatants came creaking in and took stations assigned . With orderly efficiency the horselineswere established , and tents rose , while hundreds scurried here and there to gather greasewood or mesquite for the eveningfires . Now was the time of relaxation for the scouts . As Shelby 's main body came in , Clay 's men were relieved of their outposts . They , of the strenuous all-day advance , were exempted from night sentry-go . Clay waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bivouac was established . Then , his duty done for the time being , he walked over to officers ' row . Major Edwards hailed him : " Bennett ! Wo n't you have supper with me ? I ca n't offer much . Hardtack a la Creole ? Salt beef a la Maryland ? Your imagination will have to furnish the sauce . " Clay squatted on the ground , glad for companionship . " How do you think we 're doing ? " he asked . " We 're making progress . That 's about as much as can be said now , " returned Edwards . " We 're way behind schedule . " " That 's correct . Days behind . Provisions running pretty low . But Shelby never starts out on anything he does n't finish . Sometimesit looks impossible , but he 's never yet failed to do what he set out to do . I think we 'll come out all right . " It was the simple credo of the little major . His idol could make no mistake , do no wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentally that their predicament was no fault of Shelby 's . Conditions had conspired against them . Where a single rider , or even a dozen riders , should by this time have reached the mountains , the desert still stretched immensely beforethe Brigade . And the situation was growing progressively more perilous . When they found good water they were forced to camp , in order to permit the gathering of whatever poor forage there was , including mesquite beans , to feed the horses . Halts to repair equipment grew more frequent , and this , as Clay had foreseen , was due more and more to the impractical vehicles of the noncombatants . Some sickness , due to the bad water , was beginning to appear , and grumbling grew louder in the ranks each day . Edwards read his mind . " If we only could be certain of our water supply , " he said , " we 'd move faster . But there 's no assurance . As you know we 've found wells and water pools poisoned too often now to trust the maps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are employing against us  --  and a damned effective one . If their object is to delay us while they gather their strength to meet us , they must be succeeding in it . I wonder if your friend Parridine might not be the brain behind it ? " " Parridine . . . ? Possibly . " " By the way , speaking of Parridine , what about that girl  --  Miss Hampton ? " " I do n't know ! " exclaimed Clay , with too much violence . " I speculated merely because I have a slight acquaintance with her father , " Edwards said mildly . Ill ask your pardon . " Clay was contrite . " I ca n't account for my rudeness , except that my responsibilities have been heavy , and I am worried . " But within him throbbed a dull and ceaseless hurt . He had seen Parridine , and after what the renegade had said his last doubt concerning Merit Hampton 's treachery was gone . It nauseatedhim to think that she would have allowed herself to be led away by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't jump at conclusions , " suggested the major , again with the appearance of reading his thoughts . " Conclusions ! " said Clay bitterly . Then his feelings got away with him . " From the first time I saw her , I thought she was a slut ! " " I still suggest that until final proofs are in hand judgment should be withheld . And even if the final proofs are convincing , there is perhaps some reason for self-congratulation . " " What do you mean ? " " I yield to none , Clay , in my admiration of the female sex . But after all , and without being too cynical , the ladies have their weaknesses . Inconstancy is one of them . But the reverse is sometimesjust as bad . It 's my experience that there 's nothing worsep30Ithan the fickleness of the women we want , except the infernal faithfulness of those we do n't want . Wait until you 've been dogged by some enduring female , my boy , before you go to thinking you 're miserable . Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir ! " Clay rose furiously . He stood for a moment , struggling with his own chaotic feelings . There was no sensible reason for his being worked up like this . He felt he was making a fool of himself . He half turned once more to crave the major 's pardon . And then furtherwords for the time being were stricken from his mouth . Out of the distant darkness where the stars shone in the velvet of the night sky , a rifle report came over the desert , and not thirty yards from where Clay stood confronting Edwards , a trooper pitched forward into his own campfire , his brains splashed out by an ounce slug of lead . Clay leaped , followed by the major , toward where the comradesof the stricken man were dragging him from the blaze . One soldier , with a piece of burlap , was beating out the fire that smoldered in the dead trooper 's clothing . They had turned him over . His face was a black and crusted sear , for he had pitched head-first into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life had been whipped out of him by the distant lead that almost tore off the top of his skull . Clay glanced about him . Red light from the blaze gave a tinge of horror to the faces of the men who had seen their companion die . Then hurrying footsteps came , and a harsh question . " It 's the general ! " someone said . Shelby stepped into the circle of illumination . As he did so the far rifle slammed again , and another bullet whined over their heads . " Douse those fires instantly ! " shouted the general . " Moreland , push your guards farther out and strengthen their number ! Here  --  some of you men there ! Pick this man up and carry him over to one of the wagons . Move ! " His voice galvanized the whole camp into fevered activity . Here and there figures hurried , using water or sand to quench every gleam of flame . Knowing the necessity of the precautions ordered , the troopers worked with quick efficiency . Even the civilians complied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ united support in his camp . Clay walked slowly back through the darkness of the fireless camp toward where Edwards ' tent stood . " Major , " he said uncomfortably , " concerning our recent words , I desire to express my utmost apologies  --  " " Nonsense , lad . I was at fault . I did not realize I was on ground so  --  delicate . The subject is closed . What do you think of this shooting ? " " If I were waging guerrilla warfare against a column such as this , I ca n't think of anything that would harass it more than just these very tactics , " said Clay wearily . As he spoke the distant rifle sounded again . Somewhere in the darkness the bulletstruck a rock and screamed away  --  an ugly sound , and disturbing . " It looks as if they had set in for the night , " said Edwards . " I guess we 'll have to grin and bear it  --  but I do n't like that shooting . " " Nor I , " agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shelby 's precautions the camp was much annoyed that night . Its general position had been located by the prowling enemy who continued to send over long-range shots at irregular intervals until dawn . Nobody was hit after the first casualty , but once a camp-kettle was punctured with a hollow bong , and in the whole night nobody slept very much . Shelby was grim in the morning . " Permit no straggling  --  nop303straggling whatever ! " he told his line officers . " We 're going to feel the enemy at last . At our present rate it will be another fortnightbefore we reach Monterrey , and every step of the way we 're likely to have snipers potting at us . Tell the men to do all their cooking by daylight . We 'll halt the day marches in time to permit them to do so . Fires are to be extinguished as soon as darkness falls every evening . " In four years of fighting the Yankees , Shelby 's Brigade had been harried by enemy outliers more than once . The blue cavalry of Steele @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red River . There had been some gentlemen from Coloradoin Pleasonton 's force of Northern Missouri , who did not lack assiduity . And the Kansas horse under Curtis displayed talent at inventing refinements in deviltry to keep the outposts busy . To all these the Brigade returned full measure in kind , with perhaps a slight margin of overpayment . But never a man in Shelby 's command had encountered a foe so wraith-like and malignant as was now with them every waking and sleeping hour . The night-shooting at the river camp was a beginning only , as the general predicted . By day Clay 's scouts beat up the country ahead , and flankers rode far out on the sides where possible . But the length of the column and the nature of the country both conspired to aid the enemy . This was the order of Shelby 's march these days , the dispositionsbeing of such nature as best to combat the lurking menace : First there rode a point  --  two men , one of them invariably either Janeicke or Tobias , Clay 's sergeants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party came , the body of scouts , riding in column of twos . Another interval , this time of two hundred and fifty yards , and the support , consisting of a full company , the various units of the Brigade taking this duty by rotation . After that a space of perhaps a thousand yards before Shelbyp304and the main body came , the men in column of fours now , and followed by the wagons and the crazy equipages of the civilians , the whole dragging out its length for a mile or more . Finally there was a rear guard company . Out on the flanks rode little Cossack patrols of four men each , scouting and nosing through the brush . From point to the last rear guard rider , the line of march stretched a full two miles . In spite of the utmost watchfulness the unseen enemy repeatedlytook toll in the following days , while the Brigade writhed and twisted through narrow arroyos and the first mountainbarrancas . Tiny puffs of white smoke would spout from a cliff , followed by the smack or whistle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men lay by dead fires , there would be distant splinters of orange flame , and more bullets . At first the Brigade was inclined to reply with carbine fire , but Shelby stopped that . It was a sheer waste of ammunition to blaze away into an empty landscape , which was all the troopers had to shoot at . At last one night , when a distant sharpshooter had practiced for an hour at long-range firing , and the whole camp sat tense , uncomfortable , and swearing in the darkness , wondering when one of those bullets would find a mark , Esau Janeicke slipped away by himself into the gloom . After a long time the camp heard the single , chopped-off sound of a Sharp 's rifle , and thereafterno more bullets arrived from the long-range marksman . Half an hour later the scout noiselessly reappeared in camp . " See anything ? " asked Gonder . " Yep , " said Esau . He probed in a pocket and handed something to his crony . From hand to hand it passed , bringing exclamationsfrom each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two curious , ridged pieces of flesh , sticky with blood . " Ears ! " he cried , aghast . But Shelby , who had just come up , Wp305asked for the trophies , and swore that there existed no scout in the world the equal of Esau Janeicke . The casualty list , in those days and nights , grew . After the first night-shooting when a soldier was killed , a sergeant in Langhorne 's company was hit by a carefully calculated longrangebullet in the succeeding camp , and Bledsoe , one of the line captains , had a chip taken out of the side of his left hand by a slug while riding in the line of march the following morning . That same afternoon two men of the rear guard , who had fallen behind in spite of the orders against straggling , were cut off by a sudden rush of Lipan Apaches who evidently were working in close co-operation with the Mexicans . The shrieks of the two men were heard , but the rescue party arrived too late . They were gone  --  vanished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under the stimulus of fear , managed to keep well up  --  although not without their inevitable complaints . Concerning them a new worry now oppressed Shelby . The excessivelyrough road , the steep acclivities and declivities , and especially the dryness of the air , combined to weaken and shatterthe wheels of many of the lighter vehicles . Axles broke , felloes snapped , and spokes splintered . Sometimes wagon tongues , even , were fairly twisted off in the struggles up the mountain paths . Once a supply wagon pitched right off the trail , carrying over its teams , and killing its driver . But it was the countless breakdowns in the motley array of equipages of the politicians which became the serious matter , because they were forever causing delays . Already the march was far behind its time-table . At first the overworked wagonmasterstried to repair the vehicles ; but while the work was being done on the collapsed wheel of the carriage of some glitteringpersonage , the whole Brigade , perforce , waited . And whenever such a breakdown occurred , the noncombatants wouldp3o6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweatingsoldiers ; and there pass judgment on the inefficiency of the army , complain of the lack of foresight which permitted all this to happen , and inveigh against the unkind fate that threw them in with a military expedition as wretchedly conducted  --  according to their verdict  --  as this of Shelby 's . All of which Shelby took with the most amazing patience , and it was only after many such delays , which cut the progress of the Brigade by half , that he reached a conclusion as inevitable as it was unpleasant . He issued an order that all vehicles should be abandoned , unless they could be repaired within a quarter of an hour . And that brought a really magnificent howl of objection from the outraged politicians . " What , seh , are we to do , who have been riding in the vehicles thus condemned ? " demanded the orotund voice of Congressman Tweedie . " If you can not find accommodations with your friends , " Shelby explained , " you will have to ride horseback  --  " " This is monstrous ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't we informed of this ? I submit , seh , that I , fo ' one , am physically unsuited fo ' the saddle . I am a man of weight , seh , not one of yo ' spindling cavalry bravoes . I get saddle-galls , seh , and fo ' a man built as I am , there is always danger of the onset of a hernia  --  " " I should not presume to dictate to a gentleman who is , I am informed , an ornament to the congressional delegation of his state , " said the long-suffering Shelby , " but I beg of you to consider , sir  --  we have wounded men who willingly ride in spite of their hurts . I ask you to do nothing more than these . " " But our rights , seh  --  " And then Shelby finally lost his patience . " Damn your rights , sir ! " he shouted in a voice that made the round congressman jump . And stamped snorting away.  |p307The  very next day the thing he had feared happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been threatening imminent collapse , finally disintegrated under him . The gentlemanfrom Louisiana sputtered for some minutes , but even to him it was apparent that the stove-in wheels were beyond repair . His necessary luggage was put into a wagon , and he resumed the journey on the back of a very slow and gentle quartermaster'shorse , his plump legs sticking nearly straight out , his hands gripping the saddle-bow , his face a picture of martyrdom . And before evening Congressman Tweedie had entered a new estate  --  the casualty list . It was an hour before halting for camp , when the far-distant , flat report of a rifle sounded , accompanied by a yell from Tweedie . He clapped a hand sharply to his round posterior as if a hornet had stung him there . " I 'm wounded ! I 'm wounded ! " he cried , his voice given added volume by his anguish . " Great God , I 'm bleeding ! " There was a halt while horse-faced , club-jointed Dr. John Tisdale , the Brigade surgeon , went hurrying back from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congressman was indubitably wounded  --  a very slight scratch on the outside of his left buttock  --  nothing serious , but amply sufficient to affordTweedie , if he desired it , additional cause for self-pity and complaint . But a miracle happened . The congressman 's mood suddenly altered . Instead of insisting upon being hauled in a wagon , he mounted his horse again , and completed the day 's march . By the time they halted at night , the wound was sore and he requiredassistance to dismount . But even then he bore himself right manfully . This behavior astonished Shelby and everyone else , but there was a reason for it . Congressman Tweedie had seen his own blood . It occurred to him that he was a hero . In his life he had envisaged himself as many things , but never as a hero . The thought proved new and unexpectedly pleasant . He waved aside expressions of sympathy , but even as he did it , he savored them and found them satisfying . Thereafter the fat legislator began to talk with pride of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it in a carefully casual way as " my injury . " When they camped at night , he cornered Dr. Tisdale and conversedat length with that long-suffering man of science . Immediatelyafterward he blossomed out as an authority on gunshot wounds , and torn wounds , and wounds that were fouled and in danger of infection . As for his fellow civilians , he grew quite patronizing to them . " Afteh yo ' have been wounded , yo ' know , some of these petty annoyances do n't seem so impawtant , " he would say loftily . Or : " There 's nothing like a gunshot wound to give yo ' a sense of propawtion . " This was gall and wormwood to his colleagues . But though he howled whenever he sat down , and particularly when three strong men united in hoisting him to his saddle  --  a fourth holding his horse  --  he became infinitely less of a nuisance than before he was wounded . In a word , having become a hero CongressmanTweedie ceased to be an obstacle . He acquired a fellow-feeling for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and nobody obeyed more cheerfully than he the commandsof the general . That chance shot from the Mexican sharpshooter 's gun proved an unexpected boon to the Brigade and to Shelby . Day succeeded weary day in the treacherous desert . By the end of that week the men were savage from loss of sleep , the heat , and the knowledge that they were being constantly stalked by enemies against whom they could not retaliate . Fortunately they had reached an area where there were a few running streams , and the ever-present fear of water pollution was banishedfor the present at least.  |p309But  there was a new kind of trouble . An epidemic of dysenterybroke out  --  so severe that sometimes twenty or thirty men at a time would be twisting and moaning in agony , in the wagons which had been emptied and converted into makeshift ambulances . Aided by one or two soldiers he had selected as hospital orderlies , Dr. Tisdale did what he could , but hardly a day 's march ended now , without the digging of graves and the reading of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edwards , from a worn prayer book which he carried for the purpose in his saddle-bags . In those days Shelby was the driving force that kept the Brigade moving forward . He joked , cursed , threatened , promised , or appealed as the occasion warranted . Usually , however , the general 's mere presence was enough to make his weary , gaunt troopers sit a little straighter in their saddles and call upon a little more of their reserves . Doggedly the Brigade wound its tortured way through thorny tangle and rocky defile , with death prowling about it ; and presently to the other problems on Shelby 's tired shoulders was added the Iong-expected shortage of food . In spite of every superhuman effort , the rate of march had been much slower than he had calculated . The time was at hand when the men would have to go on part rations . But on the credit side of the ledger was the fact that the Brigade presently began to adapt itself to the new country and the nature of the foe , and to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janeicke had set the example the night he went out and " collected " the ears of the sniping Lipan . After that Clay began the practice of sending out his scouts in pairs after dark when the pot-shooting began in the hills . They found that this night sniping was largely the work of the Lipan Apaches , and it surprised and delighted him to see the way his " Irregular Texans " took to this work . Very quickly results were obtained.  |p310Of  course Janeicke was without a peer in this sort of thing . But , after the " Irregulars , " the big surprise was Gonder . Consideringhis weight , the red-beard showed an amazing ability at stealth , and he developed a fondness for lying in the head of some arroyo a quarter of a mile or so from camp on the darkest nights , awaiting the prowl of a cat-footed foe . Then he would rise up softly on his elbow with his rifle , and the Lipan tribe of Apaches would have one more cause for caterwauling at the time of mourning for departed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Champion , the gangling Texan who had been discredited as leader of the " irregulars "  --  became adept at counter-sniping , and Clay himself was the inventor of a stratagem that worked with surprisinglygratifying results . One night he caused three fires to be kindled some distance from the Brigade camping place , allowing them to burn low so that their coals only glimmered in the ashes . When the Indians crept up on these dying embers under the misapprehensionthat about them men were sleeping , Clay 's scouts , posted above on a low ridge of country rock , dropped a couple of salutaryvolleys among them  --  although , because they carried away their wounded and dead , the exact losses of the Indians were never ascertained.  |p311FOR  that ambushment the scouts received official commendation for the second time , although as before Shelby pointedly refrainedfrom saying anything of a personal nature to Clay . Shelby was a man who did not forgive easily , a fact which Clay had known , but which he was finding out with greater force at present . For two whole days after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that brought the march up to a wide river valley , which indicated a considerable stream ahead to be forded . But a large river also meant grass  --  and Shelby 's horses were in pitiable state from lack of forage . Not an animal among them but showed every rib in its body . Nor were their riders in better case , for the rations had been cut , and cut again . More and more frequently they came upon the sinister little murder crosses , standing here and there by the wayside , showingthat this country , if barren , also was bloody . Commerce was dead , and the black scars of war were branded deeply in the rough hills , where every village stood ruined . Such adobe huts as had escaped destruction were empty when the column arrived in their vicinity  --  the rotos , ragged ones , who had inhabitedthem fled at the first glimpse of Shelby 's advance party ,  |p312and  lurked deep in the mesquite and sagebrush , ready instantly to burrow still more deeply into hideaways which they alone knew in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were as dangerous as the Lipans and guerrillas , for they had suffered cruelly at the hands of both French and Juaristas , and took savage reprisals whenever chance put a victimin their hands . Wherefore it was more than ever necessary to keep the column closed up , and orders went down the line to that effect . The morning that the Brigade reached the river valley , it passed through a half-ruined village . The column swung along the main thoroughfare , but Clay , with some of his scouts , turned aside to investigate . At first they saw no living soul . Then they turned a corner , and there sitting was a woman , her reboso pulled over her face , a patient pyramid of sorrow . Above her head hung a horror . Four men dangled , suspended from the door facings of one of the shattered buildings  --  flayed while living . Like tattered garments , strips of skin hung from them . Their dead faces were twisted in such grimaces of frozen agony that at first Clay did not understand what it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a staring half-circle . Then he knew . The two grinning dead in the center were their comrades  --  the two stragglers from Shelby 's column who had been captured a few days before . The others were Mexicans . Nailed to the dead flesh of each of the Mexicans was a sign in Spanish : TRAIDOR . The woman on the ground slowly lifted the reboso from her face . In all his life Clay had never seen such stunned anguish as was in those features . She was young , but her grief gave her the appearance of age . And this in spite of the fact that there was not a tear in her eyes . " Take down those bodies and bury theirs , " Clay ordered.  | " Gonder , see what you can find out from this woman . " While the other men struggled to lift down , one after another , the stiff , bloody dead , the red-beard dismounted and addressed her in slow , gentle Spanish . She replied . " El Gato is hereabouts , " Gonder said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She says he 's got plenty soldados with him . " " That 's something Shelby must know as soon as possible , " said Clay . " This thing here , " Gonder went on , indicating the bloody human ruins , now lying awkwardly on the ground beside the trench the scouts were digging , " she says it was the Lipans done it . The two Mexicans was men of this very village . This pore gal asse'ts that they was good Juaristas , only they did n't have no hankerin 's to jine the army . Them other two  --  as you already know  --  was pris'ners . An ' heah 's the thing that sticks , seh . She claims it was El Gringo that turned them four pris'ners over to the Injuns . " " El Gringo ? That 's what Parridine calls himself ! " exclaimed Clay . " Yep . " " Just a minute . It 's just a little hard to believe that a white man would order anything like what we 've seen . " Again the red-beard questioned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't awdeh the torture . He jest turned them over to the Lipans . But it amounted to the same thing . The Mexicans , she says , cried an ' begged , but them two boys of ourn , they did n't know what was goin ' to happen to them .. . ontil it started happenin ' . Mebbe Parridine did n't neither . He rode away befo ' the Apaches went to work on them four , she says . One of ' em was this woman 's own husband . She could n't see what was happenin  --  had to keep hid out . But she says she could hear the Injuns jabberin ' an ' laughin ' , an ' one after an/other she could hear the pris'ners hollerin ' . Her husband 's voice  --  she recognized it , seh . It fair makes you sick to listen to her tell it . He was the second one they worked on . The Americans was last . She says the fust Mexican lived longest . She could hear his voice , still hollerin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Release her , " was all Clay could say . The burying detail , sick with the horror of what they had seen , tossed the last stones on the filled trench . He ordered them to horse , and led them in a canter to overtake Shelby . They rode along the long dusty column of vehicles and riders , until they reached the general , who had halted beyond the village at the edge of the plateau where it shelved down steeply into the gray-green mesquite and cactus of the valley . Intently Shelby listened to Clay 's report . " So this El Gringo rode away before the Indians began to torment the prisoners , " he commented . " I suppose that was too much for his delicate sensibilities . " " Do you believe , sir , that a man like Parridine  --  an Americanand an officer -- could be guilty of permitting a thing like this to happen if he knew it ? " came a surprised interjection from Colonel Slayback who sat his horse beside Shelby 's . " Unhappily I do , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parridine capable of doing anything . He seems to have some kind of a grievance against the world , and he will go to all lengths . It is a fact , somber but true , that Parridine has prototypes in history . There have been renegades of his breed before . The people of Kentucky will never forget that Simon Girty turned white prisoners over to the Wyandottes , and the people of New York will always remember that Walter Butler watched the Iroquois burning Americans at the stake . In my opinion , we 're dealing here with a human hyena . He allowsbrutality , because it builds him up with his Mexicans and Indians , in whom cruelty is abysmal . There 's a lesson in thisp315episode for all of us . We know now what will happen to us if we 're ever captured . Gentlemen , it must n't happen . " His officers listened in silence , some glancing at each other , and moistening their lips with their tongues . : Bennett , " Shelby said briskly , as if eager to leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us . It has only one ford at this point , according to my information . If I were in the shoes of this El Gato , I 'd have my men posted somewhere about that ford . I want you to take your detachment and feel out that ford ahead . " " Yes , sir ! " said Clay , saluting , glad to be on the move . With his scouts behind him , he went down the trail at a trot . Across the dusty plain wriggled the river , its course marked by a thick verdant screen of trees and bushes , wonderfully grateful to the eyes after the dry wilderness . From a long way off Clay heard the roar of the foam-streaked current , and as they rode down to the water 's edge , the stream looked ominous . It seemed a hundred yards across here , although it really was less than that ; and for most of its visible course it ran very deep and strong , with sleek eddies and occasional spoutings of foam where water surged over some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to it , however , the river was wider and shallower , its surface broken by great rocks , about which the water swirled in waves and leaping spume . Downstreamit pitched suddenly over a shelf of stone , and the thunderof the falls boomed like a vast gong on the hot , stagnant air . It was an ugly , dangerous ford , and not only Clay , but every man with him , studied anxiously the thick woods beyond . " Hendy , take three men and scout up the river bank half a mile or so , keeping an eye on the other shore for indications of the enemy , " the captain ordered . " Esau , do the same down- stream . Move smart , now , and bring back your reports quick as possible . " During the time the side parties were gone , he strained his eyes for the flicker of a movement in the greenery beyond . But the woods were silent , and save for the shimmer of the distantfoliage in the slight breeze , there was no motion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down below is mean an ' high , seh , " he reported . " Thar ai n't no reason to be defendin ' it , because nobuddy could git acrost nohow . " " Any sign of horses on the other bank ? " " No , seh . Not a thing . " " Very good , " said Clay . Tobias was in view , and when he made his report it was no more illuminating than Janeicke 's . Again Clay asked : " See any horses ? " Again the reply was negative . Horses would be the most difficultthing to hide if a considerable body of men lay across the stream . Any force large enough to threaten seriously Shelby would have a thousand or more horses to screen . It might be that no foe was over there after all . But the order was to feel out the ford . Only one thing remainedfor Clay to do . He had to cross the river . At this point , the current of the stream was stiff , but the ford was practicable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boulders in the channel had been pushed aside , so that there was a wide watery avenue over which wagons or coaches might cross without splintering their wheels . Clay turned to his men . " Have a good look at your weapons , " he told them . " We 've got to go over that ford . Probably there 's nothing over there . But we 're going to find out . Keep your eyes on me , and scatter out when we start . If I see a single sombrero in those woods ,  |p317I  'm falling back , because one rifle will likely mean hundreds . " His eyes searched the faces about him . On Janeicke , Tobias , Gonder , and Caruthers , he knew he could count . But these others  --  the " Irregular Texans "  --  this was a final test for them . Would they hang back ? What he saw in the faces did not displease him . He turned his horse and splashed into the ford with a new kind of feelingtoward these men . A kind of affection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today they were  --  soldiers . That was his doing . lie had put confidence and a new manhood into them . He felt almost tender toward them , because they were his . Therefore his voice was unwontedly gruff when he spoke : " Let 's get at it ! " With a sensation very like plunging into an icy shower , he spurred into the river . The horse took daintily to the water , seeming to dislike wetting his hoofs . On either side , Janeicke and Gonder took their distances , and the others deployed in a scattering skirmish line . Clay 's chest tightened a little at the sight of that blank , threatening wall of green , but the alert faces behind him showed no lack of confidence . Guiding with his knees , a long-barreled revolver in his right hand , he splashed forward . The rushing water rose until the current ripped at the girths and his boots were wet . Still no sign from the other shore . Now his horse began to brace against the current , and fight his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stream lay behind them  --  a half . Two-thirds . Clay began to breathe more freely . Then events happened with deadly speed . Behind the jungle verdure a rifle cracked and a spout of white foam leaped besideJaneicke . Another shot . The nervous chatter of a small volley . Upstream one of the Texans clutched convulsively at his horse 's mane , gave a weak , fading wail , and pitched into the water . They never saw him again ; the falls took him . " Forward ! Gallop ! " Clay yelled , with sudden frantic realization that their only chance was ahead . They had come too far to retreat . Their only hope was under the bank of the river . Obediently , the scouts drove through the water in a foaming rush . All at once the bottom shelved . Clay 's horse was reaching for the bar at the bank . Dry sand was just ahead . And then the whole blank expanse of woods in front put forth curtains of gray powder smoke , and there came the long , spattering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churned by bullets . Clay 's horse stumbled and went full length over . Blackness closed over Clay . About him swirled cold wetness and a strangling pain shot through his lungs . A vast avalanche of noise beat against his ears and dinned inside his skull . Light seeped between his eyelidsand he knew powerful hands had gripped him beneath the armpits . Then the strangling passed and Clay was vomiting as he gulped for air . Continuously , agonizingly , he coughed , retching after the paroxysms . All around was the splash and burble of water , but he was being dragged forward . Then dry , hot sand was under him , and consciousness beat back slowly to tell him that rifles were at work about him , and that the tumult of musketry came from the woods which now seemed almost on top of him . Clay opened his eyes . His lungs were easier now . " Lay still , seh , " said a voice . " If you stick your haid above that bank , they 'll shoot it plumb off . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , wet to the armpits , and Janeicke half-sprawled a yard or so away.  | " Wh-what happened ? " Clay asked feebly . " Your hoss was shot an ' threw you . Your haid hit on a rock an ' it discombobulated you . Esau ketched a toe of your boot , or you 'd of gone over them falls . Then we both got you by the body an ' dragged you here . " Dizzily Clay looked about . He lay under a low , perpendicularclay bank on a flat sandy shingle , with the river washing by almost under his elbow . The bank was no more than three feet high , and against it , their muddy bodies pressed to the earth as if for protection , were his men . He counted . Six . And he had started across with sixteen .. . " Where are the rest ? " he asked , still shaken . " Gone , " grunted Janeicke . " Dead ? " " Yep . Falls got ' em . " " Catfish ? " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry . The horses ? " " Kilt or turned loosed when we got to this bank . " Rifles were slamming in the woods and Clay listened , estimatingthe volume . " Sounds like a thousand guns , " he said . " More like two thousand , " replied Gonder . " They ai n't all shootin ' now . Wish Shelby 'd come . " " He 'll be a-comin ' , " promised Esau . Gonder laughed mirthlessly . " Silly of us , wishin ' Shelby 'd come , ai n't it ? " he asked . " Because even if he does , it ai n't goin ' to do us no good . Shelby or the devil ca n't cross that river in the teeth of them guns . We better hope fo ' night , instead . " " It 's plain ye do n't know Ole Jo , " returned Esau severely . " Ole Jo will git us out of hyar . He 's a son-of-a-bitch on wheels ! " Clay 's head was clearing , although it ached horribly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his skull and felt a bruise puffing up . Without realizing that the movement brought the top of his head above the bank , he struggled to a sitting position . Instantly his hat was smitten from him . " Close shootin ' , " commented Esau critically , as Clay ducked . Twenty feet away , one of the Texans fell thrashing on the mucky bar , biting at nothing and quickly convulsing in death . " Five left , " said Gonder as if he were discussing the weather . " How you feelin ' now , seh ? " He sat hunched behind the bank with all that racket going on in the woods not fifty yards from him , and the slugs biting the edge of the earth above his head , and calmly stroked his red beard while he gazed at Clay with friendly concern . Compared with his colossal calm even the veteran Janeicke appeared nervous . " Better , thanks , " said Clay . " Esau , order everyone to keep down , except one man at a time as a lookout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those woods . " He now recognized those still alive under the bank . In addition to Gonder , Janeicke and himself , they were Hendy Tobias and the cadaverous Texan , Rufe Champion . Hendy removed his hat , and the sun beat hot on his bleached eyebrows and thin sandy beard as he raised his head cautiously and snatched a glance over the rampart . " See nawthin ' , seh , " he said , ducking as a storm of bullets combed the top of the bank . " Listen to them devils shoot ! " " Hold your hail jest right an ' they 'll part your hair fo ' you , " suggested Gonder , and even in their peril the besieged men under the bank laughed . " Dare yo ' to let ' em part them orange colored whiskers of yourn , " retorted Hendy . Inch by inch , his hands flattened like a lizard 's against the bank , he raised up for another look . Something made a woody , rapping sound , and the sergeant pitched over sidewise , with ap321feeble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Gonder , not bothering to turn Tobias over . " Want me to look , seh ? " " Keep down ! " Clay exclaimed . " Listen ! " It had been long coming , but they all heard it  --  the distant thin note of a bugle . " Shelby , " said Gonder . " Wonder what he aims to do ? He 's done lost sixteen men an ' a off'cer already . This crossing is goin ' to cost him plenty . " With utmost detachment the red-beard was counting them all as already dead . " Set still an ' git a lesson , " said Esau . " Ye ai n't never seen Jo Shelby make a cavalry crossin ' . It 's jest bee-youtiful to watch . " He rubbed his hands together and grinned through the black mat of his whiskers . " I tell ye , he 's a son-of-a-bitch on wheels ! " Close together crouched Janeicke , Gonder and Clay . A dozen paces away , excluded by a sort of timidity from their close company , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazing broodingly at the river . " Cheer up , Rufe , " said Janeicke . " Think how lucky ye are that than ai n't no yalligators in them waters . " " Ah ai n't lucky , " Champion turned his lean face toward them and his eyes were haggard . " Ah 'm jest thinkin ' how onluckyAh am . They 're gone  --  all of ' em . Ah knew them boys . We rode together fo ' years . We got drunk together . Mos ' folks was too good fo ' us , but them boys was all jest alike . We  --  we was purty no-'count , Ah guess . But we all done things alike , an ' it was all right . A man kin go ' long when he 's got a friend that knows him right down to his heart . But mine is all gone . Gone fo ' good . Ah 'm the only one left . Lovely Jesus , Ah ai n't lucky ! " At the pain in his voice even Gonder was silent . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw across the river the gray troopers . They were coming hard , to aid the flankers in the wood  --  the first ranks of the cavalry rode over the bank into the water and the foam boiled white under their horses ' hoofs . Bullets kicked among them and here and there a saddle was emptied or a horse went down . But on they came with a rush . " Did n't I tell ye Ole Jo was a son-of-a-bitch on wheels ? " crowed Esau in triumph to Gonder . And then the first rush of the horsemen was across the river . An officer  --  Reid Rutledge  --  gave Clay a hand and a stirrup , and he vaulted up behind the rider . They plunged into the heavy tangle of green and their horse leaped over something , then half-stumbled on something else  --  something soft . Beneath them a high , splintered scream arrowed upward . Branches whipped Clay 's face . A bullet sang past his ear . Hoofs pounded , orders were bawled , and the noise of the guns was everywhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush had carried it through the woods . Men had leaped from their horses and were kneeling , shooting at bobbing figures of distant runningMexicans , who were making for the barren mesquite hills beyond.  |p325SHELBY  said : " It 's rye , but it was all I could get in San Antonio . In the absence of bourbon , drink up , captain . " Captain John Thrailkill relaxed his stiffness , glanced at Major Edwards who sat with the general in the lantern-illuminatedtent , and reached for the tin cup . Before he raised it to his lips , he spat copiously out of the tent door . Then , without bothering to wipe the trickle of dark slime which ran down his chin from the corner of his mouth and made a crooked rivulet before it lost itself in the forest of black beard on his jaw , he shifted the quid to the corner of his cheek and gulped down the fiery liquor . Thrailkill was the only man Shelby knew who could chew tobacco and drink whiskey at the same time . It was said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A farmer , with no pretensions to education , but a first-class soldier . His previous experience as one of Quantrill 's guerrillas had not hurt him as a cavalryman under Shelby . But then , he had left Quantrill before the latter became such a stench in the nostrils . Through the distance a far-away scream bored , containing an accumulation of human agony to set a man 's teeth on edge , but Thrailkill did not blink . He set down the empty cup , stiffened , and began his report :  | " Near as we can figger , there 's seventy-nine daid Mexicans an ' Lipans . All the wounded must 've escaped , seh  --  or the shootin ' of our men was re-markable acc'rate . " He let the last words linger with inescapable implications . Shelby grunted testily . " Ca n't expect my men to act like angels in battle after the misery they 've been undergoing , " he growled . Another voice , afar , lifted its agonized plaint . Shelby stirred uncomfortably . He knew the hospital tent was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile downstream , and that in it Dr. Tisdale was making a horror and a shambles . There the screaminghad begun soon after the battle ended , and the shattered bodies on the table leaped and fought , held down by stonyfacedmen , as the doctor cut , or probed , or sometimes sawed . Even now , after darkness , Tisdale worked desperately on by lantern light , dealing with red gaping abominations , and inexorablydeaf to the voices of the wounded , who prayed for mercy when the only mercy was mercilessness . " Wish to God Tisdale would finish his butchering , " Shelby groaned . Thrailkill shifted his quid again . " Thar was five pris'ners , seh . " " Prisoners ! " Shelby rapped out . " Good ! Have them brought up . Now by the gullet of God , I 'll shoot them if it 's the last thing I do  --  after what they did back in that village to my men ! " An orderly went hurrying at Edwards ' command , and Shelby turned once more to the captain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thrailkill ? " " Fo'ty daid , seh , includin ' them in Bennett 's detachment . " Thrailkill spoke without emotion . " An ' about the same number wounded . The high propo'tion of fatalities is due to the fact that durin ' the crossin ' of the river , the men shot off'n their hosses , even if only slightly wounded , was mostly carried overp327the falls an ' drowned . " " The wounded  --  how many has Tisdale got that ca n't ride ? " " He done a number of amp'tations  --  mebbe ten  --  last time I checked , " replied Trailkill . " Christ ! The hospital 's the worst thing about an army . It 's hell  --  just plain hell . " Shelby sighed . Then he added an ingenuoussentence : " It 's the one thing I do n't like about a battle . " For a moment he thought . " Ten  --  or twenty  --  amputations are going to complicate matters . These men have to be transported . That means wagons  --  and getting wagons the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sockdolager of a problem . Well , Thrailkill , that 's all . Get some sleep . " He returned the captain 's salute , which could never be anything but awkward , and as Thrailkill departed , faced Edwards . " That 's not bad  --  do you think , John ? " Shelby asked the major . " Considering the difficulties  --  river to cross and all ? Cheap , really , any way you look at it . Fine work by Bennett 's scouts  --  the way they developed the enemy and then held their positions on the bank . Permitted me to send Collins to swim the river above the ford and envelop the enemy by the flank . We rolled ' em up like a wet towel , did n't we ? " He was talking fast . Talking too fast . Talking to hear himselftalk . Edwards had been with the general before when he drank whiskey and talked fast . That was in the early days of the war . It is hell to be a commanding officer when the wounded worry you . Funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter much . But the wounded  --  you 're responsible , somehow , for the way they are shattered . And the way they suffer . Liquor is the one cure for the feeling . It does n't make you forget , but it makes your ideas fuzzy and not sharp at the edges . It was going to take considerable liquor for Shelby this evening . Curious , too . He thought he had got all over this squeamishnessabout his battle wounded . At the end of the war he had secretly been quite proud of his ability to walk through a hospitalwithout a stomach flutter . And here , all of a sudden , it was back again as bad as ever . A reason for it , of course . Shelby knew what was the matter . He could not fall back now for moral reinforcement on the thought that he sent these men to receive their wounds under orders of someone higher than he . He was solely responsible now . He had brought these men to Mexico , and there was no higher authority . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Orders for battle , orders for death , came from him , Jo Shelby . Him alone . His brain created the movements which resulted in those distant screams . He hoped Edwards would not see through his consciously assumed pose of indifference . Shelby groped again for the bottle . He had been drinking now for two hours . So far his superb head for liquor refused to succumb , but the fumes were beginning to get in their work at last . Edwards gazed at him uncomfortably . He had seen Jo Shelby take to drink before , but it never failed to worry him . Thrailkill had said five prisoners , and Shelby , remembering the flayed corpses back among the ruins , awaited the coming of the five . He wanted to talk with them while he could still think coherently . Gonder , huge and red-bearded , appeared at the door of the tent and saluted . " You send fo ' me , seh ? " " Yes , Gonder . I want you to do some interpreting . Stand aside there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a little knot of sullen , expressionless men , in dirty rags . Shelby looked at them , then leaned suddenly forward and stared at the last pair . Was n't that Senor Anda ? And Father Bartolome , of Piedras Negras ! No mistaking them . Somewhat dustier , perhaps , but no leaner or less composed , the old priest had changed little from whenp329Shelby last saw him . The fat little alcalde , however , looked worn and almost pathetic . " Anda ! " said Shelby . " What are you doing here ? " " I am soldado , " replied the alcalde . " Soldado hell ! You 're not soldiers  --  you are savages ! Ban-. dits , and murderers , and torturers of helpless prisoners ! Yes , we found them back in the village  --  those men you left for us . With the hide torn off their bodies . I 'm sorry I find you in this company , Anda , because I 've sworn to shoot every guerrilla I lay my hands on ! " The little alcalde listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Shelby finished , he drew his short figure erect . " You say we mus ' die , mi general , " he said . " ' Sta bueno ! We die . Thees hombres  --  they know they weel die . I know it . But also , an ' moreover , ees one thing more mus ' be said  --  to you I weel say eet . You call us bandidos . Ees not true ! We are soldados of the republica ! An ' we say , all of us , to you  --  Viva la reptiblica ! " The last words raised to a defiant shout . Momentarily the dull faces of the other prisoners lit . Senor Anda turned again to Shelby . " Leesten , mi general , " he said . " In Mexico we do not ask los gringos to come to us . We hall no hate for Americanos , Franceses , Austrianos . We go not in your countree , rob , kill , make slave . We live in peace . I suggest . Ees thees not well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the little man paused , but Shelby remained grimly silent . " But los gringos  --  they weel not leaf us alone ! " Anda spoke more like a prosecuting attorney than one speaking in his own defense . " Here ees Mexico , they say . She ees weak . Ha ! They swoop down  --  like the zipolotes from the sky . Thees part , she ees for me ! ' one cries . Mira ! That part , she ees mine , ' cries anozzer . They tear my so onhappee countree to pieces  --  they feed on eet . Ees not so ? " Senor Anda 's short , round frame had taken on strange dignity . " You , mi general , in Los Estados Unidos , are a famous soldado yourself . Thees I well know . You fight for freedom , yes ? When I see you , I say , ' Thees man , he ees good . Ees brave . He love freedom . I weel haff heem for amigo . " But somet'ing happen . The Americanos , they leesten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask . Ees rich ? No . Ees strong ? No . Ees nozzing but poor damn-fool Indio , hunted weethout any countree . The Americanos say , thees Juarez , thees Anda  --  they are rotos , the ragged ones . We go to Maximiliano von Hapsburg  --  ees rico , the rich one . He weel reward us . To hell weeth thees Mexicanos ! " Edwards glanced nervously at Shelby 's face . It was fixed and hard under the tirade . But Anda went on with his indict-ment : " You who eat in my casa , you who are my guest  --  you say , we weel sell our arms to those rich Maximiliano ! " But me  --  what shall I do ? Weel I sell my soul to los Franceses ? Weel I geev up my countree ? Why not ? I am leetle . I am fat . I can not swing the saber like the great Shell-by . I haff not beeg brigada of so-fierce soldados . Why I no sell myself also an ' moreover ? " The little alcalde 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mi general ! Ees because I am a man ! Ees because I do not lie . I love freedom  --  love too mooch to sell . Those poor Juarez , hiding in the desert  --  he is a man also . I suggest . Ees flesh an ' blood , si . But ees not afraid to die for hees countree ! He weel not sell . Ees more better man than you , El General Shell-by ! An ' so ees it weeth me ! " Edwards , Gonder , Captain Rutledge of the guard detail , andp331the guards in charge of the prisoners , stared breathless at Shelby . Never in their military lives had they heard him so rated . They looked for a volcanic explosion , almost bracing themselves for its violence . But Shelby made no reply to Senor Anda . Almost hypnoticallyhis eyes remained fixed on the little Mexican , as he sat silent , a strange expression on his face . After what seemed a long time , he turned to Rutledge . " Take the prisoners back , and guard them well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I said guard them  --  not shoot them . " Shelby 's voice did not rise . It seemed calm , almost tired . Long after the guard marched away with the prisoners , the general sat staring . Edwards remained silent , not daring to break the stillness . " John , " said Shelby after many minutes . " Yes , general . " " That fat little man was telling the truth . " " Oh , now , general  --  " " The truth , John ! It is a true bill Senor Anda has returned . " Edwards remained silent . Shelby spoke again . " John ? " " Yes , general . " " How do you feel ? " " I think , sir , that I 'm beginning to get sober . " " I too ! A most sorry condition , John . " Shelby offered the bottle . Edwards reached for it . The red tip of his tongue came out to moisten his dry lips . " Well  --  your excellent health , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquor coursed with grateful warmth down his throat . Edwards could see the rise and fall of the general 's adam 's apple , and the sour odor of whiskey spread about them.  | Shelby leaned forward with the bottle , his face still unsmiling . " H'ist another , " he said . Eagerly Edwards seized it , poured a drink in his cup , and handed it back to the general . This time Shelby did not bother with a cup . He lifted the bottle to his mouth , his head thrown back . Gulp-gulp-gulp . The thin screaming from the distant hospitalhad died down . . . to Jo Shelby it had already become a part of the other noises . . . the gurgling of the sucking stream not far from the tent . . . the distant chorus of frogs . the nearer piping of mosquitoes . He felt an immensity of whirling space . All life was nothing in its pervasiveness . It grew in inconceivable whorls , then slowed down in ever-diminishing spirals until it was tiny spinning circles , of many colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speaking very little , and afterwards ordered all vehicles , save only enough to carry the sick and wounded , to be gathered in one place . With these were heaped the tents and other destructible equipment , saving only that which could be carried on horseback and was absolutely essential . Soldiers were ordered to cook up such food as was left , preparatory to carrying it on their saddlesthe rest of the march , and wagon-masters worked at improvisingpack saddles to transport ammunition by mule-back . Old Jo that morning was secretly fighting a black reaction from the debauch of the night before . An ache crushed his head . If the noncombatants had ventured to protest , the result would have stunned them with its violence . But if he had expecteda protest from them , he was disappointed . Congressman Tweedie , the newly converted upholder of military necessity , bustled and argued among them , and with success . Perhaps their acquiescence was helped by the knowledge that it would do them no good whatever to debate the matter . The luxuryp333vehicles were almost all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge fires were made of the tents and the rolling stock , surplus powder and lead was dumped in the river , and the noncombatant train , which had launched on this expeditionwith considerable pomp , took to the road on horseback . There was something both grotesque and ludicrous about the picture they made  --  long coat-tails flying , tall hats clutched to heads , swaying , hunched figures , and faces upon which anxiety was written large  --  and this in spite of the fact that they rode the safest , gentlest horses Shelby could allot . On the other hand , the air with which Congressman Tweedie , on his broadbackedwagon horse , led the procession of his colleagues , was magnificent . His figure was perhaps too rotund to be truly Napoleonic , but he had all the lofty bearing of the Corsican . A sorrier sight was the group of prisoners , who rode with arms bound and legs hobbled , surrounded by guards . Shelby was taking no chances with them . He had spared them their lives , but the necessities of war are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hostages . If any more of his men were captured he did not intend to let them be butchered like those in the village . Of the rolling stock , four covered wagons , the best and stoutestof the lot , were preserved , and in these the wounded were conveyed . Yet in spite of everything Dr. Tisdale could do , three of the sufferers were dead before night of the first day , and the others in agony because of the roughness of the road . Shelby was forced to halt frequently to give these wounded rest , and thus the rate of march was necessarily slowed still farther  --  with the food supply , in spite of reduced rations , almost exhausted . The punishment they had received at the river crossing seemed briefly to cow the guerrillas in the hills , for the whole next day they left the marching Brigade alone . But the follow- ing night the harrying tactics commenced again , with longrangeshooting ; and from there on the column was constantly stalked by day and night . The wounded slowed the rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully as much to cut the speed of progress . Hourly the way grew rougher , the grades steeper , the labor more incessant . Again dry camps were made because water wells and tanks were polluted . It all added up , with the constantinterruption of sleep by sniping and the numerous other annoyances , to put the Brigade in a humor more sullen day by day , until there was ugly talk of reprisals against the natives  --  any natives  --  that were encountered . When he heard that , Shelby paraded the Brigade and made a brief speech : " I hear complaints about the reception we 're getting in Mexico . Well , I expect that I know soldiers about as well as anyone . To ask them to quit grumbling is to ask the leopard to change his spots . . . I could remind you that this is all of your own choosing  --  that we 're marching through this hostile and barren country at your insistence . But that decision has been made ; no need to argue its merits now . The need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage . " He paused and swept their ranks with his gray gaze . " Aside from other considerations , it would be a gravely dangerousmatter to arouse any more opposition than we already are facing from the inhabitants of this country . At this moment we are at low ebb . We are handicapped with wounded and with noncombatants . We are short  --  tragically short on rations . We have been fighting constantly and we are weary . But our foes have been the organized guerrillas of the Juarez forces . It is not a general mass uprising of the people that we have had to face . Let me tell you , you have no conception of war at its most terrible aspects until you have faced a frantic people , men , women , and even children , bent upon your destruction . It is nop335part of my desire to court such an uprising . We are short of food , certainly . But we are also near to the French outposts . A day or two at most should get us there . Meantime we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey of his men . Abruptly he ended : " So I say this to you : Complain to your heart 's content  --  but never let me hear of any man 's lifting a hand against Mexican noncombatants ! We 're invaders  --  not murderers and thieves ! " His face relaxed and he spoke drily : " If the conditions were reversedand the Mexicans were marching through Missouri , I reckon we 'd be doing a lot worse to them than these people are to us . So mark this well : Any theft , insult to a woman , or violenceto aged or unarmed , will be summarily dealt with ! Dis-miss ! " Jack-daw grins , somewhat self-conscious , were exchanged as the men fell out of ranks . They knew Old Jo  --  and that his orderswere likely to be bristlingly enforced . But watching them , Shelby wondered . After all it takes more than a speech  --  even a resolute , uncompromising speech with a promise of penalties  --  to reform incorrigibles like these over night . For years Shelby 's men had subsisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothly and systematically as they passed through it . To expect a thousand wild men who were experts at thievery , enjoyed thievery , and prided themselves on their renown in thievery , to give over this thievery which they considered their right , was expecting over-much . And Shelby knew it.  |p336THEY  had abandoned another of the hospital wagons . Only two were left now , because six of those seriously wounded who had begun the last leg of the journey from the river , were all that remained alive . The others had been buried back on the road ; and the two remaining wagons , so bad was the trail , were more trouble than all the rest of the column put together . SometimesShelby 's troopers had to dismount and struggle with inadequatetools to build short stretches of road around particularlydifficult shoulders , and often sweating crews of dismountedcavalrymen swarmed along , bracing up with poles the careening wagons to prevent them from toppling over into some canyon . The tortures the wounded in these wagons suffered during that terrible journey were sickening to contemplate , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a good chance for eventual recovery , on the ground that having stood what they had gone through , hardly anything that could happen would be able to kill them . Clay had been relieved , temporarily at least , of his post with the advance , and with Gonder and Janeicke , the two survivors of his detachment , told to take it easy for a while in the columnsletting someone else bear the brunt of labor and danger.  |p337What  was more acceptable , there were at last the beginnings of an understanding between Shelby and his junior captain , and the general no longer looked at him , " like a bull at a bastard calf , " to use Esau Janeicke 's inelegant but apposite phrase . This is not to say that Shelby had become cordial . But he no longer bristled when Clay appeared in his vicinity . As for Clay , he was finding it difficult to ride in leisurely fashion with the column . There had been days and nights duringthose weeks of strenuous service with the advance , when he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was now experiencing . But now that he had it , he found himself steadily wishing that Shelby would give him a new command and put him once more out in front . Life there , at least , was not tedious . . . To occupy his time and mind , he took to riding along with the Mexican prisoners . He had liked Senor Anda and Father Bartolome since the Piedras Negras days , and he had ambitionsto learn the language . Therefore he sometimes rode for miles , talking with the alcalde in English , or learning new words and trying halting sentences in Spanish . If any of Shelby 's men ever held ill-feeling against the prisoners , it had long since been disarmed by the glittering bucktoothedsmiles of plump little Senor Anda . The alcalde continued to be a puzzle to Clay . That he should be in his present predicament seemed utterly without logic or reason . He had none of the appearance of a fighting man , being soft , full of smiles , fond of creature comforts , ox-eyed , and altogether inclined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticeablethat the other prisoners treated him with deep respect . As the alcalde of an important border town , his position among his fellow Mexicans would be high , but the fealty of these seemed to be to the man , not the position . About Father Bartolomethere was less to wonder . The priest 's lean visage , in all truth , seemed better fitted for a soldier than a priest , and Clay well knew that in Mexico it was not unusual for a padre to go into battle with his flock . Considering these matters the day following Shelby 's announcement of a ban on all depredations against the countryside , Clay lounged in his saddle at a footpace down to a ford , where the general himself and some of his staff members were watering their horses as they watched the column toil past . At the moment of Clay 's arrival , two riders broke without warning through the underbrush at the side of the trail , and came right out on the road , almost into the very group of officers surroundingShelby . Clay stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were alike in a sort of congenial disreputability ; they were slightly intoxicated ; and they were most chapfallen at the sight of Shelby . One had a dangling horse-tail beard ; the other 's whiskers were kinky and red . After his first look of surprise , Shelby 's brows lowered fearsomely . " Janeicke and Gonder ! " he said . " What in bloody hell are you doing here ? " The two attempted , ridiculously , to sidle their horses away . " Nawthin ' , seh , " said Esau , hastily . " Jest comin ' back from a scout . " But the general 's eye fell on a bulging sack tied behind Gonder'ssaddle . " You men have been relieved from scouting duty , " he said sternly . " Did anyone tell you to go out independently ? " Then he added suspiciously : " What 's in that bag ? " Gonder gulped . " It 's  --  it 's  --  jest my washing , seh , " he mumbled . Shelby 's mouth tightened forebodingly . " Better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or your washing will bleed top339death . Captain Bennett , put these men under arrest , sir , and bring them to me at the end of the march tonight ! " For the first time Clay observed that blood had soaked through Gonder 's sack , and his concern for the pair became real . As hastily as possible he herded the culprits out of sight of the angry general . " What in hell 's name were . you men doing ? " he demanded when they were safe . " We was  --  well , foragin ' by accident , seh , " replied Janeicke with strange meekness . For all his worry Clay almost laughed . " Oh , you incorrigible prowlers of other people 's hen-roosts ! " he said . " And this , right after Shelby issued strictest orders against molesting privateproperty ! " " It was n't no hen-roost , seh , " corrected Gonder lugubriously . He added that he and his crony had been " squanderin ' around over the country , jest to see what it was like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow gave the impression that it was a feeling of commiseration for the destitute condition of the pig that moved them in what followed . They could not , as it were , bear to see the animal rooting the ground in loneliness and sorrow . So they dismounted and Esau drew his saber . The shoat , horrified by the fate approaching , uttered piercing screams , but Esau struck once and the animal was silent . The companions dressed and cut up the carcass , placing the pieces of pork in a sack which , " merely from habit , seh , " Gonder carriedwith him . " All this , ye unnerstand , Cap'n Bennett , " broke in Janeicke eagerly , " was jest habit an ' not intentional . Afteh ye 've foraged fo ' about everything ye 've et fo ' so many years  --  an ' besides the meat rations is mighty shot , an ' me an ' Gonder was that hongree fo ' barbecued pig  --  the same bein ' a dish that if ye ai n't tasted it , ye 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " Clay nodded . " And you were so filled with anticipations that you blundered directly into General Shelby , " he finished for them . " And you call yourself scouts ! I do n't mind the foraging . It 's the walking right into the general , by two men who 're supposed to know how to move in the country and keep their wits and eyes about them , that makes me sick . You 'll certainly catch hell tonight  --  and you deserve it ! " The culprits looked at him beseechingly . " That 's what 's worryin ' us , " said Gonder . " What do you . suppose he 'll do ? " " He 'll break you both , for one thing . I do n't know what else . " " Cap'n , will you do us a favor , seh ? " asked Gonder suddenly . " A little bit of a favor ? " " That depends , " Clay said suspiciously . They made known their request , and he hesitated long , but after a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he was genuinely fond of the scamps , and more particularly because they were all that was left of the command he once had led , he agreed . That evening . he surreptitiously carried a package wrapped in sacking and left it at Shelby 's bivouac . Shortly after mess , an orderly summoned Clay to the general . The days of luxury were ended . There were no tents now , but a fire still burned because the sun had not yet set . Clay found Shelby seated on a rock , with a curious expression on his bearded face . " Do you know what that is ? " he asked , looking his captain squarely in the eye and indicating the burlap-wrapped package at his feet . Not trusting himself to speak , Clay remained silent.  | " It is a quarter of fresh pork , " Shelby informed him without a smile . " I found it here when I returned a few minutes ago . I am mighty hungry for fresh pork , and the sight of it makes my mouth water . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But on consideration , I do not think it right to punish men severely for just having a little laundry . I refer to Janeicke and Gonder . Tell them to consider themselves under arrest , and ride in the prisoners ' train until I send for them . I 'll decide in the meantime what to do . " The outstanding surprise of the expedition had been the noncombatanttrain , simply because its soft and fleshy conglomerate of governors , senators , and congressmen , had survived , in remarkablevigor and stentorian voice , the privations the Brigade had thus far experienced . To be sure they were called upon for no work , their wants were supplied , their food even was prepared for them , and they faced no more danger than was inherentmerely in riding anywhere in Shelby 's column . Yet consideringeverything , their endurance was wonderful , as was their united lung-power , which was raised morning , noon , and night , in protest against fresh outrages put upon them  --  such as any further straitening of rations , or other necessary sacrifices . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenderly nursing his wound  --  although it by now had almost completely healed  --  he considered himself a man apart . He even made efforts to fraternize with Shelby , as fellow champions of a common cause . The general made shift at tolerating Tweedie , but he gave no longer any pretense of patience with the other civilians , swearing and stamping , and fiercely blowing out his beard , until the complainantsretreated , leaving the air much cleared behind them . Janeicke and Gonder , Clay soon saw , were far from downcastby their relegation to the prisoners ' train . They found it vastly entertaining . Gonder was instructing Esau in Spanish , and here was a golden opportunity for practice . There were , moreover , some recondite questions of cock-fighting practice to be cleared with the padre and the alcalde . Finally , the swashbucklingGonder , loving as ever the sound of his own voice , brought a rapt look to the face of Senor Anda , with his circumstantialnarrative of the ritual of the " Missouri duel , " where the antagonists grip opposite corners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with bowie knives . " Ai ! " sighed the little alcalde wistfully . " Thees I would ' weesh to see . Ees mos ' beautiful ! De ultima modo . . . some time , if the dear Dios ees ver ' good to me , perhaps I can hope to witness the Mizzou-ree duelo . Ees to be more prefer to the corrida de toros , the bull fight . I suggest ! " During this commentary , the Brigade had come to a halt . Up ahead an excitement most unusual had suddenly made itself manifest . Gonder and Janeicke craned their necks . Slowly the word worked itself back from mouth to mouth  --  Captain Rutledge , far forward with the advance , had just sent a galloper back to Shelby . He had seen two videttes in a notch of the hills . They must be French . The men discussed this gleefully . Presentlythe order came back to move forward again . With a new will the Brigade rode up the rocky road . Far up front the distant videttes poised for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they scurried out of sight . Before the Brigade reached the base of the escarpment , a small body of French cavalry appeared on its crest , and presently rode down toward Shelby 's staff to parley , a white flag snapping from a lance at the head . The Brigade waited eagerly . It was high time the French were showing up . All those weeks during which the Brigade had dragged its way through the wilderness , starving and harried by enemies , approached culmination . Now , at last , civilization had beenp343reached , and the men were almost on the point of cheering when the strangers rode up . The French looked smart enough in their blue coats and red trousers , and their leader , a young officer with a glossy black beard , after saluting , addressed Shelby in English : " General Shelby ? I have the honor to present Colonel de Saul 's compliments . He knows of your approach and sends me to guide you to our camp . " " I 'm delighted to hear someone in this country speaking our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Colonel de Saul speaks it . And you will find General Jeanningros , commandant at Monterrey , adept in it . Will you be so good as to follow me ? " Would they ? The whole Brigade , weary of the barbarous wilderness , made ready eagerly to ride , as if to a haven . But Clay , back with the prisoners , saw that at the name of the French commandant , repeated back from the front by the men , the Mexicans seemed suddenly stricken with fear . " De Saul ? " they said one to another . " Madre Dios ! " " What ails them ? " Clay asked Gonder . The red-beard shook his head . Every prisoner had turned toward Senor Anda , and in harsh , high voices they chattered together . The guard , alert at this unusual demonstration , rode closer to prevent any effortat a break . But Clay 's eyes fell on Senor Anda  --  and remained there . About the little alcalde his people huddled like sheep . He himself was helpless , trussed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him . A swift change had come over him in this moment of crisis . Gone was the pompous , strutting , flabby manner . Senor Anda 's eyes had narrowed and hardened ; his lips drew tight beneath the little waxed mustache which now bristled with defiance . Of all the prisoners he alone seemed self-contained , alert , unfrightened . Over Clay it sud- denly came that in all the time he had known the alcalde this man had been playing a part . Instead of a- fawning , ineffective clown , he was suddenly as purposeful as a steel chisel . Hitherto Senor Anda had sat in silence , but his eyes suddenly fixed themselves on Clay 's face , and he spoke very quickly and earnestly . " Mi capitln ! " he said . " You must know  --  thees de Saul , he ees no man . Ees a monster  --  w demonio ! You mus ' go , tell ' Shell-by I deemand protection as prisionero de guerra  --  for me an ' for thees people . He mus ' not geev us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of the gr-reatest cruel ! An act the dear Dios would hate . . . " " Why ? " Clay was impressed by the intensity of the other 's manner , but he wanted some reasons also . Senor Anda stared at him as if making up his mind what to say . " Senor , I weel tell you somet'ings . You call me Senor Ignacio Anda , the fat alcalde of Piedras Negras , si ? But all Coahuila , she know me by anozzer name  --  I am call El Gato  --  " " El Gato ! " exclaimed Clay , thunderstruck . " Ees true , " the Mexican earnestly assured him . " Before los extra geros  --  the eenvaders  --  come , I live in peace . I haff leetle hacienda in the sierra . I haff my casa in Piedras Negras , an ' my people I love . I fight my gallos de pelea ; I dreenk my aguardiente ; I take my siesta  --  mira , I am ver ' happee ! But when thees war come  --  thees Maximiliano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countree . I am fete of thees poor hombres . I wage the war against Shell-by all the way up from Texas . I plan the emboscada . I am your enemy . Bien ! But you catch me , an ' ees our plan to keep secret my name because I might get away if you do not guard me too close . But now we meet weeth thees de Saul . Valgame Dios ! You hall not hear of him ? Ees jefe of the contre guerrillas of Bazaine ! "  |p345He  looked at Clay as if the mere mention of that name should stir him , but , the captain did not understand . " Leesten what I weel tell you , " the little jefe continued almostdesperately . " Thees de Saul ees cutthroat , robber , assassin ! He was  --  thees I ' know from true source  --  he was despidido , what you call cashiered  --  from the French army for looting the Imperial palacio at Peking , when Louis Napoleon invade China  --  you remember ? But when Maximiliano von Hapsburg come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those decoration , those rank , to de Saul . Por que ? ffecause he need un carnicero  --  a butcher  --  for work in Mexico ! De Saul ees mos ' apt for that work . I suggest ! He raise up regimentio of bad mans  --  the worst in Europe  --  which he call contre guerrillas . Senor , thees ees hired assassins of helpess peones . Ah , senor , for the sweet sake of the Holy Mother , do not permit us to be geev to thees man ! " As if understanding in a dim way what their jefe was saying , the other prisoners echoed the last plea with a heart-breaking wail . Clay stared at El Gato , then at the others , hardly believinghis ears . " Si  --  si  --  senor , you mus ' believe ! " insisted the alcalde . " I am truly El Gato . No man would de Saul rather get into hees hands . Ees more cruel as a tarantula ! He torment , he torture . He haff a saying : When you keel a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heem . But when you cut off a arm or a leg , he ees thrown on the charity of hees friends  --  they mus ' support heem . Those who make corn can not make soldados . Ees economy to operate . ' Hondreds , belief me , sefior  --  hondreds haff pass onder the hands of hees surgeons . ' One haff a hand lopped off ; anozzera foot . Sometime the tongue or ears go weeth the limb . The mutilated ees in every city from Mier to Monterrey . Ask El General Shell-by , in the name of the Madre , do not place us in the mercy of thees scorpion ! "  | Clay was now wholly convinced . " I wish you 'd told me of this sooner , " he said , " but I guess you had your reasons . I 've got to get to Shelby at once . " Out of the column he swung his horse and spurred hard up the hill , hoping to overtake the staff before it reached the crest . But the Brigade was now marching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost as the ranks scrambled among the broken boulders , so that the troops fairly choked the passage . Vainly Clay tried to force a way through the mass . " Open up ! Open up , there ! " he shouted until he was hoarse . " Staff business ! Make a way ! " But though the nearest ranks heard and tried to give him the road , there was so much noise that he could not make the ranks in front understand , and his progress was tragically slow . By the time he finally forced his way through and overtook Shelby , the latter was at the top of the little pass , and had halted his horse to gaze downward . In full view was the French camp , which stood a quarter of a mile below the notch in a pleasant mountain valley  --  regular rows of white tents , very pleasing to the eye , with the red and blue cavalry drawn up before them . A group of mounted officers , advancing up the hill to meet the American general , had almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasped Clay . " A matter of importance . " " What is it ? " asked Shelby frowning . " Those prisoners  --  the Mexicans , sir . They say they will be executed immediately if they are turned over to the French . They ask for protection as their right as prisoners of war . " " Their right ? " barked Shelby . " What right ? They do not wage civilized war , so why should they expect us to ? " But he tugged his beard and sat his horse scowling at the oncoming Frenchmen . " Yet if it 's true  --  why did n't they say so before , anyway ? " His scowl deepened . Then : " Probably exaggeration , though . These Mexicans ca n't be kept from lying . "  | " By your leave , sir , I believe them to be telling the truth . Senor Anda , sir , has just given me an amazing piece of information . He is actually El Gato , the guerrilla leader . We 've had that jefe in our hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shelby 's frown vanished and his face showed sudden intense interest . " What are you telling me , sir ? That fat little alcalde is El Gato ? It 's God damned hard to believe . . . yet thinking back , there were one or two occasions . . . Maybe he can give us some information on Parridine ! I 'll talk with him . No , I wo n't have a chance . Bennett , there 's nothing I can do at this late date if the French want those prisoners  --  there 's Colonel de Saul right in front of us . Even if Anda 's telling the truth I 'm powerless to help him under the circumstances . Why in hell did n't he speak up sooner ? Remember that the French are , after all , the legal authority for the side for which we hope to fight . " The French staff was within fifty yards , and now the commanderdrew up his horse and saluted , his officers following suit . Next the colonel rode forward and Shelby advanced to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chilling sensation . His face was tanned and brooding . Against the dark olive of his skin , his dazzlingly white hair , mustache , and imperial stood out sharply . Like his subordinate who had first greeted Shelby , he spoke English , but more brokenly . The use of English , Shelby 's men were to learn , was an accomplishment commonin the French foreign service . As the two commanders sat their horses beside the road and conversed , the Brigade rode past , over the crest , and down the other side . All at once the Frenchman stirred . His cold eye had fallen on the captives , just then being herded by . " Prisoners ! " he exclaimed . " Yes , " said Shelby . " I captured them in a fight at the river . " A gleam of terrible joy illumined the brown countenance  --   | momentary only , and instantly repressed . " Ah , brave A , mericaines ! " cried de Saul . " You should be saluted wiz sloping standards . These men are outlaws  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I wish to deliver them personally to General Jeanningros , " he said . Surprise chilled de Saul 's features . " As you weesh , monsieur , " he said indifferently . It was easy to see that he was deeply offended . Shelby was in a difficult position , one which might easily contain dangerous potentialities . Above all things he desired to avoid ill-feeling on the part of the French , particularlyat this time . The very fate of the Brigade and every man in it depended on this . He glanced uncomfortably from de Saul to the prisoners , and back again to de Saul , indecision on his features  --  an expression most rare for him . " If I turn these men over to you , colonel , " he asked at last , as if salving his conscience , " they will , of course , be well treated and justly dealt with ? " " Mais certainement ! " De Saul looked him squarely in the eye . " Then I agree , " Shelby said hesitantly . The prisoners were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glare they went silent , their eyes , worried and preoccupied , turning hopelessly from one to another of the officers . El Gato alone stared expressionlessly straight ahead , and Clay wondered what thoughts were behind the mask of his face . A detachment of de Saul 's troops rode forward , to close about the little knot of Mexicans.  |p349HEADS  close together , so that the red beard almost mingled with the black , Gonder and Janeicke had watched the transaction of the prisoners . There was in their faces concern , particularly for El Gato , who , they considered , held sound views on certain esoteric aspects of chicken fighting , and showed signs , under their earnest evangelism , of being willing to recant on some of his other , more heretical , beliefs . As the contre guerrillas herded the Mexicans away , the two scouts turned to Clay . " What they goin ' to do with them pris'ners ? " demanded Gonder . " We had to turn them over . I think they 'll be all right , " said Clay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonel looks like a side-windin ' rattlesnake , " growled Janeicke . " But mebbe it 's all right . Them French is supposed to be white folks , ai n't they ? " Clay nodded . Gonder , however , remained skeptical . " What do you think 's liable to happen ? " he insisted . " Shelby has de Saul 's promise , " replied Clay . " They 're to be well treated , and receive full justice . " " It has a bad sound , " grumbled Gonder . " Jestice can be interpreted in so many ways  --  especially by a frawg . " The column now was plunging downward from the notch , a long undulating flood of mounted figures , eager to arrive at its destination . " Thar 's somep'n spookin ' them hosses up front , " suddenly remarked Janeicke . Clay had noticed it too  --  animals shying off to the right from some object that frightened them at the left side of the road , riders craning their necks . As he and the scouts , riding in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each new file of men swearing . Something huge and black flapped awkwardly , close overhead . A zipolote . The Mexican buzzard lifted its heavy body and soared over the tree tops . In another moment Clay saw . . . why the zipolote had flown so sluggishly . A large mango tree stood within twenty yards of the highway , and from its branches hung strange , unnaturalfruit . . . six corpses . There is nothing pretty about a dead man hanging by his neck , especially when you are weary after a long march . And these had been dead unpleasantly for days . Their heads were twisted at awkward angles , and their faces were black and bloated . From two of the mouths black tongues protruded . The rest had no mouths . No faces . Every head was dreadfully ripped and gouged , eyeless and with the skull pan torn open . . . . A score of zipolotes , artisans of this horror , swung in the sky , very low , just over the tops of the trees . They were larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the tips of their wings were white . The coming of the column had frightened them off and they soared , or slowly flapped their immense black wings irritably until they could resume their interrupted gorge . Below them the dead awaited patiently , dangling so straight downward fromp351the ropes at their necks that they seemed stretched out of all normal length . And the smell of death hung heavy in the air . Shelby 's men did not like that mango tree or its burden , nor did Shelby like it . Gonder and Janeicke liked it least of all . " That cinches it , " Gonder growled . " El Gato knowed what was goin ' to happen . " Fifteen minutes later , when they rode into camp , an orderly notified Clay to report to Shelby . The general was with Edwards , in the middle of the inevitable chaos of a camp in the process of being established , and he was giving final assignmentsfor camping stations . Already a line of supply wagons from the French was discharging welcome food for the Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said sharply , " I want to know more about those Mexicans . " " Nothing more , sir , that I can tell you . Senor Anda , or rather El Gato , told me  --  " " You 're certain in your mind that this El Gato business is no hoax ? " " General , if ever I saw a man telling the truth , Anda was . " Shelby removed his soiled hat and slapped it against his thigh to beat the dust off it . " I 'm glad we did n't give de Saul any inkling who we 'd caught . You say El Gato was sure they 'd be executed ? " " Yes , sir . He said de Saul was a butcher  --  said he practiced mutilations  --  " " That 's enough . " Flat voice , pin-pupiled eyes . The general 's dander is up , thought Clay . Shelby 's having a battle with his conscience . He knows the tough logic of his position  --  the prisonersdo n't belong to him and there 's danger in antagonizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are on his mind . Shelby turned with sudden decision . " I 'm God damned ifp352I 'll let some slippery French bastard think he 's pulled the wool over my eyes . ' Justice , ' hell ! I know what justice he means . I 've got a right to protest . By the gullet of God , I 'm going to protest ! " He replaced his hat on his head . Tapped it down firmly with his palm . " Edwards , you come along . You too , Bennett . And send for Slayback and Collins . Might as well make it a formal affair . Justice ! ' " Clay was the junior officer in the group that rode over to the French camp . Not since Austin had he been included in staff affairs , but he had little time now to consider if this meant any permanent change in his status . French guards halted them , saluted , and they were allowed to approach the headquarters of Colonel de Saul . The French commander stepped out of his tent as the Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the Frenchman , saluting . But Shelby went straight to the point . " Colonel de Saul , " he said , " I just saw something up the road that I did n't like . Those dead Mexicans . " " Oui ? " replied de Saul . " Then I am desolated . " He gave them a fox grin . " We do not do things so in my country , " Shelby continued sternly . " Permit me , general , to remind you that you are not in your country . " There was cold emphasis on the last words . Shelby ignored it . " I had your pledge . Justice for the men I turned over to you ! " " Justice they will get , " said de Saul , his voice suddenly thick with insolence . " A justice they richly deserve ! " " Colonel de Saul ! You understand what I mean ! " The Frenchman bowed . He was not apprehensive , for he knew how helpless Shelby was . " I answer , mon ami , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke with enough impertinence to have caused him to be shot in Missouri , but Shelby , who never had possessed an easy temper , opened his mouth , grew dark in the face , then by a Herculean effort closed his mouth again . A quarrel was one thing he could not now afford . But a quarrel , to judge by his actions , was the very purpose of de Saul . His hard brown face turned and he rasped an order in English  --  to be understood by these Americans . " Captain Radisson ! " The young officer with the black beard , who first had met the Brigade , stepped forward and saluted smartly in the French manner . " The mango tree  --  see that it bears new fruit at sunset ! " The captain saluted again , and wheeled away . The Americans were speechless . " You are in the tropics , General Shelby , " said de Saul , sneering . " This is July , but trees here bear fruit in most unexpected seasons . " Without a word of reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trot out of camp . Silently they rode , and the general 's face was a spectacle to watch . His staff forebore speaking , because anyone could see that Jo Shelby was riding his wrath . Now it would buck up and nearly get away from him . Then his judgment would gain the upper hand and throttle his rage for awhile  --  only to have it come surging back again . It was awe-inspiring , almost , to see the general fighting to control his anger . He succeeded , but the effort left him more weary than a day 's hard ride . In camp the Brigade was seething also . Those dead men dangling at the ends of their ropes had brought an ugly awakening . Shelby 's men had supposed themselves out of the reach of savagery when they met the French . They had been prepared to greet the emperor 's troops like brothers . Now they perceived that all they had done was to exchange the brutality of primitive Mexico for that of the contra guerrillas . Clay was waylaid by Gonder . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You guessed right , " said Clay bitterly . " Cap'n , we cai n't let it happen ! We got to save those men . We 're honor bound , the way I look at it  --  the old padre par-ticular . " " So I feel . And so the general feels , " agreed Clay . " But Shelby could do nothing . I never expected him to take what he took off those Frenchmen anyway . Only the safety of the Brigade  --  " " It ai n't Shelby an ' the Brigade I 'm thinkin ' about , " broke in Gonder . " It 's me  --  an ' you , cap'n . " " I fail to follow . " " Listen , seh . I never told you this before , but Father Bartolomesaved your life in that trouble with Parridine at Piedras Negras . " " The priest ? " ejaculated Clay . " How in hell did he figure ? " " Remember my bet with Parridine  --  dollars against bullets ? " " I 'm not likely to forget . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started it , the padre finished it ! " " In God 's name , man , quit talking riddles . " " I knew Parridine was crazed on gamblin ' . When I found he was goin ' to the chicken fight , I talked it over with Esau . We figgered we might get Parridine into some bettin ' , us knowin ' more about the birds than ' most anybody around there . You saw it work out . " The last was said with complacency . It was one of Gonder 's great prides and boasts that he was an expert on the " chickens . " " I saw it . And I gather you are not entirely ignorant on the subject , " said Clay drily . " But we was n't leavin ' things to pure chance  --  not with ap355thimble-rigger like Parridine . We decided to make it a simonpurecinch . So we hunted up Father Bartolome  --  " " I begin to comprehend . . . " " We told him the story  --  he 's a full-growed man , seh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found out somebody 's life was up . Here was the plan : If I could get Parridine to fritter his money , I figgered to make a final bet on the last fight , countin ' on his gamblin ' fever to make him accept . The only thing I did n't count on was that pole-cat trick of bettin ' only five instead of all six of his allotted shots . I could 've stopped that , but I did n't have my wits about me , an ' he had me in a hole before I knew what he was doin ' . " " Even so it saved my life . " " So it developed , seh . But fo ' a time it looked bad . Anyway , to get back , Father Bartolome was sure his bird , Que Guapo , would beat Anda 's chicken . I hoped Parridine would bet on the alcalde 's rooster , but I was n't takin ' no chances . I was to let Father Bartolome know which it was : If Anda 's , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Que Guapo , the right . When Parridine decided on the padre 's bird  --  an ' the old priest lovin ' that fowl the way he done  --  I felt like a dog . But it was a man 's life against the rooster 's . So I give the signal  --  " " You stroked your beard three times with your right hand . " " You noticed , seh ? " " I had no idea what it meant . " " Well , you know what Father Bartolome did  --  let that red bird of Anda 's kill his chicken , by turnin ' its blind side toward the opp'sition . Fo ' him it was jest like condemnin ' a friend to death . An ' he done it , seh , because of you  --  " Clay walked back and forth . " I had no idea of the priest 's part in this , " he said . " I must be pretty stupid . I see it now , though , and it 's pretty clear that I 've got to do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here execution happen ? " " Sunset . " Gonder said abruptly : " You must not appear in this ! " " I 'll do my part . " " hope . It jest come over me . If anything went wrong an ' one of Shelby 's off'cers was mixed up in it , the consequences would be jest a little unhappy fo ' the whole expedition , I 'm thinkin ' . We got to figger some other way . " He paused . " Say , you got any whiskey ? " " Whiskey ? No . " " Any tequila , then ? " " Gonder , this is a poor time  --  " " God knows , seh , I ai n't aimin ' to get drunk . But I got a friend I want in that there happy condition . Here 's what 's in my mind : We could bushwhack the execution party . But that would involve Shelby somethin ' terrible  --  armed attack by his sojers . Now what if some irrespons'ble pussons  --  thoroughly an ' demonstrably irrespons'ble  --  jest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The French could ha'dly hold Shelby to blame fo ' that , could they ? " " I suppose not , " said Clay doubtfully . " If I can get Esau Janeicke to he'p me , things might get accomplished , " Gonder said . " Only Esau ai n't no good at histrionics , or dissemblin ' . Moreover , while he 's stronger'n Adam 's off ox , an ' mean an ' fierce to boot , he needs stim'latin ' befo ' he 'll fly in the face of author'ty an ' do the plumb reckless . An ' plumb reckless this here 's got to be . I got an idea , but I got to get Esau good an ' drunk fust . An ' it 'll take tequila  --  an ' a little gin  --  " Clay looked him in the eye . " I 'll get the tequila . " " An ' gin ? " " And gin . "  |p357The  French and American camps were pitched a quarter of a mile apart , and in view of the tense circumstances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own troopers in bounds , and prevent possible trouble with the French . At one of these outposts Clay and Gonder discovererd Esau . He was standing near a small grove of trees overlooking the road which led to the notch in the hills , and as they approached him , he swung his huge head around so that his beard whipped the breeze . " Even from hyar the place fair stinks of them frawgs , " he grumbled peevishly . Gonder closed one of his shrewd little eyes at Clay . " Mebbe a snort of the 0-Be-Joyful would he'p you bear that malod'rouseffluvium you mention , " he suggested . " What ye got ? " asked Esau , becoming instantly more cheerful . His face , however , clouded at the sight of the tequila bottle . " Ye shorely do n't expect me to drink no mo ' of that ? " He expectorated tobacco juice disgustedly . " I 'd give a arm fo ' one good swig of cawn-licker , " he mourned . " My friend , " said Gonder benignantly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ char'cter , is a ce'tain lack of catholicity in your tastes  --  " " Cath'licity ! " exclaimed Esau . " I was doused by the Fo'ty Gallon Baptists , an ' got convickshun of orig'nal sin with the Predestinatin ' Presbyterians . Of course I done backslid from both of ' em , but I 'm a Protestant whichever ! " " Tush , " soothed the red-beard . " Do n't hackle up an ' yell so quick . Not ontil you got occasion , leastwise . I ai n't talkin ' religion . What I referred to was a vestich of provincialism I detect in your feelin ' fo ' drinkin ' licker. " " ticker ? That ai n't no licker ! It ai n't fitten to be mentioned along with Taney County moonshine . It 's a malignant concoctionof the juice of the cactus , an ' onfit fo ' human consump- tion ! I druther stay sober . " " In that , " said Gonder loftily , " you do injestice to the cheer . Your trouble , Esau , is that you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ce'tain ingredients  --  gin , limes , sugar , an ' the like  --  with which I propose to introduce you to a decoctioncalled  --  with some genius fo ' the descriptif  --  a Coahuila E'thquake . " While Janeicke watched with deep suspicion written on his features , Gonder began his business with the ingredients . Esau accepted , almost with reluctance , the cup proffered him . But when he tasted the poisonous-looking preparation , his eye brightened . He tasted it freely , and grinned cavernously . He drained the cup . " I reckon you 'll have another ? " Gonder was saying , as Clay discreetly withdrew . Very jovial and expansive , Gonder and Janeicke strolled right into the middle of the execution which was being preparedunder the mango tree up the road . The five Mexican prisoners stood with arms bound and nooses about their necks beneath the branches from which the feet of their dead countrymenswayed less than a yard above their heads . Captain Radisson was supervising the adjusting of the nooses , and he was in a hurry to finish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stench from the rotting corpses above turned his stomach . He had no feeling whatever for the Mexicans who stood helpless and silent , seemingly paralyzed by the fate that was now certain for them  --  with the exception of the priest who loudly intoned the absolution and the prayer for the dying , committing , as it were , his own soul , and those of his comrades , to heaven with a single , wholesale gesture . Hanging Mexicans was only a routine task for Captain Radisson . He wished , however , that Colonel de Saul would at least permitp359the selection of a different tree each time . This business of working in the revolting smell of death , he would be sworn , was unhealthy . Get the job over and away as soon as possible , he thought . Radisson frowned as two figures emerged from the bushes beside the road  --  a red-bearded figure and a black-bearded one . " Howdy , cap'n , " said the red-beard , with a friendly wave that almost upset him , causing him to clasp his companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Radissonwith broad and not very respectful grins . " Mind if we watch them proceedin 's ? " hiccoughed Gonder . Said Janeicke : " Been so long sense I seen a hangin ' I a'most fo'git how it 's done . We gen'rally shoot ' em in the States . " He was , Captain Radisson observed , chewing tobacco  --  a repulsiveAmerican custom  --  and the quid bulged his hairy cheek . " Messieurs , you may watch , " the French captain said , without any cordiality , however . He disapproved the slack observanceof rank that was apparent among these people , but he was not sure enough of his ground to be short and decisive with them , as he would have liked . So he turned his back on them , to watch the sergeant who was adjusting the noose . " Beggin ' pardon , cap'n , " said the red-bearded American behind him . " That ai n't no way to hang a man . You want the knot under his left ear , not at the back of his neck . Unless you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate to see ' em kick , do n't you ? Lemme show you . " Had Radisson been facing the Americans he might possibly have averted what followed , but now , before he realized what was happening , Gonder had stepped around him , shoulderedaside the surprised sergeant , and was handling the noose which was being adjusted about the neck of the short , fat Mexican , with the waxed mustache . " Stop ! " Radisson cried sharply . " Do not dare to touch those rope . I shall have you under arrest  --  " " Ye cai n't mean that , cap'n , " said Esau , deeply wounded in his inebriated feelings , " when all we wants to do is he'p ye  --  " " Ignorant drunkards ! " shouted Radisson , his patience gone . Esau Janeicke stepped forward and spit expertly a stream of tobacco juice into the Frenchman 's eyes . In the next few minutes many things happened , but Radissondid not see any of them . Blinded by the stinging liquid , the captain stumbled about , pawing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He heard a shout , then many shouts . A gun was discharged . Then he himself was lifted high in the air by some prodigious strength , and hurled for what seemed a terrific distance , striking flesh  --  his own men  --  bearing them to the ground with the force of his propulsion . The sharp smack of fists impacting against jaws came to Captain Radisson 's ears , as he lay there , shaken and moaning , on top of two or three of his groaning soldiers . There was also the pound and shuffleof struggling feet , the sick grunt of a man struck in the pit of his stomach , a heavy panting and swearing . And finally , subsidence of the noises . Radisson succeeded at last in clearing his eyes enough to see a little , although the pain of the tobacco juice was almost more than he could bear . His blurred vision revealed that the Americans had at last been borne to the ground , where they lay battered , bleeding and bound . His own soldiers , a dozen of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood , furious , almost weeping with rage and humiliation . The prisoners were gone . All of them.  |p361SHELBY  had the look of a man snake-bitten . This was the thing above all that he had wished to avoid  --  trouble with the French . This might mean the death of his hopes in Mexico . " Janeicke and Gonder  --  those scoundrels again ? " he groaned . " I ought to let them hang . By God , I 've got a notion to let the bastards hang ! " Yet he knew that regardless of everything he must prevent that hanging  --  it was a matter of prestige  --  of face . Should he allow summary execution of two of his men , without authority from himself , he might as well quit in Mexico . He would be finished , without any real authority over his own soldiers , or respect from the French . To Colonel Slayback , therefore , he gave quick orders . The Brigade was to get to horse . Shelby was going with Thrailkill 's company to see about this hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a quarter of a mile to the mango tree , " he told Slayback as he swung into his saddle . " If you hear that bugle , come a-running . " Shelby 's men had been known to get to horse very quickly , but on this occasion they surpassed any former record . From the time the fat little Mexican , El Gato , appeared momentarily at the edge of camp , and called out his word of warning to Captain Bennett , to the moment when Shelby , with his escort , galloped out of camp , very few minutes elapsed . There was no joking in Thrailkill 's company which rode behind Shelby . The men loosened the carbines in their sheaths , and their faces were grim and set . The thing that had thus far saved Janeicke and Gonder was that Captain Radisson had delayed hanging them until Colonel de Saul could arrive to take personal charge , and incidentally to give the requisite authority . Colonel de Saul , livid with his anger , was directing the preparations , when he heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry bearded faces swept up . Beneath the mango tree with its forbidding " fruit , " Janeicke and Gonderstood surrounded by contre guerrillas , ropes already about their necks . Esau still was profoundly drunk , teetering on his heels , and loudly insulting his captors . Gonder , however , seemed suddenly sober  --  and very serious . Back on its haunches Shelby pulled his horse , and in the dust the two commanders eyed each other in a silence which crackled with tension . Then the Missourian spoke three words : " Release those men ! " De Saul 's face stiffened savagely . " You still do not appear to realize , general , that you are no longer in your own country , " his deathly voice said . " These men have violated the law  --  interfered wiz a military execution , attacked the uniform of France , aided prisoners to escape . The penalty of any of these is death . " His men never forgot Shelby 's bitter laugh . " These men are Americans  --  not peones ! Give them back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel de Saul ! " To the right and left de Saul glanced . Behind Shelby massed scores of granite visages , and clear across the quarter-mile distanceintervening between the mango tree and the Americanp363camp , could be heard the voices of officers , bawling orders , as the Brigade formed . But it was Shelby 's face which told the Frenchman of his real peril . De Saul chose not to take up the gauntlet . " Laissez aller les Prisoners ! " his choking voice ordered . Janeicke and Gonder grinned with relief as they were freed . For the last quarter hour they had been close to death and they felt vastly happier . But their grins faded when they confronted Shelby . " Get out of my sight ! " he roared . The scamps shuffled hurriedly away , and de Saul stepped to Shelby 's horse . " Monsieur le general ! " he said . " You shall answer to me for this ! " " It will be my pleasure ! " snarled Shelby . For a moment they confronted each other , the Frenchman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Shelby turned back to his own camp . His officers looked at each other with foreboding . A duel  --  with Shelby 's crippled right arm to handicap him ? But Shelby himself did not seem concerned . He fumed for awhile beside his fire , but Major Edwards later reported it was the incident of Esau and Gonder over which he was fuming . " What will you do , sir , when de Saul challenges you ? " venturedthe adjutant at last . " Kill him , " said Shelby . " Your arm , general  --  " " I 'll shoot  --  and kill  --  with my left ! " From reveille next morning , the Confederates went about their duties with angry eyes on the French camp . Everyone had heard of the threat to Shelby , and the men grew wrathful , so that there even was some talk of sallying over in a body , without any official orders , and extirpating once and for all this de Saul and all his thievish contre guerrillas . Such talk , however , raveled itself out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was supposed that de Saul would send over a formal delegation with his challenge . But nine o'clock came and there was no sign . About that hour a courier from the south rode into the French camp . Had they known de Saul as well as they were to come to know him , Shelby 's men might have spared themselves the worry of that night and morning . The contre guerrilla chief , they were to learn , would prefer to choose a way much more devious , and perhaps more certain , than a duel . An important message was borne to de Saul that morning by the courier . General Jeanningros , commandant at Monterrey , had learned of Shelby 's coming , and he now ordered de Saul to bring the Americans in at once . Presently an officer rode over from the French camp with a stiffly worded message , to which Shelby replied in agreement equally stiff to the request that he accompany the French in their march back to the city . Thus , with bad blood between them , and a challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and American , rode over the mountains together that afternoon and the next day , until at last the Missourians saw a long valley in the mountains , and in it many flat-roofed houses , tinted yellow , blue , pink , or white , with green shutters which gave a feeling of deep coolness . They were looking upon Monterrey . And when they rode from the pine-clad hills they found themselves in the tropics , where mimosas , mangos and banana trees took the place of the pines , and shaded the houses . At the entrance to the city , the French garrison had turnedout to meet the Brigade , and as Shelby approached , a short , brusque man , who had grown gray in the service of his country , rode forward to exchange salutes with the American leader . Clay never forgot that strangely assorted pair  --  General 6 5Jeanningros and General Shelby  --  nor the picture they made as they sat their horses between the lines , the American bearded , square-set , and fierce ; the Frenchman regarding him with a hard-lipped smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impression of complete candor , and from the first he and Shelby seemed to understand each other . " Barracks have been provided for your men , general , " said the Frenchman . " Pray make yourselves comfortable  --  they are yours as long as you decide to honor us here at Monterrey . Meantime , it would give me pleasure to have you call upon me at my home  --  whenever it is most convenient to yourself  --  for a mutual discussion of our affairs . I have assigned an attache as your guide . " Together the two generals rode down the lines of the Brigade and of the French garrison , in an inspection , and Jeanningros was intensely interested in the complete substitutionof the revolver for the saber in the Confederate equipment . The inspection finished , Shelby ordered Major Edwards to proceed with dispositions at the barracks , and he and Jeanningrosconversed pleasurably for some time before the latter returned to his own quarters . Soon after Shelby bade farewell to the French general , Clay was summoned to his office . The captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time since the expeditionbegan , the general relaxed his stiffness with Clay . " I like that fellow Jeanningros ! " he exclaimed . " I believe we can deal with him . A different proposition entirely from that reptile , de Saul . " He stroked his whiskers while Clay , at attention , regarded him with some astonishment , for it was not usual for Shelby to express opinions of this kind to junior captains . " I sent for you because I 've something to say to you , " Shelby continued . " I 'm in hopes we 're through the worst of our march.  | You did a first-rate job as chief of scouts on the road up here , Bennett . Turned those Irregular Texas fellows into a not inefficientlittle corps , hey ? No , do n't thank me . It 's not a compliment , sir , it 's a plain statement of fact . None of your command left now , I understand , except those rapscallions , Janeicke and Gonder , who are more trouble to me than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think I 'll try to have anotherscout force formed . From now on , until we reach the capital , we should be able to proceed with ordinary advance guards and screening patrols , line companies taking turns at the duty . " He shot a keen glance out from under his eyebrows . " I 'll be frank , captain , " he said suddenly . " I had my doubts about you . But I believe I was wrong . " Back stiff , Clay stood looking straight ahead , not knowing what to reply . He felt somewhat indignant , like a small boy being lectured , but it was politic to keep silent . " So I 'm relieving you permanently from your post of excessiverisk as chief of scouts , " continued Shelby . " And I have one for you of even greater responsibility . The A.D.C. thing . In dealing with these French we 're going to have to put on more side than we 're accustomed to in our army . I need an aide de camp to accompany me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can trust to do as I tell him , just as I tell him . Captain Bennett , will you accept this post ? " Aide de camp to Shelby  --  what could Clay say ? It was the final proof that the general 's prejudices and distrust of him had vanished entirely , and that they were back on the old cordial footing . It meant opportunity and honor . All these things raced through Clay 's head , but he tried to sound as dignified , and reserved , and properly appreciative as possible . " I only hope , sir , I can discharge the duties satisfactorily to you . "  | " I 'll be the judge of that . Meantime , your duty begins this minute . Be so good as to present my compliments to Major Edwards and notify him to prepare to accompany me to call on General Jeanningros . You will attend also . Both of you be here within the hour . " The afternoon was lengthening when they were received by General Jeanningros , in the large stucco house which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his study as a Mexican servant admitted them , and bowed . " Be so kind as to enter my office , messieurs , " he said . He ushered them into a stiff military room , with maps on the walls , papers ranged in neat piles on the desk , one or two technical military books , and a portrait of Emperor Napoleon III , framed in a draped tricolor . " Now , " said Jeanningros , as soon as they were seated , with a directness remarkable in a Frenchman , " what is your purpose , general , in coming here ? " The question was sudden , but Shelby replied to it as bluntly and as frankly as it was asked . " I come to seek service under Maximilian . " " There are some things that need explaining . " " As what ? " " A former officer of yours was here some weeks ago . " " An officer of mine ? " " Tall , lean-faced , very dark  --  " " Parridine ! " cried Shelby . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine , General Jeanningros , " Shelby said after a moment 's silence . " But what of him ? " " He mentioned a certain transaction of yours with the Juarist rebels on the border . " " You refer to the guns , " said Shelby instantly . " I will ex- plain that . It was impossible to transport them over the desert and I needed provisions . So I traded them  --  for food . " " Nevertheless , it leaves the enemies of the emperor in possessionof six brass guns . This will be a grave matter for you to overcome . " " I do not fear it . The man you named  --  Parridine  --  would put the very worst possible face on this story to you . " " I have not swallowed his story at full value . " " Good ! " Shelby returned Jeanningros ' dry grin . The two had reached a footing of clean-grained mutual respect and liking . Jeanningros said he did not know where Parridine had gone . It was some weeks before that the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You do not know , then , that Parridine is now with the Juaristas ? " " Mais non ! " " He is an officer with El Gato  --  " " Satre ! And I had the opportunity to hang him ! " " That , general , is a privilege others of us would enjoy , " grinned Shelby . Then he became serious . " I do n't know what you think of things here , sir , " he said , coming crisply to the point , " but one thing is certain  --  you 've acted toward me like a man and a soldier , and I 'm not going to withhold the strictesttruth from you . You should know therefore that the Federalgovernment of the United States has no love for the occupationof Mexico by the French . If diplomacy ca n't get you out , you 'll likely see blue uniforms south of the Rio Grande . " " Perhaps we will have something to say about that , " said the Frenchman . " Perhaps . But will France fight ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to me that if Louis Napoleon had meant to be serious in this thing , he would long ago have formed an alliance with Jefferson Davis and the Confederacy . Better battles could havep369been fought on the Potomac than on the Rio Grande , and surer results gained from a French landing at Mobile than Tampico or Vera Cruz . We come to join the army of Maximilian in the event of this very invasion from the north . We know the Yankees , and let no man underestimate them . They fight like wolves . What do you think Marshal Bazaine will say ? " " I can not speak for Bazaine , " said Jeanningros slowly , " but I do not think he will be averse to enlisting your Americans . " " And what about Maximilian ? " " Ah , the Austrian ! You should see him to understand him . " Jeanningros leaned forward with sudden interest , his eyes fixed on Shelby 's face . " More of a scholar than a king , good at botany , a poet on occasions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saint over his wine , and a sinner among his cigars , in love with his wife , believing more in manifest destiny than drilled battalions , good Spaniard in all but deceit and treachery , honest , earnest , tender-hearted and sincere  --  his faith is too strong in the liars who surround him and his soul too pure for the deeds that must be done ! " He paused and took up a box of panatellas from the table , first offering them to each of his guests , and then lighting one himself . " The emperor can not kill as we Frenchmen do , " he resumed through a cloud of cigar smoke . " He knows nothing of diplomacy . In a nation of thieves and cutthroats he goes devoutly to mass , endows hospitals , laughs a good man 's laugh at the praises of the blanketed rabble , says his prayers , and sleeps the sleep of the gentleman and prince . Bah ! His days are numbered ; nor can all the power of France keep his crown upon his head  --  if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Jeanningros suddenly checked himself , as if he had gone too far . He looked from one to another of the Americans , then threw himself back in his chair , puffing rapidly at his cigar  | " Has he the confidence of Bazaine ? " asked Shelby , attempting to renew the surprising flow of frank and penetrating information . Jeanningros gave a shrug  --  one of the untranslatable shrugs of his race . " Le marechal , you mean . Oh , le marechal keeps his own secrets . Besides I have not seen la marechal since coming north . " And that was the end of the conversation . It was plain that General Jeanningros had vouchsafed all the information he was going to at this sitting.  |p371JO  SHELBY sat on a boulder , his knees apart and his forearmsresting on his thighs  --  the attitude of a weary man . Rain , persistently dripping from the trees above his head , made the cheerless night even more cheerless . Under the overhanging rock the fire sizzled and smoldered , and Shelby felt , rather than saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wet blackness . The overhanging rock was " headquarters . " Huddled under its scanty shelter were Major Edwards and Captain Bennett , enduring with Shelby the endlessdiscomfort of the night . In the darkness about him , the general heard the occasional noises made by men . Coughing . Moving about . Dreary cursing . His troopers had made their sodden bivouac in the center of this valley , and they were tired and cold . And growing more and more discouraged . No wonder , Shelby thought . It was a week and more since they left the comfort of the barracks at Monterrey , bidding farewell to General Jeanningros , and in its way the march up from Monterrey had been even more interminable than the march down from the border . For one thing , the hope that their troubles were over , and that they had at last reached a well-policed country , had early been disappointed . Before the Brigade reached Parras its advance guard had fought a skirmish with Mexican irregulars . A day later there was an affair of the outposts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , Shelby 's men felt aggrieved , as if they had been victims of a shoddy trick . They were beginning to weary of the threat by day and the constant peril that stalked by night  --  and Shelby did not blame them . No rest in these mountains . Here and there they had passed French garrisons . The French were great on bright uniforms and decorations . Zouaves , voltiguers , chasseurs , foot artillery  --  Shelby could not remember the catalogue of curious regimentals . Scarlets and blues and yellows . Baggy trousers and fezzes . Frogged jackets . Eye-filling , these French . And soldiers , too  --  if their European reputation could be accepted . Shelby knew the French had shown themselves able to fight  --  at Solferino , for instance . And Inkermann . And the Redan . Somehow , though , they did n't seem to know how to deal with the Mexicans . The French seemed actually afraid to move outside their posts , except in large force . Certainly they had been of no help to the Brigade . Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the men suffered from lack of water in the desert , they suffered from too much of it in the mountains . Night after night they had to sleep in soaked blankets under the incessant cold rain . Dr. Tisdale was battling new maladies  --  those coughs in the darkness were a danger sign . Pneumonia . Influenza . If the weather did n't change , the hospital list would be something to shudder over . Then there was the same old problem  --  supplies . No cooperationfrom the French . Suspicion , instead  --  even hostility , except in the case of Jeanningros . Shelby had been forced to reverse his policy . It had become absolutely necessary to let the men forage  --  either forage orP373starve . The Brigade was on the loose these days , but the pickingswere not good . The camp was hungry right now . Of course the inevitable occurred . Foraging meant skirmishes . The populace , as Shelby had foreseen , rose buzzing like swarms of angry bees in the Brigade 's wake . Some regrettable things happened  --  regrettable but unavoidable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurrence of the night before . A half dozen civilians , part of his own noncombatant train , had remained at Monterrey when he left , and then , belatedly , attempted to overtake him . They were waylaid in the darkness . To the Mexicanpeasant , the machete , a long , heavy knife , half-way between a sword and a meat cleaver , was the most natural weapon . When Shelby 's rear guard found the civilians , there was not much left to identify the corpses ; and the general had not been able to find it in his heart to blame his men when they wreaked bloody reprisals on the village near which the massacre occurred . But the people of the ruined village probably had nothing to do with the massacre of the Americans . And the aftermathleft another of the mounting causes for hatred against the Brigade . All this added to his problems , which showed no prospect of easing . Shelby could hear the voice of Major Edwards . Not even the discomfort of the cold rain could abate the major 's endless flow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a knowledge that had some claim to breadth and a full claim to romantics : " No other land , gentlemen , has had an awakening so storm begirt , or a christening so bloody and remorseless as Mexico . " Edwards puffed out his damp mustache and gazed about him with lustrous eye , like a lecturer on a platform . " First came the Spaniards under Cortez ; and next the revolution , wherein no man died peacefully or under the shade of a roof . " He paused and looked suspiciously at Shelby , who sat hunched by the fire with the beads of water gathering on his hat brim . The major cleared his throat . " Are you listening , general ? " " Yes , yes , John , " replied Shelby , with resignation . " Count the roll of Mexico 's leaders , " the major said sonorously , taking up the flow of his discourse instantly , when he was assured of his audience . " There was Hidalgo , the ferocious priest  --  shot . Morelos , with these words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , Thou knowest it ; if ill , to Thy infinite mercy I commend my soul '  --  shot . Leonardo Bravo , scorning to fly  --  shot . Nicholas Bravo , his son , who offered a thousand captives for his father 's life  --  shot . Matamoras  --  shot . Mina  --  shot . Guerrera  --  shot . Then came the republic , bloodier , bitterer , crueler . Victoria , its first president  --  shot . Mexia  --  shot . Pedraza  --  shot . Santmanet  --  shot by General Ampudia , who cut off his head , boiled it in oil , and stuck it up on a pole to blacken in the sun . Herrera  --  shot . Paredes  --  shot . All of them shot , these Mexican presidents , except Santa Anna , who sits today in Havana , among his game-cocks and his mistresess , an exile forever from Mexico ! " " In Christ 's name , John , you make a man 's flesh crawl ! " said Shelby . " What are you doing , making a collection of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delved a little , " began Edwards in injured tones , " into its history  --  " " There goes another president  --  shot , " said Clay Bennett . The flippancy had grim point . They all had heard the sound far up toward the head of the valley  --  a single , sharp report , echoing from the rocky walls . Shelby straightened up , his head cocked to one side . Edwards crouched forward intently . The silence remained absolute , save for the drip from the trees . " A jumpy sentry , " grunted Edwards at last , relaxing . In direct refutation , came another shot , followed by a quick , nervous sputter of reports .   " Damn ! " said Shelby . It was more a groan than a curse . He levered himself to his feet and stood listening . There were more shots , the rattle of a small volley . " Just wo n't let us rest , " he complained wearily . " The third straight night we 've been attacked . John , hunt up Collins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this ! Find Collins and tell him to support the upper picket at the head of the canyon . Bennett , accompany me . I 'm going to take a look at the lower end . No telling which way the cat may jump . " Cold rain pelted through the thin coat on Shelby 's back as he felt his way among the dripping rocks , followed by the captain , and he wetted himself to the crotch as he waded through some water-laden bushes . He was among the men before he knew it . Some were on their feet , shivering and restlessly movingabout ; most , however , wrapped in their soggy blankets , lay propped on elbows , listening to the shooting and swearing at the weather . " What company 's this ? " Through the gloom a dozen faces peered at him . " General Shelby ! Why , we did n't know , seh  --  " " Attention ! " barked a metal voice . Men scrambled out of their blankets to their feet . " What company 's this ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You boys come along with me . " Captain Bennett took charge of the detachment and got it into some sort of order . Followed by the dripping troopers , Shelby threaded his way along the edge of the valley toward the lower end , conscious of the cliffs rising blackly at his right . The firing at the head of the valley seemed to be increasing . " Sounds like them Mexicanos means business , " a soldier remarked . " Afteh the hosses again , " conjectured another . " We 've
