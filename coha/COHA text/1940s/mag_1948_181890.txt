" English cooking at its best is probably as good as any on earth . At its worst it drives men to murder and suicide . . . You were warned that the whole country is screwy . So what are you hollering about ? " <P> Thus in London 's Sunday Express last week , Columnist Nat Gubbins good-naturedly warned U.S. tourists in Britain . But U.S. trippers did not scare easily . Two months ago political worries had led some to cancel trips to Europe , but the defeat of Italy 's Communists had queued them up in longer lines than ever . Last week , for the first time since last fall , the Queen Elizabeth left New York City packed to the rails . This summer some 100,000 U.S. tourists will visit the United Kingdom and Eire ; twice as many hope to go to the Continent . <P> Shipping companies are already booked up solid for most of the summer . Airline bookings are ahead of last year . Both can ferry only 45,000 passengers a month ( 33,000 by sea , 12,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last week ship lines were still accepting tentative bookings-but only to replace last-minute no-shows . <P> No Room . Some of the European countries found that they had oversold their attractions . Sweden even bought ads in U.S. newspapers discouraging midsummer travel-its hotels were full . But most still had the welcome mat out . The Netherlands was advertising the Queen 's Golden Jubilee ; Belgium plugged two international fairs and the famed Belgian cuisine ; Norway touted its fjords ; Britain listed the Olympics , horse races and regattas ; Italy had an arm-long series of fairs and festivals from hot jazz to trapshooting . Europeans hoped that U.S. tourists would spend $300 million this year , twice as much as in 1947 . <P> In Britain , the overvalued pound made touring comparatively expensive . In London 's first-flight Dorchester Hotel , for example , a single room with bath cost $11 a night . Britain 's rationing system was also stricter than on the Continent , but the meals , plain though they might be , were reasonably priced ( the government had pegged them at $1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hotel prices ( about $4 a night ) lower . Britain 's best lures : dollar tourists could buy clothes and get enough gasoline to drive 600 miles in two weeks , 1,000 in four . <P> No Millionaires . France 's new free currency rate ( 305 francs to the dollar ) made traveling low-priced . Knickknacks-handbags , scarves , blouses and lingerie-were cheaper than in the U.S. And in Paris , as one tripper sighed ecstatically : " There seems to be an abundance of almost everything " - even if some things sold at inflationary prices . For night life , there were grubby clubs on Montmartre , dancers at the Bal Tabarin and undressed showgirls at the Folies-Bergre . <P> In the provinces , food was again more plentiful and prices were down . In Biarritz , at luxury hotels such as the Miramar , room &; board was about $8 a day . In smaller places a tourist could eat and sleep well for as little as $2 to $4 a day . All hotels had stern instructions from the government not to gouge U.S. tourists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no longer all millionaires . . . We will have to show them a good time at a reasonable price .
