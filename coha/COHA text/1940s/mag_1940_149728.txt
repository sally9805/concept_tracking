Best-known South American composer is Heitor Villa-Lobos , talkative , self-taught Brazilian , a man of tremendous energy who has written more than 1,400 pieces , and has said , " Better bad of mine than good of others . " Last week , in connection with a big show of paintings by Brazil 's Candido Portinari ( TIME , Aug. 12 ) , Manhattan 's enterprising Museum of Modern Art did up Brazil 's music in a package of six concerts . The Museum 's elegant audiences and radio listeners gathered that African thumps and easygoing Portuguese tunes were Brazil 's chief heritage . Wherever its music was going , Villa-Lobos was in the driver 's seat : most of the pieces , including some that were bad-better , were by him . <P> Most popular Brazilian musical form is the chro ( pronounced shoro , in which one instrument in an ensemble improvises on a theme , in about the same way that a U. S. jazz musician " takes a chorus " for a solo ride . Villa-Lobos has composed 14 choros , ranging from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Choros No. 10 , for chorus and orchestra . <P> At the final concerts Pianist Artur Rubinstein , an early admirer of Villa-Lobos. played apiece called Rudepema ( " Savage Poem " ) which Villa-Lobos had intended to be both a portrait of the pianist and the most difficult piano work ever composed . Whether or not its brilliantly wham-banging measures actually portrayed mild-looking Mr. Rubinstein , Rudepema sounded like a stumper for any virtuoso . <P> But the audience liked better the slinky , tuneful , banal choros and dances which were played by gourd-rattling Romeo Silva and his orchestra , familiar to many a visitor to the New York World 's Fair . It liked better still a tall , dark soprano , Elsie Houston , who in a green dress looked and sounded like some jungle bird . <P> Brazilian despite her name , Elsie Houston is a **31;5649;TOOLONG of the grandfather of Texas ' great Sam Houston . She studied singing in Europe , sang in nightspots , married a surrealist poet whose name she will not tell because he is anti-Nazi , and still in Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1938 , is currently at Manhattan 's Rainbow Room , where she performs voodoo songs by candlelight . At the Museum 's opening concert she went through her routine with a pair of candles which , by order of the fire department , were enclosed in chimneys . In the darkened house Elsie Houston was something to see as she slapped a tom-tom , crooned incantations to Brazil 's goddess Yemanga , to Ogum , the god of war , to Exu , the devil .
