By the time he was twelve , John Wilbert Glaefke was miserably self-conscious about his looks . Playmates , with childish cruelty , called him " big lips " and " bulldog . " In junior high , a teacher asked him in front of the class if he had any Negro blood . When he reached the age of wanting dates , the girls looked at him with frank distaste or fear and refused . <P> In time , John stopped playing with other kids and withdrew more &; more into himself . He stayed at home with his mother , brother and three sisters , who , he says , were " all good-looking . " After five weeks in the tenth grade , he left school and went to work at a series of jobs that could be done without showing his face much-in shipping rooms , basements and back rooms . <P> " Beat It . " At 23 , John got into trouble with the police for stealing a typewriter and a movie projector . At an " honor farm " of Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other prisoners avoided him : " I would walk up and watch them when they were playing cards . They let me stand there for awhile and then look up as if they were telling me to beat it . " He ran away from the farm , was caught stealing again and sent back to the reformatory . <P> By the time he was drafted in 1945 , John was more or less prepared for the way he was treated in the Army . Other soldiers were not interested in taking him along on parties . When he went out alone , girls , as usual , snubbed him . <P> Last year , out of the Army , John was arrested again for stealing . He told his life story to Cleveland 's Judge Frank <P> Merrick , who consulted probation officers , psychiatrists and a plastic surgeon . <P> John was given four operations , spread over eight months .

Last week John , at 32 , was looking much better , and feeling like another man . He was doing all right at his $38-a-week job in a small factory which makes household goods . Like a blind man with new-found sight , he was discovering the normal give &; take relationships between normal people . Little things like the good-natured kidding of fellow workers were strange and exciting . He now enjoys meeting people , has made some friends , but has still made no dates with girls . With one or more operations to go , John says : " I 'm still no Adonis . But I like the way people treat me. "
