Back in the 1930s when Eleanor Roosevelt first went on the air , her high-pitched , uncertain voice " and the piffling quality of some of her remarks made a field day for mimics . Last week , with the able assistance of her daughter Anna , Mrs. Roosevelt returned to the air with a new program , and a new radio personality .
