txt Suggested to the Treasury When compiling their tax returns for 1943 a number of people f iund that Victory , plus income tax deductions fox that year , exceeded the total of their actual indebtedness to the Treasury Department . Many of those people requested refunds , but many have not as yet been reimbursed . Now , with another bond drive on , this might be a good time for the Treasury Department to offer to trade in bonds for certified affidavits or taxpayers ' drafts for the various sums still unrefunded . December would be a good time to make these exchanges through the taxpayers ' local collectors . A good many petty cash or stamp adjustment might be avoided if people entitled to refunds were given a choice of adding as much cash to their overpayments as would be required to receive new bonds only .
