The Battle for Buna , which many observers had thought would be a pushover , was developing last week into a major struggle for control of New Guinea . It was being fought as fiercely as any battle on Guadalcanal . Allied casualties , mostly wounded , mounted steadily and piles of Jap corpses rotted in the jungles , in the swamps and on the beaches . <P> Buna village had been taken , but Buna Mission , one mile to the west , had not fallen . Nor had the center of the snake-like line between captured Buna and captured Gona . The Japs were so well supplied and had dug in so strongly that they had to be dug out almost man by man . As one correspondent put it : " Destroy your opinions of this as a little side show . The numbers of men involved and the strategic importance of the objectives are relative things anyhow . Nowhere in the world today are American soldiers engaged in fighting so desperate , so merciless , so bitter , or so bloody . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
