Under a screen of heavy rains and thick fogs , the German Army pushed deep into Belgium . It was too much for blood &; guts alone . <P> Last week came news that hard-riding Lieut . General George S. Patton Jr. , in his moment of need , had put aside his pearl-handled pistols , taken up a pen , and appealed to a Higher Authority . Wrote he : " Almighty and most merciful Father , we humbly beseech Thee . . . to restrain these immoderate rains . . .. Grant us fair weather for battle . Graciously hearken to us as soldiers who call upon Thee that , armed with Thy power , we may advance from victory to victory . . . and establish Thy justice among men and nations . Amen . " <P> Patton 's prayer was answered . The skies cleared , the Ninth Air Force and the tanks came out , and the German offensive was stopped . <P> God Speed the Plough <P> Along the lanes and highroads , past the bare beech forests and the smooth slopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afoot and in wagons , they converged on Chichester Cathedral , whose distant spire was a grey needle against the sea . They filed into the famed early Norman church , packed it to the doors , and waited self-consciously . For the first time in 300 years , the British festival of Plough Monday was being celebrated . <P> Eight farmers in white milking coats carried a red , blue and silver plough down the nave , laid it at the chancel steps and knelt around it . Then another farmer gave thanks for God 's gifts while the congregation joined him in repeating the last three words of each sentence : " The rich soil , the smell of the fresh-turned earth-come from God . . . . The beauty of a clean-cut furrow , the sweep of a well-ploughed field - come from God . " <P> At the end of the service , a Sussex ploughman asked Dr. George K. A. Bell , Bishop of Chichester , to bless the plough , " the sign of all our labor in the countryside . " The Bishop , wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand over the plough and the kneeling farmers : " God speed the plough : the beam and the mouldboard , the slade and the sidecap , the share and the coulters . . . in fair weather and foul , in success and disappointment , in rain and wind , or in frost and sunshine . God speed the plough . " <P> Plough Monday is the first Monday after Twelfth-night ( Epiphany ) . Traditionally , this is the first day of the farmer 's year , when the ground has thawed enough for a share to cut cleanly through the turf . The event , the origin of which is obscure , gradually came to be celebrated as a British religious festival . By the 17th Century , observance of the day had ended : instead of going to church the ploughmen celebrated by getting drunk on sack . <P> Immoderate Moderator <P> When the Presbyterian Church , U.S.A. elected its new moderator ( an annual affair ) last May , many of its 2,090,000 members knew very little about the new incumbent . Dr. Roy Ewing Vale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a reputation for somewhat meek piety . <P> Last week Moderator Vale had not only Presbyterians but many other Protestants goggle-eyed . Turning from lamb into lion , he had begun a slam-bang crusade against the Roman Catholic Church . For ten weeks he will speak two or three times a day in major cities , repeating the ominous words he uttered in Dallas last week :
