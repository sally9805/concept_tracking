ANEW $35,000,000 industry which boasts it is saving a total of $50,000 a day for 1,250,000 American families is one of the good things that the country got out of the late unlamented Depression . It is the coldstorage-locker system for preserving foods , the invention of a group of financially hardpressed but bravely imaginative farmers of the Pacific Northwest , who saw no reason why they should continue forever to sell their livestock and their crops at rock-bottom at slaughtering and harvest time , only to buy the same goods back as food at four or five times the price a few months later . There were practically no locker plants in 1933 , but there are 3,200 of them now . Fifty more are being built every month . They range in size from plants of 50 lockers , to plants of 2,000 . Each locker holds about 200 pounds of foodstuffs . It is estimated that each locker saves its renter from $30 to $100 a year in food costs . The locker plants are cold-storage plants in which food is first " quick-frozen " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then stored at a steady temperature of from zero to 15 above zero until needed . The quick-freezing process is the secret o : the plants ' success . Frost , which is a slowfrozen formation , destroys vegetables an fruits , making them watery and tasteless and ruining their firmness of texture , while quick-freezing not only avoids injury to the food but in the case of peas and spinach actually improves their color and texture . Ti. - reason is that when freezing occurs slowly ice crystals form inside the cells of the fruit or vegetable and continue to grow , sending out needlelike points , until finally the ce : . walls are pierced and the vital juices drain out . With " quick freezing " the sudden plunge to extreme cold causes only minute ice crystals to form and the cell walls remain intact .  | Users of the lockers store away large quantities of beef , pork , and wild game in January , February , and March ; sea foods in March and April ; peas , asparagus , strawberries , and other early fruits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the calendar as various foods come in season . Keeping the foods until needed , the locker renters have fresh corn on the cob and strawberry shortcake at Christmas , snap beans at Easter , and ripe peaches during the spring thaw . Besides providing out-ofseason luxuries such as these , the lockers have given many of their users the less spectacular but  | far more important blessing of a year-round balanced diet , often for the first time . Although several cold-storage methods had been tried before , the use of the locker plants really got under way around Sioux City , Iowa , in about 1933 . The Middle West took quickly to the idea . Lately the South has taken it up with enthusiasm , leaving only the Atlantic seaboard comparatively undeveloped . Promoters of the locker plants say that a family of five can save as much as $130 a year on its meat bill alone . Figuring that the family would normally buy 1,000 pounds of meat at a retail price of 29 cents a pound , the promoters say the family can cut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bulk at 14 cents a pound , paying $10 to have it butchered , cut , wrapped , and frozen , and $10 for the rental of a locker for a year . Knowledge about the quick-freezing and care of foods has developed rapidly with the rise of the movement . Fresh-killed carcasses now undergo a series of carefully prescribed treatments . Each of the locker plants is a miniature packing plant , and at most of them butchering , cutting , grinding , sausage making , pickling , smoking , and other methods of preparing meats are done by a full-time butcher . When carcasses are brought to a plant by locker users , the plant attendants hang them up in chilling and aging rooms for a time , where the body heat is permitted to escape completely in air at 33 degrees F. , to ripen the meat and make it tender . After aging , the meat is cut into chopsteaks , and roasts , ground into hamburgers or sausages , or cured according to the oweer 's instructions . The cuts are wrapped in moistureproof parchment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid discoloration and dehydration would occur . The meat is then subjected to the quick-freezing process , remaining at ten degrees below zero for from 12 to 24 hours . The packages are now ready for the locker . With the exception of the vegetables that can be eaten raw , such as celery , lettuce ,  | radishes , onions , and cucumbers , and pears , almost every other kind of fruit and vegetable can be frozen successfully . Like the meats , the vegetables and fruits have to be prepared for storage . It is impossible to store any vegetables satisfactorily unless they are first well blanched ( scalded ) , it was found . They are placed in water near the boiling point for from 30 seconds to seven minutes . This arrests the action of ferments , sets the natural color of the product , and makes packing easier . Fish , too , need special care . They are first frozen and then dipped in cold water . This forms a protective glaze of ice which prevents shrinkage . Wrapped in moistureproof paper , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ten degrees above zero have usually been held , but there is a trend now to temperatures as cold as zero . Enzymic and bacterial action are greatly slowed at 15 degrees above , it has been found , but it is not until zero has been reached that these actions are completely dormant . When the food is taken out of storage the fruits and vegetables are used immediately on thawing , as the frozen foods are not sterile . And contrary to early beliefs , no foods may be thus stored for longer than a year ; few for that long . The locker patron walks into the cold locker room in 99 percent of the plants . Some people object to exposing themselves to the cold , while others suffer from claustrophobia when the door of the locker room is shut behind them to avoid warming the chamber . To meet objections of this sort , Roy W. Smith , of Newark , Ohio , invented a locker room now known as the " Polar Chest . " With this type the patron remains at all times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tops form the floor of the room entered by the patron . With a small 1 ? - horsepower crane , the patron pulls his locker up out of the floor . This room makes good use of the principle that cold air is heavier than warm . The cold air hangs down in the pit when a chest is raised , whereas it spills out every time the door of one of the walk-in types is opened . Another development is the " Polar Wheel , " with the lockers mounted on a huge wheel . The patron dials for his locker , the wheel swings until the locker faces a door . The patron opens the two doors and can take what he wants from his locker without entering any chamber . Experts in the locker-plant field estimate that the country could make use of 14,469 of the plants . The greatest proportionate increase in present facilities would be in the East , with New York going up from six plants at present to 1,282 , and Pennsylvania going from its present 33 to 980.  |     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
