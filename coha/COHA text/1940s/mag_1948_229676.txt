For once the British were not the villains of the piece . And , with their favorite bait removed from the ring , most Irishmen were at a loss to tell what the fight was about at all . " This , " wrote the Dublin correspondent of London 's News Chronicle , as 1,800,000 Irishmen prepared to go to the polls this week , " is the strangest general election that ever took place . Nobody wants it . Nobody knows what it 's about , and nobody , except the candidates , seems to care how it will end . " <P> " Better a Dev You Know . . . " In a sense , you might say , it was a private fight between young ( 43 ) , clever , soft-spoken Sean MacBride , whose Clann na Poblachta ( Republican Party ) had successfully challenged the government in last fall 's by-elections ( TIME , Dec. 1 ) , and old Dev himself . Young Sean , whose early life had been spent in the outlawed Irish Republican Army and whose father had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-Britishism , but he was vaguely against Dev 's policy of keeping Eire in the British pound sterling zone . <P> De Valera , whose Fianna Fail had grown lazy and complacent in 16 years of uninterrupted rule , seemed to be merely against MacBride . " If you do n't return me , " he told the voters , " Eire faces disaster . " But he had little to promise on his own account . " Better a Dev you know than a devil you do n't , " was the best slogan Fianna members could think up . <P> Place Your Bets . The opposition 's reply to this was a unified cry of " Anything you can do , we can do better . " But beyond that there seemed little chance of agreement between the parties opposing Dev . Clann workers scrawled " Is your trip really necessary ? " on posters showing a De Valera rampant with the Fianna slogan , " We are ready to resume the advance . " But with equal enthusiasm Laborite heelers amended MacBride posters proclaiming " A New Deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same old pack . " <P> General Richard Mulcahy 's once fiery Fine Gael , the last vestige of the Cosgrave government that preceded Dev , had the best electioneering machine ( including a company of blue-kilted girl pipers that took Dublin by storm ) . But-as one of their critics said- " the undertaker 's union is working against Fine Gael . " Three of their aged front-bench deputies had died during the campaign . And nobody expected much of the Laborites , the fourth party . <P> There were some independents to swell the anti-De Valera ranks : irreverent , foxy Shopkeeper James Dillon , whose only program for years had been to heckle Dev from the floor of the Dail , and a certain bonesetter who asked re-election on the grounds that he mended all limbs gratis regardless of party affiliation . But the best the combined opposition could hope for seemed to be reducing Dev 's majority to a mere plurality , and further confound an increasingly confused government . In that case Dev , who refused to consider joining a coalition , might resign , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so slight that another general election would undoubtedly follow promptly .
