GRENADINE ETCHING ( 270 pp. ) - Robert C. Ruark-Doubleday ( $2.75 ) . <P> <P> Grenadine Etching is a lampoon on the big-bosomed heroines of lending-library historical fiction-seemingly a sure-fire subject . The author , a Scripps-Howard columnist , must have thought so , because he did n't work hard enough at it . <P> Grenadine 's father was believed to be " the bastard son of an English King who had despoiled a Scottish maid between the act of shooting grouse and angling for landlocked salmon . " Grenadine , herself part Negro with Creole trimmings , grows up with a gorilla for a playmate ; her first word , at seven months , is " man . " She marries the governor of Havana , then becomes a slave trader , millionaire racehorse owner , inventor of the cigaret and , after the first 100 pages , dull to read about . Merely exaggerating the absurd is no sure way to hilarity ; satire must make its own kind of sense and this makes little or none . Readers will admire Ruark 's choice of target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
