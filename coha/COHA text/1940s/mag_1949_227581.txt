Admiring the " good grammar " of a cricket player 's batting , the Manchester Guardian 's scholarly Neville Cardus once called the batsman , a Lancashireman named Watson , " the Samuel Johnson of cricket . " Demanded outraged Cricketer Watson : " Who did this bloke Johnson play for ? " <P> Players are often baffled by the allusions that Neville Cardus , who usually lugs a good book along to the cricket field , chips into his cameo-chiseled reports on Britain 's national game . Slight , myopic Cardus is probably the world 's only cricket critic who also doubles in brass and woodwinds as a music reviewer . For 30 years , in covering his " strange dichotomy , " first for the Guardian and now for the Kemsley newspapers ( the Sunday Times , the Sunday Chronicle ) , Cardus has played a deft prose symphony of his own that weaves through both his fields the tonal majesty of one , the rhythmic action of the other . The result bewitches more readers than it baffles . <P> Last week Cardus fans all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A new anthology , The Essential Neville Cardus ( Jonathan Cape ; 12 s. 6 d. ) , was selling at the impressive rate of 1,000 copies a week . <P> <P> Fresh Flavors . In one of the book 's 45 essays , Cardus compares Dr. W. G. Grace , the bearded , burly Babe Ruth of cricket who scored 54,986 runs in 43 years , to Prime Minister Gladstone , Violinist Fritz Kreisler , Bach and Falstaff ; he surmises that even the champion 's name was foreordained ( " Could Grace conceivably have played like Grace , known as W. G. Blenkinsop ? " ) . <P> Of Frank Woolley of Kent , another of the game 's immortals , Cardus writes : " His cricket is compounded of soft airs and fresh flavors . The bloom of the year is on it and the very brevity of summer is in it ... Woolley , so the statisticians tell us , often plays a long innings . But time 's a cheat . . . The brevity in Woolley 's batting is a thing of pulse and spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be apprehended by imagination . He is always about to lose his wicket ; his runs are thin-spun ... An innings by him is almost too unsubstantial for this world . " <P> Reviewing Cardus , the Guardian was moved to a flattering comparison : " Where would Homer 's gods and heroes ... be without Homer , now ? " <P> Musical Kidneys . Cricket 's Homer , a self-described bastard , was born 54 years ago in a Manchester slum . His buxom mother and her two sisters took in laundry until they learned that taking lovers was more rewarding ; Neville was one of the rewards . His father , whom he never knew , was first violinist in an orchestra . <P> Imaginative , sensitive , scarecrow-thin Neville had only four years of school , " a place of darkness and inhumanity . " The public library was his university : " I discovered Charles Dickens and went crazy . I read at meals . I read under the street lamps . I read myself to acute myopia .
