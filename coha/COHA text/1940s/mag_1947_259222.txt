Since his retirement as Secretary of War in September 1945 , Henry Lewis Stimson has been living quietly at his West Hills , L. I. estate , reading , writing up his diary and reflecting on his long years of public service . <P> This week probably the most important chapter of that long career came from Stimson 's pen , published in Harper 's Magazine under the title The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb . In it Stimson disclosed that : 1 ) he , more than any other man , was responsible for the decision to wipe out Hiroshima and Nagasaki ; 2 ) the two bombs dropped were the only ones which the U.S. had in store at the time . He made the record explicit and complete . <P> <P> Legitimate Weapon . In the fall of 1941 the question of atomic energy first came to his attention when President Roosevelt appointed him to a committee on atomic policy . In May 1943 , Stimson was made directly responsible to the President for the administration of the entire project . <P> " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever hear it suggested by the President , or by any other responsible member of our Government , that atomic energy should not be used in the war . " It was considered to be " as legitimate as any other of the deadly explosive weapons of modern war . " <P> Morals &; Techniques . Stimson and Roosevelt discussed the matter on March 15 , 1945 . That was their last conference . The next time Stimson went to the White House he went to explain the whole titanic undertaking to a man " whose only previous knowledge of our activities was that of a Senator who had loyally accepted our assurance that the matter must be kept a secret from him . " <P> " Within four months , " Stimson informed President Truman , " we shall in all probability have completed the most terrible weapon ever known in human history . . . . " <P> An interim committee with a panel of four scientists was set up to keep the President advised . On June 1 the committee resolved that 1 ) " the bomb should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) used on a dual target-that is , a military installation or war plant surrounded by or adjacent to houses and other buildings most susceptible to damage , 3 ) used without prior warning . " <P> The committee considered giving the Japanese a demonstration " in some uninhabited area " in the hopes of frightening them out of the war . The idea was rejected . The demonstration might be a dud . " Nothing would have been more damaging to our effort to obtain surrender . " The scientists agreed : " We see no acceptable alternative to direct military use . " <P> " Psychological Weapon . " Henry Stimson searched his soul . <P> Japan " must be administered a tremendous shock . " Otherwise , " only the complete destruction of her military power could open the way to lasting peace . " He compiled a tally of debits and credits in property and in human relationships and human lives : <P> The Allies were faced with the task of destroying an armed force of 5,000,000 men and 5,000 suicide aircraft . Without the atomic bombs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed to a Japanese invasion . " Operations might be expected to cost over a million casualties to American forces alone . . . . Enemy casualties would be much larger . "
