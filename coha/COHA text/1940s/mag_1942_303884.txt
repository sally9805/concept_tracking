New York Central common sold down to an alltime low of 6 ? last week-just a few cents above its current earnings rate of $6 a share . Central has not paid a dividend since its $6 disbursement in 1931 , and in the intervening years 1932-41 has earned a grand total of only $5,900,000 . <P> But in the meantime it has cleaned off some $140,000,000 on its debt , mostly out of its $18,000,000-a-year depreciation reserve . It has promised to consider dividend resumption before the end of 1942.
