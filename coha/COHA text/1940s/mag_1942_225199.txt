Stalingrad was no longer a city . It was a place on the Volga , an expanse of rubbled homes and buildings , heaping corpses , tanks . The battle for Stalingrad was no longer a battle for that place alone . The Russians , widening their counter-attacks above and below the site where Stalin 's city once stood , now saw the struggle on the Volga " as the center of gravity of the summer campaign . " Stalingrad , they said , was no longer a separate segment of the Volga line , but a part of " general combat " from Leningrad to the Caucasus . <P> Dispatches to Moscow newspapers reported more gains than setbacks . But the official communiqus were rigidly cautious , almost foreboding in their restraint as the battle entered its seventh week . Slowly , at terrible cost , the Germans were closing upon the center of gravity . <P> Farther south the news was similar . In the Caucasus the Russians halted the Germans here &; there , wiped out 8.000 Rumanians in one battle below Novorossiisk , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Black Sea coast and toward the Grozny oil fields . <P> If the Russians were cautious and apprehensive , the German propagandists were definitely unhappy . Having announced the imminent fall of Stalingrad in early September , they did not know what to say last week . So they said less and less . Into their broadcasts crept a familiar note of uncertainty , evasion , desperation . It was the same note which so shook the morale of the German people last year , warning them that their victories of the summer and fall were not victory over the Red Army and Russia .
