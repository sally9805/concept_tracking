txt Urgently in need of new sources of revenue , more Massachusetts assessors are beginning to enforce existing tax laws on household effects . This development is evident in the last five annual reports of the State Department of Corporations and Taxation , officials of . he department disclosed . It is being greeted by owners of tangible personal property  --  both apartment house tenants and home owners  --  with mixed surprise and vexation . Possible Action In the future , it could lead in any one of these directions : 1 . Still wider use of the personal property tax in areas where it- is overlooked customarily . 2 . Renewed attempts to eliminate the tax as " vestigial and often inequitable . " 3 . Support of legislation designed to classify personal property and tax it at a flat statewide rate . Until recent years , Bay State assessors have , as a rule , confined their enforcement of the personal property tax to certain taxable tangible property of corporations , principally that of public service corporations . Taxes on household effects were regarded as difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Changing This view is changing and furniture and household equipment , less a $1,000 exemption when requested , are being subject to assessment in more localities , especially towns . For examples , a person owning 13,000 worth of household . effects in a community with a property tax rate of $40 a $1,000 assessed valuation would have to pay $80 yearly , assuming the $1,000 exemption request was made . Reports on personal property assessments since 1943 " show that assessors are going after " personal property taxes , Edward C. Wilson , deputy commissioner of corporations and taxation , explained . Assessors no longer are reluctant to tap this neglected source of municipal funds , he pointed out . Staggering costs of local government were said to be the cause of what appears to be a trend . Figures Tell Story The following figures tell the story : assessments of personal property totaled about $541,000 , - 000 in 1943 ; $554,000,000 in 1944 ; $592,000,000 in 1945 ; $604,000,000 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner . in 1946 ; and $625,000,000 in 1947 . This , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent , several percentage points higher than the rise in real estate assessments over the same period of years . Furthermore , Mr. Wilson said , 1948 probably will see a continuation of this trend . Under the present law , assessors are technically duty-bound to tax household effects , ' allowing a $1,000 exemption when specifically requested . However , there has been widespread disregard of the law until recent signs of interest in new revenue sources . The Department of Corporations and Taxation has attempted to clarify the situation . It has urged past legislatures to establish flat , statewide rates for different types of personal property . Fair Classification Such a schedule would correspond , in method , to the classification used in income taxing . Thus , the same type of personal property . would not be taxed dif ferently even though community property tax rates vary . The Massachusetts Federation of Taxpayers Associations adopts another view . It is opposed to the personal property tax as having a questionable base for taxation . This view was upheld in the 1945 report of the special legislative commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission . stated " the best way to clarify the statute in order to resolve the doubts which now arise concerning their meaning , would be to redefine the properties of public utilities as real estate : and  --  to the extent that the constitution will permit  --  to eliminate completely the vestigial and often inequitable remnants of the personal property tax . , . " Corporations Hit It was pointed out that in 1940 taxes on the personal property of public service corporations " represented slightly more than two thirds of all the personal estate entered on the rolls in that year . " The remainder was said to be divided among taxes on machinery belonging to corporations not engaged in manufacture , and to individuals whether engaged in manufacture or not , stocks in trade of unincorporated businesses , live stock , and household effects .
