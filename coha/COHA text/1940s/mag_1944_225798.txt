LAND I HAVE CHOSEN-Ellin Berlin-Doubleday Doran ( $2.50 ) . <P> By any standard , Land I Have Chosen is a remarkable first novel . It is remarkable for : 1 ) its plot , a rigorous , old-fashioned narrative with beginning , middle and end ; 2 ) its portrait of Anne Brooke , a well-meaning , attractive girl who begins as a Long Island debutante , ends as a Nazi sympathizer . But the book 's chief interest is that it is the work of Mrs. Irving Berlin . <P> The Story . In 1928 , at Southampton , L.I. , Anne was in her element . She wore a short white dress , drove a blue car with red wheels , went to all the parties , sang , danced , shivered at the thought of growing old , and struggled with the great problem of her life : should she marry Paul Craven ? <P> Nephew and heir of a fabulously wealthy speculator , Paul was handsome , broad-shouldered , faithful , devoted to Anne . At ler first girlhood dances he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their first dinner jackets . Anne intended to marry Paul , but would not set a date , and when he left for Chicago on business-warning her not to have a last fling in his absence-she was half relieved to see him go . <P> She should have listened to him . Under the surface of Southampton talk about Al Smith , the Ku Klux Klan , prohibition , life was more like the life of Tsarist Russia than any debutante could understand . In Paul 's absence , Anne fell in love with Marco Ghiberti , a mysterious Italian visitor ( Southampton had just recovered from the visits of Lindbergh and the Prince of Wales ) who was rumored to be nobility . It was a joke . Marco was a Harvard law student whose father had run a restaurant in Italy . Nothing spoiled the joke except that Anne had promised to marry Marco . <P> When the story got around , the girls passing Anne and Marco hummed I Ca n't Give You Anything but Love , Baby . Scraps of conversation from adjoining tables reached them : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prince turned out to be a soda clerk . . . . " Anne broke down , sent Marco away , married Paul . <P> The remainder of Land I Have Chosen is the story of Anne 's disintegration . With a hidden satisfaction she found herself watching the great fortunes crash in the Depression , was ashamed of herself for not feeling sorry . Presently she was no longer ashamed of herself . Running parallel with the story of Anne is the life of Lisa Blessing , a German actress who accepts the U.S. as Anne , in the end , accepts Nazi Germany . <P> Less well done , Lisa 's story complicates the book , blurs its outlines , is tiresome reading compared with the vivid scenes of life &; death on the Southampton beachhead . Readers are likely to forget the long talks about politics . They will remember Anne 's shock at seeing Marco at her best friend 's wedding , the families crowding together in poverty after the suicides and heart failures of the crash . When rich Uncle Bruce Craven went broke , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer on the other side . When Uncle Bruce asked his friends how his trial was going , somebody handed him a package . It contained a revolver and a note : " This is the gun that Albert used . "
