Time &; again since the defense program got under way , Washington has promised to protect the rights of Labor . The National Defense Advisory Commission set forth a fixed policy in the letting of contracts : " All work carried on as part of the defense program should comply with Federal statutory provisions affecting labor . . . . " The War &; Navy Departments agreed , and Labor 's great friend Franklin Roosevelt advised manufacturers not to forget it . <P> Last week promises and practical realities met head on , leaving Mr. Roosevelt dangling on the horns of a dilemma . <P> Start of the trouble was a long-standing feud between Eugene Grace 's Bethlehem Steel Corp . ( which has a well-known record of antiunionism ) and C. I. O. 's Steel Workers Organizing Committee . S. W. O. C. listed eleven grievances against Bethlehem . One of them was that Bethlehem stubbornly refused to comply with an order issued by the National Labor Relations Board to disband an alleged " company union . " Ominously S. W. O. C. voted its officers full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry up and comply . C. I. O. head John L. Lewis pointed out that Bethlehem had more than $1.000,000,000 worth of Government contracts . What about Mr. Roosevelt 's promises to Labor ? <P> The Defense Commission asked Attorney General Jackson for his legal opinion . To Mr. Jackson it was " too clear to admit of controversy " that all Government agencies were bound by NLRB decisions , until the courts saw fit to reverse those decisions . <P> The opinion mollified S. W. O. C. and John Lewis , spread joy among Labor . In other quarters it was a bombshell . NLRB had cracked down not only on Bethlehem but on many another firm which subsequently had been awarded defense contracts . Was a part of the defense program going to be held up until the courts ironed out NLRB decisions ? Congressmen roared that the Jackson ruling sabotaged the whole defense program . Cried New York 's Representative Taber : " If a Republican had delivered such a ruling he would have been called a ' fifth columnist ' by the gentleman in the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigs we must burn down a barn ; to strengthen the Wagner Act we must weaken the National Defense . " <P> Next day , Mr. Jackson hastened to add that he did not believe contracts already made would be affected . He followed that one up by adding that his opinion had been misconstrued , declared : " . . . I have not been asked for any opinion as to whether violators should or should not be awarded contracts . " It was merely , said he enigmatically , a ruling on an administrative matter . <P> In the midst of the hullabaloo , unofficial word came from the Defense Commission that National Defense requirements would be held paramount to all other considerations . <P> C. I. 0. , chagrined , debated what to do next at Bethlehem . Mr. Roosevelt had to decide whether to jeopardize his Labor support or his politically potent defense program-or whether there was some other way out . At week 's end he still kept dilemma-mum.                  @ @ @
