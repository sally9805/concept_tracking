the high windowhave some very nasty friends . " I was still holding the folded check by one corner down between my knees . I got my wallet out and put it away and stood up , reaching my hat off the floor . " I like them nasty , " I said . " The nasty ones have very simple minds . I 'll report to you when there is anything to report , Mrs. Murdock . I think I 'll tackle this coin dealer first . He sounds like a lead . " She let me get to the door before she growled at my back : " You do n't like me very well , do you ? " I turned to grin back at her with my hand on the knob . " Does anybody ? " She threw her head back and opened her mouth wide and roared with laughter . In the middle of the laughter I opened the door and went out and shut the door on the rough mannishsound .

She screwed her head around and looked up at me with tear-stained eyes . I shut the door and went over beside her and put an arm around her thin shoulders . " Cheer up , " I said . " You ought to feel sorry for her . She thinks she 's tough and she 's breaking her back trying to live up to it . " The little girl jumped erect , away from my arm . " Do n't touch me , " she said breathlessly . " Please . I never let men touch me . And do n't say such awful things about Mrs. Mur-dock . " Iler face was all pink and wet from tears . Without her glasses her eyes were very lovely. the high window 21I stuck my long-waiting cigarette into my mouth and lit it . " I  --  I did n't mean to be rude , " she snuffled . " But she does humiliate me so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " She snuffled some more and got a man 's handkerchief out of her desk and shook it out and wiped her eyes with it . I saw on the hanging down corner the initials L.M. embroidered in purple . I stared at it and blew cigarette smoke towards the corner of the room , away from her hair . " Is there something you want ? " she asked . " I want the license number of Mrs. Leslie Murdock 's car . " " It 's 2X1111 , a gray Mercury convertible , 1940 model . " " She told me it was a coupe . " " That 's Mr. Leslie 's car . They 're the same make and year and color . Linda did n't take the car . " " Oh . What do you know about a Miss Lois Magic ? " " I only saw her once . She used to share an apartment with Linda . She came here with a Mr.  --  a Mr. Vannier . " " Who 's he ? " She looked down at her desk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know him .

" " I can believe that , " she said tartly . " Know where Miss Magic lives ? " She shook her head , no . She folded the big handkerchief22 the high windowvery carefully and put it in the drawer of her desk , the one where the gun was . " You can swipe another one when that 's dirty , " I said . She leaned back in her chair and put her small neat hands on her desk and looked at me levelly . " I would n't carry that tough-guy manner too far , if I were you , Mr. Marlowe . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No . And I ca n't answer any more questions without specificinstructions . My position here is very confidential . " " I 'm not tough , " I said . " Just virile . " She picked up a pencil and made a mark on a pad . She smiled faintly up at me , all composure again . " Perhaps I do n't like virile men , " she said . " You 're a screwball , " I said , " if ever I met one . Good-by . " I went out of her office , shut the door firmly , and walked back along the empty halls through the big silent sunken funereal living room and out of the front door . The sun danced on the warm lawn outside . I put my dark glasses on and went over and patted the little Negro on the head again . " Brother , it 's even worse than I expected , " I told him . The stumble-stones were hot through the soles of my shoes . I got into the car and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small sand-colored coupe pulled away from the curb behind me . I did n't think anything of it . The man driving it wore a dark porkpie type straw hat with a gay print band and dark glasses were over his eyes , as over mine . I drove back towards the city . A dozen blocks later at a traffic stop , the sand-colored coupe was still behind me . I shrugged and just for the fun of it circled a few blocks . Thethe high window 23coupe held its position . I swung into a street lined with immensepepper trees , dragged my heap around in a fast Uturnand stopped against the curbing . The coupe came carefully around the corner . The blond head under the cocoa straw hat with the tropical print band did n't even turn my way . The coupe sailed on and I drove back to the Arroyo Seco and on towards Hollywood . I looked carefully several times , but I did n't spot the coupe again. 3I had an office in the Cahuenga Building , sixth floor , two small rooms at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ client to sit in , if I had a patient client . There was a buzzer on the door which I could switch on and off from my private thinkingparlor . I looked into the reception room . It was empty of everything but the smell of dust . I threw up another window , unlocked the communicating door and went into the room beyond . Three hard chairs and a swivel chair , flat desk with a glass top , five green filing cases , three of them full of nothing , a calendar and a framed license bond on the wall , a phone , a washbowl in a stained wood cupboard , a hatrack , a carpet that was just something on the floor , and two open windows with net curtains that puckered in and out like the lips of a toothless old man sleeping . The same stuff I had had last year , and the year before that . Not beautiful , not gay , but better than a tent on the beach . I hung my hat and coat on the hatrack , washed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hoisted the24 the high windowphone book onto the desk . Elisha Morningstar was listed at 824 Belfont Building , 422 West Ninth Street . I wrote that down and the phone number that went with it and had my hand on the instrument when I remembered that I had n't switched on the buzzer for the reception room . I reached over the side of the desk and clicked it on and caught it right in stride . Somebody had just opened the door of the outer office . I turned my pad face down on the desk and went over to see who it was . It was a slim tall self-satisfied looking numberin a tropical worsted suit of slate blue , black and white shoes , a dull ivory-colored shirt and a tie and display handkerchiefthe color of jacaranda bloom . He was holding a long black cigarette-holder in a peeled back white pigskin glove and he was wrinkling his nose at the dead magazines on the library table and the chairs and the rusty floor coveringand the general air of not much money being made . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stared at me out of a pair of rather dreamy pale eyes set close to a narrow nose . His skin was sun-flushed , his reddish hair was brushed back hard over a narrow skull , and the thin line of his mustache was much redder than his hair . He looked me over without haste and without much pleasure . He blew some smoke delicately and spoke through it with a faint sneer . " You 're Marlowe ? " I nodded . " I 'm a little disappointed , " he said . " I rather expected something with dirty fingernails . " " Come inside , " I said , " and you can be witty sitting down . " I held the door for him and he strolled past me flickingthe high window 25cigarette ash on the floor with the middle nail of his free hand . He sat down on the customer 's side of the desk , took off the glove from his right hand and folded this with the other already off and laid them on the desk . He tapped the cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal with a match until it stopped smoking , fitted another cigarette and lit it with a broad mahogany-colored match . He leaned back in his chair with the smile of a bored aristocrat . All set ? " I enquired . " Pulse and respiration normal ? You would n't like a cold towel on your head or anything ? " He did n't curl his lip because it had been curled when he came in . " A private detective , " he said . " I never met one . A shifty business , one gathers . Keyhole peeping , raking up scandal , that sort of thing . " " You here on business , " I asked him , " or just slumming ? " His smile was as faint as a fat lady at a fireman 's ball . " The name is Murdock . That probably means a little something to you . " " You certainly made nice time over here , " I said , and started to fill a pipe . He watched me fill the pipe . He said slowly : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sort . She has given you a check . " I finished filling the pipe , put a match to it , got it drawing and leaned back to blow smoke over my right shoulder towards the open window . I did n't say anything . He leaned forward a little more and said earnestly : " I know being cagey is all part of your trade , but I am not guessing . A little worm told me , a simple garden worm , often trodden on , but still somehow surviving  --  like myself . I happened to be not far behind you . Does that help to clear things up ? " 261 the high window " Yeah , " I said . " Supposing it made any difference to me . " " You are hired to find my wife , I gather . " I made a snorting sound and grinned at him over the pipe bowl . " Marlowe , " he said , even more earnestly , " I 'll try hard , but I do n't think I am going to like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " With rage and pain . " " And if you will pardon a homely phrase , your tough guy act stinks . " " Coming from you , that 's bitter . " He leaned back again and brooded at me with pale eyes . He fussed around in the chair , trying to get comfortable . A lot of people had tried to get comfortable in that chair . I ought to try it myself sometime . Maybe it was losing business for me . " Why should my mother want Linda found ? " he asked slowly . " She hated her guts . I mean my mother hated Linda 's guts . Linda was quite decent to my mother . What do you think of her ? " " Your mother ? " " Of course . You have n't met Linda , have you ? " " That secretary of your mother 's has her job hanging by a frayed thread . She talks out of turn . " He shook his head sharply . " Mother wo n't know . Anyhow , Mother could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bully . She might yell at her or even slap her face , but she could n't do without her . What did you think of her ? " " Kind of cute  --  in an old world sort of way . " He frowned . " I mean Mother . Merle 's just a simple little girl , I know . " " Your powers of observation startle me , " I said . Ile looked surprised . He almost forgot to fingernail thethe high window 27ash of his cigarette . But not quite . He was careful not to get any of it in the ashtray , however . " About my mother , " he said patiently . " A grand old warhorse , " I said . " A heart of gold , and the gold buried good and deep . " " But why does she want Linda found ? I ca n't understand it . Spending money on it too . My mother hates to spend money . She thinks money is part of her skin . Why does she want Linda found ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she did ? " " Why , you implied so . And Merle  --  " " Merle 's just romantic . She made it up . Hell , she blows her nose in a man 's handkerchief . Probably one of yours . " He blushed . " That 's silly . Look , Marlowe . Please , be reasonable and give me an idea what it 's all about . I have n't much money , I 'm afraid , but would a couple of hundred  --  " " I ought to bop you , " I said . " Besides I 'm not supposed to talk to you . Orders . " " Why , for heaven 's sake ? " " Do n't ask me things I do n't know . I ca n't tell you the answers . And do n't ask me things I do know , because I wo n't tell you the answers . Where have you been all your life ? If a man in my line of work is handed a job , does he go around answering questions about it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of electricity in the air , " he said nastily , " for a man in your line of work to turn down two hundreddollars . " There was nothing in that for me either . I picked his broad mahogany match out of the tray and looked at it . It had thin yellow edges and there was white printing on it . RosFmoNT . H. RICHARDS ' 3  --  the rest was burnt off . I doubled the match28 the high window and squeezed the halves together and tossed it in the waste basket . " I love my wife , " he said suddenly and showed me the hard white edges of his teeth . " A corny touch , but it 's true . " " The Lombardos are still doing all right . " He kept his lips pulled back from his teeth and talked through them at me . " She does n't love me . I know of no particular reason why she should . Things have been strained between us . She was used to a fast moving sort of life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have n't quarreled . Linda 's the cool type . But she has n't really had a lot of fun being married to me . " " You 're just too modest , " I said . His eyes glinted , but lie kept his smooth manner pretty well in place . " Not good , Marlowe . Not even fresh . Look , you have the air of a decant sort of guy . I know my mother is not putting out two hundred and fifty bucks just to be breezy . Maybe it 's not Linda . Maybe it 's something else . Maybe  --  " he stopped and then said this very slowly , watching my eyes , " maybe it 's Morny . " " Maybe it is , " I said cheerfully . He picked his gloves up and slapped the desk with them and put them down again . " I 'm in a spot there all right , " he said . " But I did n't think she knew about it . Morny must have called her up . He promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " How much are you into him for ? " It was n't so easy . He got suspicious again . " If he called her tip , lie would have told her . And she would have told you , " he said thinly . " Maybe it is n't Morny , " I said , beginning to want a drink very badly . " Maybe the cook is with child by the iceman. the high window 29But if it was Morny , how much ? " " Twelve thousand , " he said , looking down and flushing . " Threats ? " He nodded . " Tell him to go fly a kite , " I said . " What kind of lad is he ? Tough ? " He looked up again , his face being brave . " I suppose he is . I suppose they all are . He used to be a screen heavy . Good looking in a flashy way , a chaser . But do n't get any ideas . Linda just worked there , like the waiters and the band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have a hard time finding her . " I sneered at him politely . " Why would I have a hard time finding her ? She 's not buried in the back yard , I hope . " He stood up with a flash of anger in his pale eyes . Standingthere leaning over the desk a little he whipped his right hand up in a neat enough gesture and brought out a small automatic , about .25 caliber with a walnut grip . It looked like the brother of the one I had seen in the drawer of Merle 's desk . The muzzle looked vicious enough pointing at me . I did n't move . " If anybody tries to push Linda around , he 'll have to push me around first , " he said tightly . " That ought n't to be too hard . Better get more gun  --  unless you 're just thinking of bees . " He put the little gun back in his inside pocket . He gave me a straight hard look and picked his gloves up and started for the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " he said . " All you do is crack wise . " I said : " Wait a minute , " and got up and went around the30 the high windowdesk . " It might be a good idea for you not to mention this interview to your mother , if only for the little girl 's sake . " He nodded . " For the amount of information I got , it does n't seem worth mentioning . " " That straight goods about your owing Morny twelve grand ? " He looked down , then up , then down again . He said : " Anybodywho could get into Alex Morny for twelve grand would have to be a lot smarter than I am . " I was quite close to him . I said : " As a matter of fact I do n't even think you are worried about your wife . I think you know where she is . She did n't run away from you at all . She just ran away from your mother . " He lifted his eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Perhaps she 'll get a job , " I said . " And make enough money to support you . " He looked down at the floor again , turned his body to the right a little and the gloved fist made a tight unrelaxed arc through the air upwards . I moved my jaw out of the way and caught his wrist and pushed it slowly back against his chest , leaning on it . He slid a foot back on the floor and began to breathe hard . It was a slender wrist . My fingers went around it and met . We stood there looking into each other 's eyes . He was breathing like a drunk , his mouth open and his lips pulled back . Small round spots of bright red flamed on his cheeks . He tried to jerk his wrist away , but I put so much weight on him that he had to take another short step back to brace himself . Our faces were now only inches apart . " How come your old man did n't leave you some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow it all ? " the high window 31He spoke between his teeth , still trying to jerk loose . " If it 's any of your rotten business and you mean jasper Murdock , he was n't my father . He did n't like me and he did n't leave me a cent . My father was a man named Horace Bright who lost his money in the crash and jumped out of his office window . " " You milk easy , " I said , " but you give pretty thin milk . I 'm sorry for what I said about your wife supporting you . I just wanted to get your goat . " I dropped his wrist and stepped back . He still breathed hard and heavily . His eyes on mine were very angry , but he kept his voice down . " Well , you got it . If you 're satisfied , I 'll be on my way . " " I was doing you a favor , " I said . " A gun toter ought n't to insult so easily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " I 'm sorry I took a swing at you . It probably would n't have hurt much , if it had con-nected . " " That 's all right . " He opened the door and went on out . His steps died along the corridor . Another screwball . I tapped my teeth with a knuckle in time to the sound of his steps as long as I could hear them . Then I went back to the desk , looked at my pad , and lifted the phone , 4After the bell had rung three times at the other end of the line a light childish sort of girl 's voice filtered itself through a hank of gum and said : " Good morning . Mr. Morningstar 's office . " " Is the old gentleman in ? " 32 the high window " Who is calling , please ? " " Marlowe . " " Does he know you , Mr. Marlowe ? " " Ask him if he wants to buy any early American gold coins . " " Just a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elderly party in an inner office having his attention called to the fact that somebody on the telephone wanted to talk to him . Then the phone clicked and a man spoke . He had a dry voice . You might even call it parched . " This is Mr. Morningstar . " " I 'm told you called Mrs. Murdock in Pasadena , Mr. Morningstar . About a certain coin . " " About a certain coin , " he repeated . " Indeed . Well ? " " My understanding is that you wished to buy the coin in question from the Murdock collection . " " Indeed ? And who are you , sir ? " " Philip Marlowe . A private detective . I 'm working for Mrs. Murdock . " " Indeed , " he said for the third time . He cleared his throat carefully . " And what did you wish to talk to me about , Mr. Marlowe ? " " About this coma " " But I was informed it was not for sale . " " I still want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you mean she has changed her mind about selling ? " " No . " " Then I 'm afraid I do n't understand what you want , Mr.Marlowe . What have we to talk about ? " He sounded sly now . I took the ace out of my sleeve and played it with a languidgrace . " The point is , Mr. Morningstar , that at the timethe high window 33you called up you already knew the coin was n't for sale . " " Interesting , " he said slowly . " How ? " " You 're in the business , you could n't help knowing . It 's a matter of public record that the Murdock collection can not be sold during Mrs. Murdock 's lifetime . " " Ali , " he said . " Ali . " There was a silence . Then , " At three o'clock , " he said , not sharp , but quick . " I shall be glad to see you here in my office . You probably know where it is . Will that suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . I hung up and lit my pipe again and sat there looking at the wall . My face was stiff with thought , or with something that made my face stiff . I took Linda Murdock 's photo out of my pocket , stared at it for a while , decided that the face was pretty commonplace after all , locked the photo away in my desk . I picked Murdock 's second match out of my ashtray and looked it over . The lettering on this one read : TopROW W. A wffiGHT " .36 . I dropped it back in the tray , wondering what made this important . Maybe it was a clue . I got Mrs. Murdock 's check out of my wallet , endorsed it , made out a deposit slip and a check for cash , got my bank book out of the desk , and folded the lot under a rubber band and put them in my pocket . Lois Magic was not listed in the phone book . I got the classified section up on the desk and made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest type and called them . They all had bright cheerful voices and wanted to ask a lot of questions , but they either did n't know or did n't care to tell me anything about a Miss Lois Magic , said to be an entertainer . I threw the list in the waste basket and called Kenny Haste , 34 the high windowa crime reporter on the Chronicle . " What do you know about Alex Morny ? " I asked him when we were through cracking wise at each other . " Runs a plushy night chub and gambling joint in Idle Valley , about two miles off the highway back towards the hills . Used to be in pictures . Lousy actor . Seems to have plenty of protection . I never heard of him shooting anybody on the public square at high noon . Or at any other time for that matter . But I would n't like to bet on it . " " Dangerous ? " " I 'd say he might be , if necessary . All those boys have been to picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has a bodyguard who is quite a character . His name 's Eddie Prue , he 's about six feet five inches tall and thin as an honest alibi . Ile has a frozen eye , the result of a war wound . " " Is Morny dangerous to women ? " " Do n't be Victorian , old top . Women do n't call it danger . " " Do you know a girl named Lois Magic , said to be an entertainer . A tall gaudy blond , I hear . " " No . Sounds as though I might like to . " " Do n't be cute . Do you know anybody named Vannier ? None of these people are in the phone book . " " Nope . But I could ask Gertie Arbogast , if you want to call back . He knows all the night club aristocrats . And heels . " " Thanks , Kenny . I 'll do that . Half an hour ? " IIe said that would be fine , and we hung up . I locked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the angle of the wall , a youngishblond man in a brown suit and a cocoa-colored straw hat with a brown and yellow tropical print band was reading the evening paper with his back to the wall . As I passed him hethe high window 35yawned and tucked the paper under his arm and straight- ened up . He got into the elevator with me . He could hardly keep his eyes open he was so tired . I went out on the street and walked a block to the bank to deposit my check and draw out a little folding money for expenses . From there I went to the Tigertail Lounge and sat in a shallow booth and drank a martini and ate a sandwich . The man in the brown suit posted himself at the end of the bar and drank coca colas and looked bored and piled pennies in front of him , carefully smoothing the edges . He had his dark glasses on again . That made him invisible . I dragged my sandwich out as long as I could and then strolled back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar . The man in the brown suit turned his head quickly and then covered the motion by lifting his glass . I dialed the Chronicle office again . " Okay , " Kenny Haste said . " Gertie Arbogast says Morny married your gaudy blond not very long ago . Lois Magic . He does n't know Vanier . He says'Morny bought a place out be- yond Bel-Air , a white house on Stillwood Crescent Drive , about five blocks north of Sunset . Gertie says Morny took it over from a busted flush named Arthur Blake Popham who got caught in a mail fraud rap . Popham 's initials are still on the gates . And probably on the toilet paper , Gertie says . He was that kind of a guy . That 's all we seem to know . " " Nobody could ask more . Many thanks , Kenny . " I hung up , stepped out of the booth , met the dark glasses above the brown suit under the cocoa straw hat and watched them turn quickly away . I spun around and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to the alley and along the alley36 the high window a quarter block to the back of the parking lot where I hadput my car . No sand-colored coupe succeeded in getting behind me as I drove off , in the general direction of Bel-Air. 5Stillwood Crescent Drive curved leisurely north from Sunset Boulevard , well beyond the Bel-Air Country Club golf course . The road was lined with walled and fenced estates . Some had high walls , some had low walls , some had ornamental iron fences , some were a bit oldfashioned and got along with tall hedges . The street bad no sidewalk . Nobody walked in that neighborhood , not even the mailman . The afternoon was hot , but not hot like Pasadena . There was a drowsy smell of flowers and sun , a swishing of lawn sprinklers gentle behind hedges and walls , the clear ratchety sound of lawn mowers moving delicately over serene and confident lawns . I drove up the hill slowly , looking for monograms on gates . Arthur Blake Popham was the name . ABP would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gilt on a black shield , the gates folded back on a black composition driveway . It was a glaring white house that had the air of being brand new , but the landscaping was well advanced . It was modest enough for the neighborhood , not more than fourteen rooms and probably only one swimming pool . Its wall was low , made of brick with the concrete all oozed out between and set that way and painted over white . On top of the wall a low iron railing painted black . The name A. P. Morny was stencilled on the large silver-colored mailbox at the service entrance. the high window X37I parked my crate on the street and walked up the black driveway to a side door of glittering white paint shot with patches of color from the stained glass canopy over it . I hammeredon a large brass knocker . Back along the side of the house a chauffeur was washing off a Cadillac . The door opened and a hard-eyed Filipino in a white coat curled his lip at me . I gave him a card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut the door . Time passed , as it always does when I go calling . The swish of water on the Cadillac had a cool sound . The chauffeur was a little runt in breeches and leggingsand a sweat-stained shirt . He looked like an overgrown jockey and he made the same kind of hissing noise as he worked on the car that a groom makes rubbing down a horse . A red-throated hummingbird went into a scarlet bush beside the door , shook the long tubular blooms around a little , and zoomed off so fast he simply disappeared in the air . The door opened , the Filipino poked my card at me . I did n't take it . " What you want ? " It was a tight crackling voice , like someone tiptoeing across a lot of eggshells . " Want to see Mrs. Morny . " " She not at home . " " Did n't you know that when I gave you the card ? " He opened his fingers and let the card flutter to the ground . He grinned , showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know when she tell me . " He shut the door in my face , not gently . I picked the card up and walked along the side of the house to where the chauffeur was squirting water on the Cadillac sedan and rubbing the dirt off with a big sponge. 38 the high window He had red rimmed eyes and a bang of corn-colored hair . A cigarette hung exhausted at the corner of his lower lip . He gave me the quick side glance of a man who is minding his own business with difficulty . I said : " Where 's the boss ? " The cigarette jiggled in his mouth . The water went on swishing gently on the paint . " Ask at the house , Jack . " " I done asked . They done shut the door in mah face . " " You 're breaking my heart , Jack . " " How about Mrs. Morny ? " " Same answer , Jack . I just work here . Selling something ?

Ile stepped around the water to wipe his hands on a towel that hung at the side of the garage doors . He fished a match out of his pants , struck it and tilted his head back to light the dead butt that was stuck in his face . His foxy little eyes flicked around this way and that and he moved behind the car , with a jerk of the head . I went over near him . " How 's the little old expense account ? " he asked in a small careful voice . " Fat with inactivity . " " For five I could start thinking . " " I would n't want to make it that tough for you . " " For ten I could sing like four canaries and a steel guitar . " " I do n't like these plushy orchestrations , " I said . He cocked his head sideways . " Talk English , Jack .

" Gim me the two bucks , " he snapped . I gave him two dollars . " She 's in the backyard with a friend , " he said . " A nice friend . You got a friend that do n't work and a husband that works , you 're all set , see ? " He leered .. " You 'll be all set in an irrigation ditch one of these days . " " Not me , Jack . I 'm wise .

I mon- keyed around these kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar bills between his palms , blew on them , folded them longways and wideways and tucked them in the watch pocket of his breeches . " That was just the soup , " he said . " Now for five more  --  " A rather large blond cocker spaniel tore around the Cadil- lac , skidded a little on the wet concrete , took off neatly , hit me in the stomach and thighs with all four paws , licked myface , dropped to the ground , ran around my legs , sat down between them , let his tongue out all the way and started to pant . I stepped over him and braced myself against the side of the car and got my handkerchief out . A male voice called : " Here , Heathcliff . Here , Heathcliff . " Steps sounded on a hard walk . " That 's Heathcliff , " the chauffeur said sourly . " Heathcliff ? " 40 the high window " Cripes , that 's what they call the dog , Jack . " " Wuthering Heights ? " I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneered . " Look out  --  company . " He picked up the sponge and the hose and went back to washing the car . I moved away from him . The cocker spaniel immediately moved between my legs again , almost tripping me . " Here , Heathcliff , " the male voice called out louder , and a man came into view through the opening of a latticed tunnelcovered with climbing roses . Tall , dark , with a clear olive skin , brilliant black eyes , gleaming white teeth . Sideburns . A narrow black mustache . Sideburns too long , much too long . White shirt with embroideredinitials on the pocket , white slacks , white shoes . A wrist watch that curved halfway around a lean dark wrist , held on by a gold chain . A yellow scarf around a bronzed slender neck . He saw the dog squatted between my legs and did n't like it . He snapped long fingers and snapped a clear hard voice : " Here , Heathcliff . Come here at once ! " The dog breathed hard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my right leg . " Who are you ? " the man asked , staring me down . I held out my card . Olive fingers took the card . The dog quietly backed out from between my legs , edged around the front end of the car , and faded silently into the distance . " Marlowe , " the man said . " Marlowe , eh ? What 's this ? A detective ? What do you want ? " " Want to see Mrs. Morny . " He looked me up and down , brilliant black eyes sweeping slowly and the silky fringes of long eyelashes following them. the high window 41 . " Were n't you told she was not in ? " " Yeah , but I did n't believe it . Are you Mr. Moray ? " " No . " " That 's Mr. Vannier , " the chauffeur said behind my back , in the drawled , over-polite voice of deliberate insolence . " Mr. Vannier 's a friend of the family . He comes here quite a lot . " Vannier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chauffeur came around the car and spit the cigarette stub out of his mouth with casual contempt . " I told the shamus the boss was n't here , Mr. Vannier . " " I see . " " I told him Mrs. Morny and you was here . Did I do wrong ? " Vannier said : " You could have minded your own business . " The chauffeur said : " I wonder why the hell I did n't thinkof that . " Vannier said : " Get out before I break your dirty little neck for you . " The chauffeur eyed him quietly and then went back into the gloom of the garage and started to whistle . Vannier moved his hot angry eyes over to me and snapped : " You were told Mrs. Morny was not in , but it did n't take . Is that it ? In other words the information failed to satisfy you . " If we have to have other words , " I said , " those might do . " " I see . Could you bring yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morny ? " " I 'd prefer to explain that to Mrs. Morny herself . " " The implication is that she does n't care to see you . " Behind the car the chauffeur said : " Watch his right , Jack . It might have a knife in it . " Vannier 's olive skin turned the color of dried seaweed. 421 the high window He turned on his heel and rapped at me in a stifled voice : " Follow me . " He went along the brick path under the tunnel of roses and through a white gate at the end . Beyond was a walled-in garden containing flowerbeds crammed with showy annuals , a badminton court , a nice stretch of greensward , and a small tiled pool glittering angrily in the sun . Beside the pool there was a flagged space set with blue and white garden furniture , low tables with composition tops , reclining chairs with footrestsand enormous cushions , and over all a blue and white umbrella as big as a small tent . A long-limbed languorous type of showgirl blond lay at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet raised on a padded rest and a tall misted glass at her elbow , near a silver ice bucket and a Scotch bottle . She looked at us lazily as we came over the grass . From thirty feet away she looked like a lot of class . From ten feet away she looked like something made up to be seen from thirty feet away . Her mouth was too wide , her eyes were too blue , her makeup was too vivid , the thin arch of her eyebrows was almost fantastic in its curve and spread , and the mascara was so thick on her eyelashes that they looked like miniature iron railings . She wore white duck slacks , blue and white open-toed sandals over bare feet and crimson lake toenails , a white silk blouse and a necklace of green stones that were not square cut emeralds . Her hair was as artificial as a night club lobby . On the chair beside her there was a white straw garden hat with a brim the size of a spare tire and a white satin chin strap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of green sun glasses with lenses the size of doughnuts . Vannier marched over to her and snapped out : " You 've got to can that nasty little red-eyed driver of yours , but quick. the high window 43Otherwise I 'm liable to break his neck any minute . I ca n't go near him without getting insulted . " The blond coughed lightly , flicked a handkerchief around without doing anything with it , and said : " Sit down and rest your sex appeal . Who 's your friend ? " Vannier looked for my card , found he was holding it in his hand and threw it on her lap . She picked it up languidly , ran her eyes over it , ran them over me , sighed and tapped her teeth with her fingernails . " Big , is n't he ? Too much for you to handle , I guess . " Vannier looked at me nastily . " All right , get it over with , *whatever it is . " " Do I talk to her ? " I asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in English ? " The blond laughed . A silvery ripple of laughter that held the unspoiled naturalness of a bubble dance . A small tongue played roguishly along her lips . Vannier sat down and lit a gold-tipped cigarette and I stood there looking at them . I said : " I 'm looking for a friend of yours , Mrs. Morny . I understand that she shared an apartment with you about a year ago . Her name is Linda Conquest . " Vannier flicked his eyes up , down , up , down . He turned his head and looked across the pool . The cocker spaniel named Heathcliff sat over there looking at us with the white of one eye . Vannier snapped his fingers . " Here , Heathcliff ! Here , Heathcliff ! Come here , sir ! " The blond said : " Shut up . The dog hates your guts . Give your vanity a rest , for heaven 's sake . " Vannier snapped : " Do n't talk like that to me . " The blond giggled and petted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm looking for a girl named Linda Conquest , Mrs. Morny . " The blond looked at me and said : " So you said . I was just thinking . I do n't think I 've seen her in six months . She got married . " " You have n't seen her in six months ? " " That 's what I said , big boy . What do you want to know for ? " " Just a private enquiry I 'm making . " " About what ? " " About a confidential matter , " I said . " Just think , " the blond said brightly . " He 's making a privateenquiry about a confidential matter . You hear that , Lou ? Busting in on total strangers that do n't want to see him is quite all right , though , is n't it , Lou ? On account of he 's making a private enquiry about a confidential matter . " " Then you do n't know where she is , Mrs. Morny ? " " Did n't I say so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . You said you did n't think you had seen her in sixmonths . Not quite the same thing . " " Who told you I shared an apartment with her ? " the blond snapped . " I never reveal a source of information , Mrs. Morny . " " Sweetheart , you 're fussy enough to be a dance director . I should tell you everything , you should tell me nothing . " " The position is quite different , " I said . " I 'm a hired hand obeying instructions . The lady has no reason to hide out , has she ? " " Who 's looking for her ? " " Her folks . " " Guess again . She does n't have any folks . " " You must know her pretty well , if you know that , " I said. the high window 45 " Maybe I did once . That do n't prove I do now . " " Okay , " I said . " The answer is you know , but you wo n't tell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is that you 're not wanted here and the sooner you get out , the better we like it . " I kept on looking at Mrs. Morny . She winked at me and said to Vannier : " Do n't get so hostile , darling . You have a lot of charm , but you have small bones . You 're not built for the rough work . That right , big boy ? " I said : " I had n't thought about it , Mrs. Morny . Do you think Mr. Morny could help me  --  or would ? " She shook her head . " How would I know ? You could try . If he do n't like you , he has guys around that can bounce you . " I think you could tell me yourself , if you wanted to . " " How are you going to make me want to ? " Her eyes were inviting . " With all these people around , " I said , " how can I ? " " That 's a thought , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me over it . Vannier stood up very slowly . His face was white . He put his hand inside his shirt and said slowly , between his teeth : " Get out , mugg . While you can still walk . " I looked at him in surprise . " Where 's your refinement ? " I asked him . " And do n't tell me you wear a gun with your garden clothes . " The blond laughed , showing a fine strong set of teeth . Vannier thrust his hand under his left arm inside the shirt and set his lips . His black eyes were sharp and blank at the same time , like a snake 's eyes . " You heard me , " he said , almost softly . " And do n't write me off too quick . I 'd plug you as soon as I 'd strike a match . And fix it afterwards . " 46 the high window I looked at the blond . Her eyes were bright and her mouth looked sensual and eager , watching us . I turned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked back at them . Vannier stood in exactly the same position , his hand inside his shirt . The blond 's eyes were still wide and her lips parted , but the shadow of the umbrella had dimmed her expression and at that distance it might have been either fear or pleased anticipation . I went on over the grass , through the white gate and along the brick path under the rose arbor . I reached the end of it , turned , walked quietly back to the gate and took another look at them . I did n't know what there would be to see or what I cared about it when I : saw it . What I saw was Vannier practically sprawled on top of the blond , kissing her . I shook my head and went back along the walk . The red-eyed chauffeur was still at work on the Cadillac . He had finished the wash job and was wiping off the glass and nickel with a large chamois . I went around and stood beside him . " How you come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth . " Badly . They tramped all over me , " I said . He nodded and went on making the hissing noise of a groom rubbing down a horse . " You better watch your step . The guy 's heeled , " I said . " Or pretends to be . " The chauffeur laughed shortly . " Under that suit ? Nix . " " Who is this guy Vannier ? What does he do ? " The chauffeur straightened up , put the chamois over the sill of a window and wiped his hands on the towel that was now stuck in his waistband. the high window 47 " Women , my guess would be , " he said . " Is n't it a bit dangerous  --  playing with this particular woman ? " " I 'd say it was , " he agreed . " Different guys got different ideas of danger . It would scare me . " " Where does he live ? " " Sherman Oaks . She goes over there . She 'll go once too often . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tall , dark , handsome , used to be a singer with a band ? " " For two bucks , Jack , you expect a lot of service . " " I could build it up to five . " He shook his head . " I do n't know the party . Not by that name . All kinds of dames come here , mostly pretty flashy . I do n't get introduced . " He grinned . I got my wallet out and put three ones in his little damp paw . I added a business card . " I like small close-built men , " I said . " They never seem to be afraid of anything . Come and see me some time . " " I might at that , Jack . Thanks . Linda Conquest , huh ? I 'll keep my ear flaps off . " " So long , " I said . " The name ? " " They call me Shifty . I never knew why . " " So long , Shifty . " " So long . Gat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance . " " I do n't know , " I said . " He made the motion . I 'm not hired to gunfight with strangers . " " Hell , that shirt he 's wearing only got two buttons at the top . I noticed . Take him a week to pull a rod from under that . " But he sounded faintly worried . " I guess he was just bluffing , " I agreed . " If you hear men-4$1 the high windowtion of Linda Conquest , I 'll be glad to talk business with you . " Okay , Jack . " I went back along the black driveway . He stood there scratching his chin . QI drove along the block looking for a place to park so that I could run up to the office for a moment before going on downtown . A chauffeur-driven Packard edged out from the curb in front of a cigar store about thirty feet from the entrance to my building . I slid into the space , locked the car and stepped out . It was only then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had parked was a familiar-looking sand-colored coupe . It did n't have to be the same one . There were thousands of them . Nobody was in it . Nobody was near it that wore a cocoa straw hat with a brown and yellow band . I went around to the street side and looked at the steering post . No license holder . I wrote the license plate number down on the back of an envelope , just in case , and went on into my building . He was n't in the lobby , or in the corridor upstairs . I went into the office , looked on the floor for mail , did n't find any , bought myself a short drink out of the office bottle and left . I did n't have any time to spare to get downtown before three o'clock . The sand-colored coupe was still parked , still empty . I got into mine and started up and moved out into the traffic stream . I was below Sunset on Vine before he picked me up . I keptthe high window 49on going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhapsin the car parked behind his own . I had n't thought of that . I drove south to Third and all the way downtown on Third . The sand-colored coupe kept half a block behind me all the way . I moved over to Seventh and Grand , parked near Seventhand Olive , stopped to buy cigarettes I did n't need , and then walked east along Seventh without looking behind me . At Spring I went into the Hotel Metropole , strolled over to the big horseshoe cigar counter to light one of my cigarettes and then sat down in one of the old brown leather chairs in the lobby . A blond man in a brown suit , dark glasses and the now familiar hat came into the lobby and moved unobtrusively among the potted palms and the stucco arches to the cigar counter . He bought a package of cigarettes and broke it open standing there , using the time to lean his back against the counter and give the lobby the benefit of his eagle eye . He picked up his change and went over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tipped his hat down over his dark glasses and seemed to go to sleep with an unlighted cigarette between his lips . I got up and wandered over and dropped into the chair beside him . I looked at him sideways . He did n't move . Seen at close quarters his face seemed young and pink and plump and the blond beard on his chin was very carelessly shaved . Behind the dark glasses his eyelashes flicked up and down rapidly . A hand on his knee tightened and pulled the cloth into wrinkles . There was a wart on his cheek just below the right eyelid . I struck a match and held the flame to his cigarette . " Light ? " 50 the high window " Oh  --  thanks , " he said , very surprised . He drew breath in until the cigarette tip glowed . I shook the match out , tossed it into the sand jar at my elbow and waited . He looked at me sideways several times before he spoke . " Have n't I seen you somewhere before ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I could see his cheeks get pinker than they had been . He sighed . " I must be lousy , " be said . " Boy , you stink , " I agreed . " Maybe it 's the hat , " he said . " The hat helps , " I said . " Rut you do n't really need it . " " It 's a pretty tough dollar in this town , " he said sadly . " You ca n't do it on foot , you ruin yourself with taxi fares if you use taxis , and if you use your own car , it 's always where you ca n't get to it fast enough . You have to stay too close . " " But you do n't have to climb in a guy 's pocket , " I said . " Did you want something with me or are you just practising ? " " I figured I 'd find out if you were smart enough to be worthtalking to . " " I 'm very smart , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " He looked carefully around back of his chair and on both sides of where we were sitting and then drew a small , pigskin wallet out . He handed me a nice fresh card from it . It read : George Anson Phillips . Confidential Investigations . 212 SengerBuilding , 1924 North Wilcox Avenue , Hollywood . A Glenviewtelephone number . In the upper left hand corner there was an open eye with an eyebrow arched in surprise and very long eyelashes . " You ca n't do that , " I said , pointing to the eye . " That 's the Pinkerton 's . You 'll be stealing their business . " . the high window 51 " Oh hell , " he said , " what little I get would n't bother them . " I snapped the card on my fingernail and bit down hard on my teeth and slipped the card into my pocket . " You want one of mine  --  or have you completed your file on me ? " " Oh , I know all about you , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time you were working on the Gregson case . " Gregson was a con man from Oklahoma City who was followedall over the United States for two years by one of his victims until he got so jittery that he shot up a service station attendant who mistook him for an acquaintance . It seemed a long time ago to me . I said : " Go on from there . " " I remembered your name when I saw it on your registrationthis a.m . So when I lost you on the way into town I just looked you up . I was going to come in and talk , but it would have been a violation of confidence . This way I kind of ca n't help myself . " Another screwball . That made three in one day , not countingMrs . Murdock , who might turn out to be a screwball too . I waited while he took his dark glasses off and polished them and put them on again and gave the neighborhood the once over again . Then he said : " I figured we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they say . I saw the guy go into your office , so I figured he had hired you . " " You knew who he was ? " " I 'm working on him , " he said , and his voice sounded flat and discouraged . " And where I am getting is no place at all . " " What did he do to you ? " " Well , I 'm working for his wife . " " Divorce ? " 52 the high window He looked all around him carefully and said in a small voice : " So she says . But I wonder . " " They both want one , " I said . " Each trying to get something on the other . Comical , is n't it ? " " My end I do n't like so well . A guy is tailing me around some of the time . A very tall guy with a funny eye . I shake him but after a while I see him again . A very tall guy . Like a lamppost . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtfully . " Anything to do with you ? " the blond man asked me a little anxiously . I shook my head and threw my cigarette into the sand jar . " Never saw him that I know of . " I looked at my strap watch . " We better get together and talk this thing over properly , but I ca n't do it now . I have an appointment . " " I 'd like to , " he said . " Very much . " " Let 's then . My office , my apartment , or your office , or where ? " He scratched his badly shaved chin with a well-chewed thumbnail . " My apartment , " he said at last . " It 's not in the phone book . Give me that card a minute . " He turned it over on his palm when I gave it to him and wrote slowly with a small metal pencil , moving his tongue along his lips . He was getting younger every minute . He did n't seem much more than twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gregson case had been six years back . He put his pencil away and handed me back the card . The address he had written on it was 204 Florence Apartments , 128 Court Street . I looked at him curiously . " Court Street on Bunker Hill ? " He nodded , flushing all over his blond skin . " Not too good , " the high window 153he said quickly . " I have n't been in the chips lately . Do you mind ? " " No , why would I ? " I stood up and held a hand out . He shook it and dropped it and I pushed it down into my hip pocket and rubbed the palm against the handkerchief I had there . Looking at his face more closely I saw that there was a line of moisture across his upper lip and more of it along the side of his nose . It was not as hot as all that . I started to move off and then I turned back to lean down close to his face and say : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure , she 's a tall blond with careless eyes , huh ? " " I would n't call them careless , " he said . I held my face together while I said : " And just between the two of us this divorce stuff is a lot of hooey . It 's something else entirely , is n't it ? " " Yes , " he said softly , " and something I do n't like more every minute I think about it . Here . " He pulled something out of his pocket and dropped it into my hand . It was a flat key . " No need for you to wait around in the hall , if I happen to be out . I have two of them . What time would you think you would come ? " " About four-thirty , the way it looks now . You sure you want to give me this key ? " " Why , we 're in the same racket , " he said , looking up at me innocently , or as innocently as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the lobby I looked back . He sat there peacefully , with the half-smoked cigarette dead between his lips and the gaudy brown and yellow band on his hat looking as54 the high windowquiet as a cigarette ad on the back page of the Saturday Evening Post . We were in the same racket . So I would n't chisel him . just like that . I could have the key to his apartment and go in and make myself at home . I could wear his slippers and drink his liquor and lift tip his carpet and count the thousanddollar bills under it . We were in the same racket . The Belfont Building was eight stories of nothing in particularthat had got itself pinched off between a large green and chromium cut rate suit emporium and a three-story and basement garage that made a noise like lion cages at feeding time . The small dark narrow lobby was as dirty as a chicken yard . The building directory had a Iot of vacant space on it . Only one of the names meant anything to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large sign tilted against the fake marble wall said : Space for Renting Suitable for Cigar Stand . Apply Room 316 . There were two open-grill elevators but only one seemed to be running and that not busy . An old man sat inside it slack-jawed and watery-eyed on a piece of folded burlap on top of a wooden stool . He looked as if he had been sitting there since the Civil War and had come out of that badly . I got in with him and said eight , and he wrestled the doors shut and cranked his buggy and we dragged upwards lurching . The old man breathed hard , as if he was carrying the elevator on his back . I got out at my floor and started along the hallway and behind me the old man leaned out of the car and blew histhe high window 55nose with his fingers into a carton full of floor sweepings . Elisha Morningstar 's office was at the back , opposite the firedoor . Two rooms , both lettered in flaked black paint on pebbled glass . Elisha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Entrance . I turned the knob and went into a small narrow room with two windows , a shabby little typewriter desk , closed , a numberof wall cases of tarnished coins in tilted slots with yellowedtypewritten labels under them , two brown filing cases at the back against the wall , no curtains at the windows , and a dust gray floor carpet so threadbare that you would n't notice the rips in it unless you tripped over one . An inner wooden door was open at the back across from the filing cases , behind the little typewriter desk . Through the door came the small sounds a man makes when he is n't doing anything at all . Then the dry voice of Elisha Morningstarcalled out : " Come in , please . Come in . " I went along and in . The inner office was just as small but had a lot more stuff in it . A green safe almost blocked off the front half . Beyond this a heavy old mahogany table against the entrance door held some dark books , some flabby old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back wall a window was open a few inches , without effect on the musty smell . There was a hatrack with a greasy black felt hat on it . There were three long-legged tables with glass tops and more coins under the glass tops . There was a heavy dark leather-topped desk midway of the room . It had the usual desk stuff on it , and in addition a pair of jeweller 's scales under a glass dome and two large nickel-framed magnifying glasses and a jeweller 's eyepiece lying on a buff scratch pad , beside a cracked yellow silk handkerchief spotted with ink. 1 56 the high window IIn the swivel chair at the desk sat an elderly party in a dark gray suit with high lapels and too many buttons down the front . He had some stringy white hair that grew long enough to tickle his ears . A pale gray bald patch loomed high up in the middle of it , like a rock above timberline . Fuzz grew out of his ears , far enough to catch a moth . He had sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brownish purple in color and traced with a networkof wrinkles and veins . His cheeks were shiny and his short sharp nose looked as if it had hung over a lot of quick ones in its time . A Hoover collar which no decent laundry would have allowed on the premises nudged his Adam 's apple and a black string tie poked a small hard knot out at the bottom of the collar , like a mouse getting ready to come out of a mousehole . He said : " My young lady had to go to the dentist . You are Mr. Marlowe ? " I nodded . " Pray , be seated . " He waved a thin hand at the chair across the desk . I sat down . " You have some identification , I pre-sume ? " I showed it to him . While he read it I smelled him from across the desk . He had a sort of dry musty smell , like a fairly clean Chinaman . He placed my card face down on top of his desk and folded his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything in my face . " Well , Mr. Marlowe , what can I do for you ? " " Tell me about the Brasher Doubloon . " " Ali , yes , " he said . " The Brasher Doubloon . An interesting coin . " He lifted his hands off the desk and made a steeple of the fingers , like an old time family lawyer getting set for athe high window 57 little tangled grammar . " In some ways the most interesting and valuable of all early American coins . As no doubt you know . " " What I do n't know about early American coins you could almost crowd into the Rose Bowl . " " Is that so ? " he said . " Is that so ? Do you want me to tell you ? " " What I 'm here for , Mr. Morningstar . " " It is a gold coin , roughly equivalent to a twenty-dollar gold piece , and about the size of a half dollar . Almost exactly . It was made for the State of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were no mints until 1793 , when the first mint was opened in Philadelphia . The Brasher Doubloon was coined probably by the pressure molding process and its maker was a private goldsmith named Ephraim Brasher , or Brashear . Where the name survives it is usually spelled Brashear , but not on the coin . I do n't know why . " I got a cigarette into my mouth and lit it . I thought it might do something to the musty smell . " What 's the pressure moldingprocess ? " " The two halves of the mold were engraved in steel , in intaglio , of course . These halves were then mounted in lead . Gold blanks were pressed between them in a coin press . Then the edges were trimmed for weight and smoothed . The coin was not milled . There were no milling machines in 1787 . " " Kind of a slow process , " I said . He nodded his peaked white head . " Quite . And , since the surface-hardening of steel without distortion could not be accomplished at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remadefrom time to time . With consequent slight variations in design which would be visible under strong magnification . In fact it would be safe to say no two of the coins would be58 ) the high windowidentical , judged by modern methods of microscopic examination . Am I clear ? " " Yeah , " I said . " Up to a point . How many of these coins are there and what are they worth ? " He undid the steeple of fingers and put his hands back on the desk top and patted them gently up and down . " I do n't know how many there are . Nobody knows . A few hundred , a thousand , perhaps more . But of these very few indeed are uncirculated specimens in what is called mint condition . The value varies from a couple of thousand on up . I should say that at the present time , since the devaluation of the dollar , an uncirculated specimen , carefully handled by a reputable dealer , might easily bring ten thousand dollars , or even more .

IIe looked like a non-smoker . " And without a history and not so carefully handled  --  how much ? " He shrugged . " There would be the implication that the coin was illegally acquired . Stolen , or obtained by fraud . Of course it might not be so . Rare coins do turn up in odd places at odd times . In old strong boxes , in the secret drawers of desks in old New England houses . Not often , I grant you . But it happens . I know of a very valuable coin that fell out of the stuffing of a horsehair sofa which was being restored by an antique dealer . The sofa had been in the same room in the same house in Fall River , Massachusetts , for ninety years . Nobody knew how the coin got there . But generally speaking , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the country . " He looked at the corner of the ceiling with an absent stare. the high window 59I looked at him with a not so absent stare . He looked like a man who could be trusted with a secret  --  if it was his own secret . He brought his eyes down to my level slowly and said : " Five dollars , please . " I said : " Huh ? " " Five dollars , please . " " What for ? " " Do n't be absurd , Mr. Marlowe . Everything I have told you is available in the public library . In Fosdyke 's Register , in particular . You choose to come here and take up my time relating it to you . For this my charge is five dollars . " " And suppose I do n't pay it , " I said . He leaned back and closed his eyes .

I stroked the bill with my fingertips , as if it was a kitten . " Five dollars , Mr. Morningstar , " I said . He opened his eyes and looked at the bill . He smiled . " And now , " I said , " let 's talk about the Brasher Doubloon that somebody tried to sell you . " He opened his eyes a little wider . " Oh , did somebody try to sell me a Brasher Doubloon ? Now why would they do that ? " " They needed the money , " I said . " And they did n't want too many questions asked . They knew or found out that you were in the business and that the building where you had your office was a shabby dump where anything could happen . They knew your office was at the end of a corridor and that you were an elderly man who would probably not make any false moves  --  out of regard for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have known a great deal , " Elisha Morningstarsaid dryly . " They knew what they had to know in order to transact their business . Just like you and me . And none of it was hard to find out . " He stuck his little finger in his ear and worked it around and brought it out with a little dark wax on it . He wiped it off casually on his coat . " And you assume all this from the mere fact that I called up Mrs. Murdock and asked if her Brasher Doubloon was for sale ? " " Sure . She had the same idea herself . It 's reasonable . Like I said over the phone to you , you would know that coin was not for sale . If you knew anything about the business at all . And I can see that you do . " He bowed , about one inch . He did n't quite smile but he looked about as pleased as a man in a Hoover collar ever looks . " You would be offered this coin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You would want to buy it , if you could get it cheap and had the money to handle it . But you would want to know where it came from . And even if you were quite sure it was stolen , you could still buy it , if you could get it cheap enough . " " Oh , I could , could I ? " He looked amused , but not in a large way . " Sure you could  --  if you are a reputable dealer . I 'll assume you are . By buying the coin  --  cheap  --  you would be protecting the owner or his insurance carrier from complete loss . They 'd be glad to pay you back your outlay . It 's done all the time . " " Then the Murdock Brasher has been stolen , " he said abruptly the high window 61 " Do n't quote me , " I said . " It 's a secret . " He almost picked his nose this time . He just caught himself . He picked a hair out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wince . He held it up and looked at it . Looking at me past it he said : " And how much will your principal pay for the return of the coin ? " I leaned over the desk and gave him my shady leer . " One grand . What did you pay ? " " I think you are a very smart young man , " he said . Then he screwed his face up and his chin wobbled and his chest began to bounce in and out and a sound came out of him like a convalescent rooster learning to crow again after a long illness . He was laughing . It stopped after a while . His face came all smooth again and his eyes , opened , black and sharp and shrewd . " Eight hundred dollars , " he said . " Eight hundred dollars for an uncirculated specimen of the Brasher Doubloon . " He chortled . " Fine . Got it with you ? That leaves you two hundred . Fair enough . A quick turnover , a reasonable profit and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my office , " he said . " Do you take me for a fool ? " He reached an ancient silver watch out of his " vest on a black fob . He screwed up his eyes to look at it . " Let us say eleven in the morning , " he said . " Come back with your money . The coin may or may not be here , but if I am satisfied with your behavior , I will arrange matters . " " That is satisfactory , " I said , and stood up . " I have to get the money anyhow . " " Have it in used bills , " he said almost dreamily . " Used62 the high windowtwenties will do . An occasional fifty will do no harm . " I grinned and started for the door . Halfway there I turned around and went back to lean both hands on the desk and push my face over it . " What did she look like ? " He looked blank . " The girl that sold you the coin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was n't a girl . She had help . It was a man . What did the man look like ? " He pursed his lips and made another steeple with his fingers . " He was a middle-aged man , heavy set , about five feet seven inches tall and weighing around one hundred and seventy pounds . Ile said his name was Smith . He wore a blue suit , black shoes , a green tie and shirt , no hat . There was a brown bordered handkerchief in his outer pocket . His hair was dark brown sprinkled with gray . There was a bald patch about the size of a dollar on the crown of his head and a scar about two inches long running down the side of his jaw . On the left side , I think . Yes , on the left side . " " Not bad , " I said . " What about the hole in his right sock ? " " I omitted to take his shoes off . " " Darn careless of you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just stared at each other , half curious , half hostile , like new neighbors . Then suddenly he went into his laugh again . The five dollar bill I had given him was still lying on his side of the desk . I flicked a hand across and took it . " You wo n't want this now , " I said . " Since we started talking in thousands . " He stopped laughing very suddenly . Then he shrugged . " At eleven a.m. , " he said . " And no tricks , Mr. Marlowe. the high window 63Do n't think I do n't know how to protect myself . " " I hope you do , " I said , " because what you are handling is dynamite . " I left him and tramped across the empty outer office and opened the door and let it shut , staying inside . There ought to be footsteps outside in the corridor , but his transom was closed and I had n't made much noise coming on crepe rubbersoles . I hoped he would remember that . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , between the door and the little closed typewriter desk . A kid trick , but once in a while it will work , especially after a lot of smart conversation , full of worldliness and sly wit . Like a sucker play in football . And if it did n't work this time , we would just be there sneering at each other again . It worked . Nothing happened for a while except that a nose was blown . Then all by himself in there he went into his sick rooster laugh again . Then a throat was cleared . Then a swivel chair squeaked , and feet walked . A dingy white head poked into the room , about two inches past the end of the door . It hung there suspended and I went into a state of suspended animation . Then the head was drawn back and four unclean fingernails came around the edge of the door and pulled . The door closed , clicked , was shut . I started breathing again and put my ear to the wooden panel . The swivel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone being dialed . I lunged across to the instrumenton the little typewriter desk and lifted it . At the other end of the line the bell had started to ring . It rang six times . Then a man 's voice said : " Yeah ? " " The Florence Aparments ? " " Yeah . " 64 the high window " I 'd like to speak to Mr. Anson in Apartment two-o-four . " " Hold the wire . I 'll see if he 's in . " Mr. Morningstar and I held the wire . Noise came over it , the blaring sound of a loud radio broadcasting a baseball game . It was not close to the telephone , but it was noisy enough . Then I could hear the hollow sound of steps coming nearer and the harsh rattle of the telephone receiver being picked up and the voice said : " Not in . Any message ? " " I 'll call later , " Mr. Morningstar said . I hung up fast and did a rapid glide across the floor to the entrance door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let it close the same way , taking its weight at the last moment , so that the click of the catch would not have been heard three feet away . I breathed hard and tight going down the hall , listening to myself . I pushed the elevator button . Then I got out the card which Mr. George Anson Phillips had given me in the lobby of the Hotel Metropole . I did n't look at it in any real sense . I did n't have to look at it to recall that it referred to Apartment 204 , Florence Apartments , 128 Court Street . I just stood there flicking it with a fingernail while the old elevator came heaving up in the shaft , straining like a gravel truck on a hairpin turn . The time was three-fifty. 8Bunker Hill is old town , lost town , shabby town , crook town . Once , very long ago , it was the choice residential district of the city , and there are still standing a few of the jigsawthe high window 65Gothic mansions with wide porches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows with spindle turrets . They are all rooming houses now , their parquetry floors are scratched and worn through the once glossy finish and the wide sweeping staircases are dark with time and with cheap varnish laid on over generations of dirt . In the tall rooms haggard landladies bicker with shifty tenants . On the wide cool front porches , reaching their cracked shoes into the sun , and staring at nothing , sit the old men with faces like lost battles . In and around the old houses there are flyblown restaurantsand Italian fruitstands and cheap apartment houses and little candy stores where you can buy even nastier things than their candy . And there are ratty hotels where nobody except people named Smith and Jones sign the register and where the night clerk is half watchdog and half pander . Out of the apartment houses come women who should be young but have faces like stale beer ; men with pulled-down. hats and quick eyes that look the street over behind the cupped hand that shields the match flame ; worn intellectuals with cigarette coughs and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unwavering eyes ; cokies and coke peddlers ; people who look like nothing in particular and know it , and once in a while even men that actually go to work . But they come out early , when the wide cracked sidewalks are empty and still have dew on them . I was earlier than four-thirty getting over there , but not much . I parked at the end of the street , where the funicular railway comes struggling up the yellow clay bank from Hill Street , and walked along Court Street to the Florence Apartments . It was dark brick in front , three stories , the lower windows at sidewalk level and masked by rusted screens and66 the high windowdingy net curtains . The entrance door had a glass panel and enough of the name left to be read . I opened it and went down three brass bound steps into a hallway you could touch on both sides without stretching . Dim doors painted with numbers in dim paint . An alcove at the foot of the stairs with a pay telephone . A sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallway a screen door and in the alley beyond it four tall battered garbage pails in a line , with a dance of flies in the sunlit air above them . I went up the stairs . The radio I had heard over the telephonewas still blatting the baseball game . I read numbers and went up front . Apartment 204 was on the right side and the baseball game was right across the hall from it . I knocked , got no answer and knocked louder . Behind my back three Dodgers struck out against a welter of synthetic crowd noise . I knocked a third time and looked out of the front hall windowwhile I felt in my pocket for the key George Anson Phillips had given me . Across the street was an Italian funeral home , neat and quiet and reticent , white painted brick , flush with the sidewalk . Pietro Palermo Funeral Parlors . The thin green script of a neon sign lay across its facade , with a chaste air . A tall man in dark clothes came out of the front door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had dark skin and a handsome head of iron-gray hair brushed back from his forehead . He got out what looked at that distance to be a silver or platinum and black enamel cigarette case , opened it languidly with two long brown fingers and selected a gold-tipped cigarette . He put the case away and lit the cigarette with a pocket lighter that seemed to match the case . He put that away and folded his arms and stared at nothing with half-closed eyes . From the tip of his motionlessthe high window 67cigarette a thin wisp of smoke rose straight up past his face , as thin and straight as the smoke of a dying campfire at dawn . Another batter struck out or flied out behind my back in the recreated ball game . I turned from watching the tall Italian , put the key into the door of Apartment 204 and went in . A square room with a brown carpet , very little furniture and that not inviting . The wall bed with the usual distorting mirror faced me as I opened the door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reefer party . There was a birchwood easy chair with some hard looking upholsterybeside it in the form of a davenport . A table before the window held a lamp with a shirred paper shade . There was a door on either side of the bed . The door to the left led into a small kitchenette with a brown woodstone sink and a three-burner stove and an old electric icebox that clicked and began to throb in torment just as 1 pushed the door open . On the woodstone drain board stood the remains of somebody 's breakfast , mud at the bottom of a cup , a burnt crust of bread , crumbs on a board , a yellow slime of melted butter down the slope of a saucer , a smeared knife and a granite coffee pot that smelled like sacks in a hot barn . I went back around the wall bed and through the other door . It gave on a short hallway with an open space for clothes and a built-in dresser . On the dresser was a comb and a black brush with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a can of talcum , a small flashlight with a cracked lens , a pad of writing paper , a bank pen , a bottle of ink on a blotter , cigarettes and matches in a glass ashtray that containedhalf a dozen stubs . In the drawers of the dresser were about what one suitcase68 the high windowwould hold in the way of socks and underclothes and handkerchiefs . There was a dark gray suit on a hanger , not new but still good , and a pair of rather dusty black brogues on the floor under it . I pushed the bathroom door . It opened about a foot and then stuck . My nose twitched and I could feel my lips stiffen and I smelled the harsh sharp bitter smell from beyond the door . I leaned against it . It gave a little , but came back , as though somebody was holding it against me . I poked my head through the opening . The floor of the bathroom was too short for him , so his knees were poked up and hung outwards slackly and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , not tilted up , but jammed tight . His brown suit was rumpled a little and his dark glasses stuck out of his breast pocket at an unsafe angle . As if that mattered . His right hand was thrown across his stomach , his left hand lay on the floor , palm up , the fingers curled a little . There was a blood-caked bruise on the right side of his head , in the blond hair . His open mouth was full of shiny crimson blood . The door was stopped by his leg . I pushed hard and edged around it and got in . I bent down to push two fingers into the side of his neck against the big artery . No artery throbbed there , or even whispered . Nothing at all . The skin was icy . It could n't have been icy . I just thought it was . I straightened up and leaned my back against the door and made hard fists in my pockets and smelled the cordite fumes . The baseballgame was still going on , but through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked down at him . Nothing in that , Marlowe , nothing at all . Nothing for you here , nothing . You did n't even know him . Get out , get out fast. the high window 69I pulled away from the door and pulled it open and went back through the hall into the living room . A face in the mirror looked at me . A strained , leering face . I turned away from it quickly and took out the flat key George Anson Phillips had given me and rubbed it between my moist palms and laid it down beside the lamp . I smeared the doorknob opening the door and the outside knob closing the door . The Dodgers were ahead seven to three , the first half of the eighth . A lady who sounded well on with her drinking was singing Frankie and Johnny , the roundhouse version , in a voice that even whiskey had failed to improve . A deep man 's voice growled at her to shut up and she kept on singing and there was a hard quick movementacross the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing and the baseball game went right on . I put the cigarette in my mouth and lit it and went back down the stairs and stood in the half dark of the hall angle looking at the little sign that read : Manager , Apt. 106 . I was a fool even to look at it . I looked at it for a long minute , biting the cigarette hard between my teeth . I turned and walked down the hallway towards the back . A small enameled plate on a door said : Manager . I knocked on the door. 9A chair was pushed back , feet shuffled , the door opened . " You the manager ? " " Yeah . " It was the same voice I had heard over the telephone . Talking to Elisha Morningstar . He held an empty smeared glass in his hand . It looked as if somebody had been keeping goldfish in it . He was a lanky70 the high windowman with carroty short hair growing down to a point on his forehead . He had a long narrow head packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His ears were large and might have flapped in a high wind . He had a long nose that would be into things . The whole face was a trained face , a face that would know how to keep a secret , a face that held the effortless composure of a corpse in the morgue . He wore his vest open , no coat , a woven hair watchguard , and round blue sleeve garters with metal clasps . I said : " Mr. Anson ? " " Two-o-four . " " He 's not in . " " What should I do  --  lay an egg ? " " Neat , " I said . " You have them all the time , or is this your birthday ? " " Beat it , " he said . " Drift . " He started to close the door . He opened it again to say : " Take the air . Scram . Push off . " Having made his meaning clear he started to close the door again . I leaned against the door . He leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close together . " Five bucks , " I said . It rocked him . He opened the door very suddenly and I had to take a quick step forward in order not to butt his chin with my head . " Come in , " he said . A living room with a wallbed , everything strictly to specifications , even to the shirred paper lampshade and the glass ashtray . This room was painted egg-yolk yellow . All it needed was a few fat black spiders painted on the yellow to be anybody 's bilious attack . " Sit down , " he said , shutting the door. the high window 71I sat down . We looked at each other with the clear innocenteyes of a couple of used car salesmen . " Beer ? " he said . " Thanks . " " He opened two cans , filled the smeared glass he had been holding , and reached for another like it . I said I would drink out of the can . He handed me the can . " A dime , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his vest and went on looking at me . He pulled a chair over and sat in it and spread his bony upjuttingknees and let his empty hand droop between them . " I ai n't interested in your five bucks , " he said . " That 's fine , " I said . " I was n't really thinking of giving it to you . " " A wisey , " he said . " What gives ? We run a nice respectable place here . No funny stuff gets pulled . " " Quiet too , " I said . " Upstairs you could almost hear an eagle scream . " His smile was wide , about three quarters of an inch . " I do n't amuse easy , " he said . " Just like Queen Victoria , " I said . " I do n't get it . " " I do n't expect miracles , " I said . The meaningless talk had a sort of cold bracing effect on me , making a mood with a hard gritty edge . I got my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't my card . It read : James B. Pollock , Reliance Indemnity Company , Field Agent . I tried to remember what James B. Pollock looked like and where I had met him . I could n't . I handed the carroty man the card . He read it and scratched the end of his nose with one of72 the high windowthe corners . " Wrong john ? " he asked , keeping his green eyes plastered to my face . " Jewelry , " I said and waved a hand . He thought this over . While he thought it over I tried to make up my mind whether it worried him at all . It did n't seem to . " We get one once in a while , " he conceded . " You ca n't help it . He did n't look like it to me , though . Soft looking . " " Maybe I got a hum steer , " I said . I described George Anson Phillips to him , George Anson Phillips alive , in his brown suit and his dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow print band . I wondered what had happened to the hat . It had n't been up there . He must have got rid of it , thinking it was too conspicuous . His blond head was almost , but not quite , as bad . " That sound like him ? " The carroty man took his time making up his mind . Finally he nodded yes , green eyes watching me carefully , lean hard hand holding the card up to his mouth and running the card along his teeth like a stick along the palings of a picket fence . " I did n't figure him for no crook , " he said . " But hell , they come all sizes and shapes . Only been here a month . If he looked like a wrong gee , would n't have been here at all . " I did a good job of not laughing in his face . " What say we frisk the apartment while he 's out ? " He shook his head . " Mr. Palermo would n't like it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Across the street . Owns the funeral parlors . Owns this building and a lot of other buildings . Practically owns the district , if you know what I mean . " " He gave me a twitch of the lip and a flutter of the right eyelid . " Gets the vote out . Not a guy to crowd . " the high window 73 " Well , while he 's getting the vote out or playing with a stiff or whatever he 's doing at the moment , let 's go up and frisk the apartment . " " Do n't get me sore at you , " the carroty man said briefly . " That would bother me like two per cent of nothing at all , " I said . " Let 's go up and frisk the apartment . " I threw my empty beer can at the waste basket and watched it bounce back and roll half way across the room . The carroty man stood up suddenly and spread his feet apart and dusted his hands together and took hold of his lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five , " he shrugged . " That was hours ago , " I said . " I thought better of it . Let 's go up and frisk the apartment . " " Say that just once more  --  " his right hand slid towards his hip . " If you 're thinking of pulling a gun , Mr. Palermo would n't like it , " I said . " To hell with Mr. Palermo , " he snarled , in a voice suddenly furious , out of a face suddenly charged with dark blood . " Mr. Palermo will be glad to know that 's how you feel about him , " I said . " Look , " the carroty man said very slowly , dropping his hand to his side and leaning forward from the hips and pushing his face at me as hard as he could . " Look . I was sitting here having myself a beer or two . Maybe three . Maybe nine . What the hell ? I was n't bothering anybody . It was a nice day . It looked like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He waved a hand violently . " Let 's go up and frisk the apartment , " I said . He threw both fists forward in tight lumps . At the end of the motion he threw his hands wide open , straining the74 the high windowfingers as far as they would go . His nose twitched sharply . " If it was n't for the job , " he said . I opened my mouth . " Do n't say it ! " he yelled . He put a hat on , but no coat , opened a drawer and took out a bunch of keys , walked past me to open the door and stood in it , jerking his chin at me . His face still looked a little wild . We went out into the hall and along it and up the stairs . The ball game was over and dance music had taken its place . Very loud dance music . The carroty man selected one of his keys and put it iii the lock of Apartment 204 . Against the booming of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman 's voice suddenly screamed hysterically . The carroty man withdrew the key and bared his teeth at me . He walked across the narrow hallway and banged on the opposite door . Ile had to knock hard and long before any attention was paid . Then the door was jerked open and a sharp-faced blond in scarlet slacks and a green pullover stared out with sultry eyes , one of which was puffed and the other had been socked several days ago . She also had a bruise on her throat and her hand held a tall cool glass of amber fluid . " Pipe down , but soon , " the carroty man said . " Too much racket . I do n't aim to ask you again . Next time I call some law . " " The girl looked back over her shoulder and screamed against the noise of the radio : " Hey , Del ! The guy says to pipe down ! You wan na sock him ? " A chair squeaked , the radio noise died abruptly and a thick bitter-eyed dark man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way with one hand and pushed histhe high window 75face at us . He needed a shave . He was wearing pants , street shoes and an undershirt . He settled his feet in the doorway , whistled a little breath in through his nose and said : " Buzz off . I just come in from lunch . I had a lousy lunch . I would n't want nobody to push muscle at me . " He was very drunk , but in a hard practised sort of way . The carroty man said : " You heard me , Mr. Hench . Dim that radio and stop the roughhouse in here . And make it sudden . " The man addressed as Hench said : " Listen , picklepuss  --  " and heaved forward with his right foot in a hard stamp . The carroty man 's left foot did n't wait to be stamped on . The lean body moved back quickly and the thrown bunch of keys hit the floor behind , and clanked against the door of Apartment 204 . The carroty man 's right hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackjack . Hench said : " Yah ! " and took two big handfuls of air in his two hairy hands , closed the hands into fists and swung hard at nothing . The carroty man hit him on the top of his head and the girl screamed again and threw a glass of liquor in her boy friend 's face . Whether because it was safe to do it now or because she made an honest mistake , I could n't tell . Hench turned blindly with his face dripping , stumbled and ran across the floor in a lurch that threatened to land him on his nose at every step . The bed was down and tumbled . Hench made the bed on one knee and plunged a hand under the pillow . I said : " Look out  --  gun . " " I can fade that too , " the carroty man said between his ' 76 the high windowteeth and slid his right hand , empty now , under his open vest . Hench was down on both knees . He came up on one and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right hand and he was staring down at it , not holding it by the grip at all , holding it flat on his palm . " Drop it ! " the carroty man 's voice said tightly and he went on into the room . The blond promptly jumped on his back and wound her long green arms around his neck , yelling lustily . The carroty man staggered and swore and waved his gun around . " Get him , Del ! " the blond screamed . " Get him good ! " Hench , one hand on the bed and one foot on the floor , both knees doubled , right hand holding the black gun flat on his palm , eyes staring down at it , pushed himself slowly to his feet and growled deep in his throat : " This ai n't my gun . " I relieved the carroty man of the gun that was not doing him any good and stepped around him , leaving him to shake the blond off his back as best he could . A door banged down the hallway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Drop it , Hench . " He looked up at me , puzzled dark eyes suddenly sober . " It ai n't my gun , " he said and held it out flat . " Mine 's a Colt .32-belly gun . " I took the gun off his hand . He made no effort to stop me . He sat down on the bed , rubbed the top of his head slowly , and screwed his face up in difficult thought . " Where the hell  --  " his voice trailed off and he shook his head and winced . I sniffed the gun . It had been fired . I sprang the magazine out and counted the bullets through the small holes in the side . There were six . With one in the magazine , that madethe high window 77seven . The gun was a Colt .32 , automatic , eight shot . It had been fired . If it had not been reloaded , one shot had been fired from it . The carroty man had the blond off his back now . He had thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cheek . His green eyes were baleful . " Better get some law , " I said . " A shot has been fired from this gun and it 's about time you found out there 's a dead man in the apartment across the hall . " Hench looked up at me stupidly and said in a quiet , reasonablevoice : " Brother , that simply ai n't my gun . " The blond sobbed in a rather theatrical manner and showed me an open mouth twisted with misery and ham acting . The carroty man went softly out of the door . I  --  " Shot in the throat with a medium caliber gun and a soft nosed bullet , " Detective-Lieutenant Jesse Breeze said . " A gun like this and bullets like is in here . " He danced the gun on his hand , the gun Hench had said was not his gun . " Bulletranged upwards and probably hit the back of the skull . Still inside his head . The man 's dead about two hours . Hands and face cold , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something hard before being shot . Likely with a gun butt . All that mean anything to you boys and girls ? " The newspaper he was sitting on rustled . He took his hat off and mopped his face and the top of his almost bald head . A fringe of light colored hair around the crown was damp and dark with sweat . He put his hat back on , a flatcrownedPanama , burned dark by the sun . Not this year's78 the high windowhat , and probably not last year 's . He was a big man , rather paunchy , wearing brown and white shoes and sloppy socks and white trousers with thin black stripes , an open neck shirt showing some gingercoloredhair at the top of his chest , and a rough sky-blue sports coat not wider at the shoulders than a two-car garage . He would be about fifty years old and the only thing about him that very much suggested cop was the calm , unwinking unwavering stare of his prominent pale blue eyes , a stare that had no thought of being rude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rude . Below his eyes across the top of his cheeks and the bridge of his nose there was a wide path of freckles , like a mine field on a war map . We were sitting in Ilench 's apartment and the door was shut . Hench had his shirt on and he was absently tying a tie with thick blunt fingers that trembled . The girl was lying on the bed . She had a green wrap-around thing twisted about her head , a purse by her side and a short squirrel coat across her feet . Her mouth was a little open and her face was drained and shocked . Hench said thickly : " If the idea is the guy was shot with the gun under the pillow , okay . Seems like he might have been . It ai n't my gun and nothing you boys can think up is going to make me say it 's my gun . " " Assuming that to be so , " Breeze said , " how come ? Somebodyswiped your gun and left this one . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We went out about three-thirty or so to get something to eat at the hashhouse around the corner , " Hench said . " You can check that . We must have left the door unlocked . We were kind of hitting the bottle a little . I guess we were prettythe high window 79noisy . We had the ball game going on the radio . I guess we shut it off when we went out . I 'm not sure . You remember ? " He looked at the girl lying white-faced and silent on the bed . " You remember , sweet ? " The girl did n't look at him or answer him . " She 's pooped , " Hench said . " I had a gun , a Colt .32 , same caliber as that , but a belly gun . A revolver , not an automatic . There 's a piece broken off the rubber grip . A Jew named Morris gave it to me three four years ago . We worked together in a bar . I do n't have no permit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Breeze said : " Hitting the hooch like you birds been and having a gun under the pillow sooner or later somebody was going to get shot . You ought to know that . " " Hell , we did n't even know the guy , " Hench said . His tie was tied now , very badly . He was cold sober and very shaky . He stood up and picked a coat off the end of the bed and put it on and sat down again . I watched his fingers tremble lightinga cigarette . " We do n't know his name . We do n't know anything about him . I see him maybe two three times in the hall , but he do n't even speak to me . It 's the same guy , I guess . I ai n't even sure of that . " " It 's the fellow that lived there , " Breeze said . " Let me see now , this ball game is a studio re-broadcast , huh ? " " Goes on at three , " Hench said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We went out about the last half the third . We was gone about an inning and a half , maybe two . Twenty minutes to half an hour . Not more . " " I guess he was shot just before you went out , " Breeze said . " The radio would kill the noise of the gun near enough . You must of left your door unlocked . Or even open . " 80 the high window " Could be , " Hench said wearily . " You remember , honey ? " Again the girl on the bed refused to answer him or even look at him . Breeze said : " You left your door open or unlocked . The killer heard you go out . He got into your apartment , wanting to ditch his gun , saw the bed down , walked across and slipped his gun under the pillow , and then imagine his surprise . He found another gun there waiting for him . So he took it along . Now if lie meant to ditch his gun , why not do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of going into another apartment to do it ? Why the fancy pants ? " I was sitting in the corner of the davenport by the window . I put in my nickel 's worth , saying : " Suppose he had locked himself out of Phillips ' apartment before he thought of ditching the gun ? Suppose , coming out of the shock of his murder , he found himself in the hall still holding the murder gun . He would want to ditch it fast . Then if Hench 's door was open and he had heard them go out along the hall  --  " Breeze looked at me briefly and grunted : " I 'm not saying it is n't so . I 'm just considering . " FIe turned his attention back to Hench . " So now , if this turns out to be the gun that killed Anson , we got to try and trace your gun . While we do that we got to have you and the young lady handy . You understand that , of course ? " Hench said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard enough to make me tell it different . " " We can always try , " Breeze said mildly . " And we might just as well get started . " He stood up , turned and swept the crumpled newspapers off the chair on to the floor . He went over to the door , then turned and stood looking at the girl on the bed . " You all right , sister , or should I call for a matron ? " the high window 81The girl on the bed did n't answer him . Hench said : " I need a drink . I need a drink bad . " " Not while I 'm watching you , " Breeze said and went out of the door . Hench moved across the room and put the neck of a bottle into his mouth and gurgled liquor . He lowered the bottle , looked at what was left in it and went over to the girl . He pushed her shoulder . " Wake up and have a drink , " he growled at her . The girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or show that she had heard him . " Let her alone , " I said . " Shock . " Hench finished what was in the bottle , put the empty bottle down carefully and looked at the girl again , then turned his back on her and stood frowning at the floor . " Jeeze , I wish I could remember better , " he said under his breath . Breeze came back into the room with a young fresh-faced plainclothes detective . " This is Lieutenant Spangler , " he said . " He 'll take you down . Get going , huh ? " Hench went back to the bed and shook the girl 's shoulder . " Get on up , babe . We got ta take a ride . " The girl turned her eyes without turning her head , and looked at him slowly . She lifted her shoulders off the bed and put a hand under her and swung her legs over the side and stood up , stamping her right foot , as if it was numb . " Tough , kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . The girl put a hand to her mouth and bit the knuckle of her little finger , looking at him blankly . Then she swung the hand suddenly and hit him in the face as hard as she could . Then she half ran out of the door . Hench did n't move a muscle for a long moment . There was a confused noise of men talking outside , a confused noise of82 the high windowcars down below in the street . Hench shrugged and cocked his heavy shoulders back and swept a slow look around the room , as if he did n't expect to see it again very soon , or at all . Then he went out past the young fresh-faced detective . The detective went out . The door closed . The confused noise outside was dimmed a little and Breeze and I sat looking at each other heavily. 11After a while Breeze got tired of looking at me and dug a cigar out of his pocket . Ile slit the cellophane band with a knife and trimmed the end of the cigar and lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and holding the burning match away from it while he stared thoughtfully at nothing and drew on the cigar and made sure it was burning the way he wanted it to burn . Then he shook the match out very slowly and reached over to lay it on the sill of the open window . Then he looked at me some more . " You and me , " he said , " are going to get along . " " That 's fine , " I said . " You do n't think so , " he said . " But we are . But not because I took any sudden fancy to you . It 's the way I work . Everythingin the clear . Everything sensible . Everything quiet . Not like that dame . That 's the kind of dame that spends her life looking for trouble and when she finds it , it 's the fault of the first guy she can get her fingernails into . " " He gave her a couple of shiners , " I said . " That would n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , " Breeze said , " that you know a lot about dames. " the high window 83 " Not knowing a lot about them has helped me in my business , " I said . " I 'm open-minded . " He nodded and examined the end of his cigar . He took a piece of paper out of his pocket and read from it . " Delmar B. Hench , 45 , bartender , unemployed . Maybelle Masters , 26 , dancer . That 's all I know about them . I 've got a hunch there ai n't a lot more to know . " " You do n't think he shot Anson ? " I asked . Breeze looked at me without pleasure . " Brother , I just got here . " He took a card out of his pocket and read from that . " James B. Pollock , Reliance Indemnity Company , Field Agent . What 's the idea ? " " In a neighborhood like this it 's bad form to use your own name , " I said . " Anson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the neighborhood ? " " Practically everything , " I said . " What I would like to know , " Breeze said , " is what you know about the dead guy ? " " I told you already . " " Tell me again . People tell me so much stuff I get it all mixed up . " " I know what it says on his card , that his name is George Anson Phillips , that he claimed to be a private detective . He was outside my office when I went to lunch . He followed me downtown , into the lobby of the Hotel Metropole . I led him there . I spoke to him and he admitted he had been following me and said it was because he wanted to find out if I was smart enough to do business with . That 's a lot of baloney , of course . He probably had n't quite made up his mind what to do and was waiting for something to decide him . He was on a job  --  he said  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high window with somebody , perhaps somebody with a little more experiencethan he had , if he had any at all . He did n't act as if he had . " Breeze said : " And the only reason he picked on you is that six years ago you worked on a case in Ventura while he was a deputy up there . " I said , " That 's my story . " " But you do n't have to get stuck with it , " Breeze said calmly . " You can always give us a better one . " " It 's good enough , " I said . " I mean it 's good enough in the sense that it 's bad enough to be true . " He nodded his big slow head . " What 's your idea of all this ? " he asked . " Have you investigated Phillips ' office address ? " He shook his head , no . " My idea is you will find out he was hired because he was simple . He was hired to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something that turned out to be not what he liked . He was scared . He wanted a friend , he wanted help . The fact that he picked me after so long a time and such little knowledge of me showed he did n't know many people in the detective business . " Breeze got his handkerchief out and mopped his head and face again . " But it do n't begin to show why he had to follow you around like a lost pup instead of walking right up to your office door and in . " " No , " I said , " it does n't . " " Can you explain that ? " " No . Not really . " " Well , how would you try to explain it ? " " I 've already explained it in the only way I know how . He was undecided whether to speak to me or not . He was waitthehigh window 85ing for something to decide him . I decided by speaking to him . " " Breeze said : " That is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You may be right , " I said . " And as the result of this little hotel lobby conversationthis guy , a total stranger to you , asks you to his apartment and hands you his key . Because he wants to talk to you . " I said , " Yes . " " Why could n't he talk to you then ? " " I had an appointment , " I said . " Business ? " I nodded . " I see . What you working on ? " I shook my head and did n't answer . " This is murder , " Breeze said . " You 're going to have to tell me . " I shook my head again . He flushed a little . " Look , " he said tightly , " you got to . " " I 'm sorry , Breeze , " I said . " But so far as things have gone , I 'm not convinced of that . " " Of course you know I can throw you in the can as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds ? " " On the grounds that you are the one who found the body , that you gave a false name to the manager here , and that you do n't give a satisfactory acccount of your relations with the dead guy . " I said : " Are you going to do it ? " He smiled bleakly . " You got a lawyer ? " " I know several lawyers . I do n't have a lawyer on a retainer basis . " 86 the high window " How many of the commissioners do you know person-ally ? " " None . That is , I 've spoken to three of them , but they might not remember me . " " But you have good contacts , in the mayor 's office and so on ? " " Tell me about them , " I said . " I 'd like to know . " " Look , buddy , " he said earnestly , " you must got some friends somewhere . Surely . " " I 've got a good friend in the Sheriff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . " He lifted his eyebrows . " Why ? Maybe you 're going to need friends . A good word from a cop we know to be right might go a long way . " " He 's just a personal friend , " I said . " I do n't ride around on his back . If I get in trouble , it wo n't do him any good . " " How about the homicide bureau ? " " There 's Randall , " I said . " If he 's still working out of CentralHomicide . I had a little time with him on a case once . But he does n't like me too well . " Breeze sighed and moved his feet on the floor , rustling the newspapers he had pushed down out of the chair . " Is all this on the level  --  or are you just being smart ? I mean about all the important guys you do n't know ? " " It 's on the level , " I said . " But the way I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart to say so right out . " " I think it is . " He put a big freckled hand over the whole lower part of his face and squeezed . When he took the hand away there were round red marks on his cheeks from the pressure of thumb and fingers . I watched the marks fade. the high window 87 " Why do n't you go on home and let a man work ? " he asked crossly . I got up and nodded and went towards the door . Breeze said to my back : " Gim me your home address . " I gave it to him . He wrote it down . " So long , " he said drearily : " Do n't leave town . We 'll want a statement  --  maybe tonight . " I went out . There were two uniformed cops outside on the landing . The door across the way was open and a fingerprint man was still working inside . Downstairs I met two more cops in the hallway , one at each end of it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front door . There was an ambulance pulling away from the curb . A knot of people hung around on both sides of the street , not as many as would accumulate in some neighborhoods . I pushed along the sidewalk . A man grabbed me by the arm and said : " What 's the damage , Jack ? " I shook his arm off without speaking or looking at his face and went on down the street to where my car was. 12It was a quarter to seven when I let myself into the office and clicked the light on and picked a piece of paper off the floor . It was a notice from the Green Feather Messenger Service saying that a package was held awaiting my call and would be delivered upon request at any hour of the day or night . I put it on the desk , peeled my coat off and opened the windows . I got a half bottle of Old Taylor out of the deep drawer of the desk and drank a short drink , rolling it around on my tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool bottle and wondering how it would feel to be a homicide dick88 the high window and find bodies lying around and not mind at all , not have to sneak out wiping doorknobs , not have to ponder how much I could tell without hurting a client and how little I could tell without too badly hurting myself . I decided I would n't like it . I pulled the phone over and looked at the number on the slip and called it . They said my package could be sent right over . I said I would wait for it . It was getting dark outside now . The rushing sound of the traffic had died a little and the air from the open window , not yet cool from the night , had that tired end-of-the-day smell of dust , automobile exhaust , sunlight rising from hot walls and sidewalks , the remote smell of food in a thousand restaurants , and perhaps , drifting down from the residential hills above I lollywood  --  if you had a nose like a hunting dog  --  a touch of that peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I sat there smoking . Ten minutes later the door was knocked on and I opened it to a boy in a uniform cap who took my signature and gave me a small square package , not more than two and a half inches wide , if that . I gave the boy a dime and listened to him whistling his way back to the elevators . The label had my name and address printed on it in ink , in a quite fair imitation of typed letters , larger and thinner than pica . I cut the string that tied the label to the box and unwound the thin brown paper . Inside was a thin cheap cardboard box pasted over with brown paper and stamped Made in Japan with a rubber stamp . It would be the kind of box you would get in a Jap store to hold some small carved animal or a small piece of jade . The lid fitted down all the way and tightly . I pulled it off and saw tissue paper and cotton wool. the high window 89Separating these I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half dollar , bright and shining as if it had just come from the mint . The side facing me showed a spread eagle with a shield for a breast and the initials E.B. punched into the left wing . Around these was a circle of beading , between the beading and the smooth unmilled edge of the coin , the legend E PLUBIBUS UNUM . At the bottom was the date 1787 . I turned the coin over on my palm . It was heavy and cold and my palm felt moist under it . The other side showed a sun rising or setting behind a sharp peak of mountain , then a double circle of what looked like oak leaves , then more Latin , NOVA EBORACA COLUMBIA EXCELSIOR . At the bottom of thisside , in smaller capitals , the name BRASHER . I was looking at the Brasher Doubloon . There was nothing else in the box or in the paper , nothing on the paper . The handwritten printing meant nothing to me . I did n't know anybody who used it . I filled an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tissue paper , snapped a rubber band around it and tucked it into the tobacco in the pouch and put more in on top . I closed the zipper and put the pouch in my pocket . I locked the paper and string and box and label up in a filing cabinet , sat down again and dialed Elisha Morningstar 's number on the phone . The bell rang eight times at the other end of the line . It was not answered . I hardly expected that . I hung up again , looked Elisha Morningstar up in the book and saw that he had no listing for a residence phone in Los Angeles or the outlying towns that were in the phone book . I got a shoulder holster out of the desk and strapped it on and slipped a Colt .38 automatic into it , put on hat and coat , shut the windows again , put the whiskey away , clicked the90 the high windowlights off and had the office door unlatched when the phone rang . The ringing bell had a sinister sound , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which it rang . I stood there braced and tense , lips tightly drawn back in a half grin . Beyondthe closed window the neon lights glowed . The dead air did n't move . Outside the corridor was still . The bell rang in darkness , steady and strong . I went back and leaned on the desk and answered . There was a click and a droning on the wire and beyond that nothing . I depressed the connection and stood there in the dark , leaning over , holding the phone with one hand and holding the flat riser on the pedestal down with the other . I did n't know what I was waiting for . The phone rang again . I made a sound in my throat and put it to my ear again , not saying anything at all . So we were there silent , both of us , miles apart maybe , each one holding a telephone and breathing and listening and hearing nothing , not even the breathing . Then after what seemed a very long time there was the quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone : " Too bad for you , Marlowe . " Then the click again and the droning on the wire and I hung up and went back across the office and out. 13I drove west on Sunset , fiddled around a few blocks without making up my mind whether anyone was trying to follow me , then parked near a drugstore and went into its phone booth . I dropped my nickel and asked the 0-operator for a Pasathehigh window 91dena number . She told me how much money to put in . The voice which answered the phone was angular and cold . " Mrs. Murdock 's residence . " " Philip Marlowe here . Mrs. Murdock , please . " I was told to wait . A soft but very clear voice said : " Mr. Marlowe ? Mrs. Murdock is resting now . Can you tell me what it is ? " " You ought n't to have told him . " " I  --  who  --  ? " " That loopy guy whose handkerchief you cry into . " " How dare you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me talk to Mrs. Murdock . I have to . " " Very well . I 'll try . " The soft clear voice went away and I waited a long wait . They would have to lift her up on the pillows and drag the port bottle out of her hard gray paw and feed her the telephone . A throat was cleared suddenly over the wire . It sounded like a freight train going through a tunnel . " This is Mrs. Murdock . " " Could you identify the property we were talking about this morning , Mrs. Murdock ? I mean could you pick it out from others just like it ? " " Well  --  are there others just like it ? " " There must be . Dozens , hundreds for all I know . Anyhow dozens . Of course I do n't know where they are . " She coughed . " I do n't really know much about it . I suppose I could n't identify it then . But in the circumstances  --  " " That 's what I 'm getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on tracing the history of the article back to you . At least to be convincing . " " Yes . I suppose it would . Why ? Do you know where it is ? " 92 the high window " Morningstar claims to have seen it . He says it was offered to him for sale  --  just as you suspected . He would n't buy . The seller was not a woman , he says . That does n't mean a thing , because he gave me a detailed description of the party which was either made up or was a description of somebody he knew more than casually . So the seller may have been a woman . " " I see . It 's not important now . " " Not important ? " " No . Have you anything else to report ? " " Another question to ask . Do you know a youngish blond fellow named Cc'orge Anson Phillips ? Rather heavy set , wearing a brown suit and a dark pork pie hat with a gay band . Wearing that today . Claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . Why should I ? " " I do n't know . He enters the picture somewhere . I think he was the one who tried to sell the article . Morningstar tried to call him up after I left . I snuck back into his office and overheard . " " You what ? " " I snuck . " " Please do not be witty , Mr. Marlowe . Anything else ? " " Yes , I agreed to pay Morningstar one thousand dollars for the return of the  --  the article . He said he could get it for eight hundred ... " " And where were you going to get the money , may I ask ? " " Well , I was just talking . This Morningstar is a downy bird . That 's the kind of language he understands . And then again you might have wanted to pay it . I would n't want to persuadeyou . You could always go to the police . But if for any reason you did n't want to go to the police , it might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it back . " the high window 93I would probably have gone on like that for a long time , not knowing just what I was trying to say , if she had n't stopped me with a noise like a seal barking . " This is all very unnecessary now , Mr. Marlowe . I have decided to drop the matter . The coin has been returned to me . " Hold the wire a minute , " I said . I put the phone down on the shelf and opened the booth door and stuck my head out , filling my chest with what they were using for air in the drugstore . Nobody was paying any attention to me . Up front the druggist , in a pale blue smock , was chatting across the cigar counter . The counter boy was polishing glasses at the fountain . Two girls in slacks were playing the pinball machine . A tall narrow party in a black shirt and a pale yellow scarf was fumbling magazines at the rack . He did n't look like a gunman . I pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " A rat was gnawing my foot . It 's all right now . You got it back , you said . Just like that . How ? " " I hope you are not too disappointed , " she said in her uncompromisingbaritone . " The circumstances are a little difficult . I may decide to explain and I may not . You may call at the house tomorrow morning . Since I do not wish to proceed with the investigation , you will keep the retainer as payment in full . " " Let me get this straight , " I said . " You actually got the coin back  --  not a promise of it , merely ? " " Certainly not . And I 'm getting tired . So , if you  --  " " One moment , Mrs. Murdock . It is n't going to be as simple as all that . Things have happened . " " In the morning you may tell me about them , " she said sharply , and hung up. 94 the high window I pushed out of the booth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went back along the store . The druggist was alone now . He was sharpening a pencil with a small knife , very intent , frowning . " That 's a nice sharp pencil you have there , " I told him . He looked up , surprised . The girls at the pinball machine looked at me , surprised . I went over and looked at myself in the mirror behind the counter . I looked surprised . I sat down on one of the stools and said : " A double Scotch , straight . " The counter man looked surprised . " Sorry , this is n't a bar , sir . You can buy a bottle at the liquor counter . " " So it is , " I said . " I mean , so it is n't . I 've had a shock . I 'm a little dazed . Give me a cup of coffee , weak , and a very thin ham sandwich on stale bread . No , I better not eac yet either . Good-by . " I got down off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was as loud as a ton of coal going down a chute . The man in the black shirt and yellow scarf was sneering at me over the New Republic . " You ought to lay off that fluff and get your teeth into something solid , like a pulp magazine , " I told him , just to be friendly . I went on out . Behind me somebody said : " Hollywood 's full of them . " 14The wind had risen and had a dry taut feeling , tossing the tops of trees , and making the swung arc light up the side street cast shadows like crawling lava . I turned the car and drove east again. the high window 95The hock shop was on Santa Monica , near Wilcox , a quiet old-fashioned little place , washed gently by the lapping waves of time . In the front window there was everything you could think of , from a set of trout flies in a thin wooden box to a portable organ , from a folding baby carriage to a portraitcamera with a four-inch lens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a Single Action Frontier Colt , .44 caliber , the model they still make for Western peace officers whose grandfathers taught them how to file the triggerand shoot by fanning the hammer back . I went into the shop and a bell jangled over my head and somebody shuffled and blew his nose far at the back and steps came . An old Jew in a tall black skull cap came along behind the counter , smiling at me over cut out glasses . I got my tobacco pouch out , got the Brasher Doubloon out of that and laid it on the counter . The window in front was clear glass and I felt naked . No paneled cubicles with handcarvedspittoons and doors that locked themselves as you closed them . The Jew took the coin and lifted it on his hand . " Gold , is it ? A gold hoarder you are maybe , " he said , twinkling . " Twenty-five dollars , " I said . " The wife and the kiddies are hungry . " " Oi , that is terrible . Gold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe platinum it could be . " He weighed it casually on a pair of small scales . " Gold it is , " he said . " So ten dollars you are wanting ? " " Twenty-five dollars . " " For twenty-five dollars what would I do with it ? Sell it , maybe ? For fifteen dollars worth of gold is maybe in it . Okay . Fifteen dollars . " " You got a good safe ? " 96 the high window " Mister , in this business are the best safes money can buy . Nothing to worry about here . It is fifteen dollars , is it ? " " Make out the ticket . " He wrote it out partly with his pen and partly with his tongue . I gave my true name and address . Bristol Apartments , 1634 North Bristol Avenue , Hollywood . " You are living in that district and you are borrowing fifteendollars , " the Jew said sadly , and tore off my half of the ticket and counted out the money . I walked down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen and mailed the pawnticket to myself . I was hungry and hollow inside . I went over to Vine to eat , and after that I drove downtown again . The wind was still rising and it was drier than ever . The steering wheel had a gritty feeling under my fingers and the inside of my nostrils felt tight and drawn . The lights were on here and there in the tall buildings . The green and chromium clothier 's store on the corner of Ninth and Hill was a blaze of it . In the Belfont Building a few windows glowed here and there , but not many . The same old plowhorse sat in the elevator on his piece of folded burlap , looking straight in front of him , blank-eyed , almost gathered to history . I said : " I do n't suppose you know where I can get in touch with the building superintendent ? " He turned his head slowly and looked past my shoulder . " I hear how in Noo York they got elevators that just whiz . Go thirty floors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noo York . " " The hell with New York , " I said . " I like it here . " " Must take a good man to run them fast babies . " " Do n't kid yourself , dad . All those cuties do is push butthehigh window 97tons , say Good Morning , Mr. Whoosis , ' and look at their beauty spots in the car mirror . Now you take a Model T job like this  --  it takes a man to run it . Satisfied ? " " I work twelve hours a day , " he said . " And glad to get it . " " Do n't let the union hear you . " " You know what the union can do ? " I shook my head . He told me . Then he lowered his eyes until they almost looked at me . " Did n't I see you before somewhere ? " " About the building super , " I said gently . " Year ago he broke his glasses , " the old man said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where could I get in touch with him this time of the evening ? " He looked at me a little more directly . " Oh , the building super ? He 's home , ai n't he ? " " Sure . Probably . Or gone to the pictures . But where is home ? What 's his name ? " " You want something ? " " Yes . " I squeezed a fist in my pocket and tried to keep from yelling . " I want the address of one of the tenants . The tenant I want . the address of is n't in the phone book  --  at his home . I mean where he lives when he 's not in his office . You know , home . " I took my hands out and made a shape in the air , writing the letters slowly , h o m e . The old man said : " Which one ? " It was so direct that it jarred me . " Mr. Morningstar . " " He ai n't home . Still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure I 'm sure . I do n't notice people much . But he 's old like me and I notice him . He ai n't been down yet . " I got into the car and said : " Eight . " 98 the high window He wrestled the doors shut and we ground our way up . He did n't look at me anymore . When the car stopped and I got out he did n't speak or look at me again . He just sat there blank-eyed , hunched on the burlap and the wooden stool . As I turned the angle of the corridor he was still sitting there . And the vague expression was back on his face . At the end of the corridor two doors were alight . They were the only two in sight that were . I stopped outside to light a cigarette and listen , but I did n't hear any sound of activity . I opened the door marked Entrance and stepped into the narrow office with the small closed typewriter desk . The wooden door was still ajar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said : " Mr. Morningstar . " No answer . Silence . Not even a sound of breathing . The hairs moved on the back of my neck . I stepped around the door . The ceiling light glowed down on the glass cover of the jeweller 's scales , on the old polished wood around the leather desk top , down the side of the desk , on a squaretoed , elastic-sided black shoe , with a white cotton sock above it . The shoe was at the wrong angle , pointing to the corner of the ceiling . The rest of the leg was behind the corner of the big safe . I seemed to be wading through mud as I went on into the room . He lay crumpled on his back . Very lonely , very dead . The safe door was wide open and keys hung in the lock of the inner compar tinent . A metal drawer was pulled out . It was empty now . There may have been money in it once . Nothing else in the room seemed to be different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I did n't touch him except to bend over and put the back of my hand against his livid , violet-colored face . It was like touching athe high window 99frog 's belly . Blood had oozed from the side of his forehead where he had been hit . But there was no powder smell on the air this time , and the violet color of his skin showed that he had died of a heart stoppage , due to shock and fear , probably . That did n't make it any less murder . I left the lights burning , wiped the doorknobs , and walked down the fire stairs to the sixth floor . I read the names on the doors going along , for no reason at all . H. R. Teager Dental Laboratories , L. Pridview , Public Accountant , Dalton and Rees Typewriting Service , Dr. E. I. Blaskowitz , and underneaththe name in small letters : Chiropractic Physician . The elevator came growling up and the old man did n't look at me . His face was as empty as my brain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no name. 15The chessmen , red and white bone , were lined up ready to go and had that sharp , competent and complicated look they always have at the beginning of a game . It was ten o'clock in the evening , I was home at the apartment , I had a pipe in my mouth , a drink at my elbow and nothing on my mind except two murders and the mystery of how Mrs. Elizabeth Bright Murdock had got her Brasher Doubloon back while I still had it in my pocket . I opened a little paper-bound book of tournament games published in Leipzig , picked out a dashing-looking Queen 's Gambit , moved the white pawn to Queen 's four , and the bell rang at the door . I stepped around the table and picked the Colt .38 off the drop leaf of the oak desk and went over to the door holding it down beside my right leg. 100 the high window " Who is it ? " " Breeze . " " I went back to the desk to lay the gun down again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as big and sloppy as ever , but a little more tired . The young , freshfaceddick named Spangler was with him . They rode me back into the room without seeming to and Spangler shut the door . Ilis bright young eyes flicked this way and that while Breeze let his older and harder ones stay on my face for a long moment , then he walked around me to the davenport . " Look around , " he said out of the corner of his mouth . Spangler left the door and crossed the room to the dinette , looked in there , recrossed and went into the hall . The bathroom door squeaked , his steps went farther along . Breeze took his hat off and mopped his semi-bald dome . Doors opened and closed distantly . Closets . Spangler came back . " Nobody here , " he said . Breeze nodded and sat down , placing his panama beside him . Spangler saw the gun lying on the desk . He said : " Mind if I look ? " I said : " Phooey on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and held the muzzle to his nose , sniffing . He broke the magazine out , ejected the shell in the chamber , picked it up and pressed it into the magazine . He laid the magazine on the desk and held the gun so that light went into the open bottom of the breech . Holding it that way he squinted down the barrel . " A little dust , " he said . " Not much . " " What did you expect ? " I said . " Rubies ? " the high window 104 . He ignored me , looked at Breeze and added : " I 'd say this gun has not been fired within twenty-four hours . I 'm sure of it . " Breeze nodded and chewed his lip and explored my face with his eyes . Spangler put the gun together neatly and laid it aside and went and sat down . He put a cigarette between his lips and lit it and blew smoke contentedly . " We know damn well it was n't a long .38 anyway , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall . No chance of the slug staying inside a man 's head . " " Just what are you guys talking about ? " I asked . Breeze said : " The usual thing in our business . Murder . Have a chair . Relax . I thought I heard voices in here . Maybe it was the next apartment " " Maybe , " I said . " You always have a gun lying around on your desk ? " " Except when it 's under my pillow , " I said . " Or under my arm . Or in the drawer of the desk . Or somewhere I ca n't just remember where I happened to put it . That help you any ? " " We did n't come here to get tough , Marlowe . " " That 's fine , " I said . " So you prowl my apartment and handle my property without asking my permission . What do you do when you get tough  --  knock me down and kick me in the face ? " " Aw hell , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all grinned . Then Breeze said : " Use your phone ? " I pointed to it . He dialed a number and talked to someone named Morrison , saying : " Breeze at  --  " He looked down at the base of the phone and read the number off  --  " Anytime now . Marlowe is the name that goes with it . Sure . Five or ten minutes is okay . " 102 the high window He hung up and went back to the davenport . " I bet you ca n't guess why we 're here . " " I 'm always expecting the brothers to drop in , " I said . " Murder ai n't funny , Marlowe . " " Who said it was ? " " Do n't you kind of act as if it was ? " " I was n't aware of it . " He looked at Spangler and shrugged . Then he looked at the floor . Then he lifted his eyes slowly , as if they were heavy , and looked at inc again . I was sitting down by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chess ? " he asked , looking at the chessmen . " Not a lot . Once in a while I fool around with a game here , thinking things out . " " Do n't it take two guys to play chess ? " " I play over tournament games that have been recorded and published . There 's a whole literature about chess . Once in a while I work out problems . They 're not chess , properly speaking . What are we talking about chess for ? Drink ? " " Not right now , " Breeze said . " I talked to Randall about you . He remembers you very well , in connection with a case down at the beach . " He moved his feet on the carpet , as if they were very tired . His solid old face was lined and gray with fatigue . " He said you would n't murder anybody . He says you are a nice guy , on the level . " " That was friendly of him , " I said . " He says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late in the mornings and are apt to run to a very bright line of chatter and that we should believe anything you say , providedwe can check it by five independent witnesses . " " To hell with him , " I said. the high window 103Breeze nodded exactly as though I had said just what he wanted me to say . He was n't smiling and he was n't tough , just a big solid man working at his job . Spangler had his head back on the chair and his eyes half closed and was watching the smoke from his cigarette . " Randall says we should look out for you . He says you are not as smart as you think you are , but that you are a guy things happen to , and a guy like that could be a lot more trouble than a very smart guy . That 's what he says , you understand . You look all right to me . I like everything in the clear . That 's why I 'm telling you . " I said it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Breeze , but he did n't move , so I reached for it and answered it . It was a girl 's voice . I thought it was vaguely familiar , but I could n't place it . " Is this Mr. Philip Marlowe ? " " Yes . " " Mr. Marlowe , I 'm in trouble , very great trouble . I want to see you very badly . When can I see you ? " I said : " You mean tonight ? Who am I talking to ? " " My name is Gladys Crane . I live at the Hotel Normandy on Rampart . When can you  --  " " You mean you want me to come over there tonight ? " I asked , thinking about the voice , trying to place it . " I  --  " The phone clicked and the line was dead . I sat there holding it , frowning at it , looking across it at Breeze . His face was quietly empty of interest . " Some girl says she 's in trouble , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the base of the phone waiting for it to ring again . The two cops were completely silent and motionless . Too silent , too motionless . The bell rang again and I let the plunger up and said : " You104 the high windowwant to talk to Breeze , do n't you ? " " Yeah . " It was a man 's voice and it sounded a little surprised . " Go on , be tricky , " I said , and got up from the chair and went out to the kitchen . 1 heard Breeze talking very briefly then the sound of the phone being returned to the cradle . I got a bottle of Four Hoses out of the kitchen closet and three glasses . I got ice and ginger ale from the icebox and mixed three highballs and carried them in on a tray and sat the tray down on the cocktail table in front of the davenport where Breeze was sitting . 1 took two of the glasses , handed one to Spangler , and took the other to my chair . Spangler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumb and finger , looking at Breeze to see whether he would accept the drink . Breeze looked at me very steadily . Then he sighed . Then he picked the glass up and tasted it and sighed again and shook his head sideways with a half smile ; the way a mar does when you give him a drink and he needs it very badly and it is just right and the first swallow is like a peek into a cleaner , sunnier , brighter world . " I guess you catch on pretty fast , Mr. Marlowe , " he said , and leaned back on the davenport completely relaxed . " I guess now we can do some business together . " " Not that way , " I said . " Huh ? " He bent his eyebrows together . Spangler leaned forward in his chair and looked bright and attentive . " Having stray broads call me up and give me a song and dance so you can say they said they recognized my voice somewhere sometime . " " The girl 's name is Gladys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I never heard of her . " the high window 105 " Okay , " Breeze said . " Okay . " He showed me the flat of his freckled hand . " We 're not trying to pull anything that 's not legitimate . We only hope you ai n't , either . " " Ai n't either what ? " " Ai n't either trying to pull anything not legitimate . Such as holding out on us . " " Just why should n't I hold out on you , if I feel like it ? " I asked . " You 're not paying my salary . " " Look , do n't get tough , Marlowe . " " I 'm not tough . I do n't have any idea of being tough . I know enough about cops not to get tough with them . Go ahead and speak your piece and do n't try to pull any more phonies like that telephone call . " " We 're on a murder case , " Breeze said . " We have to try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . You had talked to the guy . He had asked you to come to his apartment . He gave you his key . You said you did n't know what he wanted to see you about . We figured that maybe with time to think back you could have remembered . " " In other words I was lying the first time , " I said . Breeze smiled a tired smile . " You been around enough to know that people always lie in murder cases . " " The trouble with that is how are you going to know when I stop lying ? " " When what you say begins to make sense , we 'll be satisfied . " I looked at Spangler . He was leaning forward so far he was almost out of his chair . IIe looked as if he was going to jump . I could n't think of any reason why he should jump , so I thought he must be excited . I looked back at Breeze . He was about as excited as a hole in the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick fingers and106 the high windowhe was slitting the cellophane with a penknife . I watched him get the wrapping off and trim the cigar end with the blade and put the knife away , first wiping the blade carefully on his pants . I watched him strike a wooden match and light the cigar carefully , turning it around in the flame , then hold the match away from the cigar , still burning , and draw on the cigar until he decided it was properly lighted . Then he shook the match out and laid it down beside the crumpled cellophane on the glass top of the cocktail table . Then he leaned back and pulled up one leg of his pants and smoked peacefully . Every motion had been exactly as it had been when he lit a cigar in I lench 's apartment , and exactly as it always would be whenever he lit a cigar . He was that kind of man , and that made him dangerous . Not as dangerous as a brilliant man , but much more dangerous than a quick excitable one like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " I do n't count that he said he saw me up in Ventura once , because I do n't remember him . I met him just the way I told you . He tailed me around and I braced him . He wanted to talk to me , he gave me his key , I went to his apartment , used the key to let myself in when he did n't answer  --  as he had told me to do . He was dead . The police were called and through a set of events or incidents that had nothing to do with me , a gun was found under Hench 's pillow . A gun that had been fired . I told you this and it 's true . " " Breeze said : " When you found him you went down to the apartment manager , guy named Passmore , and got him to go up with you without telling him anybody was dead . You gave Passmore a phony card and talked about jewelry . " I nodded . " With people like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a little on the cagey side. the high window 107I was interested in Phillips . I thought Passmore might tell me something about him , if he did n't know he was dead , that he would n't be likely to tell me , if he knew the cops were going to bounce in on him in a brief space of time . That 's all there was to that . " Breeze drank a little of his drink and smoked a little of his cigar and said : " What I 'd like to get in the clear is this . Everything you just told us might be strictly the truth , and yet you might not be telling us the truth . If you get what I mean . " " Like what ? " I asked , getting perfectly well what he meant . He tapped on his knee and watched me with a quiet up from under look . Not hostile , not even suspicious . Just a quiet man doing his job . " Like this . You 're on a job . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at being a private dick . He was on a job . He tailed you around . How can we know , unless you tell us , that his job and your job do n't tie in somewhere ? And if they do , that 's our business . Right ? " " That 's one way to look at it , " I said . " But it 's not the only way , and it 's not my way . " " Do n't forget this is a murder case , Marlowe . " " I 'm not . But do n't you forget I 've been around this town a long time , more than fifteen years . I 've seen a lot of murder cases come and go . Some have been solved , some could n't be solved , and some could have been solved that were not solved . And one or two or three of them have been solved wrong . Somebody was paid to take a rap , and the chances are it was known or strongly suspected . And winked at . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Consider a case like the Cassidy case . I guess you remember it , do n't you ? " 108 the high windowBreeze looked at his watch . " I 'm tired , " he said . " Let 's forget the Cassidy case . Let 's stick to the Phillips case . " I shook my head . " I 'm going to make a point , and it 's an important point . Just look at the Cassidy case . Cassidy was a very rich man , a multimillionaire . He had a grown up son . One night the cops were called to his home and young Cassidy was on his back on the floor with blood all over his face and a bullet hole in the side of his head . His secretary was lying on his back in an adjoining bathroom , with his head against the second bathroom door , leading to a hall , and a cigarette burned out between the fingers of his left hand , just a short burned out stub that had scorched the skin between his fingers . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot in the head , not a contact wound . A lot of drinking had been done . Four hours had elapsed since the deaths and the family doctor had been there for three of them . Now , what did you do with the Cassidy case ? " Breeze sighed . " Murder and suicide during a drinking spree . The secretary went haywire and shot young Cassidy . I read it in the papers or something . Is that what you want me to say ? " " You read it in the papers , " I said , " but it was n't so . What 's more you knew it was n't so and the D.A . knew it was n't so and the D.A . ' s investigators were pulled off the case within a matter of hours . There was no inquest . But every crime reporter in town and every cop on every homicide detail knew it was Cassidy that did the shooting , that it was Cassidythat was crazy drunk , that it was the secretary who tried to handle him and could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but was n't quick enough . Cassidy 's was a contact wound and the secretary 's was not . The secretary was left-handed and he had a cigarette in his left hand whenthe high window 109he was shot . Even if you are right-handed , you do n't change a cigarette over to your other hand and shoot a man while casually holding the cigarette . They might do that on Gang Busters , but rich men 's secretaries do n't do it . And what were the family and the family doctor doing during the four hours they did n't call the cops ? Fixing it so there would only be a superficial investigation . And why were no tests of the hands made for nitrates ? Because you did n't want the truth . Cassidywas too big . But this was a murder case too , was n't it ? " " The guys were both dead , " Breeze said . " What the hell difference did it make who shot who ? " " Did you ever stop to think , " I asked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister or a sweetheart  --  or all three ? That they had their pride and their faith and their love for a kid who was made out to be a drunken paranoiacbecause his boss 's father had a hundred million dol-lars ? " Breeze lifted his glass slowly and finished his drink slowly and put it down slowly and turned the glass slowly on the glass top of the cocktail table . Spangler sat rigid , all shining eyes and lips parted in a sort of rigid half smile . Breeze said : " Make your point . " I said : " Until you guys own your own souls you do n't own mine . Until you guys can be trusted every time and always , in all times and conditions , to seek the truth out and find it and let the chips fall where they may  --  until that time comes , I have a right to listen to my conscience , and protectmy client the best way I can . Until I 'm sure you wo n't do him more harm than you 'll do the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make me talk . " Breeze said : " You sound to me just a little like a guy who is trying to hold his conscience down . " 110 the high window " Hell , " I said . " Let 's have another drink . And then you can tell me about that girl you had me talk to on the phone . " He grinned : " That was a dame that lives next door to Phillips . She heard a guy talking to him at the door one evening . She works days as an usherette . So we thought maybe she ought to hear your voice . Think nothing of it . " " What kind of voice was it ? " " Kind of a mean voice . She said she did n't like it . " " I guess that 's what made you think of me , " I said . I picked up the three glasses and went out to the kitchenwith them. 16When I got out there I had forgotten which glass was which , so I rinsed them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks when Spangler strolled out and stood just behind my shoulder . " It 's all right , " I said . " I 'm not using any cyanide this evening . " " Do n't get too foxy with the old guy , " he said quietly to the back of my neck . " He knows more angles than you think . " " Nice of you , " I said . " Say , I 'd like to read up on that Cassidy case , " he said . " Sounds interesting . Must have been before my time . " " It was a long time ago , " I said . " And it never happened . I was just kidding . " I put the glasses on the tray and carried them back into the living room and set them around . I took mine over to my chair behind the chess table . " Another phony , " I said . " Your sidekick sneaks out to the kitchen and gives me advice behind your back about howthe high window 111careful I ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think you know . He has just the right face for it . Friendly and open and an easy blusher . " Spangler sat down on the edge of his chair and blushed . Breeze looked at him casually , without meaning . " What did you find out about Phillips ? " I asked . " Yes , " Breeze said . " Phillips . Well , George Anson Phillips is a kind of pathetic case . He thought he was a detective , but it looks as if he could n't get anybody to agree with him . I talked to the sheriff at Ventura . He said George was a nice kind , maybe a little too nice to make a good cop , even if he had any brains . George did what they said and he would do it pretty well , provided they told him which foot to start on and how many steps to take which way and little things like that . But he did n't develop much , if you get what I mean . He was the sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chicken thief , if he saw the guy steal the chicken and the guy fell down running away and hit his head on a post or something and knocked himself out . Otherwise it might get a little tough and George would have to go back to the office for instructions . Well , it wore the sheriff down after a while and he let George go . " Breeze drank some more of his drink and scratched his chin with a thumbnail like the blade of a shovel . " After that George worked in a general store at Simi for a man named Sutcliff . It was a credit business with little books for each customer and George would have trouble with the books . He would forget to write the stuff down or write it in the wrong book and some of the customers would straighten him out and some would let George forget . So Sutcliff thought maybe George would do better at something else , and George came to L.A. He had come into a little money , not112 the high windowmuch , but enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bond and get himself a piece of an office . I was over there . What he had was desk room with another guy who claims he is selling Christmas cards . Name of Marsh . If George had a customer , the arrangement was Marsh would go for a walk . Marsh says he did n't know where George lived and George did n't have any customers . That is , no business came into the office that Marsh knows about . But George put an ad in the paper and he might have got a customer out of that . I guess he did , because about a week ago Marsh found a note on his desk that George would he out of town for a few days . That 's the last he heard of him . So George went over to Court Street and took an apartment tinder the name of Anson and got bumped off . And that 's all we know about George so far . Kind of a pathetic case . " He looked at me with a level uncurious gaze and raised his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Breeze put the glass down and dug a thin piece of paper out of his wallet and put it down on the cocktail table . I went over and picked it up and read it . It said : Why worry ? Why be doubtful or confused ? Why be gnawed by suspicion ? Consult cool , careful , confidential , discreet investigator . George Anson Phillips . Glenview 9521 . I put it down on the glass again . " It ai n't any worse than lots of business personals , " Breeze said . " It do n't seem to be aimed at the carriage trade . " Spangler said : " The girl in the office wrote it for him . She said she could hardly keep from laughing , but George thought it was swell . The Hollywood Boulevard office of the Chronicle . " " You checked that fast , " I said. the high window 113 " We do n't have any trouble getting information , " Breeze said . " Except maybe from you . " ' What about Hench ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a liquor party . They would drink a little and sing a little and scrap a little and listen to the radio and go out to eat once in a while , when they thought of it . I guess it had been going on for days . Just as well we stopped it . The girl has two bad eyes . The next round Hench might have broken her neck . The world is full of bums like Hench  --  and his girl . " " What about the gun Hench said was n't his ? " " It 's the right gun . We do n't have the slug yet , but we have the shell . It was under George 's body and it checks . We had a couple more fired and comparisoned the ejector marks and the firing pin dents . " " You believe somebody planted it under Hench 's pillow ? " " Sure . Why would Hench shoot Phillips ? He did n't know him . " " How do you know that ? " " I know it , " Breeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are things you know because you have them down in black and white . And there are things you know because they are reasonable and have to be so . You do n't shoot somebody and then make a lot of racket calling attention to yourself , and all the time you have the gun under your pillow . The girl was with Hench all day . If Hench shot anybody , she would have some idea . She does n't have any such idea . She would spill , if she had . What is Hench to her ? A guy to play around with , no more . Look , forget Hench . The guy who did the shooting hears the loud radio and knows it will cover a shot . But all the same he saps Phillips and drags him into the bathroom and shuts the door before he shoots114 the high windowhim . He 's not drunk . He 's minding his own business , and careful . He goes out , shuts the bathroom door , the radio stops , Hench and the girl go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you know the radio stopped ? " " I was told , " Breeze said calmly . " Other people live in that dump . Take it the radio stopped and they went out . Not quiet . The killer steps out of the apartment and Hench 's door is open . That must be because otherwise he would n't think anything about I Tench 's door . " " People do n't leave their doors open in apartment houses . Especially in districts like that . " " Drunks do . Drunks are careless . Their minds do n't focus well . And they only think of one thing at a time . The door was open  --  just a little maybe , but open . The killer went in and ditched his gun on the bed and found another gun there . He took that away , just to make it look worse for Hench . " " You can check the gun , " I said . " Hench 's gun ? We 'll try to , but Hench says he does n't know the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . I doubt it . The gun we have we will try to check , but you know how those things are . You get just so far along and you think it is going to open up for you , and then the trail dies out cold . A dead end . Anything else you can think of that we might know that might be a help to you in your business ? " " I 'm getting tired , " I said . " My imagination is n't working very well . " " You were doing fine a while back , " Breeze said . " On the Cassidy case . " I did n't say anything . I filled my pipe up again but it wasthe high window 115too hot to light . I laid it on the edge of the table to cool off . " It 's God 's truth , " Breeze said slowly , " that I do n't know what to make of you . I ca n't see you deliberately covering up on any murder . And neither can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretend to know . " I did n't say anything , again . Breeze leaned over to revolve his cigar butt in the tray until he had killed the fire . He finished his drink , put on his hat and stood up . " How long you expect to stay dummied up ? " he asked . " I do n't know . " " Let me help you out . I give you till tomorrow noon , a little better than twelve hours . I wo n't get my post mortem report before that anyway . I give you till then to talk things over with your party and decide to come clean . " " And after that ? " " After that I see the Captain of Detectives and tell him a private eye named Philip Marlowe is withholding informationwhich I need in a murder investigation , or I 'm pretty sure he is . And what about it ? I figure he 'll pull you in fast enough to singe your breeches . " I said : " Uh-huh . Did you go through Phillips ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feller . Nothing in it at all , except a little kind of diary . Nothing in that either , except about how he went to the beach or took some girl to the pictures and she did n't warm up much . Or how he sat in the office and no business come in . One time he got a little sore about his laundry and wrote a whole page . Mostly it was just three or four lines . There was only one thing about it . It was all done in a kind of printing . " I said : " Printing ? " " Yeah , printing in pen and ink . Not big block caps like116 the high windowpeople trying to disguise things . Just neat fast little printing as if the guy could write that way as fast and easy as any way . " " He did n't write like that on the card he gave me , " I said . Breeze thought about that for a moment . Then he nodded . " True . Maybe it was this way . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front . Maybe the printing was just a little game he played with himself . " " Like Pepys ' shorthand , " I said . " What was that ? " " A diary a man wrote in a private shorthand , a long time ago . " Breeze looked at Spangler , who was standing up in front of his chair , tipping the last few drops of his glass . " We better heat it , " Breeze said . " This guy is warming up for another Cassidy case . " Spangler put his glass down and they both went over to the door . Breeze shuffled a foot and looked at me sideways , with his hand on the doorknob . " You know any tall blonds ? " " I 'd have to think , " I said . " I hope so . How tall ? " " Just tall . I do n't know how tall that is . Except that it would be tall to a guy who is tall himself . A wop named Palermo owns that apartment house on Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funeral parlors . He owns them too . He says he saw a tall blond come out of the apartment house about three-thirty . The manager , Passmore , do n't place anybody in the joint that he would call a tall blond . The wop says she was a looker . I give some weight to what he says because he give us a good description of you . He did n't see this tall blond go in , just saw her come out . Shethe high window 117was wearing slacks and a sports jacket and a wrap-around . But she had light blond hair and plenty of it under the wrap-around . " " Nothing comes to me , " I said . " But I just remembered something else . I wrote the license number of Phillips ' car down on the back of an envelope . That will give you his former address , probably . I 'll get it . " They stood there while I went to get it out of my coat in the bedroom . I handed the piece of envelope to Breeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his billfold . " So you just thought of this , huh ? " " That 's right . " " Well , well , " he said . " Well , well . " The two of them went along the hallway towards the elevator , shaking their heads . I shut the door and went back to my almost untasted second drink . It was flat . I carried it to the kitchen and hardened it up from the bottle and stood there holding it and looking out of the window at the eucalyptus trees tossingtheir limber tops against the bluish dark sky . The wind seemed to have risen again . It thumped at the north window and there was a heavy slow pounding noise on the wall of the building , like a thick wire banging the stucco between insulators . I tasted my drink and wished I had n't wasted the fresh whiskey on it . I poured it down the sink and got a fresh glass and drank some ice water . Twelve hours to tie up a situation which I did n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let the cops go to work on her and her whole family . Hire Marlowe and get your house full of law . Why worry ? Why be doubtful118 the high window and confused ? Why be gnawed by suspicion ? Consult cockeyed , careless , clubfooted , dissipated investigator . Philip Marlowe , Glenview 7537 . See me and you meet the best cops in town . Why despair ? Why be lonely ? Call Marlowe and watch the wagon come . This did n't get me anywhere either . I went back to the living room and put a match to the pipe that had cooled off now on the edge of the chess table . I drew the smoke in slowly , but it still tasted like the smell of hot rubber . I put it away and stood in the middle of the floor pulling my lower lip out and letting it snap back against my teeth . The telephone rang . I picked it up and growled into it . " Marlowe ? " The voice was a harsh low whisper . It was a harsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " Talk it up whoever you are . Whose pocket have I got my hand in now ? " " Maybe you 're a smart guy , " the harsh whisper said . " Maybeyou would like to do yourself some good . " " How much good ? " " Say about five C 's worth of good . " " That 's grand , " I said . " Doing what ? " " Keeping your nose clean , " the voice said . " Want to talk about it ? " " Where , when , and who to ? " " Idle Valley Club . Morny . Any time you get here . " " Who are you ? " A dim chuckle came over the wire . " Just ask at the gate for Eddie Prue . " The phone clicked dead . I hung it up . It was near eleven-thirty when I backed my car out of the garage and drove towards Cahuenga Pass. the high window 11917About twenty miles north of the pass a wide boulevard with flowering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran for five blocks and died  --  without a house in its entire length . From its end a curving asphalt road dove into the hills . This was Idle Valley . Around the shoulder of the first hill there was a low white building with a tiled roof beside the road . It had a roofed porch and a floodlighted sign on it read : Idle Valley Patrol . Open gates were folded back on the shoulders of the road , in the middle of which a square white sign standing on its point said STOP in letters sprinkled with reflector buttons . Another floodlight blistered the space of road in front of the sign . I stopped . A uniformed man with a star and a strapped-on gun in a woven leather holster looked at my car , then at a board on a post . He came over to the car . " Good evening . I do n't have your car . This is a private road . Visiting ? " " Going to the club . " " Which one ? " " Idle Valley Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call it here . You mean Mr. Morny 's place ? " " Right . " " You 're not a member , I guess . " " No . " " I have to check you in . To somebody who is a member or to somebody who lives in the valley . All private property here , you know . " " No gate crashers , huh ? " 120 the high window He smiled . " No gate crashers . " " The name is Philip Marlowe , " I said . " Calling on Eddie Prue . " " Prue ? " " He 's Mr. Morny 's secretary . Or something . " " Just a minute , please . " He went to the door of the building , and spoke . Another uniformed man inside , plugged in on a PBX . A car came up behind me and honked . The clack of a typewriter came from the open door of the patrol office . The man who had spoken to me looked at the honking car and waved it in . It slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green long open convertible sedan with three dizzy-looking dames in the front seat , all cigarettes and arched eyebrows and go-to-hell expressions . The car flashed around a curve and was gone . The uniformed man came back to me and put a hand on the car door . " Okay , Mr. Marlowe . Check with the officer at the club , please . A mile ahead on your right . There 's a lighted parking lot and the number on the wall . Just the number . Eighty-seven Seventy-seven . Check with the officer there , please . " I said : " Why would I do that ? " He was very calm , very polite , and very firm . " We have to know exactly where you go . There 's a great deal to protect in Idle Valley . " " Suppose I do n't check with him ? " " You kidding me ? " His voice hardened . " No . I just wanted to know . " " A couple of cruisers would start looking for you . " " How many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " About a mile ahead on the right , Mr. Marlowe . " the high window 121I looked at the gun strapped to his hip , the special badge pinned to his shirt . " And they call this a democracy , " I said . He looked behind him and then spat on the ground and put a hand on the sill of the car door . " Maybe you got company , " he said . " I knew a fellow belonged to the John Reed Club . Over in Boyle Heights , it was . " " Tovarich , " I said . " The trouble with revolutions , " he said , " is that they get in the hands of the wrong people . " " Check , " I said . " On the other hand , " he said , " could they be any wronger than the bunch of rich phonies that live around here ? " " Maybe you 'll be living in here yourself someday , " I said . He spat again . " I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year and let me sleep in chiffon pajamas with a string of matched pink pearls around my neck . " " I 'd hate to make you the offer , " I said . " You make me the offer any time , " he said . " Day or night . Just make me the offer and see what it gets you . " " Well , I 'll run along now and check with the officer of the club , " I said . " Tell him to go spit up his left pants leg , " he said . " Tell him I said so . " " I 'll do that , " I said . A car came up behind and honked . I drove on . Half a block of dark limousine blew me off the road with its horn and went past me making a noise like dead leaves falling . The wind was quiet out here and the valley moonlight was so sharp that the black shadows looked as if they had been cut with an engraving tool . Around the curve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white houses built up and down the hills , ten122 the high windowthousand lighted windows and the stars hanging down over them politely , not getting too close , on account of the patrol . The wall of the club building that faced the road was white and blank , with no entrance door , no windows on the lower floor . The number was small but bright in violet-colored neon . 8777 . Nothing else . To the side , under rows of hooded , downward-shining lights , were even rows of cars , set out in the white lined slots on the smooth black asphalt . Attendantsin crisp clean uniforms moved in the lights . The road went around to the back . A deep concrete porch there , with an overhanging canopy of glass and chromium , but very dim lights . 1 got out of the car and received a check with the license number on it , carried it over to a small desk where a uniformed man sat and dumped it in front of him . " Philip Marlowe , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He wrote the name and numberdown , handed me back my check and picked up a telephone . A Negro in a white linen doublebreasted guards uniform , gold epaulettes , a cap with a broad gold band , opened the door for me . The lobby looked like a high-budget musical . A lot of light and glitter , a lot of scenery , a lot of clothes , a lot of sound , an all-star cast , and a plot with all the originality and drive of a split fingernail . Under the beautiful soft indirect lighting the walls seemed to go up forever and to be lost in soft lascivious stars that really twinkled . You could just manage to walk on the carpet without waders . At the back was a free-arched stairway with a chromium and white enamel gangway going up in wide shallow carpeted steps . At the entrance to the dining room a chubby captain of waiters stood negligently with a two-inch satin stripe on his pantsthe high window 123and a bunch of gold-plated menus under his arm . He had the sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost without moving a muscle . The bar entrance was to the left . It was dusky and quiet and a bartender moved mothlike against the faint glitter of piled glassware . A tall handsome blond in a dress that looked like seawater sifted over with gold dust came out of the Ladies ' Room touching up her lips and turned toward the arch , humming . The sound of rhumba music came through the archway and she nodded her gold head in time to it , smiling . A short fat man with a red face and glittering eyes waited for her with a white wrap over his arm . He dug his thick , fingers into her bare arm and leered up at her . A check girl in peach-bloom Chinese pajamas came over to take my hat and disapprove of my clothes . She had eyes like strange sins . A cigarette girl came down the gangway . She wore an egret plume in her hair , enough clothes to hide behind a toothpick , one of her long beautiful naked legs was silver , and one was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dame who makes her dates by long distance . I went into the bar and sank into a leather bar seat packed with down . Glasses tinkled gently , lights glowed softly , there were quiet voices whispering of love , or ten per cent , or whatever they whisper about in a place like that . A tall fine-looking man in a gray suit cut by an angel suddenlystood up from a small table by the wall and walked over to the bar and started to curse one of the barmen . He cursed him in a loud clear voice for a long minute , calling him about nine names that are not usually mentioned by tall fine-looking men in well cut gray suits . Everybody stopped124 the high windowtalking and looked at him quietly . His voice cut through the muted rhumba music like a shovel through snow . The barman stood perfectly still , looking at the man . The barman had curly hair and a clear warm skin and wide-set careful eyes . He did n't move or speak . The tall man stopped talking and stalked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barman . The barman moved slowly along the bar to the end where I sat and stood looking away from me , with nothing in his face but pallor . Then he turned to me and said : " Yes , sir ? " " I want to talk to a fellow named Eddie Prue . " " So ? " " He works here , " I said . " Works here doing what ? " His voice was perfectly level and as dry as dry sand . " I understand he 's the guy that walks behind the boss . If you know what I mean . " " Oh . Eddie Prue . " He moved one lip slowly over the other and made small tight circles on the bar with his bar cloth . " Your name ? " " Marlowe . " " Marlowe . Drink while waiting ? " " A dry martini will do . " " A martini . Dry . Veddy , veddy dry . " " Okay . " " Will you eat it with a spoon or a knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " I 'll just nibble it . " " On your way to school , " he said . " Should I put the olive in a bag for you ? " " Sock me on the nose with it , " I said . " If it will make you feel any better . " the high window 125 " Thank you , sir , " he said . " A dry martini . " He took three steps away from me and then came back and leaned across the bar and said : " I made a mistake in a drink . The gentleman was telling me about it . " " I heard him . " " He was telling me about it as gentlemen tell you about things like that . As big shot directors like to point out to you your little errors . And you heard him . " " Yeah , " I said , wondering how long this was going to go on . " He made himself heard  --  the gentleman did . So I come over here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea , " I said . He held up one of his fingers and looked at it thoughtfully . " Just like that , " he said . " A perfect stranger . " " It 's my big brown eyes , " I said . " They have that gentle look . " " Thanks , chum , " he said , and quietly went away . I saw him talking into a phone at the end of the bar . Then I saw him working with a shaker . When he came back with the drink he was all right again. l8I carried the drink over to a small table against the wall and sat down there and lit a cigarette . Five minutes went by . The music that was coming through the fret had changed in tempo without my noticing it . A girl was singing . She had a rich deep down around the ankles contralto that was pleasant to listen to . She was singing Dark Eyes and the band behind her seemed to be falling asleep . There was a heavy round of applause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man at the next table said to his girl : " They got Linda Conquest back with the band . I heard she got married to some rich guy in Pasadena , but it did n't take . " The girl said : " Nice voice . If you like female crooners . " I started to get up but a shadow fell across my table and a man was standing there . A great long gallows of a man with a ravaged face and a haggard frozen right eye that had a clotted iris and the steady look of blindness . He was so tall that he had to stoop to put his hand on the back of the chair across the table from me . He stood there sizing me up without saying anything and I sat there sipping the last of my drink and listening to the contralto voice singing another song . The customers seemed to like corny music in there . Perhaps they were all tired out trying to be ahead of the minute in the place where they worked . " I 'm Prue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I gathered . You want to talk to me , I want to talk to you , and I want to talk to the girl that just sang . " " Let 's go . " There was a locked door at the back end of the bar . Prue unlocked it and held it for me and we went through that and up a flight of carpeted steps to the left . A long straight hallwaywith several closed doors . At the end of it a bright star cross-wired by the mesh of a screen . Prue knocked on a door near the screen and opened it and stood aside for me to pass him . It was a cozy sort of office , not too large . There was a built-in upholstered corner seat by the french windows and a man in a white dinner jacket was standing with his back to the room , looking out . He had gray hair . There was a large black and chromium safe , some filing cases , a large globe inthe high window 127a stand , a small built-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual high-backed padded leather chair behind it . I looked at the ornaments on the desk . Everything standardand all copper . A copper lamp , pen set and pencil tray , a glass and copper ashtray with a copper elephant on the rim , a copper letter opener , a copper thermos bottle on a copper tray , copper corners on the blotter holder . There was a spray of almost copper-colored sweet peas in a copper vase . It seemed like a lot of copper . The man at the window turned around and showed me that he was going on fifty and had soft ash gray hair and plenty of it , and a heavy handsome face with nothing unusualabout it except a short puckered scar in his left cheek that had almost the effect of a deep dimple . I remembered the dimple . I would have forgotten the man . I remembered that I had seen him in pictures a long time ago , at least ten years ago . I did n't remember the pictures or what they were about or what he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face and the puckered scar . His hair had been dark then . He walked over to his desk and sat down and picked up his letter opener and poked at the ball of his thumb with the point . He looked at me with no expression and said : " You 're Marlowe ? " I nodded . " Sit down . " I sat down . Eddie Prue sat in a chair against the wall and tilted the front legs off the floor . " I do n't like peepers , " Morny said . I shrugged . " I do n't like them for a lot of reasons , " he said . " I do n't like them in any way or at any time . I do n't like them when they128 the high windowbother my friends . I do n't like them when they bust in on my wife . " " I did n't say anything . " I do n't like them when they question my driver or when they get tough with my guests , " he said . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I just do n't like them . " " I 'm beginning to get what you mean , " I said . He flushed and his eyes glittered . " On the other hand , " he said , " just at the moment I might have a use for you . It might pay you to play ball with rne . It might be a good idea . It might pay you to keep your nose clean . " " How much might it pay me ? " I asked . " It might pay you in time and health . " " I seem to have heard this record somewhere , " I said . " I just ca n't put a name to it . " He laid the letter opener down and swung open a door in the desk and got a cut glass decanter out . He poured liquid out of it in a glass and drank it and put the stopper back in the decanter and put the decanter back in the desk . " In my business , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would-be tough boys come a nickel a gross . Just mind your business and I 'll mind my business and we wo n't have any trouble . " He lit a cigarette . His hand shook a little . I looked across the room at the tall man sitting tilted against the wall , like a loafer in a country store . He just sat there without motion , his long arms hanging , his lined gray face full of nothing . " Somebody said something about some money , " I said toMorny . " What 's that for ? I know what the bawling out is for . That 's you trying to make yourself think you can scare me . " " Talk like that to me , " Morny said , " and you are liable to bethe high window 129wearing lead buttons on your vest . " " Just think , " I said . " Poor old Marlowe with lead buttons on his vest . " Eddie Prue made a dry sound in his throat that might have been a chuckle . " And as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , " it might be that my business and your business would get a little mixed up together . Through no fault of mine . " " It better not , " Morny said . " In what way ? " He lifted his eyes quickly and dropped them again . " Well , for instance , your hard boy here calling me up on the phone and trying to scare me to death . And later in the evening calling me up and talking about five C 's and how it would do me some good to drive out here and talk to you . And for instance that same hard boy or somebody who looks just like him  --  which is a little unlikely  --  following around after a fellow in my business who happened to get shot this afternoon , on Court Street on Bunker Hill . " Morny lifted his cigarette away from his lips and narrowedhis eyes to look at the tip . Every motion , every gesture , right out of the catalogue . " Who got shot ? " " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't like him . He was a peeper . " I described Phillips to him . " I never heard of him , " Morny said . " And also for instance , a tall blond who did n't live there was seen coming out of the apartment house just after he was killed , " I said . " What tall blond ? " His voice had changed a little . There was urgency in it. 130 the high window " I do n't know that . She was seen and the man who saw her could identify her , if he saw her again . Of course she need not have anything to do with Phillips . " " This man Phillips was a shamus ? " I nodded . " I told you that twice . " " Why was he killed and how ? " " He was sapped and shot in his apartment . We do n't know why he was killed . If we knew that , we would likely know who killed him . It seems to be that kind of a situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The police and myself . I found him dead . So I had to stick around . " Prue let the front legs of his chair down on the carpet very quietly and looked at inc . I its good eye had a sleepy expressionI did n't like . Morny said : " You told the cops what ? " I said : " Very little . I gather from your opening remarks to me here that you know I am looking for Linda Conquest . Mrs. Leslie Murdock . I 've found her . She 's singing here . I do n't know why there should have been any secret about it . It seems to me that your wife or Mr. Vannier might have told me . But they did n't . " " What my wife would tell a peeper , " Morny said , " you could put in a gnat 's eye . " " No doubt she has her reasons , " I said . " However that 's not very important now . In fact it 's not very important that I see Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her a little . If you do n't mind . " " Suppose I mind , " Morny said . " I guess I would like to talk to her anyway , " I said . I got a cigarette out of my pocket and rolled it around in my fingers and admired his thick and still-dark eyebrows . They had athe high window 131fine shape , an elegant curve . Prue chuckled . Morny looked at him and frowned and looked back at me , keeping the frown on his face . " I asked you what you told the cops , " he said . " I told them as little as I could . This man Phillips asked me to come and see him . He implied he was too deep in a job he did n't like and needed help . When I got there he was dead . I told the police that . They did n't think it was quite the whole story . It probably is n't . I have until tomorrow noon to fill it out . So I 'm trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming here , " Morny said . " I got the idea that I was asked to come here . " " You can go to hell back any time you want to , " Morny said . " Or you can do a little job for me  --  for five hundred dollars . Either way you leave Eddie and me out of any conversationsyou might have with the police . " " What 's the nature of the job ? " " You were at my house this morning . You ought to have an idea . " " I do n't do divorce business , " I said . His face turned white . " I love my wife , " he said . " We 've only been married eight months . I do n't want any divorce . She 's a swell girl and she knows what time it is , as a rule . But I think she 's playing with a wrong number at the moment . " " Wrong in what way ? " " I do n't know . That 's what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight , " I said . " Are you hiring me on a job  --  or off a job I already have . " Prue chuckled again against the wall . Morny poured himself some more brandy and tossed it quickly down his throat . Color came back into his face . He did n't answer me. 132 the high window " And let me get another thing straight , " I said . " You do n't mind your wife playing around , but you do n't want her playing with somebody named Vannier . Is that it ? " " I trust her heart , " he said slowly . " But I do n't trust her judgment . Put it that way . " " And you want me to get something on this man Vannier ? " " I want to find out what he is up to . " " Oh . Is he up to something ? " " I think he is . I do n't know what . " " You think he is  --  or you want to think he is ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pulled the middle drawer of his desk out , reached in and tossed a folded paper across to me . I picked it up and unfolded it . It was a carbon copy of a gray billhead . Cal-Western Dental Supply Contpany , and an address . The bill was for 30 lbs . Kerr 's Crystobolite $15.75 , and 25 lbs . White 's Albastone , $7.75 , plus tax . It was made out to H. R. Teager , Will Call , and stamped Paid with a rubber stamp . It was signed for in the corner : L. G. Vannier . I put it down on the desk . " That fell out of his pocket one night when he was here , " Morny said . " About ten days ago . Eddie put one of his big feet on it and Vannier did n't notice he had dropped it . " I looked at Prue , then at Morny , then at my thumb . " Is this supposed to mean something to me ? " " I thought you were a smart detective . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the paper again , folded it and put it in my pocket . " I 'm assuming you would n't give it to me unless it meant something , " I said . Morny went to the black and chromium safe against the wall and opened it . He came back with five new bills spreadthe high window 133out in his fingers like a poker hand . He smoothed them edge to edge , riffled them lightly , and tossed them on the desk in front of me . " There 's your five C 's , " he said . " Take Vannier out of my wife 's life and there will be the same again for you . I do n't care how you do it and I do n't want to know anything about how you do it . Just do it . " I poked at the crisp new bills with a hungry finger . Then I pushed them away . " You can pay me when  --  and if  --  I de- liver , " I said . " I 'll take my payment tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morny did n't touch the money . He lifted the square bottle and poured himself another drink . This time he poured one for me and pushed it across the desk . " And as for this Phillips murder , " I said , " Eddie here was following Phillips a little . You want to tell me why ? " " No . " " The trouble with a case like this is that the information might come from somebody else . When a murder gets into the papers you never know what will come out . If it does , you 'll blame me . " He looked at me steadily and said : " I do n't think so . I was a bit rough when you came in , but you shape up pretty good . I 'll take a chance . " " Thanks , " I said . " Would you mind telling me why you had Eddie call me up and give me the shakes ? " He looked down and tapped on the desk . " Linda 's an old friend of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . He told her you were working for old lady Mur- dock . She told me . I did n't know what the job was . You say you do n't take divorce business , so it could n't be that the old lady hired you to fix anything like that up . " He raised his134 the high windoweyes on the last words and stared at me . I stared back at him and waited . " I guess I 'm just a fellow who likes his friends , " he said . " And does n't want them bothered by dicks . " " Murdock owes you some money , does n't he ? " He frowned . " I do n't discuss things like that . " He finished his drink , nodded and stood up . " I 'll send Linda up to talk to you . Pick your money up . " He went to the door and out . Eddie Prue unwound his long body and stood up and gave me a dim gray smile that meant nothing and wandered off after Morny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ com- pany 's bill again . Something squirmed at the back of my mind , dimly . I walked to the window and stood looking out across the valley . A car was winding up a hill towards a big house with a tower that was half glass brick with light behind it . The headlights of the car moved across it and turned in toward a garage . The lights went out and the valley seemed darker . It was very quiet and quite cool now . The dance band seemed to be somewhere under my feet . It was muffled , and the tune was indistinguishable . Linda Conquest came in through the open door behind me and shut it and stood looking at me with a cold light in her eyes. 19She looked like her photo and not like it . She had the wide cool mouth , the short nose , the wide cool eyes , the dark hair parted in the middle and the broad white line between the parting . She was wearing a white coat over her dress , withthe high window 135the collar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the coat and a cigarette in her mouth . She looked older , her eyes were harder , and her lips seemed to have forgotten to smile . They would smile when she was singing , in that staged artificial smile . But in repose they were thin and tight and angry . She moved over to the desk and stood looking down , as if counting the copper ornaments . She saw the cut glass decanter , took the stopper out , poured herself a drink and tossed it down with a quick flip of the wrist . " You 're a man named Marlowe ? " she asked , looking at me . She put her hips against the end of the desk and crossed her ankles . I said I was a man named Marlowe . " By and large , " she said , " I am quite sure I am not going to like you one damned little bit . So speak your piece and drift away . " " What I like about this place is everything runs so true to type , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shine on the door , the cigarette and check girls , the fat greasy sensual Jew with the tall stately bored showgirl , the well-dressed , drunk and horriblyrude director cursing the barman , the silent guy with the gun , the night club owner with the soft gray hair and the B-picture mannerisms , and now you  --  the tall dark torcher with the negligent sneer , the husky voice , the hard-boiled vocabulary . " She said : " Is that so ? " and fitted her cigarette between her lips and drew slowly on it . " And what about the wise-crackingsnooper with the last year 's gags and the come-hither smile ? " " And what gives me the right to talk to you at all ? " I said . " I 'll bite . What does ? " 136 the high window " She wants it back . Quickly . It has to be fast or there will be trouble . " " " I thought  --  " she started to say and stopped cold . I watched her remove the sudden trace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bending her face over it . " She wants what back , Mr. Marlowe ? " " The Brasher Doubloon . " She looked up at me and nodded , remembering  --  letting me see her remembering . " Oh , the Brasher Doubloon . " " I bet you completely forgot it , " I said . " Well , no . I 've seen it a number of times , " she said . " She wants it back , you said . Do you mean she thinks I took it ? " " Yeah . Just that . " " She 's a dirty old liar , " Linda Conquest said . " What you think does n't make you a liar , " I said . " It only sometimes makes you mistaken . Is she wrong ? " " Why would I take her silly old coin ? " " Well  --  it 's worth a lot of money . She thinks you might need money . I gather she was not too generous . " She laughed , a tight sneering little laugh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murdock would not rate as very " generous . " " Maybe you just took it for spite , kind of , " I said hopefully . " Maybe I ought to slap your face . " She killed her cigarette in Morny 's copper goldfish bowl , speared the crushed stub absently with the letter opener and dropped it into the waste- basket . " Passing on from that to perhaps more important matters , " I said , " will you give him a divorce ? " " For twenty-five grand , " she said , not looking at me , " I should be glad to . " the high window 137 " You 're not in love with the guy , huh ? " " You 're breaking my heart , Marlowe . " " He 's in love with you , " I said . " After all you did marry him . " She looked at me lazily . " Mister , do n't think I did n't pay for that mistake . " She lit another cigarette . " But a girl has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looks . And so a girl can make a mistake , many the wrong guy and the wrong family , looking for something that is n't there . Security , or whatever . " " But not needing any love to do it , " I said . " I do n't want to be too cynical , Marlowe . But you 'd be surprised how many girls marry to find a home , especially girls whose arm muscles are all tired out fighting off the kind of optimists that come into these gin and glitter joints . " " You had a home and you gave it up . " " It got to be too dear . That port-sodden old fake made the bargain too tough . How do you like her for a client ? " " I 've had worse . " She picked a shred of tobacco off her lip . " You notice what she 's doing to that girl ? " " Merle ? I noticed she bullied her . " " It is n't just that . She has her cutting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the old brute has used the effect of it to dominate the girl completely . In company she yells at her but in private she 's apt to be stroking her hair and whispering in her ear . And the kid sort of shivers . " " I did n't quite get all that , " I said . " The kid 's in love with Leslie , but she does n't know it . Emotionally she 's about ten years old . Something funny is going to happen in that family one of these days . I 'm glad I wo n't be there . " I said : " You 're a smart girl , Linda . And you 're tough and138 the high windowyou 're wise . I suppose when you married him you thought you could get your hands on plenty . " " She curled her lip . " I thought it would at least be a vacation . It was n't even that . That 's a smart ruthless woman , Marlowe . Whatever she 's got you doing , it 's not what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your step . " " Would she kill a couple of men ? " She laughed . " No kidding , " I said . " A couple of men have been killed and one of them at least is connected with rare coins . " " I do n't get it , " she looked at me levelly . " Murdered , you mean ? " I nodded . " You tell Morny all that ? " " About one of them . " " You tell the cops ? " " About one of them . The same one . " She moved her eyes over my face . We stared at each other . She looked a little pale , or just tired . I thought she had grown a little paler than before . " You 're making that up , " she said between her teeth . I grinned and nodded . She seemed to relax then . " About the Brasher Doubloon ? " I said . " You did n't take it . Okay . About the divorce , what ? " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , thanks for talking to me . Do you know a fellow named Vannier ? " " Yes . " Her face froze hard now . " Not well . He 's a friend of Lois . " " A very good friend . " " One of these days he 's apt to turn out to be a small quiet funeral too . " the high window 139 " Hints , " I said , " have sort of been thrown in that direction . There 's something about the guy . Every time his name comes up the party freezes . " She stared at me and said nothing . I thought that an idea was stirring at the back of her eyes , but if so it did n't come out . She said quietly : " Morny will sure as hell kill him , if he does n't lay off Lois . " " Go on with you . Lois flops at the drop of a hat . Anybody can see that . " " Perhaps Alex is the one person who ca n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my job anyway . He has no connection with the Murdocks . " She lifted a corner of her lip at me and said : " No ? Let me tell you something . No reason why I should . I 'm just a great big open-hearted kid . Vannier knows Elizabeth Bright Murdockand well . He never came to the house but once while I was there , but he called on the phone plenty of times . I caught some of the calls . He always asked for Merle . " " Well  --  that 's funny , " I said . " Merle , huh ? " She bent to crush out her cigarette and again she speared the stub and dropped it into the wastebasket . " I 'm very tired , " she said suddenly . " Please go away . " I stood there for a moment , looking at her and wondering . Then I said : " Good night and thanks . Good luck . " I went out and left her standing there with her hands in the pockets of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the floor . It was two o'clock when I got back to Hollywood and put the car away and went upstairs to my apartment . The wind was all gone but the air still had that dryness and lightness of the desert . The air in the apartment was dead and Breeze 's cigar butt had made it a little worse than dead . I opened
