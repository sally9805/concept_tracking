Over the teacups at Canada House , off London 's Trafalgar Square , William Lyon Mackenzie King last week told 14 Canadian correspondents that he was happy about his trip to the Empire Conference , about the outcome , about everything . <P> Canada 's Prime Minister had every right to be happy : his stand against Big Power politics had prevailed at the Conference ( TIME , May 22 ) , and he went home with heightened prestige . <P> Modern Mr. Pepys . For clam-like Mackenzie King , the trip had been both a success and an exciting adventure . At the palatial Dorchester Hotel , his London day began at 9 , when he personally answered his personal mail , ended at 11 , when he made his daily entry in the personal diary he has kept faithfully for 25 years . He had much to record . There had been two luncheons at Buckingham Palace : a formal affair during which he sat near Princess Elizabeth , and a private meal with the King &; Queen . He spent a weekend with Churchill at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , politicians like Foreign Secretary Eden and Dominions <P> Secretary Viscount Cranborne . He met Australia 's bluff John Curtin for the first time . <P> The supreme moment came in Parliament 's gilt-crested Royal Gallery last fortnight , when King addressed members of the Houses of Lords and Commons . He had worked and reworked his speech with the little pencil stub he habitually uses . The address was , for him , an unusually succinct statement of his view that each Dominion must be free to go its own way within a loose Commonwealth framework .

Then King went visiting , first privately to an R.C.A.F. bomber group whose squadrons bear the nostalgic names Snowy Owl , Alouette , Thunderbird and Goose . Later , with Canadian High Commissioner Vincent Massey and a retinue of correspondents in attendance , he ate an open-air lunch at a Canadian army camp . A foresighted quartermaster had sent to London for lobster to perk up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Griffin : " . . . the most beautiful meal I have eaten since leaving Canada nearly two years ago . " The Prime Minister reviewed Canadian troops , made no speeches . In 1941 , when the Canadians overseas were edgy and impatient under their long inaction , he addressed them and was roundly booed . This time the troops knew that action could not be long delayed . Cabled the suspicious correspondent of the King-hating Toronto Evening Telegram : " C.O. 's had been primed to caution their men . . . to be on their best behavior . . . . " The only grouse heard from the ranks was the not-so-cryptic remark of a hard-bitten private with no love for dress parades : " I wonder if they can read our thoughts . "
