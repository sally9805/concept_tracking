No sooner had John Lewis lumbered back to the showers than the C.I.O. danced into the ring . Last week it began its impatient fight for a second round of wage boosts . It was armed with a 71-page " report " for which it had paid Robert R. Nathan Associates , Inc. $12,000 . Nathan 's simple conclusion , which neatly fitted the C.I.O. strategy , was that management could indeed pay higher wages-and without raising prices . <P> Planner , Inc . The name-Nathan-was familiar . Shortly after V-J day in 1945 , Robert R. Nathan &; his colleagues in OWMR predicted that there would be 8,000,000 unemployed in the U.S. before spring , 1946 . Later he recommended a general wage increase . He said wages could go up without boosting prices . He was wrong in his prediction . There was no noticeable employment slump . And wages went up , but so did prices in a rising spiral of inflation . <P> Nathan 's experience as a businessman is limited , although he started early enough ; at eight he ran a newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the University of Pennsylvania . From there , he went directly into the Government , where he burgeoned as a New Deal statistician . He advocated all-out production before the war when even the Army was still moving with caution . <P> <P> A large , youngish ( 37 ) man who looks something like a more alert Primo Carnera , he likes to wrestle playfully with friends and pull out their neckties . He became a rabid planner . Last winter , with the general exodus of planners from the Truman Administration , Nathan also left and organized the Robert R. Nathan Associates , Inc . <P> Challenge to Labor . Nathan 's unsurprising findings and explosive conclusions were these : although hourly wage rates have increased , labor 's real wages have gone down because of 1 ) elimination of overtime , and 2 ) rising living costs ( up nearly 20% since January 1945 ) . If the present trend continues , he said , a wage increase of 23% will be necessary to bring real wages back to the January 1945 level . <P> Turning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50% over the war peak of 1943 , and are approaching $15 billion for 1946 ( according to Department of Commerce figures ) . This compares with average annual profits for 1936-39 of a little less than $4 billion . Return on net worth in the last quarter of 1946 , Nathan estimated , will be 9.1% ; this compares with a net return in 1936-39 of 2.9% . <P> In other words , Nathan concluded , U.S. corporations in 1946 made a " lavish profit , " and show every sign of continuing to do the same in 1947 . Therefore , industry can grant labor a substantial wage boost without raising prices . The total boost could be $5.1 billion for workers in manufacturing plants-in percentage , 21% ever present rates . U.S. business as a whole , he figured , could grant a 25% boost . <P> In effect , the " report " asked all U.S. workers : What are you waiting for ? In a way , they were waiting for something just like the Nathan report to spark their long-planned wage drive with " facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
