He was wondrously clever , with a wit that snapped and crackled and never faltered through more than 20 novels . " His pages so teem with fine sayings and magniloquent epigrams , gorgeous images , and fantastic locutions , " said Critic W. E.

" <P> Meredith lived in his little house at Box Hill near London , climbed the hill at dawn to watch the sunrise , went to the City one day each week to his office .
