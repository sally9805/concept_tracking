The Ranee was in London , celebrating at Giro 's with their three pretty daughters . In the House of Commons came an announcement . Ailing , 71 - year- old Sir Charles Vyner Brooke had decided to cede his Sarawak state to Great Britain for one million pounds . <P> Suspicious leaders rose to ask suspicious questions . Labor 's Herbert Morrison countered : " There is something curious about this indignation of the Conservative Party over a little bit of territory 's being added to the British Empire .

The Sarawak people agree to anything the Raja wants . It 's just a case of a few leading ones squatting on the verandah and saying , ' Yes , Raja ! ' But they do n't like Anthony Brooke-he 's got a power complex . If he wants a game of golf , he phones the police to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a game , we walk . " <P> The Raja tried to close the issue raised by the Tories with a letter to the London Times . " All is peace in Sarawak , " he pontificated . " The natives have confidence in myself and my private secretary . "
