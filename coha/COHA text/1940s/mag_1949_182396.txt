It was not so much the defeat in the November elections ( the Republicans were used to defeat ) but the direful question : What was wrong with the Republican Party ? Nobody knew . Pennsylvania 's Republican Governor James Duff thought the party ought " to shed some of the aloofness we have . " Harold Stassen was blunt . " The Republican Party is in a bad way , " he said . " It is sort of like a football team sustaining a crushing defeat after having advanced the ball to the five-yard line . " What Stassen thought the party needed was " a tremendous lot of rebuilding . " <P> A topflight Texas historian thought it would take a lot more than that . Writing in the current Southwest Review , Walter Prescott Webb , longtime professor of history at the University of Texas declared flatly that the great principle of the Republican Party itself was archaic and had been archaic for years . <P> Golden Era . In an article calculated to raise the hackles on Republican necks , Professor Webb looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party in his sights down " the long gunbarrel of history . " Historically , said Webb , " the debate swings around a principle . The party that originates the principle and establishes it , does so in a national crisis . As long as the principle being acted upon works , it is almost impossible to dislodge the party that discovered it . " <P> The Republican Party found such a principle after its triumphant emergence from the Civil War . It embraced " the new and most dynamic force ' ' - business- and the principle that what was good for business was good for the nation . <P> The party protected business against cutthroat domestic competition by granting patents , and against foreign competition by levying tariffs . It won other votes by handouts : land to farmers as free homesteads , Treasury funds to Union soldiers as pensions . It won election after election . " What could you do with a party that had emancipated the slave , saved the Union , given everybody a bounty in land or tariff , assured businessmen of prosperity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Decline ... But by 1900 , the party was forced to choices . " Would it champion the cause of small business or would it go where the power and money were , with Big Business ? " The party chose Big Business . When sharp division arose between employer and employee , says Webb , the party chose the employer . <P> In each case , Webb argues , the party chose to support the minority against the majority . Then the party ran out of homesteads . After that , says Webb , " the Republican Party had no place at all for the farmer ... It compelled him to buy in a protected market and permitted him to sell in a free market with all the world as his competitor . " Observes Webb : " Thus the Republican Party successively turned its back on one great segment of society after another , on the farmer , on small business , on labor . The party quit the people long before the people quit it . "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
