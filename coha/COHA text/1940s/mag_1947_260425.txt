In Manhattan last week , 500 delegates to a convention of the American Naturopathic Association formed the American Vegetarian Party and nominated a 1948 presidential candidate . Their man : Dr. John Maxwell , 84 , Jove-bearded , pint-sized proprietor of a Chicago vegetarian restaurant , who says he has tasted no meat for 45 years . He hoped to get some 5,000,000 votes ; 3,000,000 from vegetarians , the rest from " prohibitionists , anti-vivisectionists , anti-cigaret groups and other people of similar high moral principle . " <P> The prohibitionists already had their own man . The Prohibition Party 's presidential nominee was Dr. Claude A. Watson , 62 , onetime minor league ballplayer , now a Free Methodist preacher in Los Angeles . This was pink-cheeked Dr. Watson 's second try ; he polled 75,000 votes in 1944 . He opened his 1948 campaign last week with a barnstorming tour of dry Kansas , flying in his own plane . He hoped to do better this time . Said he : " If the church people vote like they pray and if the prohibitionists stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
