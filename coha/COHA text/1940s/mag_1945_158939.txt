CBS says it has had thousands of requests for this repeat . Repeat or no , it is radio 's best half hour of thrills &; chills . <P> The story : <P> A nervous , high-strung , bedridden woman ( Agnes Moorehead ) , alone in her Manhattan apartment , keeps phoning her husband at his office , gets nothing but a busy signal . She finally persuades the operator to dial the number for her , is cut in on a conversation between two men making plans for murder .

After a good deal of hysterical hocuspocus , she decides that the two men had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She tries to get the police again , hears the killers in the house . Listeners suddenly hear a shrill , terrifying scream . Then a second of complete silence-so intense that it can almost be heard .

She acts the part without an audience ; during the half hour ( which is almost a monologue ) wears herself to a frazzle.
