RANK A Story ASHER GERECHT T ODAY we learned that our former company commander was killed last night when the jeep he was driving overturned on a curve , It could have been an accident , certainly , but we have known Captain Parmetto too long . He was an excellent driver . I was speaking with the medic who brought him in . He crashed within a hundred yards of our battalion bivouac training area , and Janeira took care of him . He died before they could take him to the aid station . Janeira says that he was drunk , and Parmetto did drink steadily . When my tentmate , Reade , heard about it he said , " Well , I guess that finishes it up . Evens teven . " All day long we have talked about him , in one group or another , and tonight there was a boy here from the company that Locke was in , so that the story of Parmetto and Locke came out again . CAN remember when they both came into the outfit . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to herd the prisoners . We did that for two weeks until we pulled out to a bivouac area on the Mediterranean Sea near the wrecked town of Bizerte . Conditions were poor . The food was awful . And when I hear men complain-ing about conditions now  --  shows , leaves well it was plenty worse then . The Army was still new at the game . And then we had our special gripe . It is bad enough to live bad . It is plenty bad enough to know the odds in the game and to see those odds getting men you liked and buddied with and fought with . It is bad enough to know the weather and the land and the enemy are against you ; but the worst thing in it all is to feel " them " tearing at your self-respect . We hate " them " worst of anything , because it makes us wonder if we are men or just exactly what we are . " They " are our own countrymen , " comrades , " and all of us are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perilous effort to conquer an enemy that is our enemy and " their " enemy . Yet in most of the days spent in the military machine , once you have known the independence that battle reasserts in you  --  independence which " ( hey " in training have tried hour after hour to knock out of you  --  you hate " their " continued efforts to keep you down more than you hate the enemy 's attempts to kill you . ' There is a difference I have not made clear . You know the enemy is against you . You will try to kill him , he will try to kill you . It is not hate of him so much ; it is dread . What hate there is is not actually a permanent living thing at all . We had a commander , Handlebar Henry we called him , who was about as bad as " they " come on the morale of the enlisted men . As an example : one day we had a formal inspection . Each man had to show three field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the command Open Ranks March was given . If a man did n't have three it meant extra details . One man , McMahon , who was killed later at the Volturno River , did n't have any , but we found three empty boxes , filled them with sand , closed them up  --  and he passed inspection . About the chocolate itself  --  whoever made it should have eaten some of it . That sort of thing , a chicken-stuffed parade or regulation , keeps making us sick . I do n't think we 'll ever be rid of it . Pr HE day the replacements came into our bivouac area we had an all-day hike . When we returned to camp , dirty and down , we found the rookies waiting for us . After we were settled Captain Briacti , a tough Italian but fair to the men , brought over a second lieutenant who looked about twenty and as if he had n't had his first woman yet , dressed in officers ' O , D. 's and with a look of disappointment on his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old geezer with dried red hair and a wrinkled face and bad teeth . We were sitting together . Briacti said , " Fellas , here 's your new platoon leader , Lieutenant Parmetto . And here 's a new man for you . What did you say your name was , soldier ? " The man looked at him and spat out of the side of his mouth . " Did n't I tell ya , Cap'n ? " he said . " Slipped my mind . " " Well , it 's Locke . T. J. Locke . " The lieutenant looked at him and he looked at the lieutenant . That was the first time they had taken much notice of each other . Briacti introduced the noncoms , while we sat around and stared at him . The lieutenant had black hair and black eyes and a smooth complexion . He was well built . He spoke with a bounce , and / liked his smile . Locke went into the puptent assigned to him . His hair was reddish brown but there was some gray to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . He stooped slightly , but he kept his head up when he walked . He looked as if he did n't care about any of us . I noticed that he had one cauliflower ear , and a broken red nose . You ca n't tell much about a man in a combat outfit until you get him into combat ; not defensive warfare , but attack , where you must push the enemy and get along on as little as possible . Parmetto was n't too bad while we stayed in Africa taking training . He was G.I. , but you ca n't expect a man who has been through the discipline and baloney of officer camps in the United States to use common sense when he gets on his own in garrison , in the States or overseas . As for Locke , it did n't take us long to find out his chief characteristic . He drank , and like no one else I have ever seen . Where hundreds and thousands of others had gone by , searching and finding nothing , Locke would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for a short while , and lo , the wines flowed forth . It seemed simple , but others who tried it failed . He was a much envied man . He was not a good soldier for training areas . He would not obey . He simply did n't go for what was dished out . It was not that he was out-and-out rebellious ; when he received a direct order he obeyed . But he just did n't attempt to cotton to all the regulations that were put out and that threatened us everywhere we went . The lieutenant did n't like him , but he could n't put a finger on him . Locke always did his job . Besides , we were all independent . He was simply more independent than we were . We had no trouble with him ; he shared his liquor and his women with us . If we , by ourselves , could n't find what we wanted we would ask him . If he could n't get it , no one could . By the time we left for Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military police in Bizerte and Ferryville , which was the old French military center in the Bizerte area . PTHE . Italian campaign was a tiresome one . All the way it was slow . Even at its fastest we were following up a retreat , not putting the enemy on a run . The terrain , limiting maneuver , was greatly responsible . But we had to fight facts , not reasons . In battle a man in authority can take out any vengeance he desires . Old types of torture do n't compare . I remember when I was in a line company in Africa a man getting sent out on three straight patrols until he was killed simply because he was on the outs with his sergeant , and when the report came in on his death the sergeant only laughed . In garrison , punishment can be a detail , and extra labor ; in battle if you have bucked against a superior you can be sent on this mission or that , and you have no legal complaint . It is your job and you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Locke never toadied . He never let himself do anything that could be considered that . Perhaps his mistake was in showing Parmetto outright that to him Parmetto was just a second looie and no more . That occurred north of Naples . We had to find a place one night to shovel approaches to a stream in our sector , so that our vehicles could ford . The lieutenant decided to have us work at a certain spot . " I think we 'll put it here , " he said . " Put it there , hell , " Locke said . " A peep ' 11 get stuck there sure as hell . " " What makes you think so ? " Sergeant Blanton said . " A jackass can see it , " Locke said . He walked into the stream , just like that . Blanton shouted , " Hey ! " but Parmetto told him to keep it quiet . The place was under observation in the daytime still and nobody knew exactly how far sound would go there at night . ? " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's up to my waist . " He walked downstream about ten yards to where the water stopped at boot level . Without saying anything he walked from one bank to the other and came back to us . " Well , " he said , " there 's a good place to work if you want it . It 's got a good bottom to it too . " The sergeant told the fellows to start digging there . Except for his command there was nothing else said . Locke watched , with his hands on his hips . I heard him say to Blanton , " I 'm going back to the house to get my clothes off . " " Okay , " Blanton said . The lieutenant said nothing , absolutely nothing , until we had the job done . We could tell from the way the air felt that he was boiling mad . But he was wrong to begin with . He walked back and he did n't say a thing . They still got along after that , being polite face to face  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joe . He was better than some of the officers we have had before and since . He would go out on a job with us every once in a while and he took care of his book work well enough . Except for the way he needled Locke he pretty much let Blanton run the platoon the way Blanton wanted to . He was a nice kid , good-looking , sort of a regular guy . Of course the noncoms beefed about doing his field work for him and every once in a while we would get roped in on something that was n't our job at all because he wanted to make a good impression , but you ca n't expect perfection from a man just because he is an officer . But after a while you can tell it . You can tell from the way an officer walks and looks with his other officers what kind he is . If you get your staff together , and everybody is tightened up , as if a shell was coming in to wipe the works clean , then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not worth much . If everybody is easy but one man , that man 's the one to watch . In a lieutenant it means he 's trying to buck . Tightness does not have to be actually tight to be recognized . A man can put on an act and he will overreach himself . He knows it and so does everyone else . Whenever Parmetto was with the company commander or the staff he worried himself into formality when no one else was being formal . As I say , he was clever enough to catch on . The tightness became familiarity , the sure-you-know-meAl attitude . Close to , he seemed to fit himself to the lieutenants and the company RANK 243 commander , too , Away from him , you only had to look at Parmetto standing stiffly trying to slouch to guess at the grand strategy . He was likeable and he could toss a joke , or what passes for a joke with us , any time , but it did n't fool us . We were old-timers , so we knew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we expected Locke to lose his head over one thing or another . Our sergeant-major , Jameson , was about thirty-seven years old , and he liked his liquor and wine . Whenever Locke had some , Locke was an old pal and buddy to him , but when Jameson was sober he spent more time trying to get a court martial on Locke than anyone else . By December fifteenth when we jumped off for Cassino , Locke had had five charges against him , but none of them had gone to court . He could be cussed out back and forth : it did n't bother him . When we were on the line he did his work . Work ? Why , he was given more chances to die than anybody else in our platoon . If there was a bad minefield , Locke was in on cleaning it . Three boys in one squad were killed working with him , but he never had a scratch . The funny thing was , he knew that Parmetto was picking him for this job or that . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it was routine , and the bets were that nothing could happen , Locke was doing something else . All he would ever say on the subject unless he was drunk was , " To hell with him , to hell with everybody . " Where the rest of us would be scared stiff of mines we knew nothing about , Locke would laugh and go out . He had two Silver Stars by the first of the year and God knows he deserved them both . I never did hear anyone , even Jameson in his cups , accuse him of leaving a job until it was done , and done right . But when the job was done , presto , he was hopeless as far as the Army was concerned . None of us could blame him . We did n't have the nerve to do the kind of work he was doing , and though we envied him we did n't have the guts to behave the way he did . He was the freest man over here . I N EVERY combat group there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a platoon , or hail a company is lost . There are deaths and rapid promotions . Compared to the line companies , headquarters of an infantry battalion is almost a stable group but even in it  --  well , right now there are fifteen of us left of the company I joined in Africa . Christmas day the commanding general of the division  --  a man we common soldiers did n't like because he did n't like us  --  pinned a silver bar on Parmetto 's shoulder strap which meant he had his first lieutenancy , more money , a better looking signature , and we ourselves hoped it would mean that this was as far as he would try to go . What went on at Cassino after I was flit I do n't know firsthand . From what the boys say , old Locke did himself up brown . He went out every night past our lines by himself , once our positions were stabilized for a period , and he would set up a road block . Every morning before dawn he would go out again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ditch , where jerry could n't see them . Fifteen days he did that , and he never asked for a relief . A couple of days before we were going to pull out Lieutenant Parmetto called him up . " How are things going ? " he asked . " Good enough . Fine , " Locke said . " Well , I think I 'll send up a couple of men tonight to relieve you . " " Tonight ? Ha , I do n't need ' em . I 'll stay here till we get out . " He hung up the phone . Locke told the story over and over again when he was drunk , of how the lieutenant wanted to send two men to relieve him just two days before the whole regiment went off the line . He always asked in conclusion , " Now was n't that generous ? " When I came back into the outfit at Anzio , Locke was still going strong . He had had only two summary courts , which had cost him about $30 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . I think he knew what the score would be when Lieutenant Parmetto as the oldest officer in the company took over command . Locke tried a half-hearted reform , but the appeal of the alcohol we could get from the rear echelon stills for $5 a quart was too strong for him . He kept talking back to Parmetto and one day when Parmetto , suddenly angry , told him , " I 'll get you , Locke , if you do n't start to behave right , " Locke just laughed at him . I was near them , and I saw the look on Parmetto 's face . I was glad I was a bystander and not in Locke 's shoes . The old boy took all the details on the chin  --  extra kitchen police , extra guard , extra sump holes . " They , " quoting Army regulations , will tell you that such dealings ca n't be done in the Army without a form of trial , but " they " have n't seen the case from the bottom side . Anything goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked a good many miles past Rome two significant events occurred in our outfit . One , Lieutenant Parmetto was made a captain . Two , his first real action once he had his two bars was to send Locke to Love Company with the informal explanation to Locke that the captain of Love had requested him for a vacant position as first scout in his first platoon , because he liked his work so much . That did n't fool anyone ; I do n't know if the captain intended it to , or if he thought it would . Perhaps Parmetto expected Locke to break down and come crying to him ; the rest of us , even though we were on his side , expected and looked forward to seeing our strong man go weak ; but Locke just laughed in everybody 's face and spoke out as he had n't spoken in a long time . He told Parmetto when he saw him , " I see you 're getting rid of me , Lieutenant . I mean Captain , " he said . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " The hell he did . Well , when I kill my first Jerry think of you . " It should have been a great day for Parmetto . He was king of the world , his own small one , and he was rid of his own particular nuisance . Yet he went around with a sour face all day . Even the first sergeant could n't get close to him . What doubts we might have had about Locke , old and alcoholic , getting along in a rifle company we quickly lost . The first MAGAZINE day in the platoon he talked to the lieutenant , found out he did n't drink , and bought his officer 's whisky ration from him for three dollars . We did n't believe it until he showed us the bottle . When we entered the fall campaign attacking the Gothic Line Locke became a regimental legend . If you mentioned his name to anyone there was almost always the same remark : " Have you heard what he did the other day ? " There simply was never anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Locke had absolutely no fear . Where no one else walked , he walked ; where no one else talked , he talked ; where no one else smoked , he lit a cigarette . What made the difference , he always got away with it . He had a glorious life attacking the Gothic Line . One night , with two men to give him fire support if necessary , he went up to cut a barbed-wire entanglement across the path going up a hill to the Jerry dugouts . He did it , and removed half a dozen mines along with it . " I know as much about mines as anybody here , " he once told some engineers who were giving us classes . I think he did . He removed more mines when he was with us than the rest of the platoon did . He would do anything . There was the night he held a summit by himself . He kept about six weapons with him . Must of the company had gone off the hill , for the mortar fire had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed . Locke dispersed them about the hill while he watched the top . The fire continued heavy , but every hour or two the men that were left saw Locke . He brought them more ammo , or a gun , or some rations he had found in the dark . The enemy tried a counterattack in company strength about three o'clock in the morning . Locke and his squad beat them back . It is not done by many soldiers today , moving around rashly under fire , but Locke did it . He was all over the hill , and he kept the Germans from rewinning it . One of the boys who was up there told me that there was one kraut on the hill the next morning whom they found with a cut throat and a bashed head . None of them in the squad had done it . Locke , when asked about it , said that the German had just come too close for his health . Locke was n't recommended for a medal . I would n't have known why if Ohmer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after he received notification he was going home after two years overseas . We were in regimental reserve , Ohmer fell into our pyramidal tent waving a bottle . " Have a drink , " he said . I smelled it . It was rotgut gasoline cognac , the kind we ran into first in Naples . " You 're almost as drunk as Locke used to get , " Lastus , our new tech sergeant , said . Ohmer shook his head and his voice cried with liquor . He squinted at us , and put his linger on his lips . " Can you guys hold a secret ? " he said . " Sure , " we said . Maybe he knew something , a new rumor , division relief perhaps . " Well , " he cried , " You know why Locke did n't get a medal for back there , back on the hill , when  --  when . " " Yeln " Lastus said . " I know when . " " That Parmetto bastard tore it up . You do n't believe mc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He took another drink . " I saw it . I saw it and gave it to him and he looked at it and he said you know what he said I bet you do n't know . " " Naw , what ? " Lastus said . " He said ? " Ohmer stopped . every time he drank he was that way . I think a good part of his drunk was wishing to get drunk , and the first whiff of alcohol put him close to the line , while the second sent him over . " What in the hell did he say ? " said Lastus . " He  --  he tore the paper up into little pieces , into tiny squincy pieces , and he put ' em on the floor and he lit a match to ' em and he watched them burn and he puffed it out like that , poof ! He looked at us and we laughed too . " Just that way , poof . And he looked at me and he blew air out of his mouth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And nobody put it in again . " When he told us that , I felt as if we were trying to stretch an arm out of shape , trying to pull it out of the room and through the outside , trying to meet Locke , just to say hello , maybe to ask him to have a drink . Just to say hello , old-timer , we 're all for you . Hopeless wishing . L CKE 'S company came up on the hill in the morning  --  all of it ; a platoon of it , with the officers and noncoms that were left . The next night the Germans tried another attack , but they did n't push the men off . The company stayed there while Item Company went through them and took the next hill . By the next nightfall that hill was ours , and we had broken the Gothic Line . Love Company then went through Item , through the defenses the Germans had left . After that bitter fighting it was like a dream to be able to advance without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire belt and walk erect , knowing there would be no small-arms shooting . The company had to cross the wire belt that ran around the hill to get down to the road . The next fight would be several miles ahead , where the terrain for attack went uphill again . Locke cut the wire . " Any mines there ? " his lieutenant asked . " Nah , " he said , " there 's just this one over to the side of where I cut . It 's a big thing . " " Weil , mark it with something and let 's go , " the lieutenant said . Locke was on his hands and knees feeling around the mine . " Just mark it , Locke , " the lieutenant said . " Hell , somebody might step on it yet , " Locke said . " Just mark it then . " " You think I 'm afraid of it ? " " No . No use looking for trouble , though . " " I can disarm it . I know about these mines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sticks around It could happen to anybody else  --  you , me , anybody , but not Locke . The company medic gave him first aid , which did n't mean very much . He saw to it that he took his sulfa pills , and he put a bandage on his arm . He took his bandages and tried to fix his chest . The radio man called battalion and asked for a stretcher and bearers . The company had stopped . Locke was unconscious . The medic stayed with him , and the company went on . In about half an hour Locke was on a stretcher , and it was another hour before lie was in the medic aid station . 7 was in the room they carried him through , which was then the battalion rear command post . He was conscious by that time . " How you doin ' ? " I asked . " Doin ' , hell , " he said . " I 'm here , ai n't I ? " The technician fourth-grade in the medics came out later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , a hole in his chest , and his right foot badly shattered . Parmetto heard that and said , " Hm . That 's too bad . He was a good man , was n't he ? " He stood up and stretched himself , and yawned . " I think I 'll go in and see him , cheer him up , " be said , to no one in particular . He opened the door to the medics . I saw Locke on a stretcher , his head upon a pillow , looking toward us . Parmetto said , " Hello , Locke . " Locke looked at him and said quietly , but it was quieter in the room now and we could hear him , " You filthy bastard . Well , are you satisfied now ? You got what you wanted . You ought to be happy now . Take a good look , you filthy bastard . " He turned his head away once more . Parmetto closed the door and turned around . We were all staring at him . He saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That sonofa ? " But when he saw nobody else laughing with him , all of us looking at him as if perhaps he were hurt , the laugh died out of his voice like a falling wind and his voice died down . " Well , " he said , and straightened out his collar . He went outside . I would n't have been in his shoes the rest of that day for all the money in the world . I 'd rather be what I am , a do-nothing nobody , than take the looks of the people he was with . It was worse than being hit , I think , and it got Parmetto . MITERE was n't much to it after that . Parmetto tightened up ; he would n't speak to anyone unless it was on business , and none of us spoke to him unless we had to . When our new battalion commander came in he shoved Parmetto up to regiment in his first week . Parmetto was one of those extra officers a regiment always seems to carry . We heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking , but the people who told us never said that he should stop or anything . Everyone guessed he would get into trouble . So far today I have come across no one who feels bad about Parmetto 's accident unless , as it was with us , it reminds us of Locke . Locke was a queer man , but he was one of us . Already announcement has come down that there is going to be a memorial parade and formation for Parmetto tomorrow . We will be special honor guard , and the regimental commander will make a speech honoring him and , I hear , the others who fell in our last campaign . I just wonder what he will say .
