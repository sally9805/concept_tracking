 | Now I Am For the Churches Condensed from The American Mercury Roger William Riis Six MONTHS AGO I scoffed at the churches . Then one day , on a sudden whim , I attended a service . Since then I have been going steadily , first out of curiosity to see what the much-attacked churches are up to , lately out of rising excitement . I have not " got religion " ; I always had that . But I have found out that churches today are dispensing something I need , and that church and religion go together . One Sunday last May the newspaper offered me this : " Rotterdam is ablaze . Shooting is heard in every street . " That was the morning I happened into a church , for the first time in 22 years . And what did the church offer me ? A simple , reverent service , featured by a sermon on " Peter , The Rock , " on the permanence and beauty of the church . I found that I was acutely interested in hearing about anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell on my spirit like water on a desert , and I went out stirred and grateful . A week later I took my curiosity to another church and heard the minister , in a singularly lovely  | building , talk simply and beautifully on " The Ascending Life . " Without a trace of sanctimonious heroics , he conversed informally about the insistent demand of life to rise , to grow , to improve itself . It was adult , it was spiritual ; and to me , personally , it was helpful . Since then , as business and vacation travel took me about the country , I have made it a point to attend and study churches ? all kinds . I have tried to discover what makes the leading churches vital in their communities . And I state with assurance that the critics of the churches today do n't know what they are talking about . True , a minority of churches still offer a dull , repellent form of salvation , some in ugly buildings , some with painful music , some with humdrum ministers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor need you condemn all churches because some fail . It is obvious that the assailants of churches do not go to church . They do n't know what the churches are doing these days . I suspect the critics rationalize what is really laziness into a superior intellectual attitude . At any rate , that is what I used to do . Now I am for the churches because they have something for me , and something for civilization . Dr. Ernest Fremont Tittle , of Evanston , Ill. , one of the clearest voices I have heard , says : " Let God be thanked there is on earth an institution that has a high opinion of man , declaring that he is in some sense a son of God who has within himself divine possibilities ; an institution that transcends race , nation and class ; an institution which is loyally undertaking to embody the spirit of Christ , and in his name to relieve human suffering , promote human welfare and carry on a ministry of reconciliation among men . " I find myself unable any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd rather go into the woods and worship alone . Many of the clergy are dull men , concerned over trivial taboos . Anyway , Sunday is my day for loafing . " Time and again , I have found in church something which lifted my spirit . That , I now believe , was what I unconsciously sought . The churches ' varied social activities mean nothing to me . But if countless others find social outlets in churches , so much the better . They get what they seek ; so do I , New York 's beautiful Church of the Ascension has great wooden doors which open outward , but they are carved on the inside because they are never closed . Every year over 30,000 persons slip in at odd hours for a moment of quiet meditation . They get what they seek . The remote hamlet of Jonesville Va. , has been holding an annual  | four-day prayer meeting for over a century . The day I was there 2000 people were in attendance . Men , women , children , earnest and devout . Revival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff . Good stuff . These people come from hundreds of miles around ; they get what they seek . The Dominican Sisters at Corpus Christi Church in New York conducted a " project " in tolerance in their church school . Not an attack on intolerance , but a positive , laboratory experiment in tolerance . This demonstration by Catholic , Jewish and Protestant children raised a wild flurry of hope in my heart ; if human beings can do this sort of thing , we 'll get this world fixed right yet ! When you go to church you should actively seek something . You must not go like an empty bucket , waiting passively to be filled . When you go to a movie , you take at least a sympathetic , hopeattitude . That 's the least you Id bring to a church . Sunday r Sunday , I have seen conger of 1000 and 1500 people , apparently getting whatever values they sought . Church attendance , by the way , is bigger than skeptics think , and is showing marked increases . Why is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ? clergyman themselves say the personality of the clergyman is the most important reason . Naturally , many churches do not rise above the level of their communities . Churches are human institutions , clergymen are human beings ; they are not all great spiritual leaders . But when they are ? and they are often ? they manage to make your relation with God an astonishingly practical , useful , alluring thing . While church architecture , furnishings , and the quality of church music attract or repel worshipers , the clergyman stands out as the most influential factor . Most sermons are surprisingly good ? and useful . Channing Pollock recently said that no one can deliver a " vital address " as often as a cleric must. * True , but why miss the many vital addresses he does deliver ? Mr. Pollock said that sermons are remote from world affairs . Yet half those I have heard interpreted world affairs from the Christian viewpoint . A third of them were concerned exclusively with Gospel teachings . Successful churches are those whose clergymen set forth uncompromising Christianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is the great asset of the church . The more vigorously a church proclaims it , the more people respect and follow that church . What I like most about going to church is that it turns one 's attention , willy-nilly , to higher things  | for at least a little while each week . Man does not live by bread alone ; he requires some cultivation of the spirit . Even when I have wandered into a church where the minister was dull , the music bad , the interior ugly , I have been compelled by my very presence there to think about things loftier than my daily affairs . That , I know , has been good for me . In a world haunted by violence , churches do their human best to represent the spirit . I am warmly grateful for that when I am in church . Significantly , the two nations which are officially anti-church are the nations of Communism and Nazism ; the nations where the churches flourish are the democracies , where the spirit of man is free . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totalitarian way until and unless the democracies somehow crusade under the banner of the church . How can we defeat the destructive dynamics of Nazism and Communism unless we employ the constructive dynamics of the spirit ? William Penn said , " Men must be governed by God or they will be ruled by tyrants . " The world today is his witness . " To love God , " says one minister , " is to believe , despite every appearance to the contrary , that slavery , war and crippling poverty can be banished from the earth , and that conditions favorable to the highest development of the human spirit can be created . " That is extraordinarily practical Christianity . In fact , I can not distinguish it from the democratic ideal in action . Believing that , I can no longer say that I would rather do my worshiping alone and that Sunday is my day for loafing . It is an exciting spiritual adventure , this going to church . Try it . Pay no attention to denomination . Just out of the curiosity you owe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost surely find , in every community , one church that will give you what you want , even if you ca n't put that into words . Whether or not we realize it , each of us has a personal spiritual quest . It is only ourselves we cheat if we ignore it . In this , of all ages , it is time we were about that quest . I find the churches a good place to pursue it . If they offered nothing but that , they should now be upheld by all men of intelligence and good will . Fifty reprints of this article will be supplied , without charge , to any clergy man requesting them .
