Royal Air Force bombers paid a visit to Nazi Rotterdam one dawn last week . Just to make sure Germany would have fuel trouble in mounting her invasion of Britain , they rebombed the oil storage tanks along the Maas , reported " a great explosion ... lit up the adjoining docks and waterways . Flames rose several hundred feet . ... It is believed they are now totally destroyed . " <P> But German words and acts last week and this week pointed to the heart of France , rather than Britain , as the Nazi juggernaut 's next immediate destination . High-flying waves of German bombers paraded over Paris , began a new reign of terror by showering heavy bombs at airfields , factories , railroads . Forty-five people were killed , 149 injured and thousands scared , including U. S. Ambassador Bullitt ( see p. 30 ) . Marseille and Lyon were raided by Germans looking for industrial objectives down the Rhone Valley . <P> The Allied Supreme War Council , meeting in Paris " more unalterably resolved than ever , " knew that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's new Somme-Aisne line from Abbeville to Montmedy ( see map ) . British regiments , first arrivals of a new B. E. F. , landed at Le Havre , were sent at once to this line . Attacks were launched at Abbeville and points east to recapture bridgeheads needed to stem the fresh assault which Fhrer Hitler &; Staff were observed preparing . Indicating their lively interest in those bridgeheads , the Germans counterattacked repeatedly . All French infantry divisions , all tanks and artillery that could be spared from France 's eastern border were massed and dug in below Amiens , Laon . Rethel . The brief breathing spell gained for Weygand by the northern Armies ' heroic stand was now over . <P> Hitler 's new attack , the Allies knew , would be no less terrific than his last . But this time there were probably 100,000 fewer trained German soldiers in the world , and perhaps three times as many wounded whose return through Germany to hospitals in Poland , Moravia and Austria aroused what the Allies believed were the German people 's first serious misgivings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had boomed , crashing down . <P> The Allies had learned things about Blitzkrieg and its accessories . It was reported , for example , that the turrets of the 70-ton German break-through tanks ( which Germany got by her seizure of the Skoda munitions works in Czechoslovakia ) are their vulnerable spot . The quality of German aircraft , the ability of German pilots ( many of whom are sent up with minimum flight instruments , obliged to follow-their-leader ) were not believed up to Allied par . Allies saw that inferior , half-trained troops were mixed in with the elite . For their own civilian Army ranks they now had a leavening of veterans returning from Dunkirk ( see p. 24 ) , whose three weeks in Flanders were as instructive as three years of World War I.
