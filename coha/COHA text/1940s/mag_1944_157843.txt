The world got the shock it had been waiting for . But to the U.S. the shock was cushioned by the dead of night ; the news came in the hours when the soberest of men are drunken with sleep . Perhaps never was such big news heard by so few . When the nation woke up , the great fact was hours old . <P> Over the quiet American cities and the somnolent farms a bombers ' moon shone through the cool June night . At 12:37 a.m . ( E.W.T. ) bells tinkled on the news tickers in newspaper and radio offices . FLASH : <P> GERMAN TRANS-OCEAN AGENCY CLAIMS ALLIED INVASION HAS BEGUN . Out Went the news over U.S. radio stations . Was this it ? <P> For three hours , Radio Berlin kept it up : paratroopers landed near the Seine estuary ; the harbor of Le Havre shelled ; Calais and Dunkirk raided by strong bomber formations . Every new flash brought the probability nearer . But most of the U.S. slept on . <P> " In Ten Seconds . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to speak . All four major networks stood by for London . Over the shortwave at last came the dry , deliberate voice of Colonel R. Ernest Dupuy , press aide to General Eisenhower : " This is Supreme Headquarters , Allied Expeditionary Force . The text of Communique No. 1 will be released to the press and radio of the United Nations in ten seconds . " <P> In measured tones , Colonel Dupuy counted up to ten . Then , reading slowly , he confirmed the news : the invasion had begun , on the northern coast of France . <P> For the next few hours , the great , pulse-beating job of telling the U.S. people of the greatest military undertaking in his tory belonged to the U.S. radio . The U.S. slept on , but the radio worked as if it had the biggest audience in history . First , from London , came the rolling , authoritative voice of General Eisenhower , reading his proclamation to the people of Western Europe ; then Norway 's King Haakon and Belgian Premier Hubert Pierlot . <P> Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account . NBC 's Wright Bryan , who had flown over the invasion coast with paratroopers , stepped to a London microphone , breathlessly told of the lack of German opposition . <P> In CBS 's Manhattan newsroom , Broadcaster Bob Trout roamed about with a portable microphone for seven hours , reading rapid-fire dispatches as they clacked in , letting his listeners hear the clack of the tickers , the excited shuffling of chairs . <P> Any Other Morning . As morning came and the realization finally dawned that this was Dday , the U.S. people reacted like Americans . <P> In early-morning Washington , a cab driver , parked near the White House , said : " It may be D-day but it looks just like any other morning to me . " Two days earlier the U.S. had received a false invasion flash from the Associated Press 's London office , sent by an inexperienced girl teletype operator . Now , in Redding , Calif. , a policeman echoed the sentiments of many citizens when he said : " That girl was n't far off , was she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her West Point hotel , Mrs. Dwight Eisenhower exclaimed : " The invasion ? What about the invasion ? Why has n't someone told me ? "
