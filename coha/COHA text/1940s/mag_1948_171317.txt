THOMAS WOLFE ( 196 pp. ) - Herbert J. Muller-New Directions ( $2 ) . <P> It has now been nearly ten years since Thomas Wolfe died , and in that decade his reputation with the critics has steadily declined , while his popularity with the public has increased . His admirers see Wolfe as a rock-solid , almost primitive spokesman of the American people , whose novels are a grandiose articulation of their own vague , subterranean but insistent attitudes towards the puzzles of human life , and whose writing absorbed the textures , aromas , frustrations , daydreams and tragedies of America with an amplitude unequaled by any writer since Whitman . <P> Dissenters grant Wolfe a large talent , but claim that his technical deficiencies prevented him from fully realizing his potentialities . Such critics are appalled by what they consider Wolfe 's undisciplined and often pointless verbosity , his naive egotism and his outrageous lack of organized knowledge about the modern world . Bernard De Voto summed up this view in four words : " Genius is not enough . " <P> In his cautious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike a balance between the two extremes . Probably Muller 's temperate judgment is close to the truth , but readers who feel strongly about Wolfe are likely to become impatient with his fence straddling . Wolfe is the sort of author who inspires lyricism or invective , not judicious interpretation . Muller is therefore up against it , and knows it . <P> Ludicrous &; Loving . Ready to grant most of the criticisms made of Wolfe , he admits that " no other important modern writer has appeared so often naive , extravagant , maudlin , ludicrous . " But the strength of Wolfe 's novels lies in their deep and loving evocation of significant segments of U.S. life ; Thomas Wolfe 's " image is the great national myth , the American Dream . " No one else has so vividly rendered the inner tensions of ordinary , unintellectual small-town Americans-and done so in the traditional rolling phrases of the American declamatory style which Wolfe inherited from Whitman and Melville . <P> But the most daring and presumptuous thing about Wolf was his ambition to pour all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All his novels are intensely autobiographical , self-centered as no other American writer has dared to be . And yet Wolfe claimed for them a universal relevance that no other American writer dared to claim . <P> Thunderbolt Language . His first novels Look Homeward , Angel and Of Time and the River , were overwhelming performances : in the face of their mass and virtuosity , what was the use of rebelling against his frequent abuse of the language that he handled as if he were God hurling thunderbolts ? <P> Then came Wolfe 's difficulties . As his thick flood of words rolled into his publishers ' offices , there to be diked and channeled , it became clear that Wolfe would never develop any controlling ideas that could give esthetic unity or moral significance to his work .
