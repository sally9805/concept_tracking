txt Interior Secretary Krug indicated yesterday that Congress will be asked soon to approve some kind of federal subsidy for oil and gasoline manufactured from coal and shale . Ten years from now . Mr. Krug bi.lieves. the United States should have an industry capable of extracting about 2 million barrels of liquid fuels daily from coal and shale . He estimates these facilities would cost $9 billion and would require about 16 million tons of steel . As a first step . three plants would be built to use three different processes . At present . petroleum output in the United States is at an average rate of 5 323.437 barrels daily . Testifying yesterday before the House Public Lands Committee . Mr. Krug said he believes these three plants " should be built and Operated by private industry .
