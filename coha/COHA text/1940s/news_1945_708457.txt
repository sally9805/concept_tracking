txt BROOKLYN OFFICER FIRST AT THE RHINE Leads Platoon From Captured Neuss , Which Is Bedecked With Surrender Flags By SYDNEY GRUSON 17Iv Wireles to THE Nzw YORK TIMES . NEUSS , on the Rhine , March 2 ? Bedecked with white flags , Neuss was captured today and American troops had gained the Rhine River , the last natural barrier to the heart of Germany just . one week after the opening of the Ninth Army 's offensive . The honor of taking Neuss and reaching the Rhine went to the Eighty-third Infantry Division . A patrol commanded by Lieut . Robert Packer of 1240 East Twentyeighth Street of Brooklyn got to the ' river 's edge shortly after midnight through the dock area on the eastern outskirts , even before the city had been secured . There was a brief fight for // Neuss , no longer a prosperous industrial town but a battered hulk from bombing by the Allies ' air forces and artillery fire by the Ninth Army . Five dug-in 20-mm. guns caused some trouble until rooted out by artillery and tanks operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battalion captured the city and the job of flushing out the remaining German soldiers was still going on when this correspondent reached there with Wes Gallagher of The Associated Press , Gordon Cammack of The Des Moines Register and Tribune and Victor Jones of The Boston Globe . We had traveled yesterday with the fast-moving Second Armored Division , which was cutting through German resistance to the north and branched off this morning to get to the Rhine . From the top of a six-story school building by the docks we looked over the Rhine to Duesseldorf on the east bank and watched artillery shells and bombs from our fighter bombers bursting in that industrial center . Piper Cub spotting planes circled lazily overhead , disregarding light ack ack from German guns in Duesseldorf . " Do n't get your face too close to the window , " Lieutenant Packer said as a reminder that the house from where we watched was under German observation . We walked a mile to the last building in Neuss before the river with six soldiers armed with automatic rifles and Sgt. Harry Perrigo of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr . of Austin , Tex. , to guard us . Fight Gone From Germans Lieutenant Packer joined the group en route . He deployed soldiers on both sides of the street as we neared the school building . The street on which it stood had not been gone over for Germans and around the corner as we passed two doughboys had just found another batch of Germans hiding in the buildings . But there was no fight left in the Germans  --  soldiers or civilians ? still in Neuss . A German woman came running over with a key to the building as a soldier began to hammer down the door . They had been showing similar cooperation all morning , offering to take soldiers to billets but getting little response from the Americans . Lieutenant Packer , 23 years old , who joined the Army after he finished his studies at Lafayette University , said , " We just walked into the town and met a couple of stray shots . I guess Jerry was trying to find out whether we were coming or not but anyway we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . " There was more to it than Lieutenant Packer had said , however . Capt . Charles W. Schmitt of 10 Glover Avenue , Yonkers , N. Y. , battalion operations officer , and Capt . Leo McCarthy of Baltimore , Md. , filled in some of the details . Dug-in German guns pinned down the first troops into the city , inflicting some casualties before they were destroyed by Captain McCarthy 's tanks and artillery fire , directed by Capt . Donald Dey of 312 Christie Heights , Leonia , N. J. , artillery liaison officer . Germans Obey U. S. Order The Germans obviously were taken by surprise , for when Capt . Thomas H. Broadfoot of Bradford , R. I. , led his company into the city in darkness they met Germans marching down the street in a column of fours . Captain Broadfoot 's company lined up on both sides of the street and when the Germans were far enough advanced between the lines of American soldiers , the shouted order to " Halt ! Put up your hands ! " brought rifles clattering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One American private walked into Neuss armed only with a pistol and ran smack into a German half track with an 88mm gun and fifteen men . All fifteen surrendered to the private and gave up the gun intact . The number of prisoners taken in Neuss had mounted to about 250 , including some twenty officers , by 10 o'clock this morning but it promised to go a lot higher as the house-to-house search continued . All the way up to the Rhine American doughboys joked about what they are going to do when they reached it . Everybody in the whole Ninth Army was eager to get to the river first and competition among these men of the Eighty-third Infantry Division really grew intense . Our opposition today did not stiffen until nightfall . Few German tanks were sighted and some were knocked out , one by an antitank gun , which went down the wrong road and turned around just in time to see a Mark IV crossing the road . The gunner poured five shells into it swiftly and , as he put it , the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The weather broke today . Rain fell this afternoon after a brilliantly clear morning when Mustangs and Thunderbolts gave road cover and close support . The planes smashed one road block of antitank guns before the weather closed in . White Flags Dot Area We captured town after town today , so swiftly that they hardly bore the marks of battle in vast contrast to Juelich , Titz , Jackerath and scores of other places that were bombed and shelled to bits early in the offensive . The towns we are taking now also have all their civilian population except for young men . For the most part the Germans ' faces are expressionless , but now and then one smiles or nods at the passing soldiers . There is no waving or smiling back . In one place a young boy gaev the Hitler salute ; in greeting and kept his arm up 1 until an old mart came along and slapped it down . The prisoners are a poor lot , mostly members of the Volkssturm . who come out of the ditches in front of almost every town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of about ten Frenchmen , still wearing their poilu hats , were released from one town today . They came down the road shouting , " Francaise ! Francaise ! Bon homme ! Bon jour ! " A lot of Polish slave laborers were also released .
