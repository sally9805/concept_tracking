Infra-red rays are hard to observe ; their waves are too long to be seen as light and too short to be heard in radio receivers . But they can be measured as heat on a bolometer-a machine with metal strips whose electrical conductivity is altered by heat rays falling on them . <P> Last fortnight Dr. Donald H. Andrews of Johns Hopkins University described a bolometer to top them all . Its sensitive surface is columbium nitride cooled by liquid hydrogen to minus 432 F. At this temperature-close to absolute zero-columbium nitride becomes " superconductive " ; its electrical resistance almost vanishes . When a heat ray hits it and warms it only one millionth of a degree , it gives a clear electrical signal . <P> This " superconductive bolometer " can register heat from a man 's body 500 yards away in total darkness . If hitched to a proper scanning device , it makes a rough picture of any warm object . Dr. Andrews , who had himself " photographed " by the bolometer ( see cut ) , thinks it will be useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has a future in medicine and astronomy . It might also have war possibilities , such as guiding an atom-armed rocket toward the warmth of a blacked-out city .
