If there is such a thing as a great letter-to-the-editor writer , New York City Park Commissioner Robert Moses is it . His work may not rank with Voltaire 's , Ben Franklin 's or George Bernard Shaw 's , but it commands attention . For or against , he is always long and strong . <P> Last week he outdid himself with a full-page swipe at ( and in ) the pro-Roosevelt New York Times . The Republican National Committee paid the Times $2,760 to run it as a political ad . <P> The burrs that caused Writer Moses to rise in the saddle were two Times editorials : 1 ) endorsing Term IV ; 2 ) declaring flatly for the President 's plan to delegate postwar power to use U.S. armed forces without recourse to Congress . The Times 's domestic arguments for Term IV Moses called " contradictory and unconvincing . " The international argument , on which the Times based its qualified Roosevelt endorsement , he dismissed as " drivel . . . claptrap of the cheapest sort . " <P> But on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came down hard . Force can not take the place of patience , persuasion , and cooperation , he insisted ; our armed forces will never willingly spend the next 20 years as pawns in an international army ; Congress will never back such a fantastic scheme to take away its power to order out troops . <P> Sandwiched in with his booming points was many a Moses pot shot : <P> " The President thought that if he were elected he could say that the people at a solemn referendum had voted him a blank cheque to control our world relations without Congress . . . . Does the Times really think that an affirmative two-thirds vote of the United States Senate could be obtained for this fantastic scheme ? " <P> " Mr. Jesse Jones , the Texas banker with the gimlet eye , and Miss Perkins , who has no more contact with realities than the wraith of an ectoplasm . . . . " <P> " Our subtle and plausible President , who delights in casting off men and measures which are no longer serviceable to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atlantic Charter which manifestly are as dead and unpleasant as last week 's herring . . . . " <P> " Up in his ivory tower , the editor of the Times will at last realize that the American people will not be bulldozed , regimented and stripped of their suffrage by fine phrases , chop logic , invitations to the millennium , and the jaded ambitions of indispensable men . " <P> In a small , mild editorial in the same issue , the Times observed : " Mr. Moses is always welcome , and we are used to having him call us names whenever he runs out of arguments . This is an experience which we share with practically everybody east of the Hudson River . "
