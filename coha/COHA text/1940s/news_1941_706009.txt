txt Until official details are available , judgment on the new Treasury tax proposal must be tentative . But , on the basis of the general outlines agreed upon in all reports , it is apparent that the suggestions laid before the House Ways and Means Committee by Secretary Morgenthau are drastic . The total of new taxes sought will come close to $5,000,000,000 , exceeding even the record-breaking $3,500,000,000 of the most recent tax law . The proposals as reported call for a supertax of 15 per cent on all incomes , after personal exemptions , to-be deducted at the source . Presumably this tax would apply not merely to wages and salaries , but - also to dividends , interest and other income payments . A similar tax would be imposed upon self-employed persons , such as doctors , lawyers and farmers . In addition , social security taxes are to be increased so that salary and wage earners will have an additional 3 per cent deducted from the first $3,000 of their pay . Prom the standpoint of general principles the deduction of income taxes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . Thb basic problem of defense taxation is to siphon off from the stream of national income a large part of the increased purchasing power flowing out of defense spending . It is highly desirable that this withdrawal of purchasing power take place simultaneously with the pumping out of new purchasing power through Government spending , rather than to permit the increased national income to work its way with prices for a year or more and then suddenly to confront the unwary taxpayer with a staggering tax on income he has already spent . The proposal to increase social security taxes is in another class . These taxes should be considered wholly apart from the defense program . The social security program is a permanent program . Taxes levied under it must be of a character that can be sustained without damage to the economy in hard times as well as during a defense boom . Defense tsixes , on the contrary , should be emergency in character , intended to meet the extraordinary demands of rearmament , but to be rapidly reduced or eliminated once the emergency is past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be apparent that , however heavy taxes must ultimately be made , there is a limit to the amount of increase that can be made overnight without working extreme hardship . On the basis of the rates reported to have been suggested by the Treasury , a married man earning $3,000 a year would have $315 of new taxes deducted from his pay envelope next year . On top of this he will have to pay a tax of $138 on his 1941 income . This makes a total of $453 , or 15 per cent of his gross income , contrasted with $30 , or 1 per cent , which was the amount of his income tax this year . It is necessary to put the brakes on inflation ; but there is such a thing as jamming on the brakes so hard that the passengers go through the windshield.
