Upset Explained <P> Sirs : <P> As a Nebraskan who voted a straight Republican ticket yesterday , I want to say that George W. Norris ' record was not " repudiated " by us . That was n't the issue at all . <P> I have relatives at the front in this war . I want them backed up and " generaled " a whole lot better than the present regime has done . So for Senator I wanted a young man who would jab the coals , shake the grate , open the draught and get the fires of action to roaring in this war . Mr. Norris , over 80 and always talking about retiring , did n't seem to be that man . We are proud of his record , but this is a new fight . <P> ELIZABETH LYMAN Omaha <P> " No Wounded Were Left . . . " <P> Sirs : <P> In your account of the sinking of the Wasp ( TIME , Nov. 2 ) you report that one of our returning pilots said , " I thought I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flight deck , but they may have been wounded left there or dead men . " <P> For the sake of the families of Wasp men reported missing , please allow me to say no wounded were left . Captain Sherman was the last man to leave the flight deck and shortly thereafter he came to the fantail of the ship where some of us remained . We were then evacuating the last of the wounded from the hangar deck areas . None of us will ever forget the courageous and unselfish conduct of our shipmates in caring for the wounded , both on the ship and in the water . The quotation is misleading . When the last of us left the ship , the wounded had already been evacuated . <P> LIEUT . MERRITT F. WILLIAMS Chaplain U.S.S. Wasp Washington <P> Best Christmas Gift <P> Sirs : <P> The greatest Christmas present that can be given to us this year is not smoking jackets , ties , pipes , or games . If people will only take the money used for such articles and buy war bonds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They will be helping themselves , and helping us to be home next Christmas . Being home next Christmas is something which would be appreciated by all of us boys in service ! <P> SERGEANT JOHN BRIDWELL <P> Glider Replacement Center Albuquerque <P> Post-War Plan <P> Sirs : <P> The following is from my son 's last letter : " These Negro boys I have under me are really a swell lot , hardworking , good-natured , and thoroughly cooperative . I was worried at first as to how they might respond , but am sincerely satisfied that I am getting good results .
