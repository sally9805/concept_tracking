 | This is the land I love . Much of it I have not seen , and much of it that I have seen looks as if it were made up of material God discarded when He was fashioning the suns and moons and stars and other bodies that share the heavens with our little planet : bleak , bare , worthless piles of stone ; sandy wastes of desert ; hummock and swampland that are the home of the rattlesnake , the moccasin , and the alligator . But beautiful nevertheless ; sometime in every day , beautiful beyond dreaming . Then we know that God planned it that way ? that the souls of men could look up to the hills and gather strength in the contemplation of things that can not be moved ; that the hearts and minds of men could be delighted by the sheer majesty of deserts , the shimmering beauty of wasteland and swamp . The things that are not beautiful are not God 's handiwork , but man 's : bare , dead , eroded fields ; pitiful remnants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; habitations of man himself that deny the contention that there is beauty in his soul ? hovels in which men exist like animals . But it is my land , and I love it . Not one inch of it will I yield to anyone , though he come blustering with mighty ships and planes and hosts of armed men and try to take it from me ? not unless and until a crimson tide engulfs it and there is no more blood to shed . Here I was born free ; here will I live free or die . Death is the victory if freedom must go . But do n't think I love my land so blindly as not to see its faults ; a sense of shame must accompany any reading of its true history , any honest appraisal of conditions that exist today . I mean that there are spots in its history , past and in the making , that are very , very dark , though the fabric as a whole is so bright and so supremely fair , as such things go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect . For instance : I wish that when I am condemning brutal landgrabs from weaker peoples , I did not have to remember that my country is not quite guiltless ? no , not quite , no matter how inferior it thinks the original Americans were . If the things she has done had all been done in the long ago , I could offer an excuse : but some of them I myself remember . I wish that when atrocities committed against racial minorities are listed to the shame of a mighty nation , I did not have to pretend not to hear when asked about thousands of Americans of another color that have been lynched ? some only last year . I wish that when the picture of the world 's poverty-stricken areas is spread before me , I could look at it clear-eyed , not having to forget America 's city slums , her Southern mountains , her Mexican quarters . I wish that this were wholly " the land of the free , the home of the brave . " That everyone here believed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every habitation in every corner of the land were the home of a happy , economically independent family . That there were not now , and never would be , in all America , any really poor ? poor with the poverty that grinds and sears and blinds to the beauty and the hope and the glory of this land of mine . For , after all that can be said against it has been said , it still is both a land of beauty and a " land of hope and glory . " I would not trade it for all the rest of the world ? not its fields and forests , mountains and deserts and plains , cities and little towns and snugly safe farm homes , rivers and lakes and little streams ; not its institutions for worship and for learning , to which everyone can go for that which no one is denied ; not its amazing industries , spreading an ownership of creature comforts that are the wonder of the world ; not its freedom . Above all , not its freedom , from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have and my determination to keep it , come what may . Nobody can take freedom from me while I truly love it , for love will make me willing to defend it to the death against all who would destroy it , both from within and without . Indifference to the common good , selfseeking by politicians and people , lack of love for freedom ? these can lead to the downfall of the nation . But never love of country . I love my country . I look up at her flag , and I see : One hundred and thirty million people , gathered from the ends of the earth and every race and nation , living together in peace ; Thirty million boys and girls , unconscious of race or religion or economic differences , sitting side by side in ten thousand schoolrooms ; Fifty million men and women , known as church members , freely choosing when and how and where they will worship God ; these , and more , just as freely electing their rulers ; The mightiest , the most diversified enterprises ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful land , a beautiful land , a fruitful land , with no cannonmenaced boundary lines and no warships patrolling its mighty rivers , with men and women freely going wherever they choose to go ; America ? free and always to be free , because I love her . I am 130,000,000 strong .
