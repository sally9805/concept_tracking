The stockmarket , as the sum total of many bets on the future , almost always anticipates ( and frequently overanticipates ) good or bad news . Last week , when Italy finally threw in the towel , the market took the good news in traditional style : it went down . But the drop , two-thirds of a point on the Dow-Jones industrial average , was picayune compared to the threeday , 6-point nose dive that followed the fall of Mussolini last July , and was more than made up in the next day 's trading . <P> The drop , on receipt of good news , illustrated anew the dogged pessimism ( or lack of imagination ) with which U.S. investors view the approach of peace . But the quick comeback might mean that U.S. investors are coming around to the British attitude , which seems to be a more realistic appraisal of the fruits of victory . The London market last week , as it has been since Dunkirk , was on the upgrade . While British capital looks eagerly ahead to the war 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production . <P> Four Years , Seven Points . Yet when the Dow-Jones industrial average last week closed at 138 , it was less than 7 points above its August 1939 low . In short , four years of war had little permanent effect on the averages , although production is now running at almost double the 1939 rate . <P> Another fixed notion of marketwise-guys is that corporations with large war contracts are automatically bad bargains as peace becomes more certain , and vice versa . A few grossly inflated war producers ( like aircraft and machine tools ) do face vast uncertainties in reconversion to peace . But among the " war stocks " that sold off fractionally were auto shares , and the auto industry 's postwar prospects are as bright as any other 's . And among the " peace stocks " that boomed were utilities , which have really benefited from zooming war production . <P> Looking Abroad . A third fixed belief is that Allied victories , while supposedly bearish for U.S. securities , are bullish for foreign securities , particularly for those of countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week Italian Superpower common jumped 45% , closed at 14 times its 1943 low . Superpower 's chief recommendation to investors is that it is now one of the two existing avenues for speculation in war-ravaged Italy . ( It , like International Power Securities , is a U.S. company holding investments in Italy ; trading in all direct Italian obligations was frozen by the U.S. Treasury . ) <P> This reasoning , divorced from its lunatic-fringe manifestations , is sound enough : the U.S. investor has too long taken a jaundiced view of the rest of the world . But the new foreign speculation has been accompanied by persistent defeatism about the prospects of many much healthier domestic securities . So far as peace at home is concerned , the average U.S. investor is still suffering from a 1930-style persecution complex .
