Attired in the white silk Buster Brown shirt and leather knee pants of his Master-of-the-Hunt suit , Hermann Goring last week entertained in the vast study of his Karinhall hunting lodge Karl von Wiegand . Month before the No. 1 Hearst foreign correspondent had been given an exclusive interview with the No. 1 Nazi , Adolf Hitler , who wanted to get across the idea that the U. S. had nothing to fear from Germany . The story was neither widely published nor widely believed in the U. S. So the No. 2 Nazi now tried his hand at the same job in the first private interview he had given to a foreign newsman since the war began . <P> According to Correspondent von Wiegand , Marshal of the Reich Gring was not only surprised but irritated that the U. S. should have the slightest anxiety about Germany . Said the Marshal : <P> " To Germany your fear in America of invasion from across the seas strikes us as a strange delusion , and stranger still is the delusion that the invasion is to come from Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 3,000 miles wide on one side and more than 5,000 miles on the other , America is simply not invadable by air or sea . That 's particularly true if America 's armaments and national defense are appropriate to or commensurate with the country 's size , population , resources and industrial production , not to mention the spirit of the people . . . . Militarily it 's absurd . We are not yet in an age of inter-hemisphere air wars . . . . <P> " I stand by what I agreed with Sumner Welles , and that is that sound economic reconstruction and conditions can be arrived at in Europe and in the world only in cooperation with America . "
