William Green and A. F. of L. last week practiced a maneuver that John L. Lewis had used the week before . There was one serious cause of dissension at the A. F. of L. convention in New Orleans and one disturber of the convention 's peace , David Dubinsky , who wanted racketeers purged from A. F. of L. ranks . Week before , in Atlantic City , John L. Lewis had been plagued by the same kind of insurgency , which wanted Communists purged from C. I. O. Lewis had grudgingly approved an anti-Red resolution with rubber teeth . The A. F. of L. hierarchy puffed good cigar smoke , meditated , then took action . <P> To delegates they presented a resolution condemning racketeering in A. F. of L. as " a most difficult evil which calls for the application of every means available . " High-mindedly the delegates passed it . <P> Two days later , still deadpan , the convention re-elected George E. Browne , head of the theatrical workers ' &; stagehands ' union* as one of A. F. of L. 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves by refusing to cast a vote . <P> When Dubinsky led his union out of C. I. O. and back into A. F. of L. last spring , he exacted two promises from President Green : 1 ) the executive council would give up its arbitrary right to suspend unions-the action by which Labor was split four years ago ; 2 ) a 1 per month per member assessment to fight C. I. O. would be repealed , and the Federation 's regular 1 per capita levy doubled to make up the loss in organizing revenue . Last week the Federation made good on the second promise , but reaffirmed the executive council 's right to suspend member unions . <P> Sorrowed Dubinsky : " When John L. Lewis said on the floor of the C. I. O. convention that the I. L. G. W. U. Dubinsky 's garment workers took ' the easy way , ' he was wrong . It was not the easy way . " Then he added philosophically : " It was the wise way and I hope others will realize it and follow it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somnolent convention adjourned it re-elected William Green to his 17th term as president of A. F. of L. and raised his salary from $12,000 to $20,000 a year . Breathed a grateful Mr. Green : " This convention did its work in a dignified and orderly way . . . . The actions we have taken have been wise , sound and unassailable . " <P> <P> *Onetime aide to George Browne was Willie Bioff , Chicago hoodlum and panderer . Another aide : Nick Circella , alias Nick Dean , whose record includes conviction for assault with intent to murder , arrests for robbery .
