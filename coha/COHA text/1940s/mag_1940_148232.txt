Radio 's coast-to-coast bank-night program , as most U. S. tuners now know well , is Tums ' four-month-old Pot o ' Gold , which every Tuesday night rings up some U. S. telephone subscriber to offer him $1,000 , with no strings or Turns attached . <P> Movie theatres and chains now offer prizes equal to Pot o ' Gold 's to coax patrons away from the magic call and into theatres . Information Please , opposite Pot o ' Gold , in self-defense instituted a giveaway on its own high intellectual plane-sets of Encyclopaedia Britannica . On CBS , Competitor Walter O'Keefe , with nothing to give listeners but wit , dwindled off the air middle of last month . <P> To fill the Walter O'Keefe half-hour , and give battle to Pot o ' Gold as well , CBS on Dec. 19 raked up a radio program called Court of Missing Heirs , which had a brisk radio career two years ago in the Midwest , tracing heirs to unclaimed fortunes . Pecking away at a guesstimated pile of $160,000,000 in unclaimed estates in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season has told the world about $350,000 awaiting long-lost brothers , errant sons , all manner of scattered kith &; siblings . <P> Court of Missing Heirs turned up two long-lost heirs apparent , one with a limp , the other with an alias , each with a newsworthy story . <P> . Carl Henry Proehl , a rangy Minneapolis youth , wanted to be a prize fighter , but his father objected . So Carl changed his name to David Barry , fought his share of bouts , in 1925 left town and never saw his folks again . His father died in 1932 , his mother in 1935 , leaving him some $40,000 . In Long Beach , Calif. , meanwhile , David Barry had married a nice girl , fathered two sons , done well with a coffee shop until in 1935 he sold out . His wife got a divorce , but before she did , Barry told her his real name , and she told a Mrs. Pearl Riggert . <P> Last month Mrs. Riggert heard the Court of Missing Heirs broadcast Carl Henry Proehl 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barry , now 40 , spare &; repentant , was on his way to collect his money , promising to use it to assure college educations for his sons , David , 9 , Douglas , 4 . <P> &gt;Jim Jordan , of Culloden , Ga. , went to British Columbia years ago and made a pile in gold . He died last year , left his fortune to his three brothers , Bob , Dan and Gee , an infantile paralysis cripple . Gee 's share was $13,000 . But he had left home years before , after a quarrel . Last Bob &; Dan heard of him , he was peddling shoelaces and razor blades around Pittsburgh . Last week Court of Missing Heirs broadcast Gee Jordan 's case . In Pittsburgh , a 63-year-old " newsboy " friend of 52 - year- old Gee heard the broadcast , located him , sick , in a $2-a-week furnished room . At week 's end , near-toothless , gnarled Gee Jordan rose on his crutches , spruced up , eyed Florida as the place to end his days . <P> Court of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. Waters , a onetime Chicago lawyer , and Alfred E. Shebel , onetime ad agency man . They worked it out in 1935 , peddled it for two years until Skelly Oil bought it in 1937 . They went off the air in 1938 until CBS put it back on for Ironized Yeast last month . They have a field staff of five , digging up romantic and poignant cases . Neither has made a will of his own .
