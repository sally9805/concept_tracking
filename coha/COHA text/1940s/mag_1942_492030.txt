BERNARD M. KELLMURRAY 'S voice came chuckling over the telephone . " No , " he said , " you need n't take a taxi to find McClellan Hall . It is part of the Old Campus of Yale , in the heart of New Haven , and you can almost see it from your hotel window . I 'll tell you exactly how to find it . " He started from the beginning , building an exact visual picture : " When you come out of the front entrance of the hotel , pause a moment and look about you . You will see , diagonally off to your right , a group of buildings . They are mostly what is known as collegiate Gothic in architecture . You know the reaching arches and spires of the Gothic style ? The first buildings you will see are of Indiana limestone , and at casual glance they appear dingy brown in color , because they are weather-beaten . But when you come close and really look , you will see there is a great deal of yellow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , pronouncing them almost lovingly . " These buildings , " he continued , " are connected by ornamental iron gates , some of them quite elaborately worked , with almost lacework of iron above them . They are painted black  --  a rich black . Enter any one of these gates . Inside you will find flagged and tree-lined walks crisscrossing and angling in all directions . Inside the square , too , you will find two Colonial-type buildings , almost identical in size and shape . " At this point Kellmurray could have said , as it developed later , that one had a statue in front of it , and that the other , where he was , did not . Instead , he continued to elaborate : " Both these buildings have many windows , with the woodwork painted fresh , clean white , and with slatted shutters painted green . Both are mostly of red brick . But you will see that the walls of one are far more thickly covered with ivy than the other , and that the bricks of one are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am in the newer , brighter one . Oh , yes . It is the one without a statue in front of it . " Kellmurray is an intelligent man and a scholar . Ordinarily he speaks succinctly and directly to the point . But for a while , in these last few months , he indulged in an orgy of visually evocative words . He luxuriated , perhaps unconsciously , in talk of color and sights . This was because , after being apparently doomed to spend his life in darkness , he suddenly got a reprieve from the night . For nearly five years he was blind and now , as if by a miracle , he can see again . The story of what happened to Bernard Michael Kellmurray is I. e a miracle play falling in three parts . The first is a picture of a young man , healthy and intensely alive ; and the curtain to that one is a curtain in more senses than one . The second consists of a slow and bitter adjustment to a life of blindness , but it closes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Kellmurray made that adjustment brilliantly , and , in so doing , achieved a dream . The third is that of the miracle , the unexpected recovery of sight after all hope was gone . Kellmurray was twenty-six when it happened . There was nothing in the past to forewarn him that he might someday lose his sight . There was no history of blindness in his family , and he had no disease or injury . Even when the night started to creep upon him , neither he nor his doctors realized what was happening . He was a handsome young man , with crisply wavy blond hair , a sensitive face and alive , blue-gray eyes . He was a graduate of Yale and loved books , the opera and the theater . He was athletically built ? five feet nine and nearly 170 pounds  --  and shot golf in the low seventies . During his summer college vacations he acted as assistant pro at the Ausable Club at St. Hubert 's , in Essex County , New York . He played tennis and swam and coached baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen in and out of love a half dozen times . Life was good , though he did n't know yet exactly what he wanted to do with it . Once , while still in college , he had toyed with the idea of learning to become a moving-picture producer . That was while he was acting with The Dramat , the Yale undergraduate dramatic group . There was even a job in the offing for a while , but the studio failed and nothing came of it . After graduation he taught Spanish in a Utica high school for a year and tutored Latin on the side . When his father died in 1933 he took over the management of his garage and automobile agency for a year . In the back of his mind always was.the thought that what he really wanted to do , when he got around to it , was to go into educational and vocational guidance work , preferably at Yale . But there was a depression on , and he needed money for postgraduate work to fit him for that field ; and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a politician he got a stopgap job as an auditor with the AAA in Washington , and then switched over to the PWA in the same kind of job . Summer Twilight I THE summer of 1936 Kellmurray had an at- i tack of pleurisy . Maybe that has no bearing on what followed ; the doctors wo n't say definitely . But , searching for a beginning somewhere , Kellmurray thinks that may have been it , and the doctors say that is a likely assumption . Kellmurray took it so lightly he went to a party and returned to work before he was fully recovered . That resulted in a relapse . Even then he was n't seriously ill . Soon after he was out again , however , he began to notice he was having trouble with his eyes . Things began to grow dim . He paid little attention to it at first . After all , he had just been ill , and was working hard , and his job imposed a strain on his eyes . Then he began to notice that he was driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many narrow escapes from running into other cars and into pedestrians . He lived thirty-five minutes from the PWA offices , and driving was the most practicable way to get to and from work . For a while he tried following other cars closely , and stopping and starting when they did . But this got to be too dangerous , and so , early in October , 1936 , he got a leave of absence and went home to Utica . He thought all he needed were a good rest and the advice of an oculist . He got the rest , but no noticeable improvement . If the doctors he went to at that time knew what was happening , they did not tell him and successfully kept him from guessing . lContinued on Page 65 ) It seemed to him they were puzzled . 's house , and went back to Washington . Now he could barely read the expense accounts and reports he had to pass on . Everybody was helpful , but he knew his work was deteriorating . There was no blurring or swimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now there was no possibility of driving , and he needed the aid of a magnifying glass to read . " It was like , " he says , " sitting in a slowly darkening room . " Then panic began to set in . With his left eye , by this time , he could distinguish only light . Darkness was closing in on the right eye . Only the will to survive and the eternal persistence of hope would not let him say even to himself that he was truly going blind . The fear and rising panic grew more out of a dread of losing , even temporarily , his freedom of action , his individual independence . This was always to be his greatest terror and then his greatest sense of loss . By the end of January , 1937 , he dared no longer go on . He left Washington then because , he says , " I was afraid that if I remained any longer I would need to be taken home . " He still could n't believe it . " Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had moments of depression and despair when I feared this was blindness for all my life . But these would pass , and I would cling again to the faith that a long rest and good doctoring would cure me . " He went to live with his widowed mother , Mrs. Elizabeth Kane Kellmurray , and his sister , Mrs. John H. Reilly , in Utica . He rested and took tonics and made the rounds of the doctors . For nearly two months he could not even get a definite diagnosis . Then he visited a noted ophthalmologist . He had n't gone to an eye specialist before because he still blamed his trouble on overwork and his general run-down condition . The specialist had an apparatus which enabled him to see into Kellmurray 's eyes . He promptly gave the diagnosis of retrobulbar neuritis.like one of the Weird Sisters This meant that , perhaps as a result of the pleurisy , he had developed neuritis in the optic nerves back of the eyeballs . Now a progressive atrophy was beginning . This diagnosis was made in March , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mean , doctor , " he said , trying to hold his voice steady , " that I 'm going to be blind ? " " I would n't say that , " replied the specialist . " We 'll see what we can do for you . " As he looks hack on it now , Kellmurray sees this should have warned him . But the human mind dreads the finality of blindness too much . The specialist sent a description of the case and his own diagnosis to the Mayo Clinic , asking if they could do anything for Kellmurray there beyond what he could do for him . The reply was no , but it was sympathetic and did not close the door of hope . Kellmurray clung to the fact that now , at least , there was an accurate diagnosis . Now , at least , there was something definite to combat . This , though he was too intelligent not to guess the odds , sustained him . The spring went by , and the summer came , and the sun grew brighter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind . In his right eye he still had light perception  --  that is , he could barely distinguish day from night  --  but with his left he could see nothing . There was one last resort . This was a series of ten intravenous injections ; a classic but too often unsuccessful treatment for neuritis . How much hope the specialist had for their success Kellmurray does not know . He was not , at that stage , asking many questions . He was afraid to . The specialist sent him to his family physician for the injections . They were given daily . On a hot afternoon in mid-July , Kellmurray was lying on the surgical table in the doctor 's office . The nurse had just given him the last of the injections  --  a needle prick in the arm , a barely perceptible feeling of fluid being forced in , the coolness of the alcohol-saturated swab , cleansing . A minute or two passed . Then a warm , friendly hand closed on his own . He heard the quiet , compassionate voice of the elderly doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start learning Braille right away ? " That was how Kellmurray , not yet twenty-seven , learned that he was hopelessly blind . Now began , the slow , bitter adjustment , though first there was a period of almost blank despair . The specialist and other medical men confirmed the verdict . They now told him plainly that there was no hope . Sometimes , in the past , when he had seen a blind person , he had wondered idly , out of a wide-ranging intellectual curiosity , what it was like to be blind . Now he knew . It had happened to him . The shock carried its own opiate , and that was numbness . For weeks he just sat , staring sightlessly , growing thinner , weaker of will every day . Sometimes he sat meekly on the porch in the sun if he was led there ; but mostly in the house , where people could n't see him . He , who a few years ago had earned his living teaching boys games in summer camps and playgrounds , who had shown other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and to use their muscles with authority in golf , now had to be led around . He , whose life , even above sports , had been concerned with books , now could not even read . He began to turn to the radio , " but it was no real compensation . " Above all , he hated and was most terrorized by his helplessness , by what he calls " the loss of individual freedom and independence . " This , he declared in an essay he wrote later for his degree of master of arts at Yale , was a feeling common to all the blind who had not always been blind . His resentment was so great that he showed it to those who tried to help him . He remembers wryly now what a trial he must have been to his devoted mother and sister , already stricken to the heart by what had happened to him . He winced from the hands of friends who tried to guide him . There was a young woman in Utica whom it had seemed likely he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was solicitous and tender ; and that was just the trouble . He resented openly her solicitude and the dependence on his part that it implied . The engagement , if so it could be called , had not reached the formal stage , and so it was not broken . " It just sort of died out . " Groping Rack But this resentment was also a sign of renascence . Kellmurray had been too active physically and intellectually to sit numb and brooding forever . His mind began to cast about again , seeking an escape from this prison . At first this flexing of mental and psychic muscles took the form of going hack over the past . His boyhood in Utica , the praise he got because he finished high school in three years , the championship playground baseball team he coached in 1929 , the years as an undergraduate at Yale , the teaching in Utica , which he did not like ; the garage business , which he did like , but at which he had failed ; the two and a half years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all had been at Yale . Those four years stood out in more pleasant detail than any other period . He remembered now that he had known at nine that he wanted to go to Yale , after reading the Frank Merriwell books . He remembered now that Yale had n't been like those stories when he got there , but that there he had , for the first and only time , found what he wanted . He remembered now , with a poignant sense of loss and desire , how he had always planned to go back , to work there , spend his life there . One day , seated in the sun on the porch , he said to himself , Well , why not ? What had seemed impractical enough before was apparently impossible now that he was blind and helpless . But the more he thought of it the more he saw that this had always been his dream , and that now he had to do it to prove himself and to save himself . He faltered his own way into the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the New York State Commission for the Blind . How could they help him to learn Braille ? This , he knew , would have to be the first step . A teacher of Braille came to his home within a few days . Braille is a system of embossed symbols for the letters of the alphabet , punctuation , common combinations of letters and simple , frequently recurring words , to be read through the fingers by sense of touch . Kellmurray threw himself into this study so furiously that he acquired in three months a facility usually not attained for a year . It was like , Kellmurray says , a crack in a door leading from a dark room . The teacher herself inspired him , because she , too , was blind , and yet she had attained a considerable degree of self-sufficiency and independence . His weight , which had gone down to 110 pounds , started to climb again . He began to school himself toward facing again a world he could no longer see and never expected to see again . He taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first fumbling , embarrassed attempts , to feed himself with ordinary table implements . At first he spilled his food and missed with his spoon and stuck his cheek with his fork . When at last he ventured out to dine , it gave him great pride to discover that new companions , unwarned , could not tell from his table technique that he was blind . The surface appearance of his eyes was not marred , and he trained himself to gaze in the direction of the voice that addressed him , and to appear as if he were looking where he was going . He practiced letting his gaze wander about a room as a sighted person normally would do . He began going out to parties . It was slow , painful work , with many bitter moments and some of acute despair . Light on Darkness His mother and sister never quite got used to the fact of his blindness . His mother several times forgot . She would say , " Look how pretty the flowers are now , " or ask , " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His friends , too , made such mistakes , but by now they were sources of pride to him rather than pain . He found he had a keener perception of sound and smell , a greater sensitivity of touch , a closer recognition of distances between things he touched and locations he knew . But Kellmurray strikes repeatedly , in his essay for his master 's degree , against what he calls " the fallacious doctrine of compensation . " He points out that " touch can never become a perfect substitute for sight . " And he denies that " the blind , as members of society and even as human beings , are . . . possessed of the ' mystical ' qualities which are often attributed to them . " There were still incidents which brought sharply home to him his differences from the " sighted , " as the blind say of those who can see . Sometimes these were amusing , such as one during a violent rainstorm one night . He sat with his mother and sister in the living room , absorbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucy Gayheart . His sister was reading a book , and his mother the newspaper . Suddenly the lights went out and the radio went dead . His mother and sister cried out , calling directions to each other in the dark . " Please , " he complained without thought , " do n't make so much noise . Ca n't you see I 'm reading ? " A contrasting incident had no such humor . It was , in fact , frightening . It grew out of the second step he knew he had to take along the path to independence . This was the acquisition of a Seeing Eye dog . He had written to Seeing Eye , Inc. , had been investigated and had received a letter telling him to come to their headquarters at Morristown , New Jersey , on January 30 , 1938 , prepared to stay for a month of training with a dog . Kellmurray refused to allow anyone to accompany him . From the station at Utica he wired a request for a Travelers Aid representative to meet him at New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons not blind needed Travelers Aid . The representative put him on a bus for Orange . He got there all right , left that bus , and stood on a street corner to wait for another bus to take him to Morristown . It was five o'clock of a Sunday afternoon . He heard busses go by , but he could not tell which one to hail . There was no sound of walking feet , no sound of voices . The corner seemed deserted . He felt utterly alone in the world , in the darkness . " In those terrible moments I felt worse than ever before , I think , or since , " he says . " I was so helpless . I was afraid . " He was wearing dark glasses and carrying a white cane . Usually he resented them , for the black of the glasses and the whiteness of the cane were primarily badges to warn people that the wearer was blind . But now they rescued him . A man came along , recognized the symbols and put him on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he knew he needed that additional independence and facility of movement if he was to attain his goal . He was not prepared for Shep . Even today Kellmurray feels that his meeting with that dog was the most important of his life . Four-Footed Friend Kellmurray was never alone again , in all the rest of his blindness . Shep took away almost the last vestige of helplessness , of dependence . With the dog in his harness Kellmurray could go anywhere , do so many things his blindness had barred him from before . A Seeing Eye dog , in a fashion almost miraculous to behold , will direct his master through traffic , even interpreting traffic lights . He will prevent him from bumping into anything , will keep him away from and protect him against danger . A Seeing Eye dog will never bark except as warning or greeting , will bite no one who does not seek to hurt his master , will never leave his master , will not be distracted from his duty by another dog , or by a cat , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his master 's moods and desires , and to anticipate them in a manner almost unbelievable . Shep , a magnificent German shepherd dog , a breed commonly miscalled police dog , became a part of him . " I mean that literally , " says Kellmurray . " I never , after the first few days , thought of him as a separate entity . I could not think of myself without him . He was not a dog to me , nor another creature . He was simply part of me . " He went often now to the theater , to concerts , to the movies . Seeing Eye dogs are allowed everywhere , because they know how to behave anywhere , but on one trip to the movies Shep 's solicitude for his master caused an embarrassing disturbance . With that amazing understanding of his kind , the dog led his master to a seat down front , where Kellmurray could hear better . This , because Kellmurray , of course , followed the action entirely through his hearing , was important . Shep crouched silently at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade-mark appeared on the screen and roared . Instantly Shep went into action , barking his defiance and springing to the defense of his master . He tried to leap at the screen to get at the lion . Fortunately , Kellmurray still had hold of his harness , and at a word from him Shep subsided , though he quivered aggressively for a time . Dream Comes True Now Kellmurray felt he was ready for the final phase of his campaign-to try to sell others on the idea that he , a blind man , could be a useful citizen and guide others in their education . He began to write letters and to call upon people whom he needed to persuade . He had ideas for a thesis on education of the blind and for research he could do that might point the way to better understanding and training of the blind . This would justify scholarships to finance that research . Because he came , not begging but with ideas and the offer to do useful work , he began to get sympathetic hearings . The American Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Blind , The Lighthouse in New York , and the officials of Yale became interested . Two of his old mentors of undergraduate days , Dr. C. W. Mendell , who had been dean of the college , and Dr. Chauncey B. Tinker , who had taught him English , took a hand . Dean Edgar S. Furniss , of the Graduate School , became convinced . And above all , Kellmurray sold himself and his idea to Dr. Albert S. Crawford , director of the Department of Personnel Study and the Bureau of Appointments at Yale . It had been an impossible thing he had set himself to do , and the climb was long and hard , because at times he had to fight himself as well . But , in September , 1939 , Kellmurray went back to Yale . He went as a scholarship graduate student , with two jobs in addition . One was under Doctor Crawford , and the other was that of freshman counselor . He was at last where he wanted to be and doing exactly what he had always wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was reasonably happy now in his rooms in McClellan Hall , listening to the problems of freshmen . Acting as a " sort of second assistant secretary " to Doctor Crawford , with the aid of dictating machines and a student reader , was preparation for the career he wanted , and also gave him the sense of independence and earning his way that he greatly needed . Working on his essay for his master 's degree  --  again with the aid of dictating machines and a reader  --  gave him the knowledge he was doing something useful . He made more friends than ever before . He went out more than ever before . He took girls to dinner and concerts , the theater and the movies . He went to many parties . A young woman who met him at a party was impressed by what she described to friends afterward as his " conversational brilliance . " . Only afterward did she learn he was blind , He went swimming , and did fairly well , though there was a new timidity because he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He tried dancing again , and was rather successful at it , though he says he had never cared much for it anyway and so did not persevere . He even played golf again . Friends teed the ball for him and lined him up . He would stoop and feel the ball . Then he would straighten and swing . Considering that the first rule in golf is " Keep your eye on the ball , " he got phenomenal drives . Some were 250 yards . His approach shots were remarkably good , too , but on the green , of course , his game collapsed . Nevertheless , his plaint about his putting sounds more like a duffer 's than a blind man 's . " Sometimes , " he laments , " I 'd need six putts to hole the ball . " All this was no true compensation . His master 's essay , The Education of the Blind in the United States : 18321940 , is impersonal , but here and there it gives flashes of insight into how keenly he felt his blindness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensation " speaks eloquently on that point . No matter how he adjusted himself , no matter what face he put on it for the world , his was still a life of darkness . There still were times when his spirit sagged , and when , alone in his rooms , he railed against his fate . There had been cases of recovery from his type of blindness , but they were so rare that he had not been told about them , for it would have been unkind to raise a hope with such staggering odds against it . There was in his apartment a bed that folded into the wall . This he referred to as " an invention of the devil , " and he more than half feared it . One day last September his fears were justified . It struck his foot , injuring it painfully . When the pain persisted he called a doctor , who bandaged it and told him to rest it . Annoyingly , the injury , though slight , refused to heal properly . The reopening of the fall term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in mid-September , Kellmurray entered the college infirmary to see if they could speed recovery . He was discovered to be run-down and nervous ; and so , heavy doses of Vitamin B1 were prescribed . He was told to continue them for months . Campus Miracle Whether this had anything to do with what followed , no doctor will say officially . There is no scientific proof one way or the other . Kellmurray and his doctors speak of it as they mention the pleurisy which preceded his blindness . One thing seemed to follow the other , and that 's as far as they will go . At 4:30 in the afternoon of November 10 , 1941 , Kellmurray sat in the red easy chair nearest the windows of his sitting room . He was listening to the radio . Shep , as always , was at his feet . Suddenly his right eye began to water freely . Tears ran down his cheek . This had never happened before , and Kellmurray sat there tense , wondering what this presaged , and afraid . And then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked down , and there was Shep . So often he had wondered exactly what Shep , who meant so much to him , looked like . And now he saw . He got to his feet , and Shep , anxious , rose too . He began walking about the room , fingering things he had known only through touch . He wanted to assure himself that he really saw them . He wanted to be sure he was n't dreaming . And then Shep , whining joyfully , leaped up and began licking his eyes . Kellmurray believes Shep knew he had regained his sight . He believes Seeing Eye dogs can tell . He points out that a Seeing Eye dog lying on the floor or path will get out of the way when a blind person approaches , but remain at ease if the oncomer has sight . He sat down again . He was so violently shaken he was nauseated . He could not think coherently . He dared not believe it was true . It was only the right eye that had recovered sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . None of it might last . Some friends , two men and a woman , came in . He did not tell them what had happened . They noticed he was distraught , and after a few minutes they left . By the time they left , the sight of that right eye was dimming again . He hurried across to the quarters of his current reader and personal friend , John H. Kennedy , a graduate student in history . He was due there anyway . He and Kennedy were to take two young women to dinner and the concert that evening . Kennedy took one look at him . " What 's the matter , Kell ? Do n't you feel well ? " " No , " said Kellmurray . " Look , I do n't think I can make it for dinner and the concert . Make my apologies to the girls , will you ? Tell them I ? " And then he blurted out to his friend , " John , for a half hour I had vision in my right eye . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy said , " Oh . " That was all . He saw Kellmurray was too shaken to talk . The girls arrived . " Do n't say anything about it , " Kellmurray whispered . Kennedy explained , " Kell does n't feel well , " and they could see that was so . They dropped him at his quarters and went on . Kellmurray telephoned Dr. Eugene M. Blake , clinical professor of ophthalmology in the Yale Graduate School of Medicine . Doctor Blake was familiar with his case . Kellmurray told him what had happened . Doctor Blake was encouraging . " It sounds promising , " he said . " Go to bed . " Before he fell asleep , Kellmurray had a brief flash of sight in that eye again . Then it faded out and he slept . He was awakened at 11:15 P.M. by Kennedy 's entrance . Kennedy switched on the light . " My God , you 're ugly ! " said Kellmurray . And then he burst out laughing , because he could see again . Later he tried to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is n't ugly at all , already understood he had only been trying to mask the sudden welling of joy with a wisecrack . Sight never faded from that eye again . Instead it strengthened steadily . But the left eye remained completely blind in the days that ensued . He told his superiors about it , including Dr. Norman S. Buck , dean of freshmen , and they advised him to coast along and see what developed . The medical men told him this was the real thing ; that sight had come to that eye to stay and improve , but that they could n't predict definitely about the other eye . Nine days went by . College closed for the Thanksgiving holidays , and Kellmurray went to spend them with his friends , Dr. and Mrs. Arthur H. Morse , in Hamden , a suburb of New Haven . It was 11:30 o'clock on Thanksgiving Eve . Doctor Morse had an early call the next day and had retired . Kellmurray and Mrs. Morse were sitting by the fireplace , listening to a recording of Flagstad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly his left eye began to tear copiously , exactly as the other had that fateful afternoon . For a moment , afraid to hope , he tried to conceal it from Mrs. Morse . Then an exclamation broke from him as the thing he was afraid to hope for happened . " I can see ! " he cried . " I can see with both eyes now ! " Reprieve From Night That is how Bernard Michael Kellmurray , at thirty-one , got his reprieve from the night . The doctors say it is , barring an entirely new and unrelated disease or injury to his eyes , a permanent one . Two months after he regained his sight he could see well enough to recognize friends at twenty feet . Improvement , the doctors said , should continue for some time . He never will regain the keen vision he had when he was a golf professional , and he may always need strong glasses for more than casual reading . But he can see again , and there is no longer the specter of a life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical change about him , He was surprised more by how little change there was in the appearance of things . Automobiles were somewhat more streamlined , and women 's hats looked as if " they were playing a joke . " But that was about all . He slipped easily into a world that seemed to have marked time for him . He intends to continue at Yale , to work for a Ph.D . degree , and to spend his life in educational and vocational guidance work . Already he has taken on additional duties . When war broke out he offered to enlist . He was told he could do more good in the Bureau of Military Training information which was set up at Yale . So he took on that work in addition to his role of freshman counselor and his job in Doctor Craw-ford 's office .

One of the first things that struck him when he regained his sight was : " What about Shep ? I ca n't bear to lose him . " There was the moral obligation , however , so he called W. H. Ebeling , executive vice president of Seeing Eye , Inc . He told him what had happened and how he felt about Shep . " Keep him , " said Ebeling , " but take his harness off . " Shep adjusted himself easily to the new conditions . Where previously he had accepted his harness willingly , even eagerly , now he resented it .
