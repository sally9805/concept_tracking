Like a beautiful painting without warmth . . . the figure without a bosom . But put the flat-chested woman in the proper foundation . . . giving the illusion of soft , sweet curves . . . . - From an ad by Manhattan 's swank Bonwit Teller . <P> If busts are back , can bustles be far behind ? But busts are not all the way back , for " Dr. " Jean Paul Fernel has failed again . Mincing , dapper , wax-mustached Jean Paul Fernel has thrice lost his doctor 's license since he graduated from the University of Illinois College of Medicine in 1911 . Last week the Food &; Drug Administration got him convicted in Chicago District Court . On trial with " Dr. " Fernel was Fernel 's " Breasts of Youth , " a brand of capsules which he peddled ( at $5 for a month 's supply ) through ads in Beauty and Health News , a " bimonthly " that came out whenever he got around to it . Sample quote : " A lovely breast is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popularity and success are largely due to the beauty of her breasts . " The U.S. District Attorney charged that " the product was misrepresented in that the name suggested it was efficacious to cure underdeveloped , atrophied , flabby and pendulous breasts and . . . to develop the firm , well-developed breasts of youth . " An abashed user of the capsules , Mrs. Lucille Frances Hinton Moody , 42 , bravely testified that she had always been " thin and never fully developed , " had taken one package of capsules with no perceptible result . She began on another package just to give Breasts of Youth a break . Somewhere in package No. 2 she got disgusted , turned the stuff over to a Food &; Drug inspector . <P> The Court found that Breasts of Youth contained some moisture , common salt , magnesium and an unidentified ovarian substance . Dr. Willard O. Thompson , associate professor of medicine at the University of Illinois College of Medicine , testified : " No food I know of will act on the breasts alone or develop them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( among them : Fernel 's Nerve and Brain Food , which Northwestern 's Professor A. J. Carlson said " would have no more effect than a fly speck on the Wrigley Building , " the Court found the defendant guilty on seven counts , sentenced him to a $500 fine and a year in prison on each count , to be served concurrently . For Jean Paul Fernel , who once skipped bail in Detroit when charged with having his patients ' clothes frisked while he gave them medical examinations , this was his first conviction .
