In spite of air raids , in spite of the al most constant presence of Jerries on reconnaissance , the chores of anticipation went on . Husky Major General Bernard Cyril Freyberg , in command of the whole is land 's expectancy , still rode to work in a broken-down two-horse carriage , with his feet cocked up and a pipe in his mouth . <P> In little Suda village the soldiers and sailors and Greek stevedores kept at their perilous labors of unloading freighters laden with munitions for the slimly equipped defenders . The keyed-up troops marched along country lanes renamed Wavell 's Way , 42nd Street , Greenery Street . <P> High on the hills , among the shining olive trees , the stubby vines , patches of already plumply headed wheat , fields of potato just being put in behind primitive wooden stakeplows , sat the tiny chapels . <P> There devout peasants devised rituals against what they knew was to come . <P> Even the antiquity of the place and its traditions seemed braced against the expected . Cretans reminded themselves that their island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces went forth to great naval conquests ; that the greatest god of them all , Zeus , had spent his boy hood on Mount Ida ; that an air attack on Crete would be flying in the face of classical omen , for it was from Crete that in cautious Icarus flew to man 's first crash landing . <P> Last week the expected Germans came . <P> Their attack on the 160-mile-long island was the most ingenious they have yet es sayed . <P> Out of the Blue . The evening of May 19 closed in quietly . There was a low-lying broken overcast . Apprehension was strung to battle pitch , for R.A.F. reconnaissance had seen extensive preparations on the air fields of southern Greece . <P> Early in the night the Luftwaffe 's evil incubus fell over the island . Soldiers said later the scene was like a bad dream : flares shedding their unnatural light , Stukas making their unnatural shriek . The big , new Messerschmitt nos came in to strafe . The objects of this first phase were to confuse the defenders , cripple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make Crete 's three main airfields incipient citadels for the invaders by ringing them with craters , knock out the anti-aircraft defenses . <P> Some time after midnight the second phase began . About 100 Junkers and Focke-Wulf transport planes flying in vies ( V-shaped formations ) at about 400 feet , swept in over the Canea-Malemi-Suda Bay area ( see map , p. 23 ) . Each outside plane disgorged about ten men wearing leather jackets , crash helmets , kneepads and pistols , with two little tin boxes of iron and chocolate rations strapped to their chests . <P> As they floated down , the men were not easy marks , for they were only in the air about 25 seconds and as they fell they swung violently like human pendulums . Planes in the center of the formations dropped rifles , submachine guns , machine guns , light mortars and ammunition hung from bunched , distinctively marked parachutes . It took each man about ten minutes to get out of his harness and arm himself . Then he picked a shell hole or clump of trees or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
