Franklin Roosevelt stuffed another cigaret in his ivory holder , leaned far back in his big chair , told his press conference , as usual , that he had " no news except . . . . " Then he proceeded to fill out the " except . " <P> Postwar . Franklin Roosevelt wanted newsmen to understand he was not " cool " toward the Ball resolution for early action on postwar objectives . The details , he said , were something for the Senate to work out ; but he endorsed the general idea . He thought it would be helpful for the world to know that the U.S. is ready &; willing to help in maintaining future peace . In fact , plans are already afoot for as many as six United Nations conferences on various phases of the whole postwar problem . One such conference , to ponder questions of nutrition and food distribution , would be held within two months-in some small town , he hoped , any town other than Washington . In Washington the press gave too much interference . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read newsmen a lecture on the press . The trouble with the Washington press , said he , was its efficiency . That was why he wanted to hold United Nations food conferences safely outside Washington . The President said newsmen had " pets " among many of the officials , and the officials had " pets " among newsmen . The North Atlantic and Casablanca conferences , he implied , were successful because the press was absent . <P> Manpower . Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson and Under Secretary Robert P. Patterson had endorsed compulsory national labor service . Newsmen scented an Administration quarrel . But their questions struck no fire : there was no disagreement , said Franklin Roosevelt . The only question was when , if ever , such a law would be necessary . The law would create a lot more Government machinery , make life more complicated , lead to increased regimentation . And while there had to be some regimentation in time of war , the President hoped the National Service Act could be avoided . At least it should be delayed as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Franklin Roosevelt had spent a crowded week . Into his office had marched a long parade of visitors . Vice Admiral Raymond A. Fenard , 56 , balding chief of the Giraud-ist French naval mission , had brought a model of the 35,000-ton French battleship Richelieu . Builder Henry J. Kaiser brought another model , of the new 514-ft. aircraft carriers that will roll off the ways of his Vancouver shipyards at the rate of six a month by the end of 1943 . Bearing no gifts , but only urgent business , had come such men as Cordell Hull , Sumner Welles , Lieut . General George C. Kenney , Allied Air Forces Commander in the Southwest Pacific . <P> At week 's end , after a week 's hard work as President , after deciding as a rationed citizen to give up his breakfast coffee for milk* , Franklin Roosevelt came down with a cold , his second in a month . <P> <P> *For a viewpoint that would be unsympathetic to this change , see p. 56.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
