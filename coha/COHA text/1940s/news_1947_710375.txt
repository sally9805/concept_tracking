txt The New York Telephone Company served notice yesterday on the four metropolitan telephone unions , whose membership of 35,000 workers has been idle for nearly three weeks , that it would not be bound by any formula or ' settlement that may be reached in Washington . It is ready to enter negotiations , the company said , on a local basis " without waiting for someone to lead the way " and will not agree to a settlement except on that basis . Hope for a settlement was revived last night as company and union officials agreed to meet at 2 P. M. today in a joint session . Ronald W. Haughton , special assistant to United States Conciliation Director Edgar Warren , made the announcement but cautioned against undue optimism . The projected meeting , the fourth joint conference since the strike began and the first one in ten , days , will be exploratory in nature and can not be construed as the formal opening of negotiations . it was emphasized . The meeting will be held in the Gramercy Park Hotel . Represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four striking unions : the Union of Telephone Workers , the Traffic Employes Association , the United Telephone Organizations and the TeleJphone Employes Organization , the accounting union . In Washington , Secretary of Labor Lewis B. Schwellenbach conferred with leaders on both sides as three sets of conferees met simultaneously . Joseph A. Beirne , National Federation of Telephone Workers chief , said he hoped for an agreement by tomorrow but added that he had nothing on which to base the hoped Mr. Haughton and Copciliation Commissioner J. R. Mandelbaum met twice yesterday with the executive boards of the unions . Between these sessions the conciliators talked with company heads at a secret meeting . After the second meeting with the unions Mr. Haughton telephoned to Oscar M. Taylor , vice president and general manager of the company , at his home . Mr. Taylor gave the company 's acceptance for the - conference . Union officials said that " nothing new was offered , but we 're willing to resume talks tomorrow . " The announcement followed . The conciliators would not say on what basis the meeting was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headquarters of the Union of Telephone Workers at 205 Blast Forty-second Street , the strike situation appeared at its worst . Commenting on the rejection on Friday of the mediation plan drafted by Mr. Mandelbaum , Carl Whitmore , president of the New York Telephone Company , served notice that it would not be bound by any formula or settlement that may be reached in Washington or elsewhere . It was ready to enter negotiations , he said , on a local basis " without waiting for someone to lead the way " and it would not agree to a settlement excepting on that basis . Mr. Whitmore , however , left the door open for acceptance of the Mandelbaum peace draft despite the fact that the company previously had set yesterday as the ' deadline for acceptance . For the first time the company officially made known that the proposals called for negotiations between the unions and the company in New York and provided for local arbitration of wage issues if the negotiations failed . It termed the proposals fair to both sides , and said it was " most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the unions either were unwilling to *settle the issues or were unable to negotiate " because of commitments made to other union groups . " " We hope that these unions , " Mr. Whitmore said in his statement commenting on the rejection , " are not awaiting settlements of telephone disputes at other locations on the assumption that such agreements will be a pattern in a local settlement . The manage , ment of the New York Telephone Company is ready to settle this dispute without advice or interference from any outside organization and without waiting for someone else to lead the way . We think the unions should be equally independent . " Union Modifies Demands At the early afternoon meeting with union officials Mr. Haughton found a willingness to accept a figure less than the $6 a week increase asked by the NFTW , but the union heads were adamant on a " down payment . " He said he thought they had mentioned an increase of $4 weekly , but a union official , after " checking , " said this was not to be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the union heads would consider even a nominal offer as a base for negotiation , but that now , after the membership had been out for so long a time , they could not back down on their demand for a " down payment " of some kind as a prerequisite for negotiations . The conciliator recalled that in the negotiations in the recent Western Union strike threat the figure of 5 cents was mentioned " casually , " but that this eventually was used to effect , a ' settlement . The situation in New Jersey , where 12,000 operators are out , remained deadlocked . No new conferences were scheduled . On the twentieth day of the strike the American Telephone and Telegraph Company said reports received from Bell System companies indicated no substantial change in general telephone service . Companies were still handling about 80 per cent of the normal number of local cals and in struck areas toll and long-distance service continued to be about 40 per cent of normal .                @ @ @ @ @
