This week , Harry Truman reluctantly and with " deep disappointment " signed the anti-inflation bill sent to him by the Republican-led Congress , and then set out to make some political ammunition from his action . In a note to Congress he said : <P> " At a time when nearly everyone in this nation is feeling the pressure of exorbitant prices , the Congress has enacted a bill that is pitifully inadequate . . . . The meager authority contained in the bill will be utilized to the fullest extent by the Government , but the public must not be misled into believing that this bill will do the job . I would be shirking my responsibility if I did not protest . . . . " <P> Too Little ? The only reason he signed the bill at all , the President wrote , was because it covered three of the ten points contained in the program he submitted to Congress in November : extended export controls , extended control over rail facilities , authority to promote increased farm production . These three measures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " they are of minor importance compared with . . . the key measures which are essential to an effective anti-inflation program . " In particular , the President wanted stand-by authority for compulsory allocations , rationing and wage-price controls . <P> What he actually got from Congress was 1 ) power to authorize " voluntary " industrial allocation agreements , and 2 ) a suggestion that he submit-for future consideration by Congress , detailed proposals for specific mandatory measures . These provisions of the bill , he cried , were " an excuse for delaying the enactment of a sound anti-inflation program . They will do far more harm than good . " <P> Too Late ? The President said he had already done his best to get voluntary action from businessmen . These efforts had produced " some results , " but it was now " far too late in the fight against inflation ... to place our main reliance " on them . <P> As everyone knows , inflation will be a central issue in the 1948 campaign . Harry Truman got his licks in early : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people-all the American people-with a grave danger . Unchecked inflation can bring on a serious depression that can cause untold hardship . . . . The American people look to the Congress to pass legislation adequate to perform this all-important task . I trust that when the Congress returns it will promptly enact an effective , workable program . "
