' This is Mr. Terby 's first story in a national magazine . He was born twenty-seven years ago in Augusta , Georgia . A former col- lege instructor , he now works for the Ford Motor Company . HEALTH CARD A Story FRANK YERBY 1.64 j OHNNY stood under one of the street lights on the corner and tried to read the letter . The street lights down in the " Bottom " were so dim that he could n't make out half the words , but he did n't need to : he knew them all by heart anyway . " Sugar , " he read , " it took a long time but 1 done it . I got the money to come to see you . I waited and waited for them to give you a furlough , but it look like they do n't mean to . Sugar , I ca n't wait no longer . I got to see you . I got to . Find a nice place for me to stay  --  where we can be happy together . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lily . " Johnny folded the letter up and put it back in his pocket . Then he walked swiftly down the street past all the juke joints with the music blaring out and the GI brogans pounding . He turned down a side street , scuffing up a cloud of dust as he did so . None of the streets down in Black Bottom was paved , and there were four inches of fine white powder over everything . When it rained , the mud would come up over the tops of his Army shoes , but it had n't rained in nearly thrcc months . There were no juke joints on this street , and the Negro shanties were neatly whitewashed . Johnny kept on walking until he came to the end of the street . On the corner stood the littlewhitewashed Baptist Church , and next to it was the neat , well-kept home of the pastor . Johnny went up on the porch and hesitated . He thrust his hand in his pocket and the paper crinkled . He took his hand out and knocked on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called . " It 's me , " Johnny answered ; " it 's a sodjer . " The door opened a crack , and the woman peered out . She was middle-aged and fat . Looking down , Johnny could see that her feet were bare . " Whatcha want , sodjer ? " Johnny took off his cap . " Please , Mam , lemme come in . I kin explain it t yuh better settin down . " She studied his face for a minute in the darkness . " Aw right , " she said ; " you kin come in , son ! ' Johnny entered the room stiffly and sat down on a corn-shuck-bottomed chair . " It 's this way , Mam , " he said . " I got a wife up Nawth . I been tryin an tryin t git a furlough so I could go t scc huh . But they always put me off . So now she done worked an saved enuff money t come an see me . I wants t ax you t rent me a room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " This ai n't no hotel , son . " " I know it ai n't . I cai n't take Lily t no hotel , not lak hotels in this heah town . " " Lily yo wife ? " " Yes 'm . She my shonuff , honest t'Gawd wife . Married in th Baptist Church in Dectroit . " The fat woman sat back , and her thick lips widened into a smile . " She a good girl , ai n't she ? An you doan wanta take her t one o these heah hohouses they calls hotels . " " That 's it , Mam . " " Sho you kin bring huh heah , son . Be glad t have huh . Reveren he glad t have huh too . What yo name , son ? " " Johnny . Johnny Green . Main ? " " Yas , son ? " " You understands that I wants t come heah too ? " The fat woman rocked back in her chair and gurgled with laughter . " Bless yo heart , chile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ai n't always been th preacher 's wife neither ! " " Thank you , Mam . I got ta go , now . Time fur me t be gittin back t camp . " " When you bring Lily ? " " Be Monday night , Main . Pays you now if you wants it . " " Monday he awright . Talk it over wit th Reveren , so he make it light fur yuh . Know sodjer boys ai n't got much money . " " No Mam , sho Lawd ai n't . G night , Main . " W HEN he turned back into the main street of the Negro section , the doors of the joints were all open and the soldiers were coming out . The girls were clinging onto their arms all the way to the bus stop . Johnny looked at the dresses that stopped halfway between the pelvis and the knee and hugged the backside so that every muscle showed when they walked . He saw the purple lipstick smeared across the wide full lips , and the short hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a black lacquered cap . They went on down to the bus stop arm in arm , their knotty bare calves bunching with each step as they walked . Johnny thought about Lily . He walked past them very fast without turning his head . But just as he reached the bus stop he heard the whistles . When he turned around he saw the four MP 's and the civilian policemen stopping the crowd . He turned around again and walked back until he was standing just behind the white men . " Aw right , " the MP 's were saying , " you gals git your health cards out . " Some of the girls started digging in their handbags . Johnny could see them dragging out small yellow cardboard squares . But the others just stood there with blank expressions on their faces . The soldiers started muttering , a dark , deep-throated sound . The MP 's started pushing their way through the crowd , looking at each girl 's card as they passed . When they came to a girl who did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Aw right , Mister , take A'nt Jemima for a little ride . " Then the city policemen would lead the girl away and put her in the Black Maria . They kept this up until they had examined every girl except one . Shc hung back beside her soldier , and the first time the MP 's did n't see her . When they came back through , one of them caught her by the arm . " Lemme see your card , Mandy , " he said . The girl looked at him , her little eyes narrowing into slits in her black face . " Tek yo han offn me , white man , " she said . The MP 's face crimsoned , so that Johnny could see it , even in the darkness . " Listen , black gal , " he said , " I told you to lemme see your card . " " An I tole you t tek yo han offen me , white man ! " " Gawddammit , you little black bitch , you better do like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened after that . There was a sudden explosion of motion , and then the MP was trying to jerk his hand back , but he could n't , for the little old black girl had it between her teeth and was biting it to the bone . He drew his other hand back , and slapped her across the face so hard that it sounded like a pistol shot . She went over backwards and her tight skirt split , so that when she got up Johnny could see that she did n't have anything on under it . She came forward like a cat , her nails bared , straight for the MP 's eyes . He slapped her down again , but the soldiers surged forward all at once . The MP 's fell back and drew their guns and one of them blew a whistle . Johnny , who was behind them , decided it was time for him to get out of there and he did ; but not before he saw the squads of white MP 's hurling around the corner and going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bus stop , and swung on board . The minute after he had pushed his way to the back behind all the white soldiers , he heard the shots . The bus driver put the bus in gear and they roared off toward the camp . It was after one o'clock when all the soldiers straggled in . Those of them who could still walk . Eight of them came in on the meat wagon , three with gunshot wounds . The Colonel declared the town out of bounds for all Negro soldiers for a month . AMMIT , " Johnny said , " I got ta go meet Lily , I got ta . I cai n't stay heah . I cai n't ! " " Whatcha gon na do , " Little Willie asked , " go AWOL ? " . Johnny looked at him , his brow furrowed into a frown . " Naw , " he said , " I 'm gon na go see th Colonel ! " " Whut ! Man , you crazy ! Colonel kick yo black ass out fo you gits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that . " He walked over to the little half-mirror on the wall of the barracks . Carefully he readjusted his cap . He pulled his tie out of his shirt front , and drew the knot tighter around his throat . Then he tucked the ends back in at just the right fraction of an inch between the correct pair of buttons . He bent down and dusted his shoes again , although they were already spotless . " Man , " Little Willie said , " you sho is a fool ! " " Reckon I am , " Johnny said ; then he went out of the door and down the short wooden steps . When he got to the road that divided the colored and white sections of the camp , his steps faltered . He stood still aminute , drew in a deep breath , and marched very stiffly and erect across the road . The white soldiers gazed at him curiously , but none of them said anything . If a black soldier came over into their section it was because somebody sent him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colonel 's headquarters he stopped . He knew what he had to say , but his breath was very short in his throat and he was going to have a hard time saying it . " Whatcha want , soldier ? " the sentry demanded . " I wants t see th Colonel . " " Who sent you ? " Johnny drew his breath in sharply . " I ai n't at liberty t say , " he declared , his breath coming out very fast behincl.qhe words . " You ai n't at liberty t say , " the sentry mimicked . " Well I 'll be damned ! If you ai n't at liberty t say , then I ai n't at liberty t let you see th Colonel ! Git tha hell outa here , nigger , before I pump some lead in you ! " Johnny did n't move . The sentry started toward him , lifting his rifle butt , but another soldier , a sergeant , came around the corner of the building . " Hold on there , " he called . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This here nigger says he wants t see tha Colonel an when I ast him who sent him , he says he ai n't at liberty t say ! " The Sergeant turned to Johnny . Johnny came to attention and saluted him . You are n't supposed to salute NCO 's , but sometimes it helps . " What you got t say fur yourself , boy ? " the Sergeant said , not unkindly . Johnny 's breath evened . " I got uh message fur th Colonel , suh , " he said ; " I ai n't sposed t give it t nobody else but him . I ai n't even sposed t tell who sont it , suh . " The Sergeant peered at him sharply . " You tellin tha truth , boy ? " " Yassuh ! " " Awright . Wait here a minute . " He went into HQ . ' After a couple of minutes he came back out . " Awright , soldier , you kin go on in . " Johnny mounted the steps and went into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white-haired soldier with a face tanned to the color of saddle leather . He was reading a letter through a pair of horn-rimmed glasses which had only one ear-hook left , so that he had to hold them up to his eyes with his hand . He put them down and looked up . Johnny saw that his eyes were pale blue , so pale that he felt like he was looking into the eyes of an eagle or some other fierce bird of prey . " Well ? " he said , and Johnny stiffened into a salute . The Colonel half smiled . " At ease , soldier , " he said . Then : " The Sergeant tells me that you have a very important message for me . " Johnny gulped in the air . " Beggin th Sergeant 's pardon , suh , " he said , " but that ai n't so . " " What ! " " Yassuh , " Johnny rushed on , " nobody sent me . I cone on m own hook . I had t talk t yuh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard house afterwards , but please suh lissen t me fur jes a minute ! " The Colonel relaxed slowly . Something very like a smile was playing around the corners of his mouth . He looked at his watch . " All right , soldier , " he said , " you 've got five minutes . " " Thank yuh , thank yuh , suh ! " " Speak your piece , soldier ; you 're wasting time ! " " It 's about Lily , suh . She my wife . She done worked an slaved fur nigh onto six months t git the money t come an see me . An now you give th order that none o th cullud boys kin go t town . Beggin yo pandon , suh , I was n't in none o that trouble . I ai n't never been in no trouble . You kin ax my capn , if you wants to . All I wants is permission to go into town fur one week , an I 'll stay outa town fur two months if yuh wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ring Captain Walters for me , " he said ; then , " What 's your name , soldier ? " " It 's Green , suh . Private Johnny Green . " " Captain Walters ? This is Colonel Milton . Do you have anything in your files concerning Private Johnny Green ? Oh yes , go ahead . Take all the time you need . " The Colonel lit a long , black cigar . Johnny waited . The clock on the wall spun its electric arms . " What 's that ? Yes . Yes , yes , I see . Thank you , Captain . " He put down the phone and picked up a fountain pen . He wrote swiftly . Finally he straightened up and gave Johnny the slip of paper . Johnny read it . It said : " Private Johnny Green is given express permission to go into town every evening of the week beginning August seventh and ending August fourteenth . He is further permitted to remain in town overnight every night during said week , so long as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of the Commanding Officer , Colonel H. H. Milton . " There was a hard knot at the base of Johnny 's throat . He could n't breathe . But he snapped to attention , and saluted smartly . " Thank you , suh , " he said at Last , then : " Gawd bless you , suh ! " " Forget it , soldier . I was a young married man once myself . My compliments to Captain Walters . " Johnny saluted again and about-faced , then he marched out of the office and down the stairs . On the way back he saluted everybody  --  privates , NCO 's , and civilian visitors , his white teeth gleaming in a huge smile . " That 's sure one happy darky , " one of the white soldiers said . 01INNY stood in the station and watched the train running in . The yellowlights . ) , from the windows flickered on and off across his face as the alternating squares of light and darkness flashed past . Then it was slowing and Johnny was running beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coach . He could see her standing up , holding her bags . She came down the steps the first one and they stood there holding each other , Johnny 's arms crushing all the breath out of her , holding her so hard against him that his brass buttons hurt through her thin dress . She opened her mouth to speak but he kissed her , bending her head backward on her neck until her little hat fell off . It lay there on the ground , unnoticed . " Sugah , " she said , " sugah . It was awful . " " I know , " he said , " I know . " Then he took her bags and they started walking out of the station toward the Negro section of town . " I missed yuh so much , " Johnny said , " I thought I lose m mind ! ' " Me too , " she said . Then : " I brought th marriage license with me like yuh tole me . I doan want th preacher 's wife t think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see yuh uh angel ! " They went very quietly through all the dark streets and the white soldiers turned to look at Johnny and his girl . Lak a queen , Johnny thought , lak a queen . He looked at the girl beside him , seeing the velvety nightshade skin , the glossy black lacquered curls , the sweet wide hips and the long , clean legs , striding beside him in the darkness . Behold I am black but comely , oh ye daughters of Zion ! They turned into the Bottom where the street lights were dim blobs on the pine poles and the dust rose up in little swirls around their feet . Johnny had his head half turned so that he did n't see the two MP 's until he had almost bumped into them . He dropped one bag and caught Lily by the arm . Then he drew her aside quickly and the two men went by them without speaking . They kept on walking , but every two steps Johnny would jerk his head around and look nervously back over his shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stopped and were looking back at them . Johnny turned out the elbow of the arm next to Lily so that it hooked into hers a little and began to walk faster , pushing her along with him . " Whas yo hurry , sugah ? " she said . " I be heah a whole week ! " But Johnny was looking over his shoulder at the two MP 's . They were coming toward them now , walking with long , slow strides , their reddish-white faces set . Johnny started to push Lily along faster , but she shook off his arm and stopped still . " I do declare , Johnny Green ! You th beatiness man ! Whut you walk me so fas fur ? " Johnny opened his mouth to answer her , but the military police were just behind them now , and the Sergeant reached out and laid his hand on her arm . " Cmon gal , " he said , ' lemme see it . " " Let you see whut ? Whut he mean , Johnny ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see your card . " " My card ? " Lily said blankly . " Whut kinda card , Mister ? " Johnny put the bags down . He was fighting for breath . " Look heah , Sarge , " he said ; " this girl my wife ! " " Oh yeah ? I said lemme see your card , sister ! " " I ai n't got no card , Mister . 1 du n no whut you talkin bout . " " Look , Sarge , " the other MP said , " th soldier 's got bags . Maybe she 's just come t town . " " These your bags , gal ? " " Yessir . " " Awright . You got twenty-four hours to git yourself a health card . If you do n't have it by then , we hafta run you in . Git goin , now . " " Listen , " Johnny shouted ; " this girl my wife ! She ai n't no ho 1 I tell you she ai n't ? " " What you say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ? ' ! He started toward Johnny . Lily swung on Johnny 's arm . " Cmon , Johnny , " she said ; " they got guns . Cmon Johnny , please ! Please , Johnny ! " Slowly she drew him away . " Aw , leave em be , Sarge , " the MP Corporal said , " maybe she is his wife . " The Sergeant spat . The brown tobacco juice splashed in the dirt not an inch from Lily 's foot . Then the two of them turned and started away . Johnny stopped . " Lemme go , Lily , " he said , " lemme go ! " He tore her arm loose from his and started back up the street . Lily leaped , her two arms fastening themselves around his neck . He fought silently but she clung to him , doubling her knees so that all her weight was hanging from his neck . " No , Johnny ! Oh Jesus no ! You be kilt ! Oh , Johnny , listen t me , sugah ! You 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break her grip but she swung her weight sidewise and the two of them went down in the dirt . The MP 's turned the corner out of sight . Johnny sat there in the dust staring at her . The dirt had ruined her dress . He sat there a long time looking at her until the hot tears rose up back of his eyelids faster than he could blink them away , so he put his face down in her lap and cried . " I ai n't no man ! " he said , " I ai n't no man ! " " Hush , sugah , " she said . " You 's a man awright . You 's my man ! " Gently she drew him to his feet . He picked up the bags and the two of them went down the dark street toward the preacher 's house . Cultural Utopia rpHE most literate country in the world is a very small one , with only 1 3 0,000 people  --  about as many as there are in Chattanooga , Tennessee , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small country publish over 100 newspapers and magazines , but it publishes far more books , in relation to its population , than any other country-40 times as many as does the United States , for example . In addition to these books in the native language , there is also a wide sale for foreign works ; three-quarters of the people are bilingual and about one-fifth are trilingual . And the country has over 70 book dealers . ( Chicago , to be as well supplied with book dealers per capita , would need to have 1,829 of them ! ) It has its own university , its own symphony orchestra , a number of fine choral societies , and various amateur theatrical groups which produce locally written dramas and musical comedies as well as plays in translation . Its artists command a ready market , for the fashion is to buy contemporary paintings and put them on one 's walls ; most houses contain at least one picture by a local artist . Nor do the artists need to depend wholly on such sales for a living , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as writers and composers ) , makes special grants yearly to others , and has purchased some 300 works of contemporary art . And the fines levied for infringements of the liquor laws go to a Cultural Fund used to buy pictures , to promote research , or to publish good books at low cost . If you do n't already know the name of this actual country , you will find it in the Personal and Otherwise department . From data 4 , , p-plied by Harvey H. Arnason
