" Let 's keep out of America 's and Russia 's quarrels ! " <P> More &; more Europeans are saying that these days . It might come as a shock to onetime isolationists in Osakis , Minn , and Kokomo , Ind . to hear such close approximations from the Continent of their 1915 and 1940 arguments . <P> Most intelligent Europeans know quite well that they could not stand aside in event of a Russian-U . S. struggle , but they have suffered so much that fear overcomes reason . Unlike the U.S. 's old isolationism , the new European brand does not spring from a sense of security , but from an overwhelming knowledge of insecurity . Britain 's R. H. S. Grossman , a leader of the dissident Laborites , put it thus : " Europe has become a relatively unimportant place . . . where the atom bombs meant to fall on America will fall short on Britain . . . . This country is now indefensible in a war between Russia and America . If we join Russia against America we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Americans against Russia , we are a little island 3,000 miles from our ally . . . . The only thing to do is to stand apart . . . . " <P> First Cossacks , then Negroes . Frenchmen are so tired of conflict that even conservative De Gaulle talks of making France a balance between the U.S. and Russia . Said Marc Leroy , a bank clerk : " What a pity we can not transport France to some place which is not in the middle . I would choose America . But , " he added hastily , " I do not want to choose . " <P> Italians feel even more strongly . Said Socialist Pietro Nenni last week : " We have n't any colonies nor navy nor army nor territorial ambitions . We are today 's arch-isolationists . " However , unlike old-line U.S. isolationists , Europeans could not afford to say " Let them fight it out among themselves . " Even a devout Communist forgot himself sufficiently to tell a TIME correspondent last week : " A conflict between you and Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by both of you , first by the Cossacks , then by Negroes . " <P> Last week , visiting Midwesterner Henry Wallace- " a child in a terrible dark , " as the London Daily Mail put it-was exploiting ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) Europe 's frightened , unreasoning and very natural desire to stay away from the fire . <P> Osakis and Kokomo , which had learned the lesson of one world , were getting quite a lesson in isolationism.
