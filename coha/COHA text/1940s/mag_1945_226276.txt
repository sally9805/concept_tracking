By an overwhelming vote ( 949-to-34 ) , but with considerable reluctance , the Associated Press last week finally took in Marshall Field 's Chicago Sun . Nobody sang For He 's a Jolly Good Fellow . It was not that kind of an occasion . <P> The A.P . members felt put upon , and did n't care if they showed it . The Justice Department had first twisted A.P . ' s arm with an antitrust suit ; then in June the Supreme Court had twisted it even further . Said the Court sternly : nobody must be denied A.P . membership just because a local rival fears the competition . <P> It was the Chicago Tribune 's newsprint Napoleon , Colonel Robert R. McCormick , who had done most to blackball Marshall Field 's rival Sun three and a half years ago , when the A.P . turned Field down , more than 2-to-1 . Last week it was Colonel McCormick who did most to get Field in. * Bertie McCormick made it clear he was lumping it , but not liking it : <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack upon the Associated Press did not originate with him , but with the Department of Justice ... I was determined to resist what I considered coercion ... I was visited by FBI agents and threatened at a meeting probably such as the FBI-Gestapo never had before . . . . " At long last , the Colonel had hauled down his flag , hollered uncle , and surrendered , keeping his sidearms . <P> Asked a member from Somerset , Pa. : could n't we ding Marshall Field for some other reason than the effect of competition ? Replied an A.P . lawyer : it was a little late to think up new reasons . Member McCormick summed it up : " The Court will hold us in contempt if we do n't elect the " applicants . Therefore . I second the motion . " <P> <P> *Along with three other papers whose editorial policy suits the Colonel 's liver better : Hearst 's Detroit Times and Oakland Post-Enquirer ; Cousin Eleanor Medill ( " Cissy " ) Patterson 's Washington Times-Herald.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
