shikari took over the roped goat . Then the path narrowed to a faint track and the forest closed around them . They watched the tree branches and when they stopped to listen to a sudden rustle the Englishman tautened and gripped his weapon with both hands . Later , it began to drizzle and the goat bleated and fought the rope . They crossed a clearing and he could see the way they had come ; he found the clouds had broken in the south ; it was a long time since the last rumble of thunder had rolled down the mountain . Then the shikari stopped and they chose a patch of grass overlooked from the slope , and driving a peg into the ground the Indian tied the goat to it ; he gave the animal sufficient rope to set him off against the dark undergrowth . They withdrew , found a forked tree , and climbed into it . Toward two o'clock the goat , frightened , began bleating again . Trust the goat , the Englishman thought . The drizzle had stopped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tree . " He is coming , huzoor . " They saw the goat tug and stand erect alternately , and they knew that the animal was right even if they might be mistaken . He raised the gun , conscious of the sudden rush of blood in his ears ; quietly slipped the safety off and listened , in tense mouth-drying concentration , for the crackle of brushwood . When it came it seemed to be behind the goat . He felt the Indian 's hand on his shoulder and followed the direction of his finger , and he saw murky bush on the fringe of the glade and then the bush came apart and the panther stood on the grass . He made no sound , but the red of his mouth showed in quick spasms . The goat retreated stiffly and the shikari whispered , " Now . " Still fascinated , he took aim and fired ; the panther grabbed the air and toppled over , while the forest shook in an earthquake of crashing trees and reverberations . For an indefinite time he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Got him , huzoor ! " and his breath came back and at once the drununing in his temples abated . " Good shot , huzoor , but we must wait . " After ten minutes the goat recovered , and they slipped to the ground and cut a young tree . They whittled it clean and tied the panther 's front paws around the thicker end and the hind ones at the thin end ; they tucked its long tail between its legs to prevent it from dragging . The shikari loosened the goat 's rope and bound it to his waist . Then , lifting the bar to their shoulders and padding it with gunny , they began walking back . They met the woodchopper , who had heard the shot and come up to help . From there , the two Indians carried the bar and the Englishman led the goat . The way to the house seemed shorter . He walked up to the veranda proud and a little self-conscious . " What will you do with it ? " she asked . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , and ask the divisional officer to skin it for me . If he is n't eight feet from tail to whiskers I 'll eat my topee . " She came down the steps and prodded the panther with her stick . " Should n't we go , Peter ? Jaloo thinks it might get dark sooner now that it 's cloudy . " " All right , let me eat something first . " A TER he had washed and eaten he felt fine ; the men had by then slung the panther over a pony. " / 'd like to ride for the rest of the day , " she said , " Will you take my dandy ? " " I feel like walking some more , " he said . " Do n't ride without a cushion ; these arc very small saddles . " She mounted the pony and they passed down into the narrow gorge that led the stream east . The coolies swung the empty dandy and took things easy , and the smell of their hookas mixed with that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on both sides they saw the tea-gardens on the other mountains . The stream became a river . Then the sun reappeared and the shadows blued more deeply , and the oblique light picked out the watered rice-fields and corrugated iron roofing , painted bright red and green . At the dak bungalow the chowkidar and his wife came to meet them . They washed and sat down on the front porch . As the sun sank the entire valley came into clear-cut relief . Later , he went to the village and saw the district officer about the skin and when he returned it was dark and the food was ready . They had a large meal of meat and fresh vegetables , and then she creamed her face and went to bed . They discussed the day 's march and the midday shoot and she made him promise they would not rise before the sun was up the next day . Outside , the low singing of the coolies grew indistinct from the baying of donkeys , and once or twice a jackal howled above the bungalow . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice of the valley away east . Second Day MHE PONY-MEN had piled the luggage on I the porch and were drinking their cha . The valley 's awakening had become a mounting clamor . He took a cigarette and narrowed his eyes toward Nepal . The violet ranges had already begun to shimmer . He remembered her face , turned to the wall , pallid under the layer of cream , the kind of face that came from indigestion and bad dreams ; he had looked at it , fascinated at first but later unseeing , and though the face was still there he saw another one . the one he wanted to see , but it was already far and undefined , and the only sensation it gave him was that of something important missing . He thought of the Heat once more . Astonishing how one came to it again and again . The Heat was the Main Theme throughout , with a character and behavior of its own . And he thought of that night four years ago : " Do n't touch me , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspired for years , it was accepted like sleeping or drinking and doctors said it was normal ; so you were never quite conscious of it until she said , " Is it worth the trouble , dear ? You 're soaking wet as it is . " Quietly , you put it down to whatever came to your mind , strangeness , reserve , discomfort , but never took it in hand because you knew not how . What was the use , you said ; being rational about it was an embarrassing business ; you too had joked about Somerset Maugham 's Elements and the tropical passions running amuck ; you hated fussiness and stopped discussing it ; why make it worse ? And you carried it in you , which was n't constructive either because the Heat remained throughout , impish and malicious , whatever you thought or said or refrained from saying ; and a time came when you were unable to distinguish it from other trouble , and the more you tried the harder you hurt yourself . Where was the energy ? you said ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Let 's go to the club before I choke , " you went ; what was unreasonable about that ? And you sipped your gin and bitters and discussed the latest film outrage or the dog-show at Simla or Poona , and time flowed between rounds of drink , reminding you of the cook at home , and you got up again and drove back , all the way to the starting point , only there was acceptance in it now . No one else seemed to have a better formula . Tomorrow the paper might write about a revolution in Peru , now that would be something ; or you might send a letter to the editor about the mail delays , or hear another one about the young Parsee sailing to Europe for the first time ; always anything but you and she ; that was the point , you made it into a fine art and you practiced it continuously . And now you were on holiday and alone ; where did it all go ? There was so much you wanted to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wanted it to stay put , and every day you said , A la manana , but it went somehow , smooth and crafty , you could n't hold it . This was n't the office , you said , you made no laws here . He returned to the house and found her dressed . Under the two patches of rouge below her temples the blue tiredness still showed . When they came out of the bungalow grounds it was already half-past eight . The village children shouted Salaam and women stood at the small windows and giggled ; they were fair and good-looking , with big , rosy cheekbones and smiling eyes . The sub-divisional officer was at the gate of his garden waving them goodbye . He was a small , delicate Brahman . The intonation of the coolies ' chatter took on some of the rhythm of their pace ; they moved in regular spurts and their voices rose and fell with the ground . He prodded his animal and came nearer . " They do talk , do n't they ? " " Can they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these faces and this hair . " " The dirt is only a difference of standard , Ann . What matters is that they are kind and that they sing and laugh in spite of the dirt . " " It 's always the same , they eat with their fingers . I could n't have kindness interfering with my stomach . " " I think you 're just making it harder for yourself . Your life is here and you might as well make it pleasant . I do n't think you 've ever tried . When we are where we are , only you and I can make the mistakes , not they . I wish you could see that . " " Do n't talk rot , please . " Now , he thought , it could have sounded convincing , why did n't it ? But the rise in the path made the talking difficult . The men had stopped singing ; they were watching the ground for fine-cut slabs of flint . As the sun rose the whiteness of the path pained their eyes ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare one around . Every time they reached a new turn in the path the solitary tree on the ridge seemed a little nearer , and he was glad to think of it and imagine that life went up to it and not further . Back of that saddle and that tree , he thought , may be another opportunity ; should n't I think of it ? He found he did n't . Instead , he thought of the Mutiny Museum in that large fort , and saw her walking from etching to etching , forgetful of his presence , her forehead wrinkled ; and he remembered thinking , " It 's the wrong beginning , " and taking her arm and saying , " Let 's go back " ? as if avoiding it was any cleverer . But she would n't stop before she 'd seen all the pictures . The art of etching was n't high at the time of the Mutiny , and there was one of a sepoy holding a white child turkey-wise , before a white woman kneeling in a litter of gory clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daggers , against a back-ground of burning houses and ransacked furniture ; the picture was awfully lurid and sensational , it had no right to be there except as an instrument of self-acquittal ; there 'll always be those without understanding but with the need to articulate it And then her mouth hardened , worse than he expected ; she was new and impressionable then . A terrible mistake of course , life was more than the Calcutta Hole or the Midnapore shootings , and Fe-fi-fo-furn was only a line of emotional poetry ; where was the point ? and you decided there was none . That was simple enough . Where were the simple words to give  --  it meaning ? N ILE from the saddle the coolies stopped in a small gully ; they perspired heavily . Standing on his feet he felt the heat of the rock around his head like a hot dry towel . The breeze had ceased completely . The part of the valley visible from the defile lay remote in the haze . She took off her shoes and looked at the blisters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in the first place . Look at them now . " He drank the water which Jaloo gave him and said , " I told you to take a pair of walking shoes . " " You also said " We are , Ann . away and we 've twenty-second . " " You 're your own manager , are n't you ? " " They 're expecting me ; I left a lot of work behind , you know that . " " That 's not a valid reason , Peter . No filthy Marwari could push me around like that , I assure you . The first fortnight in four years  --  and you 're glad of it . For heaven 's sake , what can you show for it ? " " I 've got work to do . It 's got to be seen to by somebody . " " But it 's always you . Thompson gets a month every year and I know dozens who get that . You 're the only exploited lamb . " " Should we talk about it , Ann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 's all that matters . And when you become too expensive they 'll get somebody new on the basic salary . " " There 'll be something else then . " The unhappiness returned . He looked at her and saw a stranger with familiar features , and he saw the boat come alongside , and the white figure on deck B and a white handkerchief in the air above the figure , but it was like looking at a snapshot in an old album ; the picture was there , but you only saw the old-fashioned dress and the stiff pose . " It 's time you look around and decide , " she said . IIer voice was calm now . She put her shoes on and laced them . " I am no longer young nor are you . Have you thought of that ? " " Go ahead , " he said . " I 've been here four years and you seven . You 've had one home leave and you ca n't be sure of getting another . I look at myself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line around the mouth and I know my complexion is awful . Every morning I stand before the mirror and want to cry because there 's nothing I can do about it . " " We all age , " he said . " Women think about it more , that 's all . " " Try to sec my point , Peter . Have you watched the faces of these women ? You might try once . I simply have n't got the courage to go through with it . If I think I 'll never leave I should go crazy . Can you understand that ? " " Yes , " he said . He thought of the humid nights and the way perspiration tickled his ribs . They said every man bathing in the river had fungus in his ears . In the last analysis , one never got away without paying anything at all . " I ca n't leave now . Apart from everything else , the war 's still on . " " But you can make up your mind , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference . But you 've got to make up your mind right now . I wo n't stay a day longer . " " I have n't got the money yet . " " You 'll have no more in five years . How can you fool yourself so long ? " " You wanted it straight , Ann . I do n't think I want to leave . " In the silence that followed , he watched the valley and the range of mountains and he traced the course of the river that glimmered through the valley until it gotto the foot of the hills . The heat was unusual for that altitude . A shower was in the offing . Perhaps . " Is that final ? " she said . " I think so . " She rose and stood before him slender and shadowy against the blue immensity . Her dark glasses looked down on him . She seemed to stand there like someone before departure and he suddenly realized that for a long time he had done nothing to keep the two sides from ripping wider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " After four years of doubt I am convinced of it . " Her outline grew softer in the gathering haze and he found it easier to watch her than to think . " Remember I warned you , " she said . He rose too and looked towards the saddle . The first white cloud , blown from the nothingness behind the ridge , framed the solitary tree like a halo . It swelled fast , dwarfing the tree . It filled the immersion of the saddle and its edges grew ragged and each little bulge swelled into a big bulge and then each of them became a separate cloud , swelling independently , poised over the ridge like Leghorns . He saw that their bottoms were gray and pregnant . Third Day Hav stopped at the Lohaghat dak- bungalow that night , on the fringe of a tall deodar wood , and she told him she would n't go further . They lay on hard camp-cots before a fire and heard the wind in the chimneys . She was unexcited and he saw that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to lie beside her he was n't sure what made him do it , but she was small and brittle in his hands and bent to his pressure without thinking , and he softened and felt generous . " Let 's not fight . There 's nobody but us . " " I do n't want to fight , Peter . You make me . " " It 's hell having a stranger around . Pm not that kind of man . " Even while he said it he knew it was n't always true . Now she was confused and the satin gown was smooth and good to the touch , and being emotional and a fool was almost satisfying . " We must stick it out a little longer ! ! " How much longer ? I am tired . " He had n't seriously thought about it , but it seemed to make little difference . " A year or two , " he said . " There 's a lot we have n't done yet . " She came back then and he sensed the change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Peter . " " I know . It 's hell . " " I did n't want you near for ages . Why was that ? " " Let 's try again , " he said . " Christ , there must be other things . " The first year was now near , assembling the loose ends into a strong cord . He stopped thinking of himself as a liar . " Is there anything ? " " There must be . " " I do n't know what it is . I do n't want to be old at thirty-five . " " Try to forget that , ca n't you ? " " I can be weeks without you and never notice . I did n't think it 'd be like that . " " It 's all right now , darling . " " I 'm not sure . " " For God 's sake , Ann , I ca n't help you if you do n't try . " It was one way of pinning down all that nearness and warmth , of stepping out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it roughly and hurriedly , with the cool thought that it was probably the last time and he would either carry it off or lose all nerve forever . They stayed awake late and he talked her out of staying at Lohaghat and promised they would go slowly . He heard her mention home and talk of the future , and then he thought : A home is where all of you is in one piece and nothing essential is missing . MHEY rose at nine the next morning , 1 and began the slow climb to the Abbot Mount ridge . Already the range was piled up with clouds that looked increasingly baggy and rose with little volcanic bubbles . The north was a horizontal tricolor of green , white , and blue , and as they went toward it the blue stripe narrowed and the whitemounted higher . Once more the abdomens of the separate formations were gray and roundly weighted . They had not yet seen the snows . Reaching the top of the saddle yesterday they had found the open space between the saddle and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immediate views appeared distant through the haze . He had ridden up to the saddle in excitement and the disappointment was hard to bear . Four days of trek seemed an awfully long build-up for the brief moment of disappointment . And now he thought : Will this one be the same as yesterday ? Nothing was ever good without a little luck . There were white houses on top of the Mount , their red roofs sharply defined against the green mountain . Higher up , the mountain 's edge was clear-cut against the white-gray mass of clouds . To the left were the unbroken ranges of Almora ; he tried to count them . The sixth was already a part of the mist . Beyond it Almora , the base of the last expedition to Nanda Devi . Jaloo came up and his face was anxious . " Plenty rain , huzoor . Also plenty wind . " He remembered the maps he had borrowed from Fox and all the snapshots he had seen in the last six months and he found that memorizing the peaks and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if I do n't see them ? he thought . " Another fifteen minutes , " he called out to her . He could kick himself for the stiffness with which he said it . " I 've been thinking , Peter , " she said . " This is really no fun . I 'd be much happier somewhere in a chair . You could leave me here and go on alone . Do n't let me spoil it for you . " He could n't think of anything to say . He thought of last night ; the three hours now stood apart , vivid and good but of a different family from the rest ; and he knew that that was the result of trying to hit out of the circle in which you moved , because it was clear you never came out of it , you just hit at it and chipped yourself and the chips lay about you for all the time after , isolated and ends in themselves . On the ridge , they came up against a wall of clouds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fore-mountain were ripping it open , and through the rippings they could see the terraced rice fields in the valley below . The water in some of them made white stains against the field ribbing . The wind brought up sounds of dogs and bells ; it rushed up suddenly and skimmed the saddle , gathering dust and dry leaves . They dismounted and sat down on the grass . She avoided looking at him as she said : " To think that we could have gone to Naini for ten days . " " If it breaks today it 'll clear tomorrow , " he said . " Let 's not start that again . " She put on her tweed jacket and pressed the collar around her neck . " Let 's be reasonable . We can still have five days at Naini . I want a hot bath and a real bed . I do n't want rain and fog . " " There 's a risk in everything . " He felt the weariness come over him like a temperature . " We can wait until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am going down tomorrow , Peter . " " All right , " he said . He looked at the wall of clouds and wanted to walk through it and come out on the other side and face the white pinnacle of Nanda Devi . He thought of the other peaks and the open space around them and then he thought that returning to the plains would be like sleeping in a hotel room in which somebody had died the previous night . MHEY rose and he helped her into the 1 dandy . As they went along the bulging slope , there were no trees , only low bush and boulders . Kites surged up with the wind and their call sounded like the call of the partridges . They marched for an hour and a half and then the sun vanished for the day and the landscape crinkled up grayly . The thunder came nearer and from time to time the lightning lit up their faces greenish violet . Streaks of fast-traveling fog stuck to boulders until the wind ginned them to little particles . The end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This storm , huzoor , " Jaloo said . " Last days very hot . " " Get to the village before ? " he asked him . " Maybe . huzoor . Two miles . " " All right , Jaloo . Tell them to go faster . " He found the raincoats and helped her into one . For a while they trotted along glancing over their shoulders , putting their hands out for the first drops , but the storm beat them to the village . The rain began to fall heavy and pebble-like , it thickened into long , slashing sticks of water that sent the small stones flying on the ground . The flashes quickened too and their noise echoed as though space itself had suddenly been shut in , and the world became a shriveled patch of mountain , fifty yards square , still growing smaller and lonesomer . He rode to the wet dandy and poked his stick into her arm . " Chin up , old girl . " The sting of the rain increased . The dandy and the luggage smoked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent forward . He knew then that the storm was not an ordinary one . He tried to think of the village and the banya 's house , but all he could think of was his luck . Then he checked himself . He pushed against the wind now coming straight at him , and muffled the crash of thunder by sticking his chin into his chest , and he wondered what the coolies were saying to the animals . At last the leading coolie shouted back , and looking in the direction of his hand he saw a but on the horizontal ledge above the path . They climbed up and went in . There was a lean-to in the rear of the but where it almost touched the slope , and the coolies crept into it on their knees . The pony-men took the suitcases into the but and tied the animals to the poles of the lean-to . There was a large bunk in one corner , a table and two broken chairs in the other . The single window faced south but the shutter would n't close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cocoa thermos-flask . " Thank God for making the British sportsmen before anything else , " he said to her . She had taken off her raincoat and changed into a dry blouse and cardigan . She wiped her face with a towel and creamed it . The rain now pounded the roof and the wind , rushing over the but in Iong shrill whines , beat in between the corrugated sheets , and forced some of the atomized spray through the eaves . When the lightning struck it made the twilight of the room and their faces greenly luminous . " That 's that , " he said . He saw her take out a cigarette ; her fingers trembled . He wanted to be sorry , but he was only tired and mad and it took him all his strength to hold himself back . " You wanted wide open spaces , " she said , " Are n't they giving us all they have ? " He kept quiet . " You did n't need the hotels and the cars . You did n't need a roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me if it could have been different . " " It may be over by this evening . " " Let 's he optimists , too . " " This wo n't help you , Ann . Come off it . " " Let 's be strong and silent . We love the great outdoors . " " Oh shut up . " She heeled around , went to the bunk and sat down hard . " All right , go ahead and be a beast , " she said . They sat in the diminishing dusk and smoked cigarette after cigarette , with the gravel rolling on the slope outside . Then the grating became scraping ; the single stone had become an avalanche . When the thunder hit the boulders above them the planks on the floor rattled . Shc lay down and pulled the blankets over her head . At five , Jaloo told him the men refused to go until the wind abated . " Plenty stone flying , huzoor , " he said . The men brought in the rest of the luggage . He told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " I have no hand in this . " He had been turning the idea over in his mind for the last half hour and wanted to be fair . " The village is not far . It 's up to you . I wo n't mind going or staying . " " In this weather ? " " It may last all night . " " Then I 'll stay here all night . " " You wo n't like it , Ann . We can always return if it 's no go . " " I am not going to move . " " All right , but do n't blame me afterwards . " Always he was able to see it well ahead , hours and days , as if someone had mapped it all out on the table , complete with the pattern and the main episodes , but thinking about it never got him anywhere , and now he no longer cared . The day darkened and dribbled out of the but altogether . The wind became a permanent howl outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the remainder out of the thermos , and then Jaloo asked if some of the men might come in for the night . They rolled themselves into their rugs on the floor , ignoring the woman , and their food-bags and wet clothes filled the room with the smell of decay ; they fell asleep quickly . The load made the cabin less buoyant in the wind . He lay beside her on the bunk , straight and stiff , listening to her cough and wondering if she was going to sleep . In the end , he could n't keep it any longer . " It does n't work , Ann , does it ? " Under the blanket all was warmth and comfort and he realized how tired he was . " Do n't tell me , " she said " Let me guess . " He drew the blanket tighter . " I think you should know , " he said , " that I ca n't go back . I have thought about it very often but it 's never any different . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people you were working for . I still hear it said that Europeans preferred to starve at home than slave like you . " " If there 's anything to say , Ann , you might as well say it sensibly . I have no home , that 's all . It 's different for you . " " Well ? " " You can stay or go after the war , whichever suits you better . I 've been on the ground floor once and I do n't want to go back . I do n't ask you to understand it , but try to accept it . It 's hard to explain if you do n't feel it . " " The fraud is now too big for a single person . I 've always wanted to go back and made no bones about it . ro-t are the cheater . " " Do n't talk foolishly ! ' " And do n't you be abusive . Do you think that saying ' Go home ' makes everything dandy ? You ca n't bog me down in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years are over ! ' " Look , Ann , " he said with an effort . " I want to make it painless . I 'll do anything you want me to but this kind of thing makes me want to go around and murder people . Is that honest enough ? " " I 'll make you pay for all these years . " " All right , but decide one way or the other . " After that his head lightened . He remembered wondering whether you could really end things by talking . " I am sorry for everything , " he said . He meant it . " Oh shut up and let me go to sleep . " She lay quiet against the wooden wall and only the lightning proved she was there . His talk then struck him as the talk of a man trying to prove that the bodies in the morgue are dead . " Good night , " he said at last . He drew the cover over his chin , too lazy to stretch his arm and fumble for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the night and when he woke up it was like waking from a blow on the head . His ears were still full of the crash but he was at once completely awake and what he saw registered at once . She had sat up on the bunk with the blanket around her knees , looking wild , watching the lightning come in swift flashes . The shadow behind her framed her like a ghost . When the rock exploded above the but he felt the bunk move under him . The men on the floor stirred and one of them mumbled indistinctly . " What 's the matter ? " he said . Some of the horror on her face passed over to him and he stretched his hand out and touched her shoulder . " Lie down , " he said , " do n't look at it . " But she looked at him instead and her look went past him , glassy with hysteria . " Come on , Ann , lie down . Let me help you . " " You ca n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were close at hand and parts of the slope came down in noisy avalanches , missing the but by yards . He only saw the movement of her lips and he supposed the words to be what they were . He took her shoulder and pressed it down gently . " Let me go ! " The men on the floor stirred again and Jaloo lifted himself from behind the large suitcase , then sank down again . " Lie down , do n't be a bloody fool . " " Do n't touch me , " she screamed . He pressed her down , still gently , but when he reached for the covers with his free hand she shook him off and sat up again . " Ann , for the last time , " he said . " This was your idea , " she said . " Do n't touch me or scream . " " ANN ! " When the next crash came , for a split second life was no more than a tingling in the ears and then unspeakable deafness . In the shiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limp . With his arm around her , he brought her down under his own weight . Sprawling over her and keeping out of the reach of her slashing hands , he found the end of the blanket and pulled it over her . He felt her convulse in a cramp . Then she threw her head back and caught his thumb with her teeth . The jerk of the withdrawal made him lose balance and roll over on one side . She was up before he could stop her and then she was stumbling over the sleeping men and groping for the door . " Come back , you fool ! " She opened the door and for a moment he saw her silhouetted in the green-white bleakness of the door frame . The wind rushed into the cabin and inflated the men 's blankets . His mind cleared . " Jaloo , " he shouted , " get memsahib ! " He got into his windjacket and found the torch and then pushed the servant out before him . " Get the hell out of here , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifting the mountain out of the night and the boulders grew gigantic and dwindled among shooting shadows . He cupped his hands and called out , but the voice collided with wind and returned in a swish around his neck . He went forward flashing his torch , mistaking rocks and shadows for her , and then , pushing hard against the gale , he shook the rain out of his eyes and began talking to himself . He said : " Bitch ! " several times , then drew a finger across his face and shook the water away again and again , and he picked his way around loose stone and the rain came through his windjacket and pasted the cold shirt to his chest and arms . He looked all over the slope but she was n't there . She 'll be on the path , he thought then . The fool of a woman ! He lost his balance in a small ravine and when he stopped rolling he found he was on the path . The flashing cut it clear and deep , and he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village ahead . And she wo n't even have her shoes on ! He got wetter and wetter and his matted hair flew into his eyes and made him furious . But behind the curve , on the lee side of a rock , he found her sitting on the path , holding her head in her hands . " You bloody fool , " was all he could say . He pulled her up and felt her pullover sleeves oozing water . " You want to commit suicide ? " he shouted at her . " You want to get soaked and catch a death of cold ? Do n't fight now , come on ! " When the beam of Jaloo 's torch swept them from the distance she began to struggle . " You 'll pay for every day of this ! You lousy fraud ! " " Shut up , Ann , the men arc coming . " " You cheap , lousy fraud . Take your hands off me ! " " Ann , for the last time , " he said . Jaloo 's torch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bending against the wind . She wo n't remember it , he thought . He edged himself away and slapped her with his free hand . He felt the smack of her wet skin and the head giving way , but he could n't hear the sound . His fingers , numb with cold , began to tingle . " Now will you come ! " he said . She slipped through his hold and fell . The beam of the torch painted the heap of her figure brightly . " Take her under the left arm , " he said to Jaloo . " Lift slowly . Tell the men to go hack . " She was heavy and her hair fell over her face in thick water-matted plaits . " Easy , Jaloo , " he said . Back in the hut , they laid her on the bunk . He told Jaloo to make tea and ordered the men out . He undressed her , dried her with a towel and put her in dry clothes . She came to but did n't open her eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the servant brought the tea he made her drink it . She lay back once more , without a word , and all he could see in the light of the torch which Jaloo left on the table were the tears coming out of her closed eyes , trickling down her neck , vanishing in the woolen muffler . Fourth Day W HEN Jaloo came in with the teakettle , he was a dark outline against a day of bright sunshine and a blue sky . Behind him came the voices of the coolies and pony-men . He dressed and went outside on the ledge . He drank his tea slowly and watched the snow-line rise out of the mist ; except in the south , there were no clouds and the air was crisp , and he inhaled it deeply . Look at them now , he thought . His eyes passed over the range , pausing on each separate peak , until they came to the shimmer of the Nepal ice . Yesterday , he thought , they were there too . The wall before him was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vivid . Full value for money , he thought . She can have all the luggage she wants . She can go to Simla or Naini or Ladakh , I do n't care , / can still make Pitoregarh if I hurry . They say the path goes further . He returned to the but and stood over the bunk . The sun shone straight into the cabin . " Ann , get up , " he said . With her face to the wall , she moved as in a nightmare . He knelt on the bunk and touched her forehead : it was burning . Everything happens to me , he thought . Then , as she turned on her back , he saw her flushed cheeks and the sickly blue around her eyes . Her pulse ticked fast and irregular . A sudden wave of anger took his words away , and he stood silent for a few seconds , fighting to suppress it . When the wave abated he sat on the edge of the bunk and said : " How are you feeling ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thought , the path would be lost in the first giant ravines and the air would be pure and it would smell of freshly melted ice . The ground would be clean and untrodden . " You 're going down today . " " Go away , " she said again . He left the hut , took another wet cigarette , and leaned against the corner of the box . His eyes worked their way up once more , range by range , up to the summit of the jagged line that towered above everything : Nanda Devi . Further to the right , Nandakot and Api , and farther still Simikot , pink in the distance . His eyes went back to Nanda Devi . Was n't she a beauty ! He traced the sharp , steep line of her shoulder and , climbing steadily along it , reached the conical peak . Getting there , his eyes narrowed from strain . " The magnificent cheat ! " he said aloud . Back in the hut , he found the teakettle still warm . He filled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll do you good . " He held her head and found it again limp and feverish . " There 's a doctor in Lohaghat , " he added . " You must get up now . " " Why do n't you leave me alone ? " she said . He made her get up and helped her dress . Her teeth chattered and whenshe faced him her look went through him again . And still he imagined himself going through the snow , breathing the cold atmosphere of the pink-purple pinnacles . " Better have some more tea while I pack , " he said . He helped the men with the packing and when the suitcases were locked they strapped them into harness . He padded the dandy with a blanket and put another one over the back . When she came out of the but and got into it , he wrapped her and put the topee on her head . " All right , " he said to Jaloo . " Back to Lohaghat . Let them go fast . " The coolies carried the dandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she faced the snows . Still drawing on their hookas , they climbed the first serpentine on the bare slope . Only an invisible streak of raw tobacco odor remained behind them . In the end he came down himself and followed the coolies . At the bend he stopped , turned around once more , and said quietly : " The beautiful one ! " But the sound traveled only a fraction of the distance and he had no way of telling whether she got the message . Half an hour later he was hurrying up the slope , after the dandy . The rising path brought his breath out in quick , labored gasps . He climbed with his back hunched , as if under a load , thinking hard and then giving up , coughing from too much nicotine and the chill , while the kites whizzed overhead and their brick-red flight provided the only sound beside that of his nailed shoes . Finally he forgot to turn back and make sure that the white wall was still there . BLIPS ON THE CHRISTMAS TREES BERNARD WICKSTEED F @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war was operating radar sets inside nightfighters over Britain and during the whole of that time , in fact until the war was over , I and a thousand or so like me were not allowed to breathe a word about it . We were not even allowed to intimate that such a job existed . Officially , nightfighter crews were men with eyes like cats who ate carrots to improve their night vision and wore dark glasses when they went into brightly lit rooms . Actually many of them , like myself , were astigmatic , rather fat , middle-aged men who found the British blackout just as great a trial as anyone else . We were recruited in great secrecy and trained in an old stable in Scotland . From the roof and walls spouted strange aerials and inside , the mangers had been turned into laboratory benches on which stood what was then the latest and most secret weapon of the war . We hung our coats on hooks that had once been graced by harness and saddles . After each lecture our notebooks were collected and locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed . Although this was before Pearl Harbor there were a few Americans around the place who had come to learn what the RAF knew about radar . I went into the nightfighting business with the second wave . Those who wentbefore were a hurriedly collected , mixed lot . Some were the scientists who had helped invent the stuff and then volunteered to fly with it . The others were picked up on the airfields from which the first nightfighters operated . Any likely looking erk ( enlisted ground staff ) who was keen enough to fly all night and not let it interfere with his ordinary daytime duties was given a chance . At that time no one quite knew what qualifications were needed for the job . The scientists reckoned it was very difficult and used long words which made it all sound complicated . The pilots , on the other hand , thought anybody ought to be able to do it . Just sitting in the back of an airplane twiddling a few knobs and telling the pilot to turn left or right seemed to them too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have any success was an ex-London costermonger with an enthusiastic wit and a great flow of words . He started as an AC2 ( GD ) , which means aircraftsman second class , general duties , and is generally recognized as the lowest form of human life in the RAF . The pilots , however , liked his bright cockney humor and , as he seemed to know how to work the box of tricks in the hack as well as anyone , he was encouraged . He would fly with any-Bernard Wicksteed , until the war 's end a squadron leader in the RAF , was a radar operator in England during the early experimental stages of as use body . Sometimes he went on three patrols in a night , stepping straight from one plane when it landed into another about to take off . No one took much notice of him , except the station warrant officer who complained that the man was always so sleepy during the day . In the eyes of an erk the station warrant officer is nearer to God than the C.O. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being came to him as he was sweeping out the barracks one morning and the conversation went thus : " You bin flying all night agin ? " " Yus . " " You in the aircraft that got that Hun last night ? " " Yus . " " Well , gim me that broom and I 'll finish sweeping . You ought a be asleep . " After that there was no trouble with the SWO and the cockney was able to devote all his time to flying . The squadron began to pile up successes . Several pilots had knocked down two raiders apiece and others one each and they felt pretty pleased with themselves . Then someone suddenly woke up to the fact that because he had flown with so many of the successful pilots , the erk that no one bothered about much had been in at more kills than anyone . When they checked up they found that he had helped in the destruction of five German raiders , more than twice as many as anyone else . So they gave him the Distinguished Flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medal ribbon on and went off to Whitechapel , where he was promptly arrested by the MP 's , who said : " See ' ere . Erks do n't win no D.F.M. 's . They 's for aircrew types , pilots and the like . You come along of us . " And he had to go along because the job was so secret that he could n't give a convincing explanation . Another of these early recruits , who was later in my squadron , had much the same trouble . He flew at night and drove a truck in the daytime . MP 's searching his truck found his flying boots under the seat and put him under arrest for stealing government property . They said drivers had no right to flying boots . This system of recruiting did not last long . It was hit or miss , with too manymisses . For every erk that made good there were twenty who did n't . Most of them were very bad and the pilots , clinging to the idea that knob-twiddling was child 's play , blamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose confidence in the whole idea and wanted to revert to visual methods of interception , carrots and all that . The Air Ministry held conferences on the subject and in the end decided that the scientists were right  --  the apparatus was difficult to operate and a special type of mind was needed . What type of mind that was they were not quite sure , as there had been no job like it before , but scientists had it and most erks did not . There were n't enough scientists to go round , and anyway their services were more urgently needed for developing the new applications of radar that were becoming evident every day . So the powers had to cast around in other directions , and that is how notices began to appear in the press saying that though the ordinary upper age limit for recruiting aircrew was thirty-two there were vacancies for a few men with special qualifications up to the age of forty-one . N Turap. anxiety to get the right type of I mind the Air Ministry were not fussy about what kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards were relaxed and applicants could be shortsighted , long-sighted , astigmatic , or even plain color blind . That is how I came to get into the racket . At the time I was 36 , spectacled , and soft with good living , so no other aircrew category was open to me . They sent me to be interviewed by a newly formed selection board which consisted of one flight lieutenant and his lady secretary . On the wall were a lot of charts and graphs . One was designed to show which professions provided the most suitable types for this new job . Another was to show which age groups seemed the most promising . When I called there were no entries on any of them , for the board had only just got going and had no facts as yet to work on , There was the usual form to fill in , asking for particulars of breeding and schooling and when I had completed it
