Passengers on the big old Boeing flying boat Bermuda Sky Queen began complaining almost as soon as she took off from Foynes , Eire . The Sky Queen 's owners , American-International Airways , Inc. , had provided few comforts for her nonscheduled flight to Baltimore . She carried 62 passengers and seven crew members-one of the biggest human cargoes ever crammed into a transatlantic airplane . After a night in the air , the complaints grew . The steward served nothing but orange or tomato juice for breakfast , told passengers tartly that he " had other things to do beside cook food . " <P> But a little later the Sky Queen 's people abruptly forgot the scant fare and the lack of reclining chairs . The plane was running out of gasoline . She had been airborne for 18 hours and 32 minutes on a flight which had been scheduled for 17 hours ; a night of violent headwinds had erased all chances of her reaching her first stop at Argentia , Newfoundland . <P> The Sky Queen 's captain-a boyish-looking , 33-year-old ex-U.S . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he still had gasoline for almost three hours ' flight , he doubled back toward the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Bibb , which " was on station as a weather ship about 900 miles northeast of Newfoundland . He found her , with fuel to spare . But as the plane settled lower , the tense and silent passengers saw a fearsome sight . The gale-driven waves were rolling 35 feet high and 100 feet from crest to foaming crest . <P> At the moment of impact , it seemed that the Sky Queen had been swallowed . People watching from two circling trans-'atlantic DC-45 saw her disappear completely in a great wash of white water . Then , miraculously , she reappeared " like a huge whale " and wallowed noisily toward the rolling Bibb . <P> Giant Swing . That was only the beginning of the Sky Queen 's ordeal . The sight of her , tumbling and pitching " like a giant swing at Coney Island , " made Captain Paul Cronk , commander of the Bibb , feel " horrified " and " sick . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had " found myself frozen stiff in the middle of my quarters " by the news that the plane carried 69 people . <P> The plane seemed possessed of devils . It washed down on the cutter , crashed into the ship 's hull and stove in its own nose . For seven hours , the cutter could do little but stand by as close as Captain Cronk dared , and make a lee as the plane 's crew nervously jockeyed the Sky Queen 's nose into the wind . <P> <P> Ten Thousand Goodbyes . In those long hours , the cabin of the wildly pitching plane became a stinking chamber of horrors . Many of the passengers expected to die , waited for the plane to open up with the smash of every sledging wave . Passengers and crew grew violently seasick , vomited helplessly on themselves and each other . Exhausted children were sick , fell asleep in the foul , chilly air , woke and were sick again .                  @ @ @
