Within four blocks of each other on Manhattan 's Morningside Heights are two of the most famed U. S. schools-Horace Mann and Lincoln . Run by Columbia University 's Teachers College , they are laboratories of Progressive Education , have been models for public schools far &; near . Lincoln School is " experimental , " changes its curriculum whenever it has a new idea . Horace Mann is a " demonstration " school with a stable curriculum , made up in part of ideas tried at Lincoln . <P> Last year progressive educators heard with dismay that T. C. 's Dean William Fletcher Russell planned to merge Lincoln and Horace Mann* ( TIME , June 5 ) , because T. C. had an $844,000 deficit , and Horace Mann was not paying its way . Lincoln 's parents and teachers protested that marriage between a " demonstration " and an " experimental " school was impossible . Said old Abraham Flexner , one of Lincoln 's founders : " In that amalgamation no human ingenuity can prevent the practical extinction of the Lincoln School . " Proclaiming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents set out to prevent the merger . <P> Leading the fight against Lincoln 's extinction were Parents Nelson Rockefeller and Elmer Davis ( radio commentator-TIME , Jan. 22 ) . They had an ace in the hole : Lincoln School has a $3,000,000 endowment , given by the Rockefeller General Education Board , which T. C. , as trustee , is supposed to use only for educational experimentation . <P> Last week , after long negotiation with Nelson Rockefeller , T. C. 's Provost Milton C. Del Manzo , Dean Russell 's agent in the merger negotiations , called newsmen into his office , handed them his long-awaited report . It proposed a compromise : that the combined school should be experimental , have Lincoln 's name , be housed in Lincoln 's building , have a board of overseers controlled by Lincoln and Horace Mann parents . Lincolnians sniffed at two jokers : 1 ) the board of overseers would be merely advisory to Dean Russell ; 2 ) there was no guarantee that income from its $3,000,000 endowment ( $184,000 of which T. C. had already diverted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . Said Spokesman Davis : " Further negotiations , it seems to me , are necessary . " <P> If Lincoln 's parents were dissatisfied , Horace Mann 's parents ( among them : Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia ) were flabbergasted . They accused Dr. Del Manzo of " complete reversal " of his promises to them , called it " not a merger but a murder . " Soon they began to demand a financial accounting from Dean Russell , charging that the college had saddled their school with excessive " service " charges , had compelled it to provide free tuition for T. C. faculty members ' children , had thus created an artificial deficit . Horace Mann , they reminded Dr. Russell , was a year older than T. C. itself , had in fact fathered the college . At an indignation meeting of 500 Horace Mann parents , up jumped Parent William A. Shimer , executive secretary of the United Chapters of Phi Beta Kappa .
