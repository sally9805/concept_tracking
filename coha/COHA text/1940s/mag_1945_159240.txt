After five days of earnest discussion , filled with friendly give &; take , the President of the United States and the Prime Ministers of Britain and Canada came forward last week with a firm proposal on the future of The Bomb . What they said was this : <P> They did not feel that the immediate divulging of the know-how of the atom bomb 's manufacture would contribute anything to keeping the peace . In fact , they thought it might have precisely the opposite effect . So no secrets would be given out-yet . <P> But the three heads of state felt it absolutely necessary that The Bomb and all other weapons of mass destruction be internationalized as soon as " effective , reciprocal and enforceable safeguards acceptable to all nations " could be set up . <P> Their specific suggestion was the establishment of a special commission under the United Nations Organization which would tackle the problem methodically . And they laid out the steps for the commission to follow . It would first arrange for the free exchange of basic scientific information among all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atomic energy is used only for peaceful purposes the world over . <P> As a third step it would draw up a convention for the elimination of atomic and all other mass-destruction weapons ( e.g. , gas , bacteriological warfare ) from the arsenals of all nations . Finally , it would set up the safeguards-perhaps through international inspection-to see that the convention was continually adhered to . <P> Next Move . That was the plan . The Messrs .

But they believed that what they had proposed could be made to work , through the United Nations Organization , providing that all nations believed in UNO and made it strong enough to put it beyond the successful challenge of any single nation . <P> As such , the plan put the next move squarely up to Russia . Before the communique was issued there was some speculation that it would contain demands on Russia for a full statement of its political and economic aims . But Truman , Attlee and King asked for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded that in exchange for atomic information <P> Russia give a full guarantee that it would work with and put its trust in the United Nations Organization . <P> In its final form , the plan was largely of U.S. origin . Prime Minister Attlee 's great contribution was his insistent urging that some agreement be put forward now . <P> Sixty Days . Immediate reaction in the U.S. and Britain was approval . The plan contained no statement or policy which could not have been uttered two months ago . But its virtue was the obvious virtue that , after months of hysteria and confusion , a statement had been made ; at last there was an Anglo-American agreement for the rest of the world to accept or reject .
