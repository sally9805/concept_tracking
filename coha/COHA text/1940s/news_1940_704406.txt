txt answered . They were found , wrapped in an old newspaper , beside a Russian soldier who fell in the snow-covered forests of Agglajaervi . Perhaps their greatest value is what they show of the tragic and pitiably inefficient methods of the Kremlin , both in the war with Finland and in the " peace " at home . The letters were written to Eflm Pavloviteh by his wife Manisya , who calls him Sima , and translated into English by this correspondent . The letters begin in October , when Moscow held troops ready presumably to invade Estonia if the latter had refused to accept the Soviet terms . ' Please write ' Oct. 15 Dear Sims : Best wishes from your devoted wife Marusya and son Lyonya . Please write me whether they have listed you for long-term service . I felt from the start that it was a serious matter , but you insisted you would be back soon . Write me whether they issued your winter clothing . I wonder how matters will end and whether we will ever see each other again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sima , for they refused to pay me any extra allowance for Lytanya and all we have is seven rubles for the two of us to live on , Sima . Some people say you will all be home soon . Others say not until peace is made . Try to get off just for one day to come home . I have lost track of many letters I wrote you . I do n't understand why you do n't get my letters . I wanted to try to come to see you the twelfth , but Peter told me I would n't find you at the postal address , and your whereabouts is kept secret . So I stayed home . If only you could write me and tell ine when to come and if you could see me . I bought you some slippers for 20 rubles and some shirts . I hope they will flt . Only come home . Lyonya keeps saying , " If my daddy , Sima , comes home when I am asleep please wake me . " Peter was home from Poland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be able to . Marusya . ' Get yourself a job ' Oct. 21 Dear Sima : Creetings from your loving Marusya and your son Lyonya . Firth . of all let me tell you that I got your letter for which I thank you . Sima , you tell me to get work and earn something . Even before y our letter came I had signed up as charwoman in a workers ' barrack . I worked one day and never You tell me in your letter , " Get yourself a job . I will be home soon . " But I just know you are deceiving me . If you were really coming home you would n't tell me to get a job . Why have you got a new address ? ? although you do n't mention the transfer to another town . Sima , I feel they are taking you farther and farther away from us . Marusya ' 1 do n't know . . Nov. 3 Dear Sima : Greetings from your wife and little son Lyonya . Why do n't you write ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is leaving on the fifth and that I should meet her the sixth , but I think we shall eat up our last kopeks if she comes and then what on earth will Lyonya and I do ? Write before the holiday ( Nov. 7 , anniversary of revolution ) . I do n't have a very gay holiday this year without you , Sima . I am back at the factory now . The only trouble is we have no electric current half the time , so working is very-irregular and I do n't know how much I will earn . Please write . Lyonya and I feel like two poor little orphans . We cry and cry . Sima , I inquired about the 20 rubles I sent you . They told me I must wait 42 days and then file a written request for tracing them . But maybe you received the money after all . Marusya ' They took out the rubles ' Nov. 24 Dear Sima : I sent my last letter by registered mail . If it is n't returned that means you received it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no idea where you are  --  I cry and cry because I have got no more word from you . Yesterday I went and inquired about you and was curtly told you were n't permitted to write , as you were on secret duty but I just can not believe they should be so heartlbss and cruel . The registered letter I sent you to Ostrov , enclosing Lyonya 's picture and 10 rubles has just been returned , but they took out the 10 rubles . I am so lonely and unhappy . A letter would cheer me , for if-anything happened I should have your letter as a last keepsake . I got my first month 's wage Yesterday : 101 rubles was all I earned on account of lack of electric current . I do n't know when I will get your allowance money , but I would n't care about the money if only you yourself would come home . I Can not get over the feeling I had when I saw you off at the Moscow Station that I would never see you again . Alarusya. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
