ELEVEN GENERALS ( 355 pp. ) - Flefcher Praff-Sloane ( $5 ) . <P> Ask the average citizen what the U.S. military tradition consists of and he might mumble something about plenty of planes , tanks and guns . In Eleven Generals , Military Chronicler Fletcher Pratt argues that the unique U.S. contribution is something different : the inbred American conviction that " wars are ultimately won through the aimed fire of individuals . " <P> From the Revolution on , Pratt thinks , the basis of U.S. military success has been the well-tempered amateur squinting down a rifle barrel . " Do n't fire till you can see the whites of their eyes " was plain common sense to colonials facing the parade-ground tactics of the 18th Century Brit ish army ; later , as any World War II infantryman who sweated out the world 's most thorough rifle instruction in training camp knows , the common sense of the 17703 became doctrine . Pratt leaves it to his publishers , in a jacket blurb , to add that " the national tradition that included Daniel Boone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precision bombing , and the Task Force in a later century . " Pratt himself concentrates on the infantryman . <P> Infantry on Horseback . His eleven generals ( not necessarily the best ) , from the Revolution 's Nathanael Greene to Omar Bradley , include several that few readers ever heard of , e.g. , Indian Fighter Richard Mentor Johnson and Grant 's divisional commander , James Harrison Wilson . Each , says Pratt , operated on the simple basis that " nobody is going to win a battle until somebody goes in there on foot and wins it with a hand gun . " <P> Pratt begins with essays on the temper and tactics of such well-known generals as Greene , who forced Cornwallis into his hopeless position at Yorktown , and " Mad Anthony " Wayne , the hero of Fallen Timbers . But it is Country Squire Jacob Brown , onetime secretary of Alexander Hamilton , whom Chronicler Pratt considers " the best battle captain in the history of the nation . " Once , during a British attack at Buffalo in the War of 1812 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emptied the first two boats so quickly that the others did n't even come in . Brown , says Pratt , had " some ineluctable secret of leadership that made green country boys fight like the devil . . . " <P> In much the same way , another amateur-turned-general , Richard Mentor Johnson , licked Tecumseh by using cavalry as mounted infantry . In the Civil War , two Northern generals , John Buford and Phil Sheridan , carried Johnson 's tactic still further ; they broke completely with the flashy hit &; run use of men on horseback , and employed cavalry as " a fast motorized column of infantry .
