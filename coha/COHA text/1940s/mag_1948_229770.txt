One of science 's most exciting-and most secret-projects is adapting atomic energy to aircraft . Since atomic fuel ( plutonium or uranium 235 ) would have over two million times as much energy as gasoline , a " nuclear-powered " plane could fly on &; on , round &; round the earth . It could fly at its top speed all the time , and land with the same weight ( and about the same amount of reserve fuel ) that it took off with . <P> Dr. Andrew Kalitinsky of Fairchild Engine &; Airplane Corp . ( which is working under the Atomic Energy Commission ) recently explained the problem at a Manhattan meeting of the Society of Automotive Engineers . In outline , the job looks simple . A " nuclear reactor " ( essentially a controlled , slow-exploding atom bomb ) gives off most of its energy as heat . One way to do the trick is to put a reactor in place of the combustion chambers of a turbojet engine ( see chart ) . A compressor forces air into the forward end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the air shoots toward the rear end . On the way it spins a turbine , which runs the compressor through a shaft . The force of the jet escaping from the tailpipe pushes the airplane forward . <P> Hot Engine . All this is not as simple as it sounds . A small , controlled reactor has been built ( TIME , Sept. 8 ) , but putting one into a jet engine involves tremendous difficulties . The reactor must run very hot , but not burn itself out . It must transfer enormous amounts of heat to the " working fluid " ( air ) without slowing the blast too much . <P> Probably the toughest problem of all is how to keep from killing the crew by radiation . As Dr. Kalitinsky puts it : " The radiation intensities encountered in nuclear reactors must be reduced by factors of many billion before they are safe for the human organism . " <P> Light Shield . Airplanes can not carry massive concrete shields like those around the piles at Oak Ridge and Hanford . A lighter shield is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rays . <P> Neutrons can be reflected by layers of materials ( such as graphite ) that bounce them back without absorbing them . A good reflector turns back as much as 90% of the neutrons hitting it . <P> Gamma rays have to be absorbed by dense materials like lead . " A material which is good for stopping gamma rays , " says Dr. Kalitinsky , " may not be the best when gamma rays and neutrons are considered together , and a material which is good for the innermost part of the shield may not be the best for the outer layers . There is , therefore , considerable room for weight reduction by ingenious design . " <P> Dr. Kalitinsky sounded hopeful , as if he had items of progress which he wished he could crow about . But he warned his listeners not to " expect to see an atomic-powered rocket taking off for the moon this year or next . "
