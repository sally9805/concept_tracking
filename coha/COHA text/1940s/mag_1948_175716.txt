Winter Meeting ( Warner ) tells about a brief encounter between an " aristocratic poetess " of old New England stock ( Bette Davis ) and a plebeian war hero of Polish immigrant stock ( James Davis , no kin ) . For 104 minutes they do almost nothing but talk-and then finally decide not to get married . The decision saves them from a life of such boring conversation as : <P> He ( shortly after they meet ) : " You look as if you had ancestors . " <P> She ( anticipating his first pass ) : " We seem constantly at swords ' points . " <P> He ( after she cooks breakfast ) : " I guess I just never ran into a girl as bright as you . " <P> She ( next day at her country house ) : " Would you like to pop corn ? " <P> He : " Lead me to it ! " <P> She ( as he munches ) : " I like the way your mouth moves . It 's fascinating . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All my life I wanted-planned on being a priest . " <P> She : " And all the time I thought it was something about me . " <P> He ( giving up the priesthood ) : " I want to marry you . " <P> She : " No , you 'll rot little by little in small pieces . " <P> With many more pictures like this , Miss Davis 's prestige may suffer the same fate . <P> B.F. 's Daughter ( MGM ) dilutes the never-too-potent subacids of J. P. Marquand 's socio-political satire into the sort of eyewash that is the chief ingredient of every " woman 's picture . " Marquand fans may be surprised at how easily the acid lost its effect ; most moviegoers are sure to blink unhappily at what is left . <P> The movie ( like the novel ) propounds the obvious : that when a poor man ( Van Heflin ) marries a rich girl ( Barbara Stanwyck ) her money is a problem . The passages satirizing Wall Street and the New Deal are so plainly extraneous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , Right &; Left are reconciled in one mighty smooch in a darkened Washington apartment . <P> Saigon ( Paramount ) , where Alan Ladd turns up with Veronica Lake after his fatiguing operations in China and Calcutta , concerns a lot of Amerasian hugger-mugger over a stray $500,000 . During the film , at least three well-paid players die for the purpose of bringing Alan and Veronica together . It seems a shocking waste of life until , doubtless referring to all the money Saigon is sure to make at the box office , Paramount has Veronica explain : " All this happened because it had to happen . " <P> Scudda Hoo ! Scudda Hay ! ( 20th Century-Fox ) would undoubtedly make a big hit with mules ; presumably they already know what the title means ( gee &; haw in mulese ) . The leading roles in this movie are played by two of the most gorgeous , henna hay-burners that ever plodded out of a studio make-up salon . The picture may also appeal to some children ; it tells how a horde of anti-mule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lon McCallister ) and his girl ( June Haver ) . Adult people and horses may resent the film 's hee-hawed refrain : that mules are smarter than either of them .
