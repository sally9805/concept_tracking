In his desire for an immediate showdown vote on the U.S. plan for atomic control , Bernard Baruch last week found a majority of the twelve nations in the U.N . ' s Atomic Energy Commission against him . Thereupon , after months of inflexible diplomacy , he made his first concession . <P> When Baruch , with visible pride in his role , launched his plan last June , he seemed to have the whole non-Soviet world with him . But it soon became apparent that the A.E.C. was not getting anywhere . The Russians put up a plan of their own ( completely unsatisfactory to the West ) , and simply dug in behind it . The U.S. blueprint was sound and sensible , but it was , after all , only a means to an end : effective atomic control . Baruch seemed to consider the slightest suggestion of change in the plan as an outrage and a sacrilege . <P> This gave the Russians , at least , some slight ground for yelling atomic blackmail . Baruch did nothing to improve this atmosphere by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Punishment " is not a diplomatic word , and in the context in which Baruch used it , not a realistic one . ( If a nation is immoral enough to commit a major violation , it is probably immoral enough to refuse punishment , whatever its treaty commitments . ) <P> In the A.E.C. last week , Baruch wanted immediate approval of the U.S. proposals in a report to the Security Council . Russia 's Andrei Gromyko asked for time to think it over , and perhaps to wire the home office ( where Molotov had just arrived ) ; Baruch insisted that Gromyko must agree in three days . He also ruled out any veto against punishments . <P> Behind the scenes , such thoroughly anti-Russian nations as Britain , Canada and The Netherlands have recently made known their displeasure at U.S. inflexibility . Last week Baruch realized that only two other nations , Australia and Brazil , were still with him in his demand for an immediate showdown . <P> Sitdown Walkout . At last , Baruch accepted a Canadian amendment to send the report back to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. " principles , " but to bring the phrasing into harmony with the Assembly 's disarmament resolution-a document which does not mention punishment or vetoes . The vote in favor was 10-to-0 . Poland abstained ; Russia 's Gromyko did not even " abstain " - in the technical sense . He simply said : " I am not taking part in this discussion . " This was a walkout lacking only the physical act , a sort of sitdown walkout . <P> But now that Baruch had come down off his mountain , maybe Gromyko would come down off his .
