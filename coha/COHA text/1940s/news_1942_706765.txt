txt Vote Costs Day 's Living Your fine editorial on the poll-tax fight deserves nothing but praise of all those who have been giving their all to win this war and to win the peace after the bitter conflict . The repeal bill may not seem to have much to do with gearing up national resources to an all-out war effort . But repeal is , it seems to me , at the heart of our common victory drive . Today millions of Negro and white workers and poor farmers who want to help their country 's war are unable to do so because they have been deprived of their right to vote . Repeal of the poll tax will enable millions of Americans to take their place in their country 's total effort . It should not be forgotten that the dollar poll tax for the disfranchised ten million is the equivalent of a day 's living for their families . SAMUEL WOLCHOK .
