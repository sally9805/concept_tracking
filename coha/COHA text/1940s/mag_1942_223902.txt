Glass is now going to war in a big way as a replacement for copper , aluminum , bronze , other scarce metals . Already centrifugal pumps with impellers , plates and other parts of glass are whirring . U.S. laundresses will shortly wield electric irons having glass sole plates . Glass plumbing for private homes may be around the corner . Industrial glass plumbing is already here to stay . Recent developments include easy-to-use glass-welding gadgets so simple that ordinary maintenance employes in the U.S. food industry can be trained to repair and even to install glass plumbing . The U.S. fisherman who uses cork or aluminum floats for his nets is about to switch to U.S. floats of pressed glass or Foamglas . <P> Foamglas , developed by Pittsburgh Corning Corp. , is utterly unlike ordinary glass . It not only floats but is black in color , opaque , weighs about one-fifteenth as much as ordinary glass and can easily be sawed , drilled or shaped without chipping or shattering . To make it , glass is finely crushed and heated with carbon dust in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dough as gas from the carbon froths up the melting glass into a foam which later cools and hardens while still keeping its foam structure . Waterproof , ratproof , rotproof , heat-resistant-Foamglas is finding its first big industrial use as a replacement for the cork linings of refrigerators . Today the industrial use of glass is making strides comparable to those of aluminum in the past decade , but it is challenged by plastics . The venerable U.S. glass industry , according to George Pope MacNichol Jr. , vice president of Libbey-Owens-Ford , is at a historic crossroads : it can either partially abdicate before the plastics industry , try to develop glass products superior to plastics , or jump into the manufacture of plastics itself . Libbey-Owens-Ford has jumped into plastics , but predicts that it will be a long time , if ever , before a plastic can be made which will advantageously equal the scratch-resistant surface of flat industrial glass or plate glass. * <P> Libbey-Owens-Ford went into plastics to manufacture the plastic sandwich-filler used between pieces of plate glass to make shatterproof automobile and airplane windshields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it had put its sandwich filler to completely new uses . <P> * Ordinary clear plastics have a " scratch resistance " about 500 times less than plate glass , but a new Pittsburgh plastic " C.R.39 " is claimed to have a resistance of only ten to 30 times less than plate glass .
