TOWN WITHthem go after whales . Not so close to shore , anyway . We have seen the killers go after sea lions , of course , and make a mess of them . For the sea lions seem to become hysterical and do not know what to do , except to be torn and to be killed . But with the two huge whales now , the killers were having an entirely different time of it . They would have the whales seemingly cornered against the rocks or next to the beach , and ready for the slaughter , when the whales would power their way out again . And the fight , slashed off the whales . This had been going on all afternoon , at least all afternoonfrom where we could see it , the whales using for defensetheir flukes and tails . But even so , except for frequent splashings , the battle was being fought in comparative silence , so much of it taking place under water .

All he did was to continue fishing on and on , reeling in his line , untangling the kelp from it , then casting the line out again . Even when the whales were being driven in his direction he seemed to pay no attention . Being so new here , and so unaccustomed to the ocean , he may have presumed that this was the sort of stuff which went on all the time , and that the rest of us merely were there on the shore watchingout of habit . Or he may have presumed that the ocean20THE FUNNY NAMEis supposed to have whales , so why should there be any fuss about them . I was too interested in the battle to have noticed thefisherman standing there fishing away , but Perky Adamsnoticed him , nudged me , and then began to laugh . " My God , " Perky laughed . " Will I or wo n't I ? " " Will you or wo n't you what ? " I asked . " Will I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big strike pretty soon ? " The fisherman was standing out on the end of one of the rocky promontories which forms one side of The Cove , and the harassed whales at this time were being driven right into The Cove . This certainly was an exceptional piece of business , and the whales actually were starting to churn up sand from the bottom . I remember hearing arguments going on around me whether the killer whales were killer whales or blackfish , or both or what . Yet this is a customary argument around here , anyhow , whenever killer whales appear , and perhaps should be left up to the experts to decide or to name the identical species . The killers were so close , however , that whenever they rolled over or rose out of the water we could see the white markings on their sides . But their dorsals did not seem quite as large as on some we had seen before . This could have been an illusion , of course , because of the immensity of the regular whales . Everything could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thrown out of optical proportion , except perhaps to the surf fisherman. 21THE TOWN WITHHe still fished on , as if none of this were any of his concern . There could be logic in his attitude , for he certainly had not started the fight . Besides , what he wanted for his time and money was , obviously , a five-inch bass if possible . That is what he came for . One of the regular whales got away and headed out towardssea . Perky and I could not help but feel happy about this , for it was a battle-wearied whale indeed , and apparentlysad about the whole thing . But now things became worse for the remaining whale , as all the killers now ganged up on it and let the other whale go . And still the fisherman fished on . " Look here , " Perky announced , " I ca n't take it . That guy 's got some good tackle there . " " Aw , let him lose it , " I answered . " What do you care ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight . I overheard a woman behind me say to another woman that it was not a fight at all , but merely some mother whales teaching their young how to play . She must have been a kind-hearted lady to be saying that , but her commentsbecame drowned in a lot of other comments from all around her , and it was obvious we were being given a close-up affair far beyond our own comprehension . Nothing on earth or in the sea is too big not to have enemies and to be killed by them . All obvious thoughts like these I was thinking , and how a whale is in no less constant jeopardy than a hummingbird . I was about to say something of this effect to Perky , then noticed all at once that he no longer was with me . He was down on the edge of the rocky promontory argu-22 -- r r ' . wnwnwrennIll.BBAIleflTHE FUNNY NAMEing with the fisherman . I could tell Perky was arguing . I could tell by his gestures , even from a distance . And the fisherman apparently was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the wounded whale moved into the shallow water at that spot and surfaced , and in doing so brought up the man 's string of hooks and sinker , and the several little hooks certainly were hooked , as if upon the outer rigging of a submarine . Perky grabbed the pole now and quickly took charge of it , for the fisherman by this time seemed convinced . He seemed to be expressing his conviction by doing nothing . I was too far away to see the fisherman 's expression , but when Perky snatched away the pole the fisherman still stood there with his arms out as if he were still holding it . Perky whipped the pole in such a manner that the line instantly broke , but the pole was saved . Yet I have thought afterwards that this may have been too bad . For otherwise everything might have gone crashing , the pole , the line , and maybe even the man , and we would have had more to talk about . We would have had drama . But as it is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whales , and how at least one whale got away to sea before darkness . For with darkness the fight became a blur to us , and if the second whale escaped  --  it was not found dead along here  --  we do not know how the whale maneuvered it. 23CHAPTER 4THESE WERE THE KIND OF MORNINGS HE LIKED BEST , HE TOLD ME . But , then , I believe he liked every morning best . Yet just the same I could see why he especially might like this morning . For it was an October morning , and he had almost a gunnysack full of lobsters , and we already were heading back towards shore . His outboard motor ( which he recently had repaired for the opening of the season ) was purring away as it should have been doing , these first lobsters would bring approximately a half-dollar apiece wholesale , and ahead of us was the old familiar shoreline  --  each inch of it seeminglya part of his earthly belongings . The Fish and Game wardens would be out in force today , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he did not mind . He was ready for that and for them . Today , being the first of the season , he had played24THE TOWN WITH THE FUNNY NAMEsmart , he had played very smart . He had tossed overboard all the undersized lobsters , and he had tossed overboard all the oversized lobsters , and he had his new commercial license right with him . He grinned at me , and at the shore , then tapped the hip pocket of his dungarees . A huge safety pin was fastened to the pocket where he tapped , meaning that with the license he was taking no chances . It had cost ten dollars . And I rather believe he wished he would have the opportunity to show the license to some deputy . For Perky to be doing nothing wrong or illegal whatsoever was in itself such a novelty that I believe he was pleased about this too  --  the same as with the October morning . But then , as I may have mentioned before , it seems that Perky , for as long as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . He owned his own rowboat , he owned his own ocean , and he always seemed to assume that he owned the whole town . It was as if he had inherited all these . Nor , with the possible exception of the rowboat , could the assumption have been far from wrong . For he had been born here , and had been nowhere else , and so in a sense his heritage did include the people of the town , the new ones as well as the old . I know that whenever any of us would go away and come back we invariably would ask about Perky , almost as if in fear he might not be still around . But he would be around , all right . Otherwise the town would not seem the same . For in his case God not only was good but God was25THE TOWN WITHchoosy . And God liked Perky Adams very much , and all the lobsters in the gunnysack God liked , and all the traps out here under the sea God liked , and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red band of paint . God liked these buoys extra well . " I think , " Perky said , "  --  I think I can see a game warden'scar right up there behind the palms . We 'll land at that beach . " IIe swerved the rudder of the outboard that direction . This beach he picked out was not a good one for landing . In fact , it was one of the worst for landing , now with the tide fairly well out and the boulders showing . But it was his business , his boat , his lobsters , his October morning  --  and so I said nothing . A slow swell caught the stern of the boat , and we rode in with the swell , Perky meanwhile shutting off the motor , and tipping it up to avoid any rocks . The hull scraped the coarse sand of the beach , and we both jumped out of the boat , and held the bow fast there against the backwash . We knew that the next low swell would ride the boat higher , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timed ourselves , and no sooner had we made the boat fairly secure on the higher sand than Perky grabbed the sack of lobsters and began running with them . " Let 's pretend we 're in a hurry , " he whispered back at me . " Why ? " I asked . " That 's all . Just pretend . " So I pretended , by running along behind him , and feelinglike a fool doing so . The weight of the lobsters did not26THE FUNNY NAMEseem to bother him very much , and we headed for the nearest cliff trail . But nothing happened . Nobody with a badge interceptedus , or yelled to us , or did anything . " Oh , those bastards , " Perky sighed . " Oh , those lovely bastards . We might as well have used the other beach . " 27CHAPTER 5WE TOOK THE LOBSTERS OVER TO PERKY ' S HOUSE TO BOIL THEM . He said he still could get more money for them that way . And all of this could have been a quarter of a century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing about Perky himself ever seemed to change . He was among the first people I had known on coming to this little town . Ilut , then , he was among the first people a lot of others got to know on cominghere . I would go away and come back , and he still would be around , and still doing the same things . I would go away again and come back , the same as now , and he still would be around , and still living in the same old house . What was remarkable about the house was the value of the property on which the house was located . The lot was an ocean front lot not far from The Cove , and in the earlierdays there had been any number of frame houses in the same block which had been equivalent to Perky's28THE TOWN WITH THE FUNNY NAMEhouse now , and could have kept it company . But these other houses long since had been torn down , and their places taken by homes of comparative splendor , and in keeping with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house in which Perky had been born , in which he always had lived , and apparently it was the one item of all his miscellaneous collections which he positivelywould not sell or trade or give away , and despite the arguments and pleas of real-estate agents . Obviously they saw a mighty good thing in that lot if only the funny frame house , built in old mid-Eastern style with gingerbreadand all , could be made to vanish completely , and to be no longer a detriment to the rather beautiful homes in the rest of the block . But neither law nor pleadings nor offers could budge this house out of existence , for all three methods certainly had been tried . But to all of them Perky merely would grin or say something to the effect : " Oh , someday maybe . You come around when the snow 's on the ground . " I can not say that Perky held out in devotion to his father , or for any other such memories . For I do not know how Perky felt about such matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware , and the whole town is aware , of the many tracts of land Perky 's father did own around here in the old days . There are places which still bear the father 's name , and as if just out of habit . We do not know exactly how all the property dwindled away , leaving only this house at about the time of Perky 's birth . But we do know it definitely dwindled , the same as did Perky 's own old man . There are many stories told about29THE TOWN WITHthe old than , and most of them , I think , are true . But again , none of this is really any of my business . NV it h the gunnysack of lobsters we went around the side of the house to the backyard . The belongings in the backyard had not changed very Hitch , except that now there were more of them. 1 forgot to say that from the top of the cliff Perky had carried the lobsters in his own run-down car , and that I had followed in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was to have one 's own car available whenever goingaround with him . He suddenly could go off on so many tangents , and for reasons strictly his own , that a fellow likely could wind up anywhere , or be left marooned , if depending on Perky 's own vehicle which had no running boards . In fact , his car hardly could be said to have a standardmake , but appeared to be a composite of many makes put together . For Perky , it seemed , rather enjoyed putting things together . And so it was with his own backyard . After we had parked the cars and had gone around to the rear of the house , a fire of driftwood , I noticed , already was burning beneath the reconverted oil drum in which Perky always boiled his lobsters . The oil drum was hoisted upon some rows of bricks , and the fire was burning under there . Being optimistic as usual , he obviously had started the fire before he left that morning for his boat , and before I had joined him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although as yet not boiling . But Perky , as I remembered now , was of the school30THE FUNNY NAMEaround here which believes that it is easier on the lobsters , and keeps them more tender , if they are not thrown directly into water which already is boiling . He was the first around here , so far as I know , who fell on an idea that warm water relaxes the lobsters , sort of puts them to sleep almost like an anesthetic , and that they are better off that way . At least they do not curl up instantly , as when tossed directly into boiling water , and their tendons and meat as a result remain softer . Certainly the lobsters do not flop around as much , if they flop around at all , and the water gradually comes to a boil when , as he words it , " they are sleeping . " Yet in regard to all this , whether rightly or wrongly , I do think I was the first one around here to write a feature story about Perky Adams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , long ago , on my first coming to this section , and when everything around here was spectacularly new to me , including the local clawless lobsters . At that time Perky , on my request , had been the first to take me out lobstering , showing me how it was done , and all the rest of it . My little story could not have amounted to much , and even must have seemed pointless to all the local natives who had been raised knowing these things . But just the same I at least had been impressed , almost as if I had made the discovery . For until then a lobster always had been something which had big claws on it , the same as those on the East coast . And in cartoons , or in the funnypapers , we would see these big clawed lobsters pinching people on the seats of their swimming-suits . For all cartoonsand all funnypapers at that time , apparently had31THE TOWN WITHbeen drawn in the East . I was not originally from the East . Far from it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section . Yet I do wish now that all these things here could seem new to me again . And this goes for so much else , the same no doubt as with everybody . For even this same surf , once such a startling observation in itself for the first time  --  even this same surf still comes in as it did in the beginning , and as it will afterwards . And this surf is more like years than we may realize sometimes . Each surf comes in , each breaks , and each is no more . . . . Anyhow , I helped Perky put more wood in the fire , and we dumped the lobsters into the big drum . He asked me the time , and I looked at my watch and told him . For his own watch , he explained , was being soaked in kerosene until he could get around to taking it apart and cleaning it . He said he had gotten his watch wet in the ocean a day or so ago , and that accurate timing was necessary for good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be boiled I asked him how things had been going with him lately , and while I had been away , and he answered : " Mighty good . Yep , mighty good . " But , then , he always answered like that , and so I did not pay much attention to his answer . Yet the backyard , I could see , was filled with plenty of unfinished business , or with " business in progress , " whicheverwould be the term for it. 32THE FUNNY NAMEIf Perky were the kind who would have put out a shingle for all his various enterprises , the shingle would have had to be a large one . For , aside from lobstering , the shingle would have had to contain such items as polishing abalone shells and selling them , building surfboards , repairing boats , taking out fishing parties , giving tips on real estate ( except his own house and lot ) , deep-sea diving ( wheneverhis diving suit was in working order ) , giving swimminglessons to tourists ' children , taking rowboat parties to and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this the shingle would have to go . And also , if he wanted to be really frank about it all , which he usually was , it likewise should contain the item : " Bachelor  --  at your service , ma'am . " For , another quirk about Perky was that he always knew how to dress fairly well whenever he wanted to dress fairly well . At least , to get by locally . For one outfit of what I suppose is called " sport clothes " usually is sufficient for any of us to get by with here at an afternoon or evening gathering . But in addition to having a loose outfit of this sort , Perky actually owned a double-breasted Tuxedo of bluish black and also a summer Tuxedo coat of gray . So , for this reason he was doubly fixed for getting by anywhere or at anything in this little town , and usually did . This was another phenomenon about him . Most of the working day long he could look like a tramp , but he was not one . Out-of-town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his oldest of dungarees , and automaticallymight think : " Ah , that must be one of those pictur-33THE TOWN WITHesque characters you read about . One of those  --  what do you say ?  --  beachcombers . Maybe we ought to take his picture . " And , indeed , I do remember one time when such a thing occurred and Perky actually was offered a fifty-cent tip for posing . He had been asked to pose this way and that way several times , as the man with the camera wanted the pictureand the lighting just right . Perky had been working on something at the time  --  oh , I remember  --  he had been trying to salvage a long piece of trap line which had brokenoff in a storm and was now tangled inside a heap of washed-in kelp . He was hacking at the tough strings of kelp to free the line , and then afterwards , as was his custom , he would wash the salt water out of the line , repair it , soak it in tanbark , then eventually put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The visitor with the camera seemed interested in all this , but expressed the one regret that Perky , while having the pictures taken , was not smoking an old pipe . But Perky , it seems , rarely smokes a pipe . With him , it usually is cigarettes or once in a while a cigar . But anyway Perky posed the several times that were asked of him , and then quite solemnly accepted the fiftycenttip from the visitor . Ordinarily Perky may not have done this , but he did it this time . And then , later in the evening of the same day , and he all washed and shaved , he saw the visitor once again . It was at an outdoor cocktail party . Perky presumably felt that he was recognized by the visitor , but that the visitor was not quite sure about it , so34THE FUNNY NAMEPerky cinched the matter by casually flipping a fifty-cent piece up and down in his hand . Yet why I should be ganging around with Perky this way , so soon after returning from another trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backyard when I should have been back in my own home working  --  all of this was something which puzzled me even then while we were waiting for the lobsters to be boiled . For this is not at all the way I had expected these years of my life to be . A living was supposed to have been easy by now , a pushover , and I would have had but to pick and choose . By this time in life I should have been able to play surly , temperamental , hard-to-get . Or I could have been some kindly old dodger who could afford by now to take it easy , and therefore could afford to gang around with anybody who interested me . But the telephone at home does not ring very much , and certainly not in regard to lavish offers requesting an immediatedecision ; instead , when the telephone does ring , the call usually is about some local thing , or some request , or for some donation , or to buy tickets for something which does not interest me whatsoever . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must come to so many of us , when we realize for sure that we are not going to be all that we had hoped to be . And thereforewe must keep on searching and searching , trying and trying , and even though our efforts day after day seem to come to no point or to get anywhere definite. 35THE TOWN WITHWe are still just where we started , and even though we do have with us now many additional memories . We have brought them back with us , and so many of them all of other places , other events , other countries , other friends . We upbraid ourselves for not being able to do more with these things , these memories , or to use them as an everlastingsource material for an easy living . We even may upbraidourselves for our own lack of gumption to trick them up a bit , to use them over and over like pieces of worn-out dough . But no , with so many of us these things , once written , or once recorded , or even once told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any reporter can feel the same after turning in a hard day 's story . It is out of his system , a thing lived and seen and done . Montana , Nevada , California , Washington , Alaska , Mexico , the Orient , Australia , Baja California , England , France , Ireland , Africa , Italy , the Pacific Islands  --  all of these and more since first I came to know Perky and at a time so long ago . And yet it does not seem so long ago . But here I am back again , back beneath the same sky , along the same ocean , in the same little town . Yet gray-haired now . That is all . But Perky who has not seen any of these places or , so far as I know , even been concerned with them  --  he is not gray . And , as I previously may have mentioned , the most he has been offshore , and while conducting small fishing parties , is perhaps ten miles . But , for all of that , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish I knew this answer . Or , if ever I do learn it , there are moments when I wish36THE FUNNY NAMEI had learned it in time . For while I have been slugging out my brains looking for an answer , and even looking at distances as if for an answer , Perky has been going on along right here and , I think , living quite as much. 37CHAPTER 6THE LOBSTERS HAD BEEN BOILINGFOR ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES NOW , which should be enough . And I was helping Perky dump both the lobsters and the water from the drum when a car drove up in front of the house and began honking . I could not see the car but I could hear the honks , and because I am not especially fond of people who honk like that , and no matter where and no matter who , I said to Perky : " It seems you 've got visitors . I think I 'll beat it . " " Aw , stick around awhile , " he answered . " I 've got a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met some of your friends before , " I told him . " So I think I 'll beat it . Besides , I 'm way late now . " " But I 'm not sure you 've met this one  --  " And just then a tall apparition rounded the house . She was arrayed in what appeared to be a mixture borrowed from the Sioux , the cowboy and a little from the gaucho. 38THE TOWN WITH THE FUNNY NAMEAnd this apparition  --  wearing boots and britches today  --  seemed more to be swimming than to be striding as she rounded the side of the house and continued swimming right on towards us . The swimming effect was caused by the manner with which she propelled her fringed arms in front of her , as if both pulling herself along and at the same time clearing the way of any possible obstacles . My God , Mrs. Billings . My God , Mrs. Billings . I may have sighed it out loud or I merely may have sighed it in my mind . Yet in either event the spectacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regardless of the lapses of time between seeing her . For , in addition to her other characteristics , she is the only woman I ever knew who so masterfully could get her evenings and her mornings , her daytimes and nighttimes , all mixed up into one . She was a wizard at combining ' them . Whatever she wore in the morning would do for evening too , or the other way around . And though she preferred dressing in multi-coloredboots , britches and beaded jackets , the fringes of her sleeves seemed to be what she liked the most , so long as they were of many colors and she could wave them . But as for ever being around horses , or on them , her attitude was that horses would only be in her way . But she did like the West . " Perky boy , " she said , meanwhile ignoring me , " Perky boy , I just knew you would n't forget my lobsters . I just knew . " " Hell , I never forget anybody , " Perky grinned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Have you ever met Mrs. Billings ? " 39THE TOWN WITH " Oh , yes , " I answered . " We 've met . " " Oh , yes , " Mrs. Billings added , and then immediately turned back to Perky . " Where were you all last night ? " she demanded . " I kept looking for you , looking and looking  --  " " I was out with another girl , " he lied . " We were down on the beach . Wow , she had everything . Honest to God , she sure had everything . " " Now , Perky boy , how often have I told you not to talk that way just to make me mad . How often have I told you  --  " Then she surveyed the pile of lobsters . " Are all these mine ? " " Noo-000 . " He tried to mimic her tone . " Noo-000 , they 're not all yee-urs . " " Oh , yes they are . You promised them to me . You promisedthem to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first you 'd catch . You promised me way back last summer . I 'm going to throw a party with them . I 've just thought of it . I 'm going to throw a gcr-r-r-ate big party  --  tonight ! And now I 'm going in the house and have a drink . " " There 's nothing in there . " " Oh , yes there is , Perky boy . See , I 've brought it . See ? " And magically from somewhere between the fringes of her jacket and the Indian belt of her britches she demonstratedshe was speaking the truth . It was a pint bottle . " Maybe , " I said weakly to Perky , "  --  maybe I should be going . " " Hell no . Stick around . " 40THE FUNNY NAME " Sure , " said the lanky Mrs. Billings . " Stick around . I do n't mind stuffed shirts . " She started for the back door of the house . And Perky , watching her , merely continued grinning . " My hunch is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get those lobsters to the meat market . " " Aw , sure . I 'll get them there all right  --  maybe . " " But Christ , why have n't you killed that woman ? " Yet all he would say was " ahh-h-h . " He deliberately drawled it out for my sake , looking up at the sky as some lunatic would do , and said " ahh-h-h " again . This was enough . " Well , so long and good luck , " I said to him , then went around the house to my car and started for home . I should have been on my way long before now , anyhow , as it was time to try to get some more work done . But then , unfortunately , it always seems time to be trying to get some more work done . Yet , while driving home , I kept thinking of Mrs. Billingsand kept wishing she were the kind of woman who could be " written . " Perhaps she could be by anybody else  --  and in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I AM NOT REFERRING TO SANDiego . For San Diego has outgrown its diapers and is a city now . But I am referring to La Jolla which , although technicallya part of San Diego , is nevertheless its own communityand always has been . There are some who say the place reminds them of the Riviera . They will say this over and over as if to impress us . Or they may go more general and say it is just like living " someplace on the Mediterranean , do n't you think so ? " Yet I never have learned what our answers are supposed to be to this kind of remark , whether we are supposed to start an argument or agree or feel flattered . I know that whenever the remark is made to Perky he merely nods his head very knowingly , almost as if to please whoever is making the remark , and almost as if he has been to the Riviera , or even knows where it is . But why not ? In his mind , 42THE TOWN WITH THE FUNNY NAMEI am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one he owns here presumably reaches to the Mediterranean too somehow , and therefore the Mediterranean must be a part of what is here , a part of the whole . Sure , and part of South America also . And part of Africa . Geography obviously troubles him not at all , the world merely consisting of two things : a shore and a lot of water . Unlike so many other places too , even places in California , this little town has no traditions . That is , traditions measured in terms of a century or so . Or another way of wording it could be that the traditions of the little town are just beginning , and may not come to a head until fifty years from now , if they do come to a head . In which case the basic memories of Perky may be one of them , or through another wild guess the current doings of Mrs. Billings . Nobody knows , insomuch as traditions or influencesor even future memories are beyond anyone 's ability to predict . Yet as for present traditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or any old missions , or old forts , and for that matter no old battlegrounds which " changed history . " The nearest such battle site , if such it could be called , is some forty miles away , and nobody pays much attention to it simply because the small Battle of San Pasqual changed nothing , did not have to be fought . Besides , the Americans in this battle got hell knocked out of them by Old Californians fighting mainly with lances . But afterwards things went on the same as usual . Everybodygot chummy again . It was neither a Thermopylae nor a Bunker Hill . It was merely a momentary mess. 43THE TOWN WITHAnd so we of this little town are just here is all , living our days by the sea , and we have not been a part of " his-tory . " Now the City of San Diego may be slightly different in some of these respects . At least a lot of history and pamphletsare written about it : the old Spaniards , Father Serra , the first California mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Plymouth Rock of the West Coast , " all such flourishes as that . But we of near-by La Jolla do not really know what our own name actually means , other than it obviously is not that of a saint . The poetically minded say that La Jolla in Spanish means " the jewel , " but it does not mean " the jewel " in Spanish . Others say that La Jolla is a misspelled Indian word meaning " the hole , " and refers , so they say , to our valley-like indenture between our mesa and our shore . But this interpretation is wide open for argument too , and especially since our aborigines around here were as stupid and lazy as could be found on the continent and did not really have a true language , or much of anything else , and did not care to be bothered . Grunts were sufficient for a vocabulary the same as lizards or grasshoppers were sufficientfor a meal , and so the aborigines would have been the most surprised of all possibly to have known that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the meaning or the non-meaning of the name really makes no difference so long as there are at least a few people besides ourselves who know how to pronounce it as it is pronounced today . Or so long as there are a few44THE FUNNY NAMEpeople besides ourselves who do not think we are joking when we try to put through a long-distance call home from somewhere else . Or who do not repeat to us here , as if brand-new , all the accumulated stories which have been going on for years now about travelers struggling over the " J " as a " Y , " and finally ending up by calling La Jolla something else maybe San Luis Obispo or San Juan Capistrano , and that they visited here during the months of " hoon and hoo-lye , " and out of politeness we have to laugh very much each time . Yet all of this is merely part of living here , and we must take it along with the winter salt spray on our windows . And we must accept the fact too that novelists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the comparativefar north of us , towns with a " background , " do not have to include that familiar phrase " the name of the town is purely fictitious . " The novelists can come right out and say Carmel is Carmel , or Monterey is Monterey , the same as San Francisco ( oh , so far north of us too ) is San Francisco . But in regard to fiction about La Jollaahno , not yet . It had better be called some other place , and often I wonder why . For , after all , we do have our own post office . We are legal. 45CHAPTER 8WE ARE LEGAL AND , I THINK , WE ALSO ARE A MOOD . For here we know ahead of time what it is like to be old and dying . Nowhere else perhaps are there so many aged or retiredpeople living within a similar circumference . This can not help but have its effect on all the rest of us . We see our own beginning and our own ending , and have but to fill in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envy over somebody , the comparative ease , the lack of struggle , with which he now seems able to live his life , and then next day we hear he is dead . The town goes on like that . Yet this thing of living here someday in idleness is what they aimed for , and what they have . They aimed for it while conducting Eastern factories . Or they aimed for it through wealthy marriages . Or they aimed for it through a multitude of other ways , and maybe have devoted some46THE TOWN WITH THE FUNNY NAMEfifty years towards obtaining these five . The interval may be more than five , it may be less , but the proportionate equation remains much the same nevertheless . A brief glimpse of idleness by this sea  --  this same sea , these same sandstone cliffs , which serve as our only cathedrals  --  and these same rocky coves which Perky Adams has had all the time , he who knows nothing else . These old people , while looking out on all this , and on the surf which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the ocean 's horizon  --  these old people cannothelp but wonder , I suppose , who will be taking their places here , and seeing all these things , four years from now , or even one , or maybe even tomorrow . For the rest of us wonder about it also , and often . Within a comparatively short distance from this window , for instance , is a certain jutting reef which always contains , or almost always contains , a spectator . He or his counterpart always is there , yet from this distance he alwaysappears to be the same person . Yet inasmuch as he also is mortal like the rest of us , we must presume that his place likewise will have to be taken by somebody else someday . And also someday it will have to be other people who do the looking out and see the spectator there . For all of this likewise is part of the little town . The turnover is neither slow nor uncertain , and it does have a sameness . So , with the ultimate constantly being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each additional day , even though we accomplish nothing during the day , can be47THE TOWN WITH THE FUNNY NAMEmade to seem like an accomplishment  --  just the additional day  --  if we want it to seem that way . We could go around congratulating each other instead of bemoaning our lack of tasks accomplished . Nor do even our own local pelicans year after year seem too disturbed about wanting to become more than they are . They do not appear to have any growing pains about wanting to become anything else , at least instantly , or to make one more step in evolution while still alive , while still in their own generation . Some of us humans , of course , are more likely to want to have done that . I know I have wanted to do that . But pelicans merely keep on being pelicans . And their attitude , I think , becomes more and more our own attitude , the longer we live here . We may look at a line of pelicans in their mysteriously rhythmical flight  --  when the leader stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their wings  --  we may look at this and we may think : " Ah , at least there 's one pelican which must have ambition , the leader . " But it may not be that way at all . Instead the pelican in the lead may be a bit put out by all these others tagging him around wherever he goes. 48CHAPTER 9THE NEXT TIME I SAW PERKY WAS AT A COCKTAIL PARTY . As usual he came alone . This has been his custom . He usuallycomes alone but does not always leave alone . In this town of few unattached men , an invitation to Perky apparently is a convenient thought to any hostess . This could have been different perhaps if he did not know how to get along at these affairs . But he knows how to conduct himself a lot better than I do . If the liquor is not to his liking , if it happens to be coloredstuff dipped out of a glass bowl , or if it happens to be some other mixed-up concoction , he merely pretends to be drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or with water , and they say this also had been the way with his father . But , then , the memory of Perky 's father always is being brought to somebody 's mind somehow , and I am sorry never to have met the old man , or even to have seen49THE TOWN WITHhim . For even though he may have owned at one time too many local tracts of land for his own taxable good , I am not concerned with that , other than with the possible influence on Perky . Seeing what had happened to his father may have been one of the reasons ( yet it is just a thought ) why Perky wants to be bothered with nothing of that sort , or at most with only very little . But with what so haphazardly is called " social activity " in this town , I would say that Perky gets around a lot more than I do . By this I mean , bluntly , that he receives more invitations . But in this I am not being truthful . His patience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become annoyedor outspoken about anybody or anything , and this is what I often am doing , unfortunately , and especially while drinking too many glasses , and without realizing it , and it never seems to help . For there are times at these cocktail parties , especially if in some well-to-do home , when I feel for sure I am only bluffing or dreaming , and when my whole background shrieks out at me and says : " What the hell right are you doing here ? " Nor is there an answer except to drink a few more than I should , all of which gives that false courage which also can lead to too definite opinions at times . And the social ham , I am afraid , can come out all over me . For I certainly was not born to any of this . And not having been born to it , and not even having had the time to try to acquire it , I remain forever curious about this mystical something about which I know nothing  --  this spectacle of financial security in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years , is one adventure I would50THE FUNNY NAMElike very much to have . And often , while looking back , I sometimes think it is the one adventure I have not had . But just the same this town has given me my first experience , limited though it is , in seeing fairly rich people close up in their fairly rich homes . And so how tempted I often am to write something about rich people , some fabulousnovel about week ends in summer homes , and rich anxieties , and all the rest of it , and simply because I know nothing whatsoever about the subject , or how it feels to be that way . Yet if everyone limited himself to what he really knows , how little would ever be written . Or broadcasted . Or said on a lecture platform . But in my own case I would like to appear , if merely once and merely briefly , as a criterion , a connoisseur , a man of leisure , a snob , or as somebody who has but to pick and choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that ambition , the next best thing would be to try to write one of these many books we read about such people , and have them going all around the world in their own yachts or their own planes and meeting duchesses and buying statues . Yet always , and as an everlasting reminder of how out of keeping this would be , is that shack on a Montana prairie where I lived so many of my days as a kid . For this shack was a shack , and that is all it was . It was not a cabin or a two-room house . It was a shack with four strands of baling-wireholding up the tin chimney against the winds , and each wire attached to a corner of the square roof . And all around us was nothing but the prairie flatness , 51THE TOWN WITHmiles and miles and miles of it , with neither a shrub nor tree nor trickle of running water . But then at the time , and at that age , and having known little else , I naturally presumed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it made no difference . As long as we have nothing with which to make comparisonswe have nothing over which to feel sad . And we definitely did not feel sad about ourselves then . Instead we felt lucky , even happy , every time we had somethingtucked away somewhere to eat which , in winter , was mostly oatmeal gruel . But we felt lucky to have the sack of it there , and in defiance of the enemies outside which were snow and moving snowdrifts . I can , then , never write a society novel , and as much as I would like to . For thirty dollars , or even twenty dollars , if we had it , was something which would keep us through the winter . And the sum , after having heard it repeated so often by my parents , still amounts to just that  --  a sum necessary for the whole winter . For such is the memory association of ideas . I regard all this as comedy now , for it is comedy . Yet my mathematics as a result are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their peculiar expense , I look at the tables of things and automatically judge them as " three winters " or " four winters " or whatever the quick estimate may be . And none of this , to be sure , is the smart train of thought for anybody who might like to bluff it out that he belonged . But Perky at these parties , I know , is not bothered in52THE FUNNY NAMEthe least that way . Yet ironically he is still the one around here whom out-of-towners first of all would regard as the town 's beachcomber or ne'er-do-well or bum. 53CHAPTER 10SOMETIMES LIFE IN THIS TOWN IS LIKENED TO BEING ABOARD SHIPduring a long cruise , as for instance one of those former around-the-world cruises . We can not avoid seeing each other or running into each other wherever we go , wherever we turn . As a result we may know more about each other than we should know . Even for our own good this can be true . If we did not know so much about some of these other people we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We look at some of the fine homes and we think how contented or how satisfied the people must be who live in these homes . Such thoughts used to be my thoughts , I remember , until through the years I underwent this gradualadventure of absorbing more about these people  --  the same as at this cocktail party . It was simply a case of my having been late in learning , 54THE TOWN WITH THE FUNNY NAMEof course , what everyone else has known all the time , namely that everyone 's life has a catch to it somewhere , that nothing mortal can be perfection , and that some of the people I previously may have envied are now people I truly can pity . Yet how stupidly long I have been in learningit !  --  in learning the simple truism that each life always has some hidden catch . The catch may be some insane relative . The catch may be some painful and lingering ailment . The catch may be some terrible and personal thing which occurred in the bygone and which is not forgotten and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one of a number of nasty crosses or maybe even several of them , and all within one home with a beautiful lawn . Yet I may not have learned this at all , and as childishly tardy as I have been about learning it , if not for the shipboard-like quality of this town . The shipboard aspect is furthered physically by our surroundings . Almost everywhere we look , or in any direction , is either the ocean or something relative to the ocean . We are located out on a broad peninsula . We form a subduedV out here , or rather an inverted V , and it is the ocean which confines us here . And without realizing the snobbishness of it we likewise are divided into first- , second- , and third-class passengers , and with either money or influence being the reason , as on any other liner . Perhaps the life in small midland towns also can be likened to being aboard ship . I would not know . But I would assume that the comparison could not be as paramountas it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea , 55THE TOWN WITHand it is not a prairie . The sea is the sea , and it is not a forest . Here we do not go around walking or riding automobilesbeyond our very definite border , our deck . This is the Edge and we have no other overland direction to move but sideways or backwards . And aboard here the old among us have little to do now but wait . They could walk off the ship , of course , yet this will not make them younger . At first I was going to be cynical about all this , and cynicalabout the cocktail parties such as this one . For anybody who has attended one cocktail party here virtually has attended them all . In a sense they remind you of a traveling troupe which puts on the same show with the same cast time after time , and with identically the same dialogue . The only slight alternation is the locality , meaning the home or meaning the stage . But in time the circuit calls for a repeat performance at each of these . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the type of drinks usually are identically the same , and usually the table is spread identically the same  --  at one end sliced ham , at the other end roast turkey  --  and even the hired help which helps serve these things is identically the same . This help , hired for the occasion , moves from home to home the same as the invited cast . And so it comes to be in time that we are as familiar with the mannerisms of the help as we are with the mannerisms of the guests . We are all on very good speaking terms with the help and it is smart to remain that way . For it will be someone else 's turn to hire the same help for next time , or at least try . If the56THE FUNNY NAMEsame help already is engaged , and therefore unavailable , then the proposed cocktail party will have to be arranged for a date when the same help is available . This is how it goes and it is a ritual . The help furthermore knows as much about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the help even knows more . For the help is in on the knowledge of what is said about us after we leave the premises of each performance . But having been away from town for quite some time I was not at all displeased with the invitation to attend this cocktail party . Nor was there any telling when I would be invited to another . For in this town , as regards invitations , I am what might be called a borderline case . In other words I am not a " must . " I am not one who " just simply has to be invited . " I can be , or I can not be , as nobody really owes me a return invitation to anything , and partly becausethe local cocktail circuit does not include my own home . Besides , whenever I do attend ( which means whenever I am invited ) one of these cocktail parties I try too hard to overcome that same old bugaboo , that same old feeling of sham , by drinking too many and talking too much . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quite fatal socially , emotionally and in the morning . For , unlike so many who do make the local cocktail circuit , I still have to work for a living , an item which calls for getting up early next day . These cocktail parties usually are supposed to begin at five , according to the announcements . But this means that the curtain on each performance does not really rise until six , and the performers begin trooping in about that time. 57THE TOWN WITHSome secretly make a habit of eating a small dinner before they come , and this may be rather wise . For around eight , when they should be going out to eat , they are so satiated with the customary stuffed eggs , the customary colored tiny sandwiches , and the customary olives , that nobody really cares anymore whether that night he eats a regular dinner or does not eat one . Yet all of this indecision is part of the show too . The performers discuss whether or not they are going out someplace to have a regular dinner , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault of mine I was late arriving , even later than the proverbial hour late , so unfortunately I entered at that awkward moment when the same cast of guests , and with the same type of glasses in their hands , were casually glancing towards the entrance now and then to see if by chance anybody new was going to enter . This was still the same as in the old days . Nothing had changed . Nor had the opening words of greeting changed : " Well , well , well , have n't seen you for a long time . Well , well , well , have you been away ? " It might be that I had not been invited for a long time . Or it might be , as in the current circumstances , that I actuallyhad been away . But in either event my own answer would make no difference and I was not expected to make one . For immediately we began asking each other how we were  --  for , oh yes , it was all clear now . None of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with surprising rapidity . And it was just then , as I was reaching for a glass , that I first noticed Perky. 58THE FUNNY NAMEOften at some house gathering all of us are aware of how people who are at a loss or nervous or bored will begin petting a dog or a cat , and talking with it , and for no apparentreason perhaps other than that the cat or the dog is neutral , does not talk back , and does not even give much of a damn . But the animal , because of its neutrality and its faked interest to the attention being given it , does serve probably as some sort of release . And this may be another reason why Perky usually had any number of people around him talking and laughing , as they were doing now , while he stood over near a corner . He was safe and he was neutral . In looking over the people at this cocktail party an outsiderwould presume there was not a single trouble among the whole lot . But what an act they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had I not known this town so well , my first privilege in ever knowing a town well , I would have felt the same as an outsider would feel about it  --  nothing but a good time being had by all  --  and all the time . Yet we who have known their ailments all along , and their real ages as well , and their secret little tragedies , we no longer may feel as cynical as we may feel sad . For by this time next year some of the people , of whom we could make fun now , will have vanished . They will have been buried or cremated . And these stupid parties with the same colored sandwiches , the same colored drinks , will have been the fade-out . We may hate a person very much , we may stay awake hating him and his greed and the methodshe may have used in the past for reaching his present59THE TOWN WITH THE FUNNY NAMEsecurity , and then all at once he is no more . We read of it in the morning . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboard this ship , and Perky alone seemed neutral and everlasting . I walked over to him and he was being kidded , I gathered , about Mrs. Billings . She was not present , of course , and for a reason no longer hard to explain . In contrast she had originated her own type of parties . They usually were held , or at least were started , up in her own Spanish-like home on the mesa . But from there the parties had been known to wander. 6oCHAPTER 11AROUND HERE IT IS ASSUMED THAT MRS . BILLINGS AT ONE TIME MAY HAVE HADa husband , or might still have one . But the authority for this is beyond my scope , and perhaps of no special interest . We do know , though , that her original home was in Massachusetts , and that her occasional winter visits to this town became more extended as the years went along until now she might be what is called permanent . Yet in the old days around here she was not quite what she is at present . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sportswriter would term either " willowy " or " wiry , " but she did not seem so fully determined to be herself . There had been a time , indeed , when she had compromised with the rest of the town , and had behaved according to most of the rules . These rules are lenient enough , but they do not quite allow for a lady of fashion to tap a gentleman on the fly of his trousers and say : " How they doing ? " 6iTHE TOWN WITHAnd sometimes these taps by the willowy Mrs. Billings had really hurt , like the time for instance when she and poor old Mr. Whyming were being introduced . Her tap had caused him to double up . His glasses fell off and , even though they did not break , he cared very little about ever wanting to see her again . Anyhow , Mrs. Billings ' presence at the customary cocktailparties became a thing of rarity , and finally she no longer was asked to serve on committees , either . But instead of seeming to mind any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home on the mesa became a sort of club after her own liking , or rather a sort of gymnasium . The people who came to see her were for the most part out-of-towners , and still are . But in fairness to them , and to her , it must be admitted that at first they remained well within the confines of the stucco walls of her yard . Mrs. Billings , as is her prerogative , does like colors , and so she has them . These walls are painted a grapejuice purple . I am mentioning all this now because so much of the talk around Perky at the cocktail party continued to be about her , one of the possible reasons being that the nearnessof her home could have been keeping her ever in mind . For her home was directly up there beyond the windows . In looking out of them we could not help but see the purple . And in seeing the purple we could not help but wonder what was going on inside . Quite a few cars were up there , none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mrs. Billings , despite her absence at this cocktail party , was not sitting up there in loneliness and brooding about it. 62THE FUNNY NAMEBut even while we were thinking about all this , one of the hired help went over to Perky and said : " You 're wanted on the phone , Mr. Adams . " So , then it had started  --  the phoning  --  and none of us needed to be told who was doing the phoning . During previous years so many of the men present had been victims of this phoning , and at the damndest hours , that they no longer laughed about it . Nor did they give thanks for the memory . Likewise they knew that the phoning would ( . : ontinue unless something was done about it , either by leaving the receiver off the hook or , as in this case , by having Perky obey the summons and go up to the other I rouse . When he returned from the little telephone room I asked him : " Well , Perky , how about it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he answered . " She said she wanted me to bring along Mr. Stuffy Shirt too  --  and the whole party . Everybody . Everybody . " 63CHAPTER 12IN THIS TOWN WITH ITS CUSTOMARY CLUBS , ITS CUSTOMARY AND EXPENSIVEgolf and Country Club , its expensive though not so customaryBeach and Tennis Club , its customary luncheon and culture clubs , the one and only club in which I am a member is an unofficial sort of thing . Or it may not even be a club . But we who belong , or rather we who are admittedor accepted at any time , have reasons for regarding our outfit as the most exclusive of them all . For anybody can get into the other ones if they pay the dues . But we have no dues other than an obligatory loyalty to each other . And this loyalty may mean protecting each other , or covering up for each other , whenever strange things over which we have no control may occur . And in an ocean town , especially one containing a Mrs. Billings , 64THE TOWN WITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and mainly at night . Our clubhouse is not a clubhouse as such , but a shack set back in the cliff at The Cove . This is the Lifeguards ' Shack . We always have called it that , and nothing more . It is an oddly shaped room built partly alongside the cement stairs leading down to The Cove , and also built partly under the stairs , and always it is dark and damp inside . But this is not our fault . For there is only one little window . It is screened , and it faces towards the north . Consequently no sun enters . Yet in here , especially on cold days when nobody is in swimming and needs to be guarded , is where we sit and argue and talk about the town and maybe about the rest of the world . But not much about the rest of the world , for our own world is right here . The interior of the Lifeguards ' Shack contains a cot covered with an Army blanket . The cot originally was for the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revived , and in need of rest  --  away from the crowds who usually watch patients being rescued , revived , and in need of rest . Yet the cot has not been used for such a purposefor a long time , as ordinarily a rescued person wants to disappear as soon as he can , and usually without a thanks , as if thereby in his own mind the whole embarrassingincident has been canceled . He may talk about it years later , of course , and even may enlarge the details of what he himself may have done during his own danger . But rarely does he want to talk about it right then , or even admit it . He prefers to vanish . 65THE TOWN WITHSo the cot seldom has been used for its original purpose , but instead has become the one practical place upon which we clubmen may sit and discuss . It is true , we do have one chair in the Lifeguards ' Shack . But the legs of the chair are not too secure , and the back of the chair has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and are sharp . The chair originally was salvaged long ago from the sea , and nobody has bothered to do any repairing , the chair not being worth it . But as for a telephone , we do have one , and it is our most important item . A jingle on this telephone can mean to the lifeguards on duty just about anything . It may mean merely some of the guards ' wives phoning in for errands to be done on the way home . This could be during those dull days which can extend themselves , day after day , into dull weeks . There is no telling . For at other times the jingles on the phone may go wild , and the lifeguards , being summoned here or there or everywhere along the long shoreline , may be finding themselves crowding into a single afternoon the equivalent of a whole month 's work . For accidents or near-accidents , as we know , are not averse to occurring that way . It seems that accidents also like company . The lifeguards do not presume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not care . And so whenever they appear to be just sitting around , enjoying life , then this apparently is how it is supposed to appear , and anybody at such times may envy lifeguards , and even may wish he were one . In which case , if given a choice , it may be better to be a lifeguard at a lake or at a swimming66THE FUNNY NAMEpool than to be a lifeguard along an ocean with its surprise rips , its crazily behaving surfs at times , and its unfamiliar Sunday bathers who do presume too often that the ocean is but another lake or another swimming pool  --  like those nice places back home . The telephone in our clubroom , the Lifeguards ' Shack , also has a double connection with the police station . For a policeman 's beat , and quite obviously , goes only as far as the shoreline ordinarily , and so it is up to the lifeguards to carry on from there . . . . But anyway , and as one clubman to another , it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any other club in town for knowing or for overhearing  --  everything. 67CHAPTER 13BUT EVEN THE LIFEGUARDS , MY OWN TRIED AND TRUE BROTHERS OF THEclub , often try to needle me into doing something they have no right trying to needle me into doing . We will be sitting around our clubroom , the Lifeguards ' Shack , and all at once one of them will say : " Have you written up anything about Mrs. Billings yet ? I sure want to see you write up something about Mrs. Billings sometime . She ought a make a whole book  --  " And then , as if to be helpful , they may go ahead and tell me more incidents about her , some of which I already may have known . But I never can understand this unintentional conspiracy to have me be the fall guy in regard to Mrs. Billings or anything about her . For , after all , she has not done me any harm . And even the adjectives she once in a while may use about me , adjectives denoting smugness , 68THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these may be somewhat correct , inasmuch as this is my hometown and therefore I try to be on my best hometown behavior . But at any other place , and were I but a visitor to that place , Mrs. Billings and her constant retinue of out-of-'owners might have seemed a high spot for anybody on the loose . For maybe all of us have met her and her kind somewhere , and in confidence may still talk about it should we as the guests ever see each other again . We will talk about that high old week end or something . For geography and circumstances , it is true , have a lot to do with anything , one 's so-called morals or anything , the same as is credited to latitudes . Also it may be possible that , in a peculiar way , we around here are all somewhat grateful to Mrs. Billings . In this town , with so many of the retired occupants standing clay-and-night sentry duty over their health , Mrs. Billings is one person who fully appreciates her body and who keeps on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this body , and who also keeps on showing the various uses to which she can put it . Such an attitude may be classified as paganism , or it may be classified as something else . But since this is the final shore for so many of the dwellers here , then Mrs. Billings apparently would just as soon go skipping up and down the shore rather than lie in anxiety upon it . As a general rule , though , she is not what could be called a capable skipper . That is , her body during such events is not likely to keep up with her mind . And , too , there is always the liquid . But her lanky gestures can and do , at such times , 69THE TOWN WITHcover considerable space , even though it may not be termed exactly an adagio . I may have mentioned before that Mrs. Billings seems incapable of understanding any differentiation between nights and early mornings , or even comparatively late mornings . All seem to blend into the same thing for her , and it may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her out-of-town guests have a habit of accompanying her wherever she goes , and this can be quite a few places , and usually when the rest of the town is in bed . Yet again , and in defense of this , there is no law in town prohibiting people from going swimming in the early hours of the morning of , say , around two or three o'clock . They are not expected to be rowdy about it , though , or to awaken any near neighbors . If this occurs the neighbors are likely to call the police station , and the prowl car will investigate . This does not occur often , but it has occurred . Yet our local police , and we do know them by name , appearto be exceptionally fitted for this type of town . This means that they can be , and will be , tough on outsiders but will look out for us . Nothing , then , could be more convenient for the little town as a whole , and the police and we get along splendidly . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relate ) has been getting along splendidly with the police . Whereas some people , after causing a disturbance or trouble , may try to even things up by going to confession or by promising to be good , Mrs. Billings has her own method . She may have come by this method through instinct . What she does is to throw another party and invite everybody70THE FUNNY NAMEconcerned . They may attend , or maybe only some of them may attend , but she genuinely seems to want them to attend , and on Christmas she never forgets " my dear boys on the force . " She does not forget them during frequent other occasions , and in all of this I am convinced she really is genuine . For if she were trying subterfuge she might be more subtle about it . And she is not subtle about it . Yet by continuing on in this manner , while safely out of her sight , I may be finding myself recording a eulogy about her . There is always this danger about anybody , especially with momentary distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club members , the lifeguards , want me to write about her . As one example , and the most recent one , they presume it would be a favor to me if I were to record how she caused two of them to be awakened about two o'clock in the morning to go swimmingout to sea to hunt her . I can see their point , for their reasoning about her certainly would be considerably differentat this moment than mine . Ordinarily " Mrs. Billings and party " ( as the society column would say if it ever mentioned Mrs. Billings any more , which it does not do )  --  ordinarily " Mrs. Billings and party " utilize for frequent night swimming a semisecludedbeach several miles north from the town proper . This beach is at the base of what is called the Old Indian Trail . It is nothing more than a narrow footpath winding down through a canyon among cliffs which are real cliffs and not little ones . For this reason no cars can be driven there , thereby allowing this spot of the beach at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOWN WITHNow Mrs. Billings , with all her lanky ambition , does not mind walking . Or even climbing . And wherever she goes her out-of-town guests must go . The cars are parked at the end of a dirt road on the flat , and whatever is needed ( bottles ) is carried down from there , Mrs. Billings being in the lead . I would like to presume , as indeed the whole town would like to presume , that down there upon the moonlightsands is held what is called an orgy , a word I always have wanted to use . But I do not know exactly what comprisesan orgy or how many people are required to make one . But while the rest of the town is sleeping , and while the elders may be brooding about their own incapabilities , Mrs. Billings apparently is doing just the opposite . Yet this being my hometown I still dare not go along to find out for sure just how she does it or what is done . But as long as " Mrs. Billings and party " continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quaintly term " romping , " the lifeguards had reason not to feel responsibleor even much concerned . For this other beach was technically out of their jurisdiction and still is . But the recent catch occurred when " Mrs. Billings and party , " instead of using this other distant beach , ambled around here in town and finally descended upon The Cove . They  --  or rather she  --  was in search of Perky . And whenever she is searching for Perky her determinationis a kindred determination to what in our histories has brought a successful conclusion to so many of our greatest love stories. 72THE FUNNY NAMEPerky had remained absent , something he frequently is fond of doing , and she wanted to find Perky , and the longer the night went on the more she wanted him . Her guests could not help her do the locating . They could sympathize but they could not help . Not materially . They aided her in telephoning around town , and about midnight they accompanied her to Perky 's house which did not contain him , and from there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the while being reinforced by that substance which comes in glass , until the expedition finally terminated at The Cove . She apparently was convinced by now that he was out in his rowboat , usually moored off there . All this , the time element and all , was pieced together later . But not much later . It was pieced together after the prowl car , during its regular nightly rounds , drew up to The Cove , and when the policeman made inquiries to see if everything was all right . Well , everything was absolutelyall right . It was more than that , everything was absolutely perfect . Everybody in the party was absolutely happy . The night , or rather the early morning , was absolutelybeautiful . Nobody was being disorderly . The policemen could see this for themselves . And would the two of them have a drink ? No , they were on duty and could not have a drink . Everybody had on enough clothes . Look , the policemen could see for themselves . And would they change their minds and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , then , would the policemen mind telling the guests , just as a favor , why Mrs. Billings had not returned from a little swim ? She had just left about half-an-hour73THE TOWN WITHago . She had gone out to sea to look for Perky , and had said she would be right back , and would the policemen be good enough to tell them what were her habits on such occasions , where would she most likely swimThe two policemen in the prowl car were good enough not only to tell the guests , and immediately , but also the local police station , resulting in the police station phoning the two nearest lifeguards and awakening them in their homes . The lifeguards , snatching on only their swimming trunks for clothing , came high-tailing it down to The Cove in their own little cars . The search for Mrs. Billings was aided by the spotlight of the prowl car , and by every other available light , thereby allowing everybody in the vicinity to have a fair view of what was going on . The two lifeguards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the " can and line , " while the other went out without anything . The lifeboat had been beached high for the night , and made secure . So the lifeguards quite wisely , and to save time , assigned the launching of the lifeboat job to a few volunteers . They would have to get the oars and oarlocks from out of the Lifeguards ' Shack , and all such delays as that . So the lifeguards went out on their own , and could be overtaken later , which was smart of them . It was doubly smart of them because the search for Mrs. Billings did not last long . In addition to Perky 's own rowboat moored outside there for overnight were three or four other rowboats belonging to other lobster-fishermen , and also there was74THE FUNNY NAMEthe glass-bottom boat for the tourist trade . These formed quite a fleet of small boats bobbing up and down outside there all the time . But now , also bobbing up and down among them , was the head of Mrs. Billings . She obviously had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try , as noble and for much the same reason as why somebody in the long , long ago swam the Hellespont . To the first lifeguard to reach her she could only gurgle the cause of her guest . But the lifeguard cut it short by grabbing her from behind , and around the neck , and growling to her to shut up . " B-b-but I w-w-want Perky . " " You 're going to get more than that , lady . " He towed her to the nearest rowboat where , with the help of the other lifeguard , he tumbled her up into the boat , and neither easily nor gently . It has been said around town by some , who do not know , that Mrs. Billings by this time had discarded all her clothinginto the ocean . This is a falsehood . She had discarded nothing , remarkably not even her bright cowboy boots . For even the lifeguards , who are still so persistent in wanting to have me " write up a lot of the things about her in a book " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her clothes , all right . " After they had tugged and pushed her into the boat , they let her stay there , her hair and raiment being more elongated than ever they were . And when the lifeboat , having been launched by this time , finally brought her and the lifeguards back into The Cove , she had two demands to make . She made them while facing the policemen on75THE TOWN WITH THE FUNNY NAME the sand there , and before they could word what theythemselves wanted to say . Her first demand was that the policemen themselvesfind Perky , wherever he was , and arrest him . Yes , arrest and keep him . He had been the cause of all this . And if they arrested and kept him , she would know all the timewhere he was . Her second demand was that they now all go up to herhouse  --  the policemen , the lifeguards , the spectators , everybody  --  they now all go up to her house . It was still early and  --  well , among other things they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CALL THE INLET FALSE BAY BUT NOW IT IS BEING CALLEDby the more flowery name of Mission Bay , and it sprawls over quite a large area between our town and San Diego proper . During the time I have in mind Mission Bay was still surrounded by miles of marshes , and nobody paid much attention to the bay except to get around it or over it . But now the bay is being dredged and banked for a boating and swimming resort , and so I do not know if mullet still run there . Yet at the time the mullet did run in the bay they were not supposed to take to bait , and had to be speared from a rowboat at night if taken at all . But I have not proven it , and so am not making any definite statements . But I can make a definite statement about having come across once again in my life somebody who must be familiar the world77THE TOWN WITHaround , and the nickname I will give him is Willie-theArranger . He comes in every nationality , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to me too that he speaks all languages , including Pidgin . He is on the Amazon , on the Sahara , in the mountains , on the lakes , on the South Pacific Islands , and perhaps every large office also has a Willie-the-Arranger . He can be identified by several of his own phrases , but the spirit of each phrase amounts to about the same : " Yep , everything 's all set . We 'll get started right away . But just wait a minute  --  " Willie-the-Arranger volunteered to take me mulletspearingon a specific night . He set the meeting-time promptly at nine , and he named the meeting-place not far from the bay . " Yep , be there promptly at nine , and everything will beall set . " The rowboat would be ready , the lantern would be ready , everything would be ready . " But you just see to it that you get there by nine . " " How about spears ? " I asked . " Should I bring my own from home ? " " Naw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded all right to me , as a long spear is awkward to carry in a car , and I had several miles to drive to reach the meetingplace . I arrived there by nine , in fact slightly before nine , and Willie-the-Arranger was not there yet , and the people who were there did not know where he was , but he might be over to Bob 's . I asked who Bob was , and where he lived , 78THE FUNNY NAMEand after waiting until a quarter-to-ten I went over to Bob 's . Willie not only was there but he also was glad to see me , and he wanted the other people there to be equally glad to see me . " Meet my old friend Max , " he said , introducing me around , and then reintroducing me around . I liked his friends , and enjoyed talking with them , but as I had to be at work early in the morning I threw in a timid reminder about mullet . " Sure , you bet , " said Willie-the-Arranger . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to his friends and wanted to know if any of them wanted to come along . A couple of them did want to come along , but would have to go to their homes and change their clothes first . " It 'll only take a second . " " Okay , " said Willie . " We 'll wait . But you hurry . Be sure now to hurry . " By eleven , one of them was back , but we had not heard from the other one , and so again I timidly suggested something about mullets . " Yeah , " said Willie . " We 'll get started right away . " And then he turned to somebody and asked : " Say , do you know where I can get the keys to Steve 's rowboat ? " " From Steve , I guess , " somebody wisely suggested . " Where does he live now ? " Willie asked . " Has n't he moved ? " We were told where Steve might be living now , so we drove there , woke him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I want you to meet my good old friend Max. " 79THE TOWN WITH " Gladda knowya . Cantaskya innow . Wifesick . " I forgot just what Steve said , whether the boat was at the same place or at another place , as I could not understand him any too well , but in time Willie was handed the keys through the shadows of a narrowly opened doorway . Willie said : " Thanks , Steve . " And Steve said nothing . We drove back to Willie 's own place to get his lantern . He knew exactly where it was in the backyard . And sure enough , he found the lantern almost immediately . He shook it and found it had no oil . " No oil , " he announced , and almost happily . " We 'll have to go someplace and get some oil . Ca n't spear mullets at night without a light of some kind . Just ca n't do it . " To this remark I neither can agree nor disagree . Even to this day I neither can agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did know where there might be an all-night garage . We went there and had the lantern filled , and then we went back to Bob 's to pick up whoever else it was who was coming with us . We went into the house , and Willie said : " Okay . Everything'sall set . We 'll get going now . " " But how about the spears ? " I asked . " Oh , sure , " said Willie-the-Arranger . " The spears . " He turned to the people there : " Any of you got any spears ? Mine are all busted . " The people looked at each other , and did not seem to have any spears , neither in their pockets nor anywhere , so one by one the people shook their heads . Finally somebody announced : " I think Mike 's got a 8oTHE FUNNY NAMEspear . A good one . But he 's working tonight . Tonight 's the night he 's working . " " Where 's he working ? " " Up at Pacific Beach . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be home , he 'll let you borrow it . " " Come on , " said Willie to me . " I know where he lives . It 's right on our way . He 'd like to meet yuh . I 've told him a lot about yuh . " " No . Maybe you 'd better go alone . I 'll wait here . " " Aw , come on . He 'd like to meet yuh . " " No . I 'll wait here . " The time of night was now around one-thirty , maybe closer to two , and the suggestion was made by Willie that while he was gone for the spear the rest of us , or some of us , could go over to an all-night place on Mission Beach and get some iced beer to take along in the rowboat . Althoughthe night , or early morning , already seemed too cold for beer , especially iced beer , the errand seemed unanimously pointed towards me . I drove over and got the iced beer for the rowboat . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us climbed into it . Two others started to come along but on reaching the boat they changed their minds . One reason was an early morning wet wind which was starting to come in off the ocean and was rippling the bay . " Ca n't see mullet through ripples like that , " one of them said , shivering . " Aw , do n't be too sure about that , " consoled Willie . " If they start jumping we might see them . " 8iTHE TOWN WITHAnother reason that the two others decided not to come along was because we found we had no oars . According to Willie , this was Steve 's oversight . When he gave us the keys to the rowboat he also should have mentioned something about where the oars were being kept . " I bet they 're in his house , " Willie brightened . " We can go back now and get them . " " No . " This was my remark . Besides , a break already was appearing in the eastern sky . We found some boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our shoulders became numb from the wet wind we drank more iced beer . And in this mannerthe three of us moved eastward , ever eastward , and just in time to greet the dawn . So , a hundred years from now , when my doddering frame is being helped onto a platform to describe the old days around here , the moment for sure will be a proud one for me . The platform will be decorated with banners and bunting , and the occasion will be known as " Old La Jollaian Day  --  Everybody Wear A Beard . " All the schoolchildren will be there , thousands and thousands of our schoolchildren  --  though by that time they may number a million . But as from the platform I look down upon their sea of happy upturned faces I will see to it that I am not on the platform alone , especially during the question hour . For when the first child asks : " And in the old days around here , Mr. Miller , did you ever go mullet-spear-82THE FUNNY NAMEing ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow speaker . Nodding to my companion on the right , I will say : " And now , children , let me introduce somebody who wants very much to meet you . He 's heard so much about you . Let me introduce my old friend and pal , Willie-the-Arranger . " CHAPTER 15THEY SAY MOONLIGHT ON THE OCEAN IS A BEAUTIFUL TI-HING , BUTit was a little different than that last night . The sea was high and had whipped itself into a nervous froth , and the waves had no regularity to them . They were running crisscross to each other , and everyway , and were beating out from shore as well as towards it , and as the moon poured down upon all this , exposing it , mankind could have been looking at all its own troubled minds under a raw light . What was surprising too was that there was no wind , there was no standard cause for what was occurring . It was as if the substance of the sea , like the substance of ourselves , simply had gotten confused with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird was flying and crying a short distance out from shore , and one seldom sees that either  --  a seabird , 84THE TOWN WITH THE FUNNY NAMEunless frightened , flying at night . Nor could I make out what kind of a bird it was , although the moon brought out flashes of the bird 's whiteness . Maybe the bird was a strangerto around here . The bird was not an egret . I would have recognized an egret . Nor was the bird a seagull . I would have recognized a seagull . Nor was the bird a curlew , for the local curlews are not white . But because seabirdsand waders are so in tune with the motion of ordinary waves , and are so quick and sharp in judging them , maybe this bird also was baffled and lost by the unusualness , and could have been crying out : " What the hell goes on here ? " There was no knighthood in last night 's belligerency . Flaming figures of waves would arise for an instant only to be knocked back down . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attack each other , and the bird kept crying . But it was not all grim . The sea merely could have gone slap-happy , jerkily nuts , under the moon 's cold floodlight and , not knowing what else to do under the attention , was simply jumping up and down . " You got ta believe me , " one jumping wave would seem to say to the other jumping waves , and then promptly fall upon its face . And there were committees in action out there , and conventions , and investigations , and staged open forums , and auxiliaries voting for or against resolutions , and hurriedpamphlets were being passed around contradicting other hurried pamphlets which were being passed around , and each little jump-up-of-a-wave appeared desperately anxious to be considered a Director of Thought . So much85THE TOWN WITH THE FUNNY NAMEso that the rest of us ashore should have felt ashamed for not being out there too and doing something . This morning , though , the ocean was itself again , as if nothing at all had occurred , as if anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first thing as usual , and there was no driftwood , no broken crates ashore , no evidencewhatsoever that anything had amounted to anything . The ocean , so accustomed to its own sureness , was back again on Big Time. 86CHAPTER 16WHENEVER WE COME HERE OR RETURNHERE  --  TO THIS EDGE , THIS STYX  --  there are those among us who do not come by themselves . They bring their memory belongings with them , and they sit among these things as they would sit among their own travel-worn dufflebags while waiting or wonderingor just puttering around . They are on the shore , and back of them is all the physical earth , back of them is all they ever have known . Nothing is more mysteriously beautiful over the ocean perhaps than a lone white gull soaring high and slow against a storm-black sky . Or for entertainment  --  while waiting  --  there are the conversations the boughs of some shore palm seemingly will be holding among themselves when the breeze from off the sea is just right . The boughs will nudge their tips against each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or the boughs will nod to each other as if in agree-87THE TOWN WITHmcnt , or will frantically push at each other as if in harsh disagreement . And all of this too could be reminders of the physical earth in the background , or of the cities , or of the business rivalries once conducted . There are reminders everywhere . Or , as with the gull against the black sky , there are mysterious colors everywhere . But not until now , maybe , did many of these waiting people have time to play their thoughts with such impractical nonsense . For how long has it been now since first they were absorbed with that all-earthly game of seeing how importantthey could become before they died . It was expected of them . It was schooled into them . It is the earth 's game , and they played it . Committees , lodges , chairmanships , public dinners , and all the influential Dans and Bills and Mikes and Hals to be known intimately as Dan and Bill and Mike and Hal that the influence may lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more public dinners with perhaps testimonials  --  perhaps even testimonials about themselves . Ah , what a busy life . And now on the Edge  --  waiting and bewildered and maybe not feeling any too good around the heart . So , if for my own part I would like to have considered all this the completion of a cycle , back to the starting point again , back to this little town where long ago I built the first home I ever owned , I merely would be making a figure of speech . The completion of a cycle is a figure of speech , and we like figures of speech . Yet this has not been the completion of a cycle at all . If anything it has been but the88THE FUNNY NAMEcontinuation of a circular-like motion , from here to there , to somewhere else , then back again , then to somewhere else and back again once more , and with my own dufflebagmeanwhile acquiring more intangible items . But what the hell , I store them here , and along with all the other dufflebags which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore , and so many of them never to be reclaimed by their more aged owners . Yet had circumstances been any different , and without the constant example of this little town ever in our minds , how different might many of our own lives have been by now , our comparatively younger lives , and while we still had the chance . Perhaps some great city would have been my own ambition , as just one example , some great city where I might be striving to declare great things , or striving to report the present and future of nations , or giving the lowdown on people to people , and leaping from typewriter to lecture-hall , to radio , then back to an office again for dictation to secretaries , then to lunch to talk over some additional contracts , then back to secretaries , then to some private gymnasium for rubdown , and then to have read to me by assistants copy which I did not prepare , which I did not see , but which I accept as my own anyway for some rush deadline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . Even if our own soul may blush at what tricks we do or at what we record , still to have been sensational may have been the thing to be . And then after a while the soul may not blush any more , and we will be known by the crowd , and the crowd will say : " My , my , my . " And that89THE TOWN WITH THE FUNNY NAMEwill have been known as a full life , a forceful driving life , and in direct proportion to how many telephones are ringingsimultaneously . But here beneath this cliff is still this surf , generation after generation of it within a single hour , and with each surf , and each color in the surf , humorously unmindful of the backgrounds , important or otherwise , of the people waiting. 90CHAPTER 17HOW ENVIOUS I AM OF PEOPLEWHO CAN WRITE AUTOBIOGRAPHIES , recording dates and places and all the incidents which , neatly following each other , lead up to the crescendo of their present time . What a blessing it must be to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the finished product , be able to say to oneself : " Ah , that is all . That is everything . " Or what a blessing it must be even to have reached a crescendo , or to have recognized it as such , and to have remembered the exact circumstances and date of that too . And to have remembered the exact conversations , and to be able to quote the exact conversations , which took place on certain hours of certain days of certain years with certain people , their full initials and all . For here on this shoreline , and whenever some old ac-91THE TOWN WITHquaintances from other places happen to come through town , and happen to drop in at the house , many memoriesoverlap again , and continue to overlap , and nothing seems to take its respective order . Forgotten things will be revived , of course , as could be expected anywhere . But that is not the main point . The main point is that even that very same night may in itself develop into a crescendo , just one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hours or the moments of living them . They are , for the time being , the tops , the pinnacle . And then next morning we literally sweep away the ashes , clear up the glasses , and the next stanza of trying to be practical starts in once more  --  until the next surprise arrival from somewhere of old acquaintances , and the next bull session . Yet these sessions in themselves so often are both biographiesand autobiographies , all mixed up , all churning away , until it would require a really skilled man to divide them , or to remember afterwards precisely what the hell had been said . But whatever it was , at the time it was said , it certainly had been both vital and interesting or even magnificent . And this , after all , may be all that counts . It may be all that counts with anything in this haphazard flash at life . I can not say . Perhaps nobody can say . My own little patio here is not really a patio , but for lack of the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somethingwe ourselves built long ago of brick , and on the side of the house next the ocean . The word terrace may be the more dignified word , but it is not really a terrace . It is instead merely a place to sit and build fires . One fire is for92THE FUNNY NAMEthe barbecue , whenever there is to be a barbecue , and the other fire is merely a plain old bonfire out of driftwood . There is nothing fancy about this bonfire . It merely is there to keep off the ocean 's night dampness and to keep us warm and to spit into and to throw cigarette butts into and to toss the used paper plates into and to sweep into  --  the sweeping to be done in the morning . Yet around this fire from time to time have come , I like to think , all the people I ever have been with anywhere in the world . This statement obviously is absurd , even outright crazy . But there is no harm in thinking it , any more than there is harm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still remember us , or want to remember us , or even may want to see us again . Yes , a fellow has the right to think so . It is one of his few privileges , the same as in reverse order he should have the privilege of forgetting all the sonsabitches he has known . But around this bonfire at night , and with these transientfriends , the driftwood flames have a way about them which make the come-on for an open forum almost , or the open sesame , for all the opinions ever opinionated , or all the arguments ever argued , or all the agreements ever agreed , or all the memories ever remembered . For the morning is far away , and so all of us can afford to talk Big Talk . And it is surprising what Big Talk we can talk , even on the blended bourbon of these days  --  and just so long as the morning still seems far away . Indeed , morning may never come at all . Yet if it does come we are confident by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second wind we93THE TOWN WITHare now confident of anything , and hangovers are a thing of history . They will not occur on earth any more . So we decide all about Russia . We decide all about China . We decide all about Europe , the Argentine , the Pacific Islands , all about women and taxes and the United States . We even dare to try funny stories even in dialect . And we recall experiences about each other which we have no business recalling . But now in front of this fire , it is all right not merely to recall them but also to tell them outright . And we make great decisions , amazing decisions , and we wonder why we had not made these decisions before , or even thought of the decisions before . Sure , we know just who to phone or to telegraph tomorrow . He is an important man now , maybe too important , but he will remember us , and he will like the idea , and he will get us out of our financial dilemma or any dilemma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  here beforethe fire . And then , all at once , it is way past time to go to bed . And then , all at once , we already have gone to bed and already have awakened in the morning . I look out at the patio . It is vacant , the fire is black , but the chairs are still facing every whichway , bumping one another , nudging one another , at queer angles to one another , as if the recent occupants were still in them and still arguing and still settling great matters , and still confident about themselves from here on in . But already they have been gone for quite some little time . But gone where ? To catch some early plane perhaps. 94THE FUNNY NAMEOr some early train . Or maybe just gone . I do not quite remember . But my job now is to clean up the patio , to sweep the stubs away , to pick up odd pieces of glass , and to wonder who were the respective owners of so many of the little things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody'sown brand of cigarettes , here may be somebody 's initialed folder of matches , here may be somebody 's pencil-clipfound lodged between the bricks , and here beneath a bench may be a tiny sheet of notepaper containing some scribbled address , something which at the time had seemed so important , so all-important , to have gotten down . And here on this next scrap of paper may be the key lines to some limerick which somebody just had to  --  just simply had to  --  have recorded for himself or herself for posterity . It had seemed that marvelous at the time . . . . But the morning 's full sunlight is upon these things now , and upon the ashes of the former flames , and upon the disarranged chairs where once sat the earth 's grandest mortals . And in cleaning up these things , sweeping away these things  --  these papers , these stubs , these pieces of glass  --  I can feel almost like God may feel when none of us , not one of us , is here on earth anywhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman and child of us . Yet even He may never forget having had us on earth , or the entertainment of having had us . For our fire definitelyis throwing around a lot of fancily colored sparks and streaks and shadows as long as the fire lasts , and as long as we last. 95THE TOWN WITH THE FUNNY NAMEBut the judgment of all this , or the memoirs of all this , will have to await God 's own autobiography . And so , likely enough , we will never get to know for sure. 96CHAPTER 18WHEN THE HEAVIER FOGS COME IN ALONG THIS IMMEDIATE COASTwe usually can see these fogs five or six miles ahead of time . For such a fog forms like a wall out there , and nothingis between us and the moving wall to intercept the vision . There are no trees or buildings out there , but only the surface of the sea , and across this surface the fog bank glides directly at us coming ever closer and more smoothly to submerge us finally . Even the seabirds know what is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the rocks . And we know it , but can do nothing about it except possibly to close our ocean windows . Otherwise the approachingdampness soon will drip through the screens and form pools upon the windowsills . Part of the sky still will be baby blue , even directly above the fog bank . But when ultimately the fog bank , a muffled Juggernaut , finally reaches us and overruns us97THE TOWN WITHthere will he no blue anywhere , and no sky , and even our own hands may assume a strange pallor , and the only noticeable sound will be the distant foghorn on the lighthouseat the base of Point Loma . The foghorn starts up then , as if the first fingers of the fog had sprung the switch automatically . I low many times now , I wonder , have we watched the wall of fog come in like this , and have known ahead of time just what it would do , how it would blind us , and yet how there is no answer for our blindness except to wait . And our most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no vision and no answer , and when only the experience of many years has taught us that . such days will go away again . They will dissolve quite on their own and go away . I feel this is true because the horizon of this ocean seems to be trying to teach it to us all the time , and we who are looking out at this ocean all day long may become peculiarpeople without exactly knowing why . When the sea is kicking up with a storm we ourselves feel disturbed right along with the sea , and yet we do not know just why we are disturbed . Newcomers may look at the foaming rollers and may say : " JeeSUS , what a wonderful sight ! " But the rest of us are not so positive , for a nerve fiber by now seems to connect us with what always is going on out there , all the changes . When the ocean wears a blindfold we ourselves wear a blindfold . And when the ocean delivers the blindfold right at us , and over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being placed back among the as yet unborn . Seeing nothing , we98THE FUNNY NAMEare sure of nothing , and the meaning of life , or the meaning of ourselves , becomes something farther away than ever . But there come other days , and as suddenly , when a freak visibility is such that everything on the sea appears magnified beyond all proportion , when vessels out there appear to be riding high on a scaffolding , and when even the two distant Mexican islands , the Coronados , are so clear-cut , so sharp , and apparently so close to us that with a little imagination we virtually can see the pebbles on the shores there . And now we can feel like wonderful people , tremendous people , people miraculously blessed with eyes and minds capable of seeing and knowing everything . We are not blinded now , and we will not be blinded ever again . Years ago a famous or publicized person to me was someone who had to be interviewed , a stranger , a person apart , a frightening individual . He would talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He never merely conversed . He would be either brusque or he would be too pleasant , too theatrically pleasant ( to us reporters ) , and he still remained somebody from another land , somebody who never was blinded , but somebody who always was certain of himself and of everything . And this would be the way of it with him from now on in . But since then , during these many years , I have seen friends of mine become truly great people , and even as I watched them and knew them and remained friends with them . And only because of this did I finally learn what so many others have known all along , that these few such99THE TOWN WITHfriends can become at times as bewildered and as lost as any of the rest of us . And when they are baffled they are very baffled , yet only to us who are their friends do they dare show it . But to all others they dare not show it , but must remain on an everlasting stage with the curtain alwaysup . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was as awed at interviewing publicizedpeople as I was , now himself becomes **25;3674;TOOLONG so that wherever he goes there are people waiting for him , interviewing him , making demands of him , requesting opinions from him  --  until now at times all he wants , all that his body and mind want , is an evening 's sanctuary with some old-time friend who is not out for anything , and where the drinking is done around the icebox , where the kitchen remains the living room , and where the funny stories are both crude and beautiful  --  but necessary . For the fog bank momentarily has come in for him too . It was not my intention to mention any names in this regard , for of all the obnoxious critters we can have are the name-thrower-outers , and when no other purpose is involved except to be throwing out a name . But there is a purpose here in mentioning one name , Ernie Pyle , and not because he no longer is with us , but because when the fog banks hit him they hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world presumably may have seemed his grape . I have seen Ernie so baffled , so puzzled , so perplexed  --  at these fog banks  --  that he would lie on some cot in agony . The cot might be in some little tent , or the cot mightiooTHE FUNNY NAMEbe in some little room in a Quonset , but he would lie there in agony . At such times he could not sleep , he could not eat , and if he were one who could have cried I am sure that at such times he would have cried . Nor would the fog banks necessarily have concerned his own personal problems , even his own feeling ( later abandoned ) that soon he would be killed . But the fog banks would concern something else , some injustice , the unreasonableness of somethingsomewhere , the insanity he had seen in all the nations , the hopelessness of anything continuing on at all . And while others back home were throwing out solutions over the radio , or otherwise showing how smart they were , Ernie had no solutions whatever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk publicly anywhere  --  except on the one or two times he was tricked into it  --  and in his writing he limited himself always to only that which he saw or knew . Never beyond that  --  never . For beyond that was the fog bank , sometimes coming in , sometimes receding . In San Francisco one morning while we were eating breakfast and preparing to catch a Navy plane together for the Pacific , a reporter asked him : " But , Mr. Pyle , just what is it  --  now  --  you do n't like about war ? " Ernie paled , hurried out to the men 's room , and was sick . He was very sick in there . And yet that reporter may have thought perhaps , the same as Ernie when young on a paper may at one time have thought perhaps , like the rest of us thought , that all famous people must have some answer for everything . Even an answer to that one. ioiCHAPTER 19WE HAVE TWO WORLDS HERE , AND ONE OF THEM IS THE UNDERWATER WORLD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunken . And there is a difference , of course , between looking at them from , for instance , a glass-bottom boat and being down among them with one 's own faceglass and beingas wet as the ocean foliage itself is wet and being swayed about by the underwater drifts . When the foliage sways , one 's body sways too , and becomes a part of the life down there  --  as long as one can hold his breath . Ferns and sea-grass and pretty flowers are down there , and there are paths and arcades and rock gardens , and also ' there are creatures with the world 's most gruesome grace , these creatures being the Moray eels . With their dreadful ease of slithering in and out of hidings , appearing first here then there , then sliding invisibly through the jungle kelp to somewhere else again , they do have such an under-1o2THE TOWN WITH THE FUNNY NAMEwater advantage of us that most of us care for them not at all , and they have become the serpent in our sunken garden . We have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , and more good divers seem to be coming along with each generation , so much so that I no longer consider myself a good diver , although at one period I did consider myself hot stuff indeed . This was about the time when face-glasses first came into use replacingthe old-fashioned goggles , and when not so many guys were diving as are diving now . For we do take a desperatepride in this sort of business , and we have many arguments over who is better than somebody else at doing certain things , whether spearing fish underwater or diving for abalones or even at times diving for the big pismo clams during those unpredictable and rare times when they happen to be around here . Yet as for divers , there always seems to be somebody better than the one who for a while we had thought the best . There always comes along somebody better at divingfor lobsters too . So there is no use of me hoping any more , if merely by mistake , to be known as the crack diver around here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on overhearing the remark : " There goes Miller . He 's our champ . " But now , alas , he is nothing but a has-been , if even that , and with fifteen or twenty feet as his working limit , and getting shyer of Moray eels each day . That 's him . I may like to think age is the whole reason , but it is not the whole reason . For we have fanatics among us now who103THE TOWN WITHcan do things underwater which I never could do , whether young or old . I say this outright because the chaps I go with know it as well as I know it , and I do not want to be kidded by them the same as we kid so many others who keep talking about what great chaps they are , or were , underwater . For diving is a sensitive subject around here among the best divers , and almost a religion , and they are quick to pick up any false note given out in print or otherwise , and I do not blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given out , sometimes in interviews and magazines , and during our gab fests we talk about these errors , and we shake our heads while discussing the errors , as if they were of great importance . But , then , maybe they are of great importance . For everything under the ocean can become of surprisingly great importance , especially to anybody down there trying to time his breath in proportion to the work he has to do . And there always continues to be that big difference betweenlooking down at the things in the ocean and being a living part of them down there , competing against them in their own element . Even a big Moray eel , for instance , might actually appearfascinating instead of God-awful if watched from the surface or through a glass-bottom boat , but not otherwise when the damn thing , as I say , sticks its head out at you as a competitor . Yet I am unaware of the Moray eel being listed in literatureas something to dread . Though we still have listed , of course , and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proverbial shark and the proverbial octopus , neither of which seems to give us much concern around here . At least they are not on our minds ahead of time when underwater , or at least in advance of the time we should happen to see a big one , all of which would be surprisingly rare this close to shore . For our thoughts down there are different than when on the surface . They are quicker and different , and even the fish seem different , now having more the aspect of birds almost , being above us as well as alongside of us , and when the underwater motions of the ocean become like the motions of air or wind , and when most things , including ourselves , seem to be gliding around as if on wings . But the big Moray eel down there is not like anything else , and so I often have wondered , and the other fellows have wondered , why ocean literature has not picked on the Moray as a villain , if merely for its appearance alone , if merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its lack of any sense of humor . The Moray can reach a length of more than five feet , but its proportions when seen underwater can be misleading , for some portion of the eel always is in hiding , and it is always sliding its slimy body through the thickets of the bottom , always cagey enough that when it strikes it will strike at something which is at a disadvantage to strike back , or can not strike back . And when it does strike it strikes not only with its teeth but with its whole body , whipping its body around the object , lashing it and holding it there . Nor am I the only one among us who , while prying at an abalone , has come to the top of the water , 105THE TOWN WITHand stayed on top of the water , when down below an especiallylarge eel has shown its big head too close . Perhaps I am not mentioning Moray eels in the manner scientists might talk about the things while the scientists are around a conference table , and very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Moray eels technically are edible , which technically they are , but I have yet to see any of our own gang eat one of them , or even want to eat one of them , or even want to have anything to do with them on hook or spear  --  if it can be avoided . One of the reasons is , not merely the eel 's appearance , but because it can whip itself into so many knots around the spear or around the hook and sinkers , and there the eel clings , still very much alive and fighting , and still very angry ( they always are angry , even when only prowling ) , and a long , long time is required to cut it off , and get it untangled , and without wrecking one 's whole equipment . But because our opinion of these Moray eels is personal , we occasionally can be at a loss when people on land ask : " But do they ever really attack anybody ? " The answer to this one can be that we try never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatically can hate certain snakes too without actually having been bitten by one . I do not know of a Moray eel ever taking off from out the underbrush of the bottom and deliberately swimmingafter anybody , for this is not the way this eel performs . It sneaks around instead , and as for actually bitinganybody I looked again the other day at Bud 's hand . I wanted to see how the hand was coming along after aio6THE FUNNY NAMElocal doctor had put seven stitches in it , and also after having given Bud a tetanus shot . Bud is a young neighbor of mine , and does as much diving and fishing around here as anybody else , and was born here literally on the edge of the water , and was raised knowing the water knowledge which so many others have had to acquire . The Moray snapped Bud 's hand when Bud was diving for abalones , although around here we have abbreviated the word to " abs , " and Bud described how the eel came to grab him . While underwater with his iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dive , and while still underwater on the same dive was picking them up off the bottom , their white and opensides showing . This is when the eel , sliding out of nowhere , went after one of the abalones at about the same time Bud did , and so the eel and Bud tangled down there , Bud getting the worst of it . Bud said it all could have been his fault , and that from now on he will go for only one abalone at a time . But his hatred of Moray eels is on a par with my own , and so is Perky 's . As for Perky , I would say that the only time I have seen him at a loss what to do was once when we were in his boat together hauling up lobster traps , and when one of the traps suddenly yielded onto the bottom of his boat the largestMoray he or I ever had seen , and we have seen some big ones. 107THE TOWN WITHExactly how big this one was I can not say , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to measure it . But I do know its head appeared to be as large as either Perky 's or mine , although naturally we were prejudiced . But even so , the bigness of the eel must have been one of the factors why it had not escaped from the trap . For ordinarilythese eels can slide their way out of anything , and the slats of a trap or the trap 's top opening , comparatively small though it is , can become as rubber to an eel . But because the ocean had been riled up by a storm this day , we did not see either the trap or the eel inside of it until everything was all too late , and when the trap on a final heave had been tumbled into the boat . The eel got out of the opening then , and all in such a quick movementthat there the eel was inside the boat , and the boat had shipped plenty of water because of the rough sea . These eels , unlike a snake , can not crawl around very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can seem to slide around on anything which is damp and slippery . And here , this time , the eel periodically was in several inches of water , the amount depending on where and on how the boat kept rolling with the sea . Perky and I both yanked our feet off that bottom as fast as we could and stuck them up on the thwarts and gunwaleas high as we could , and wished we could have found something even higher to perch ourselves on . Maybe we did resemble cartoons of ladies avoiding a mouse . But this big Moray was not a mouse , and we did let it have the run of the boat while trying to decide what to do . An oar would have been one of the natural implementsio8THE FUNNY NAMEto grab , but both oars were still secure in their oarlocks , and to reach them would have required considerable fumbling and a change from our highly perched positions , and with the boat meanwhile rolling , and with the big Moray always slithering around so fast that we never knew where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wade down across there and untanglean oar , and neither did I , and then it was that we both thought of his sheath knife . Perky has no reason to know how to throw a sheath knife accurately , for he never practices doing that sort of thing . Nor until now had there ever been any excuse for that kind of melodramatic stuff in his work . But he threw that knife this time , and as hard as he could . I imagine he aimed at the Moray 's head , which would have seemed the instinctive thing to do . But he said afterwards he aimed exactly where the knife went , although I do not believe him . The knife went through the thinner part of the tail and also through a good part of the bottom of the boat , pinning the eel there . We knew now that the boat might start leaking , but we did not much care , at least for the moment . For the eel , with one vicious whip , threw its whole body in a knot around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knife with its teeth . This was good enough for us , providing the knife held , and we both got down off our perches , grabbed the oars out of their oarlocks , and pounded and sliced at that Moray , taking turns doing so because of lack of room . Morays are hard to kill , but we surely battered up this109THE TOWN WITH THE FUNNY NAMEone , and even our oars a little too , for the Moray would grip at the oars the same as at the knife . But when finally we got the heavy sonofabitch hoisted over the side , and out of sight , we were as wilted as two guys could be , and as relieved as well . Our boat the while had been drifting , and was still drifting , but we did not care . We just sat there , leak or no leak. iioCHAPTER 20AND THERE ARE THE SEA LIONS . WHEN A PERSON GETS MY AGEhe should be an authority on something , just anything , even if it is sea lions . But the longer I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being positive about the behavior of the live things in it , although there was one time when I would have laughed out loud if anybody told me that sea lions were not always the harmless animals they are presumed to be . And I remember how I used to be amused by Mickey , a young diver friend of mine , when he would scramble back up into the boat as fast as he could whenever a sea lion would be sighted anywhere in the vicinity . Those were the days of the goggles , and not the faceglasses , and when abalones were more plentiful on the underwater rocks along here than at present . And when fish-and-game wardens , in reverse order , were not as plentiful . Mickey would dive for abalones and sell them , evenIllTHE TOWN WITHthough he had no commercial license for doing so . He usually worked from off a boat not far from The Caves , and whenever I was with him taking care of the oars he would beg me ahead of time : " Now , remember . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would remember and would tell him , nevertheless I alwaysconsidered his plea rather humorous . Besides , my knowledge of sea lions at that time had been more or less limited to the young ones seen in vaudeville and circus acts , and where the animals were billed not as sea lions but simply as seals . Captured young and trained early , they did not include the big bulls with their hundreds of pounds . For I doubt very much if a big bull could be capturedat sea without a lot of difficulty and a lot of special equipment and a lot of profanity . For I do know that even now , in capturing the smaller ones for the San Diego Zoo , quite a bit of paraphernalia is necessary , and quite a bit of profanity , and by the time the special expedition is back from the Coronado Islands , the men in it know they have been out on a real job . And even though no big bulls , or even any middle-sized bulls , were included in the catch . The Zoo 's permission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea lions to be taken at a time from off the near-by Coronados . Yet these two dozen or so cause work enough , the catching being done by a net stretched from fishboat to some jutting rock , the young seals being driven into the net , then hoisted aboard a few at a time by crane . These young sea lions naturally do not like anything112THE FUNNY NAMEabout it . They bite and snarl and cry , and furthermore their whole careers are changed from that moment on . At the Zoo , as soon as they get over their fright and begin to eat again , they are put through preliminary school , so to speak , and finally are traded off to other zoos around the world , or sometimes traded or sold to circuses . As a local animal to be traded for something else , the young sea lion we have around here is especially important to the Zoo . And the young sea lion , once trained , can be an entirely different-minded young sea lion than one which is roaminghis own ocean here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What first may have frightened Mickey about sea lions I do not know . He may have told me , but if so I have forgotten , or did not pay much attention . For this was years ago , and before any of the sea lions , either little or the big bulls , had started playing tag with me while I was swimmingor diving , and before I learned to like no part of them while I was in the water . Nor is this a secret confession . It is quite a public one , as public as Mickey 's used to be . In the same manner and speed with which he used to scramble out of the ocean , should a sea lion be sighted in the vicinity , I now do likewise . Or try to . And all because a few big sea lions from time to time have followed me around , and all because one huge fellow in particular one day would not go away from me at all . He had originated his own game and was playing it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He periodicallywould dive , then come up so as to put his big face113THE TOWN WITHdirectly in front of my own . And there we would be , staringface to face , and with the bull 's ringside weight being six or seven times that of mine . If he had wanted to play so much he should have gone and played with somebody his size . He should have gone and picked on a killer whale . After a while a boat happened to pass within calling distance , and with no pride whatsoever I called over to the people in the boat and said : " You better come over here and let me in . " The boat pulled over , and I got in , the same as Mickey used to do . " What 's the matter ? " they asked . " A damn sea lion , " I said , not caring whether they laughed or not . Just then the bull rose again , showing its massive squarecuthead , typical of bulls , and one of the people in the boat said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it . " Yet his tone had all the difference , all the unmistakable difference , of looking at something big from a boat and looking at something big when down with it in its own element . But again , as in the case of the Moray eels , I do not presumeto know , any more than Mickey knew , all that may be recorded in the ledgers of scientists pro or con in regard to bull sea lions and their relationship to man . Yet the more we are around the ocean , and in the ocean bodily with face-glasses , the more I truly have become convinced that nothing down there behaves according to set rules . For those creatures also can have their own personalities , their own idiosyncrasies , their own peculiar habits , the same as114THE FUNNY NAMEanything on land . And if on some day they may want to do something different than they have done before , or different from what they are supposed to do , they will do it . If sea lions , after having been captured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each have a different personality or temperament , the same as dogs , then I presume the sea lions have the same right to have these differentiations while in their own big ocean . Or if somebody were to come right out blanket-like and say : " But sea lions never hurt anybody , " I have a reply for that one too . It did not happen to me , but it happened to an acquaintance of mine who had been diving for abalonesin front of , and slightly to the north of , one of the largest hotels here , the Casa de Mariana . A big bull went after the diver when he was down under and took a bite out of his back . The diver stabbed the bull with his abalone-iron , and then made his way to shore as best he could . The lifeguardstook care of the diver , giving him preliminary treatmentin the Lifeguards ' Shack , while summoning a doctor . The bull itself floated in later that evening  --  dead . People may say , of course , that the bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but was only playing . Maybe so . But with the aid of old tires and gasoline we burned the bulky body there on the beach , this being the best way to get rid of them . I remember another time , one warm afternoon , when a few of us were sitting around at The Cove talking about this and talking about that , and we were watching with115THE TOWN WITHonly partial interest some stranger who was out in the water floating on his back . We were partially interested because he was so bald-headed , his damp head catching the sun and periodically glistening with it . But the stranger seemed at such perfect peace out there , floating around and looking up at the sky , that I remember one of us made some comment about him and his bald head while wondering how long he intended to continue floating on and on like that . And even while we were watching and wondering these things , a sea lion must have been doing much the same from underwater . We did not see the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in back of the man , and next to his head , and gave the bald head a swat with a flipper . Two of the lifeguards sprinted through the water out to the man , then , thinking he might become panicky . But he did not know what had hit him until we told him , and then he hardly believed us . For the sea lion immediately had gone underwater again . And the reason it all could have been considered funny , I suppose , was simply because the man was so bald-headed . Newcomers continue to be more indifferent about sea lions than we are , or like Mickey was , or like I am , and mainly because , I suppose , they have learned or read no reason to be otherwise . They may be cautious ahead of time about such things as sharks , for instance , which the rest of us pay no concern . But as for seals  --  ah , they always have been pictured as such cute friendly little things . And I was reminded again of this indifference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expecting to land , came close into shore at The Cove , and in the middle of a group of new Sunday swimmers there . Mickey or I or a lot of the rest of us would have gotten out of there fast . But these new people did not seem to mind , and they stayed watching in the semi-shallow water while the sea lion maneuvered among them . The result was this brief news-item in The San Diego Union of next day : A seal swam into the bathing area of La Jolla Cove yesterday , brushed against a 2i-year-old girl swimmerand inflicted an injury on the bather 's left elbow with one of its flippers . ( Girl 's name ) was treated at the La Jolla Police station , said the seal swam over her after she had dived into the water . This story , though accurate in substance , is not altogetheraccurate in detail . For the sea lion bumped the girl in her back , and she is not sure whether the injury was caused by a flipper or by teeth or what . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her first . But her indifference , and the indifference of the new people around her when the seal was there , is what still amazes the rest of us . All she said was that the seal , while rubbing across her , " felt awfully slimy . " Mickey would have burst a blood vessel . Before I became like Mickey , and learned to dislike being in the water when sea lions were around , I tried to117THE TOWN WITHmake a pet of a young one which each day used to climb up into Perky 's rowboat moored out there . The young sea lion would half-leap and half-climb into the boat , and stay there sunning itself on one of the thwarts . I would swim out to the boat , then , and gradually day by day made myself acquainted . By not trying to rush the acquaintanceship I finally was able to climb up into the boat and sit at one end with the sea lion staying at the other . The little sea lion did not like me there . I could tell that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to mind me there , either . Yet I was working for the day when I could move right over alongside of it , and perhapsbegin petting it , and the fellows on the beach could then say what an animal-trainer I was . Days followed days , and I was getting along pretty good with my act , actually in time being able to sit alongside the seal . But each time I tried to pet it , it would cry and snarl . Somebody told me later that seals do not mind being patted as much as they hate being stroked . But I did not know this then , even if it is true , and so I kept on trying for the day when I could stroke the seal , and even began bringing out dead fish to the boat as a further lure . But nothing doing . The seal neither would eat my fish nor let me put my hand upon its body . And then one day , when I was especially anxious to show off to some friends , and was nearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea lion broke all precedent by suddenly jumping from the boat into the water , thereby ruining my performance . I was feeling bad about this , myii8THE FUNNY NAMEpride as an animal-trainer hurt , when  --  whang ! The seal , like an underwater torpedo ( for a seal is remarkably streamlined when swimming under the surface ) , took after me and swished under my feet . I can not swear that the seal touched me , for too much unexpected was happening all at once . But I do like to come to the conclusion that the seal , having had a bellyful of my eagerness to touch it , was now showing me in turn what it is like to be touched by a foreign substance , and for me from now on to mind my own business . Perky , who saw it happen , said that the seal could have been coming after the bass in my hand . But this does not seem to make as much sense as the other . For the seal could have had the bass anyway , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IS THE GARIBALDI , golden and numerous and brave . Each has for its home some rocky castle , somewhat similar in shape to the smaller ones in a fishbowl , and the fish hangs around outside its doorway and looks up at us as we swim over . And we would miss it considerably if suddenly it were not here any more . We do not spear or catch the Garibaldi . For one thing , the Garibaldi is too smart to take a hook , as for instance a hook meant for other fish . But as for spearingthe Garibaldi , this is the sure sign of a newcomer and a novice . For the rest of us would as soon spear one of our own domestic pets , and it would be as easy to do . The Garibaldi , golden as new gold , is not a large fish as ocean fish go . Nor is it always a small one . A fair length would be ten inches perhaps , but the body is exceptionally thick and round in proportion , and the Garibaldi with120THE TOWN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the ones this time in an aquarium and always seems eager to study us , even to making mental notes on us as we swim over and around . Yet if we come too close , the fish again will back up into its doorway and peer out at us from there , and with only its head showing . The Garibaldi protects its underwater castle against other Garibaldi , or against other intruders its size , and I imagine they may quarrel quite a bit among themselves , one house-owner quarreling with another . But this is not our concern , and when they look up at us they sometimes swim almost upright to do so . The Cove still has as many Garibaldi now as when first I came here a quarter-century or so ago . And sometimes when we of The Cove are far away , or have been far away , perhaps on hot dry land somewhere far away , and think of The Cove , so cool at home , and think of swimming and looking down at its green rocky bottom , we automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and behavingas smartly and as independently as ever it did . I know for a fact how this memory picture goes , not merely for myself , but with others . For we have talked about it afterwards and we have agreed : " By God , that 's right . " And we have talked about it a little even when we have run into each other elsewhere , in some city or some land which is not here , and when we say : " How 'd you like to be back in The Cove right now ? " For this is one convenient thing about the Garibaldi in The Cove , they do not need a caretaker while we are away . They do not have to be fed or left with neighbors or put into a kennel or taken out for exercise or have sand-121THE TOWN WITHboxes supplied for them or have veterinaries pick foxtails out of their skin . And yet in a way the Garibaldi most definitely belongs to us whether we are here or not . People inland may remember from childhood their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written about such memories , and how when they returned as eldersto these old holes they did not seem nearly as large or nearly as steep . But in this regard The Cove never can becomea disappointment like that , even to the youngsters born here . For The Cove is the ocean , and looks directly out upon the rest of the ocean , and it is hard to have an ocean appear any smaller no matter how old we may becomeor no matter how long the lapse of time since last we saw it or were in it . And I like to think that the Garibaldi , should any of them go wandering over other parts of the sea , could become as homesick for The Cove as we can . And would remember their own underwater castles there , and with us funny creatures always entertaining them from above . " Yep , something was always doing at The Cove , " they could say , the same as we say . Only twice in all these years have I seen anybody spear a Garibaldi at The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beach was the same and his own conductwas the same . Each of the two men ( though the incidentswere years apart ) waded proudly back up onto the sand , the live Garibaldi on display on his spear and strugglingabout on it . The newcomer , apparently expecting to be admired as a great spearman , a great one-day wonder on his first time out , waved the spear around slightly so we would be sure to see. 122THE FUNNY NAMEBut nobody on the beach moved or said a word . The silencewas such that the bloke himself , if he had any wave length at all , must have realized he had done something wrong , and even though there is not much law against what he had done . Except , of course , the greatest law of all. 123CHAPTER 22THERE IS ENOUGH VANITY IN ALL OF US PERHAPSto want a hometown to remember us , even slightly , and some can do this by donating a flagpole or a fountain or a set of chimes or maybe the uniforms for the high school band . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Caves , for at present they are known merely as The Caves . Professional pictures are taken of them , and these pictures are published in magazines , newspapers , guidebooks , and whenever we see any of these pictures we have reason to think : " Ah , The Caves have picked up in business . But The Caves have not picked up in business , at least very much , and mainly , I think , because no noticeable legends have been created around them . There is , to be sure , one legend which struggled for life for a while , and may still be struggling , for I remember once having seen124THE TOWN WITH THE FUNNY NAMEit in a California guidebook ; the legend being credited to some old Indian folk tale that The Caves were gouged out by an ancient Indian chief during a spell of anger . He gouged them out by blows with his bare fists because an Indian princess would not return his love . This legend at least shows a try , and should be given a fielder 's credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rest of us have done for The Caves , except to take them for granted . But what The Caves really need is either a murder or a miracle . And if it is to be a miracle , then it should be like those miracles they have in France or Italy , so that the ocean salt water inside The Caves could henceforth be known to do something to people who drink it . Or if it is to be a murder , then it should be a royal one , say of a beautiful Spanish queen captured from off a Spanishgalleon while en route back to her homeland from the Philippines . She was captured by the English privateers who used to cruise around here capturing Spanish galleons en route to Mexico or their homeland from the Philippines , and she refused to tell her capturers where she had hidden her jade-studded stomacher of great value . So , the privateers encased the queen within The Caves until she would tell , and the body of the poor queen is still encased within The Caves , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or maybe she is not really dead , and the moan of the surf inside The Caves is not actually the moan of the surf inside The Caves . Yes , something immortal should be written about The Caves , and soon , and Perky also is of the same opinion. 125THE TOWN WITH " Holy hell , yes , " he said . For now all he can do from his rowboat is show The Caves . He may be satisfied with them , but his few and irregular customers may not always be as satisfied . For all they can do is look at them . The Caves are not deep nor are they dark nor are they wide , but they are high , perhaps a hundred feet or so high , and shaped like cathedral entrances . But no stalagmites or stalactites are inside The Caves , and the floors are covered only by ocean-washed rocks , the same kind of ocean rocks one can see anywhere , and during high tides the sea slaps into the entrances . Cormorants by the hundreds roost on the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the cormorantsapparently have been roosting there through the centuries , nevertheless cormorants are not romance . And what Perky needs for The Caves is romance . We all need it for The Caves . We need romance with sacrifice and broken hearts . A long time ago , perhaps fifty years ago , a professional high-diver named " Professor "  --  well , " Professor " somebody  --  didthe best he could for The Caves by diving off the top of the cliff from a scaffolding above them . It was a great dive , he did it on Fourth of July , and received twenty-five dollars for it . But the first trouble seems to be that he did not make his leap a thousand years ago , and the second trouble seems to be that he was not a virgin maiden joining her gods . Also the " Professor "  --  I recall his name now  --  " Professor " Poole lived to be quite an elderly man , finally dying in San Diego in 1943 , almost half a century afterwards , 126THE FUNNY NAMEand another reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn twenty-five dollars . It is not that The Caves need a press agent . It is not that . For visitors from everywhere seem to know about The Caves ahead of time , and want to see them . But it is the visitors ' letdown after seeing The Caves which is the currentproblem . Nor is there anything in The Caves which can be stolen as a keepsake , unless one wants to lug out one of the heavy stones , and he is welcome to do that . Or he can pick up a similar kind anywhere else . Or if he wants to write his name and hometown on the walls he can do that likewise , and the ocean will scrub them off again . But if he wants to tell about The Caves afterwards , about all he can do is say that : " Yes , I saw them . " For all that they have , actually , is a natural beauty . A small curio store is on the curving street above The Caves , and the store is doing the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is by displaying a street sign , " Entrance To The Caves , " and stating the store 's own admission price by way of an artificial entrance down through a hole in the floor of the store . An owner or somebodyassociated with the store created at one time this idea by digging a tunnel-like stairway down through the dirt and the rocks , and ending down near the natural entrance by the ocean . Perky knew the man who did all this painstaking work , but I do not know him . Nor do I even know what the admissionreads , maybe a dime , maybe a quarter . For I never have gone through the commercial entrance the right way . I have , though , gone through the commercial entrance the127THE TOWN WITH THE FUNNY NAMEwrong way , and it was a mean thing to do . It was mean to the person running the store . All this was quite a while ago , and I was not alone in the guilt . Perky was with me , and also a former lifeguard on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming in the vicinity of The Caves when the former lifeguard suggested that we swim . into one of The Caves  --  the one containing the artificial stairway  --  and climb it . We did . We swam , then waded our way into this cave , then climbed onto the dry rocky platform which is the base of the stairway , and we walked up it . In our wet swimmingtrunks , and with our bodies still dripping , we emerged up inside the curio store through the floor opening , and unfortunately just as a group of paying visitors were about to descend . On seeing how wet we were , and presuming apparently that this must be what happens to everybody who goes down into this cave , the visitors had logic in demanding back their paid admissions . While the three of us continued silently on through the curio store and out upon the street , the curio manager was in the act of returning the money . But we did not wait , nor have we returned . Yet all of this may be just one more reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both to the keeper of the curio store and to The Caves themselves , by producing a glorious fable . The fable might win me my name on a plaque , and some sightseer to The Caves could then steal the plaque. 128CHAPTER 23SAN DIEGO , AND NOT HERE , IS WHERE THE CONVENTIONS ARE HELD . And so about the only times we of this small town are aware of these conventions are when the delegates , or some of them , are taken on sightseeing tours in chartered busses out to see us . The busses stop at this point or that point along our coast , everybody gets out , everybody looks around for a while , everybody gets back into the busses again and everybodygoes away . But we can tell they are conventioneers because of the caps or the badges or the colored raiment the visitors are wearing . We may be , then , part of the program too , and even may be included in the minutes of the last meeting . But beyond all this I sometimes think that many of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without realizing what they are . For we may not be geographically together when we have them. 129THE TOWN WITHWe may be far away from each other , very far away , in different cities , different states , maybe even on different continents . Often I have wondered about this , and have wondered if it could be true . For all at once , and almost as if an informal gathering were taking place , I will be thinking of certain people , several of them at once , certain friends , and we will all be together , all moving around , all laughing or kidding each other about something , or all serious about something which in itself is serious . But just what it is , is never quite clear . But our bondage one to the other seems not only clear but definitely precise , and it appears to go beyond the bondage of the more ordinary initiation rituals . It could have been that we have helped bury some mutual friend in the dusty coral of a distant and tiny island . It could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duringa strike by the Kamikaze . It could have been that we were in the same pyramid tent , with the rain deluging us from all directions , sideways and upwards as well as downwards , while preparing to move on our next operation which we knew would be a dilly . Or our bondage could have been any one quick moment which , in the electricity of its quickness , welded us together as no ordinary bondageever could do . But whatever it is , or wherever it was , we are members of our own lodge now . And there may be many such lodges , countless such lodges , intertwined throughout this country or world of ours . Nor in recognition of our peculiar affinity13oTHE FUNNY NAMEdo we have to meet once a year or wear funny hats or be incorporated . We do meet , though . I am sure of it . We keep on meetingat the most unexpected times , almost on the order of a come-as-you-are party , or perhaps , and more equally true , a come-as-you-were party  --  meaning the faces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bygone . We have our own password as well , and one which is passed between us only from the mind to the mind , and with no official acknowledgment of same being necessary . It is receipt enough to feel the password being both receivedand given . Some of our members may be known exceedingly well for what they did , or some may not be known  --  outside this club . But inside this club their membership means everything . Maybe some of them are still doing great things . Yet that does not matter . What matters is the memory of how this or that individual at some time , perhaps some split second , did what most desperately needed to be done , and when nobody else could have done it . It is as if he could have been born just for that one decisive moment , or that one decisive day , or that month or week  --  and for the good of all of us . So our club , which saw it being done , retains a loyalty to that individual which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bad or nothing . For within a single vital hour he had more magnificence perhaps than can be found in all his current-day censors combined , and no matter how long they may live. 131THE TOWN WITHToday when some outsider , some non-member of the club , may say in front of other people : " I saw that friend of yours when I was in Philadelphia a couple weeks ago . God was he drunk , "  --  it is not the words which cause us to bristle so much as the manner in which they are said . For this outsider , by his misplaced laugh , must now be presumingthat everything is equaled up again , and that he is now on a par with our own man , our own member . True , on getting back here after his long absence in the nether world , our member may not always have conducted himself in a way which the immediate world would considersmartly for himself . That is , he failed to be all things in one . He failed to live that world and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the successful tricks of the here as well as of the there . And providing that some honors or some medals or some publicity were given to him during a brief span of his return , this makes the situation all the more pronounced for him , and presumablyhe has been given a headstart . But he has not been given a headstart . Instead , he has been placed on the spot , and this means he must meet the demands of censors and press alike . The money-makers would judge him only if he immediately knows how to make money the same as they can . Or others will judge him only if he immediately becomes a professional speaker , a town 's organizer , a politician , an idol of all women 's clubs , an actor at heart , and all of this in addition to what he really had been . And because by now he may have failed to be any or all132THE FUNNY NAMEof these , and despite the " headstart , " then our man is no good , never has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be too . Yet of just such people remain the grandest memories and members of our club , our club which always is strangely meeting  --  I know it is  --  and without first having to have convention notices sent around . But now with another holocaust coming up , these people ( only younger ones this time ) will be in demand again as soon as the holocaust strikes . They will be in demand again to do the impossible , the too few for the so many , when the land 's supposedly greatest brains are running around in confusion , and when once again they are bawling : " Oh , why does n't somebody do something about it  --  oh , why did n't somebody do something about it  --  oh , why does n't somebody go out and stop those enemy bastards  --  before anything happens to ME ! " And then it will be the same record all over again , and always and only during an emergency . There will be anotherJimmy , there will be another Jocko , there will be another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slugging it out while the erstwhile smarty-pants at home are still wringing their hands . And will continue wringing their hands , since in an emergency this seems all they are capable of doing . Having been in two wars I should be used to it by now , and the supercilious attitudes afterwards towards our Jimmies and our Jockos and our " Pappies . " I should be133THE TOWN WITHused to it , and the aftermath when all is safe again , except that it is impossible for me to get used to this aftermath , these criticisms , these eye-raisings , these smartcracks , by the jolly stay-at-homes , these guys who think of their own financial success and futures first of all  --  unless their own sacred little bodies should suddenly be in danger at home too late . " I saw that friend of yours the other day , and God was he drunk . " There might not be the opportunity for this statement as one of the aftermaths next time . For , as dreadful as the fact may seem , we have yet to imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this earth without these horrors actually happening . And some lulus not only have been imagined but also have been predicted for this next one coming up . If one war can produce by surprise the V-1 , the V-2 , and then the atom  --  then how can any of us hope this next time that what will happen will not happen . And also this next war , as with the beginning of all wars , started before the last one ended . And we who have seen the build-up of two other wars recognize the same old pattern . We may be older , but the pattern has not changed . It starts with some strong country becoming too secret and too cunning and too coy  --  so coy that with one hand it reaches for gifts of sympathy and with the other hand , the one behind its back , it turns these gifts into whatever it feels like turning them into , namely war equipment , and " do n't look now , we 're a very sensitive people , and you 'll offend us. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now  --  once with the Japs and two times with the Germans  --  how can I help but feel what I feel . Nor for my own convictions must I any longer first run around interviewing other people ( memoirs of old reportorial days ) for their opinions . For having seen the build-up of two wars ( three wars actually ) , and having been the participant of two wars ( three wars actually ) , I now have as much reason for recognizing this feeling  --  this feeling of mine  --  as they do . And for expecting the worst , even the worst against our own countrywhich already happens to be divided against itself , and with so many of our own people already siding with the potential enemy , and bragging about it . Yet , after having seen far too many of our own Americanyoungsters getting mauled around , chopped up , I would be a heel not to mention somewhere in this book what I am thinking . But , having expressed it , I will quit now and go back to this other business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hometown , on the Pacific . This little town where conventioneers come out and look at us , but where some of us in turn have our own holy and mysterious gatherings  --  with those few precious guys the world around. 135CHAPTER 24ONE CAN READ ALL THE PHILOSOPHY HE LIKES ABOUT GOODNESS AND LIGHT , BUTstill the day may come when this town will know me as Killer Miller , he with the Icy Eye . And my killing days generally will be on holidays , Saturdaysand Sundays . On these days , and with a shotgun across my lap , I will sit on my ocean steps and glower . Like the prairie Sioux or Blackfeet or Piegan I will sit and glower at the white race which , coming out in hordes from nowhere , is now making extinct the food supply of us natives . Because of my killings , all of us of the town sooner or later may be placed on a reservation . But we will have to be caught first and taken alive . And there on the reservation in years to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asked if it is really true that I can remember as far back as when abalones actually were found on the underwater rocks136THE TOWN WITH THE FUNNY NAMEaround here . My reply will be a grunt in the affirmative , but my beady eyes will still retain the hatred which now is beginning to possess me each time I see a new crowd of emigrants swarming over our ocean rocks and slaughtering our shellfish on them  --  just to be slaughtering something . There is supposed to be a limit of ten abalones a day to each person , and this is far more than any single person can eat in a week , or maybe even a month , abalones being that rich when prepared and cooked properly . But limit or no limit , the devastation during the past two years has become such that today we natives see more empty shells than we see living ones , and they require many years to grow to a decent size , a size convenient for handling , a legal size of six inches or so . But whereas the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herds around from season to season , from one feeding grounds to another , we can not convenientlydo that with the abalone . When they are gone they are gone . Besides , they do not roam . The situation has gotten so now that whenever I see a pair of swimfins go down underwater I pray that the diver will come up empty handed . That is , unless the swimfins belong to me and I am the diver . For , many new apparatuseshave come into being during my time , and all designedapparently to make our local abalone extinct as soon as possible . In the old days it used to be sufficient for us to swim out with a pair of goggles , and come back with two or three abalones stuck inside our swimming trunks . This would be well and enough for a meal . But today the pursuit has137THE TOWN WITHbecome glorified with face-glasses , inner tubes , rubberboats , swimfins , surfboards , and the largest crowd each party can muster together for scouring the bottom for any lone abalones which may remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All that will help is for me to become a killer . The abalone already has enough natural enemies besidesman 's converted tire-irons for getting between the shell and the rock for prying . Having only this one protectiveshell , the abalone is a wide-open victim for anything in the sea once this shell has been pried off the rock and the white living meat is exposed . The eels will be there in no time , and so will the lobsters if they can get by the eels . That big-toothed fish , the sheepshead , can pry off an abalone anyhow , once the sheepshead gets its teeth hooked under a medium-sized shell . Or even the starfish , by remaining determined day after day , can stay clamped around an abalone until it gives up too . This should be enough enemies . But I have seen groups of strangers diving for abalones , then deliberately tossing them up into the air and back into the ocean again , and just to be showing off . Sometimes this is done when the abalone , after having been pried free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether undersized or legalsized , the abalone is doomed anyway . It will hardly have time to get its open side turned around , and clamped back onto some rock , before the eels or other enemies will make a rush for it . Of all the shellfish I ever have encountered , the abalone , I think , comes the nearest to having a brain . The abalone , 138THE FUNNY NAMEin its attempts for self-defense , is sensitive to lights and shadows and excessively sensitive to touch . The abalone seems aware of all that is going on , and aware of all the things which are out to get it . The abalone will tighten even when its own rock is touched , or when a shadow comes too close . But the poor little fellow has to stay relaxed once in a while , for only in this way can it absorb food . Once Perky and I were out in my own rubber boat when a strange thing happened . It was one of those things which require witnesses to be believed . Or rather an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sound . The sound easily could be analyzed , of course , as simply being two shells scraping together . But the word the sound gave off was what startled us both , for we both heard it , and both stared at each other to make sure we both heard it . We had been out getting some abalones for our own meal , and were returning to shore with four of them . We had left them clustered and clinging and moving together on the bottom of the boat , as they always do when struggling to get clamped onto something again , if merely clamped upon themselves . And the sound which startled us was like the metallic sound of one of those toy wires which , when scraped by the thumb-nail , say " Merry Christ-mas . " But this metallic-like sound from the abalones did not say " Merry Christmas . " It said , and all too distinctly , and with what should be printed in tiny plaintive letters : murder-r . " Did you hear what I heard ? " I asked Perky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be god-damned. " 139THE TOWN WITH THE FUNNY NAMEIf this had occurred during those ages when fables were becoming immortalized about princesses and dragons and mermaids and talking fish , the abalone naturally should have continued by pleading for its life and granting us three wishes if we returned it safely to the sea again . And not by just tossing it back in , but by putting it back on a rock . . . . But enough of that . For when I see this waste going on with the destruction of abalones , especially when it is going on over what used to be my own little abalone patch in front of my own home , my own anger actually startles me as much as this sound startled me . There are so many things in the world to be angry about , why , then , should I let this particular anger predominate ? I have tried to reason it out , and there is no reason , other than the primitive one which has its source supposedly with food . But I could hold a war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could burn out their stomachs . I could put splinters in their eyes , and turn them over for further treatment to my fiendish squaws . I could set flame to the car caravans in which these people arrive , and I could leave them wandering lost and stark naked in the snow , except that we have no snow . Hate is a strange item , all right . But now I also know what it is . It is when somebody else gets what we want for ourselves. 140CHAPTER 25WE WERE SITTING AROUND OUTDOORSTHE OTHER EVENING , RAY AND I , and for some reason we started talking about kid memories . This may not be smart to do , especially in this town , since such talk could be a sign that we also have joined the troupe of the aged for sure . Or , instead of talking about it , we could say to ourselves : " Well , that 's all in the bygone . Forget it . " But nothing , after all , is really in the bygone , so long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as our bodies have saturated some incident , some moment , some occasion , and the more personal they have been the more attached they have become to our physical being . They are a part of us now , and only an amputation  --  a complete loss of memory  --  could sever them away . Otherwise we are bound to live with them always , the same as with the rest of our appendages . Or , if we cared to put it this way , we mathematically141THE TOWN WITHcould take our memories , multiply them by our years , and in a sense we could have the sum total of ourselves . Sometimes I wish though , just for fun , that we could have been more people than we have been . Or could have lived more boyhoods besides our own . For only too often can our own memories become too pat , too framed , especially with the telling of them . And we will be finding ourselves in time reciting some neat little story which in its actuality had not been neat at all , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in some form or other right up to now  --  still looking for an end . I may have hinted about this somewhere before , but it all leads up to something else , something which may or may not be a clue to why some of our friends always remaininteresting , no matter how long we have known them . It may be because they have not shot everything they knew in one bright impression . For all of us during our years , no doubt , have entertained people who in one burst of glory have exploded all their wares during one amazing evening , and without us knowing all their wares have been exploded . So , we say to ourselves : " Ah , there 's a smart person . We should get together more often . " So we do get together again , and the meeting becomes nothing but a repeat performance of the whole previous repertoire , and we sit there blaming each other for the boredom . Now , I have known Ray for many , many years , and duringthese many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . But not until this other evening did I ever know that as a kid he once lived on an ostrich farm. 142THE FUNNY NAMEThis is one of the things that I , for instance , might have told anybody right away on a first meeting . I might have rung in the subject as soon as possible , as often as possible , and under the faintest excuse . For the ostrich farm was a bona fide . It was just outside of Phoenix . His father , who knew nothing about ostriches , had bought the farm , had moved the family there , and had tried to make a living out of it . Ray said that the ostriches were about the dumbest things he ever knew , and that the farm finally went broke on the day a lot of the ostriches killed themselves by gettingtheir necks stuck in the wire fence . The ostriches took on mass hysterics when a small dog came into the pen , and there was no way of saving the ostriches after this happened . Ray , though , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired of collecting old bones for the ostriches to eat . He said that , as a kid , one of his jobs was to go around the desert picking up animal skeletons , and grinding them into ostrich food  --  and then all at once he stopped talking about ostriches . One of the reasons he may have stopped talking was because I , not wanting to be left out of things , started in on one of my own hard-luck stories as a kid . So he patiently listened , then , while I told about one of my Christmases on the prairie , the time when we received our family Christmas box from the Coast a month early . We had driven the team into Conrad , Montana , for the mail , a day 's trip in and a day 's trip out again . The Christmas box , with a gift for each of us , was in the mail . We put the box143THE TOWN WITHon the floor inside the one-room shack , and stared at the box for a month while waiting for Christmas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insideof it being a little football , one of those fluffy kinds which at that time cost perhaps fifty cents . Immediately I blew up the football with my mouth , and was very happy , and went outside with the ball to kick it . There being no other kids anywhere within miles around to whom I could kick the ball , I merely kicked it up into the air as if to myself . The ball landed upon a pin-cushion cactus , and there in one kick went my Christmas . I know I must have told the episode to Ray before , becausesurely I must have told it to somebody , because the telling came out too easily . But again he laughed with a patient laugh , and then told another completely new story of his own . He said that one of his oddest experiences as a kid occurred on a Fourth-of-July right here in our near-by San Diego . He said he had gotten a job in a small grocery store owned and operated by an elderly woman . She had just started the store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fireworks . She had stocked up with about three hundred dollars worth of them , but when Fourthof-Julycame around , and was nearly over , by closing time she had sold practically none of them . In disgust she gave them all to her hired boy , who was Ray , to do with as he liked . " Three hundred dollars worth of fireworks , " Ray said . " And all mine . But have you ever tried to shoot off three144THE FUNNY NAMEhundred dollars worth of fireworks by yourself , and all at the end of one day ? That could be a hard-luck story too . " What I now could do , of course , would be to take over his stories , and make believe from now on that they are mine . And in years to come I would be finding myself reciting them back to him . But I do believe he patiently would listen just the same . And this is what I mean by a friend. 145CHAPTER 26AH , YES , I TOO KNOW THE MEANING OF LUST . LUST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big southeasterly ( our biggest storms come from the southeast ) and when every piece of driftwood being driven upon the beach belongs by rights to me . For the driftwood here is not what it would be if this were a timbered country . We have trees around here now , to be sure , but at sometime or other most of them have been planted . This land originally was what could be called a desert country , a desert between our coastline and the nearest mountains , the Lagunas , in the distant background . Some natural oaks are up there , some naturalpines , and some other trees . But even so they rarely comprise a forest , as forests generally are known elsewhere . Nor do we have any large rivers or even any allyearstreams to deliver the trunks down to the sea to us . This means that when we who live along the ocean want146THE TOWN WITH THE FUNNY NAMEto get our own wood we have to get it from out the ocean . This means , also , that the wood at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or spiked , and comes to us secondhandedly  --  whenever it comes to us . Driftwood is supposed to be a romantic word . But around here  --  unless I am the one getting all of it  --  driftwoodis synonymous with greed . In my fires I have burned nothing but driftwood . Yet driftwood appears to have seasons too , the same as anything else in the ocean . An extreme plus tide may free the wood from somewhere else to bring it to us . Or a heavy westerly may bring in the wood from the kelp beds where it has been lodged . But usually it is a mighty southeasterly , and not a westerly , which does the trick , which wrecks things , which tears out pilings , which causes difficulty to others  --  merely that the wood may come to ME . But on those special days I have to work fast . Or others will get the wood too . I do not mind so much if they get the little splinters , the broken crates , or even the water-logged numbers which are too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried out they go puff , and that is the only fire in them . They are through . But give me some wrenched-out plank or some creosoted piling , which my enemies covet , and there is no feeling quite like it . These are the moments when I can glory in my lust . These are the moments likewise , while working with my axe , when my only fear is that somebody else has found a similar piece around a bend . For so many years now have I been stalking this shorelinefor whatever I can find that the pride in my findings147THE TOWN WITHmay have become all out of focus . This must be a fact , but still I am helpless against it . Too many years of greed have left their mark . Let me see something , except on the beach , and this something may be nothing but outright trash . But let me see the same thing washed up on the beach and this thing becomes surrounded by a mysterious halo . I investigate it , and it has to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second consideration before abandoning it or lugging it home . The gulley next my home where I store my loot is my treasure warehouse . And yet , except for the driftwood , I doubt if there is a single item in this treasury which I would have accepted if somebody had offered it to me , if somebody had said : " Here it is , take it home with you . " Once I did a hell of a thing , but it demonstrates this beach lust , and how quickly we can get back into the groove . While being assigned one time from Pacific waters to European waters , or it could have been vice versa , my orders called for me to report through the Eleventh Naval District , San Diego . This allowed a day or so at home , and a repacking of the different kind of uniforms necessary for the next assignment . But I wanted to go down on my own beach , of course , if merely for a few minutes , and so I changed into the customaryold tennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . And these old days , the old association of ideas , snapped right back , and so fast , that I completely forgot I was a big boy now and in a war . I forgot it the moment a towing target was shot off in practice from a Navy towingplane , one of my own Navy towing planes . The hollow148THE FUNNY NAMEsleeve , a long worm wiggling headfirst down through the sky , landed among some ocean rocks not many yards from me . If that sleeve had landed on land I would have paid no attention , having seen hundreds of sleeves land after beingshot away , and having seen hundreds of sleeves anyhow , and not having given a particular damn about any of them , they had become so common in my life . Or if I had wanted an old one , full of bullet holes like this one undoubtedly was , all I would have had to do perhaps was ask for it , and would have been considered crazy doing so . But this sleeve , having landed among the ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lust of old came right back . I no longer was an officer . I was a guy in old clothes once more stalking my own shoreline , and that sleeve by rights was meant for me , and even if I had no possible use for it . Two sailors from the near-by target station , though , arrived just then in a Navy jeep and began looking for the towing sleeve . They climbed down the cliff to the sands and began looking everywhere . They had been sent from the station to recover the sleeve and return it . This was obvious . But I kept silent . I knew where the sleeve was hidden , but as long as I could  --  two minutes , three minutes , four minutes  --  I kept silent . And that silence , sir , has come to my mind afterwards as having been as low and as lustful and as pointless as any beach-hunter ever can get just out of habit . Well , maybe not . Maybe I do not yet know the total depth to which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WITHDriftwood requires no bookkeeping . The arrivals never are registered in a ledger . But if they were , the one golden star which possibly could be awarded me for good conduct is the fact that so far I have not collected more wood than I can burn . This is because I can not find more wood than I can burn . The stock may be high immediately after storms . But during calms , down the stack goes , down and down . Or if I would like to dream up an allegory about myself keeping watch on this shore for all new arrivals , the props should include a robe of scarlet , a cloven hoof , and an evil leer . For the driftwood then would not be driftwood as such , but the grotesque shapes of lost mortals being tossed up to me , or down to me , for their final fate  --  a fate which is sealed the instant they are in my power . As if the ocean and the world already had not done enough to them , they are now going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my pleasure . Yes , some of the shapes , to be sure , have the appearance of already having undergone every conceivable torture . Their sinews have been twisted with rusty nails , pieces of their frames have been wrenched off , some come bound and helpless in the thongs of sea-grass , and crowns of sharp barnacles have been thrust upon them . They are a sorry lot . On earth they could have held the wrong beliefs duringthe wrong year . But this is not my worry . My worry is to grab them , to stack them , and then hope for another batch to come in . My worry also is how to get them up the steep cliff somehow . And then it is that I wish I could make them tramp15oTHE FUNNY NAMEup by their own effort , up past my reviewer 's stand , and on up to the fiery altar of their own execution . I would like that . It would make me feel I was somebody . And likewise I would like to make them salute me as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are about to perish , to salute the one through whose bountiful love they are about to be returned to their original elements via smoke and ash . But my would-be allegory , I realize , is becoming all mixed up , as mixed up as everything else in religion and history . I had , then , better stick to my own lust which I do understand. 151CHAPTER 27NEVER DID I THINK THE DAY WOULD COME IN THIS TOWN WHENI would be guilty of putting up a sign : " Private Property  --  No Trespassing . " I glance at the new sign , and still hardly can believe that it is mine , and that it is necessary . But the sign , even though it may or may not do any good , is necessary , I am told . The sign is on the stairway we ourselves have just finisheddigging and building down through the cliff to the stony beach . The stairway is anything but elaborate , and anything but foolproof . And if the sign is not on it , according to the warning given me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get hurt monkeying around the stairway , or climbing it , possibly to picnic in my own yard . " Private Property  --  No Trespassing " comprise without doubt the ugliest words tomed by man . Yet .. ny words short of these , so I am told again , would not meet the legal152THE TOWN WITH THE FUNNY NAMErequirements . I have tried to think of other words , nicer words like " please " and " kindly respect , " but they will not do . They would still leave me responsible , and that is the tough part about it . But the sign , which I do hate so much , could for a fact influence my life if I keep looking at the words . For I feel now that I may have to live up to them . This means that I may have to start acting the part of somebody who really does presume to own , as if for all time , a definite something which is his alone . And if this is the case I will have to stop trespassing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ createdat some time or other for the pleasure of all of us . I will have to stop remembering certain lines of great poetry . I should not be entitled to look at other people 's writings of long ago . Excellent paintings should not be for me to see unless I buy them . I should not catch myself humming some ancient tune . For all of these , and more , have been given to us by some individual 's own work . They did not just come into being by themselves like a sunset or a Sequoia tree . But still we take these other man-made offerings so much for granted that it is almost as if nature herself had supplied them , along with the air we breathe and the sea we swim in . " Private Property  --  No Trespassing " is a vicious thought to start thinking about , and I am sorry I started on it . For the very framework of those stairs , the tricky joints and so on , were not my own invention . The ideas were worked out by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what went before , but now they are borrowed and used without a thanks . Even the idea of using a saw on the boards was borrowed . I did not originate the saw , or could not have originated it . My only implements , if left to my own inventive ability alone , would probably still be limited to a stone . I would still be pounding away with it at something  --  or somebody . And yet , after all the thousands of things I have borrowedas my due from the races of man , I still have the guts to nail ( the idea of the nail too is borrowed ) upon my own stairway : " Private Property  --  No Trespassing . " It is not that I have any affection for the strangers who would tramp up and down these stairs and across my yard as the easiest way to get up and down from the sea . It is not that I have any love in my heart for them . For I have seen elsewhere along this shoreline what unsporting lunks some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them , and they answer by destroying or mutilating these things . At night they will tear down the public lookoutpavilions , and they will toss the public benches into the ocean , and they will tear up for beach fires other stairways . From time to time I have been asked to help put a stop to all of this , to complain to the police or something , or to write an article for the local paper . But how useless that would be with such people . Not merely here , but the world around . Monkeys are monkeys , and they do not read . The other day , though , while working on my stairway , I saw a lovely sight . A couple of strangers in swimming trunks were walking along the beach near the bottom of the stairway . One of them found a bottle which had just154THE FUNNY NAMEfloated in . He picked it up , smashed it upon the beach , and then continued walking on . But after a while , maybe a half-hour , the two of them returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I was working on the cliff , and the one who had thrown the bottle stepped solidly upon his own broken glass . And the beauty of the scene , as he sat there moaning and clasping his toes , was the color of the blood which flowed from his foot . Of course if such mugs resent my sign " Private Property . . . " as much as I myself resent the necessity of it , there is some satisfaction in the fact that they did not resentthe free show I must have given them while struggling month after month after month on that cliffside with pick , shovel , crowbar , ropes , sledge hammer and wedges . For the task of getting through the rocks and the bouldersand the sandstone did look hopeless for a long time , a " Miller 's Folly , " and this is when the strangers were careful not to have anything to do with me or my digging except to look . My struggles there on the cliff may have amused them but the struggles did not interest them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just enough to make the strangers wonder if I would leave any of the tools out that night . The building of the stairway , though , taught me this : my dependence on hometown friends . It merely may have been that , as week followed week , and still not much progressdone , that the friends around town were becoming bored with the stairway as being my one constant subject . For , admittedly , a personal construction can become that way , outweighing in its challenging importance everything155THE TOWN WITHelse , even one 's own living . And whenever guests came to the house I made it their duty to walk out to the edge of the cliff and look at what I was doing , or trying to do , and to have them say the sweet words : " Good God , are you really trying to do all that ? " " Yes , " I would say , and then gradually ease into some of the perplexities , thereby hinting for help . Now , hometown people are the ones we are most apt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off on some fancy flights , and when other people with " names " may seem far more important . This is when the friends at home simply let us go , let us have our fling , and ask for nothing , not even letters . But these people always are waiting at home when we return to earth again , and when we desperately may need the steadiness of their own steady personalities , or  --  as in the case of the stairway  --  their outright assistance . For instance , I have a friend in town named Bill , a retiredmining engineer . His home is up on the hill . And these stairways have now become as much his stairways as mine , although I never at anytime have helped him build a damn thing . But whenever I have needed anything , from tools to suggestions , down he comes with them from his house . And I do think , by actual count , he may have put in as many hours on those stairways as I have . But what should embarrass me is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might even go so far as to take this help for granted . There is a likelihood that we often can assume such an attitude , and simply because the people are hometown people. 156THE FUNNY NAMEAnother time , when we had to lower a heavy ship 's iron ladder down to the shore for the tidal base of the stairways , a whole gang of hometown acquaintances showed up for the heavy job , and took over . There is , then , something to all this about a hometown , perhaps any hometown , which is hard to explain , something almost holy . With one hand we can be sarcastic as can be , and then with the other hand reach for help  --  and get it . As a footnote to this , I have been sarcastic about Mrs. Billings . But she too is in on the stairway deal now , along with the others , and so the sign " Private Property  --  No Trespassing " can not apply even to her either . For on the day the iron ladder was being lowered she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so stopped her own car and came around the house , thereby making her first visit here . She was looking for Perky , I presume , but he had a chartered fishing party that day , and could not help . But when she saw what the others were doing , and even though Perky was not here , she went back out to her car , and then returned to the yard with a bottle of bourbon for everybody . " Foh evvyboddy , " she said . " Evvyboddy. " 157CHAPTER 28SOME SMALL TOWNS HAVE THEIR COLLEGE , OR MAYBE THEIR PENITENTIARY , or maybe their important factory , to carry the name of the town everywhere . But our town has none of these . We do have , though , the Institution of Oceanography . But no great pole-vaulter ever has come from there , and no school songs , immortal or otherwise , ever have been written about the place . The Institute does have a long pier reaching out into the ocean , the only pier we have . " That 's the Biological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Institute has gone under more than one name during our time , and we generally mix up the names , dependingon what is convenient or on what we are accustomed to saying through habit . In a hazy way we learn about this or that experiment being made in the Institute , or of this or that discovery having been made in the Institute . But generally we do not158THE TOWN WITH THE FUNNY NAMEknow as much about the workings of the Institute as foreignscientists may know about it or scientists from other cities . So , what the Institute needs maybe is not so many test tubes as a whangdoodle of a football team . The coach need not necessarily be the best in the world . But , still , it would be better if he were . And then when people elsewhereask us where we live , they would know , from having read the sporting pages , how the name of our town is spelled and that there really is such a town . But the way it stands now , the Institute , with its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most part by people with doctors ' degrees in science , by naturalists , and by understudies doing specialresearch there . But nobody raises hell on Saturday nights , nobody holds nightshirt parades , and no gangs from the Institute go around painting the initials " I of 0 , " or whatever they should be , upon the stonework of rival campuses , of which there seem to be none . All the Institute does , actually , is to concentrate on the ocean instead of concentrating on furthering the name of La Jolla . The Institute thinks ocean , and nothing but ocean , all day long . The people there study ocean currents , ocean winds , ocean clouds . And then some of the people there go down to the bottom of the ocean and study hidden canyons . And then some of the people invent apparatuses for the prediction of ocean storms , and to determine in advance when to expect big waves or little ones , not only for this shore but for any shore . And then some of the peo-159THE TOWN WITHple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea , whether plants , fish or animals . But never once , despite all these unsurpassed water facilities , has anybody over there suggested the organization of a rowing crew  --  one that could compete with the best , and get us and the town somewhere . We should not , of course , criticize this one-sidedness of our one and only Institute . For I for one believe in study as much as the next man , and study has its place , I admit . Yet there are times when , for the good of all of us , we should think of others besides ourselves . We should think of La Jolla . For only by working together , everybody with his shoulder to the grindstone , chins up , can we ever hope to have a better turnout next season than we had this fall . Our Institute also has its own yacht for scientific research . But no Institute band is ever on the pier to welcomethe yacht on her return , whether victorious or not victorious or a tie . All that is done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crates , the traps , the deep-water gear , and to begin studying and classifying whatever the returns might be . This is all right so far as it goes , I suppose . But what does it do towards furthering the spirit of La Jolla ? And another thing , the Institute also has an aquarium , and a splendid one . This aquarium , always in constant operation , contains local fish , local sea animals , and local sea vegetation . Anybody can go there and find out for himselfjust what life is like beyond the immediate shoreline . But no class yells are given when he enters , nobody gives16oTHE FUNNY NAMEout with the good Old Home Week . And the same goes for the Institute 's large museum . There is no complaint to be made about the hundreds of exhibits in this museum , containing as it does shells , coral and stuffed fish , including the bigger ones such as swordfish and the giant ray . Nor is any complaint to be made about how these exhibits are arranged . But the other day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case  --  I visited the museum again . I went in , looked around , and then went out . But meanwhileeverybody connected with the Institute merely continuedworking away as usual over tables or over charts . Nobody charged me anything as I entered or left , no spieler went around with me , and nobody mentioned what I had done for La Jolla back in 1923 . It is not that I minded for myself , naturally . But what if I had been some old Institute grad returning ? How would I have felt then ? And how , in contrast , would my heart have leaped with the mere greeting by everybody : " Institute of Oceanography  --  La Jolla , La JOLLA , LA JOLLA ! ! ! " 161CHAPTER 29SO MUCH POETRY AND SO MANY SONGS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT EVENINGor , as some call it , eventide , and all of them quite sentimental , that I would hesitate mentioning evening now except for the wild cottontail rabbit which lives on the oceanside of our lawn , and has lived there for a year or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a true cottontail , but I think it is , although its color and size have some of the characteristics of the smaller type bush rabbit . But whatever its true species may be , all the rumors which have been spread about the insatiability of most rabbits do not apply to this one here . Instead of seeking a fast and furious life with more rowdy companions , all this rabbit wants , apparently , is longevity . That is why he or she has stayed here so long , and always within skip-and-hop range of the low-flung grove of wild162THE TOWN WITH THE FUNNY NAMElemonade brush which is the rabbit 's sanctuary and adjoinsthe lawn . We call the rabbit " Willie , " or sometimes " Silent John , " or sometimes " Flippity Britches , " dependingas much on our own mood as the rabbit 's . Although the rabbit is in and out of the lemonade brush during other parts of the day , evening is the one sure time when the rabbit does come out , and when it behaves for the only time as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished it were a mountain lion or a gorilla or a terrible leopard . For evening also is the time around here when the birds complete their daily schedules by cleaning up in the water-filled metate , which serves as a birdbath , and by taking one more busy fling at the insects or worms in the lawn . The birds want one more snack presumably before calling it a day , and turning in for the night . The larger ocean and shore birds , though , such as the cormorants , the terns , the pelicans , the gulls , the egrets , already are flying slowly towards their own night perches , and want to get there before dark . But the smaller birds , which will perch for the night right around here , do not care so much about the time element . Instead , they seem to want to make doubly sure , is all , that they and their young will not wake up around midnight too hungry to sleep any more . This is when , then , the oceanside patch of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of condensed pageantof phoebe flycatchers , the more selfish mockingbirds , a few hummingbirds , once in a while an oriole or two , and some other kinds of birds which I can not name . For I am not up on names of birds and am not a naturalist , and163THE TOWN WITHalmost anything which resembles a California robin is a California robin to me , and I let it go at that . Oh , sure , I do know a killdeer , of course , and simply because a killdeer , being a fiend for publicity , keeps pronouncing its name . And so killdeers , with their black choke collars , and their crazy way of having hiccups , come onto the lawn too , and make as much a selfish spectacle of themselves as do the mockingbirds . But everything is out for something . The bigger birds chase away the smaller birds from the metate , and the smaller birds chase away the still smaller birds , or make them wait another turn at the water . And yet evening , when the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a time of peace and quietness and reflection . It is not that way at all , especially when these birds get together . Nor is it that way with the rabbit , either . This is the one time of day , as I mentioned , when the rabbit , so accustomed to being scared by anything which has a mouth , now wants desperately to hop out of character , if merely once in its life , and scare the holy hell out of something , anything at all . After all these years of looking at each other , the rabbit knows me by now . Or at least I assume it knows me by now , for I am about the only one who can walk out onto the lawn without the rabbit leaping instantly into the lemonade brush . I can only walk out just so far , however , and no farther , before the rabbit disappears . For to the rabbit I am still that flesh-eating ogre who periodically appears from his cave , which is my doorway and my home. 164THE FUNNY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some people have been known to tame other wild animals , for I would not know how to go about it . All I have done is to let the rabbit live its life , and I have lived mine . Whenever I want to go out onto the lawn I go out there , and it is up to the rabbit to scram if it wants to . Yet there are people , I suppose , who are gifted in training wild beasts who would do something about the situation . They would get down on their hands and knees maybe , or wiggle their fingers , and say : " Come here , ' ittle wabbit , come here . I wo n't hurt ' ittle wabbit . " But if they will not hurt the rabbit , somebody else somewhereelse surely would , as soon as the rabbit got to thinking : " Mercy me , mercy me , people are n't so bad , after all . So I think I 'll take a gander around the rest of the neighborhood . " I can not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an understanding about all this , insomuch as I can not speak for the rabbit . But I do know that as long as I have made no overtures towards the rabbit , such as putting out special food or anything like that , the rabbit is more than satisfied to stay right here and nowhere else . For it certainly is free enough to go meandering around elsewhere  --  and get beaned in the head  --  whenever it likes . But the other evening , with the birds around as usual , I went outdoors , and the rabbit did a strange thing . It stood its ground , and continued nibbling grass , almost as if I had not come outdoors . The rabbit 's ears , however , continued working , they continued swinging this way and that , two radars in motion , even as the rabbit nibbled . It165THE TOWN WITH THE FUNNY NAMEwas on the alert , all right , but apparently did not want me to think it was on the alert , and then I went back into the house , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the thought occurred to me that the rabbit , having realized its own success , now leaped to the other extreme and was saying : " It 's sure lucky for you , you big mug , that you did n't come one step closer . I 'd have mopped you , I 'd have mopped you  --  " What convinced me of this is that , after I had returned inside the house , one of the killdeers landed quite close to the rabbit and began working on either a worm or an insectthere . Heretofore neither the birds nor the rabbit had paid the least bit of attention to each other ; the rabbit could have been but another bird so far as the birds ever were concerned . But this time the rabbit , after having noticed my own retreat , now boldly and all at once took two little hops directly and deliberately towards the killdeer , and might even have tried to take another one , except that the killdeerjust then did one of its crazy hiccups . Wherewith the rabbit , suddenly overwhelmed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lemonadebrush , and the bird merely continued its eating . But the overall performance was enough to convince me that even rabbits , on certain evenings , can all at once become god-damn sick of being rabbits. 166CHAPTER 30NOT FAR FROM HERE , ON THE TOP OF MOUNT PALOMAR IN OUR BACKCOUNTRY , is the most far-reaching observatory in the world  --  capable of reaching a billion light years away  --  and it is time I did something about all this . For the observatory has been under planning and constructionsome twenty years , or long enough anyway for me to have written some of the first local newspaper stories about the earlier construction , and some of the statistics about the observatory I can recite almost automatically , so often have I recorded them in my time and so often have I read them . Not only that , but I have been saving and collecting some of the statistics too , and the other day I found them and dumped them here upon a little table in my workroom  --  thinking to have them handy for whatever I should want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not much of a table , and actually167THE TOWN WITHdoes not belong in the room . Yet there was nowhere else in the house to put the thing , and so the workroom inheritedit , and now the table seems to want to stay , and appears to be striving to repay its indebtedness by accumulatingstuff which is not wanted or needed or of any use . The table could be one bum looking out for a lot of others . And especially can this be true on those certain morningswhen everything around us suddenly appears so puzzling , so challenging , so unrecorded as to their limit  --  like the billion light years of the observatory  --  that all I can do for a long time about the challenge is to remain sitting in the workroom with my feet propped upon the little table and being a bum too . For there I sit wishing I were something like a godawmighty capable for once of looking from the outside in , and not from the inside out , as just another of the puzzles also . So I sit there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wondering why I do not clean it off by chucking everything on it over the cliff  --  and saving only these resurrected clippings about the observatory with its world-beating Zoo-inch mirror ( although we used to refer to it as " lens " ) . And then I get to wondering how each single item of trash there on the table has an ancestry as ancient perhaps as anything which can be recorded through the great mirror . For we are all a part of the same universe , so far as we yet know , and we all grew up together , each molecule of us , the trash as well as ourselves , and the molecules or atoms in the mirror itself . And I get to wondering , too , how the ancestry of this trash on the table may be older even than our own earth , 168THE FUNNY NAMEand how parts or portions of the workmanship in each item encompasses just about every science or experiment in the stages of man or evolution or mathematics or art , or all of these put together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go . On this table I see an abalone shell , faded and at one time used for an ashtray ; I see a crumbled cigarette packagewith its tinfoil and containing one forgotten cigarette ; I see a broken piece of walrus ivory brought down from the Bering and with a crude carving by some Eskimo ; I see somebody 's forgotten linen handkerchief ; a burned-out lightglobe ; a cracked pipe which still may be usable in emergencies ( I 'll have to see about that ) ; a wooden stirrup from somewhere in South America ; a used-up notebook with its back partly torn off ; the wooden carving of a nude female done on some island in the South Pacific , and the carving is exceptionally nude and exceptionally female ; a flashlight without batteries ; a broken pencil ; a telegram of several years ago and the contents of which I now would have no idea of without looking ; match-folders with only one or at most a few forgotten matches in them ; a leather comb case without a comb ; three dice ( but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a curled-up tube of glue which no longer works ; a tiny toy mouth organ . . . . Yet if only I were able to trace the true lineage of these items , or even a few of these items , back through their full source , their geography , their materials ( vegetable , animalor mineral ) , the races which , bit by bit , contributed to each of them , and the millions of years the materials themselveswere forming , or how their seeds of life , or of be-169THE TOWN WITHing , came in the first place to be lodged upon this particularplanet  --  then indeed I would be producing an odd and perhaps total history of our earth . We refer to the observatory as " the giant eye of Palomar , " our pet phrase for the creation . And I know a lot of other phrases as well , how " the mirror is able to make the moon seem only twenty-five miles away , " and " how untold new secrets of space are sure to be found , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making , weighs fourteen-and-a-half tons . " But still I do nothing about these phrases , of course , except to continue staring over my propped-up feet at the clippings , some of them my own old ones , and also I continuestaring at the accumulated trash around them . For I can not even catch up with the full story of the trash , or even one item of the trash . And I can find only one satisfaction , but only one , and that is that the largest book we have , the Encyclopedia , has failed to exhaust any of this material either . The Encyclopedia also has to stop somewhere . Or I may glance from the cluttered table out the window , and the motion of glancing is in itself but another mystery multiplied by mysteries . But again , everything the glance takes in , the full source and purpose of everythingthe glance takes in , becomes a mystery also , even the leaf on a tree , or the tree itself , or the baby mockingbird on the tree , or the feathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a mystery surrounded by mysteriesthat  --  regardless of " the giant eye of Palomar "  --  it170THE FUNNY NAMEalmost seems as if we are designed not to have a full conception of anything , and when insanity , after all , might seem the only condition which is normal . For , if insane enough , what is to prevent me from assumingthat this little table with all its miscellaneous stuff is not merely a little table , but a stage , a stage so thorough that it encompasses time ( a billion light years ) as well as characters within characters within characters  --  and all of them having endured in some form , and for so long , that the " giant eye of Palomar " is just now reaching the beginning of their act . Or maybe it is their second or third act . I do not know . But , anyway , the burned-out lightglobe becomes a balletof characters , the tiny mouth organ becomes a ballet of characters , the tinfoil on the cigarette package becomes a ballet of characters , and within each of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all of them singing and dancing and whirling their own amazingparts . That there is motion in them , we know , and that there is sound in them , we know . And their act may as well be called The Dance Of The Trillion Little Solar Systems or The Giant Eye Of Palomar In Reverse . But I see no movement . That is the trouble . The movementis there , the heritage is there , the conflict is there , the rhythm is there , the ageless stories within stories  --  of how they happened to be now as they are  --  all this is there . But if there is to be movement which I can see or record ( and it is time I did at least something ) I must produce171THE TOWN WITH THE FUNNY NAMEthis visible motion myself on the stage . So I do so by movingmy feet from off the stage , from off the little table , from off the other assortment of trash up there . Yet the full source history of these feet , and why my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all this is just as lengthy , just as baffling , as anything off of which I have taken them . And so I wonder if even this town , or any town , no matterhow small , when traced through the ancient source of its various people , where they came from and why , and all the rest of it , could be like these things on the little table , could be like another unwritten history of the entire earth  --  and of things beyond the earth , things we will be told about up on the mountain. 172CHAPTER 31LIFE , I SUPPOSE , IS A CASE OF GETTING USED TO CHANGES , and age , I suppose , is a definite realization of being unable to do anything about them . For , in regard to everybody coming here to town , and all at once , if a symphony were to be composed about this section right now , the predominating chord would have to be , as in the Anvil Chorus , the sound of pounding , pounding , pounding . Yet there should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live which does not change every day , and where in the morning we can look out and see at least something which is still familiar . But even since I started this book , changes have taken place which make me almost wonder if I am here or somewhere else . The ocean , or the colors of the ocean , are about all that remain the same . But even the colors upon the ocean can173THE TOWN WITHbe different from what they used to be . For more people are out upon the ocean now , and whereas I used to be able to recognize just about every local boat , and who owned it , I can not do this any longer , and partly because of the warsurplussales in yellow rubberboats . They put a different hue to the ocean , especially on week-ends , giving it almost a smallpox effect . And not only that , but the packages of green dye in the pockets of these rubberboats have not always been removed ahead of time , or before the warsurplussale was made , so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who apparently enjoy watching the brilliant green spread and spread . Although this dye originally was for the purpose of helpinglost flyers become located , once they had inflated their rubberboats and were drifting around , the purpose of this dye now seems to be to prove that the ocean also is something which can be changed the same as anything else until even the local fish perhaps are now as bewilderedas the rest of us . The other day , though , I watched a group of newcomingartists put up their easels along a shore-cliff and try to capture the startling green of one of these widening patches . The artists of course did not know what had caused the green , but their eagerness was such that I am sure they must have been saying among themselves how nowhere else except in California could an ocean have such unexpected shades . Often I wonder , however , why people or businesses or organizations which keep on boosting for more and more changes , or for larger and larger populations , do not174THE FUNNY NAMEthemselves go to places which already are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the rest of us alone . Or the way I feel about it now , if I were to be asked ( which I will not be ) by the local Chamber of Commerce to prepare national advertisements about this section , my advertising copy would contain such phrases as pestilenceridden , scourged by locusts , hailstorms with hailstones the size of watermelons , malaria , swamps with water moccasins and cottonmouths , poisonous man-eating plants , and typhoontidal waves resulting in chickens in the bedroom every Friday . But maybe even heaven too has its jolly-up committees  --  people who , for the sake of attracting crowds , put on weeks of rodeos and fiestas , and then penalize or fine everyone during these weeks who does not grow a beard . For the momentum of earth-life , and the love of crowds , may be something with these people which can not be dropped all at once , or the moment their car goes over its last embankment . I forget , though , that I have been on earth almost a half-century , and so by now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . And I forget , too , that the rest of us also are changes , and help produce changes , so long as we move anywhere about the earth . Nothing is quite the same , or as it was in the beginning , after we ourselves came . But we need not necessarily gloat about it . Or if ever I am tempted to presume that crowded towns and crowded buildings are something new in this world , and that only of late have people wanted to spend their days squirming against each other , I have but to remember175THE TOWN WITHseeing one of the oldest of towns  --  the ruins of Pompeii  --  and of being impressed by the fact that not a vacant lot or a vacant footage seemed to have been in the whole community . A single wall could have served for two buildings , and the streets , which I imagined having been filled at one time with bungling chariots , were so narrow and the corners so sharp that the whole thing literally must have been hell-on-wheels for the traffic cop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that the entire world suddenly has decided to descend upon us , and to go nowhere else , maybe some of the puzzled little guys in Pompeii had the same notion long ago , and were saying : " Ye gods of Vesuvius damn it , but I like things as they used to be around here . " For the phrase of " wanting things as they used to be " must be , in this kingdom of man , a dramatically old one , and must in its time have been spoken in many languages , some of them now extinct . There is a certain sadness though , especially out here on the ever-changing West Coast , that as mortals we are not entitled ever to see again any place as it used to be . Maybe the Ozarks still have such places , or maybe the hills of Tennessee still have such places , but out here we do not . Yet the people coming here must be coming from somewhere . Ghost towns or ghost villages must be in the process of being ghosted somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , local papers have a new story to tell us about some of our incoming neighbors , and from this morning 's paper I will quote one , as recorded by the176THE FUNNY NAMEUnited Press , as just another example of our good fellowshipwith other places : ( Woman 's name  --  ) , 33 , today said the father of her 13 children , who eloped with their 16-year-old baby sitter , was a perfect husband who " always shared and shared alike with me and the kids when the relief checks came . " The husband , ( his name ) , 37 , an occasional carpenterwho has been on relief here and in Arizona for six years , and the baby sitter , chubby ( her name ) , were held in Phoenix pending arrival of California sheriff 's deputies to bring them home . The Sheriff 's office said it would send officers after the elopers as soon as possible .

Records showed the parents and the 10 children still living with them came here in April , 1942 , from Arizona , where they were on relief for two years . They were on Phoenix relief rolls four years before that , after arriving from Oklahoma . The wife could not understand her husband'selopement . " He 's always been a perfect husband and father , " she said . " Never worked too much , but he always shared and shared alike with me and the kids when177THE TOWN WITHthe relief checks came in . But I could n't take him back after this . He could n't be trusted any more .

I told my husband that I did n't think she should be stringing along with him . She just teased , tortured and tantalized him . " ( Flash Insert : ) In this afternoon 's paper , I have just learned , however , that the wife and husband again are reconciled , all is forgiven , and so we have a happy ending , after all  --  and so perhaps , too , another lovely baby already is on its way . But even though the hills and valleys and villages of Oklahoma and Arkansas and Tennessee must surely be getting vacated to supply us with so many eager-breeding newcomers , nevertheless it would seem that the adults from there would wish to return at some time to the scenes of their childhood when fond recollections return them to view . But the adults do not seem to want to do that . And even though the scenes of their childhood could possibly178THE FUNNY NAMEhave changed as much back there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years ago , and in hope of finding an old memory place still intact ( all of us are entitled to at least one of these ) I revisited the Northwest where as a kid I had been sent to school . Not having the money to go just traveling around , or to go searching for emotions , this trip was tied up with some assignment on my way to Alaska , and I remembered how , out of Everett , Washington , there had been a wild little river which had its source deep in the Cascade Mountains . And I remembered how , during a school vacation , two other youngsters and I had followed this wild little river up from Granite Falls , and up into the mountains . Two weeks , maybe three weeks , we had all of this to ourselves , and with the snow-pocketed mountains as the finality and the kicker . There were deer , there were bear tracks , and there were berries . There were great boulders , big pools and great trees . And all of these belonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tramped , climbed and waded , and as we slept on ferns at night . And so strong was my memory of these weeks of wild perfection along the little tumbling river that I could not resist , these many years later , of returning to " our " river . I should have known better , of course . For not only was the river now lined with habitations , drive-ins , motor-courts , but the little river itself was conspicuously posted with this sign : " Warning : Do Not Drink This Water . " Many stories are written , as we know , about , " Old New York , " or " That Was New York , " or " New York As **25;3701;TOOLONG leaned farther over the table and peered at Gwen through the shadow . " And just how did you get here , young woman ? " he asked . " Curt , " he said , turning his head ponderously to look at Harold , " who is this young woman , and how did she come here ? " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of days . " " Gwen ? Gwen ? And who on earth , may I ask , is Gwen ? " Hespoke as if Harold were an audience of many people .  --  " Gwendolyn Williams , Dad . You remember her . " " I do not remember her , " the old man said . He swung his head back and stared at her again . " Gwendolyn Williams , " he muttered . Gwen had a filled plate in each hand , but she waited there by the stove while he stared at her . " Oh , " the father said finally . " Of course . Harold 's intended . Old Lew Williams ' girl . Charming girl too , charming , " he added . " Curt , " he said , turning his head slowly to look at Harold again , and grinning a little , " Curt , I 'm surprised at you , letting a young whippersnapper like . . . " He stopped speaking and stared at Harold , and his grin faded . " No , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time with them closed , breathing loudly and frowning . Gwen came to the table then , and set the plates down , one in front of each of the men . The father opened his eyes again . " Where 's Curt ? " " He 'll be back today , Dad . " " Back today ? I should hope so . " He thought about the matter , and then rolled his eyes to look at Harold without moving his head . He made a sly , knowing grin , and slowly , triumphantly , raised one hand and pointed at him . " Out hunting , " he announced . " That 's where he is . And he 'll get it too . He do n't ever give up till he gets what he 's after , Curt do n't . He 's a great shot , too , Curt is , " he went on happily , " a great shot . Why , I remember once , " he began , addressing his greater audience again , " and when he was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around there , he won a turkey shoot down at old Jake Haley 's ranch on the Carson River . Jake called the place a ranch , anyway . Half a dozen dryP151washes full of sagebrush , three scrawny cottonwood trees , and a litter of rags and old shoes and broken-down wagons is about what it amounted to . Jake used to say himself , when he had enough rot-gut in him to be half-way human , that rags was his chief crop . Grew old shirts about three to the bush , he did , though pants was rarer . But he did have turkeys . An old scoundrel , Jake Haley was , " he said , chuckling . " He cleaned up on those birds , though there was n't a thing to ' em but legs and feathers . They were more like buzzards than turkeys . In his more sociable moods he used to admit they were a cross , and that with the natural advantages of his place , the buzzard strain was getting a little the best of it . He could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So he used ' em all for turkey shoots . Four bits for three shots ; plain highway robbery . And there could n't anybody hit ' em , even at that price , the way he had it rigged . Buried ' em in a barrel in the ground , with only the head sticking out . Hundred yards , if it was an inch , and uphill , and enough neck room so the turkey could dodge all around . Made a mint out of that system , old Jake did . But he got one good scare , anyway , and Curt gave it to him . Knocked one off on the second shot . " He laughed a thin , gleeful whinny , startling after his deep voice speaking . " Should have seen old Jake 's face . Only the third man to shoot , and he got one . Nothing in the rules to say he could n't keep on shooting all day , either . Old Jake thought he was ruined . " He cackled happily . Gwen pushed aside the bottles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it very slowly , to avoid catching his attention , but he saw the bottles moving and looked up at her . The pleasuredied out of his face . " Young woman , " he said heavily , " I beg your pardon . Inexcusableof me . Inexcusable . " " It 's all right , Mr. Bridges , " Gwen said , flushing . " It 's all right , " the father repeated . " You hear that , Curt ? " he asked Harold . " Your intended , and I forget her name . Inexcusable . But she says it 's all right . You 're a lucky boy , Curt , very lucky . " Gwen sat down quickly in the mother 's place , and she and  |p152Harold  began to eat . They could n't look at the father or at each other . After a time the old man turned his head slowly and stared at Harold . " No , Harold 's girl , " he said . " Curt 's out hunting , the young fool . But he 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He do n't ever give up till he gets what he 's after , Curt do n't . Why I remember once , " he began , changing to his public voice , but then thought about it , and stopped there . He began to eat , taking huge mouthfuls , but chewing them slowly . Once he put his fork down and sat staring at the shadow of the lamp while he chewed . " It killed Arthur , just the same , " he argued . Harold looked at him quickly . " What did ? " " That damned black painter . Only I thought it was Curt . He was wearing Curt 's coat . Was n't , though ; was Arthur . Saw his beard . Arthur took Curt 's coat . " He considered that , sitting perfectly still . " Why 'd he take Curt 's coat ? " he demanded . He stared at Harold angrily . " Keepingthings from me , " he accused . " Everybody keeps things from me . In my own house . " Harold sighed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , they are . Ca n't even have an opinion around here any more . Ca n't fool me , though , " he said craftily . " I know what 's going on . Saw him on the bed in there . I know . Black painter killed him . " " Maybe a painter , Dad , but not likely black . " The old man stared at him angrily , but then gradually the anger weakened into confusion , and after a minute he turned back to his plate . When he had finished his food , Gwen brought him a second cup of coffee . He sat there trying to drink it , but kept nodding and sagging forward . " There 's nothing you can do now , Dad , " Harold said . " Why do n't you go up and lie down for a while ? " " Nothing anybody can do in this infernal snow , " the old man muttered . " Might as well all go to bed . " He hoisted himself to his feet and stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair . " Waited up all night , " he said . " Very tired . You will excuse me , my dear , " he said to Gwen . " Have to step outside for a moment , " he said to Harold.  |p153He  swung around slowly , keeping his hands on the chair , and looked out the window again . Then he swung back , and leaned over . Carefully extending one hand , he poured his glass half full of whisky again , and lifted it . " Drop to warm myself first , " he explained . " Cold out . Too early for winter . Always feel the cold more when winter 's too early . " He drank the whisky off without stopping , set the glass down , and straightened up . When he had his balance behind the chair , he turned and lurched toward the outside door . Harold got up quickly and went to help him , but the old man waved him away angrily . " All right , " he muttered . " Quite all right . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door open and lurched out , nearly falling as he stepped down into the snow . He saved himself by his hold on the handle of the door , and the door closed suddenly and loudly . Harold picked up the two whisky bottles , threw the empty one into the trash box under the sink , and put the other into the cabinet . Gwen began to clear the table , and he helped her , but they still did n't talk . When the old man returned , he balanced in the doorway and peered at the table . " Where 'd you put it ? " he asked . He left the door open , and steered carefully across to the table . The cold air and the fresh smells of snow and pine came in behind him . He leaned on the table and looked around over its top . " Where 'd you put it ? " he asked again . Then he grinned knowingly . " Is no use , " he said . " Think you can hide things from me , eh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Harold said . " It 's in the sideboard . You 'd better get some sleep now , though . You look tired . " The old man was touched by this sympathy . The tears welled up over his red lids , and began to trickle down his cheeks . " Tired , " he said . " Waited up all night for him . Better get some sleep . " He worked his way to the foot of the stairs , and there , holding onto the rail , drew himself up and turned to face them . " Beg your pardon , young woman , " he said to Gwen . " Inexcusable . ' Solutely inexcusable . " He said inexcusable very slowlyp154and carefully , and did n't miss a syllable . Then he turned back and began to pull himself up the stairs , using both hands on the rail and pausing on each step . Harold came over to the foot of the stairs , and he and Gwen stood watching every move the old man made . His heavy breathingand the creak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A step or two above the middle of the stairs , he stumbled and swung back on one heel . Gwen uttered a little , nervous cry and put her hands up to her cheeks quickly . Harold sprang up the stairs . The old man caught himself with the rail behind him , and hung there , his chin down hard against his chest , and his eyes closed . Harold got up to him , and steadied him above the rail . After a minute , he drew the old man 's arm over his own shoulder , and , still holding him around the waist too , started him up again . They went very slowly , the father sagging and letting his head roll , but pulling with one hand on the rail . They reached the landing , and paused while Harold got a new hold to take the whole weight , and then shuffled in through the bedroom door . Gwen sighed , and let her hands down again slowly . She stood there a moment more , listening , and then turned back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not touching the waiting dishes . She heard their voices speak briefly above , and then the old man made a long , relaxing groan . Harold said something more , and his boots sounded loudly , coming out onto the landing . The door was closed , and the boots came down the hollow stairs . " Fell asleep the minute he hit the bed , " Harold said . He did n't say anything more about it , though . He carried in wood from the pile against the house and filled the wood-box and built up the fire . Then he brought the mother 's cup and plate from the bedroom , saying softly , " She only drank the coffee again , " and blew out the lamp over the table . Gwen had Joe Sam 's cup and plate ready then . She gave them to Harold and went ahead of him to open the door . " Make him eat something this time , Hal , " she said . Harold nodded . " And you get some rest , " he ordered gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while now . You let the dishes wait , and get some sleep . " Gwen took hold of his coat with both hands and raised herp155face toward his . They stood in the doorway , with the idle flakes turning against them and their mouths together . Finally Gwen gave him a quick little extra kiss and let go of him . She stood in the doorway until he had gone around the corner of the house . Harold let himself into the bunk-house , saying , " Here 's some breakfast for you , Joe Sam , " and knew before he was done speakingthat the old man was n't there . The fire was almost out and the whisky smell and the staleness of sleep-breathing were heavy in the cooling air . Joe Sam 's bunk was empty , but his clothes were still lying across the foot of it and his moccasins still stood together under the edge of the stove . Holy cat , Harold thought , he 's gone out with nothing on . I should have seen his tracks when I came up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear and bewilderment that had ciiade him sweat in the clearing in his dream . " He made tracks , all right , " he told himself aloud . " You just did n't have your eyes open . " He set the plate and cup down on the box by the stove , crossed quickly to the trash keg , and tilted it so the light from the window showed the inside of it . The bottle neck was n't there . He let the keg back and went to the door and looked down the hill toward the house . The fear took hold of him again . There were only the two lines of his own tracks , one already softened by new snow , the other still sharp-edged and clear . For a moment he wanted to run back down to the house and see with his own eyes that Gwen was all right . He wanted to touch her and hear her speak . He was briefly possessed by a superstitious notion that everybody on the place was changing toward something strange and evil , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one could see what was happening except when some little hint of the unnatural got out , like this . But then he saw the tracks , and they were real enough , onlyp156already blurred by the new snow too . They went close along the side of the bunk-house , and then straight up into the edge of timber , where he lost sight of them in the brush . Reading the tracks as far as he could see them , he could imagine the old Indian making them , advancing slowly and watchfully , and stopping often to look around , like a timid , dangerous animal stalking something or escaping . He 'd be holding that bottle neck ready all the time too , like a knife . " This is the craziest yet , " he said aloud . " Have to lock the old bastard up next , " and again wanted to run down to the house and be sure everything was all right before he did anything else . " You just came from there , " he told himself . " Let 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut and started up the slope beside the line of prints left by the small , square feet . Where they turned into the thickets , he stopped and looked warily ahead , stooping a little to take cover in the bushes . Except for once in a while a startling fall of snow from an overburdened bough , there was only the white and shadowy quiet under the pines . There were hiding places everywhere , though : the walls of snow-drifted brush and granite boulders as tall as a man , and all the dark tree trunks . He 'd have to keep his eyes open , be sure of the tracks far enough ahead so they could n't circle back on him without his knowing it . He could feel between his shoulders the thought of the little , dark man with the bottle neck in his fist and the secret joke in his good eye , creeping out of some cover behind him . The tracks went south across the hillside above the house . They never came down out of the woods , but zig-zagged from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and deepenedin each hiding place , as if Joe Sam had stood or squatted there for a long time . Where the pines had kept the tracks free of the morning snow , Harold stopped too , to stare down . It made him uneasy to see the print of a naked human foot in snow . It was n't right there . The split-heart print of a deer , the dots and dashes of rabbits , the fine tail line and tiny forget-menotsof wood mice , or even the big , broken flower of a panther or a bobcat , those were all as right in snow as black letters onp157paper . But this complicated , unique print , not even a little like/ any of them , was all wrong . There was too much time forgotten between . He shook himself out of the wondering , and moved faster along the trail , sometimes taking short-cuts where he could see both legs of a side trip . South of the house the tracks curved out toward the valley along the low , descending ridge that made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down out of the pines and into the manzanita and then the high , feathery sage where the quail lived . The quail startled him once , breaking up out of cover with a soft , multiple thunder of wings . He caught his breath and stopped where he was . The quail all fled upslope from him , but fanning out toward the valley and the mountain . Toward the top of the ridge , they began to drop out of sight again in the brush by ones and twos , and one bunch of a dozen or so together . The silence came back , and he was ashamed , and a little worried , because he had let them startle him . He should have seen them first , and he certainly should have noticed the spidery writing of their tracks everywhere in the lanes through the brush . But he had n't ; he 'd seen only the heavy , human track he was following through them . After that he was ashamed of his worry . It 's still only Joe Sam , he told himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and full of whisky and dreams . He was still worried about that bottle neck , though , and because he could n't guess what Joe Sam was up to . He tried to remember something that would tell him for sure whether Joe Sam had broken that bottle on purpose or by accident . All he could find was his own dream-groggy first impression that it had n't been an accident , and he did n't trust that now . He thought he discovered something else , though . That was what made the shot , he thought . It was too close for Curt to make it . Ile was still clear up at the top of that avenue through the trees . That 's how I got into the bedroom and saw the hole come in Arthur 's face . That was when Joe Sam broke the bottle . What difference does it make ? he thought . I did n't see him break it . He took it back out of the keg , though , and maybe that does . He wants it for something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought suddenly . He put it down sop158carefully when I told him to drop it . Well , what of it ? When he gets to thinking black painter'He stopped short again , telling himself sharply , Wake up , will you ? The trail had entered an open space in the brush with tracks all over it , and flecks of blood and the slaty blue feathers and tawny down of a quail . It was a mess that would show from yards off , and he 'd walked right into it before he saw it . A coyote or a bobcat got one , he thought , and Joe Sam stopped to look at the marks , like I am . But then he saw that there were n't any tracks but the quail writing and Joe Sam 's , except one wandering line left by a hopping rabbit . He looked around until he saw where Joe Sam 's tracks went on out of the open space . There were no blood marks going with it . He hunted around then until he saw the dead quail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and to the right , and there was no track going up to it , not the bird 's or any other . He climbed to the place and picked up the quail . It was a valley quail , with the black top-knot curving forward like a plume on an old lady 's bonnet . Its round , gray body was already cold , and it did n't weigh enough on his hand . The head , with the halfclosedeye , hung away limp over his finger tips , and he could feel that the neck was nearly cut through . He turned the quail over on his hand . On the other side the feathers and down were torn away from half the breast and shoulder , and the wound showed . It was circular , with several deep punctures around the edge . Flesh had been torn out of the center of the wound till the bones showed , but there was no wet blood in it . Not much blood , he thought . Not much dry blood , even , and then thought , quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and looked carefully all around , but saw only the motionlessbrush , with the light , separate flakes of snow falling silently upon it . Sucked the blood , he thought , looking down at the hole again . Ate some of the meat raw , and then sucked the blood . He dropped the bird back beside its bush , giving it a small , pitying thought , but no more , and went down , and out of the trampled clearing along Joe Sam 's trail again . He went much faster now , and kept a watch around him all the time . The tracks curved down along the north slope of the ridge , and then , where the brush thinned out and grew smaller , and the grassp159began , they changed . There were hand prints , and only narrow takings of the toes , and deep pits , always two together and a little staggered . On his hands and knees , Harold thought , watching the house . And he still has that damned bottle neck , he thought , seeing the print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball of the right fist . From there only the footprints showed ahead , though , dwindlingin a straight line toward the house . And running , too , Harold thought , seeing them farther apart and the snow between them only lightly marked and sometimes not at all . Ile broke into a run himself , peering ahead at the house all the time , now that the trail did n't need watching . There was nothingmoving in sight , except the cluster of steers that had come in off the snowy range and were waiting by the fenced haystacks , and more of them coming , far off in the north . At the corner of the house he had to stop again , because the trail divided . There were crawling tracks again , along the base of the south wall . They ended under the bunk-room window , and then came back , making a confused double trail . It thinned out into a single , clear trail along the back of the house . Looked in at the window , Harold thought . Watching Grace ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen window , and then under the west window of the bedroom , beside the bed where Arthur was lying . Looking in every place , Harold thought . He did n't try to get in , though . What 's he want to watch them for ? Half running , he followed the tracks around the corner and along the north side . At the northeast corner he stopped and breathed easier , and even grinned a little . The tracks did n't go to the door at all . They went out straight across the yard to the sheds and into the tunnel between them . " What the hell is he up to now ? " he asked himself softly . He went across the yard and into the tunnel , just walking now . From the tunnel , he could see Joe Sam standing inside the corral fence with his back turned . He was naked , all right , and one of his braids had come unraveled at the end and hung in a loose brush behind his shoulder . He had the bottle neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing anything with it , just holdingp160it as if he 'd forgotten it . Harold came to the gate , where he could see the whole corral . There were mounds of hay newly thrown out along the wall of the shed , and all the horses were lined up there eating . The tiny feathers of snow clung on the tips of their velvety coats like frost , and their breathing male small clouds in the cold air . Joe Sam was just standing there watching the horses eat , for all anybody could see . Harold spoke his name . Joe Sam did n't move , and Harold spoke again , more loudly . The horses all raised their heads together and looked at him , the hay working like big , false moustaches at the corners of their mouths . Curt 's black stallion , Kentuck , was right in front of Joe Sam . He raised his head with the others and looked at Harold , but then , while the others kept watching him , their large , blue-glazed eyes only faintly curious , Kentuck looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the hay , taking a new mouthful , but at once raised his head again , rolling the hay between his jaws , and looked at the old Indian . Watching each other , Harold thought . Now what ? and stooped and crawled between the bars . He stopped just out of reach of Joe Sam and spoke his name again . This time Joe Sam turned part way toward him , and turned his head farther to look at him . He moved slowly and calmly . " Give hay , " he said . " Horse eat . " He was all ready with that , Harold thought . He knew I was here all along . " You 'll freeze , standing around with nothing on , " he said . " Here , give me that thing before you cut yourself . " He held his hand out , but watched the old face steadily . The life went out of it now . It aged greatly while he looked at it , and became sad and confused . After a moment Joe Sam lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break , " he said dully . He held it out to Harold . When he had let go of it , his jaw began to shake , and then the shaking spread until he was jerkingall over . He hunched his shoulders against the jerking , and crossed his hands in front of his crotch . " Cold , " he said . Harold tossed the bottle neck out of the coral on the far side ,  |p161toward  the haystacks . " Come on in the tack room , " he said , " and we 'll find something for you to put on . " " Cold , " the old Indian said again . " Whisky good . " " No more whisky , " Harold said , wondering if it was a joke this time too . He took Joe Sam by the arm , and led him in through the open door of the hay shed . " Your breakfast 's up at the bunk-house . You get up there and get dressed and put some wood in the fire and eat your breakfast . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from a bad dream , he thought . He does n't even know what he 's been doing . Or is he still playing possum ? He found an old linen dust coat of the father 's in the tack room , one he 'd used to make a show in , years before , in San Francisco . It was stained in big patches now , and most of the buttons were gone . He took it off the nail , and held it for Joe Sam to get into . The old man would n't move , though , and he had to put it on him as if he were dressing a young child who was thinking about something else . Then he opened the door into the yard and said , " Now go on up there before you freeze to death . I 'll be up as quick as finish the chores . " " Help , " Joe Sam said . " No . You go on up and get dressed and eat your breakfast . " " Eat soon , " Joe Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold you ? Harold thought , and after a moment shrugged his shoulders and said , " All right , then . You feed the chickens . Better get something on your feet , though . I sere , take these . " From the corner under the work harnesses , lie pulled out an old pair of boots with rubber feet and felt tops that were used for mucking out the corrals and the pig pen . Solemnly and slowly , hindered by spasms of jerking , Joe Sam put them on . Then he stood there , small and half asleep , lost in the huge ( luster , and with the boots like a solid base under him , nod anything his feet could move . Harold smiled a little in his mind , remembering , already as if it had happened a long time hack , how he had made a mystery to be afraid of out of this tired , little , old man , who was just holding death off with whiskyp162and legends . He rolled up the sleeves of the dust coat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right . You feed the chickens . " Joe Sam went out slowly , dragging the big boots . Harold stood in the door and watched until he disappeared around the end of the south shed , toward the chicken run . Then he closed the door and went out to start the other chores himself . He finished by tossing out hay from the stacks for the cattle that were waiting in the trampled snow outside the fences . Then he went back up toward the sheds in the lane between the stacks and the corral , and remembered that he 'd thrown the bottle neck out there somewhere . Might as well get it out of his reach for good , he thought , but as soon as he started to look for it , saw the trenches the big boots had made in the snow . He looked for the bottle neck out where the tracks ended . He found the mark of it , but the bottle neck was gone . Still at it , he thought patiently , but then his patience broke . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought furiously , and imaginedwith pleasure how his hands would make the old man pay attention this time . He went on up toward the sheds , walking with stiff , quick strides . When he came to the stake fence of the chicken run , he saw Joe Sam already inside , standing out in the middle , with the wooden , half-peck measure in the circle of his left arm . He was slowly scattering the grain for the chickens , making a kind of ceremony of it , as he always did . Harold could not hold his anger against the peaceful sight . Do n't you get like Curt , he told himself , and remembered how Curt had bullied the old man , pushing the stallion at him until he was forced to retreat , and then many other times back Lof that . He stood holding two stakes of the fence in his fists , and watched Joe Sam . He thought of Arthur watching Joe Sam feed the chickens . It was like watching a kind of play , Arthur said , a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . It made you hunt for what it meant . If Arthur was working anywhere near , he 'd always stop and come to the fence to watch Joe Sam feed the chickens , and he 'd always go away afterwards slowly , and smiling to himself . It made Arthur alive again top163think of him standing at the stake fence watching . It was at such times that the quiet , thinking happiness , the peace as lively as hope , was in him , making a light through his face . It was like making a prayer that worked inside to put a hand on his shoulder then , and feel his thin body warm with sun , through the blue work shirt . He always thought of Arthur as watching Joe Sam in sunlight , in the spring , really , when the sun was just warm and full of promise , and the little movements of cool wind came up from the green meadows , and the pines on the mountain stood perfectly still and glistened softly in the new light . It made the loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you also remembered the dead face on the pillow , that already could never have been alive . It tore you in two directions ; it made it impossible to get across the space between . Harold bowed his head a little and gripped the two stakes fiercely . When the intolerable tearing was over , and the ghosts of the two parts flowed together again , he drew a deep breath and loosened his hold and looked up . In the half-aliveness that remained , he was capable only of pity among the strong feelings , but his vision was cleared like that of a man who has rid himself , for a time , of prejudice and memory , so that what he sees is all new and strange . Joe Sam had trampled the snow down in a wide circle with the big boots . He was standing in the center of the circle , with the grain measure in his arm , and the chickens were crowding around him . They were all kinds , gray and red and black and crossed , and the harder colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made bright flecks and spots upon the soft colors of the feathery mass . The two fierce , painted little bantams darted back and forth on the edge of the crowd , picking up the grains that fell outside . Arthur had brought the bantams all the way from the Carson Valley . They were his favorites , and they were Joe Sam 's favorites too . Curt always snorted about the bantams . " No damn use at all , " he 'd say . " One egg a week , abig as your thumb . " Joe Sam fanned the grain out slowly and thinly , a handful at a time . It was the motion of a man sowing seed who likes to do it , and has a feeling that the act is holy and should be thoughtp164about . Only it was even slower than that , with long pauses between sweeps when Joe Sam 's hand waited above the measure and he solemnly watched the chickens turning and pecking about him . He looked from one to another of them , considering each by itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not finding anything , would he slowly fan out the next handful onto the snow . It took Joe Sam a long time to feed the chickens this way . He was nearly done now , though . He was already holding the last handful for the part of the ceremony he liked best . He squatted and set down the measure on the snow beside him . Then he divided the last handful , and holding half of it out in each hand , close to the snow , began to make a soft , continuous sound through his teeth , now clucking , now whistling . The bantams at once stopped hunting around on the edge of the flock and came running to him , forcing their way boldly among the big chickens that had shut them out before . The cock began to strike quickly at the grain in his right hand and the hen at the grain in his left . The other chickens knew better than to push into this final rite . It was just for the bantams , and all the time it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whistling , and at the same time grinned with a faint , malicious pleasure to feel their tiny beaks darting against his palms . When they had taken the last grains , he stood up slowly , still grinning , and stopped the coaxing sounds , and held out his hands , palms down , to show they were empty . The little cock reared and beat the air before him with his wings and crowed exultantly in his high , thin voice . Joe Sam laughed out loud . The same happy malice was in the laugh that was in the grin , and a pride like the bantam cock 's as well.  --  " Shoo , " he said finally , and waved first the bantams , and then all the rest of the flock , away from him . The small magic of the ceremony dissolved , and it was hard to tell what had made it in the first place . Joe Sam picked up the measure and went slowly out of the chicken run , dragging the big boots so they made channels in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its wire loop , and plodded on up to the store room at the south end of the shed . Harold went up after him . Watching the feeding , and rememberingArthur watching it , had cleaned the last anger out ofp165him . He had to remind himself , with an effort , that Joe Sam still had the bottle neck somewhere , and of what he had already done with it . The store room was shadowy and cold and full of the smells of grain and of the new wood that was stacked up along the east wall . Joe Sam was standing by the grain bins , holding up the big lid that covered them all . " We better take some boards up with us , to make the coffin , Joe Sam , " Harold said . " It 's too cold to work down here . " Joe Sam looked at him without expression , and waited . " Make box for Arthur , " Harold explained . " To bury him . " " Make box , " Joe Sam said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lid down . Harold chose five long boards that were still white from the saw and plane . He drew them out of the pile and laid them one on top of the other on the floor . He brought the tool tray from the bench under the cobwebby front window and set it on top of the boards . Then he signed to Joe Sam to take the other end . They carried the boards out and set them down in the snow while Harold closed the store room . Then they picked them up again , and went slowly , with several stops to let Joe Sam rest or get a new hold , across the yard and up the hill to the bunk-house . In the bunk-house , Harold built up the fire again . " Better get your clothes on now , Joe Sam , " he said , and waited until the old man had taken off the big dust coat and the boots and begun to dress beside the stove . Then he hung up the coat on the wall by the wash stand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for a moment , watching Joe Sam , but the old Indian seemed to be away in his mind again , and not noticing anything around him , so he went outside and up to the woodpile , and came back with two sawhorses . He set the sawhorses up in the middle of the room and laid the first hoard across them , and a saw , a folding rule , a square and a blue pencil on the board . Then he looked at Joe Sam again . 1 le was sitting on the box beside the stove , slowly pulling on a sock . He had set his breakfast down on the floor beside the box . Harold crossed to the water bucket and dipped himself a glass of water . This time he looked at Joe Sam in the mirror.  |p166The  old man was very small , and way back there on his box , in the mirror , but Harold could see that he was pulling on a moccasin now , and not paying any attention to anything else . Harold raised the glass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old dust coat , hiding the search with his body . There was nothing solid in the dust coat . It hung flat and limp , and was getting damp now from the snow melting on it . Harold finished his drink , set the glass down , and went to the window , where he pretended to be looking down at the house . As he turned back , he took a quick look into the trash keg in the corner . The bottle neck was there again , lying on top of all the smaller pieces . He smiled a little at the way he was setting tricks of his own against Joe Sam 's now , and took off his cap and mackinaw and hung them up . Then he went back to the board across the two sawhorses . As long as he knew where that bottle neck was , that was the thing . As long as it did n't show up where he did n't expect it . There 'd be some chance to get rid of it for good when the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was sober again , if that was what made the difference . He stood looking down at the board and thought for a minute . Then he unfolded the yellow rule along the edge of it , and began to mark off the length he wanted . Joe Sam had finished dressing now . He crossed slowly to his bunk and sat down on the edge of it and watched the work . He followed every move with his good eye , but did n't appear to be really paying attention to any of them . " You better eat something , " Harold said . " Maybe , soon , " Joe Sam said , and did n't move . " Well , it ca n't get any colder now , that 's sure , " Harold said . He laid the square across the board at the end of the length he 'd measured , and made a quick slash along it with the pencil . He started the saw against the square too , and when it had cut a fine groove to hold the teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the rasping of the saw began , loud and rhythmical in the closed room . The sawdust fell in little , soundlessspurts from the cut , and in the window behind Harold , the thinning snow fell soundlessly also , and always slower and slower . It was just floating now , as if it were being let down carefully and all together.  |p167It  was about one o'clock when Gwen came up with coffee and sandwiches . Harold tried to get Joe Sam to eat , but the old man just looked up at him slowly , and as if he did n't really see him , and said , " Maybe , soon , " and looked back down at the curly shavings under the plank . " No use trying to make him eat when he 's like this , " Harold said , and set the plate and cup down on the box beside the untouchedbreakfast . Gwen turned back toward the door , and Harold asked , " Flow 's everything going down there now ? " " All right , I guess , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right away , then , do you ? " " Well , " Gwen said , " I could stay a little while , I guess . " She came around the planks laid out on the sawhorses and sat down on Harold 's bunk . She smiled up at him quickly , and looked away again quickly . After a moment she said , " It 's awfully hot in here , " and stood up and took off her cloak and laid it carefully over the foot of the bunk . Then she sat down again , with her hands together in her lap . Harold sat down on one of the planks , where it crossed the sawhorse nearest to her , and began to eat his lunch . When they looked at each other at the same time , they both smiled , but they did n't try to talk . It was too quiet in the bunk-house , and both of them felt Joe Sam there too much . They kept looking at him , first one of them and then the other . When Harold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lunch and set them on the plank , and began to break the food into a little pile of scraps on one plate , crumbling the bread in with the rest . " We might as well give it to his birds , " he said . " He 's even forgotten them , this time . He most generally puts grain out back for them , when it snows. "  |p168He  stacked the used dishes together on the plank and picked up the plate of scraps and the cup of coffee , and they went out together . Harold emptied the coffee into the snow , and led the way around to the back corner of the bunk-house . There he gave the plate to Gwen , and with short steps going around and in , in a spiral , he stamped the snow firm over a small circle . When he was done , Gwen scattered the food onto the packed surface . Her hands worked quickly and deftly at the little task . Her yellow blouse was bright as fire against the snow and the dark edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its thin crystals on the heavy coil of her hair . Harold stood there watching her all the time . When she finished , she stood for a moment looking at the birds that were already appearing in the nearest trees , and then turned and came back to him . He took the plate from her gently , looking down at her face and smiling a little all the time , and dropped the plate and the cup into the new snow behind him . They made a small , muffled clatter against each other , but neither Gwen nor Harold heard it . He took her hands and drew her slowly against him and bent his face down to hers . After the long kiss , he pushed her off a little , and kissed her lightly on the forehead , meaning to let her go . He could n't , though , but suddenly drew her closer again and kissed her repeatedly on the cheeks and eyelids and throat , and at last on the mouth again . He bent her back under this kiss , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other desperately , with their eyes closed and their hands beseeching . The many little black caps and chickadees and the two orange towees that had been waiting fluttered down and hopped into the circle , one at a time , and then two and three together , and began to pick quickly about among the scraps . A downy woodpeckerwent twice around the big pine that was nearest on the other side of the circle , making a faint , rhythmical scratching on the bark . Then he walked straight down it for a few feet , launched out , and lit abruptly by the morsel he 'd chosen . A big , black-crested jay came down onto the corner of the roof and stalked about in small circles , complaining stridently . Three more jays arrived in the big pine and hitched and scoldedp169too , one on the lowest branch and the other two on the second branch above him . It was Gwen who finally gently pushed Harold from her and shook her head at him . Harold lifted the pushing hands to his lips , pressing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hunger came on Gwen 's face again as she looked down at his head , but after a moment she whispered , " No , no , " and kissed his hair quickly and lightly and drew her hands free . " I have to go back now , Harold . " He stood looking down at her again , with a little , one-sided smile like Arthur 's . Finally he just nodded and touched her arm with his fingertips . Then he turned and dug the cup and plate up out of the snow . " I 'll get the rest of the dishes , " he said huskily . They stood looking at each other again , and then , suddenly Gwen 's eyes filled with tears . " Honey , honey , " Harold said , and would have moved to her again , but she held him off , gently but stubbornly . " No , Harold , please . " " No , " he said finally , and tried to smile . He stepped back to let her go ahead of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big gesture , as if he were opening a way through a crowd for her . Then he turned and followed close behind her , glancing down at the house as he did so . He was n't thinking about it at first , but after an instant he really saw what he was looking at , and something pierced swiftly and coldly into him . Small , not quite real , a puppet in the box of the closed stage down there , the iuother was standing in the north window , watching them . Her face was only a tiny , blank oval , but he knew how it looked . He knew what she was thinking as if he could hear her saying it , and the knowledge separated him from Gwen . A quick , murderousfury leapt up in him , but it was partly the fury of a culprit caught in the act . He looked away from the north windowat once . Behind them , the scolding jays came down into the circle , and the blackcaps and chickadees and towees fluttered away . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on picking at what he wanted . The jays left a clear circle of snow around him , but they were angry because they had to dop170it , and squabbled loudly with each other . Two of the chickadees came back down and started to feed again . They kept close to the woodpecker , and the jays let them alone too . " Mother 's watching us , " Harold said . " Is she ? " Gwen said absently . Then she said , " Oh , " and that little sound coming by itself afterwards told him the cold blade had struck into her too . He did n't want to look down at the north window again , but he saw Gwen glance down , and then away again quickly , and he began to feel that he was even walkingawkwardly . In spite of himself , he looked again as they went around the corner to the front of the bunk-house . The dark puppet with the white patch of face was still there in the window . Gwen stopped outside the door and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her . " Will it make her awfully angry , Hal ? " she asked . " Do n't you care about it , " he said . " Do n't you care , no matterwhat she says . " After a moment , Gwen said , " It was pretty bad , was n't it ? I mean now ? She 'd think it was ? " " What was ? " he asked angrily . " What did we do that was so awful ? " " It 's what she 's thinking about it , " Gwen said tonelessly . " I do n't think she likes me very much anyway , and now ... " There was n't anything good to say to her that was true . After a time , he turned and stared down at the house . His fists were doubled , and the fury came out in his words , though quietly . " Just because she 's never been anything but a whore and a slave , just because that 's all it 's ever meant to her , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she even . . . " He turned back and saw Gwen standing there , perfectly still , staring at his face , and the anger turned cold in him . Gradually he knew what it was that he 'd said , and heard a little how it must have sounded to her . " Well , " he said finally , " she 's seen us now , and she ca n't pretendabout it any more . The sooner we get it over with , the better . Wait 'll I get the dishes . " Gwen turned her back to the house and stood there while he went in and picked up her cloak and the dishes and came back.  | " If you 'll take these for a minute , " he said , " I 'll put your cloak on . " She took the dishes without looking at him , and turned her hack to him , and waited . He laid the cloak gently over her shoulders , and then , because he had to do something more , drew the hood up over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still had hold of the hood , he leaned past her shoulder until he could see her face inside , in the shadow , and smiled at her . She would n't smile back , though , and after a moment he could n't smile either . He straightened and walked stiffly back and closed the door . When he turned again , Gwen was already going down toward the house , carrying the dishes . He could n't hurry after her and try to take them from her when she had done that , so he just followed her down , feeling that he had alreadylostall that would matter in the trouble he was sure was coming . When they entered the kitchen , Grace was sitting by herself at the table , holding Arthur 's little carving of a sheepherder carrying a lamb over his neck . She was n't really looking at it , though . She was staring at the edge of the table , and then she looked up at them . Before any of them could speak , the mother appeared in the bedroom door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was holding it together at the throat with one hand . She looked only at Harold , and she spoke to him as if Gwen were n't there . " I saw you up there with her . " " Did you ? " Harold said . He took the dishes from Gwen , and walked slowly over and set them down on the sink shelf . He did it carefully , so they could n't see how he was trembling . " How could I help it ? " the mother asked , in the deep voice like a man 's . " Playin ' with your little whore right out in plain sight , and your brother not yet in his grave . " Harold turned around and took hold hard on the edge of the sink shelf behind him , with both hands . " You could maybe pick your words a little better , " he said softly . " You 've done the pickin ' for me , I 'd say . Your pa called her a dirty , foreign little mucker 's brat . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the least of what she is . I never been one top172mince my words , when they tell the truth . Whore is what I called her , and whore is what I meant . I 'm sayin ' only what has to be said , and you 'll listen to me . " " Get it all said quick then . " The mother stared at him . " I 'd send her packin ' this minute , " she said finally , " only I wo n't have it on my conscience she got put out in this storm by herself . And you ca n't take her home now . You 'll have to finish the coffin , and with Curt gone , you 'll have to dig the grave too . She can get her things together and take them up to the bunk-house , and wait there till you 're ready . If she ... " " That 'll do , " Harold said . Gwen said scornfully , " Never mind , Harold . I 'm going , and I wo n't need any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the buryin 's done , " the mother said . " We 'll go now , " Harold said . " Curt can dig the grave whenhe gets back , and finish the coffin too . If you think ... " Gwen turned away suddenly toward the door . " You better take your things up with you , " the mother said . Gwen went on toward the door . It was Grace 's voice that stopped her . " Mother , you 're making a n-45ty , filthy lid out of nothing. , It 's you that 's shaming Arthur , not Gwen . And not Harold either . " They 'd nearly forgotten she was there , and even Gwen stopped and turned , astonished by the sharp voice . They all stared at Grace . She was standing behind the chair now , gripping the back of it with both hands so hard her knuckles were white . Her face was white too , and her eyes were very wide , and dark and shining . She was staring at the mother . " What 's Gwen done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be always talking as if you were God around here . " The mother slowly let go of her shawl and gripped her two hands together in front of her . " Do n't blaspheme , girl . " " Me blaspheme ? " Grace cried . She lifted her face for a momentat the rafters , and laughed shrilly . " Me blaspheme ? " she cried again , staring at the mother , and even leaning a little toward her , as if about to spring , though still clutching the back of the chair . " Grace , " Harold said , moving toward her with his hand out.  | " Do n't you touch me , " she cried , but still holding the mother with her staring eyes . " Do n't any of you touch me . Oh , God , I 've needed to say this . We all need to . Even the house needs to . It 's rotten with lies and greed and bad dreams . Arthur knew ; oh , how he knew . But he was too kind-hearted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make little jokes that told the truth ifyoulistened to them . But you and your God do n't hear little jokes . And Curt and Father do n't even have a God , not any kind . Only money . Only self-importance and wanting their own way , and money , money , money . And there is n't any use for money around here , or anything to be important about . So all Father wants now is to be drunk and pretend he 's not here , and Curt wants to kill everything ; he wants everything in the valley dead but Curt . He was happy when he found those steers dead . Did n't you see that , you old fool ? Could n't you hear that when he talked about it ? They were dead already , and it gave him an excuse to kill something else too . " And think how happy he was when he found Arthur out there . He let him go out there alone , did n't he ? He sent him out there , so he could come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill anything . He knew he 'd get to do that too . And that is n't all ; that 's just the end of it . He 's been robbing Arthur for years . He 's taken Arthur 's share time after time , with your blessing , and your God 's , and Father 's too . To improve the ranch , he says . Oh , yes , but his ranch , his . You do n't think he ever means it to be anything else , do you ? " " Grace , " the mother said sharply . " Oh , yes , he has , " Grace cried triumphantly . " You know it , but as long as nobody says it , you can pretend you do n't . Well , now I 'm saying it , and you 'll listen to it , too . I do n't care what happens any more . What does it matter what happens now ? Arthur 's dead . You do n't even seem to know that , any of you . Arthur 's dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And Curt killed him . He wanted him dead , and now he 's killed him . Oh , yes , he has , just as sure as if he 'd shot him . And lie 's glad of it , do you hear me ? He 's dancing for joy out there . lie was afraid of Arthur ; Arthur was all that kept him from selling the whole valley right out from under us . He would n't fight for himself , but he would for the rest of us , and Curt knewp174it . He could n't sell us out with Arthur alive , so he killed him . Now he can do what he wants . There 's nobody he 's afraid of now . Oh , he 's glad . Do n't you ever think he is n't . And he can kill his painter and be a hero , too . He has everything , and all with the blessing of your wicked , selfish , ugly God . " She paused , breathing hard and quickly , and none of them could speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , though , the father 's deep voice spoke from the landing above . " What 's going on down there ? " The others were freed a little , and even in Grace herself the frightened hatred was checked . She was about to go on , but did n't . They all looked up at the old man , the mother moving out of the doorway to see him . He appeared huge up there in the shadow . His hair was on end in the little flame shapes and his clothes were creased and twisted from his restless sleep . He was holding himself steady with his left hand on the rail , and cradling a new whisky bottle in his right arm , like a baby . " You all deaf ? " he asked . " What 's going on ? I want to know . All this screaming ? " He stared down through narrowed eyes at Grace . " Do n't ask me , " Grace cried . " Ask Mother . " She pointed at the mother . " Ask her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your daughter has been screaming blasphemous nonsense , " the mother said stiffly . " But we 've listened to about enough of it now , I think . " She turned to Grace . " You get back in that bunk-room and stay there till you can keep a decent tongue in your head . " " Screaming nonsense , have I ? " Grace cried at her . She looked up again at the old man on the landing . " She 's sending Gwen home . And she 's sending her up to the bunk-house to wait . She 's sending her up there where she 'll have Joe Sam for company , and he 's drunk , and God only knows what he 'll do . And then . . . The mother 's voice came over hers , saying fiercely , " Grace , you get back in that bunk-room . You hear me ? " " Lettie , " the father said angrily , " have you gone crazy ? She ca n't stay up in that bunk-house with that old fool . Nobody knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these idiot spells . What on earth gave you such a notion ? "  |p175Nobody  answered him . Nobody could answer that question when he asked it from up there , like a chairman on a platform . " What did she do ? I asked you . " " Yes , ask her , " Grace cried . " She 's the eye of God . She 's the one that saw it . " " Saw what ? " " Awful things , " Grace cried . " She saw them from the win-dow . " Gwen made a little , choking sound , and turned suddenly toward the door again . " No , Gwen , " Harold cried . She was already struggling blindly with the latch when he caught her . She wrestled to free herself , but kept working at the latch too , and crying , " Let go of Inc . Let go of me , I tell you . " Finally , breaking half-free , she struck at him , so that he had to let go . She got the latch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stumbled out , beginning to weep so they could hear her . Outside , on the snow , Haroldcaught her again , pleading , " Gwen , Gwen . " The others , watching through the open door , saw her face turned up at him furiously , her eyes blind with tears , and heard her cry , " You God-Almighty Bridges . There 's nobody good enough for you , is there ? To hell with you all too , then . I 'll get my dirty , foreign muck out of here so fast . . . " Her voice broke , choked off by a sob , and Harold , holding her with both bands now , said something they could n't hear , still pleading with her . " No , " Gwen cried , twisting harder to get free . " No , you wo n't . I 'll go by myself . Let go of me , will you ? Even a whore would n't take any help from you now , not any of you . " The mother crossed to the outside door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she said , " We 've heard about enough of that , I guess . What decent woman would be screaming things like that ? " Grace cried up at the father , " She was only saying what Mother called her , and you . Mother called her a whore . " " I saw them , " the mother said in the deep voice . " Eh ? " the old man said . " Saw who ? " he asked . " Those two out there . That little easy woman , and your son . " The father lurched against the rail , bending dangerously farp176over it , but then pushed himself up again . " Easy woman ? " he asked . " That Gwendolyn Williams . You get back to bed now , Pa . You ai n't fit to be up . I 'll take care of this nonsense . " The old man still stood there above them , though , searching in the mist of his mind , repeating Gwen 's name twice in a question to himself . At last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . Curt 's intended . " After a moment , he frowned and said heavily , like a man who is very patient but pushed near his limit , " And what 's she done now ? " " There 's no need to bother now , " the mother said . " She'stook care of it herself . You heard her . You go finish your sleep . " " What 's she done ? I asked you , " the father said loudly . " What would you expect a whore to do ? " " Do n't you believe her , " Grace cried . " She says she saw them . All right , then , make her tell you what she saw , not just keep calling her names . " " Grace , " the mother said , starting away from the door , " did you hear what I told you ? I ai n't gon na say it again . " " Make her tell you , " Grace cried . " Yes , by God , " the father said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , not this time , not after all this uproar . You tell me now , you hear ? " The mother stopped by the table , and turned up at him the knife face her will made in anger . " You want to know ? You want to make me talk about such things ? All right , then . They was actin ' up right up by the bunk-house , in broad daylight . I seen ' em myself , from the bedroom window . And Arthur lyin ' right there beside me , not a day dead . Is that the kind of a woman you want in your house ? Is that the kind you want your own son marryin ' ? " " No , by God , " the father began . " She 's lying again , " Grace cried . " Ca n't you see she 's lying ? Acting like what ? " she cried at the mother . " Acting like what ? " the father repeated . " Yes , " he said , with sudden rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wo n't stand any more of this goddam lying , you hear me ? " " I 'll get Harold , " Grace cried triumphantly . " He 'll tell you . " But the father had come upon something sure in his ownp177mind . He chuckled . Grace and the mother both stared up at him . He leaned over the rail and grinned at the mother , blinkingslowly , and shook his head three or four times . " No , they would n't , " he said . He chuckled again . " Not in all that snow , they would n't . " " If Harold had n't seen me watching them . . . " the mother began . " You see ? " Grace cried at the father . " If , ' she says . She did n't see anything . " " She was kissing him , " the mother declared , " and the way no decent woman ... " " Kissing , " the father said loudly . He lurched again , and again caught himself on the rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kissing , " he said again , his head jerking from the violence with which he said the word . " Now , you listen to me , old woman . " He worked himself around and started down the stairs , taking them one at a time and with the help of the rail , but as fast as he could . He was breathing hard through his nose . " And for that she calls her a whore , " Grace cried . " Grace , " the mother said , the little furies dancing behind her ryes , " I told you to keep out of this , and I ai n't gon na tell you again . You 've made trouble enough already . " " I 've made trouble ? " Grace cried . The father did n't seem to hear either of them . His anger had already sunk into a muttering petulance against the stairs . He 'd heard the words , though . At the foot of the stairs , leaning against the rail , he said , " All women are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mastered the stairs , and now his own words pleased him too . He repeated them . " Yessir , all women are whores at heart . " He chuckled . " Harold , " the mother said . " Only , " he said , " some 's honest whores , and some gets religin . " He made a foolish , thin little laugh . " You got a good enough price yourself , old woman , " he said , grinning . " The best of them would have settled for clothes and a carriage , but what did you charge me , huh ? I 'll tell you what you charged me . My life , that 's what you charged me , my whole damn life . vb And no fun for my money either . " " I ai n't gon na stand here . . . " the mother began.  | " Oh , yes , you are , " he said . He lurched a little , and thrust his head forward . " It 's a fact , " he said grinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no damn good . A clothes-pin in bed , a goddam , ' normous , wooden clothes-pits . There . " He nodded happily , and uncorked the bottle and lifted it to his lips with his head tilted back . " Got ta keep drinkin ' , " he burbled around the bottle , " just ' to forget the goddam , ' normouswooden clothes-pin . " The mother stared at him . Her face was gray , and the grooves of time and labor and war with herself grew deeper while she stood there . Finally she spoke slowly , and almost as thickly as he had spoken . " Is that all it means to you , a lifetime of slavin ' and lookin ' out for you , and bearin ' you four young uns ? " The father let the bottle down a little and said cheerfully , " That 's all , " and lifted the bottle and drank again . Then he lowered it all the way and corked it . He cradled it in his arm once more and leaned across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too drunk to know what I 'm saying . Not though . Everybody saying just what they think , so I am too . Know what I 'm saying . Just what I think . " He began the whinnying laugh again , but broke it off short as his head drooped and rolled toward his shoulder . He jerked it up after a moment and peered at the mother . She had n't moved from where she 'd been standingthe whole time . All at once Grace stirred herself . She crossed swiftly to the foot of the stairs and stood right below the old man . " Father , " she said , and then again , " Father . " Finally the father 's head turned slowly , and he squinted to see her too . " What you want ? " " You wo n't let her send Gwen away , will you ? " " No , " the old man said , speaking angrily , because she asked the question so urgently . " Course not . Stay if she wants to . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You wo n't let Mother keep her up there in the bunk-house with Joe Sam ? " " Course not , " the old man said . " My house . Have who I want in it . " Still standing there on the other side of the table , the mother asked slowly , " You want a woman like that in your house ? "  |p179For  a moment the old man did n't seem to understand where the question had come from . Then he let his head roll back again , and peered at the mother . " Eh ? " he asked . " What 's that ? " " I asked do you want that kind of a woman in your house ? ' The father kept staring at her till it seemed he had n't understood , or had already forgotten the question . Then suddenly he chuckled , and leaned over loosely and pointed at her . " Clothespin , " he said . " You damn right , " he said . " Got ta have whore Ulna house anyway , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . Not a damn clothes-pin . " " If that 's the last word you have . . . " the mother began heavily . " Father , " Grace cried . She put her hand over his on the rail . " You ca n't just say that . She 's got to apologize . Mother 's got to apologize . Gwen ca n't ... " " Grace , " the mother said , " ai n't you heard enough . . . " " Father , " Grace said again . " Shut up , " the father said suddenly and loudly . " Both of you shut up , " he said . " Clothes-pins , both of you . Not women at all . Not human . Goddam clothes-pins . " The room was very quiet for a moment , save for his loud , enraged breathing . Then the anger passed slowly from his face . He appeared to have remembered something which made him very sad . " Man 's got ta have a drink , anyway , " he said finally , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cork of his bottle . Suddenly he stopped and frowned . " Yes , " he said to himself . " ' Pologize . You hear me , old woman , " he said , staring at the mother . " You ' pologize . Good girl . Only one around here does anything . Got my breakfast even . Curt 's intended too . Then you call her names like that . You ' pologize . Understand ? " The mother just stared back at him . " You hear me , woman ? " he yelled . " I hear you . Anybody could hear you , up to the crick . " " All right . You better . You ' pologize . Go ' pologize now . Un-derstand ? " " No , " the mother said finally . " You can do as you please with her . From now on you can all do as you please about everything . Only I warn you , " she said , her voice rising a little , andp180the tiny furies beginning to dance in her eyes again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She came quickly around the table , not looking at either of them , and stalked into the bedroom and across it , and stood in front of the north window . She stood there for a long time , with her back turned to the door , and her arms down stiffly at her sides . The father carefully let himself down until he was seated on the second step , and got his bottle uncorked again , and drank from it . Grace waited at the foot of the stairs , still clinging to the newel post . The old man wiped the trickling liquor from his chin with his sleeve and then corked the bottle again . " Curt 's intended , " he said mournfully . " Talk about her own son 's intended that way . Be Curt 's wife . " Grace closed her eyes and leaned her forehead against the post for a moment . In the bedroom the mother let herself down into her chair and took the big Bible into her lap , but then did not open it , but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Grace opened her eyes and sighed , and came around to the foot of the stairs . She knelt below the old man , and put a hand on his knee . " Father , " she said softly . " Eh ? " " We must n't let Mother send Gwen away . She has to apologize , or Gwen 'll go , Father . " " Course , " the old man agreed . " Said so , did n't I ? Curt 's in-tended . " " Harold 's , Father . " " Eh ? " said the old man . " What ? " He thought about it . " ' Sright , " he said finally , " Harold 's . " He seemed cheered by the discovery . " Better , " he said , nodding . " Much better . Curt marry some decent American girl now , not little foreign whore . " Slowly Grace took her hand from his knee and stood up . She stood for a minute staring down at him , and then turned and started toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the stove , she stopped and began to turn around , but then changed her mind again . Very slowly , like one feeling her way , she went to the table and stood with her hands on the back of the mother 's chair . Finally she leaned over and pickedp181tip Arthur 's little carving of the sheepherder , but listlessly , as if it did n't matter to her . Then she turned and went on into the bunk-room and closed the door very slowly and quietly . The old man sat alone on the stairs , cradling his bottle . A tong time passed , with only the clock and the fire sounding in the room . Then he spoke . " Not going upstairs , " he said stubbornly . He hoisted himself to his feet and worked down the last step and around the post carefully . He made his way to the table in one tack , and then , keeping a hand on the table , got around to his place and pulled out his chair . He sank into the chair suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in his arm , his chin sunk into the folds of his neck . A long time later , he suddenly aroused himself , and looked about as if someone had spoken . " That you , Curt ? " he asked . " Damn clock , " he said finally . " Goddam clock , always tickin ' . " He tried to uncork his bottle again , but gave it up this time . Ile lowered the bottle slowly onto the floor beside his chair . Then he let his arms slide out onto the table in front of him and pillowed his head on his right arm . Once in a while , after that , he muttered something , a protest or a lament , to the empty kitchen , but most of the time there was only his heavy breathing and the clock and the fire . Toward dusk the snow really began to come down again outside , thickly and silently , In big flakes . It was nearly dark when Harold came in . He stopped in the doorway to shake the snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his boots . Then he stood there peering into the shadowyroom . Only the little worms and butterflies of light from the stove moved and were distinct , but he made out the bulk of the father asleep on his arms on the table . " Come in , Joe Sam , " he said . " And close the door . "  |p182He  crossed to the stove and got matches . The old Indian enteredsilently and closed the door and remained there against it . Harold lighted the lamp and slid it up again . Then he looked back at Joe Sam . The old man had on a coat that was much too big for him , and a black sombrero with a flat crown . There was a blue bandana tied around his head under the sombrero . I I is braids hung down from it , and the loose braid was all unbound now and spread over his shoulder . The new snow still clung to him , and was thick on his shoulders and hat . Harold started to speak to him , but heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a quick scratching in there , and a white light showed through the open doorway and grew stronger and steadier . He took a deep breath and straightened himself , and crossed to the doorway . The mother was bending over the lamp , slowly bringing the wick up to where she wanted it . " We 're going now , " Harold said . The mother waited until she had the wick set . Then she drew herself slowly erect , and turned to face him . " Going where ? " " To Williams ' . " The mother just stood there , dark against the light of the lamp . " The coffin 's finished , " Harold said , " and the grave 's dug . We dug it up back , on the hill . But it 's too late for the funeral now . I 'll be back tomorrow , if I can make it . " " You 'll be back ? " " For the funeral . " Finally the mother said , " You do n't have to go . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The mother waited even longer this time , but finally said , " You ca n't go now , not with it snowing again . " " You did n't leave us much choice , " Harold said . " Gwen 'd go without me . You do n't think I 'd let her do that , do you ? " " You could wait till morning , anyway . " " In the bunk-house ? " The mother was silent for a long time again , but he just waited . At last she said , " You 'd leave us with everything this way ? "  | " There 's not much choice , is there ? " " No , " the mother said slowly , " I guess there ai n't . " Then she said bitterly , " Seems like I 'm always the one that 's wrong . " Harold 's mind flared , but he thought , No more of that , and just waited again . After a minute , the mother turned away from his stare and stood looking down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisting her hands together . " I 'm half out of my mind , " she said . " I been thinkin ' all clay somethin 's happened to Curt too . Could be I spoke too quick . " Could be , Harold thought grimly , and still would n't help her . The mother let her hands down to her sides , and turned kick to face him . " I do n't guess it matters much what I say now . Bring the girl down here , if that 's what she wants . " I-Iarold stared at her . At last he said softly , " It 's not what she wants . All she wants is to go home . She was n't even going to let me go with her . " " You need n't of been too much afeard of that , I guess . " When Harold spoke this time , it was even more softly . " Allright , then , if that 's the way you like it . " He turned , and saw ( ; race standing by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harold , " the mother said . Ile waited , with his back to her . " I said more than I should of , I guess , " she said . " Do you want I should go up and tell her that ? " He turned to face her again , but then Grace was beside him , saying , " You 'd better let Harold go , Mother , or me . " " You 'll have to beg her pardon , " Harold said . " Oh , she will , " Grace said quickly . " You will , wo n't you . Mother ? " " I 'm not the only one around here that said too much . " " I know , I know . I said terrible things , Mother , and I'msorry . But you 'll say that much to Gwen too , wo n't you ? Thatyou 're sorry ? We ca n't let her go like this , Mother . " " No , " the mother said slowly , " seems like we ca n't . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The mother nodded . " I 'll go get her to come down . " Before either of the othersp184could speak , she ran over to the pegs by the door and took down the first coat she got hold of , and struggled into it . It was Curt 's red mackinaw , and it was much too big for her . She had trouble getting her hands out of the sleeves far enough to open the door . Harold started toward her , saying , " Grace , wait , " but before he could get to her , she had the door open . " Grace , " he said again . " No , Harold , you better let me , " she said , and slipped out into the snowy darkness , and closed the door . Harold opened the door and called after her , " Grace , " but she did n't answer . He went outside and called , " Grace , take it easy . " She did n't answer this time either , and he could n't see her out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but then stopped . After a moment he went on again , more slowly , and stopped at the corner , and stood there looking up at the lighted bunk-house window . He saw the angle of light when the door opened , and Grace 's small , dark figure go in , and then there was only the window showing again . He waited there , staring up into the darkness , until a gust of wind full of snow blinded him . He bent his head against it , and when it eased off , turned and went back slowly . The kitchen door was still open . He went in and closed it behind him . He was startled , then , to see Joe Sam looking at him out of the shadowy corner between the bunk-room door and the stove . He had forgotten that the old Indian was in there . He was half-sitting on the wood-box , with his hands hanging limp between his knees , and he still had on the big coat and the black sombrero . " You better take off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We wo n't get at the chores for a while yet . " The good eye , gleaming steadily in the shadow , seemed to be looking at him , but Joe Sam just sat there , and did n't answer . Harold did n't want to say anything more , with the father asleep there under the lamp , and the white light in the door of the north bedroom , but everything quiet in there too . He went slowly over to the table , and pulled out Arthur 's chair , lifting it so it would n't scrape , and setting it down again carefully too . He sat down in it and looked at the big , gray head in the circle of light , and the little , flame-shaped locks standing up on it . I ought to get him up to bed , he thought . If he wakes upp185when they come back , and puts in his two-bits ' worth , but then put that idea aside also , at the thought of the old man 's voice in the quiet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If only Grace do n't go at it the way she did at mother here , lie thought uneasily . Even if she gets Gwen to come clown that way , it 'll only set her dead against us . The waiting became very long with only the clock ticking and the slow , heavy snoring of the father . Well , he thought , I can see to their fire , anyway , and got up and went into the bunk-room , being as quiet as he could in his boots . The fire was out , and the room was cooling fast . There was a faint sweetness of women in the air that made the place strange , and made him feel like an intruder . The stool Gwen had sat on was still there beside Arthur 's bunk , and the hollow ( ; race 's head had made in the pillow was still there too . Arthur 's little carvings lay every which way in the wrinkles of the blankets . Gwen had n't left much mark of herself , though . She 'd used his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the top quilt pulled up over the pillow . The only thing he could see that belonged to her was the canvas satchel with the leather handles on it , and her initials stamped on the side of it in big , broken letters , G.A.W. The satchel was sitting in the middle of the neat bunk . It looked as if she had been thinking about going away all the time , or at least ever since the father had called her names , and accused her of causing the trouble . Harold wanted to go over and put his hands on the satchel , because it was hers , but it made him feel sneaky just to think about it , with that woman smell in the room , and Gwen so angry with him now . He stood looking at the satchel for a minute , and then went over to the stove and shook down the ashes and laid a new fire and lit it . When the small wood was burning surely , and he could begin to feel the heat working out , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into the kitchen . From in front of the stove , he could see that the mother was kneeling by the bed in the north room again . It made the quiet of the house more oppressive than ever to see her back at her praying , and it made him angry too . Half an hour of that , and we 'll be right back where we started from , he thought.  |p186He  moved over to the table and stood looking down at the father again , without seeing him . Finally he went into the store room and came back out with one arm full of potatoes . He closed the store-room door carefully , and almost tiptoed over to the sink board , and let the potatoes down onto it one at a time . Ile got out a pan and a paring knife and began to peel the potatoes slowly , taking off straight slices that were too thick , and putting the square , peeled potatoes into the pan . It got night dark in the windows while he worked , and the wind came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pines and slithering the snow across the panes . Then , finally , he heard the latch of the outside door click . He turned around quickly , and saw Gwen come in , and then Grace behind her . Grace 's face , looking at him over Gwen 's shoulder , was still too bright eyed and triumphantly pale , in the way he did n't trust , but Gwen looked at him out of the shadow of her hood and looked away again at once . She moved into the room a couple of steps , to let Grace in behind her , and then stood there , the way Joe Sam always did . " This is the worst yet , " Grace said , in that high , happy voice . She closed the door briskly , like a person with a thousand things to do and eager to be at them . " A little more and you could get lost between here and the bunk-house , " she said happily . " We could hardly see the light . " Gwen began to brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her cloak , and then leaned over to brush the heavier snow from the hem of her skirt . She did n't look at either of them . " I put some more wood in the stove for Joe Sam , " Grace said . " His fire 'll keep till bedtime . Is she in there still ? " she asked . Harold stood there holding the paring knife in one hand and a half-peeled potato in the other , and kept looking at Gwen . He just nodded to answer Grace . " Good heavens , Harold , " Grace cried , " you 're taking half the potato with the skin . You poor boy , peeling potatoes . You let them wait now . We 'll get our little formalities over with , and then Gwen and I 'll get supper in a couple of shakes . " While she spoke , she took off Curt 's red coat and hung it on the back of the chair nearest her , and then brushed at the snow on her skirt with the same busy cheerfulness her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she starts on Mother like that . " She 's praying again now , " he said . " Maybe we 'd better ... " " There 's no use putting it off , " Grace said . She came over and took the knife and the potato from him , and put them on the sink board . " Everything will go better once we get that settled , better for all of us . " She started toward the bedroom , her chin lifted a little , and that hopeful half-smile on her mouth . " Mother , " she called cheerfully . The father stirred and muttered in his sleep . Gwen said , " No , Grace , let her be . " Grace stopped in the bedroom doorway and turned around . The white , excited shining of her face was already beginning to fade . " There 's no use putting it off , " she said again , but not so quickly or so clearly . Gwen moved over into the light by the table , but still with her cloak on and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go for now , " she said . " She sent you up , and that 's good enough . " Nobody sent her , really , Harold thought . She took it all on herself . As if to speak for him , the mother 's voice , the deep voice like a man 's , said from tt doorway , " I did n't send her . It was her own idea . " Harold turned , and Grace moved over against the stairs quickly , and they were all three looking at the mother . The light behind her was stronger than the light in the kitchen , so they could see her face only dimly , but the tall figure in distinct silhouette , the narrow body rising out of the skirt that filled the lower part of the doorway . " I had a notion to come myself , " she said clearly , " hut Grace thought better not . I got a stiff tongue at the best of times , and it do n't limber up none owning I 'm wrong . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " No , no it ai n't , " the mother said , almost triumphantly . " I should of come myself . I been upset kind of , but that ai n't no excuse . I said more'n I meant , and I should of come myself . " " I know , " Gwen said . " I understand . " " No . I made a promise , and a promise I make , I keep . I want you should hear it from me . I would of come up there myself ,  |p188only  it seems like I ai n't to be trusted now , not even by my own children . There , I 've owned I said too much . You can put your pride away now , and maybe poor Arthur will get a little peace anyway . I wo n't hinder you no more , anything you want to do . Seems my ways , and the Lord 's too , for the matter of that , do n't hold around here no more . " Now she 's done it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gwen , " he said quickly , and turned toward her . But Gwen just stood very straight where she was , and looked back at the mother , and said , " If you want me to go , I 'm sure ... " " It 's not what I want any more , " the mother said . " As far as I 'm concerned , " Gwen began , but the father 's voice interrupted her , asking thickly and loudly , " What 's the matter ? What 's going on here ? " They all looked at him . He was holding his head up with difficulty , only a little off his arm , and peering across at them . But he did n't say anything else , and the mother looked at Gwen again . " Do n't talk like a fool , " she said . " You could n't go any place on a night like this if you wanted to . " She turned and went back into the bedroom . " What ails her now ? " the father asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Gwen , listen , " Harold said , coming beside her and taking hold of her arm gently . " It 's always nothing , " the father said angrily . " What 's she talkingabout ? I asked you . " " She meant it all right , at first , " Harold pleaded . " It 's only that she gets her pride up when she starts to talk . She knows she was wrong . And we want you to stay , we all do . You know that . " Gwen still would n't look at him , but she put her right hand out from under her cloak and patted his hand that was holding her arm . " She 's right enough about one thing , anyway , " she said . " We ca n't go now . So let 's not talk about it , shall we ? " She turned away from him and went quickly across to the clothes pegs , and stood there in front of them , with her back to the room.  | " Talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumped the table with his fist . " Please , Father , " Grace cried . " It 's all done with . " " All done with , is it ? Now , you listen to me , young lady , " he said angrily , and tried to rise , but lurched to the side and kicked over the whisky bottle . He looked down at it , and said , " Oh , oh , " and sat back in the chair again , and leaned over and picked up the bottle . He cradled it in his arm and began to pat it . " Almost spilled it , " he murmured . Gwen swung her cloak off suddenly and hung it up , and t tuned back to face them , saying , " It 's time we got some supper . " The father stopped patting the bottle and looked at her , startled . He watched her cross the room and pick up the knife and the half-peeled potato from the sink board . " There 's sensible girl , " he announced finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat , no matter what happens . " He thought about that . " Just time for one more little drink before we eat , " he said finally . He set the bottle on the table and sat forward and began trying to uncork it . Harold came to the side of his chair in two strides and took the bottle out of his hands and yanked the cork out so it popped loudly . Then he got a glass off the sideboard , poured it a third full , and set it in front of the old man . He corked the bottle , main , and set it down sharply beside the glass . The father 's red , searching eyes found him then . He nodded , making it almost a sitting bow . " Thank you , my boy , " he said . Ile raised his head heavily to look at Harold again , and then let it swing back down of its own weight . After a moment he remembered the glass of whisky and held it up and peered at it , grinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared . He drank half the whisky , and said , " Ah , " and set the glass down again . Harold looked at Grace . " I 'll get at the chores , " he said . " I 'll be done by the time supper 's ready . " He got the lantern from behind the stove and set it on the table and lit it . He put on his coat and cap , and came back for the lantern , and went to the door . When he opened the door , the cold wind sucked in and a thin sifting of snow came with it ,  |p190twisting  and sliding along the planks . The roaring of the pines came in loudly too . " Come on , Joe Sam , " Harold said . The old Indian rose from his seat on the wood-box and crossed the room silently , and went out past him into the noisy darkness . " He 'll be eating with us , " Harold said . " Set him a place too . " But if Mother . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , " Harold said . " She 'd damn well better , " he added , with sudden fierceness , and went out , closing the door so hard the window beside it rattled more than the wind was rattling it . When Harold and Joe Sam came in again , the father was alreadyeating . Grace straightened up by the table , with the coffeepot in her hand , and said , " Mother wants to see you . " " What about now ? " Grace shook her head . " I do n't know . She just said she wanted to see you as soon as you came in . " Harold took off his coat and cap and hung them up . " Did she eat any supper ? " he asked . Grace nodded . " She drank her coffee , and ate a little meat . " " Well , that 's something , " Harold said . " Go ahead , " he saidto them all , " I 'll be back in a minute , " and crossed to the bedroomdoor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the black shawl around her and her hands lying one upon the other in her lap . " Did you want to see me , Mother ? " Harold asked . The mother did n't look around , but said , " Come in here , will you ? There 's no use telling our troubles to the whole world . " Meaning Gwen , he thought , and went in and stood besidep191her , but looked over her at Arthur on the bed . It was n't like Arthur sleeping there now . The long , dark hair and beard looked false around the sinking face . He looks like an old man trying to be young , Harold thought . A skinny , mean , old man . With a pot belly , too , he thought , seeing how tight the black coat had become . We keep the room too warm . " We better have the funeral tomorrow , no matter what , " the mother said . " I guess we 'd better . " " If you and Joe Sam would bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then I could get it ready tonight , " she said . " It 's all ready . " " He ca n't lie on the bare boards , " the mother said , more in her old tone . " I want to line it with a quilt . " After a moment , he said , " Why do n't you just get the liningready , Mother , and I 'll put it in , first thing in the morning . " " I 'd like to do that much myself , if I 'm to be allowed now . " If you 're to be allowed , he thought , but finally said , " Allright , then . " " If you 'd just bring me down a hammer and tacks when you come . " Just what they need to listen to all night , he thought , but said , " All right , " again . " After you 've had your supper . " She began to rock the chair a little . Enjoying herself now , Harold thought . He turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harold . " " Yes ? " " Are there enough good boards for another ? " Jesus , he thought violently , all his anger coming up at once , the first time she does n't have everything her own way , she wants to bury us all . He did n't trust himself to answer , and , finally she looked up at him . Then he was n't so sure . If I 'm tired , he thought , think what she must be . " It 's no good trying to fool ourselves , " the mother said tonelessly . " Not after two days , and all this snow . " " He 's been out longer'n that , lots of times , Mother , " Haroldp192said . And if he does n't get back , he thought , we wo n't need any coffin . " It was never like this , " the mother said . " I know . I can feel it . Well , " she said , sighing , and looking away from him at tile proud unicorn in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now . It 's just I keep thinkin ' of things , settin ' here with nothin ' to keep me busy . " Then suddenly she buried her face in her hands , and cried thinly , " Oh , what have I done , that the i Lord should turn on me like this ? " For a moment Harold could only stare at her , his own will draining out with hers . Then he came back to her , trying to keep his boots quiet on the floor . He wanted to kneel beside her and put his arm around her , but even now he could n't make himself do that . He put his hand on her shoulder , timidly . " Mother , you got to get some sleep pretty quick . Why do n't you go in our room right now , and try and get some sleep ? There 'll be plenty of time for everything in the morning . " He closed the hand gently on her shoulder . " Please , Mother . " She shook her head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes closed and her hands in her lap , and Harold thought , That 's the way she was when I came in . She was n't taking it easy at all . " I ca n't sleep , " the mother said . " I 'm better with something to keep me busy . If you 'll just bring me those things when you come down . " After a moment , she added fretfully , " If only that wind would stop blowing . It keeps blowing the snow against the window all the time . " Finally Harold said , " Well , we 'll bring it down now . " " No , " she said , without opening her eyes , " there 's no such hurry as that about it . It 's way late for your supper now . You get something to eat first . " When he still did n't go , she added , " I 'm perfectly all right , I tell you . You go get your supper . " He thought , She 's poisoning herself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that either , and finally turned and went back out as quietly as he could . Grace and Gwen were already seated at the table , but they were waiting for him . Grace looked up at him , but saw his face and looked down again without asking the question . Joe Sam'sp193place was still empty . Harold looked around . The old Indian was sitting cross-legged on the floor , with his back against the wood-box . He still had on the big coat and the black sombrero . " Come on , Joe Sam , " Harold said . " Take off your things and pull up a chair . " Joe Sam did n't move . Not even the faint glitter of his eyes changed . Harold went over to him and leaned down and put a hand on his shoulder . Joe Sam came back slowly from the distance he was watching , and looked up . " Come to the table , " Harold said . " Eat supper . " " Table ? " Joe Sam asked . " It 's all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's arm . Joe Sam did it easily , not using his hands , or any help from Harold , but just uncrossing his feet and rising silently , in one motion . " Better take off your hat and coat , " Harold said . " It 's hot in here . " " Hot , " Joe Sam said . He took his hat off and put it on the wood in the box , and then slowly took his coat off , and folded it carefully , and laid it down beside the hat . He followed Harold to the table like a sleep-walker , and sat down in the chair beside Gwen , when Harold pulled it out for him . He did n't look around at anybody , but right across the table , over Grace 's shoulder , at the stairs . Harold sat down between him and the father . The father had finished already , and he was just sitting there now , hunched over his plate and breathing heavily . He was n't paying any attention to anyone else . Harold glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at Joe Sam . It made him a stranger to see him sitting there at the table , very upright , and blinking slowly against the light . Grace and Gwen kept looking at him secretly too , staring at the blue bandana and the hair that had come unbraided as if they had never seen them before . Finally Harold said , " You better eat something , Joe Sam . " The old Indian looked down at his plate , and after a moment , with all three of them watching him , picked up the two slices of beef that Gwen had put on it , and began to chew at them . After a couple of mouthfuls , he stopped chewing , and looked around at the others . He was smiling , and he lookedp194politely at each of them . " Good meat , " he said . They all looked away from him then , and he finished the meat and sat there emotionless and upright again , with his hands in his lap . For a long time nobody else said anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat . He did n't want to speak , but they had to know about it before the hammering began . " Mother wants the coffin down here tonight . She 's going to line it . " They both looked at him , but then they looked down at their plates again . Neither of them said anything . Harold knew they did n't understand what he meant , but after that he was n't going to say anything more . Even after they 'd finished eating , though , they all sat there staring into the shadow under the lamp . FinallyHarold roused himself and stood up . That motion , and the sound of his chair scraping on the floor , woke Grace and Gwen too . Gwen glanced at him quickly , but when she found him standing there watching her , she looked down again at once . Her face was awake and guarded now , but she sat as still as ever , and would n't look at him again . Well , he thought finally , if she thinks I 'm going to hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , he thought , looking at the father , I ca n't leave her with that on her hands again . Where 's he got to now ? he thought , seeing the blind eyes and the anger in the big red face , and the heavy lips moving . Somebody 's getting the best of him , anyway . " Dad , " he said . The old man did n't turn his head , and the look in his eyes did n't change , but he began to speak so they could hear him . ' The captain 's a fool , I tell you , " he said thickly . " Nineteen days now , and still nothing but the same goddam head wind and the snow and the goddam axes going chop , chop , chop . When you can hear anything but the wind , it 's just the goddam axes . And we 're frosted up like a wedding cake . Turn the ship around , you goddam fool , ' I told him , and he just yelped at me . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even talk like a man any more ; he barks like a dog . " He paused , wheezing like a man enraged beyond speech . " Drunk too , " he added . " Drunk all the time . "  |p195Clean  back to the Cape , Harold thought . He 's really getting away from it this time . But not out of trouble . " Dad , " he said again . The father drew himself up and turned his head slowly and stared at the big nickel buckle of Harold 's belt . " No , sir , " he began , " I tell you if we do n't give . . . " but then stopped , and tried to look up far enough to see who Harold was . " Do n't you want to go to bed now , Dad ? " After a moment the old man let his head swing back , and nodded . " Go to bed , " he said dully . " Never get any sleep around here . Always . . . " He let it go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ta go out first . " He peered around over the table . " Where 's my bottle ? " he asked . " Somebody took my bottle , " he muttered . " Damn , thievin ' , female tricks . If I . . . " but then stopped again , because he had found the bottle . He poured his glass half full , spilling some over onto the table this time . He drank the whisky off in two or three gulps , and carefully let the bottle down onto the floor again , and got to his feet very slowly , and breathing ferociously . He stood there for a moment , balancing himself on his fists on the table , and then swung around and started toward the door . He moved in wide lurches , and twice he had to stop , and peer around to discover where he was , and start over again . Harold moved over and followed close behind him , but the old man reached the door by himself and leaned against it . His breathing was like snoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the doorframe . Finally , holding onto the handle of the door with one hand , he rolled around with his back to the wall and raised the other . " Evenin ' everybody , " he said , " wonnerful evenin ' , " and swung around to the door again and got it open . The wind leapt in , nearly wrenching the door from him , and the snow sprayed in over him , making a fine , glittering mist in the light . He peered out into the darkness , and then looked back over his shoulder , more wakeful and completely astonished . " Snowing , " he told them . He peered out again . " Wha 's a lil snow ? " he asked , and let go and stepped down into the shallow drift outside the door . The door blew wide back , and the broken crest of the drift slitheredp196in across the floor . Harold caught the door , and went out , draggingit closed after him . The old man 's voice , thin and small iii the gale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o ' diamonds and trust to my luck , " and then was gone , as the deep roaring came down the mountain again . Without looking at Gwen , Grace said , " It 's the worst I 've ever seen him . " Gwen did n't answer , but Joe Sam made a small , soft sound in his throat . It might have been a chuckle , and it might not . ) When they looked at him , his face did n't tell them anything His good eyes was looking at them now , though , and seeing them . Gwen rose and began to clear the table . She moved quickly and sharply , putting the plates together too hard , and letting the knives and forks clatter on them . Grace got up slowly and began to help her . They were washing the dishes when Harold and the father came back in . The father had a new bottle of whisky . He leaned against the door and embraced the bottle while Harold brushed the snow off him . He was quiet now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He let Harold help him around the table and up the stairs without saying anything . Only as they were going in through the door from the landing , he said plaintively , " Curt should be back . No night to be out . Nobody be out . Harold came down again , and began to put on his coat and cap . " He 'll stay there this time , I think , " he said . He went over and took the lantern down and lit it . " Joe Sam , " he said . He had to speak three times , before Joe Sam looked at him and stood up , and then he had to help him into his coat and put his hat on him . They went out , letting the sound of the storm in , and a gust filled with snow , and then shutting them away again . Grace and Gwen finished the dishes in silence . Then Gwen went into the bunk-room , though she left the door open . Grace went slowly to the mother 's place at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there when the heavy knocking came at the bottom of the outside door . The knocking came a second time , even louder , before she slowly got up and walked across and opened the door.  |p197Harold  came in first , carrying the big end of the coffin , and with the lantern hanging from his belt . The coffin was black , with a new , thin coat of paint . It looked huge , coming into the small , white room , and a strong smell of tar came with it . Joe Sam stumbled up over the sill , carrying the narrow end , and blinking against the light . There was a fine powdering of blown snow clinging all over both the men , making them almost white , except for their faces , and a sifting of dry flakes stirred like sand on the lid of the coffin . Grace closed the door and stood against it , and watched Harold and Joe Sam carry the coffin slowly around the table and into the bedroom . Their feet made a soft shuffling because they were taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harold had to turn around and tilt the coffin a little to get it through . The figure on the bed was covered with a white blanket now , and there was a folded quilt on the floor by the table . The mother stood up and pushed the rocking chair back to make room by the bed . " Set it over here , " she said , " where I 'll have the light to see by . " They set the coffin down beside the bed , being very careful not to make a loud sound . Then Harold took the lantern off his belt and set it down by the coffin . He lifted the lid off the coffin , and a strong smell of wet sage came out of it , stronger even than the tar smell . He carried the lid over and stood it on end beside the wardrobe . The nails were already standing up all around the edge of it , ready to be driven in . He came hack and took a hammer and a box of tacks out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took out the two , big , twisted pieces of wet sage and stood there holding them , one in each hand . " He liked the smell of it when it was wet like that , " he said . The mother nodded . " You could leave it on the bed , " she said . He laid the two gray branches on the bed , one on each side of the feet under the white blanket . The mother looked down into the coffin . The inside was still white , raw wood , and there were sage leaves scattered all over the bottom . " I thought maybe I 'd put balsam in the lining , " she said . Harold nodded.  |p198The  mother looked at Joe Sam , who was standing at the foot of the bed , looking at the long shape under the blanket . His face did n't show anything . " That 's all for now , I guess , " the mother said . " Well , " Harold said , " if you want me for anything , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him , but she did n't say anything , just nodded . Harold picked up the lantern , and said , " Come on , Joe Sam , " and went back out into the kitchen . The old Indian followed him silently . Harold hesitated for a moment between the stove and the table . He looked at the open doorway of the bunk-room , and then back into the white bedroom . The mother was already bending over the coffin , unfolding the quilt along the edge of it . It was a patchwork quilt , with patches of all shapes and colors on it . Some of the patches shone in the light like water , and changed color when the mother moved the quilt . Grace was still standing by the outside door . " I 'll leave the lantern , " Harold told her . He blew the lantern out and set it on the table . " If she needs me for anything , you come up and call me , will you ? " " All right , " Grace said . Harold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it stayed empty , with only the soft light showing in it from the lamp that was out of sight . " And you might tell Gwen good night for me . " Grace came away from the door and stood beside the table . " You better tell her yourself , " she said . " I do n't guess so . You tell her for me . " " All right , " Grace said . " I 'll tell her . " " And you get some sleep too . " " Oh , I will . " He tried to grin at her , and patted her arm , and said , " Come on , Joe Sam . " They went out , and Harold pulled the door closed , getting a last look at Grace , still standing there against the table , looking at nothing . Then there was only a square shaft of light coming out of the window beside them . The light spread quickly against the driven snow , and did n't reach far . Whenp199they had crossed it , the darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they came around the corner of the house , the wind shut them off too . " Keep close behind me , Joe Sam , " Harold yelled , and then looked ahead again and up the slope , trying to keep the bunkhousewindow in sight . Sometimes it would show brightly for an instant , but most of the time it was dim and small behind the twisting veils of the blizzard , and sometimes it almost winked out . Twice he felt Joe Sam touch him on the small of the back , to make sure where he was . Harold woke gently into a deep hush in the morning . For some reason he could not remember , he felt lazy and profoundlyat peace , almost happy . After a minute , he turned his head on the pillow and looked at the window . There was a little wall of snow at the bottom of each pane , and beyond them he could see huge , far-separated flakes floating down through a brightening air . It must be pretty well snowed out , he thought , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he rememberedeverything else that had happened too . The wall of peace that sleep , and perhaps good dreams , had raised in his mind , crumbled away . It seemed to him then that lie must have slept too long , and that something had happened while he slept , something he might have prevented if he 'd been awake . He threw back his blankets and started to roll up onto the edge of his bunk . Then he saw Joe Sam , and froze where he was , propped up on one elbow . The old Indian was crouched on one knee , so close to the head of the bunk that Harold could have reached out and touched his face . He was naked again , and holding the bottle neck down against his hip , like a knife ready to be driven forward and up . He was whispering rapidly and softly , like anp200excited breathing , and making little , quieting motions with his left hand , as if to keep someone else still . Harold glanced quickly past the old man to see who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a little sawdust and a few shavings on it , that he had missed when he swept up after his work . Harold looked back at the bottle neck again , to be ready to jump when it started . It did n't move , though , except to tremble a little where it was . I ca n't stay here all day like this , Harold thought , and turned his head very slowly to look at Joe Sam 's face . Joe Sam was n't watching him at all ; he was watching something down at the foot of the bunk . He was turned a little toward the foot of the bunk , and was holding himself ready to leap at it . Harold looked quickly clown where the old man was looking , but there was nothing there either , except the shape of his own legs and feet under the covers . He did n't dare to move his feet , for fear Joe Sam would pounce on them like a cat . He was watching them like a cat watching a hole where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Harold thought , the cat . He 's holding the cat back , lbut he 's ready to help it , too . They 're together . The image was distinct for a moment , but then it passed , and he was n't so sure . pr maybe he 's helping Curt , he thought . Maybe it 's the cat he ' ' has cornered . What 's the good of making fool guesses ? he asked himself more wakefully . The old man 's seeing things again , That 's all that 's sure . " Joe Sam , " he said quietly . The excited whispering stopped at once , but Joe Sam still crouched there , with one hand out to hold back his invisible ally . He appeared to be holding his breath now , in order to hear better . " Joe Sam , " Harold said again , and more loudly . Moving only his eyes , the old Indian looked up Harold 's length from the feet he had been watching so intently . When he saw Harold 's eyes looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then , gradually , the excited pleasure faded from his face . His lips , which had been drawn back in a half grin , closed over the worn stumps of his teeth , and he let the bottle neck down to the floor . Then , before Harold could speak again , he stood up and padded softly across the room and let the bottlep201neck down into the trash keg without a sound . More slowly , all the purpose gone out of him , he drifted back to the stove and stood beside it , holding his hands out to the cold iron . The snow light from the window revealed all the bony knots of his dark body . He began to shake heavily . He hunched and tightenedhimself against the shaking , but that only made it worse . Same as it was in the corral yesterday , Harold thought . Ile comes out of it , and he 's a hundred years old again . He swung up onto the edge of the bunk , and felt much better because he had completed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . The old Indian looked back over his shoulder . His face was sad , and his jaw was shaking like the rest of him . " Hello , " he said . Like it was any morning , Harold thought , and asked , " What were you after with that bottle neck ? " " No got bottle neck , " the old man said finally . Harold watched him intently , but he said nothing more , and finally he looked back at the stove . Harold shrugged his shoulders and stood up . " You better get into your bunk . The fire 's out . " The old man slowly drew his hands away from the stove and held his elbows with them , hugging himself . Still hugging himself , he moved slowly across to his bunk , but then just stood there beside it , staring down at it . " Get in , Joe Sam . Get under the blankets , " Harold said . Still the old man just stood there , staring , until Harold began to feel uneasily that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something left over from the excited dream . Then , instead of getting into the bunk , he took up the red flannel underwear that lay on top of his other clothes and began to get into it very slowly . He was shaking so badly that he had trouble balancing himself when he had to stand on one leg . He does n't know it , though , Harold thought , watching him . It like he woke up into a dream , not the other way round . " You better get under the covers and warm up first , " he said . " Whisky , " Joe Sam said . " Make warm . " He went on trying to get into the red underwear . " All right . I 'll get you a drink when I go down . But you better stay in bed a while first . You got the shakes bad . "  | " Feed chickens , " Joe Sam said . He got into the underwear finally , and buttoned it and reached for his shirt . Harold stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sleepy defiance . But then he thought , letting the anger pass , Better keep him where I can watch him , at that , and looked down at the boot he was holding , and began to pull it on . But no more bottle necks , he thought . We 're done with bottle necks . He slowed his dressing to let Joe Sam finish first . When the old man was dressed , he said , " You go on down , Joe Sam . I 'll he along in a minute . " He stood up and crossed to the wash basin and poured it full of water . The film of ice that had formed in the night clicked faintly as it broke into the basin . Harold watched Joe Sam in the piece of mirror on the wall . It was more real , some way , than looking right at him , to see the small figure standing out so distinctly in the middle of the room in the white , snow light , and behind him , much farther behind him than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long hall , the bare board wall of the other end and the pile of stove wood , with a bridle hangingfrom a nail above it . It was Joe Sam 's dress-up bridle , and the silver studding on it made tiny points of shining . The points of shining were n't attached to the bridle . They were alive in the air by themselves . The little , dark man in the center of the hall just stood there , looking at Harold 's back . He was too small for his face to show clearly . Only his eye on the side toward the window shone by itself , like one of the silver nails . Harold wanted to turn around and look at the face that was too small to show anything in the glass . He did n't , though , but doused his face quickly with the cold water , wetting his hair too , and looked into the long hall in the mirror again . The little , dark figure was still there , but water had splashed onto the mirror , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly Harold was really ! afraid of the figure . It became the same dangerous stranger whohad come to life before , when there were no tracks in the snow . I hadgo along , Joe Sam , " he said sharply , and then , ashamed of the edge in his voice , added , " You 're cold enough now . Get down there and get yourself warm . I 'll be down directly . "  |p203He  doused his face again , and cleared his eyes , and saw the little figure in the long hall turn toward the door , appearing between water streaks and vanishing behind them . Then the door opened , making a white rectangle in the dark hall . The figure appeared in the white rectangle , and vanished from it as it had behind the water on the glass . The faraway door remainedopen , showing only a faintly moving whiteness , like breath on the glass . It occurred to Harold that the figure had n't gone through the white rectangle at all , but only across it , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall toward the trash keg . In spite of himself , he turned around quickly . The long hall with the shadows he could n't see into became the small , ordinary room , with plenty of light to show everything in it , and there was nobody else in the room . He relaxed slowly . Finally he even grinned at himself a little . " It 's me I better keep the eye on , not Joe Sam , " he said . He looked through the open door and down the hill . Only the snow-covered plane of the house roof showed , and the dark , log tower at the north end of it , with its cap of thick white . They were small and faint through the falling snow . Joe Sam was n't in sight . Harold quickly finished washing , wiped his face and hands and combed his hair . Then he emptied the basin into the slop pail , and straightened up and looked at the door again , and then at the window . There was still only the faraway roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box under the sawhorses and took out a hammer and went to the trash keg . Ile lifted out the jagged bottle neck and laid it on the floor and smashed it into small pieces with the hammer . He swept up the pieces and dumped them into the keg . Then he dropped the hammer hack into the tool box , put on his cap and mackinaw , and went out . He was just closing the door when he saw Joe Sam . He stiffenedand held his breath , because the old man was standing flat against the outside wall , so close to the door that their shoulders were nearly touching . Then he let out his breath and loosened his shoulders . Joe Sam was n't even looking at him . I le was just standing there , hugging himself and staring down dreamily at the house from under the brim of the black sombrero.  |p204After  a moment , Harold said , " Come on , Joe Sam , " carefully keeping the anger out of his voice , and pulled the door to , and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hips now , and he had to drag his way down through it . It made a quilted hush over everything , that could be felt in the body , especially after the loud noise he 'd made with the hammer in the hollow bunkhouse . He looked back once , and Joe Sam was coming down right behind him , stepping carefully in his tracks in the bottom of the trench his legs were plowing . Harold smiled in his mind , and thought , He hates to leave a track . Then he thought , looking at Joe Sam 's face , He could n't help hearing me break that thing , but if he cares , he 's sure keeping it to himself . He looked out toward the valley , but in this heavy snowing , it was n't even the beginning of a plain any longer . The white world was closed in to its smallest yet . Gwen was alone in the kitchen when they came in . She was already dressed , wearing the bright , yellow blouse again , but her hair was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mane down her back , drawn together at the nape of her neck and tied with a yellow ribbon . Harold had never seen her with her hair down before . It was just one more little difference , but suddenly everything in the familiar kitchen was strange , the way the bunk-house had been in the mirror . Gwen half turned around from what she was doing at the stove , and looked at him . With her hair drawn back tight that way she appeared older too . She looked very tired , and her eyes were only seeing him , not saying anything or asking anything . " Good morning , " she said , and turned back . " I 'll have your breakfast ready in a few minutes , " she said . So it 's still that way , Harold thought , and after a moment said , " I brought Joe Sam down too . " " I see you did , " she said , turning something in the pan . " Grace up ? " " Not yet . She did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either , huh ? " " Do n't bother yourself about me . " Do n't think I am , he thought , with sudden anger , but waited , and finally said , " I do , though . You know that . " " Thanks , " she said.  |p205He  waited again , and then said softly , " All right . Have it your own way . " Gwen did n't say anything . So he was still in a strange place when he went around the table and into the north room . The lamp in the window was out , but everything in the white room was clear with light from the snow . The shape on the bed was still covered with the white blanket , and the smell of sage and balsam was almost strong enough to cover the other smell . The coffin was still standing where they 'd set it , by the bed , but the lining was all tacked into it now . It looked queer , that soft , puffy patchwork of bright colors inside the plain wooden box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harold looked over at the lid , leaning against the wall , and saw that there was a piece of quilt tacked onto it too . The mother was sitting in the rocking chair beside the coffin , and Harold thought at first that she was asleep , but when he did n't speak , she opened her eyes and looked up at him . " Ai n't this snow ever gon na stop ? " she asked , hardly moving her lips . She was n't really asking a question , but just protesting faintly . " It ca n't last much longer at this rate , " Harold said . The mother closed her eyes again . " We 'll have the buryin ' as quick as it stops , " she said . " I 'd like we should have a preacher for it , " she added . " Not much chance of that , I guess , " Harold said . " No , " she agreed , and after a moment said , " Your pa should do the talkin ' , by rights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No , " Harold said . " Well , " the mother said finally , " we 'll wrap him in that blue spread , I guess . He 's always been partial to that blue spread . When he was a little feller , he was always after me to get out the blue spread so he could look at it . He 'd sit there and study over it an hour at a time . Run his finger around on all the birds and trees and things like he was drawin ' them hisself . Tell hisselfstories about ' em while he was doin ' it . They was more real to him than people that come to the house . He was a queer little feller . Had a world all his own , could n't anybody else get into , half the time . "  | " I know , " Harold said , and thought , Not only when he was a kid , either . " We 'll clear the grave off as soon as the snow lets up , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if the snow do n't stop , " the mother said . " I know , but it 's going to . Has to , the way it 's snowin ' now , and no wind . " The mother opened her eyes again , and looked at the coffin . " We could put him in now , " she said . " While we 're alone . " " All right , " Harold said , and without knowing it rubbed his hands hard and slowly down his thighs . " You better let me get Joe Sam , though . Why do n't you go in the kitchen and get yourselfsome coffee ? Joe Sam and I 'll take care of it . " " I do n't know , " the mother said wearily . " I do n't like too much he should do it , a last Christian duty like that . " After a moment Harold said , " Arthur thought a lot of him . " " I know that . More than he did of the rest of us , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Mother . " She sat so long , motionless and with her eyes closed , that he began to wonder if she 'd fallen asleep , but finally she asked , " Is that Gwen Williams getting breakfast ? " " Yes , it is . " Again the mother waited some time before she spoke . " I 'll just go in your room and lie down a while , I guess . You could bring me some coffee when it 's ready . " And she 's still at it too , Harold thought wearily . " All right , " he said . The mother opened her eyes and sat up . After a moment she took firm hold upon the arms of the chair and pushed herself to her feet . She faltered when she let go of the chair , though , and Harold quickly put a hand to her arm-pit to steady her . When she was sure on her feet , she stiffened against his hold . " I can do for myself , thanks . " Harold let go of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white blanket for a minute , and then turned and walked slowly into the kitchen . She went across the kitchen the same way , without looking around , and into the bunk-room , and closed the door again behind her . Harold followed her intop207the kitchen , and stopped by the table . Gwen was standing at the stove , where the mother had almost brushed her going by . She was holding the long fork in her hand , and looking at the bunkroomdoor . " She 's going to lie down for a while , " Harold said . Gwen looked down at the fork , and said , " Your breakfast 's all ready . " " Could you keep it a couple of minutes ? " " Whenever you 're ready , " Gwen said . " Joe Sam , " Harold said . The old Indian stood up in his place by the wood-box and started toward the outside door . He still had his coat and hat on . " Could you give me a hand in here ? " Harold said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in after him , and stood at the foot of the bed , where he had stood the night before . " We have to put him in the coffin , Joe Sam . " " Put Arthur in ? " He does n't like it , Harold thought . Does n't want to touch it , or maybe it 's the coffin that bothers him . Wants it done some other way , maybe . Right into the ground . Or even one of those crow's-nest burials . He studied the old face , but could n't guess anything from it . " That 's the way Mother wants it . " " Not like , " Joe Sam said . " Maybe not , but that 's the way we 'll ( 10 it . " " Arthur not like , " Joe Sam said . What the hell does it matter , coffin or crow-bait ? Harold thought , staring at him . It 's not Arthur anyway , this bloated old man with a profit-counting face . When he did n't answer , Joe Sam looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , the way it did when Curt bullied him . " Woman say so , I not care , " he said . The hell you do n't , Harold thought . He lifted the two branches of sage off the white blanket and laid them on the floor . He stood beside the bed for a moment then , holding his hands against his thighs again , but finally set his mouth straight and tight , and moving quicker and harder than the task needed ,  |p208drew  back the white blanket and let it fall over the foot of the bed . He held his eyes from looking at the face , and he was holding his breath too . Joe Sam , though , was looking down the length of the body at the face . He was seeing it , and he had thoughts about it . " We 'll wrap him in the blue spread , " Harold said . " He liked the blue spread . He liked the pictures on it . Even when he was a kid he used to look at them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke rapidly , almost chattering , while he kept his eyes nearly blind and made his hands quickly lift the head and draw the pillow from under it . He dropped the pillow on the floor and then lifted that side of the blue spread and laid it over the body as far as it would go . Then the face was covered again too . " Good blanket , " Joe Sam said . He touched the blue spread with his fingertips , where it was turned over the feet . Then he moved around to the other side of the bed , before Harold could , and lifted the other half of the spread and folded it over too . Harold waited at the foot of the bed , a little ashamed that the old man should be finishing the task for him , but relieved too . He watched the dark , gnarled hands fold the spread into itself all the way down , and then turn the corners in again over the feet and at the throat , so it would hold . Like he was alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sick man . And gentle as a woman at it . It suits him better than the coffin . He woke himself from the thoughts , and looked across at Joe Sam . The old Indian was just standing there beside the bed , waiting for what came next . Harold went around beside the coffin again , and pushed back the rocking chair , and picked up the pillow . He laid the pillow in the big end of the coffin and smoothed it and straightened up again . Then he made a little motion toward the feet of the blue-wrapped shape . When Joe Sam had moved down there and slid his hands under the feet , Harold made his mind blank and set himself to endure the touch and the stiff weight . He pulled the body over at an angle . so he could get hold under both shoulders , and then the two of them lifted it . It was n't as bad as he 'd made himself ready for . The body sagged a little , but not enough to make trouble , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . He breathed hardp209and slowly , and was afraid the head would roll off the arm he had under it , but actually they lifted the body evenly between them and let it down slowly into the coffin , until it settled into the quilt and the pillow , and nothing went wrong . Harold straightened up at the head of the coffin , and stood there steadying his breath and wiping his hands slow and hard on his jeans again . Joe Sam waited at the foot of the coffin . Both of them were still looking at the long , narrow mummy the blue spread made . Harold 's mind took hold again , and he thought , No damn line-up , like a church . No going around it , staring in . There 's no knowing what she 'd think of to do . If we put the lid on now , she ca n't . He leaned over and picked up the two branches of sage and pushed them down into the coffin beside the legs . Then he went around the coffin and Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and came back with it . But then he had to stand there and hold it , because Joe Sam was kneeling beside the coffin , leaning over it so the hair of his loose braid hung inside . He was reaching in by the head with one hand . When he took the hand away , Harold saw that he 'd left a little , buckskin pouch between the bulges made by the chin and the crossed hands . There was a pattern of black and white porcupine quills around the pouch , a line of little wedges , like birds flying in a row . His medicine pouch , Harold thought . He looked at the shape of what was in the pouch , and thought , One of the black paintersArthur made him . Joe Sam took something out of his coat pocket and reached into the coffin again . He did this three times . Then there was a red tobacco tin lying on one side of the head , and on the other side there were five arrowheads in a line , like the flying quills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quartz and one was a dull , hard red , like dried blood . The other three were shiny black obsidian . There was a thin band of yellow buckskin stretched across the forehead of the shrouded figure too . It had a quill pattern on it , like the one on the pouch , and a row of small , iridescent , green and black feathers sewed along one edge of it . Two little rawhide tie-thongs , with beads on them , hung clown from each end of the band . I wonder how he makes a warrior out of Arthur ? Haroldp210thought , and then , But maybe the feathers can mean something else too . And then , looking at the feathers , he knew where they came from . They were from the neck and shoulders of the bantamcock . Joe Sam was standing up , waiting for him to put the top on . " That 's fine , Joe Sam . He 'll like that , " Harold said . The old man looked at him , showing nothing in his face , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . Get it over with , he thought . Anything anybody could say would be bad , and laid the lid down carefully , and set it so the nail points were in the holes they 'd started . Only then , when he stood up and looked down , and there was only the black , flatsidedshape of the coffin , did he feel how final the act was . The loss and the love came together strongly in him , making a real prayer , although he did n't bother with any words , only Arthur 's name repeating itself in his mind . He looked up , and Joe Sam was holding out the hammer to him . He took it . Then he thought of Grace and the father still sleeping , and said , " Close the door , will you , Joe Sam ? " The old man went over and closed the door softly , and stayed there against it . Even then the pounding seemed to make a terribledin in the small , white room . Harold screwed up his face against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needing extra blows . After that he did better , driving each nail in with just two blows , but even so , when he had driven in the last nail , and stood up again , he felt the hammering still going on in his head . There was a fine sweat on his forehead , and his hands were shaking a little . He laid the hammer carefully on the table , not making a sound with it , and then , more to steady himselfthan for any other reason , straightened the bed , moulding it with his hands to take the long shape of the body out of it , folded the white blanket and draped it over the footboard , and opened the north window a crack . The cold , clean air sucked in , breaking the powdery top layer off the snow that had piled up on the sill and blowing it over the table . Then he turned back . Joe Sam opened the door , and he went out into the kitchen . Joe Sam followed him , and pulled the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a mug of coffee . She had on a blue flannel dressing gown , pulled close aroundp211her throat , as if she were cold , and her hair was hanging loose down her back and in front of her shoulders . Gray hairs showed in it that were hidden when it was done up . Her face was very white , with great dark hollows under the eyes . She let the cup down , and Harold saw that her hand was shaking . " That hammering , " she said , and her mouth trembled too . " I 'm sorry , " Harold said . " It is n't just now , " Grace said . " She was hammering in there all night . She 'd hammer , and you could hear it echoing all over , as if there was n't anything in the house . " " Everything 's ready , " Gwen said , setting the first two plates on the table . " You 'd better eat something too , Grace . " " No , I could n't , " Grace said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked Harold . Gwen put two more plates onto the table , and began to pour coffee into the mugs . " I guess so , " Harold said . " If this snow 'll let up . " Grace sat down at the table and went on sipping her coffee , not looking at anybody , but only into the center of the table , where the light from the window made a faint shining . Joe Sam sat down in his place without anybody speaking to him . He watched Gwen and Harold sit down , and glance at each other , and then quickly down at their plates . He kept on watching them from under the brim of the black sombrero , and again his presence grew until they could not speak or move ; easily before him . He seemed to fill the room , and to be the only ( real thing in it . All morning . while the falling snow thinned out and the air grew colder and brighter around them , Harold and Joe Sam shoveled paths and did the chores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and off the stacks for the cattle , and feeding the hogs and the chickens . Joe Sam worked slowly and dreamily ,  |p212and  often Harold , looking back in the trench they were cutting through the drifts , would see him just standing there , leaning on his shovel and staring out over the piled snow at the mountainor across the valley . He 'd have to speak to him two or three times to wake him . Only while they were clearing the chicken run , and the space behind the bunk-house to feed the birds on , did he work steadily . He scattered the grain on both clearings too , but even the ritual of feeding the chickens was n't quite the same as usual . His face remained expressionless and his vision turned inward even at the very end , while he held the grain down in his hands for the bantams to pick at . Harold stopped work for a few minutes to watch him , though , and was cheered a little because the vain bantam cock was still there with his henHe must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thought . There were fifteen or twenty of them on that bonnet , anyway . When the chores were done , they dug a path up the hill behind the house to the woodpile , and then on up to the open grave under the pines . The wind was beginning to move on the mountain by then , and they were showered repeatedly by long , glittering veils falling away from the boughs above them . When Harold stopped to rest , and looked out over the house at the valley , he could see faint shadows racing across the open under the surface-scud , and even the solid , white shapes of the hills on the other side beginning to show here and there . By the time Gwen came out to the corner of the house and called up to them that lunch was ready , a great , formless shifting of halfaightand faint shadow was going on everywhere beyond her. arold was almost ashamed , when he thought of what they were doing now , and of Curt out there somewhere in the white sea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into everything when he heard her voice calling his name , and looked , and saw her down there . The sound of that life was in his voice answering her , too , but before it was quiet , even , she had disappeared behind the house again , without replying . The world darkened and emptied again , and he set his jaw , thinking , Am I to blame for my whole damn family too ? But he could n't keep up the temper while he was swinging the shovel , and afterp213it came the familiar despair , and he thought , Well , are n't I , as far as she 's concerned ? He and Joe Sam finished clearing the grave , and a path around it , and stood their snow shovels up in the mound on the north side of the grave , with the shovels that had dug the earth , and went down to the house . Gwen was still quiet and apart , and Joe Sam did n't eat , or even drink his coffee this time , but only sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat and the blue bandana on . There were only the three of them in the kitchen , and nobody spoke . Harold and Gwen tried to eat , but mostly they poked at their food or just sat studying their plates . It was only when Harold stood up that Gwen finally broke the silence . " Your mother said to tell you it would n't be till later , not till about sundown . " " Changed her mind again ? " " I do n't know . She just told me to tell you . " " She 's still hoping Curt will get back , " Harold said finally . " Maybe . She did n't say . " Harold felt the little anger against her rise in him once more . He waited until it sank back , and said , " I 'll take the drag down on the meadows , then . The stock 's coming in from everywhere now . Ca n't get anything through the snow . If you need me for something , just come down by the stacks and wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Even before he finished speaking , he was ashamed that he was saying so much , making it a kind of begging for her attention . " We 're getting along all right , " Gwen said . " Well , when she 's ready , if I 'm not back by then . " " I 'm not helpless , " Gwen said . " I 'll come for you if you 're wanted . " Harold stared at her , thinking , To hell with you too , then , but she would n't look at him , after the angry glance that went with what she said . Harold waited until the red dancing was out of his own eyes , and he could speak to Joe Sam quietly . Then he held the door and went out after the old Indian , and closed the door again , without once looking back . All afternoon , though , while he walked beside the drag , orp214stood on its shallow deck astride the ston that were piled there , he kept looking back at the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sitting down , with his arms spread along the tail-board , like a man riding in a rowboat , and every time Harold looked , he looked too , but there was nothing to see that was n't there all the time . The wind grew steadily colder and stronger , until Harold had to make Joe Sam get out and walk behind , on the bent grass of the wake , and beat his arms across his chest to warm himself . The snow mist broke open over them , and islands of light began to glide across the meadows to the southeast , and then the islands of light became islands of shadow that fled over the white expanse and diagonally up the eastern hills , to vanish in the blue , and still nothing moved up by the stacks except the cattle that were feeding there . The drag moved on steadily through the light snow , and the wind whipped the curling snow away from the prow like spray . A long line of cattle , far behind and moving slowly , followed in the wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north there were more of them coming in , singly and by twos and threes , only black dots on the dazzle of the drifted range . At last the drag was so far out that the stacks and the sheds and the house were only tiny toys , already in shadow at the foot of the home mountain . The whole length of the lower range showed from there , stippled black with timber the wind had cleaned , and the main range loomed above it like a white wall , with the last dark clouds rising thinly out of it here and there . It was Joe Sam who saw Gwen when she did come out . The wind had died down again , by then , and the white breath of the men and the big horses , laboring with arched necks , floated in slow white plumes in the frosty air . " Woman say come , " Joe Sam announced from the back of the drag , and Harold peered far across into the shadow over the ranch , and could just make out the tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised his arm and waved it , to show that he saw her , and turned the drag back in a wide curve . She stood there for a long time , watching while they moved in until the big range sank slowly out of sight behind the timbered one , and then until they had come into the reaching shadow themselves . Harold began to hope that there would be a difference now ,  |p215but  then , when the drag was moving upslope through the feedingherd , he saw her turn and go back without a sign or a sound . He hardened himself inside again , and his face was as expressionlessas Joe Sam 's while they were putting the drag away , and letting the team back into the corral , and forking out the hay for them . When they came into the house , the mother was sitting in the big chair , reading in a pocket Testament with a black leather cover . She was holding it close to her face , with her big fingers far up the back of it . The black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair behind her . Gwen was sitting sidewaysin one of the chairs by the table , with her hands in her lap , just waiting . She had on the dark skirt still , but a new blouse , a white one with puffy shoulders and a lace front and a narrow , black ribbon at the throat . Her hair was done up in the heavy braid again . The room was full of just waiting , and yet of not wanting the waiting to be done , either . The mother was reading with her fingers and her lips now . She finished the passage she was reading and lowered the Testamentinto her lap and closed it . " It 's pretty near dark already , " she said . " I 'll change as quick as I can , " Harold told her . " Never mind any changing now , " she said . " I do n't reckon there 's anybody to care what you have on . " " I 'll get Grace up , " Gwen said , and rose , and took Grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunk-room . " You might light the lamp for us to come back by , " the mother said , " and then go up and see is your pa fit to come with us . " Harold pulled the lamp down and lit it , and let it up again , and the little moths stirred on the white walls . Then he went up the stairs onto the landing and opened the door and looked in . The reflected light from the hills came in the east window and showed the father sprawled on the bed with the top quilt pulled half over him . A bottle with the cork out of it lay on its side under the edge of the bed . The old man 's hand was hanging limp over the edge , as if it had stayed just where it had let go of the bottle . He was snoring slowly and heavily . Every time , Harold thought . He gets out of it every time ,  |p216and  closed the door and came back down the stairs . The mother was standing by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her hands folded together and holding the little Testamentagainst her , like a priest 's hands holding his breviary . She looked at Harold , asking the question , and he shook his head . Her mouth grew wide and thin , and curved down , but she did n't say anything . Harold said , " Come on , Joe Sam , " and started toward the north bedroom , but then he thought suddenly , We ca n't let it down into the grave , and was frightened at how close he had come to forgetting that . It would be terrible to have them all standing around the grave there , waiting , and then not have any way to let the coffin down . We have to have ropes , he thought , two ropes , one for each end . The words came off the top of his mind . He was acting because of words that came off the top of his mind . The lariats , he thought . They 'll do , and went over into the wood-box corner . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he took two of them down . Gwen and Grace came out of the bunk-room . Gwen was wearing her cloak , with the hood already up , and she had her arm around Grace . Grace was walking in a daze , with her head down , not really over on Gwen 's shoulder , but just turned and bending toward it . One look at Grace made it all worse for Harold , so he could feel the same weakness taking all the stuff out of his own knees . It was funny how , just when you were getting used to it one way , you had to do something about it , like this , and it all got worse again . You had to tip it part way to get it in , the words from the top of his mind said , so you 'll have to tip it again to get it out . Only he 's in it now . You do n't want them in here watching it tip that way with him in it . He laid the ropes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait , Mother , " he said . The mother nodded and said , " Come along , Grace . We 'll wait outside , " and opened the door and went out . Gwen and Grace went slowly across after her . When they were in the door , Harold said , " Just leave it open , will you ? " Gwen nodded so he could see the wrinkles in her hood move ,  |p217and  took Grace out onto the snow . Grace went as if she could n't have done it by herself , and maybe did n't even know for sure where she was going . Then Harold could see the three darkskirtedfigures two together , and the third and tallest one apart , waiting out there on the snow , with the steep wall of the mountainsnow behind them , with the black pines on it . He went into the bedroom . Joe Sam followed him , and went to the small end of the coffin without being told , when Harold went to the big end . " All right , " Harold said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side and then the left side , to get their fingers under it , and then all of it together and held level . Harold could feel the weight shift a little inside , but not sliding , like something rolling heavily on an axle . " We 'll turn it around in here , " he said . " There is n't room in the kitchen . " They turned it around slowly , and Harold backed to the door , and then they had to do the tilting . The weight shifted inside again , this time falling clear down against the side of the coffin , and the top of Harold 's mind said to him , You should have made it so he could n't slide in it . It would have gone through the door straight then , too . You would n't have had to tip it at all . Then the big end was through , and they leveled the coffin between them again , and the weight slowly shifted back . After that it was better . Harold backed between the stove and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffin was headed for the door . Then the top of his mind said , You ca n't back all the way up there , and added sharply , because he had nearly forgottenagain , And you 've left the ropes on the table . " Let 's put it down here a minute , Joe Sam , " he said , " and get a fresh hold on it . " They set it down very carefully , so that it scarcely made a sound on the floor . Harold took the ropes from the table , and stood there a minute , holding them and thinking . " You take one over your shoulder , " he said , " and I 'll take the other . Then we wo n't drop them on the way up . " Ile hung one coil over Joe Sam 's shoulder , with his arm through it . He slipped the other on himself the same way , but then felt how it would slide down when he had to lean over , and said , " No , better put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own.  |p218He  thought he 'd have to change Joe Sam 's for him too , but the old Indian did it for himself . Then the coils of the rope hung down on his chest like a huge necklace with several strands . After a moment Joe Sam slid it up so the strands were tight against his throat and the coils hung down on his back . He 's doing better than you are , at that , the voice said to Harold , and he pushed his own rope up to hang on his back too . They stood still at opposite ends of the coffin , their shadows big on the white walls among the shadow moths . Then Harold said , " You ready ? " Joe Sam nodded . Harold turned his back to the big end , and saw the mother standing in the door watching them , trying to hurry them without saying anything . " We 'll try and go all the way in one lift , " he told Joe Sam , " but if you feel it slipping , you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let it fall , that 's all . If you feel it slipping , say so , quick . " Joe Sam made a soft sound to show he heard . Harold squatted and got his hands under the big end , first one side and then the other , and lifted slowly . When he felt the other end rising too , he stood up . " I 'll go ahead , " the mother said , and Harold nodded as he advanced toward the door . " You and Gwen can follow them , Grace , " the mother said , and had the little procession arranged the way it was in her mind . Gwen said , " All right , Mrs. Bridges , " and when Harold came out past her , said softly , " You go on , Harold . I 'll get the door . " There was more light left outside than he 'd expected , after being in the kitchen with the lamp on . There were still faint , golden edges on the clouds that were getting smaller above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the tops of the eastern hills , too . It reflected back , and colored the snow around them softly , and even seemed to rise up out of the snow and make a glowing in the still air . The mother led the way around the corner of the house and up the slope , walking very straight in the deep , narrow path between the snow banks , but still holding the Testament against her in folded hands , and taking her steps slowly , so they would n't get too far behind her with the coffin . Harold had top219kick into the snow each step he took on the hill , to be sure he did n't slip back . Once , when they were half-way up the slope , he heard a long , weak , whimpering sound behind him , and then Gwen 's voice , murmuring too low for him to hear the words . He looked quickly at where his next step would go , and then glanced back over his shoulder . Grace and Gwen were standing still , back around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way in Gwen 's shoulder now . Gwen was holding her with both arms and talking softly with her mouth right against the turned-up collar of Grace 's coat . Seeing them like that , with the sound of the whimper still alive in him , Harold felt his knees go slack , and his fingers under the edge of the coffin getting too weak to hold . " We better put it down a minute , " he said . The turn by the woodpile was nearly level , and the snow was shoveled off it . They set the coffin down there , and Harold straightened up and breathed deeply and looked at the mountainand the dark cloud with a pale fringe of light that was looking over it . Gradually the trembling in his knees stopped and his hands felt stronger . Joe Sam just waited for him , not moving at all , or even breathing hard . The mother went on up the path nearly to the grave before she knew they were n't followingher . Then she turned and waited up there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climb again . They moved in step and close together , with Gwen 's arm still around Grace , but Grace was holding her head up now , and trying to step firmly . " All right ? " Harold asked . The little , private joke was in Joe Sam 's eye , but he only nodded and did n't say anything . They took up the coffin again , carefully , and started slowly up the last slope . The mother turned and moved ahead again , and onto the level space beside the grave . When they got up there , she was already standing at the head of the narrow pit , with her back to the mountain . They set the coffin down again on the north edge . " You better put it in now , " the mother said . Harold glanced down and saw Gwen and Grace slowly makingthe turn by the woodpile , and nodded . He lifted his rope off over his head and uncoiled it . He looked across the coffin ,  |p220but  Joe Sam was already uncoiling his rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the coffin , but then had to wait while Gwen and Grace passed slowly behind Joe Sam , and around onto the south edge . When they were standing there , like one double figure , with Grace hiding her face in Gwen 's shoulder again , Harold looked at Joe Sam and nodded . They lifted the coffin a little off the snow and shuffled sidewards with it cradled between them in the ropes . The mother moved back to let Harold in front of her . When they were standing spreadlegged , one at each end of the grave , Harold nodded again . Breathing hard , more from carefulness than from the weight , they leaned over as far as they dared , and then began to let the ropes slip through their hands very slowly . Even so the coffin grated once against a stone in the side of the grave , and then a second time . The second time it swung a little too , and struck gently as it swung back , making a soft , woody , hollow sound . Grace put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shield it from a blow , and burrowed a little into Gwen 's shoulder , making the whimpering sound again . The coffin settled onto the bottom with only a faint , sandy grating , and Harold and Joe Sam began to work their ropes out from under it . When they were free , first Harold , and then Joe Sam after him , coiled his rope and fastened it with the twist around it again . Harold took Joe Sam 's rope too , and laid both of them down at the end of the piled earth . Then he came back and stood by himself in the middle of the north side . The mother moved down close to the head of the grave again , and looked across at Gwen and Grace . Gwen murmured something against Grace 's face . Grace drew a deep breath , as if she meant to make it last the whole time , and lifted her head and stood up straight , though with Gwen 's arm around her still . The mother looked around at them all , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that he was looking down at the black lid of the coffin . But then too much time went by , and the mother did n't say anything . Finally Harold peered at her from under his brows , and she was standing there , looking right at him , and twisting , the little Testament into a roll in her two fists . It was like being hit when he did n't expect it , because her look was begging himp221for help , and her mouth was n't drawn out thin and tight any longer . It was a little open , as if she could n't get enough breath , and her lips were trembling . He looked down again quickly , thinking fiercely , Oh , what does it matter what you say ? Only say something . Say anything . Do n't just stand there till you start to blubber . For Christ 's sake do n't start to blubber with Grace like she is . He closed his hands into fists and pressed them hard against his thighs . The mother began to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queer pauses , and some of the words faded away , as if maybe she would n't get them out at all , but she was n't crying . " I ca n't preach no proper funeral sermon for him , " she said , " and it do n't seem there 'd be much use in it if I could . We all knowed him too well to need much talk about it . " She paused , and started again . " Still , he was a hard one to really know , at that . Seems to me I 'm just learning a lot of things about him I should of knowed all along . But even if I could make out clear every last thing about him , body and soul , and had the words to tell it , I do n't know as it would help . It do n't make no difference to him now , that 's sure , and we 'd all find it out for ourselves soon enough , with him gone . " When she stopped this time , Grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the worst yet . Harold bent his head farther and held himself harder , but the weakness brought innumerable hurrying thoughts and feelings that he could n't stop , and they carried him away from Arthur , not to him . The mother was speaking again , and her voice sounded very loud and much clearer . When he could make out the words too , she was saying , " . . . so if the Lord wo n't judge for me , it surely ai n't my place to pass judgment myself . He was a good man , like he was always a good boy , not a mean streak in him , that I ever see , and that 'll do for us , being mortal ourselves , and the best of us none too good . " But there she lost her way again , and stopped , and when she went on , she sounded as uncertain as she had at first . " Some ways it seems to me he 's with us more now than he ever was before . I keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " Her voice trailed off . " Well , " she said finally , " Harold done wellp222pickin ' this place for him . It 's close to home , and still he liked it about as much as he liked any place , I guess . It was a kind of favorite spot of his . He used to come up here all the time , about now , or maybe a little earlier , about sundown , and set here and watch the light over on the other side , and do some of that whittlin ' he was always at . " Once more Grace made the long , helpless whimper , and this time Harold could n't help looking across at her either . Gwen was holding her in both arms , and crying herself , proudly and silently , with her face up . When he saw them , he could n't hold it down in himself any longer . His tears came suddenly , and blurred the two dark figures together on the other side of the grave . He looked down again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was astonished and ashamed because he was crying . There did n't seem to be any real reason to cry . It was more for them than it was for Arthur . Nothing anybody could say about Arthur went anywhere near as far as a lot of the things he could remember himself . They could n't touch Arthur , any of them . Arthur was the one who was out of it ; he was the 1 quiet center of things . J " Everybody just pray accordin ' to your own heart , " the mother said , her voice breaking , and almost not finishing that much . Harold tried to make a regular prayer for Arthur , but it would n't come , and finally the thought went through his head , all by itself , It would make more sense if it was Arthur praying for us . That was when it got hold of him big , beyond any doubt and beyond any softening it with a living memory , that Arthur was n't there at all , and that he never would be again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just been getting ready for this . He stood very still and tight , not making a sound , and without a thought in his mind , feeling the emptiness go down and down in him . " Amen , " the mother said out loud . The sinking stopped , and then his mind could cry Arthur 's name . He knew that his mouth was closed tight , but it seemed to him that the name , cried out like that , must be echoing all over the valley that was so still now . Arthur , Arthur , his mind cried twice . Then he got the memory that did help . It was asp223if Arthur had come because he 'd called him . He saw Arthur 's long , bearded face quite clearly for a moment . The face was very dark , burned almost the color of an old saddle , the way it got toward the end of summer . The deep-sunk eyes were looking right at him , and they were very sad , but the long , gentle mouth in the beard was making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Arthur had his own reason for making secret fun of the person he was pitying . The mother turned at the head of the grave and started toward the pile of earth with snow on it and the four shovels standing up in it . Then he was n't seeing Arthur 's face any longer , but he was feeling only a quiet , easy sadness and a great weariness . It was a queer weariness , not so much like being really tired as like being suddenly a great deal older , tired from time , not from doing anything . It was n't a bad feeling at all . His own mouth wanted to make the same kind of an easy , crooked smile about it that Arthur 's mouth had made . He believed that he was pretty close to understanding what Arthur had thought about things , close in a surer way than he 'd been that strange , bright , expanding moment in the kitchen . The mother came back to the head of the grave . In her left hand she was carrying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Harold looked down at the lid of the coffin in the pit below him and thought , making that little , crooked smile in his mind , All right , Art , I 'll try and find out . I 'll try and make things go the way you wanted them to . The mother leaned over the grave , and with her right hand took some of the earth from her left , and without saying a word , sprinkled it wide and thin , with a motion like Joe Sam 's when he fed the chickens , over the lid of the coffin . It made only a faint , sandy tapping , like the beginning of rain on hard ground . At the first tapping , Grace made the long , moaning sound again , but softly , half smothering it in Gwen 's shoulder . The mother paid no attention to her , but sprinkled another little handful of earth onto the coffin , and then a third . Then her left hand was empty too . She straightened up , brushed her hands lightly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her left arm and held it in her two hands again . She stood that way for ap224moment , looking down into the grave . Then she raised her head and looked across at Grace and Gwen , and said clearly , " All right , you girls come on down with me now , and let Harold finish up here . " She came around the grave behind Harold and started down the path , and after a moment Gwen turned Grace and the two of them went down more slowly after her , their heads nearly together and their skirts sometimes brushing the light snow from the walls of the path . Harold waited until they went out of sight around the corner of the house . Then he looked across the valley to the east , at the vast , deep blue darkness coming up that curve of the sky out of the white hills , and at the first stars showing in it . He shivereda little , and looked down from the stars at Joe Sam . " All right , Joe Sam , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was standing just where he 'd been standing all the time , at the foot of the grave , and he was still staring down into it . " Joe Sam , " Harold said . He had to speak a third time before Joe Sam raised his head . " We have to get done before it 's too dark . " " Get done , " Joe Sam said , and came around the grave slowly , moving in the thin , darkening air like a swimmer treading water . Harold took the first shovelful of earth , and then paused for a moment , holding it above the open grave . Then he leaned far down and spread it quietly the length of the coffin . He kept on letting the earth down that way , instead of dropping it , until the lid of the coffin was covered and the space around it was filled . Joe Sam did the same thing at the other end . Then they bothtood by the mound and just tossed the earth in . They both swung g rhythmically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pa that sometimes the two shovels swung together , and sometimesfirst one and then the other would swing . As the darkness increased on the hillside , the pines around them became great black columns against a white wall , and below them the small , orange window of the kitchen grew brighter , and so did the longer , yellow window it made on the snow.  |p225Once  more there were only the three of them at the table for supper , Gwen and Harold and Joe Sam . And Joe Sam just sat there again , too , not eating anything , and with his coat and the blue bandana and the black sombrero on . The curving light of the lamp crossed his breast , showing the big wrinkles of the worn coat , and the long hair of the braid that had come undone , lying loose and flat over them . The other braid was beginning to loosen now too , so the ends of the red and blue ribbons stood out from it . In the double shadow of the lamp shade and the brim of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and staring with horror , because the irises made single big centers with the pupils . The big centers were looking right at Harold all the time , or through him at something they saw where the stairs went up against the wall . Harold kept looking away , but every time he looked back , the two big pupils in the faintly glittering whites were still staring at him . Staring back at them , Harold thought , For a while up there , I had a notion he was coming out of it , but I guess it just set him off again . Then he had to look away from the eyes again . I-Ic looked at Gwen , but she was keeping her head down over her plate , and picking at her food , as if she were all by herself . In the long silence , the fluttering of the lamp and the fire and the slow tickingof the clock became voices he did n't want to listen to . Severaltimes he started to say something to Gwen , but then , each time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't speak . He had become afraid of even the sound his fork made on the plate , when suddenly the father 's voice spoke above , angrily and loudly . " It was Curt , I tell you . I saw his coat . I guess I know Curt 's coat when I see it , do n't I ? " P226Then the clock and the fluttering came back , and after a moment , Harold said , " Just talking in his sleep , I guess . " Gwen had looked up quickly when the loud voice spoke , but now she looked down at her plate again . " I left his door open to let some heat up , " she said . She did n't say anything more , and finally Harold asked , " How is Grace doing now ? " " I 'm scared for her , " Gwen said slowly . " She 's quiet enough . She 's too quiet . She just lies there staring . She would n't answer me when I spoke to her . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take on some way . I wish she 'd cry , or do most anything . " " Maybe now it 's all over , she 'll let up after a while . Maybe she 's just worn out with it . " " She 's not letting up any , " Gwen said . She was still keeping herself away from him . She would n't look at him , and she might have been talking to anybody , just to answer the questions . Harold looked at her bowed head intently for a moment , and then set his jaw , and pushed back his chair and stood up . " Well , I better get at the chores , " he said . " Come on , Joe Sam . " The old Indian did n't move . " Joe Sam . " " Why do n't you let him alone ? " Gwen said sharply . He looked at her , and this time she was looking right back at him too . A little fury was dancing in her eyes , almost as wildly as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why do n't you let the poor old man alone ? " she said . " He is n't fit to do chores , and you know it . You 've had him doing everything all the time , and he has n't slept or eaten for days . " Harold stood there looking down at her , and feeling the heat come up his throat and face so he knew it showed . " Are you trying to work him to death ? " Gwen asked . Her voice was higher , and even with his anger finally beginning to rise through his weariness , slow and heavy , he was afraid she 'd start screaming at him so she could n't be stopped , the way Grace had at the mother . She had only started again , though , saying , " Just because he 's old , and an Indian , and does n't know our ways , you . . . " when they heard steps in the north bedroom . Gwen stopped speaking , P227and they both looked at the open door . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright , and then dimmed , and then coming up again , slowly whitening , until finally it was the brightest yet and steady . The mother 's voice said , " Harold . " Gwen looked down at her plate again . " Yes ? " Harold said . " I want to see you before you go out . " His anger turned against the mother and flared . Christ , wo n't you ever let me alone ? he thought . Then he thought , Like Curt again , and you made a promise to Arthur . Somebody has to try around here , and you 're the only candidate right now . " All right , " he said . He looked down at Gwen again . It was so quiet they could hear the bedsprings creak as the mother lay down once more , and even the rustling of her stiff , black dress . He stood there , trying to make Gwen look up at him before he spoke , but she would n't and again it was the father 's voice that broke the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It did , though . I saw it , big as a horse . Listening to that goddamned dreamer , " it moaned , and muttered for a moment , and was silent . Harold said slowly and distinctly , " I was just going to put him to bed up in the bunk-house , if that 'll make you feel any better . " He turned and went to the door of the bedroom . For a moment he was frightened , because he thought , in his dull weariness , that it was Arthur lying there again , and had a couple of wild glimpses of an opening grave and a ghost that carried its dead flesh on it , and could n't be kept out of thee house . The mother was lying straight out on the bed , with the same white blanket pulled up to her chin . Her hands were crossed on her breast on top of the blanket , and her eyes were closed . The wild notion passed , and he thought , though only wearily , What now ? Playing dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or do you just forget that fast ? He went in and stood by the bed , but the mother did n't  |p228o|pen  her eyes or speak . Finally he said , " What did you want , Mother ? " She opened her eyes then , and without moving her head , turned them slowly to look at him . " I was thinking , " she began , hardly moving her lips , but then turned her eyes away from him and let them close again . " It was just a notion I had , " she said . " What was ? " " Never mind . It does n't matter . " " If it 's anything I can do , " Harold said finally . She waited for a long time , and then slowly opened her eyes and looked at him again . " I was just thinkin ' we might keep a fire out front tonight , now it 's clear . " She looked away from him . " But it would n't do no good , I know that , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' we ought a do somethin ' . " " Well , " Harold said , " it would n't do any harm . " The mother rolled her head a little in the pillow to mean no . " You got more'n enough to do the way it is , " she murmured . " It was just a notion . " " I 'll get one going as soon as I 've finished the chores . " The mother did n't move or speak , and after a moment he went back into the kitchen , and lit the lantern and roused Joe Sam . Gwen was still sitting there bowed over her plate . She let them go without saying anything . On the way up the hill , Harold stopped once and looked up at the sky , letting Joe Sam go on up the path alone . All the stars were out sharp and small now , and the constellations were n't broken anywhere until they got down to the hills . He looked north and searched out the Great Dipper , and then the Pole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let alone a fire , he thought , and then , Well , it 's not for him anyway , and felt his weariness settle down upon him full weight again . He felt the cold workinginto him already , through the house-warmth in his clothes . It pinched his nostrils every time he drew a breath . If he 's still out there , he 'd better have a fire for himself , though , he thought , and turned and went on up , climbing with his upright shadow the lantern made on the snow wall of the path . When he came into the bunk-house , the lantern showed him P229Joe Sam , already undressed down to his underwear , and barefooted , but standing by the cold stove again , with his hands out to it . " Get in your bunk , Joe Sam , " he said . " I 'll make you a fire . " He set the lantern down by the stove and went over to the woodpile and began to whittle shavings for kindling . When he came back with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still by the stove , but now he was taking off the underclothestoo . " You better keep those on , " Harold said . " It 's gon na be colder than hell tonight . " The old Indian , his face dead and away by itself , went on taking off the red flannels . Harold stared at him for a moment , but then thought , Have it your own way . Everybody else is , and took an old newspaper from the box behind the stove and wadded it and thrust it down in onto the grate . Then he shook the ashes from under the paper , and tossed the light kindling in , and four bigger sticks on top of it , and lit the paper . When the kindling was burning , he closed the stove door and stood up . Joe Sam was in his bunk and under the covers . He was lying on his side , drawn up like a kid again , and his eyes were closed . Harold waited until he could put chunks on the fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . When the chunks were burning too , Harold picked up the lantern and went out . In a slow , tired walk that was still perfectly regular , so it made a monotony in his mind too , he went down the hill and past the house and out across the yard , all broken into white peaks and walls and long black shadows by the lantern moving through the work of the shovels and the drag . He did the chores in the same dull , steady way , his mind hardly taking hold on anything , and his body working by habit . He broke the ice on the corral trough and forked hay out for the horses the last thing , and then , still walking with his legs only , climbed back up to the woodpile and got his axe . Carrying the axe and the lantern in the same hand , he went down once more , and out of the yard to the south , in the track the drag had made . Where the track curved away east on the rise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went floundering on up through the loose snow above until he came into the big brush the quail liked . He  |p230stam|ped  a circle firm in the snow there , and set the lantern at the side of it . Then he just stood there resting for a while , lookingup at the vast dome of stars over the glimmering valley and the ghostly mountains that closed it in , and down at the brighter , yellow spark that was the bunk-room window . The cold began to work into him again , and far up in the northeast , toward the pass , a coyote cried , small and quavering and desolate . Something in him cried back to it so much in the same voicemade him uneasy . When it happened a second time , he shook himself awake . He moved out beyond the circle and began to knock the snow out of the brush with the axe , and to kick it away from the stems . When he 'd gone as far as the lantern would let him see , he began to hack at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The stems sprang back from the blows , making the axe jump so that his hands tingled , and sometimes it took half a dozen strokes to cut through . He began to strike harder , and to flare with rage when a bush resisted him too long . All right , he thought , if you want a fire , I 'll make you a fire that 'll show to Oregon . There 's nobody to see your goddam fire , but what do we care about a little thing like that . We 'll have a real fire . We 'll burn every goddam bush on the hill . " Never let it be said , " he muttered , feeling the sweat beginning to come on his face , even in that sharp cold , " that a Bridges ever did anything in a small way , even if the small way would be better . Whatever it is , do it big , and do it as fast as you can . " He worked faster , grunting every time he struck . Each time a bush fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and threw it fiercely back into the circle where the lantern was . " Why not burn the damn haystacks , " he growled . " Hell , we 're no pikers , " he muttered . " Burn the sheds , burn the house . Think what a light that 'd make for the coyotes to see . " Later , when his lips were curled back and his breath was hissing in his teeth , he gasped , " It 's Curt 's fire . Do it Curt 's way . " Three times he worked out of the farthest reach of the light , and each time he moved the lantern to another side of the circle . When the pile of brush filled the whole circle and was as tall as P231he was , he rested , bent over and leaning on the axe handle . Littlelights that did n't come from the lantern danced in the night where he looked , like the stars come down and whirling . He closed his eyes , and they were still there . He waited until they slowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breath was coming slower too , and not so much like sobs . He could feel the sweat starting under his armpits now , and running down over his ribs , tickling them . He opened his eyes and looked at the pile of brush . " Even for Curt , that would do , " he said . He still rested , bent over the axe , until the pain in his side was easier and he could breathe with his mouth closed again . The temper went out of him too , while he waited . " Jeez , " he said softly . " Watch it , boy . It 's in you too . " ) Then he saw the whole performance the way it would have looked to someone else , to Arthur , for instance , that rage of cuttingin a little puddle of lantern light , and with the stars there over it all the time , and the big , cold , dark silence of the valley around it . He looked up at the stars and made a little , one-sided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art , " he said . " Have it your way . " He stood the axe head down in the snow by the lantern , and began to hook the cut brush together by its branches . When he had as much in the bunch as he thought would hold , he towed it down into the track of the drag , and along the track into the yard , and across the yard into the center of the big whorl the drag had made turning around at the north end . He made eight trips that way , and then one more to collect the brush that had come loose along the track . He stacked all the brush into one big pile again , in the center of the whorl , and left the lantern besideit , and took the axe back up to the woodpile . He brought four of the cord-cut timbers down from the woodpile and leaned them on end against the brush . He kept on , stubbornly , but very slowly now , carrying down timbers and standing them against the brush until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even then he did n't stop , though he could only carry the timbers two at a time now . He built a stack of them over against the snow wall of the circle . Orion was up over the sheds before he finally stopped to rest once more . He stood looking down at the stack . P232He had no feeling about what he was doing now , and his thoughts about it came slowly and separately , and had no force . " That 'll hold it till daylight , " he said . It would start better with kerosene on it , he thought , but then thought , It 's in the store room . I 'd have to go in the kitchen again . Finally he picked up the lantern and went slowly down to the sheds and around to the lumber room . In the lumber room , he broke up some light boards into kindling , and took them in his arm with a pile of old newspapers from the bench . He started to pick up a bucketful of the black oil they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into the ground . Then he thought of the lantern . He laid the papers and kindling on the bench and fastened the lantern to his belt . Then he picked up the papers and kindling again , and took the bucket of oil in his other hand , and went back to the pile of brush and timber . He thought carefully about each little act now . He wadded the paper and pushed it under the brush in one place , and pushed the kindling in on top of it . Then he poured some of the oil through the brush onto the paper and kindling . Finally he went slowly around the whole pile , splashing the oil in between the timbers until the bucket was empty . He carried the bucket to the edge of the circle , where the track went out of it that passed the house , and set it down as carefully as if it were made of glass . When he straightened up again , he caught his breath for a moment , because Gwen was standing there , so close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face at all in the hood . " I did n't see you there , " he said . " I have n't been here very long , " she said . " I did n't know if you had any matches . " She gave him the matches she was holding . " I made some fresh coffee , " she said . " That 's good , " he said , but then turned away from her at once , because he was afraid he was going to cry . He was so tired it made him want to cry to think of her making the coffee for him . He went back to the pile of brush and timbers , and squatted in front of the place where he 'd put the paper and kindling in . He scratched a match on the nearest timber , held it in his cupped hand until the flame was steady , and then slowly P233put it in until the tip of the flame touched the oily paper . For an instant the flame shrank , and only tiny wisps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a sudden little gasping explosion , and a dark red flame leapt up , making a cloud of black smoke . The flame broke into many flames over the surface of the oily paper , and he stood up and moved back from the pile . The flames drew together and sucked up into the brush . The big flame began to roar , and the brush hissed where there was still snow on it . Then a thin , nervous crackling began . The flame brightened and rushed up into the peak of the tepee , and spread quickly through its base , mostly white and noisy , but breaking out in a new , small explosion and another murky red fire every time it came to oil again . Harold picked up the lantern and moved back into the drag lane , where Gwen was . They stood there together , not looking at each other , but only watching the fire grow . After a few minutesthe flames were bannering high out of the peak of the cone , and the slumping and crashing of settling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibres like glowing wicks that curled and broke off and winked out . The banks of the snow wall began to sink a little and run in the heat . The waving , colored light spread over the snow beyond the circle , and made phantoms that danced along the walls of the house too quickly to take clear shape . For a time , while the blaze was highest , the light on the tower window made it look as if there was a raging fire inside the house too . Only the brightest stars , out around the edges , on the hills , showed beyond the glare . Turning once to look at the fire in the window , Harold saw that the kitchen door was open , and the figure of the mother was standing in it against the lamplight . When the timbers had sunk over each other , burning separatelyin many places , and the column of fire in the center was slower and uncertain , he went into the circle again , and walked slowly around , prodding the timbers in with the heel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was single and steady once more , he came back and picked up the lantern . " That 'll hold for a while , " he said . He waited until she had turned and gone ahead of him into the path , and then he followed her slowly . P234The mother was n't in the kitchen when they came in , but the Testament she 'd carried in the afternoon was lying open at her place at the table , with an empty coffee mug beside it . Haroldset the lantern on the table , and took off his cap and stuffed it into his pocket . Then he slowly turned the lantern down until it went out . The warmth of the room closed on him like first sleep , and he stood there staring at the Testament and thinking , as if he were reading a title page , The words of Christ are printed in red . Gwen 's voice said , " You 'd better take your coat off , Harold , " and he obeyed like one in a trance . He hung the coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in the chair . After a minute he put his elbows on the table , and rested his head in his hands . Gwen set a mug of coffee beside him , and went around and sat down across from him with hers . She began to sip at her coffee , but Harold could n't bring himself to move . After a few sips , Gwen set her mug down again. " 1 ) o you have to keep it going all night ? " she asked . She spoke very quietly , because of the three open doors , and because the testament and the empty coffee mug between them made a kind of bodiless deputy there . " What ? " he asked , and lifted his head to look at her . " The fire . Do you have to keep it going all night ? " He nodded . " I guess so . " Gwen was silent , looking at him , and thinking something she would n't say . Then she said , smiling a little , " You 'd better drink your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess so , " he said again , but did n't move to pick it up . After a minute , Gwen said , " I 'd better go see how Grace is , I guess . I 'll be right back . " Harold smiled at her faintly , and nodded , and she got up and went quietly into the bunk-room . Harold sat there staring in front of him until he began to hear the clock . Then he pushed the mug of coffee aside and laid his head down on his arms on the table . P235It was morning in the kitchen , and Harold was very happy , because Arthur was sitting there across from him , whittling at one of the wooden cats , and getting ready to make another of the little jokes you had to think about too . But just when he looked up to speak , someone far away began screaming . Then Arthur was n't smiling at all . He was leaning across the table , staring with terrible eyes that had only pupils and no irises . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were . " Hal , " he cried softly , " Hal . " He reached across under the lamp and took hold of Harold 's shoulder . " Hal , " he said again , no louder , but even more urgently , and began to shake him gently . Then suddenly there was only an empty coffee cup in his place , and the barred chair-back showing above the table . The kitchen was much smaller and darker too , and the stairs were behind the empty chair , not behind Harold , where they should have been . The shaking went on , though , and he heard his name again . He looked up , and it was Gwen standing beside him , with her hand still on his shoulder . She was saying something quick and frightened to him , but he could n't understand it yet . Grace was there too , standing by the stove and hugging the old bathrobe around her . She was staring at him almost the way Arthur had been staring at him . He was frightened , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been frightened , and now he was gone . " What ? " he asked Gwen . " Something 's at the horses . " " The horses ? " He struggled to his feet and looked around at the front window . Then he saw that it was n't morning at . all . The window was full of darkness , with only a faint , red light wavering across the little Alps of plowed snow outside . " Yes , the horses , " Gwen said sharply . The mother 's voice behind them said , " Harold , do n't you go out there now . There 's been enough ... "   " Harold , wake up , " Gwen cried . " I 'm awake , " he said , " only I do n't ... " " It 's black as pitch out there , " the mother said angrily , and he could tell she was coming toward them from the bedroom . The scream came again . It was the same one he 'd heard while Arthur was there . It trailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then he was sure that it came from outside , and understoodwhat Gwen had been trying to tell him . He started toward the door . " Harold , " the mother cried , to stop him , and Gwen was comingafter him , crying , " Ilere , Harold , take the gun . If it 's that painter again ... " Even Grace 's voice cried shrilly now , " Harold , do n't be a fool , " and then the loud , heavy voice called down from above , " What in hell 's going on down there ? " He was already at the door , and had it partly open , but this voice was so different from the women 's voices flocking after him like beaked birds that he stopped and looked up . The father was up there , enormousand faceless in the shadow . He leaned over the rail so that part of his face and one eye came out of the shadow of the platform , and said angrily , " What 's going on ? I asked you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the knife and the carving in his hands and that horror beginning to come on his face was still what was real , and the rest of this was a bad dream he 'd fallen asleep into . But Arthur had heard the screaming too , and tried to tell him something about it . He went on out the door , with someone catching at his sleeve , and saying something he did n't understand because the father 's big voice was saying , " What 's burning out there ? Damned fire woke me up . Are you all . . . " but then he was outside and could n't hear the rest , but only the rumbling of the voice in the house . Still heavy with sleep , so that the fear was alive in him by itself , but he was n't alive around it yet , he heard the horse make the shrill , sudden screams twice more , close together . The sound was much louder now , and it made something go swiftly and coldly up his back , raising the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the snow , with voices still calling behind him When he got out of the light from the doorway , he missed the path somewhere . He floundered on across through the deep P237snow with the far-away firelight moving the shadows on it , and came into the tunnel between the sheds with snow on him up to the waist . Between the dark bars of the corral gate at the other end of the tunnel , he could see the horses all running in a shadowy bunch along the far fence . The wildest pounding was separate from them , though , and nearer , and then the terrible , sudden cry of the horse came again , and it was very near . It shook him like a blow . A horse in the bunch on the other side nickered like a whimper , and then another and another took up the sound of fear , and suddenly , piercing as a steam whistle , the scream came again . It came suddenly each time , as if struck from the lungs by sharp pain . Harold came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center pole . He was filled with a murderous rage now , and at the same time he wanted to run back into the greater dark- J ness of the tunnel and watch from there , with the wall behind ! him , ready to defend himself . This straining balance held him motionless at the gate through three quick screams . Then the cold man 's mind said , There 's no black painter . You 're sunk in two dreams , that 's all , Joe Sam 's and the one you had in there . You fell asleep on the table . He climbed onto the gate , not wanting to be caught between the poles if it was a cat in there after all . He knew that Gwen had somehow got there right after him , but he hardly felt her clutchingat his shirt , and did n't understand anything of what she was saying so rapidly . He wished he had the lantern , though . He wanted light . From his high post astride the top bar , he could see only the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkness by the shed . He could n't make out at all what was at it , but only a thickening and blurring of its forelegs and shoulders . The horse suddenly screamed and leaped again , and in spite of himself , a belief in the black panthertook hold of him for a moment . He felt how helpless he was against it too , against any kind of a cat , without a weapon that would keep it from reaching him . " Gwen , get back , " he said fiercely , but all the time watching the dark plunging by the shed , no clearer than a cloud moving on a night sky . " Get away from here , out of the tunnel . " He felt her hand leave him , but she was still talking at him . " DidP238you hear me ? " he said . " Get out . If it breaks . . . " Then he did n't hear her voice any longer either . He watched the plunging , waiting , and when it came toward the gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hi-ya , hi-ya , hi-ya , " in the high , piercing tone he used to harry the cattle , or turn a steer that threatened him . With his second yelp , the tortured horse screamed again , and the rest of his cry was small and lost , but this time the pattern of the battle was broken anyhow . The horse reared and crashed against the shed , its weight cracking the poles , its hoofs rattling down them , and spun suddenly back along the wall , and out free in a long curve into the center of the corral . The nervous bunch swung and streamed away along the far rail with dull , numerous thunder , leaving it in lone silhouette against the starlit snow , and Harold guessed it was Kentuck . Then the enemy came out into the starlight after it , gliding quickly and soundlessly , like a soft-footed dancer , stooping , and maneuvering to keep the big stallion from getting in with the bunch . Harold said softly , " The damn little bastard , " and let himself down into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt again , and heard Gwen 's voice crying , " Hal , do n't go in there . Hal , take the gun ; here 's the gun , " and then again , when she lost her hold as he moved away , " Harold , take the gun , you fool . " He said angrily , over his shoulder , " Quit yelling , will you ? It 's all right . It 's only Joe Sam . " " Joe Sam , " he called sharply . The little figure still danced on the snow , cutting off the stallion that moved slowly now , trying to run , but stumbling each time , and only turning away in a limping trot . " Joe Sam , " he yelled again . The little figure straightened up in the center of the corral and stood waiting . " Harold , " Gwen said , " do n't go out there . He 's crazy . " " He 'll be all right now , " Harold said . " He heard me , and he knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the same , watching the old Indian for any sudden move , stopping beyond his reach and peering , trying to see him better . The old man was naked again , even in this cold that was already shortening Harold 's breath , but P239there was something about the shape he made against the snow/ that was n't right . Behind him the horses were running again , to keep away from the black . When he slowed to a walk and turned across the open at them , they waited , moving restlessly in a small space and only nickering a little , until he was within two or three lengths of them . Then they milled suddenly , several of them rearing like a shadowy surf , and lined out again , streamingback around the fence . Kentuck stood then , blowing heavily , only turning his head to watch them . Joe Sam turned a little too , at the sound of the running , and Harold saw it was his hair that was wrong . It hung down tentwiseover his shoulders and back , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braid must have come all undone too . He looks like a Digger , Harold thought . Like damncave man . Well , no. bottle neck , anyway . But he 's got something , he thought suddenly . He did n't make the stud scream like that with his hands . " What have you got there , Joe Sam ? " he asked . " In your hand ? " " No got , " Joe Sam muttered . Still playing possum , Harold thought . He is n't giving up yet . " What 's in your hand ? I asked you . " After a moment , Joe Sam said , " Arthur give . Arthur my friend . " " Drop it , " Harold said . Still the old man kept his hands in the dark by his sides . It was hard to wait against this stubbornness , and with no way to guess , in the dark , what he was thinking , but Harold waited , only holding himself ready to move quickly , in case the old habit of his authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thwarted remnant of the strange fury . The waiting and the cold won for him . When the old Indian spoke at last , he was pleading . " Arthur give . My friend give . Please , I keep . " " All right , " Harold said . " You can keep it , but give it to me now . " He held out his hand . Joe Sam made some small movement with the object , in the P240dark against his side , and then slowly reached out and laid it on Harold 's hand . Harold felt the corrugated bone of the handlethrough the slippery , still warm wetness on it . " Kill black painter , " Joe Sam said . Black painter , hell , Harold thought . You ca n't dream that hard , and felt with his forefinger along the base of the blade , where the blood was already cool and thickened . The blade was worn narrow as a dagger 's with long use and much sharpening . It was Arthur 's knife , all right , however Joe Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tunnel ? No , or why all that trickery with the clumsy bottle neck ? It must have been when he put his gifts into the coffin , then . The mother , knowingit was Arthur 's treasure , must have put it in the black suit when she changed his clothes . " Kill black painter , " Joe Sam insisted . " Black painter kill Arthur . " He was beginning to shake now . The shaking was in his voice . Harold squatted and thrust the blade of the knife through the hoof packed snow into the dung and earth of the corral . and worked it there to clean it . Then he rubbed the handle with snow too , and cleaned his hands in it , and stood up . IIe wiped the knife on his jeans , closed it , and stood tossing it slowly on the palm of his hand and looking at Joe Sam . " It was no black painter , " he said finally , " and you know it . It was Kentuck . You knifed Kentuck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Joe Sam said again , but now without conviction . His teeth began to chatter , and he hunched himself a little . He knew , all right , Harold thought . Because it was Curt 's horse , maybe ? The one that made him dodge ? " Harold , what is it ? " Gwen called . " He was knifing the black stud . Curt 's . " " Oh , the poor horse . Why ? " She was coming out to them now . " Wait a minute , " Harold called . " We 're coming . " " Black painter not dead , " Joe Sam said mournfully . " Not kill . You stop . " Or did fie know ? Harold thought . How can you guess what P241he sees ? He slipped the knife into the pocket of his jeans , and took off his shirt and held it out to Joe Sam . " Here , put this on . " The old Indian suddenly shook so violently he could hardly stand , but made no move to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie pleaded between chattering teeth . " All right , " Harold said . " I 'll give it back to you . But you have to get some sleep first . Get up in the bunk-house and get warm . " He held out the shirt again , but the old man still just stood there , his head bowed and his body jerking , and he had to put the shirt on him . Then he took his arm , feeling how thin it was in the big sleeve of the shirt , like a starving child 's . " Come on , old man , " he said gently . " Get to bed now . Get warm . " Joe Sam took the first step with him , but then he made a little , whimpering sound , and sagged forward , and Harold had to take him up in his arms . He was astonishingly light . Old bird bones , Harold thought . Dried out with age , or burned out with seeing things . His pride weighed more than he did , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate . Gwen came to meet him quickly , peering at Joe Sam , and asking , " Is he hurt , Hal ? " " I do n't think so . Worn out and half-frozen , I guess . And the fit 's off him . That knocks him out sometimes . Let the bars down , would you , please ? " Gwen hurried ahead and let the poles down at one end , and l larold went through with his burden . " By rights it 's the horse I ought to look at first , " he said . Gwen , raising the bars again , asked , " Is he hurt bad ? " " I do n't know yet , but it was no fun for him . The old foolhad Arthur 's knife . " Gwen hesitated , with the top pole still in her hands . " Do n't go in there , " Harold said . " He 's crazy afraid still . I 'll be back as quick as I can . " He started through the tunnel . Gwen slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying the rifle . " Can I help ? "   " You could get the lantern , if you would , and a halter from the harness room . And get a coat on too . " " How about some hot water and rags ? " " We 'll need them , I guess . And carbolic too . It 's on the window ledge in the harness room . " Where the drag lane crossed in front of the house , he turned and went up the hill to the bunk-house . Although he was shiveringhimself now , he had to go slowly , digging his toes in , because the cold had made the path glassy . On the level in front of the bunk-house , the snow squealed under his feet . He raised Joe Sam higher in his arms , sprung the latch with the hand that was under his shoulders , and pushed the door open with his knee . He crossed the room and laid Joe Sam down in his bunk . Then he closed the door , lighted the lamp and came back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , worked him into his own red flannels and got him under the covers . At once Joe Sam drew himself together , hugging his knees . Harold stood looking down at him while he put on his shirt again . Joe Sam was still shivering and breathing jerkily . His eyes were closed , and his face , half veiled by his long hair , looked tight and hollowedas an old skull . I No possum this time , Harold thought . It 's done , and there 's /not too much between him and being dead . He built the fire up again , and brought the top quilt from his own bunk and laid it over Joe Sam too . Then he took Arthur 's knife out of his pocket , and stood bouncing it a little on his hand while he looked down at the old , secret face . Finally he leaned over , turned back the covers , and pressed the knife in between Joe Sam 's hands and knees . The right hand closed around the knife , and when Harold had pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go of something in him , and loosened under the covers , as if he had caved in . But then his breathing began again , slow and even and quiet , and the little fear that had started in Harold thinned away to nothing . He crossed to the lamp and blew it out , and came back through the imps of firelight to the door . He looked at Joe Sam once more , and went out , and closed the door softly . From the step , he saw the lantern , like a big , soft star , going into the tunnel be- P243tween the sheds , and he hurried going down , as much as he could on the slick snow . When he came into the tunnel , he saw Gwen already inside the corral gate , but waiting there uncertainly , and when he was closer , he saw the big stallion still in the center of the corral , watching her with his head lowered . His eyes shone hollowly in the lantern light , as if from a burning inside him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Gwen 's hand . " Do n't get too close , " he said . " He does n't know you . " He moved out slowly toward the stallion . It waited quietly , only lifting its head higher to watch when he was close . When he was beside it , though , and raised a hand to touch the bulging shoulder , the stallion flinched away . He spoke to it softly and steadily , and after a moment , still murmuring , moved to it again . This time Kentuck bore his touch , only starting a little at first , and then trembling . Harold worked the halter on and clicked the snap shut . The rest of the horses stood in a line against the far fence , watching , and making only small movements of uneasiness , snorting their breath out white into the starlight . Gwen came up with the lantern and Harold 's coat . She held the coat out to him . " I thought you 'd want this . " Harold held his hands down into the light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He rinsed his hands in snow again , and took the coat and put it on . " Thanks , " he said . " It 's not too warm out here , at that . " Gwen held the lantern up , and they could see the blood on Kentuck 's neck and shoulder too then . It had no color on the black hide , but shone where it was still flowing . " We better take him in the stall , " Harold said . " The others do n't like it . " He put a hand on the halter , and began to coax Kentuck toward the gate . " They look bad , " Gwen said , raising a hand toward the gashed shoulder , but not touching it . " Bad enough , " Harold said , " but they 're just on that one side , anyway . He 's dry on the other side . " " Why would Joe Sam do a thing like that ? " " He says he thought it was the black panther . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? " " I do n't know . But he 'll never say anything different now . You can bet on that . " Gwen let down the bars , and raised them again behind Kentuck . She picked up the kettle and cloths and the bottle of carbolic she 'd set down by the fence , and followed Harold and the big stallion into the tunnel . In the one stall , which was just a corner boarded off in the hay shed , Harold tied Kentuck to the manger , and they looked at the wounds again , holding the lantern up close . There were eight cuts , like small , moving mouths , all on the shoulder and the neck just off the shoulder . One of them , high behind the shoulder , was still bleeding with a pulse , new blood squeezing out at each beat . " The poor thing , " Gwen said . Twisting her face as if the pain of the cuts were in her own body , she raised a hand toward the creeping blood again , but did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be worse , though , " Harold said . " I thought out there they were worse . " He hung the lantern on a nail in the rafter above , and eased a hand onto Kentuck 's shoulder , between two wounds . " Wild with that knife , was n't he , boy ? " he murmured . " But you were n't giving him much time to pick his target , were you , boy ? No , not you . And a good thing for you , you did n't , too . It has a long blade , that knife , for something just to whittle with . " Kentuck flinched , and jerked his head up until the rope checked him , and rolled his eyes till the whites showed staringly , but then let the hand explore . " How that little , old guy ever got in that many wallops , " Harold said , in the same voice for Kentuck to hear , and shook his head . " He must have hung on like a burr . " Then he talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low and smooth and constant , while he washed the blood off and bathed the wounds with the warm water . Finally only that one , high wound , where the knife had gone in straighter and deeper , was bleeding . The red , small lips of the cut showed clearly now , and the new blood squeezing between them in the slow rhythm of the big heart . " Now 's when it begins to get touchy , " Harold said . P245He got an old , battered grain pan out of the manger , and rinsed it and filled it with water from the kettle . He poured a little spurt of the carbolic into the water , corked the bottle , and set it in the far corner . Then he dipped a rag into the solution and stirred it slowly . " Keep away from his hind end , " he said , straightening up with the rag in his hand . He waited until Gwen had moved into the corner by the manger , and then began the quiet patter of talk again . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , quickly , he put the rag to the bad wound and squeezed it and wiped along the edges of the cut . After a moment , Kentuck fought back on the rope , his head jerking up , and then suddenly , he trumpeted , an ear-splitting sound in the close stall , and jerked so the timbers of the manger creaked , and struck with his haunch , and then twice with his hoofs against the side of the stall . Harold kept a shoulder against his shoulder , though , moving with him , and still working at the wound until he was satisfied it was clean . " Take it easy , boy , " he said . " Take it easy . That 's the worst of it . The rest of it 's nothing to that . Just a little sting , maybe , " and kept up the patter , stroking the big flank and the neck above the wounds , until Kentuck stood quiet again . Then he moved slowly away from his shoulder , and soaked the rag in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This time he dabbed and squeezed at three of the cuts before the burning started , and then Kentuck only sidled a little , and rapped the boards once , trying to turn his head to see back . Three times more Harold soaked the rag and came back , coaxing all the while in the soft , monotonous voice . Twice he was shouldered away heavily , and several times Kentuck snorted and flinched , but then the job was done , and with his hand that did n't sting , and still the soft chatter , Harold quieted him a last time . " He 'll be all right now , " he said . " If he is n't bleeding inside somewhere , and I do n't think he is . " He took the carbolic back to the harness room and returned with a blanket . He covered the shoulders with warm , wet rags , and laid a piece of dry sheeting over them , and then threw the blanket on over the sheeting . Then he took the pan of reddened P246solution out and poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands in the snow too . Finally he forked hay down into the rack , and brought the pan full of grain and a bucket of water . Kentuck drank thirstily , draining the pail , and Harold brought it full again . Kentuck drank only a little this time , and then nuzzled the surface , blowing softly , and swung his dripping muzzle and blew in the grain . He lipped up a mouthfulof the grain and raised his head and began to munch , only stirring restlessly now and then from the itch and fading sting of the cuts . Gwen came back to his shoulder and caressed the blanket , murmuring comforts . Her face was still a little twisted at the thought of the wounds , and the hot cure that must have seemed like stabbing again , and because of the blood she had ) longed to touch . When Harold turned from lengthening the hitch rope , he blundered against her . She turned quickly , lookingup at him , and caught his coat tightly in her two fists . Her eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had moved in her also because of the blood , and she cried up softly at Harold , in the voice she 'd used to Kentuck , " Oh , darlin ' , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . " She kept tugging at his coat with one hand , but slid the other up over his shoulder and behind his head . " I 've been horrible , darlin ' , I know . But it was n't you ; it was n't you , really . I just could n't , with all . . . " and finished in broken murmuring against him . He held her tightly , and then , when she tugged at him less , the small , hard body softening in his arms , loosened his hold a little too , and lifted her chin with a big knuckle crooked under it , and put his mouth down to hers . Her head fell back , and she bent limply to him in his circling arm , letting it bear almost all her weight . Her lips parted , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mind thundered at this joining after the long weariness and the separation the motherad made . He jerked back the hood from her hair , and holding that hand under her head , hunted with his mouth along her throat and shoulder , and then back along her face until he found her mouth again . Then they clung there , under the low , burning lantern , and almost against Kentuck 's shoulder . Ken- P247tuck swung his head , munching and dripping a little at the mouth , and watched them curiously . When the wish that bound them ebbed a little , being too long denied , Harold turned Gwen , almost roughly , still holding her close in his arm , and led her , half lying against him , and both of them stumbling , into the shed beyond . The light of the lantern came in there through the cracks of the board partition , making thin lines of brightness over the mounds of hay , and a dry sweetness stirred in the cold air where they moved . They sank together against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harold lay over against her , murmuring her name like the soft echo of a cry that would break him , and fingered her throat and cheek and temple with a trembling hand . " Darling , " she sighed , " oh , my darling , " and closed her eyes again , and drew his shoulder down toward her . " Harold , " the voice called , from outside and a distance , and they lay still exactly where they were , his face close above hers , but not yet touching . After a moment Gwen turned her face into his shoulder , pressing hard , and made a long , soft moan that was muffled by his coat . Harold 's hand lay in the nape of her neck still , curved as it had been in his last caress , but not moving now , not even pressing . " Oh , damn her , " he whispered , " God damn her to hell . Will she never . . . " but stopped there , choked by the quick fury . " Harold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head back quickly , whispering , " She 's coming out here , Harold , " and stiffened away from him . Then there was only the knowledge again , almost like hatred , of the clumsy winter garments between them , and of the mother 's will . It was as if their own wills , and the sweet , savage desire that had fused out of them , were sucked away to nothing , leaving them separate and ashamed and wanting to hide , most of all from each other . Harold loosened his hold , and Gwen struggled to her feet at once and moved away two steps toward the door , and stood there with her back turned . After a moment Harold got up too and stood behind her . They waited , separated and listening , the thin bars of light from the stall across them and the P248motes they had stirred from the hay spinning among themselves in the narrow gleams . " Harold , " the mother 's voice called again , from much nearer . " You 'll have to answer her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him , and began hurriedly brushing the hay from her skirt and cloak . The quick rage whirled in Harold again , and he could n't keep it out of his voice , shouting , " Here . What do you want ? " But then he began brushing the hay off himself too . " Is Gwen out there too ? " the mother called . The voice came from no closer now . She had stopped when he called . " Yes , she 's here , " he called , but then could n't help adding , " She 's helping me . The black stud is hurt . Kentuck . " Gwen looked up at him , and then straightened up from her brushing , and drew the hood over her head and moved away into the lantern light in the stall . She stood in there by the outside door , with her back to him and her head bent . The lantern made her shadow like a praying nun on the door . He passed her and opened the d &; The mother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across . " You 're letting the fire go out , " she said . " I ca n't do twenty things at once , " Harold said , and again f felt the guilt of a half lie , and how dirty the sweet wildness had - urned now . " I 'll get it in a minute , " he added wearily . " The girl had to take care of it for you once before , " the mother told him . " While you caught up on your sleep . " Harold just stood there , not answering , and finally she said , " Well , you better fix it , and then come in before you freeze . " Harold came back into the stall and took down the lantern and picked up the kettle . Gwen waited for him outside , and when he had closed the door , went on slowly ahead of him , toward the house . The mother was already standing in the open kitchen door . When she saw the lantern moving away from the shed , she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the path . Harold turned off in the drag lane and went out to the fire , The timbers had burned apart and there were only small , separate flames at their ends , and the great pile of shimmering embers in the center . Harold worked slowly around the circle , P249kicking the timbers farther in . Then he set the kettle and lantern down , and brought more timbers from the pile and tossed them on . When the flames drew together again , and began to rise at the center , he picked up the lantern and kettle and turned toward the house . Gwen was waiting for him where the drag had crossed the path , but when he was nearly to her she went on ahead and into the house alone . The father was the only one in the kitchen when they came in . He was sitting at the table , playing Black-Jack against himself . There was a pile of matches on each side of him , but the pile by his right hand was much larger than the one by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of it stood by the right pile . He lifted the glass and drank and made a long , sighing " Ah . " Then he set the glass down again , and looked at them . " No sign of Curt yet ? " he asked . Harold shook his head . " Two o'clock in the morning , " the father said angrily . " Almosttwo in the morning , and the young fool 's not back yet . " And now he 's dropped two days clean out , Harold thought . Well , if you have to lose two days , they were good days to lose . Does he know Arthur 's dead ? I wonder . Gwen turned and moved off toward the bunk-room , and the father peered after her . " Little game of Black-Jack , young woman ? " he asked loudly . Without giving any sign that she 'd heard him , Gwen went on slowly and turned into the dim light of the bunk-room , and disappeared , letting the light fill the door again by itself behind her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the father asked Harold . " Creepin ' around here like a damned ghost , " he muttered . " Wo n't even answer a civil question . To hell with her then . " He looked at Harold and held up the cards . " What about you ? " he asked . " It 's no fun robbing myself , " he said , and snorted happily at his joke , and began to fish clumsily in his vest for a cigar . " I guess not now , thanks , " Harold said , and having spoken , could move again too . He started toward the stove . " And what 's wrong with cards , may I ask ? " " Nothing , " Harold said . P250did the kettle onto the stove and blew out the lantern it up on the shelf . Then he sat down in the mother 's cross from the father . The old man stared at him fiercely iinute , his heavy , black brows drawn together and his poring in his nose , but Harold would n't look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth of contempt , uck a match to light his cigar . The match made a ike another snort . When the cigar was drawing well , hed it between his teeth in the right corner of his mouth , sing his right eye against the smoke , and flipped two at , face down , and then two more on top of them , face me of clubs on one and a queen of hearts on the other . the rest of the deck ready , he looked at Harold again. e a drink ? " thanks . " father stared again . " Everybody getting holier than he said . " A whole goddam houseful of preachers , " he d , and then , after a moment , asked , " What 's the matter au sick ? " i Harold just shook his head , he snorted again . " To hell a too , then , " he said . " To hell with the whole , sniveling , oody bunch of you . What a family for a man who ... " k a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ime it took to put his glass down , his expression became nd calculating . He peered at his hole cards. me easy , " he said for the right-hand cards. arned up a four of spades and chuckled . " That 's just ight , just about right , " he said. ld watched him turning the cards for a while , though apty , unseeing eyes . Then he folded his arms on the front of him , and laid his head down on them. ' ather went on flipping the cards out and talking to himnetimes , catching a glimpse of a card as it came off the ' d say quickly , " Turn one under . House rule , " and turn he bottom of the deck , and flip the next one out instead . Ter he could move another match onto the right-hand would chuckle and pause in the game and take a sip of k . P253Far below , Kentuck moved into the shadow of the pines again . The red coat across his saddle darkened and vanished , and did not reappear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the slow settling of the flakes , and nothing else had moved , Curt drew a deep breath , let it out slowly , and looked down at his bare hand holding the sombrero , as if surprised to see it . Then he turned and climbed back up to where the cowhide parka lay on the snow , with the snow-shoes beside it , and the little pile of things he had taken out of the red coat . He laid the sombrero down carefully , like something brittle , and picked up the parka . He spread the parka in front of him between his two hands and looked at it . He moved the torn flap on the shoulder of it with his forefinger . Except for the fierce black moustache , which seemed alive by itself , his face was that of a sleep walker . Finally he slipped the parka on over his head , knotted the belt around his waist , and drew up the hood . The coat was very heavy , but the sleek , quilted lining felt warm and kind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on both sides . After a moment he pushed it back and let it hang between his shoulders . Then in the same way , slowly and dreamily , he stuffed the oilskin packet into his left pocket , slid the knife into its sheath and dropped it and the cartridges and the matches into the right pocket , slung the bear-paws onto his back , and drew on his mittens . The black sombrero with the rattlesnake band was left alone on the snow . He picked it up , bending stiffly because of the bear-paws , and stood holding it and staring P254at it as he had stared at the parka . Finally he rolled it until he could hold it in one hand , and turned and looked down through the stone gate again , at the edge where he had sent Kentuck over . Once the wind moved , making soft flutings in the rocks above him , and the pines down there stirred and whispered and dropped clots of snow , which broke and thinned away into little veils over the ravine . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep breath and sighed , as if reluctant to move , and then lie turned and started up the trail . He stopped under the wall of the Cathedral Rock and pushed the rolled sombrero into a crevice in the granite , thinking , from the surface of his closed mind , and without interest , I 'll get it when I come back . He went on up to where the carbine leaned against the rock , and picked it up and stood looking at it . Finally he took off his right mitten and stuffed it into the left pocket of the parka , beside the oilskin packet . Then he stood staring again , at the marks of the scuffle in the snow , with sand and brittle manzanitaleaves strewn over them , and the long , bare place across the center where Arthur 's body had melted through . Finally he looked slowly around at the confused circle of the big cat prints , like broken flowers . " No matter what color you are , " he said softly . " No matter what color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Once more the oath released him . He cradled the carbine in his right arm , and began to climb again . Out of old habit , for he was n't really thinking about anything now , he climbed slowly but steadily , keeping each step short enough to be easy , and flat-footed and a trifle pigeon-toed , so that the soft pacs gripped firmly in the snow or on stone . The same habit made him walk carefully beside the tracks of the cat and not in them , and glance up ahead every now and then , to guard against ambush , and to be sure the trail made no big swing within sight . Unless the cat had been badly hurt , it would be a long hunt . He 'd been sure of that as soon as he 'd seen the long fork of the trail going up and north , and taking its time . The thing was to keep the bastard moving until you got a good shot ; do n't give him a chance to rest , do n't give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time . If he 'd been P255hurt bad , it would be different , of course . You might come up with him in an hour or two . It all depended on how much of a head start he had . And he might have been hurt bad , at that . There were still flecks of blood showing sometimes between the flower prints . Maybe Arthur had hit him with that one shot . But you could n't count on that . You had to count on a long hunt , and take it slow and steady , just keeping the pressure on the bastard all the time , only keeping your eyes open too , because if he was hurt so he could n't keep running , he 'd be waiting for you somewhere , up on a ledge , as he had for Arthur . His mind did n't really consider these possibilities , which were all familiar from many hunts . It merely tabulated them , turned the tracking over to his body , and closed around the little fears and the flights about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and having to send him home face down over a saddle . The slow , steady motion of his climbing lulled him , and the floating mists slowly parting above him and the diffused radiance that filtered through them , made it like climbing in a dream on a mountain that was n't real . Even in the upper woods , the dream persisted for a while . The light was only a half light , and the shadows of the trees were only half shadows , the moving vapors blending and transformingthem . The sleep thinned out when the track of the cat disappeared among the trees up ahead , or when a sudden sound or movement near him demanded attention , but his eyes quickly found the track again , always farther up and a little farther north , or at once explained the interruption : a bough had dropped its burden of snow and sprung back higher , or a junco had launched off a chinkapin twig and flitted away clownslope , and his attention withdrew from the world again . He had no sense at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was transformed like the shapes of the mist , seeming now to be none at all , and now to be half a lifetime , a kind of sum of all the winter hunting he had ever done . As he approached the crest of the first ridge , however , the timber thinned out , and the wind , drawing down at him out of the northwest , grew colder and stronger . It broke the mist open in many places , making little , spasmodic blizzards over an acre or two of the mountain , and clearing the air between P256them and after them . Where it had passed , the light entered in full strength , and was painfully bright on the snow . The cold and the dazzle fretted him , and after two of the small , whirling blizzards had sucked over him , nicking his face and making him close his eyes and bow his head , he drew up the hood of the parka , and that woke him still more . His eyes did n't trust themselves to watch alone in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was powdering over the cat 's tracks , and felt a little alarm , and a need to climb faster . So it was that he saw the cat , where he might have missed it half an hour before . The trail led him out to the edge of a deep ravine , and then turned almost straight up toward the crest . The trees below him in the ravine , and over on the far wall too , were larger than those about him , all old , twisted growth in an insecure rooting of sand and boulders among patches of brush . He paused on the edge , with no purpose except to look down , and the tiny movement on the far side , high up , near the head of the ravine , a movement less than that of a fly on a window rubbing its wings , caught his eye . In an instant he was wide awake . The cat was distinct in tiny , black silhouette against the snow , just below the skyline . It must have moved , for the movement was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly still , and broadside to him , though above him . The north wing was higher than the one he stood on , with a bald ridge , clear of timber and broken only by shapes of rock . He believed the cat was standing with its head turned at him , but he could n't be sure . It was too far across the airy upper spread of the ravine . The sudden pain of guilt and loss his mind let out into him moved him as if his insides were being twisted , but he did n't know it . He believed the catch in his breath came from excitement , for he was trembling , as he slowly turned the carbine in his hands . The weakness angered him . God Almighty , he thought , I 'm like a kid on his first time out , and forced himself to move slowly and attentively . Even so a tiny dancing remained in his hands and his knees , and there was n't time to wait it out . Shaking like a goddam girl , he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing shot , but let himself down behind P257it instead , bracing his left elbow upon his raised left knee and bringing his eye over behind the sight in the same movement . He 's above me , he thought , and the wind 's a little downcanyon , though mostly from him to me , and made allowance for those variations even while he was drawing the breath to hold . The cat moved , advancing a step or two and starting to turn up . Curt held himself with difficulty , and did n't make the quick useless shot he wanted to . The cat stopped again . He was sure it was looking across at him now . He let his breath half out and held it , lifting his sight again toward the center he had chosen , just above and ahead of the shoulder , and slowly squeezing the trigger to slip home just when the least tip of the sharp front sight came there . Only a guess how far , he thought . Hard to guess over a canyon , like this . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cat moved again , though only slightly , just as the trigger 's tension broke . While Curt was still enveloped in the roar of the report , the tiny black cat on the point of the sight jerked visibly , a twin jerk , it seemed to him , with that of the butt in his shoulder . Hit , the black bastard , he thought , like a white flash of joy in his head . But at once the flash dimmed while the report was spreading , for the tiny cat turned above the sight and went up in leaps toward the place where the north ridge became the mountain . Moved , the bastard , he thought fiercely , while he was leaping to his feet and springing the lever of the carbine , and lifting it to his shoulder again . The echoes fired back the first shot from the far wall , twice sharply , once more slowly and thickly , and finally , just as he thought , Nearly stern on , and bobbing ; high , left , and come down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prolongedroaring below . The carbine leapt again , but while the blow of the new report still closed his ears , and without a hitch in its smooth bounding , the cat became an instant hair upon the bald summit , and was gone , The thin receding scream of the ricochet went into the sky behind it . Clean miss , the bastard , the goddam bastard , Curt raged , pumping a new cartridge home with the words . But then he held the carbine lowered , and the ravine returned his fire mul- P258tiplied , exactly as before , two sharp , one muffled and slower , and the roaring like a rockslide down out of sight . Still hearing the ricochet , like a white rocket streak up across the black roaring , he knew there had been none after the first shot . The thunder dimmed away among the boulders below , and he thought , more slowly , Maybe fleshed it at that . Or got sand , he warned himself . He turned up along the edge of the ravine , walking quickly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he climbed , and then carrying the carbine free in his right hand to lengthen his stride . He did n't even look at the tracks now , but only quickly picked out his footing ahead . If he did n't catch sight of the cat at the summit , he could pick up the trail where it had gone over . Gained on the bastard all the way , he exulted , and it 's still going up . It 's hurt . It wants to rest . No rest , you black bastard , he exulted . The exultation sank away as he saw what he 'd been thinking all this time . Not black , he corrected himself . It only looked black that far away and against snow. /He was troubled , nonetheless , by a swift , superstitious passage of the black flight , andy half a notion that this cat was n't even the one he had started o track ; that this one was black , and was leading him , with a purpose like a man 's , a thinking enemy 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there was a moment when he wanted to stop , when something in him wanted to turn and go back down . ' " Black painter , " he said loudly and scornfully , against this impulse . " Did n't you see it jump , you son of a bitch ? It can feel lead , all right . And it 's running . It 's hurt , and it 's running . Black painter , my eye . " He went on up , now striding swiftly from rock to rock under the snow , now half running where the footing was better . From up on top , with only thin timber all around , he 'd be able to spot the cat a long way off . He might even get another shot . At any rate , no tricks were going to do it any good . From a lookout like that , he could see the whole map of the range . He could guess in one look what it was up to , whether he saw the cat or only its trail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long P259dogging . They would begin to match wits , and that was his game , not the cat 's . You 'll have to be a spook then , you bastard , he thought , exulting . Suddenly the bright snow he climbed on was darkened . The light just faded away downward , behind him , and the whole ridge came under a shadow . He glanced up , and saw the new snow mist reaching up out of the ridge like smoke . It was comingup without a break in it . The farther west he looked , the thicker and more shapeless it was . The wind felt colder under the shadow too , and heavier . It wo n't help you now , though , you black butcher , he thought savagely . It 's way up still . It wo n't snow for hours . Maybe it wo n't snow at all , he thought . Just the tail end of the storm blowing over . It ca n't snow forever , this early . Nevertheless , he felt hurried . He realized suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been out , and then it felt late under the shadow of the cloud , past the middle of the afternoon . The sun had been way west of the ridge , that was sure . The arms of the snow mist had cut it off long before they came over him . They were just coming over him now , for that matter . When he came among the last , stunted , wind-bent trees , with all their branches reaching east like tattered banners , he went up carefully , just the same , with the carbine held ready . He let himself down onto his knees against the granite backbone of the ridge , and crawled up slowly , not to appear suddenly against the sky , and at the very top crawled on his belly . If it was really so late , if there was really snow in the new darkness , it was all the more important not to miss a shot now , and not to make himself a running target by carelessness if he had a chance for a sitting one . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along that end of the ridge . There was only the long , gray stone , swept almost clean of snow by the wind , and west of him , clearly separate from here , the big range , with the snow much deeper on it , its upper fields an unbroken white , and over the big range , and west of it as far as he could see , a dark , moving sky of snow clouds . Here and there the white wall of the big range was already veiled by falling snow bent a little southward by the wind . P260He stood up then , and came onto the ridge with one of the leaning trees behind him , so he would n't show . From there he could see the whole long blade of the ridge , clear to the sky on the north , and even farther south , two or three miles , perhaps , to where a long dragging screen of snow already falling came through a pass in the big range , and , sweeping slowly up the one he stood on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ridge on the west side too , clear into heavier timber and the whitened forest on the valley floor . The cat was n't in sight anywhere , nor was there a single track that he could see anywhere in the snow below him . For a moment the cat became more than natural again . There was no cover on the ridge , and there could n't have been time for it to get down into timber below . With nothing there , with only the wind streaming over the rock ledges , and far across , only half seen as his eyes searched nearer him , the gigantic , slowly changing drama of the storm in the big range , it was as if the cat had turned the joke on him after all , andreally vanished , dissolved , become wind itself . Then he thought , It would n't go down yet . It 's deep snow down there , hard going , and a deep trail behind him . It 's gone north , the other side of the height of the ridge . Leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hood and belly it out , he went north swiftly on the good rock footing , and down toward the head of the ravine , where the cat had come up . He found the track there , already dim with blown snow , but it only led him back up onto the trackless rock . On the ridge again , he stood for a moment , looking all about quickly , and then went north once more , half running . At the skyline the granite shelved down steeply , and only a little below him the snow had banked against the ledges . There were no tracks in it . He let himself down to the edge of the snow , and then followed it around to the west and south again until he was opposite the tree he had first stood up against . The snow edge was n't broken anywhere , except by gray rock or the curving blade shapes the wind had given it . Once again , for a moment , the cat formed and was able to vanish in his mind , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then first the white snow showed faintly through it , and then the  |p261twisted  tree , and finally even the gray ledges , before it was not there at all . His waking mind , now angry and hurried , pressed the brief vision aside at once , as less than the enemy shapes a child makes for himself in a dark room . " Must have gone south , then , " he said aloud . " Nowhere else it could have gone . " With a moment of fear , half made up of the time he had already lost on the ridge , he thought , But the bastard must have plenty left to move that fast . He could n't have been hurt too bad ; not bad enough to do any good . He climbed back onto the ridge , and turned south where he met his own tracks . With the wind behind him , or quartering down over his right shoulder , so he felt it finger in now and then through the tear in the parka , he was warmer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He pushed the hood back impatiently , so he could see all around him , and traveled quickly along the crest of the ridge , watching for any place among the ledges where the cat might have crouched to hide or to wait for him , and scanning the edge of the snow on both sides . Twice he saw breaks in the stone where the cat might have hidden , and held the carbine ready , and worked up to them carefully . In the first there was a little slanting drift of snow the wind had dropped over the edge , but no mark in it . The second was sheltered by an overhang , and the stone floor was bare . Standing above it , and looking south as far as he could see , without finding any break in the snow below the ridge , he thought , The bastard waited here till I went up the north end . It has to be that . Then he could of got clear down there where it 's snowing before I got back around . He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallow cave , and stooped and looked carefully at the thin scattering of sand over the granite , and the lines of sand caught in the crevices . There was nothing that was clearly a track , but in three places there were breaks , the sand spread a little and across its natural line , as wind could n't have moved it . Could n't have been there long , either , he thought , or the wind would of straightened them out again . He watched them P262for a moment , and saw the grains stirring now , moving bit by bit , a few here , a few there , back into their lines with the wind . " It 's you , you damn spook , " he said aloud , eagerly , and straightened up quickly , and climbed back onto the ridge again , and turned south . He went at a dog-trot now , glancing along the edges quickly , and as far ahead as he could , and looking up and beyond that now and then too , worried by the snow cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the first flakes of the snow began to move across him , he said aloud , " So you made it , you lucky bastard . But it wo n't cover for you yet . " The snow thickened , though . He could n't see anything distinctlyin it , and had to go more slowly , peering to find the white edges , sometimes waiting out the heavier flurries in order to see at all . And again , as it became suddenly darker in the blown snow , time jumped away from him , all the way to the edge of evening . " Oh , you lucky devil , " he said . " But it 's not done yet , you son of a bitch , " he vowed angrily . " This goddamned ledge ca n't go all the way to Mexico . You 'll have to show some time . " Then , after all , in his anxiety , in the ever-thickening pall of the snow , he almost missed what he was looking for . It was only chance that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment , and before his eyes lost it again , he guessed what it must be . Standing there peering toward it , waiting for another break in the whirling of flakes about him , which had already whitened the parka , and now was beginning to hold on the rocks too , he felt the little fear again , the cold , slight thrill of being outwitted , as he realized that what he 'd seen was n't at all what he 'd been watching for . He 'd been watching right along the edge for the flower prints and the groove of a tail drag . These marks were far down from the edge and just holes in the snow . The wind broke the snowing open for him again , and he saw them clearly , only one group , all bunched together , and twenty feet or more below the bare granite ledge . He went down to them , partly blinded by the snow driving against his face . It was the cat , all right . In the bottom of the little pits the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers of the pads . He could n't see out of the snowing in any P263direction now . He worked on down slowly , and found another cluster of marks , and then a third , and a fourth , each many feet farther down . Then the incline lessened , and the tracks closed a little . He drew up the hood to shelter his eyes , and followed the descending clusters , forcing himself to go slowly and carefully in spite of his impatience , and his fear of the storm and the coming darkness . " You ca n't go any farther than I can in this , " he said aloud , but now less as a threat than to . encourage himself . Farther down the slope , where the wind-bent timber closed in again , the tracks became single and evenly spaced , and now and then a short crescent of tail-drag showed . The cat was sure of itself again , trusting the cover of the storm , and the bare ridge and the long leaps behind it . " Give me one look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , but continued to work his way carefully down among the trees , pausing and peering , and sometimes flaring angrily inside against the snow and all the hiding places which made him go so slowly and kept him from seeing any distance around him . It was quieter down there though . The wind passed high above him , and the snow fell gently under it , making only occasional mild eddies . Toward the bottom of the ridge , the snow grew rapidly deeper . The cat had floundered several times , leaving long , deep belly troughs , with dark holes in them where its legs had sunk . Been snowing here all day , Curt thought . On and off , anyway . And a little later he thought , And all night too . The cat marks floundered on , though , going as straight down into the valley as they could among the trees . No tricks now , he thought . Thinks it 's clean away . Just traveling . It 'll hole up by dark , and lick its scratches . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was difficult just to push through it , he stopped long enough to lace on the bear-paws . Then he went down again , clumsily , with the little side-swing of each leg the bear-paws made necessary , but even so , faster and more easily . The trail led straight across the high valley between the two P264ranges , first through a reaching peninsula of timber , and then across a wide , open meadow , where the snow was blown into sharp , curving drifts over the earth humps and along the turns of the creek that meandered south through the middle of it . The creek was frozen over and then covered with snow . By the time Curt came among trees again , on the west edge of the meadow , real darkness was spreading into the gray gloom of the snowing . The snow was the deepest yet there , and light and evenly spread . The cat had dragged badly in it , and floundered from side to side , hunting for solid footing underneath . Even in the dusk and among the trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up through the terraced pines in long , irregular switchbacks . Curt was encouraged , thinking how he gained here , going nearly straight up from point to point of the cat 's slow zigzags . He climbed as fast as he could , but it was exhausting work . The webs sank in , and a little burden of the snow had to be lifted and shaken off at each step , and often he had to dig into the white slope to keep from slipping . He was breathing quickly and loudly , and beginning to feel shaky and a little lightheaded from the steep pitch and the height , and painfully empty from his long fast . Also , as the darkness increased , he began to mistrust his eyes . The burdened trees loomed ominously all about him , and sometimes seemed to be closing in . He could n't be sure of distancesamong them . He was high enough now , too , for broken gusts of the wind to reach down to him sometimes , whirling the snow and moving the trees jerkily , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the shadowy jumping . The snow was falling more heavily all the time , and he had to give up cutting across the cat 's long detours for fear of losing the trail altogether . He 'd hardly been thinking at all for a long time now , only watching , when all at once , like a warning from outside , as sharply as if somebody had called to him , he thought , Cats can see in the dark . The thought stopped him at once , right where he was . Mountain lions can see in the dark , of course , he thought . They hunt at night all the time . He was almost as much alarmed because he had gone so long P265without thinking of this obvious fact as he was by the fact itself . His confidence was shaken again , as it had been shaken when he came onto the first ridge , and could n't see the cat or any tracks . Now it was getting to where he had to be almost within reach of a tree to pick it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind together . But the cat could see him as well as ever , if it was in the right place . The snow would blind it a little , perhaps , but hardly more than iii daylight . Again he quickly remembered stories of the malice and clevernessof mountain lions , and also what the tracks had told him at first hand about this one , doubling back and waiting above the trail for Arthur , and then gaining all that time by using the granite ridge . In the darkness , his mind made very clear pictures , too . He saw Arthur 's dead face , the way it had looked when he first turned him over . Then he saw Arthur coming up the trail under Cathedral Rock , alive , but not watching and not thinking about what he was doing either , and the cat crouched on the ledge above him , working its hind legs carefully , nervously under itself for the leap , the tip of its long , serpent tail slowly curling and uncurling . At once , after that , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on a ledge he could n't even see . After a moment , though , he made himself go on up . He had sworn to get that cat . He had repeatedly made a vow to a dead brother for whom he had wept his first tears since he was a , little kid that he would get that cat if he had to follow it all thway to the ocean . And he had said something to the little Welsh about a lion skin too . It had been a foolish boast , but he 'd made it , and when he thought of going back without the hide now , the boast became a vow more compelling than the one to Arthur , because others had heard him make it . If he stopped here , and the snow kept falling , he would n't even be able to make a guess , by morning , where the cat had gone . Ile knew this range . He knew exactly where he was on it now . If he could just keep tracking until the cat holed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trail now , and he climbed more and more slowly and guardedly . He was nearing the real timber- P266line . The trees became smaller and smaller around him . He could n't really see them , but he knew what they looked like , low and flat and one-sided , with loose fibred , twisted trunks , like sagebrush , the tough , misshapen little dwarfs of height and cold and wind and rocky rootholds . The darkness seemed to be holding off , to be giving him a little more time up in the open among them , but the wind was constant and icy , and the snow it carried pelted him like fine shot . At last he came up onto the dark rock ledges of the crest . The wind was so strong he had to stoop against it , and sometimes hold onto the rock to steady himself . It blew the snow at him like weapons , in long spear lines out of the dark northwest . He could n't see the tracks at all now , but only make out the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow . This was where he had to quit . The long rock would have to do as a startingpoint in the morning . Standing still for a moment to think about that , he felt the sweat in the hollows of his knees and running slowly from his arm pits down along his ribs , although his face and his trigger hand were numb . Also he realized for the first time how tightly he was holding the carbine , and the tiny , dancing tricks of their own his tired eyes were playing on him . When his breath was evener , he moved slowly along the edge of the dark rock , feeling with his bare hand for the tracks his eyes kept making in the snow when they were n't really there . Sometimes he got down on his hands and knees and put his face close to the snow because he could n't trust the numb hand either . He was luckier on this rock , though . He 'd started south along the edge , because he could n't see at all going north , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have made its choice the same way . He found the tracks going off the south point of the rock . He made sure of them , taking off his left mitten and trying them with the fingertips of his warmer hand . There was no question about them . Through the thin sifting of new snow , he could feel the little pattern of hollows and ridges made by the pads . You were n't far ahead , you cocky bastard , he thought , to leave them that fresh . And sure you 'd done it , too , just walking off , like taking a Sunday stroll . P267He stood up and put on his mittens , both of them now , and leaning over , bracing his back against the wind , peered south down the funnel of the streaming darkness . He could see nothing but the ghostly , slanting spears of the snow . " We 're not done yet , you murdering bastard , " he said aloud , addressing theenviab le , .. banther , his mind made , which was curled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sheltered crevice not very far south . He went slowly back down among the tough little trees . He fell several times , because it was impossible to judge the pitch and because of his trembling knees . When the trees were bigger and closer together , and the wind was more a roaring overhead than a power , he hunted , almost by touch , and with the dogged overcarefulness of exhaustion , for just the kind of tree he wanted . He hunted all in one direction , south , and he counted his steps . He had taken forty-eight deep , dragging steps which he hoped would still show in the morning , when he found the tree . It was a fir tree , tall and thick for that altitude , and it stood flat sided against a low cliff . The snow had drifted deeply below the rock , burying the tree far up . It had drifted into a firm wall too , where the wind had sucked down around the rock , a curved wall with the tree inside it . He worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main stem . Clinging there , he laid the carbine across two branches , took off his mittens and stuffed them into his pocket , and slowly , because his fingers were stiff and cold and tired , unharnessedthe bear-paws and strapped them together , and hound them to the joint of a branch . Then , pulling the hood far forwardover his face , and holding the carbine , muzzle up , against his shoulder , one hand covering the trigger guard against twigs , he let himself slowly , spirally , down through the branches onto the bed of old needles . No wind at all got down there , and no snow . The needles and twigs at the foot of the rock had only a thin powdering of snow on them . It was very good to be down there , and able to give up until daylight came again . It was as good as a homecoming after a long time away . He leaned the carbine carefully against the rock , memorizing where it was by hand . Lying there on one elbow , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of matches out of his right pocket , and took the knife out of its sheath . P268Holding them , he carefully went over in his mind the turns he had made coming down through the branches . Then he lit a match and began to scratch with the point of the knife on the rock wall beside the carbine . The rock was granite , and made a fine tinsel glittering in the light of the match . It was so hard that only a faint scratch appeared on it , no matter how he dug at it . He burned six matches while he scratched an arrow pointing north that he could really see , and eight more matches to make a little 48 above it . In the thick darkness again , he closed the match container and put it back in his pocket , and pulled the oilskin packet out of his other pocket , and unfolded it carefully on the needles betweenhim and the rock . There were six slices of bread in the packet , his fingers told him , and a roll of stripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cut off a side of bacon . Three meals at least , he thought . Maybe four . And I 'll need it more by tomorrow night than I do now . He allowed himself one slice of the bread , and three of the thin strips of jerky . There was butter on the bread , and the butter tasted wonderful . He was very grateful to Grace for putting butter on the bread . He ate the buttered bread slowly , a small bite at a time . Then he chewed the jerky even more slowly , not swallowing it until it practically ran down by itself . The chewiness of it was pleasing , and the juice it made in his mouth was very good . It was salty , though . He 'd only chewed a little of it before he was very thirsty , and realized that he 'd been thirsty for a long time . When he 'd finished the jerky , he carefully rolled up the rest of the food in the oilskin again , and pushed it well down into the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its sheath , and slid it back into the other pocket . Then he began to draw snow , a handful at a time , in from under the edge of the branches , and press it together . He worked at it patiently until he had a dripping ice ball that nearly filled his hand . He stretched out on his back , letting his body feel its weariness completely for the first time , smiling a little at its twitching , which once or twice even jerked his heels on the slick needles , and sucked the ice ball slowly down to nothing . The snow water had a faint , stinging taste of granite and dead needles , but it washed down the saltiness of the jerky , and slaked his thirst enough to let his body rest better . He wiped his hands P269dry on his pants , and reached inside the parka and got the pad of cigarette papers and the little sack of tobacco out of his shirt pocket . He had trouble rolling the cigarette by touch , and it came out nearly empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between his lips by the empty end , he returned the papers and tobacco to his shirt pocket , and got out one match , and put the match container back too . Then he lit the cigarette , defendingthe flame of the match with both hands , although there was not a breath of air to move it , and carefully pinched the match out , and lay back again , drawing slowly and deeply on the cigarette . Its glow made a surprising amount of light in the closed darkness . The shining points of the granite appeared faintly at each drag , and he could see every needle of the bough above him . He blew the smoke out against the base of the rock , and held the cigarette there too , when he was n't drawing on it . The smoke thinned out to nothing before it rose very far along the granite . He was sure that not the least whiff of it could get all the way up through the tree and the snow . He considered that carefully . He was so tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail of each act he performed . When the cigarette burned his thumb , he extinguished the limp butt of it against the rock , put on his mittens , rolled onto his side , with his back in the shallow cave at the base of the cliff , and drew his knees up into the long shirt of the parka . Lying so , he pillowed his head on one arm , and almost at once fell deeply asleep . He was kneeling beside a small fire , with his hands held close over it . He was trying to warm himself , and at the same time trying hard to remember something . It disturbed him greatly that he could not remember , because he was alone in the middle of a darkness in which not a single star or mountain shape could be seen . He was lost , and he believed that what he could n't remember had to do with where he was , or with some danger which threatened him there . Then he saw that he was n't alone . Arthur was standing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at him . It comforted him enormously , after the first start of fear at seeing him so unexpectedly , to have Arthur there too . " It 's Joe Sam . You know that , do n't you ? " Arthur said . Curt did n't understand this remark , but he knew it was important . Arthur spoke loudly for him , and very seriously , even urgently , as if he intended the remark to be a warning . Curt looked at him intently , trying to understand what he meant , and then he was no longer comforted by his presence . There was something bad the matter with Arthur . His eyes were n't open at all . Curt had mistaken the blue , shadowy lids in the deep sockets for open eyes looking at him . Also , his face was too hollow and still , and there were four long , deep scratches across it , diagonally from the left temple to his mouth , and his beard was full of twigs and clots of earth and yellow willow leaves . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Where is the wooden Indian ? " He had n't intended to ask any such foolish question . Joe Sam was n't wooden . " No , " Arthur said . " I killed him . I had to , " and opened his eyes . They were enormous and frightened . He stared down at Curt , and said , " Years ago , " and held out his hands for Curt to look at , as if that would explain what he meant . Curt saw that his hands were red to the wrists , and that the red was fresh , and dripped between his fingers . " It was the painter , " Arthur said unhappily . That 's it , Curt thought . The painter 's wooden , and that 's just paint on his hands too . " Do n't say that , Curt , " Arthur cried , so suddenly , and in such a terrified voice , that Curt leapt up . Then he was alone , and in complete darkness . Even the little fire was gone . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all alone , and closed in against him , and thick . But he knew what the danger was now . It was himself , not Arthur , the panther was going to kill . Arthur had somehow escaped after all , but he , Curt , was lying down there against the fir tree , under the boulder , and the black panther was waiting for him on the snow above . It could n't get down to him , but it knew he was there , and it knew he 'd have to come out sooner or later . It was going to wait for him . He could hear it sniffing up there , at the edge of the snow around the tree . Then , all at once , he was greatly relieved .   " Not black , the son-of-a-bitch , " he said aloud , and rememberedeverything clearly . He lit a match just the same , and felt much better to see the fir bough over him , and the carbine leaning against the rock , and the arrow and the 48 scratched beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glow of the cigarette the night before . To see the whole little hollow just as it had been , completely separated the dream from what had really happened . He still could n't entirely free himself of the feeling that the cat was waiting for him above , but he knew better than to believe it . There was n't a sound up there , when he really listened , and besides , the snow would n't hold the bastard up . " I 'll really put something in the old belly this morning , " he said aloud . " I 'll have to chase the son-of-a-bitch again , God knows how far . " He stretched himself , and worked his shoulders inside the parka and his feet inside the pacs , doing everything he could in that low , narrow space , to break the cold that had hold of him , and to reduce his stale weariness . He did n't spend long at it , though . He had a feeling that it might be hours after daybreakalready , up there on top of the snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long start on him . As soon as his body felt usable again , he got out the food packet and ate two slices of the bread and butter and six of the strips of jerky . After that he packed two snowballs and sucked them down to nothing . He considered making and smoking a cigarette , thinking , Take your time and feel right ; gets there fastest in the end , but decided against it after all . Waste too much time , he thought . Got ta get up time and take a look around . He did n't admit to himself his other objection , that he did n't want to make a smell of tobacco smoke down there in his hole . He rolled the food packet up again , stuffed it into the left pocket of the parka , and took the carbine , covering the trigger with his hand again , and started slowly up through the branches . At first he began to repeat to himself , " Forty-eight steps north , " but shortly he could n't spare the breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It was much harder going up than it had been coming down . The limber branches would n't support P272him very well , and the ones above kept pressing him down , so that he had to squirm among them at each whorl to discoveran opening through which he could get up to the next level . He did n't allow himself to curse or thrash in his irritation , however , because he wanted to hear anything there was to hear , and he did n't want to make any loud sound himself , in case there should be something up there listening . When the trunk of the fir became noticeably smaller , and he began , vaguely , to see the shapes of the branches around him , he went still more slowly , and stopped after every gain to listen . He also worried a little now , about how he could get the carbine free in all that limber tangle , if he had to use it . He bumped his head on the snowshoes before he saw them , and was briefly alarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet were dangling free . Then he was alarmed because he had found them there , so far down under cover . A lot of new snow must have fallen in the night . He wondered if the tree would support him far enough up its tapering trunk to get out of the snow . He worked the webs free of their branch and slung them around his neck . I 'll be breakin ' out any time now , he thought . Got ta keep around against the rock as much as I can . Have one side of me covered anyway . He worked his way around and up through one more whorl , and then , suddenly , a shower of snow poured down on him , a lot of it falling coldly inside the hood . When it stopped falling , his head was up out of the snow , and he could see clearly . For a moment he clung there , motionless with alarm because he had been exposed so suddenly , and without time to prepare himself . There was nothing in sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terraces of snow-laden trees , and the new snow falling , but in big , quiet flakes now , coming straight down . He was relieved about time , too , for there was only a blue , very early daylight among the trees . It was impossible to get his bear-paws on in the tree , and when he reached a foot out into the bastion of snow , it broke up and fell away through the branches below him in little , whispering showers . Finally , furious after struggling against something like that , something with no weight and no solidity , P273which crumbled away at every touch , he scrambled recklessly up on the boulder side until he could get a hold on the edge of the rock , under the snow . He flailed some of the snow off the top with the stock of the carbine , and threw the carbine up , well back from the edge , and scrambled up himself , pitching forward into the snow . The short fury , and the little triumph that came with getting off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washing out the last of the closed-in dream notions , and leaving him wide awake and out free in the daylight . He crawled up safely away from the edge , knelt in the snow his body had packed , and laced on the bear-paws . Then he put on his mittens , recovered the carbine from the bottom of the deep , carbine-shaped well it had made in the snow , and brushed it off , and cradled it in his arm , and turned north . Going as straight as the trees would let him , and making his steps short , to match the tired , plowing steps he had taken the night before , he counted the forty-eight , and stopped and looked around . There were no signs of tracks . The new snow and the wind had smoothed the mountainside perfectly , save for the curving dykes around the trees . This did n't matter too much for his start , but it worried him about the chances of the cat having left any kind of a trace . His only hope was that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh trail out this morning , a trail he could get to before any wind came up , or the new snow filled it . He turned upslope , and climbed as rapidly as he could with the webs sinking a foot into the snow at every step . He could n't see far through the heavy , floating snowfall , and everything within the circle of his vision was changed by daylight and the new depth of the snow . The dwarf trees at timberline , when he came among them , were only a field of small , white domes , and some of them did n't even make domes , but had vanished completelyunder wind-flattened drifts . It was easy to tell when he reached the fish-shaped ridge , though . There was snow on it too , now , but the wind had kept it shallow , and he could kick through to the dark rock anywhere on it . He turned south and began to move faster , the shallow snow supporting him at once , and the light , steady , southeastward suck of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small , snowed-in circle by himself , though . The trees below him faded down quickly into a white blank , and when he looked out straight above them , there was only the gray-streaked curtain of falling snow . He could barely make out the constant , gray wall of shadow above him on the right , that told him that he had n't got quite to the top of the ridge the night before . He watched the snow in front of the webs attentively , until he felt sure he 'd gone well past the place where he 'd found the tracks in the evening , and after that he watched all around him , the best he could , for any remnant of a mark in the snow that the wind had n't made . It was hard , though , in that small , all white world , to keep his mind working with his eyes . The whiteness everywhere made as good a screen for his memory to work on as the darkness of night or of his shelter under the fir tree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flakes was hypnotic . He almost missed the retreat in the ledge above him because his eyes saw it inattentively through Gwen in the yellow blouse sitting across the kitchen table from him , and coffee and hash-brown potatoes and ham in front of him . He had gone several yards beyond it before his mind , changing to show him Arthur 's body in the red coat going down over the edge across the saddle , let him know for a moment what his eyes had just seen . " Geez , " he said aloud . " Now who 's dreamin ' ? " and the little fears stirred in him again . " Keep your eyes open , stupid , " he warned himself . " The bastard could of had you any time the last half hour . " And then the fears stirred once more because he realized that he had no trustworthy impression of the passage of time either . It might have been a half hour , but it might just as well have been ten minutes , or two hours . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boldly , and turned up toward the cave , watching it attentively , and holding the carbine ready . It showed at first only as a long , narrow , blue shadow in the snowing , almost at the end of his vision . As he came closer , it darkened , and he could see that it was larger than he 'd thought , because he 'd seen only the higher south end of it . The drifting snow had made a long , curving dyke in front of the north end . He could n't tell how deep the cave was , and he P275climbed at it slowly , stopping every few feet and trying to peer into the shadow behind the dyke . When he could see clear to the back of the open end , and knew it was empty , he circled a little to the south to make his final approach at an angle that would let him see in behind the drift . There was nothing in the cave . When he had made sure of this , he climbed over the drift and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sifting of sand on the stone floor , and again he believed that the sand had been disturbed as the wind could n't have disturbed it . " He was here , all right , damn him , " he said aloud and cheerfully . He laid the carbine down and took off the bear-paws , and used one of them to shovel out the snow fill and let more light into the low , sheltered , north end . Then he crept in on his belly and peered very closely at the wall and the floor , and even took off his right mitten and searched them with his hand . Finally he found it , more with his fingers than with his eyes , a little tuft of hairs caught on the rock at the back . He crawled around into the light with them , and examined them closely . They were short hairs , just the right length , and properly coarse and wiry too , but they were very dark . They could have been called black without stretching things much . The swift , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it off by grinning and speaking aloud . " Real hair , and it came off , " he said . " He 's a dark one , all right . Maybe Joe Sam brought his old friend south with him after all , but he sheds , and he bleeds , the bastard . " And , he thought , standing up and letting the little tuft of hairs go out of his fingers into the wind , After eighteen years , he must be a son , or even a grandson . Spook stock must he shrinking some these days , too . He was a good deal short of the size of a horse , that one , to get in there at all . He picked up the webs and the carbine , and scrambled back over the drift onto the open ledge , and stood there looking at the snow all around him . The swift , chittering flight went over his mind unchecked , this time , for he was thinking about what he saw . There were no tracks anywhere in the snow except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drift and circled P276the cave , crossing the overhang that made its roof , and coming back around the north end . There were no tracks anywhere , but only the wind-smooth snow . He stopped the birds this time , by saying aloud , with a little chuckle , " Must be light enough on his feet to see through , for a fact . " It was not a successful joke . " Hell , " he said , arguing boldly against the stone and the snow and the easy wind , " he just got off too early for me , that 's all . They been rubbed out . " He laced on the webs again , and took the carbine and stood up with it cradled in his arm , and peered all around , thinking , But if he waited for daylight , there has n't been much wind . It would n't cover up for him , anywhere but up here . And he did n't double back , or I 'd of met him , or seen where he went down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ten to one against it , or he 'd of done it last night . This must be about the end of his territory . So it has to be south again . " But you 're chasin ' spooks for a fact now , Bridges , " he told himself aloud . " And there 's got ta be a strict time limit to that sorta fun . Let 's see where we are . " He went carefully over the course of the hunt so far , and tried to estimate the distances roughly by the over-all time . He could n't be very sure of his guess , because his pace had changed so often , and because he was so uncertain about the time he 'd left Cathedral Rock and about what time it was now . He believed , however , that he must have come back south along the two ridges even farther than he 'd gone north on the first tack . " Hell , " he said cheerfully , " the bastard 's practically leadin ' me home . " And less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bread , and less than half the jerky . " You 're not out of this yet , brother , " he announced . " You got ta start back down somewhere , " he went on , commencing to shuffle south again , and down the ledge to keep an eye on the deeper snow below it . " And when you start down this time , " he said happily , " you 'll leave a track like a flash-flood . " Snow 's lettin ' up some too , he thought , a little later . He was seeing farther and more easily , and with the shadowy shapes of the trees and ledges to hunt among , his mind was resisting the moving whiteness better . He watched all about him , pushing the hood part way back on his head to increase the span of his vision . Nevertheless , the notion persisted in his mind , though he did n't allow it to become more than a notion , that the cat had outguessed him , that some time before daylight , so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circled back north and waited for him , and that now it was trailing him . Several times j he stopped and turned all the way around , to take a good look behind him , but there was never anything but the long spears of snow floating at him across snow . As time went on , and he did nothing but drag along at the same slow , steady pace , even the opening mountainside could not prevent the monotony from lulling him . He was still tired from yesterday 's run , and from the cold sleep . Several times he came to suddenly , and realized that he had been moving for a long time , how long he could n't guess , without really seeing anything around him . Then the little fears would stir again , though now they seemed to move less within him than at some distance behind him , and either above him , among the ledges of the summit rock , or below him , in the edge of timber . After each startled waking , he would stop and look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went on again , he would move in a shuffling , spread-legged trot for a while , to get warm and to wake himself up . The most alarming of these starts came when he woke to realize that it was n't even snowing around him any longer . The heights were still shadowy dark , and the wind was up again , so that at times the flurries of ground snow around him were thicker than the real snowing had been , but there was no new snow falling where he was . The effect was n't encouraging , however . The wind had divided the storm for a while , that was all , and the ridge he stood on was aloft and clear between two forces , with only a thin veil of gray high above it , torn lucre and there so the blue showed faintly through . On his left the lower range and the valley between the two ranges were completelyhidden by the base of a great wall of cloud , which rose until its paler , billowing top towered into the sky far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaches of cloud , like rolling  |p278smoke  , were already advancing obliquely down the slope , and behind them , though at some distance still , came the dark main body of the new storm of which they were the scouting columns . Once he had clearly seen that storm upon the west , Curt , though he continued to go south along the ridge , and to watch below him on the left , went much more quickly , often break . ing into that shuffling trot , and he watched at least as much for some opening in the cloud below him that would let him guess where he was , as he did for tracks . The break did n't come . The front storm remained trapped in the valley , only drifting southward and changing shape within itself , while the dark storm above him in the west continued to advance , though sliding mostly along the blade of the ridge , and only slowly working over it . Trotting almost constantly now , until he was panting with his hurry , and glancing up more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a place where the ridge began to slope gradually downward ahead of him . Here and there the ragged tops of dwarf trees showed through the snow again , and as he descended , they became more numerous . The wind lost its full force behind him , too , and turned gusty , so that instead of moving with his feet invisible in the long tide-rip of surface snow , he was repeatedly caught in whirling clouds of it that forced him to stand for several seconds with his head bent and his arm across his face , until they had passed on over him and were skirmishing and twisting a hundred feet in the air out over the hollow . It did n't look like a true pass he was coming down into , but only a wide , shallow depression , a scoop at the south end of the long col he had been following . If he knew the place , he did n't recognize it now , in his hurry and confusion , and under all the snow that had drifted into it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sucking darkly down into it from the west . He had never hunted this high when there was any . where near so much snow , and he could remember a lot of hollows that might have come to look like this one when they got drifted in . If it was the one he thought most likely , though , he was still way north of the ranch . He must have gone mu ( It farther north from Cathedral Rock than he 'd realized . P279He hurried on down the slope , finally no longer even pausing for the most blinding of the snow dervishes that whirled across him , but only putting his head down , and holding the hood across the right side of his face . Even so , the new snow caught him in the bottom of the hollow . Then he was forced to stop . The air darkened around him and the snow drove thickly at him , seeming to come from every direction . He meant only to wait out the first blast , but it did n't let up . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down into the hollow , he had only been thinly frosted over by snow crystals , but now , in a moment , the parka was so thickly plastered that its red patches vanished . And this is only the first of it , he thought slowly , the words coming separately and far apart in his mind . He did n't dare wait for a lull , but began to push forward , dragging the webs , bracing himself in one direction or another at every step , and half the time with his eyes nearly closed against the black whirl of the snow . He kept twisting his body away from the storm , trying to get it to ride up off him on the blade of the hood . It did n't work , though , for whenever he got set in one direction , the snow would suddenly be coming from another . The hollow seemed a mile across at least , and it was only by the slower laboring of his legs , and the need to bend forward a little to keep his balance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on the other side . As he climbed , the darkness decreased swiftly . He had worked up into the top and south edge of the shadowy advance guard , and soon he could see the tall whirlwinds of snow dancing up the slope ahead of him again . Finally the gray reach of the storm was entirely behind him and below him , pouring on down to reinforce the high cloud that was trapped in the valley . He was on a ridge still , but lower than before . He could make out the near , ghostly spires of evergreen timber in the edge of the valley cloud . The ground snow kept racing across him as he hurried south , and then , after perhaps an hour  --  it seemed a long time , anyhow  --  the first thin veils of the new front came down over him , often broken by the gale , so that at one moment he could see only faint , hardly distinguishable shapes , and the next he could see clearly a long way down or ahead . He keptP280telling himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if the main storm caught him solidly before he found a familiar way out , he could always turn straight down into the lower storm and find shelter under a tree again . At this lowest ebb of his confidence , however , when he had nearly forgotten that he had started out to hunt , he was suddenlyencouraged by an accident of the storm . The mingled ground snow and mist of the new storm , sweeping southeast across him , and very high , was rent , like the parting of gigantic theatre drapes , and in the sharp perspective distance took on through that frame , he saw a tiny movement , against the wind , and high on the white wall of a mountain or pass ahead of him . He could n't tell whether it was the wall of a mountain or of a pass , for there was only that one region of it revealed , without a top , and without an end in either direction . He did n't try to guess which it was at that moment , either . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watched for that tiny movement against the wind to come again . He believed he saw it again , too , but almost at once it vanished . That could be because of snow blowing over it where it was , though , as it had been blowing over him here . He kept peering , blinking frequently to rest his eyes , and tilting his head back to look out narrowly from under the lids , as Joe Sam had taught him to do when he had to look a long distance and for a long time . He believed that he saw the movement twice more , each time a little farther west upon the white wall . The bastard 's still running , he thought . I 've really got him going ; running hungry , and right into the storm . He 's trying to get over on the other side , clear out of his territory . He 's pretty near done , then . He must be pretty near done to be tryin ' that . He did n't , however , feel altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could n't be sure that what he had seen was the cat , or even , to tell the truth , that he had seen anything at all . Men often saw queer things at high altitudes in snow . They made them up out of nothing , with their eyes . He admitted these reasons for doubt , but the very fact that he perceived them so clearly , that he was still measuringhis chances with such calm , was encouraging in itself . HeP281did n't really believe he was just seeing things . He believed that what he had seen was the cat , still retreating before him . The feeling that he was in undirected flight himself , and with a personal and malignant doom imminent , abated within him . He was wonderfully restored , as if the discovery that the cat was still retreating from him would in some way enable him to master storm and distance too . " Right on your tail still , you son-of-a-bitch , " he said aloud , and thought , I can stretch the food another day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can even pick me off a rabbit or a buck , if he goes down far enough on the other side . The thought of fresh meat filled his mouth with saliva . It seemed to him that he could happily eat the fresh meat raw ; that it might even be ! better raw , still hot and bloody and with the strong , salty , wild ' taste in it . He might even eat the cat , if it came to that . He was already advancing again , and at the same time keepingwatch for that tiny movement into the wind on the high , white wall . " You 'll still get your blanket , you little Welsh bitch , " he said aloud , and gleefully . " And I 'll charge you for it , too ; do n't you ever think I wo n't . My own price , and no tricks . " Then the long chain dance of the wind snow came over him again , and the white wall he had been watching was closed away . He kept peering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its appearance to pick out the tiny movement again . Several times the snow dancers broke their lines before him , or sank away , subsiding along the lower slope in filial , spreading curtsies , and he saw the white wall again , the last time astonishinglycloser , so that he seemed to be approaching it with the speed and ease of a bird , but he did n't catch sight of anything moving on it again . All at once , and quite surprisingly , so completely had his attention been fixed ahead , he was enveloped again in the darkening , blinding whirl of flakes that was not ground snow . Everything else vanished . He was shut in entirely by himself in a motion like a tremendous and infinitely various noise . In an instant his optimism was gone , and not only because of his present danger . He had been taken unawares again , and not by any little , narrow advance column of the snow either , butP282by the dark main body of the enemy , which he had been watching for hours as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high , and God only knew how deep , yet it had caught him napping , blind with a little , no-account fancy of his own . After this first panic , which he endured standing still and bowed against the storm , he began to advance across the blast again . I 've got to hole up , he thought . That 's all that matters now ; hole up and wait this out . " All the same , " he muttered stubbornly , inside the hood , " I saw something , and it would n't be anything else , up this high , in a blizzard like this . The damned cat would n't be up here , even , if I had n't chased him up . And if I have to dig in , so does he . And I 'll know that wall he was on , the first good look I get at it . " He was encouraged by the fact that he was still able to argue in this way , but the argument itself was not convincing in that whirling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreasonably , that the storm and the panther were . u w in alliance against him . Shortly , also , it began to grow darker around him in a way he did n't believe was caused by an increase of the snowing . Once again time leapt ahead in him . He guessed , as soon as he noticed the change , that he must already have overrun his mark badly , that he must be way south of the ranch , as much as ten miles south , maybe . With the growth of this first impression into a belief , all the latter part of the ridge he had followed became increasingly strange in his memory . He had never , until today , seen the white regions he 'd caught glimpses of through the curtains of storm , or the shallow pass where the first skirmishers of the new snow had caught him . Before the darkness had settled much more about him , he was no longer certain , in the tangled whirling of the flakes , of any direction except up and down . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be going down steeply . The webs slipped a little sometimes , and the force of the wind was lessened , and the whirling around him was slower . He must have got switched around to the east without knowing it , and be going down between the ranges . Well , there was nothing to do but go on down , and hole up as soon as he could . Not only P283was he lost , but a new , fierce cold had come down with the second army of the snow , and even in the heavy parka , he was already shivering from it . He had to get cover , and get it quick . Since he was already south of the ranch , it was all to the good , so far as getting home was concerned . It was the end of the last pretense of keeping up the hunt , though , and what was a lot worse , it proved that his sense of direction , that infallible guide that was just in him and to be obeyed , was no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dis tance , if as much . Gradually , with the barrier of the slope behind him , it becamepossible to see a few yards into the dusk around him . He had come among twisted , timberline trees once more , but much bigger ones than those in the shallow pass , standing well up , blue and ghostly , out of the deepening snow . He felt a more wakeful hope that shelter was near , and began to increase his pace . He fell several times , but struggled and floundered to his feet again each time , and hardly gave the falls a thought . It was only a last-moment glimpse , a something he felt to be wrong , though he could n't have said what , that saved him from tumbling over the cliff . He checked himself so close to the edge of it that his left web broke off a block of snow , which vanished with startling suddenness , leaving a faint , shadowy break in the snow line , like the place where a tooth is missing . Perhaps it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sloping snow at the bottom of the ravine had appeared perfectly continuous with the slope he was coming down . Nothing had trustworthy shape or distance any longer , but only a scarcely distinguishable difference of pallor and shadow . After the first moment of shock , however , he felt much better . He was n't going down into the valley after all . He was going down into a ravine , a pass , a cut of some sort through the range . He had been going south all the time , after all . The compass of his reasoning swung back to agree with the compass of his body , which had never stopped insisting that he was going south , and he felt wonderfully relieved . It was like being joined again , without a flaw , after having been cut in half . The edge of the cliff seemed to slope downward to his left , to the east , that was , and he turned that way , climbing upslope P284a little first , to be safely above that too vague falling-off place , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger as he descended , but it seemed to him that it kept shifting also , coming at him straight from the north sometimes , and at other times from as far around as the southwest . When a slow , step-by-step testing with the webs finally told him he was off the cliff , it was so nearly dark he could no longer guess at the mountain shapes around him . It seemed to him , from what the webs told him , and from the fury of the wind , that he must have come out into an open and almost level space beyond the mouth of the pass . He wanted to keep going east , down the slope of the big range , and take shelter as soon as the trees were tall enough and deeply enough sunk in the snow , but the wind whirled about him so continuously now , enclosing him with blinding spirals of snow , that he was mortally afraid to venture any farther into the open . " Got to work back under the cliff , " he muttered in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cave or something ; get out of this goddam wind . " He turned right once more and began to shuffle ahead . He kept expecting the wind to ease off , broken by the cliff rising beside him , or to come more directly at him , funneled through from the west by the pass or the ravine , or whatever it was , but it did n't . It continued to buffet him from every side , and to whirl the snow so that sometimes it struck him unexpectedly in the face , bringing him to a halt , and sometimes there would be a dark quiet before him , while the snow struck its hundreds of tiny blows against the back of the parka . He drew the hood nearly closed over his face , leaving only a little opening to peer through , and held it that way . Gradually he began to believe that the wind was blowing more against his back than against his front , and again his inner P285compass fell into disagreement with the compass of his reason . It became an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument going on , and after a time , he turned sleepy and inattentive as well as weary . Twice he almost blundered into one of the haunting trees , unable to see it until it loomed sudden and monstrous right before him . Each time the tree became , for an instant , a leaping black panther , but each time he forced the terrible fear down again , and told himself doggedly , " Right ; go around it to the right , " speaking aloud to make himself listen , and as a challenge to the tree . The third time , he actually struck against a springy , reaching branch . He was almost knocked over , and a little bleat of dread was squeezed out of him by the contraction of his belly . He was very near to weeping from exhaustion and bafflement , when at last the wind did begin to ease off , and the snow to fall more slowly and more evenly around him . " About time , " he said angrily . " Goddamit , it 's about time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , their goblin shadows against the glimmer of the fallen snow , and though he was stopped by them several times , believing he saw them move , even lifting the carbine against them , yet each start of fear was milder than the last , and each time , before he moved on , he remembered to warn himself , " Around to the right ; keep going around to the right . " Gradually the trees became fewer and smaller and farther apart around him , until at last he seemed to have come into a region where there were no trees at all , but only the light , deep snow he shuffled through , and the thick , falling snow slanting across him . He had been worried before about losing his directionas he steered around the trees , and now , unreasonably , he was much more worried about circling in the pale emptiness . He was about to risk making a complete right turn , to go straight at the north cliff , when the falling snow was twisted by the wind , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looming up there , and the dark band of cliff under it , close ahead of him . In the moment he was allowed to stare at them , he was sure that he 'd seen that shape of whiteness before , that , from far north , in the afternoon , he had seen that tiny , dark movement across it and against the wind . The uneasyp286needles of his compasses spun wildly against each other , and he stood still , and the white slope that looked like a wall in the darkness was closed away from him again . He waited , feeling every least turn of the wind now , as something he must judge , and staring at the place where the wall had vanished . Finally there came another gust that was strong enough , and from the proper quarter , and he saw the white wall again , or enough of it to make him feel that its top might rise through the storm , and into the clear darkness and the light of stars . Until then , he had most nearly believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident that he must already have got turned either north or south , unless he was in a box canyon , instead of a pass , and this was the end of it , and that did n't seem likely , so high in the mountains , and with the storm suckingthrough the way it was . He brooded half-attentively upon the problem until his mind stirred resentfully against the waste of time . You know damn well it 's no box canyon , and north cliff or south cliff , the thing now is to get to it and find a hole of some sort in it , before you fall asleep or fall over . He began to move forward again , more quickly than before , though he did n't know it . Now that he 'd actually seen the white wall , seen something with a real direction to it , instead of just snow and trees , his inner compass steadied , but it insisted , perversely , that he was still going west , and that could n't be right . The needle of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had seen from afar , began to swing to a north behind him . He had gone to the right around each tree , but that did n't matter , because it was most likely between trees , or on this empty canyon floor beyond them , that he 'd started to circle . The way a man always turned was the way any animal would turn when it was blind lost , away from the wind . Well , he knew that the true direction of the wind , whatever the pass and the shapes of the mountains did to it , was from the northwest , but mostly north , did n't he ? And it had seemed to him that the wind was working around to come mostly from behind him , had n't it ? So , if this was a pass he was in , it was most likely the south wall of the pass he was heading for .  | The dark band of the cliff appeared before him again , and through the falling snow this time . It had been farther away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but now it was really close . It became a visible confirmation of his reasoning . His inner compass swung the quarter circle to put north behind him too , and for the first time since he 'd entered the cut , the two needles lay exactly and steadily together . This time the coincidence brought him no peace , however , for in the instant it assured him that this was the south wall looming above him , he remembered also that he 'd seen the cat on the south wall , and going the same way along it that he 'd been going along the floor of the pass . And surely it would n't have gone all the way through the pass against a blizzard like this . It must have been caught by the snow , and holed up , pretty close to where he was now . And cats could see in the dark . His fear of the cat became for the first time as constant as his fear of the storm , and almost as strong . Even as the joining of the compasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fears . He turned left under the wall , which would be east , the way he wanted to go out in the morning , and slogged along , breathing hard and shakily , and peering around him constantly , but also glancing up often at the dark band of the cliff above the steep snow that covered the talus slope . He had n't gone more than a hundred steps along the cliff , when he believed he saw what he wanted , a narrow , elliptical rift of gloom , right at the top of the snowbank . Iie went up sidewards toward it , knocking steps in the snow with the edge of his right web . When he was close enough under it to be sure that it was a cave , and not an illusion , he stopped suddenly . it came over him that the cat might be curled up in that very niche . Then he could imagine it not curled up at all , but crouched at the edge , peering down at him . The wish to weep returned upon him strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a long minute of standing there listening , he slowly took off his right mitten and stuffed it into his pocket , and moved along the snow bank toward the east end of the cave , watching the black opening unwinkingly , and holding the carbineready . Nothing stirred in there that he could be sure of . P288At the end of the cave , he faced about and climbed up until he was at the top of the slope . He squatted there , still peering into the rift , and dug into the snow beside him with his bare hand , and brought up a big piece of the fallen shale . He held it poised at arm 's length for a moment , and then hurled it into the cave , and at once brought the carbine up , with his finger on the trigger . The shale struck much sooner than he 'd expected , and made only the briefest of small , dry echoes . Nothing else happened . He threw two more pieces , one into each end of the little cave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then the silence in which nothing moved but the falling snow . He thought of reaching in with the carbine and prodding , to make completely sure , but realized at once that such a process would put him much too close , if there were really anything in there . He thought of lighting a match . The idea alarmed him . The cat probably was n't in here , and if he just crawled in , daring the darkness , it would n't even know he was in the pass . The flame of the match would show up like a railroad headlight . If the cat did n't know where he was now , it certainly would after that . Again the wish to weep swelled terribly within him . No effort of his will , however , could bring him to crawl into that cave without seeing in first . At last he got the match container out of his pocket , and took one match from it , and closed the container and returned it to the pocket . He took a deep breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeady to lift it quickly , and then , with an effort so desperate as to blind him for an instant , scratched the match at the edge of the cave , and held it in just under the corner of the roof . He more than half expected to see the two yellow eyes staring back at him like lights themselves . The match made a small , shadowy , moving light , but it was enough to show him , after a moment , that there was no cat in there , and no opening at the back big enough to let anythingthrough that mattered . It was a very low , shallow cave , almost crescent-shaped , and he could see , mostly because of the shadows they made , the three pieces of shale he 'd thrown , and the rough , down-shelving roof and back , and the litter of twigs and small bones and tiny droppings on the sand . He took only one good look , and then shook the match out and drew a deep breath of relief in the dark . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him lie down , but it was dry , and it was his , and it could be easily defended , with that steep , snowcoveredslope coming up to it . It would get him in out of the wind and the snow , too , and that was the most important thing . He peered all around below him , over the snow shimmer under the darkness , and then laid the carbine on the edge of the cave floor and crawled up and sat beside it . There he took off his other mitten , and slowly , with difficulty , unlaced the webs and laid them in together against the back of the cave . All the time he kept peering down into the populous darkness he had stirred up with the match . At last , still watching , he lay over on his elbow , with his head to the west end , and drew his legs up into the other , more tapered end , and took the carbine into his hands . Many dark shapes formed and dissolved below , but none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became indifferent to them . It no longer seemed so importantthat he had lighted a match . He must keep watch , of course , but he need n't torture himself to do it . He held the carbine then only with his left hand , and pillowed his head upon his right arm . After a little while , his eyes closed . He started up abruptly , striking his head on the low roof of the cave , but paid no attention to the blow . It seemed to him he 'd been dozing for some time , a half hour at least , exposed in his cave as upon a shelf . He glanced swiftly down over the white slope ; and then more slowly studied the darkness below it . When he had reassured himself , only wondering a little what might have climbed up out of his sight beyond die ends of the cave , he realized that there was another reason why he did n't dare sleep . He was shaking ridiculously from the cold , and there was no feeling at all in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working the hand until the pin jabs began in it , and working his toes inside the pacs too , and slowly , laboriously , considered his position . Finally he pushed back the hood , rolled out of the cave , looking quickly to each side as his head emerged , and let himself down onto the snow , and began to dig through it . He worked quickly , pulling up slabs of shale from under the snow and laying them , layer by layer , to make a front wall for the cave , and pausing frequently to peer around below him . He P290walled the lower end of the cave clear to the top , and then began to pack snow over it . He constructed a regular buttress of the snow , till finally it became like the top of the slope . Then , after thinking for a moment , he drew the carbine out through the open end and stood it against the cliff , just beyond the head of the cave , and within easy reach , and resumed his building . He was working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pausing briefly , each time he lifted a stone , to examine the moving but uncommunicative darkness of the pass . He left only a narrow opening at the head of the cave . Through this he tossed slabs of shale down toward the lower end , until he believed he had enough material inside to finish the job . He banked snow against the outside until only the opening remained dark , and then , after a last inspection of the regions below , worked into the little cave feet first , and drew the carbine in after him . At once he felt happier , less exposed and much better able to defend himself . Despite this new confidence , and his extreme weariness , however , he set to work promptly to complete the wall from the inside . The loose stone of this last portion of the defenses , without any snow packed over it , would let in all the air he needed . When every stone inside , including the three he 'd thrown in when he first came up , had been set in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top , no wider than his hand . Then , the most important matter taken care of , he entered into the condition of careful attention to detail . He felt of the snowshoes , back under the ledge , to make sure they were in place , and laid the carbine upon them . He searched back under the ledges with his hand , in order to know everything that was in there with him . He found no openings of any sort , but in one place , far under , he came upon a whole stock of twigs and small bits of dry wood and chips of stone . Must of been a pack rat in here some time , he thought . Did n't know the little bastards ever got up this high . Or do those little chitterers , chipmunks , or whatever they are , collect stuff too ? While he was still searching out the bits of wood with his hand , he remembered the litter of stuff the match had shown him on the floor , and it occurred to him , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little fire . It would give him light to eat P291by , and it would warm him up before he went to sleep . After that his body should do well enough in that small , closed space . At once he felt an even greater appetite for fire , for light and warmth , than he did for food , or even sleep . If the light was seen in the cracks of his wall , what of it ? Nothing could get at him now until he chose to come out . He scooped out the sticks and twigs , and also gathered everything he could feel on the sand under him and around him , even the little bones . Lying back against the ledges as far as he could get , he assembled all his findings into a pile between him and the front wall , and then chose from them to make a little pyramid on the sand , a miniature Indian fire . He lay still for some time , debating how to light the twigs without wasting too many matches . At last he grunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew the carbine out from behind him . He rubbed two fingers over the oily metal of the carbine , and then rubbed the oil off on a twig . When he had three oiled twigs , he laid the carbine back of him again , and fished out the matches , and lit one , and set the flame to the oiled twigs . They caught fire almost at once , even making a tiny , preliminary wisp of black smoke . He enjoyed another brief thrill of selfcongratulation . Very carefully , so as not to smother out the flame , he inserted the burning twigs and match into the base of the little cone of scraps . When the flame shrank , the beautiful light in his cell diminishing with it , he leaned his face down close to the cone and breathed gently upon it . The flame rose again inside it . It finally rose between two twigs , and danced naked , single and lovely above them , and the little cave was lighted once more . He rubbed his hands together in glee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new wall , he drew out his packet of food , unrolled it , and began to cat . He ate slowly and speculatively , his eyes dreaming upon the fire all the time , and at intervals he held his hands but to the flame , first one and then the other . He did n't allow this triumph of comfort to destroy his judgment , however . Although his stomach , after the first mouthful of food , rumbled and begged for more , at times paining him sharply , like a cramp , he ate only one slice of the bread and butter , and four strips of the jerky . While he P292was eating , he went over his directions three times like a man saying a rote prayer , in order that he should n't forget them while he slept . The third time , having reduced them to a simple and memorableformula , he spoke them softly aloud , " Turn right out of the cave , go to the end of the pass , turn left and follow the ridge half a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " While he ate and prayed , he fed the little fire now and then , from the reserve of twigs beside it . Once more the salt jerky taught him that he was thirsty . He remembered that he had n't even sucked a handful of snow since breakfast under the fir tree . He cursed himself for not having thought of this need before he finished the wall . Now he 'd have to sleep thirsty , or put out the fire and lose all his stored warmth when he opened the wall , or allow a great deal of light to show in the opening , and lose most of his heat anyway . It was a complex problem , and he lay there for some time , debating it to no conclusion . His thirst increased greatly while he thought , and finally became so insistent that it drove him to act upon a compromise plan which would also be the quickest and least troublesome solution . He drew the carbine up into the head of the cave where it could be reached from the entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quickly set them on edge before the fire , to cut off the light from the opening . Then , with one hand on the carbine , he rose to a stooping position on his knees and peered out of the slot he had made . He remained there until his eyes were used to the darkness outside , and then removed two more slabs and poked his face into the hole and studied the white slope under him and the dark and moving bottom of the pass . At last he lowered the wall still further , thrust the carbine forward , and slowly leaned out of his shelter behind its defending barrel . He was startled into swinging the carbine around , and nearly into firing , by a dark projection from the face of the cliff beside him , but he held himself , and then it had n't moved after all , and finally it became only rock . Balancing the carbine on the remaining slabs of the wall , he began to scoop up snow from below and from the side with both hands . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more P293profitable ice-ball , so he decided to make three snowballs , and melt them down when he was safely walled in again . When the three snow-balls had been made and set inside without incident , success led him on to an act of bravado . He continued to lie there on his belly on the wall making snow-balls , until he had a dozen of them piled up inside , like a pyramid of small , white cannon balls . Then , restored even more by his daring than by his success , he drew back into his hole , and brought the carbine in after him , and set the slabs of shale in place once more . Still huddled on his knees , he surveyed the repaired defenses , and spoke aloud and happily . " Now , you stinking black bastard , I could last you out a week , if I had to . " He set the snow-balls in a row around the fire , to hasten their melting . He wanted to suck and chew at one immediately , light and unpromising though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his shelter , he took pride in denying himself . It seemed a gain against all the difficulties of his situation that he should act without haste and only for the best result . " Lots of time , all the time in the world , " he told himself , and put a few more fragments of wood from his reserve into the little fire , and lay watching the snow-balls darken . The cave was very cold again , though , and his hands were wet and cold from the snow . The violent shivering , even jerking , returned , and his cheerfulness was almost extinguished . It was alarming , with a long night in the cave ahead of him still , and another whole day of hard , watchful slogging , that he should exhibit such weakness . At last it occurred to him that he would get warm much faster with his mittens on . As he reached into his pocket to draw out the second mitten , his fingertips felt something hard and edged below it . Now what the hell did I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object out . As he did so , he heard others rattling faintly below it . He held the first object down into the light of the fire . It was a little , crouching , wooden panther , not quite finished , but with the planes of the body blocked out enough to show the crouch all right , and the flat , serpent head , thrust forward in fixed attention , completed in detail . " Joe Sam 's medicine , by golly , " he said , and then , after a P294moment of consideration , " Late is right , old dreamer . " Finally he said , " Well , I 'm the one can use it now , that 's a cinch . " He set the panther up on one of the narrow ledges in the higher end of the cave , moving it about until it lay so that head and shoulders appeared in the light . It crouched there at the edge of its ledge , staring down at him , and the moving shadows gave it life and color . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscurely moved that his arrangement had taken on such on uncomfortable meaning . " The hell you say , " he told the wooden panther , and added , " And you 're the only one will ever get in here , too , believe you me . " He removed the other two carvings from the pocket of the parka , and held them down to the light as he had the panther . One was heavier and darker than the other , and the whittling only started on it . He could make nothing of it at first glance , and gave his attention to the other . It was unfinished also , not even so far along as the panther , but it had emerged from the block enough to show itself on the way to being a kneeling Indian , a thin , young-bodied man , wearing only a breech-clout , and bending over an indistinguishable victim which he had begun to skin with a tiny , rough knife , meant to be flint , perhaps . " A buck , maybe , " Curt said , studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he corrected himself . " That damned cat again . " He held the carving farther out , and viewed it whole . " Yessir , " he said , " and he 's skinning the bastard . " He chuckled softly . " The real big medicine , " he said . " The medicine to end all medicine . " And that makes you Joe Sam , do n't it ? " he asked the kneelingIndian . He chuckled again , as he surveyed the smooth , lean limbs , and the square face . " Only about ninety-seven years younger , " he said . He set the Indian up on the ledge beside the panther , and viewed them both . " Much medicine , " he said , grinning . " A regular , damn Joe Sam 's Holy Family . " He was pleased by the wit of this definition .   " Old whiskers sure could whittle , I 'll say that much , " he announced . " Only , like with everything else , " he added , " more dreaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He remembered Arthur lying on the trail after he had rolled him over , so that he was face up , with his beard thrusting ridiculous defiance at the mist of snow and light above him . He was moved nearly to tears by the recollection , and rebuked himself without words for his previous censure , and then added aloud , " Well , what was the hurry ? He had plenty of time , as far as he knew . " The thought of Arthur 's tranquil future so abruptly cut off actually brought the tears to his eyes . " Poor bastard , " he said . " Poor goddam bastard . Not a chance in the world . " His sympathy seemed about to overwhelm him , and even , possibly , to produce an uncomfortable return of his own feeling of guilt . " Just never could learn to keep his eyes open , poor devil , " he said , and was satisfied . He began to study the piece he was still holding . He turned it this way and that , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make nothing of it . There were only the first tiny , smooth cuts visible , like ripples on a wave , which slid nothing but followthe natural shape of the piece . " Hardly started , " he said . He tossed the shapeless piece upon his hand . " Heavy damn stuff . Mountain mahogany , or something . Well , old whiskers must of had some idea about you . Get up there with the rest of the family . " He set the shapeless piece into an upright crevice above the other two , and regarded the completed arrangement . " A regular blamed art gallery , " he said . " Damned if I ai n't even got a regular blamed art gallery . I got everything ; the luxuries with the comforts . " His shelter had already warmed up again a good deal . He laid the last twigs on the fire , tucked the mittens back into his pocket , and began to pack the snow-balls together with his bare hands . At last he had four dark , dripping ice-balls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the comforts . Damned if I wo n't have a smoke with my drink . " P296He wiped his hands on his pants and got out his tobacco and pad of papers . This time , with the light to work by , he made a good cigarette . He returned the makings to his shirt pocket , and rolled over and lighted the cigarette from the fire . Then he lay back and inhaled deeply , and blew the smoke out slowly , and watched it spread and disappear under the low ceiling of rock . After the third draw , he blew the smoke in a long , narrow jet toward the unsealed portion of the wall , and watched it eddy out at the top . " Snuff that , you black bastard , " he said happily . " And that 's all the good it will do you , too . " At once he felt that he had gone too far , that he had foolishly laid himself open to the malicious god . " Says you , " he added quickly . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sucking and chewing at the ice-balls . Twice he twisted over and gazed up at the three little carvings in their niches . He was pleased to have them there in his refuge . He felt a fondness for them that he had never felt for any of Arthur 's finished pieces . " Yessir , " he said , after the second look , " like a regular damn millionaire or a duke or something . Private statue collection and everything . " The cigarette lasted through two of the ice-balls , and then he dropped the butt into the fire and consumed the other two ice-balls slowly , even holding a portion of the last in his cupped hand until it melted completely , so that he was able to finish with a real sip of water . The warmth was making him drowsy again , and the memory of his bewilderment and fear down in the darkness of the canyon made his weariness pleasant . He lay there staring dreamily at the fire . It was almost down to embers by now , and he regretted this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would have made his sleep a lot more restful . " By golly , " he said suddenly and wakefully . He reached back over his head and took down the heavy , dark whittling that had only been started . " Lord only knows what you were meant to be , " he told it , " but I know what you 're going to be now . " P297He set it against the best burning side of the embers . It lay there darkly resistant , not even a wisp of smoke rising from under it . Curt took down the Indian , and used him as a scraper to heap the coals together under the dark piece . Still it would n't take . He was profoundly disturbed . It became more important than anything else in the world to him that the stubborn mahogany should catch fire . " " Stuff 's harder than coal , " he muttered . " Burn all night , if I could once get it started . " He regarded the unfinished Indian in his hand . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too finicky in a pinch , " and laid the Indian beside the formless piece . After a little , the Indian began to smoke on the inside , but it was n't lighting fast enough to suit him . The embers beneath it were dying already . " Shoot the works , " he said , and took down the panther and laid it beside the Indian , and leaning to the fire , blew cautiously between them into the embers . Smoke began to curl up around both sides of the cat . He squinted his eyes against the smoke , and continued to blow . At last a little flame leaped up between the cat and the Indian , and he transferred his blowing to the space between the Indian and the mahogany . Shortly the cat and the Indian were both wrapped in flame , but the dark piece still lay there , solid and impregnable . " Goddam stuff , " he muttered , and thought about the problemfor a moment . Then , saying , " I 'll get you this time , damn you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pushed the cat and the Indian closer together and then quickly lifted the dark piece and laid it upon them . He pushed the embers together under the three with the knife . The mahogany began to smoke . " Ah , " he said . " Now you 're talking . " He made another cigarette and lay smoking it and admiring his new fire . It made more light than the twig fire had , and gave off more heat . The low , closed cave became really warm , and his drowsiness returned upon him heavily . He dropped the second cigarette into the fire before it was even finished , rolled up the food packet and stuffed it into the crevice above his head  |p298where  the panther and the Indian had stood , and pulled up the hood of the parka . Thus prepared , he lay propped on his elbow and considered his fire once more . Despite weariness and drowsiness , he was reluctant to go as completely off guard as sleep would put him . Also , he wished to savor every moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he drew on the mittens and carefully pushed the fire together and back against the wall , and , when it was settled and burning steadily again , stretched out and pillowed his head on his left arm . He continued to watch the fire for a while , but each time he blinked , his eyes stayed closed a little longer . The fire was all right . The mahogany was burningnow too , with tiny , insecure red flames along its sides and , in one place underneath , a glow beginning , like that of burning coal . " Dandy fire , " Curt murmured . " Lucky I had ' em . " At this expression of satisfaction , something within him again made a propitiatory gesture toward Arthur . " He 'd of said so , himself , " Curt protested . " In the same fix , he 'd of burned them himself . " Nevertheless , he opened his eyes wide again , and looked at the wall of brown shale , with the firelight moving on it , and listened to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment , he felt behind him , to make sure the carbine was there , and then picked up the knife , drew it out of its sheath , and laid it handy between him and the wall . Then he closed his eyes , and began to recite softly . " Turn right out of the cave , left at the end of the pass , north half a day , right , and go till you see it , " he murmured , and repeated the incantation five times , and sighed and began to breathe deeply and slowly . There were actually two winds blowing outside . One of them was very big , and made a continual , hollow roaring high above the pass . That wind belonged to the realm of immeasurable mountain chains and the whole advancing storm , and did not , at present , concern him . The other was the little , occasional wind that came sniffing and snuffling at the chinks in the wall beside his head , and his ears continued to listen to that one a long time after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warm , brightly lighted kitchen of the ranch house ; at least the room appeared to be the ranch-house kitchen . The table , the stove and all the doors were where they should be . At the same time he was reminded of other rooms , though not entirely of any one he could remember . There were five big chandeliers hanging from the ceiling , chandeliers of the kind he had seen in the bars and hotels in Virginia City and San Francisco , made up of circular tiers of gas flames and reflectors , and all hung about with glittering crystal pendants . The walls increased the light . They were white , like the kitchen walls , and had a stairway up the north side , too , but they were made in panels instead of wide , rough-hewn boards , and they were painted with a shining lacquer instead of the powdery whitewash . The stairway was also different . It was carpeted in crimson with brass edges and had a turned mahogany rail . There was a crimson carpet with a big , leafy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that made the room quiet . In spite of these differences , however , he continued to feel that he was in the kitchen of the ranch house , and that the ranch house was standing under a timbered mountain in the south end of the Aspen Creek Valley . Part of his pleasure in being there came from the certainty that he was in the ranch-house kitchen . On the table in front of him was a thick , elliptical white platter , on which lay the bone and fat scraps remaining from a huge steak . He was still holding in his right fist the very sharp knife which had made it as easy to cut the steak as to cut butter . For that matter , the steak had been almost as tender as butter . He could still feel the way each piece had melted in his mouth , filling it with savory , hot , salty juice . There were also so many side dishes that they almost covered the table , and there was a big , silver coffee pot at his right hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in the ranch house before . The spout of the silver coffee pot was sending up a delicate tendril of steam . He was n't alone , either , and the attitude of his company encouraged him to believe that the enormous dinner would n't be the last of his pleasures that evening . The door of the north bedroom was open . The room beyondP300it was dark , and Gwen Williams was leaning against the doorframe in a pose of deliberate and interested indolence , with one hip high and her hand upon it , and the other hand playing with a locket which hung down between her breasts . She was smiling at him , and watching him with an amused curiosity which had only a small remnant in it of her former guarded withdrawal . She was wearing a gown made of the same shiny , yellow stuff as the blouse she had worn before , but it was trimmed with black lace , and it did n't cover her arms or her shoulders or the round bases of her breasts . He noticed this particularly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's or an Indian 's , was amusingly wrong , rising out of that dress , so that he felt a comfortable sense of superiority in her presence , and at the same time believed that he would benefit from the freshness of her body and the wiry independence , even slight antagonism , of her spirit . There was no one else in the ranch house with them . The place was perfectly silent , and he could feel the emptiness of the other rooms . In such freedom , the idea of a slight hostility , of chase and resistance , intrigued him . He 'd take his time about this game , make the most of the preliminaries too . Yet , in the midst of all this comfort and promise , he was n't wholly at ease . He felt that he had to play the part of being at ease , in order not to lose his useful superiority over Gwen , but at the same time he kept listening to the roaring wind outside , and for something else , perhaps inside after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might shorten his time , and even rob him of this desirable conquest . He tilted back in his chair slowly , steadily returning Gwen 's look , fencing masterfully with it , and set down the glass of liqueur which had appeared in his hand instead of the steak knife , and drew long and deliberatelyupon the cigar which was between his thumb and fingers the instant he let go of the glass , and hooked the thumb of his left hand into the arm-hole of his brocaded vest , which was exactly like the father 's . He blew out a long , slow cloud of smoke at Gwen , and continued to stare at her through it , hoping to make her look down , or in some other way be the first to lower her guard . Gwen surprised him , however , by refusing to continue the contest . It appeared to him that behind the curtain of smoke she became a much larger woman , tall even in that doorway , which was much higher than any in the ranch house . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Gwen had , too . She was still Gwen , however , with the same thick wreath of hair and brown skin and wide-apart , slanting eyes . In one way she was even more like Gwen than before . The withdrawn , P301appraising look was back full strength in her eyes , and her smile , increasingslightly behind the thinning smoke , became entirely a smile of amusement . He felt at once that in some way he had played into her hands , and his apprehensions concerning time and the sound he could n't hear became much stronger . Gwen turned and walked out of sight into the bedroom . He jumped to his feet , but then stood there , because the instant she disappeared , the bedroom became as brilliantly lighted as the kitchen . The bed , and the table and lamp by the window , were all he could see from where he stood , but they were n't the bed and lamp and table that belonged in the north bedroom . The table was an ornate , gilded one , with a marble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , glass shade , painted with roses and hung about the edge with tear-drop pendants of crystal . The bed was a vast , brass bed , as wide as it was long , and there were two big , yellow satin pillows , trimmed with black lace , propped up against the head of it . The only thing he recognized in the bedroom was the cover on the bed , and he liked that even less than the unfamiliar objects . He was afraid when he saw it . It was the rough , blue bedspread the mother was so fond of , the one with all the twisting vines and tropical birds and fruits and beasts on it , and in the center , the horse with a horn on his forehead , the one Arthur had studied over so much when he was a kid . Well , he would go in there now , and remove that bedspread first thing , and put it out of sight . The moment he decided to do that , he saw that it had already been done . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed now . Yet he was n't relieved . Instead he become suspicious as well as apprehensive . Gwen , or the big woman who was so much like Gwen , wanted to lure him into that room , and not for what he wanted , either . He did n't want to go into the bedroom at all now , yet he could n't stop himself from advancing toward it . The best he could do was to go cautiously , being careful that the floor did n't creak under his feet , and listening all the time . He had his hand on the doorframe when the light in the bedroom went out as suddenly as it had gone on . In almost the same instant , he realized that the lights were out in the kitchen too , and then he believed that the room was shrinking around him , that it meant to crush him . Also , he heard what he had been listening for under the loud wind all this time . It was a sound of heavy breathing , of sniffing . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still blowing over the roof of the house , but he could hear the breathing sound in the bedroom as if the place were perfectly quiet . Then he knew that it was n't Gwen waiting for him in the dark in there , or any P302other woman either . His fear became a paralyzing terror . He was standing in an open doorway , where he could n't see anything , and that heazy , snuffling breathing was coming closer and closer to him from the other side . He was lying perfectly still , on his side , facing the wall . He could n't see the wall in the absolute darkness which had closed in when the lights went out in the bedroom and the kitchen , but he knew it was there , so close he could have reached out and touched it . He did n't , though . He had to lie perfectly still . Not only his ears , but his entire body , was concerned with detecting every least whisper of that breathing and snuffling in the cracks of the wall . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that it had been out there for a long time already , that it had gained over him a considerable advantage of preparationwhile he 'd sat in there letting Gwen make a fool of him . Even in his present predicament , he felt extremely bitter that Gwen had betrayed him to such a terrible extent as this . He could n't afford to think about that now , though . He had to know exactly what the cat was doing outside , and the sniffing was all he had to guess by . The cave was smaller than he remembered . He had to lie with his legs drawn up , like those of a child sleeping cold , because there was n't room for him to stretch them out , and the shelving roof pressed down on his shoulder . When he imagined the cat breaking in through the loose stones in front of him , he was terrified anew because he was so tightly trapped . He felt that his position would be much improved if he could only get the carbine over in front of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contortion , and he did n't dare try . If he made the least sound for those attentive ears out there to pick up , the delicate balance of doubt that was preserving him would be broken . That cat was cleverer than any man about all the signs of fear and helplessness , and it would know at once how he was fixed . He could only lie perfectly still and curse himself inwardly for having gone to sleep with the carbine behind him . He even had to control his fretfulness about that , for he knew that if he were to let himself go only a little , he would be swept by brainless panic , and that would be even worse than trying to reach the carbine . It would give him away at once . Even if he managed to hold himself absolutely quiet , not a single muscle moving , not the faintest whimper escaping him  --  and that whimperingcould begin only too easily  --  even then the cat would know . Those busy , intelligent black nostrils could n't possibly miss the scent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would set it of even more promptly than the sound of struggle . No , there was nothing to do but lie perfectly still and concentrate upon keeping his fear imprisoned in that small , round cell in his middle where it was now huddled , waiting like a dangerousinternal ally of the enemy outside . The worst of it was that he could think of no good end to this corneredrabbitstrategy . His fire had gone out some time since ; just when , he did n't know , and the cave was getting cold . He was almost as much afraid of jerking from the cold as of jerking because the fear broke out of his middle . And time meant nothing to the panther out there , warm in its thick , black coat , and free to move about , and fascinated by the man smell it breathed in at every crack of the loose stone wall . Time was as much in its favor as position was , and that was another thought which could n't be allowed to repeat itself too often or dig in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suddenly moved by some failure in secrecy inside , rearing against the loose stones beside his head , and pushing them in . He could see , as if it were happening , the huge , fiat , whiskered head thrust into the breach , the mouth slightly open to pant , and the great yellow eyes shining at him as if there were a fire inside the cat that showed out through them . He could feel its hot breath on his face , and even smell the carnivorous reek of it . Then , all at once , he really was seeing the panther . This was n't because the wall had been broken in , though . He was terribly alarmed for an instant , because he thought the wall had vanished , and the cat could see him too . Then he realized , with great relief , that the wall was still there and that , although he had developed the ability to see through it , the cat had not . It was crouched just the other side of the wall , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It came to him only slowly , like the growth of a horror too vast to be comprehended all at once , that the beast , in order to loom up as far as it did out there , in order to stand on the top of the slope of snow and crouch down to snuff at that crack , must be enormous . All his previous notions , the lost dream of pleasure , everything , vanished from his mind at the overwhelming impression of the cat 's size and nearness . He held his breath , no longer able to trust the wall between them at all . Then he understood also , that in his complete absorption in the presence of the cat , he had overlooked another danger . Joe Sam was out there too . He was helping the cat in its hunt , and it was his mind and has unrelenting purpose which had all this time made the cat seem so humanly dangerous . P304He had come up the canyon silently from the east , from the ranch , and joined the cat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him too now , and was shaken to think that he had lain there so long , blind to the very most dangerous quality of his enemy . Joe Sam was dressed only in a breach clout , but he did not seem to notice the bitter cold at all . He had a knife in one hand , an ancient , chipped flint knife , and with the other hand , he was feeling over the un covered at-thead of the cave . The great cat lifted its head eagerly , its tongue lolling out one corner of its mouth as it panted , to watch Joe Sam 's hand trying the loose rocks . There was no question that the two were working together . The panther was only waiting for , Joe Sam to select the best slabs of the shale , and silently , one at a time , remove them until it could reach in . Joe Sam took hold of the top rock , and a queer , whimpering noise occurred in the little cave . It sounded very loud to Curt . Joe Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motionless , with his hand on the rock . The cat lowered its head again , and tightened its shoulders . Joe Sam was looking down where the cat was looking . They were both looking right at him . Curt could see the thin , wicked , restrained pleasure in Joe Sam 's face , with its narrowed eyes , one of them half lidded , and looking away dead , but the other looking right at him with its wicked joke . Then he saw that the cat had only one good eye too . The one eye was fixed upon him , and it winked very slowly without ever closing , as if the fire inside the cat rose and fell in response to some slow pulsing of its strong and unpleasant desire . The courage-breaking whimper occurred again in the cave , so that the cat settled its shoulders down further , working them a little in preparation for a leap , and Curt realized that he was making the whimper himself , and probably could n't help making it again . A sudden , tangible fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spine to spread among the roots of his hair . At the same time , he saw Joe Sam spring back , grinning , and vanish at the head of the niche , and the cat sink down still farther , till only its one burning eye was visible against the darkness of the canyon . They knew he had come to the end of bearing his confinement , and they were preparing for his break . The whimper broke out of him again , more loudly . There was a change in his situation which he could n't explain for a moment . Finally he understood that the wall had become solid again . It closed him in , almost as if it pressed upon him , and he was unable to see out into the pass at all . He could see only one thing still , the cat 's attentive , slowly blinking , single  |p305eye  . It was actually inside the little cave with him now . He raised an arm to shield himself from the expected blow , and knew that something else had changed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a cold child , with his knees drawn up , but he believed that he could stretch out if he chose to , and that there was some space between the shelving rock roof and his shoulder . It was a great relief to know that he had that much freedom of action . Never looking away from the blinking eye , holding it with his own gaze , as if he could thus keep the cat from pouncing , he began to calculate his chances . It felt good to be able to calculate them , to be able to think , to be able to make his mind test this and that possibility as he directed , after his will had been so long extinct in terror . The impulse to whimper grew weaker . He lay silent , watchful , and tense for action , while he thought . A second hopeful impulse , one that approached triumph , so little does it require once despair is broken , took place in him when his liberated mind informed him , at the joining of a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed him from so near he could have touched it , was n't an eye at all , but only a coal of his fire , in the last stages of burning itself out . He was sure , then , that he was awake , although lie could n't be sure at just what point in the events he had awakened , or what , of all that had happened , was dream and what reality . The lambent eye or coal was still there ; it had existed on both sides of a border he was unable to locate . The big dinner , the warmth , the glittering light , and the contest with Gwen , had receded to an unquestionable and regrettable unreality , but this was not true of Joe Sam and the panther , waiting outside . Ile believed that their actual presence there , particularly Joe Sam 's , was to be doubted , but at the same time a more credulous and forceful part of his being insisted that he consider them real , and act accordingly , that only a fool would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time , and thought about how to get out . There was no wind out there now ; lie was quickly sure of that . Instead there was a thick , oppressive silence of snow . His breath stopped occasionally , as he believed  |p306he  heard the soft snuffling against the stones , but it was very faint , perhaps not there at all , perhaps just vagrant movements of the canyon air . He made up his mind definitely about three things : he must wait for daylight ; he must trust to the carbine , not the knife , despite the dangerously crowded quarters ; and he must make a rush for it , prepare in complete silence , and then move all of a sudden . That was his only chance to catch the huge cat off guard , perhaps to frighten it into a momentary retreat , at least to get time for a shot , maybe even two shots , before it could jump him . There was no possible way to get out by stealth . He was enclosed , as if by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's superior senses and powers . Despite this desperate conclusion , he felt much better when he had thought the problem out to a decision . The process restored his strength and his will considerably , as if it were a kind of act itself . He settled himself , almost with a secure tactician 's enjoyment , to watch in the cracks among the stones for daylight , and to plan the rush that was forced upon him . At the same time , in order that he should n't betray himself by clumsiness when the moment came , he began to work against the cold which stiffened him now , continuously flexing and relaxing all the parts of his body he could without making a sound , his feet and the calves of his legs with them , his thighs separately , his buttocks and his belly , his chest and shoulder muscles together , his biceps , his forearms , his hands , even his neck , turning his head cautiously within the hood . It worked well enough to help . His whole body was stiff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from cold that he had trouble commencing the exercises , but as he persisted , he gained noticeablyin warmth and flexibility , and his confidence grew in proportion . The discipline interrupted his planning at times , but by jerks and single conclusions , he got ahead with it too . By the time there was surely daylight between the stones , enough of it filtering through in pale , narrow beams to let him see dimly what he was doing , his plan and his body were ready . He had even reached the point of looking forward tthe break , and had to divert a portion of his will to restrainingP307himself , so that he would n't move carelessly and give himself away . Very slowly , an inch at a time , he rolled over and got hold of the carbine , and rolled back with it . He drew off his right mitten and laid it down as if it were fragile and of great value , and felt lightly of the trigger of the carbine , to make sure it was set . He picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his teeth , in case something went wrong and he had no choice but in-fighting . Then , with the greatest care yet , taking minutes to accomplish the small change , he worked himself down into the narrower end of the cave as far as he could and still assume the position necessary to the surprise . The cat , naturally , would be giving its attention to the other end of the cave , where the smell of the man and his belongings , and the last little smoke of his fire , came out . Drawing his legs up against his chest as closely as he could , he worked himself around sideways in the cave , and lay back , hunched against the sloping roof and held the carbine aimed at the point on the wall toward which he was slowly raising his feet . In the final position , his feet directly before the portion of the wall he intended to kick out , his legs and his body coiled back like a spring before release , he lay still again , and made a last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forgotten nothing that could be of any use . He listened intently , and believed that twice he heard the faint snuffling at the unsealed end . He grinned tightly . Distinctly , and in a cheerfully encouraging tone , though only in his head , he said , All set , Bridges , and then , very quickly , Here goes . His legs shot out so that he grunted with the effort . His heels , hitting the stones through the soft pats , were bruised , and the blow jarred him all up his spine , but he did n't notice . In an instant a wide gap appeared almost soundlessly in the wall before him , and he caught a darkly framed glimpse of huge , white flakes falling softly and thickly , and through them , dimly , of the opposite wall of the canyon , astonishingly close . In the same instant that the opening appeared , and in exact accord with his plan , he drew his legs back again against his chest , bowed himself over them , rolled forward onto his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the break , with his back toward the shallow end , in order to aim toward the deep end , outside . So complete was his preparation that only the slight reservationshe had maintained as to the exact position of the panther , and a sudden and tremendous effort of will , enabled him to check his eager forefinger . There was nothing out there ; nothing at all . He could see the whole sloping buttress of snow up to the uncovered rocks , and there was nothing on it but the new , light , perfectly untracked whiteness , except , right below him , the short sliding trenches and wells made by the shale he had kicked out , and the scattering pock marks of the snow that had fallen with it . jThe absolute silence and the perfect motionlessness of everything in sight save the slowly falling snow were shocking to him , so completely had he prepared for a roaring report and a scream , and some wild , confused fury of action . He was stunned , for a moment . It was as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick blanket of white . Then it came to him , desperately , because of the delay , that he was the one who had been tricked , that they had heard and understood his every cautious movement in there , and were leaping at him from behind . He swung violently around in the aperture , striking his head and scraping one knee and one shoulder , and , with sickening clumsiness , managed to get the carbine around and aimed again . There was nothing there either , only the slow , thick , sifting down through silence of snow onto unbroken snow . Slowly he relaxed , and as he relaxed , an unthinking , still faintly incredulous dreaminess settled upon him . Finally he leaned forward and thrust his head and shoulders through the opening . He could see along that whole side of the canyon then , as far as the falling snow would let him , and there was still nothing , not even the faintest trace of a dark movement or a track on the whole tranquil , derisive whiteness . It was n't like waking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , moving slowly , with a faint , chagrined smile upon his face , and a feeling that he had been observed by a multitude while behaving like a frightened fool , he pushed more of the wall out and let himself down into the snow . He sank into it almost to P309his hips , and stood there , with the carbine cradled in his arm , staring across at the other wall , which was much too near , and then one way along the canyon , and then the other . Without knowing it , he still held the knife between his teeth . It occurred to him finally that he could n't stand there indefinitely , staring into the falling snow . He must get started for home . It would be uncomfortable to face Gwen without a panther skin , and to face Harold and Joe Sam when the cat had been black after all , and he had been compelled to run from it . But by now such considerations of.pridt had no power over him as compared with his desire to get home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough of it , to sleep warm , and to reassure his mind and steady his will with real , limited and familiar problems . The desire to get home , in fact , was the only positive force left in him . En- all other matters , the strong , unanchored logic of the cave continued more powerful than white reality . He took the first step down , and sank still deeper into the loose snow , and remembered that he had n't put on the bearpaws . At the same time he realized that he still had the knife between his teeth . He removed it , dropped it into his pocket and slowly broke his way back up to the little cave . There he drew the webs out , and sat down in the gap in the wall and laced them on . He had to take off his left mitten too , in order to do this , and so was reminded that the other mitten was still in the cave . He reached it out , feeling a little disturbed , as he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal still winking at him . As he pulled on the mittens , however , he put the namelesseye into its place in the practical scheme of things . " Even if there was something to burn , " he said aloud , " it could n't start a fire with all this snow down . " He took the carbine into the crook of his right arm , and slowly descended the steep snow bank sideways , leaving a flight P310of fluffy steps behind him . On the bottom of the pass , with his back to the cave , he hesitated again , and stood peering through the falling snow , first to his right and then to his left . There was nothing more to see than there had been from above . He resorted to his formula for salvation , only remembering it . His mind refused the effort of testing it over again , with nothing to choose between the two walls of the pass or between left or right into the one-colored wilderness of snow . " Right out of the cave , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , half a day north , turn down and keep going till you see it . He turned right , and began to drag slowly and steadily forwardalong the floor of the pass , falling almost at once into the pace his weary but experienced body believed it could maintain . " Right , then left , then right , " he summarized aloud ; " Right , left , right , " and was encouraged to have reduced his directions to something so brief and memorable . He continued to move forward slowly and steadily into the hypnotic falling of the snow , and to repeat aloud , at intervals , " Right , left , right . " Then , all at once , he realized that he was beginning to say right , left , right without it 's meaning anything at all to him , just the way a drill sergeant might count for a marching squad , and he was a little awakened by a fear that he would forget which came first , right or left . " Right comes first , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that way . " No , he thought , with a touch of panic because he was so slow to recognize this obvious objection , No , you 've already turned right . It 's just left and right , now . Just like the drill sergeant , Left , right ; left , right . But he was stirred again by the increased danger of monotony in this even simpler count . Got ta make it real , he thought . He discussed it aloud , as with a companion who must be convinced . " Call Cathedral Rock six or seven miles north of the ranch . Say some short of half a day , if I 'd done it on these damn webs . That 's close enough ; there 's no way to get this down to how many miles . Then there was about another half day to the top of that first range , only I was taking my time , and then some , P311and it was only partly north , so that 's considerable less than half a day too . Say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good clip . Then I come south a day and some extra , faster , but I side-tracked and stopped quite a bit . Call it a day south . And there you are ; it makes me only about a half a day south of the ranch now . Half a day north , just going steady , and I ought a be right about due west of the ranch . Then I got half a day left to get across to it . Call it three or four hours , anyway , " he amended , and was pleased to find his judgment sound enough to leave a margin for error . " Three or four hours good daylight , anyway , just to get across to the valley . That 's time and to spare . I might miss the ranch a little , one way or t' other , but there 'll still be plenty of time to get in before dark . Another good three or four hours . " He was elated , not only by his conclusion , but because he had arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the calculation based upon substantial memories of his route . " Mr. Mountain , Mr. Pass-I-never-saw-before , " he declaimed happily , " and you too , Mr. Goddam Blizzard-in-October , I got ' you outfigured . Thought you had me , did n't you ? Well , you ai n't . That 's where the little old brain comes in . That 's the only thing you ai n't got , and it 's gon na be enough . " And you too , Mr. son-of-a-bitchin ' black painter , " lie added ecstatically . The moment he ceased speaking , however , he was sharply reprimanded by that internal monitor who disliked prediction in vital matters , and at once he did penance aloud . " Only you 're not out of this yet , by a long shot , " he told himself , in a tone of foreboding . " And all that 's going to get you out is slow and steady and keep your eyes peeled . Do n't you get to day-dreaming too , right under some goddam rock the goddam black bastard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself against the doom of the proud , lie allowed another little burst of elation within him , but even that seemed too much like making a dare . " And do n't you go to getting all steamed up either , " he warned himself . " Left out of the pass , north half a day , right , and keep going , " he recited , and was pleased to discover that P312the directions seemed beyond any danger of becoming a drill count now . He repeated them once more , aloud , still avoiding a cadence by saying , " Left , north about three or four hours , right , " and was confident he had them for good . And if it keeps up like this , he permitted himself to think , looking up into the silent snowing , so that the nearer flakes became black , like a vast swarming of flies , against the untold depth of the white ones above them , if it keeps up like this , it 's gon na get snowed out and give me a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all this snow down , " he warned himself . " Yeah , " he replied , " but if it really opens up , so I can see J any distance at all , see just one big peak , for instance , I 'll have a pretty fair notion where I 'm at . And if I get a look at the sun , " he added . " Take it slow and easy , just the same , " the cautious self insisted . " You 're wore down plenty now , boy , plenty . Take it slow and steady . " He understood that the warning referred to the little , sudden elations as well as to weariness . " Left , right , and in , " he said . The formula began to repeat itself after all , slowly and monotonously , to the slow swinging of the bear-paws . " Left , right , in ; left , right , in ; left , right , in . " Finally he checked it by a direct , wordless effort of his slumberous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogged , unchanging pace , with a mind very nearly as blank as the world around him . The floor of the pass began to slope downward before him , ' and the white domes , of the timberline trees with here and there the dark , agonized branches breaking out through them , appeared around him and grew more numerous as he advanced . Here 's them damn spook trees again , he thought mildly , and then thought , And I 'm going down some , and experienced a faint revival of his elation because his reasoning had been sustained . The wings of the canyon mouth appeared , vast and insubstantialthrough the falling snow , their tops invisible . He felt that the trees were watching his retreat as neutrals , approving i of it as the performance of the cleverer contestant , although perhaps mocking him a little too , in the dry , silent way of old P313inhabitants , because it was a retreat . It seemed they had somehowbeen informed of his boast and of his vow . They would n't harbor the cat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow in the pass was too deep and too light . The bear-paws had become a great advantage . The cat would have to stick to the wind-swept heights and ledges now , and could he kept at a distance by the simple expedient of staying where the snow was deep . It might even be shaken off behind the screen of flakes , during one of its extended detours . It would n't do to trust to such a hope , however . He continued to feel that the cat was not far from him , and this made it impossible to believe that it was n't being guided by a sense of neighborhood at least as strong as his , and probably much stronger . It was likely , indeed , if he was able to maintain this vague but constant sensation of its presence somewhere above him , and on the left , that it knew exactly where he was all the time . This was no cause for alarm , or wasteful caution . The storm in its third day had become his ally in retreat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ally in pursuit . Only he must n't get careless or absentminded ; he must n't trust too much to its protection . He must remember to avoid overhangs of any kind , and slopes where the snow was shallow . When he came between the great wings of the canyon mouth , where the slope became wider and went down more steeply in front of him , he stopped and peered all around , and then stared for some time downslope and then , finally , straight out before him into the falling snow . He believed that he could make out the ghostly , whitened spires of big trees below , but looking straight out , he could see nothing at all hut curtain behind curtain of the falling snow . There was a choice to be made here . The alternative had occurred to him almost every time he had repeated his set directions knowingly , and now he had to choose . Slowly he brought his ponderous mind to bear upon the problem . Here he might either turn north , and go back the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crossing whatever was there , and do a good part of his distance north in the security of the Aspen Creek itself . There was something to be said each way . If he went north along the ridge again , there would be many stretches of shallow P314snow , which would allow the cat to draw nearer , and to charge if it got within range . Down below there , where the big trees had broken the wind , the snow must be very deep by now . The cat would almost certainly have to stay well above him , and follow him by wide circlings . On the other hand , he could see a reassuring distance around him up here , as long as no wind came up , fifty yards or more , while down there he 'd be shut in by the trees , and if any cliff or boulder or close line of trees did let the cat get near him , or over him , he might never even see it , and certainly he would n't see it in time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far south that he could n't trust his summer memories of what the region was like . He was probablyclear south of the lower end of the Aspen Creek Valleyby now , and it was a confusing country down there , full of f little , broken hills , all alike , and the timber thick on them . It was easy to get lost down in there , even without a blizzard . For that matter , the upper valley , between the two ranges , did n't go nearly as far south as the Aspen Creek Valley did , and the section south of it was pretty well tangled itself , ridges and canyons slanting every direction . He found that he could n't even make a general map of them in his mind , and knew that unless he had the sun to go by , he might never get out of them before dark . His margin of time was enough , if he knew where he was going , but there was n't any to spare for just running in circles . No , back by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time . Even if the storm increased instead of breaking , or the wind began to blow again , he could n't lose his general directionup there . He had only to remember to keep the downslope on his right , and he could hardly fail to do that . There 'd be no mistaking the top of the ridge if he got up too high , and there 'd be timber to stop him below . The ridge and the timber would keep him pretty near straight between them . The simple pattern of the mountains up north , just the one open meadow between the two ridges and the one lower range , would make a lot safer crossing too , one he could do in the dark , if he had to . More than that , if he stuck to the upper ridge , and the storm did thin out , he 'd stand a much better chance to spot P315landmarks even the snow could n't disguise . There was maybe a little to be said for going down to get away from the cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticking to the heights to beat the storm and the darkness . If he kept his eyes open , the balance was all for the ridge . Again he was elated by the soundness of his decision , and because it agreed with what he 'd felt all along , but this time , with the stability of a good start already made , he was able to resist voicing his triumph . He said aloud only , " Turn left , go half a day , and keep your eyes peeled . " He swung left out of the pass , climbed the gentle incline to the side of the ridge , and began to shuffle steadily forward between the gray shadow-wall of the ridge above him and the timber he could n't quite see , but knew must be below him . After a little , his mind began to repeat , in rhythm with the webs again , the only advice immediately necessary : " Keep your eyes peeled . " He had gone a good way comfortably to that count , before he realized , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping his eyes peeled at all , but rather had been entranced by the advice itself . He stopped and looked quickly up the gray shadow , and then more slowly the rest of the way around him . There was only the slow , uniform downpouring of the snow . He went ahead again , but now drove his floating mind to seek a method of preventing such lapses . Say I can see seventy-five yards , he thought . I 'd guess it 's more than that , but say seventy-five to stay on the safe side . It would take , say , five seconds for him to cover that much in this snow . It takes me , say , he thought , counting the steps he took and judging their rate , five seconds to take five steps . I 'm giving myself margin on both those counts too . " Take a look around you every five steps , " he concluded aloud , " and he ca n't catch you napping . " The counting will keep you awake , too , he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bear-paws , and to look upslope and behind him after every fifth step . He had only done this four times , however , when it occurred to him that each time he looked around that way , he left a blind spot behind the other shoulder . He began trying to look each way each time , and found that it broke his gait badly ,  |p316|practically  stopped him , in fact . It was a process more tiring and more irritating than he could afford . His body warned him that it must work smoothly and steadily if it were to finish this job at all . He settled for looking over his left shoulder after the first five steps of every ten he counted , and over his right shoulder after the second five . It was n't much help , he had to turn so far to see out of the hood . He tried it with the hood back a couple of times , but the snow on his uncovered face blinded him more than the easier turning helped . Finally it occurred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from below anyway , because the snow was too deep under the ledges and the slope so steep he did n't think the cat would try it . After that he looked only over his left shoulder , and only every ten steps , and just once in a guessed-at while , about every hundred yards , he thought , stopped and looked carefully all around . The step counting gradually became as dreamy as the repeateddirections had been . Sometimes he counted to fifteen or twenty before he realized that he had n't looked over his shoulder . Twice he forced himself back into the pattern of count-and-look and kept it up for a while , but each time it finally got away from him again . When he brought himself back the third time , it came to his mind that with no sun , and nothing but a guess to go on as to what time he 'd left the canyon , the only way he could estimate his half day north was by steps too . " Two feet to a step , " he said aloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Less , " he said . He moved forward again . " Say three thousand steps to the mile , and say fifteen miles before I turn down . That 's forty-five thousand steps . Make it forty thousand from now , for an even figure . I 've done anyway a mile already . " He began to count his steps . He had counted , with a happy sense of progress , to three thousand and nineteen , before he was touched by panic because he had forgotten to look around at all . " Geez , " he said sharply , " wake up , " and stopped , and turned completely around once , peering attentively into the falling snow . There was still nothing else moving , and he relaxed again . P317Then he believed that he 'd been able to see farther than when he 'd last looked around . He peered part way around again , and became sure of the improvement . Yessir , he thought exultantly , yessir , it 's thinning out . He began his rhythmical advance again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ god , his certainty that the snow was thinning out . He had been moving for sonic time before he remembered that he should have been counting . Then he discovered that he could n't remember where he had dropped the count . He was flooded by angry despair . " Oh , God damn this snow , " he cried aloud . The monitor pointed out at once that this burst of temper was extremely foolish . It could 've heard you a mile , it declared severely , and then added that the emotion had also cost him good strength . He could feel how it had cost him strength . His knees were even jumping a little . " Take it easy , boy , " he said aloud , but quietly , and shook his head at himself . He moved forward again , saying , " Call it another mile ; that 's close enough , " and resumed his counting . From then on , he looked around only when the monitor spoke . His progress became almost entirely the rhythmical shuffle and count . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop in him . It increased until he had to pay attention to it , and had trouble keeping his mind on the count . Still he could n't discover the cause of the uneasiness , and finally he tried to dismiss it . " Now you 've started fussing about nothing at all , " he said loudly and scornfully . " Take it easy , will you ? " The uneasiness , however , refused to be dismissed by any such casual wave of the mind . It continued to nag at him increasinglyas he shuffled and counted his way along . The moment came , some ten thousand steps later , when the uneasiness gained his complete attention , and in a manner against which he could mount no defense . It came to his eyes first , and then quickly to his mind , that there was a faint color in the light upon the fallen snow ahead of him . At first he thought exultantly , right in with his count , Breaking up sure , P318but in almost the same moment he understood that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose swiftly from the dark animal region in which he had imprisoned it , and moved about swiftly in his middle and in his mind . He dropped his counting and came to a halt on the webs . The trouble was that the light was coming down from the ridge . He looked up , and could see the sun up there on his left . It was only a small , silver disc , with a wide , confused aura of pale light about it . The high fogs of the snow blew half-formed across it , and the closer flakes swarmed blackly before it , but it was nevertheless , and beyond any question , the sun . Even then he did n't at once perceive what was wrong , but only knew that for some reason or other , the sight of the sun up there above the ridge was terrifying . It required what seemed like a long time of just standing there staring at the pale , emerging sun , for his mind to gather its forces and construct an explanation . It turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't be up there , that was all ; the sun just should n't be up there on his left . There were only two possible explanations for a sun up there on his left . Either he had slept all morning in the cave , and it was afternoon now , and time running out on him fast , or he was n't going north at all ; he was going south . The whole of the orderly schedule by which he had steadied himself fell apart . He was unable to move in any direction because of the terrible doubts which arose to confront him whicheverway he turned in his mind . He stared about him through the thinning snowfall . He could see much farther now . He could see that it was timber below him , all right ; in fact he could see far down the slope of brightening , motionless spires . And he could make out distinctly the skyline of the ridge above him . This did n't help , though ; the place was entirely strange , and it might have been on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was facing , and whether it was morning or afternoon now . He was disastrously weakened by his inability to answer either of these large , simple questions , questions which just did n't come up for a man , any more than he 'd have to stop and think which hand was his right hand . Is it morning or afternoon ? Am I facing north or south ? Who 'd ever think of P319arguing such things ? He wished to burst into tears where he stood . He endured the first movement of that helplessness which at last leads men in a blizzard to lie down and go to sleep where they are , rather than to keep struggling on , perhaps in circles , and perhaps in exactly the wrong direction . He protested against this desire to surrender . " Use your head , boy ; use your head , " he said aloud . His voice was hasty and worried , but , even so , the sound of it in that pale , silent wilderness helped . The despair receded a little . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find ; the answer to either of those big , simple questions would be the answer to both . Then he saw that he could n't guess which side of the ridge he was on , or which way he was headed , unless he knew whether that was a morning or an afternoon sun . That was the question then : What time is it ? The sun was nearly above the ridge . Say , roughly , then , very roughly , he thought , with another seizure of panic , about the same length of time one side or the other of noon . Say ten or eleven in the morning , or one or two in the afternoon . " Two or three hours difference , " he said aloud . " Not more than four , anyway . " He remembered how he had lain so carefully silent for so long in the little cave , waiting to be sure he saw daylight in the cracks of the wall before he broke out . It must have been early , then . His calculations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreat , was no longer worth considering . There was not , there never had been , he felt now , a trustworthy figure or direction in the lot . There had been too many lapses and too many blind spots , and at least one enormous , tragic error which was enough all by itself to render the rest of his laborious thinkinguseless . But loosely , in a big general way that he could depend on even now , it had been early when he broke out of the cave . Even with the darkness of snow , it could n't have been much after six o'clock at the latest . And little as he could now trust all that counting of steps , even allowing for the fact that he had n't begun to count until he was out of the pass , he could n't have been moving the seven hours it would take to make it one o'clock . He 'd have come at least twenty or twenty-five miles in seven hours , and he certainly had n't come that far .   " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's still morning . It 's got ta be morning , goddam you . " The monitor at once added the awful corollary . You 've been heading south all morning , then . The morning 's nearly gone , and you 've got all that to make up . You 've already used up your half a day , and you 'll need another half just to get back to where you started from . The compass of his body was spinning wildly by now , but the compass of his mind , as if locked where it was , still insisted that north was ahead of him . " How the hell could I be ? " he asked aloud . Once he dragged his attention from the whirling needle , it became evident that there was only one possible answer to that question too . He had n't got turned south , in the dark , among the spook trees in the pass , he 'd got turned north . He believed he knew now just how it had happened too . He 'd kept feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted to get under the north wall , and he 'd been stubbornly working against that happening all the time . So the cave had been in the north wall after all , not in the south , and that meant he 'd come out of the west end of the pass , not the east . So he 'd been going south on the west side of the range all this time . It was that simple . One mistake , and everything he 'd done for hours had been exactly wrong . Still he could n't bring himself to believe it . He 'd seen the cat moving , small as a fly , across the south wall at a time when there was n't a chance that he 'd mixed his directions yet , and with all the power of the night behind him , he remained convincedit had been the south wall he 'd seen looming before him when the snow drapes parted in the dark . " Only it could n't of been , " he complained . " By God , you ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitor promptly called his attention again to the bodily weakness which accompanied such despair , and spoke sternly against it . " You got ta do something , and you got ta do it now , " he declared . " You ca n't just stand here and let time run out on you . You ca n't last another night and have anything left to go on . Your damn knees are caving in now . " P321At the thought of a third night in the mountains , he thought also of the oilskin packet of food , and was invaded by another doubt which brought panic with it . He felt in his left pocket . It was empty . He hurriedly shifted the carbine to his left arm and pulled off his right mitten and felt in the right pocket . The knife was there , though without its sheath , which produced another but very minor shock , and the extra cartridges were there under it , and the match container , but there was no food packet . He remembered , then , quite distinctly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken the Indian and the panther out of to burn them . To save him , he could n't remember having taken it down again . No , and he had n't eaten this morning either . That was part of what ailed him right now , of course , this fuzzy thinking and easy scaring . And the packet was still back there in that niche in the cave . " Oh , Jesus , " he cried , despairing as much because he 'd forgottenthe packet as because he did n't have it . The fact that the food packet was still back there in the cave , however , made a decision possible despite the conflict of the compasses . " Got ta have food , " he declared . " Damn little chance I 'll make it home tonight , with all that time down the flume . I got ta have , something to eat . " It occurred to him that he might even have to spend another night in the same cave . The idea was repulsive beyond all reason , yet the cave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Like layin ' myself in my own coffin , " he lamented , the only refuge his memory could produce out of the whole two days of white emptiness that alternately stretched and shrank like a concertina . He turned and started back along the soft furrow of his own track . The pale sunlight then cast his own shadow faintly and downhill before him . He had gone only a few steps when his eyes began to watch the shadow sliding along there , and then suddenly his mind saw it too . The sun 's behind me , he thought . It 's October , and the sun 's way south already in October . So it 's south behind me . " Geez , " he cried softly and wildly , " do n't I know nothing no more ? " P322The needle of his mind settled and the needle of his body turned and lay with it , and the two pointed north unquestionablyahead of him . He did n't feel much better for their agreement , though . There was no doubt now about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence , already so often tried and shaken , was nearly extinguishedwhen he remembered himself standing back there , arguing so elaborately with the sun , while all the time it was shining right in his face with the only answer he needed . The self-doubts crowded upon him in great numbers , whispering all the time , and many of the little fears mingled with them unrecognized . Before he had gone a hundred steps , he was shuffling along at a half-run and breathing quickly through his mouth . He had practically forgotten the panther , so much closer were his other enemies pressing him , time and distance and the entrancing snow . The storm had thinned away everywhere over the mountains into a final , passive settling out of flakes . Now the wind began to move among them , making long , sweeping rents in many places , through which the light reached the snowy trees below , and even , here and there , the steep snow fields of the next range to the west . The snow fields turned back the light with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except by squinting and peering briefly through the shadowy flickering of his lashes . He did n't try to look very often . If there was anything to be learned from that range , it would n't be until he could see whole peaks and ridges at once . His own plowed track in the snow was all he needed for now . Just watching it , he was enough aware of the increasing light around him to be encouragedtoo . If the storm had really given up , even time and darkness might be outwitted . He was careful not to declare to P323himself , even silently , that the storm had given up . It was always " if " it had given up . Gradually the wind drew together out of its first faint gustiness , and blew against him all the time . It was a very cold wind , and sometimes it stung his face inside the hood with crystals of snow , but it felt good anyway . It seemed to give him more air to breathe , and the stitch in his side , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin away again . He did n't even notice so much the alarming weakness in his knees , or the cramped emptiness of his stomach . He began to feel that he might  --  the mentor would not allow him to put it more boldly  --  that he might make up all the time he had lost . The last mists of the snow were breaking and thinning out faster , too , as the wind increased . The brilliant light was coming through everywhere . Finally it lay single and blinding upon the slope of the ridge above him , and sprang at him in golden arrows from every angle of the mountains , so that he had to squint just to watch the trail ahead of him . He slowed down occasionally to get his breath and steady his knees , and then he would try to rest his eyes by looking up into the deep blue of the sky that was showing through in many places . Even that did n't always help , though , for often rising planes of light from the snow fields angled across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waving and folding of a snow veil in the wind would make it glitter , high in the air there , almost as painfully as the mountain slopes . Even so , the light remained encouraging . The lengthening , widening vistas released his mind as well as his eyes . He felt a little airy-headed , even really dizzy at times , as if the light and the wind were making him drunk , but it was a pleasing drunkenness , a kind of champagne elation . Still the fear of time remained nagging faintly within his growing hope . It was that small nagging which made him keep looking west , as the world opened up , to see if he could locate himself yet . He never could . Even when he was able , finally , to see clear to the western skyline , over one wave beyond another of dazzling , angular whiteness , it might as well have been the winter roof of Asia he was looking across . The first whispering doubts , and the little fears that had come out again to joinP324them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there came moments when a single , active , quickly moving fear ran out through him , escaped from the small , dark core in his middle . The monitor set it off each time , by suggesting that perhaps none of his calculations had been even close to right , that perhapsthe lapses into inattention had been much longer than he believed , and that first eagerness and then fear had made him travel much faster than he thought he was traveling . Maybe , the monitor would keep suggesting , you 're way to hell and gone west and south , in mountains you 've never even seen before . Maybe , it would say , you might just as well be looking across the winter roof of Asia , for all the good it 's ever going to do you . These spells of fear were short and well separated , though . Most of the time he was hopeful . When he had the food packet again , and was out the other end of the pass , and going north on the east slope , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'll be able to see then , insisted the monitor 's optimistic antagonist . You 'll see something you know for sure from there , it said again , almost gaily . Even if it gets dark on you now , it added , a couple of minutes later , there 'll be stars out . They ca n't get you tangled with stars out ; you can keep right on going all night , if you have to . He continued to plow rapidly north , slowing to rest now and then , but always resuming the hurried shuffle again as soon as his knees and his lungs would permit , and always peering ahead , or across at the gleaming sea of mountains in the west , through the little , protective clouds of his lashes . Gradually the monitor began to speak up , if at all , only to suggest his confidence was approaching insolence again . He was getting so warm that , in spite of the light , he pushed the hood back to let the wind work on his head . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , and across his face from the left as much as he could and still see . He had come around a sharply drifted buttress of the mountain , and the wind was suddenly much stronger against him , and much colder , and full of a twisting , glittering scud ofP325ground-snow . It blinded him , for the moment he was pulling the hood up , and he stopped until it slacked off and he could see again . Then his growing confidence received its first serious setback . The wide , crooked wake of the bear-paws , which he 'd been trusting all this time to the point of not even giving it a thought , was barely visible , and not as a distinct , broken track at all , but only as a narrow , shallow depression , as smooth as the slope on both sides of it . " Goddam , " he muttered violently . " Everything , even the goddam wind . " The spur of time struck into him deeply again . He hurried forward faster than ever along the faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until he was breathing all the time in gasps through his mouth and the champagne dizziness was constant and produced no elation whatever . Yet he did n't go fast enough . Before he was off that buttress of the range , the trace had vanished completely . There was only the smooth , trackless snow , with the glittering serpents of scud slithering up and across it at him . He let his pace slack off a little . There was no use hurrying that much any longer . What the hell , he challenged the fear . It ca n't be far to the pass now . I 've come ack most of the way , that 's a cinch . And nobody could miss a pass like that . Actually he was not at all sure that nobody , himself in particular , could miss a pass like that . He was watching the slope and the skyline above him anxiously , peering ahead along them again and again , and they were no more familiar anywhere than the shining sea of mountains in the west . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but shallow dip , with a shallow , drifted draw going up to it , he paused and studied it uncertainly . " Not deep enough , " he declared finally . " It 's no real pass . It ai n't it . " He really was n't that sure , though . The snow was deep and light , and it drifted fast in a wind like this . Also , he discovered that he was n't at all sure what the mouth of the pass had looked like in the falling snow , let alone what it would look like now . He went on after a minute , watching constantly ahead again , scanning the ridge as far north as he could see it , each time the clouds of windy crystals broke or subsided . It began to **29;3728;TOOLONG were no longer locked up in their narrow specialties but had ' been rudely forced out into the world ; they were thinking hard about politics and economics . Dr. Bates expressed ideas about the future of Germany and how mankind might prevent another cataclysm like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good map . For some reasonthe population of this part of Wurttemberg had chosen to have their towns end in " ingen " ; Reutlingen , Ergenzingen , Eutingen , Bieringen , Kietingen , Derendingen , Tubingen , Wurmlingen , Metzingen , Neckartenlingen , Neckartailfingen  --  the woods were full of them . They came to a small tributary river , . the Erms , now running , at full flood ; they turned southward , into densely wooded mountains . The stream wound and the road wound , up and up . Auf die Berge will ich steigen ! They came to the summer-resort town called Urach , with its very old Gothic church , and its two hotels on the market place , just as you would have found them in the southern part of the United States . There was the inevitable Schloss , and this you would n't have found anywhere on the North American continent , which had escaped the age of feudalism . Even before they got to the center of the town they saw that something was wrong . Groups of men were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; men came out carrying food and other articles , and at the market place there were crowds and some fighting with sticks and stones . An old , old story of war  --  pillage and rape . And here suddenly arrived two godlike personages , symbolicallyclad in power ; one tall , one short , but both in spick-and-span uniforms , gazing in stern disapproval at the tumult . This could only be the American Army , come to the rescue . Gott sei Dank ! Germans came running , Germans terrified , breathless , with staring eyes . They did n't wait to be asked , but poured out their story . " Die Arbeiter vom Lager ! Sie Sind frei ! " The foreign laborers , Russian , , Polish , and Czech , who had been brought here as semi-slaves , had broken loose and were pillaging . " Beschiitzen Sie uns , General ! " The humble townspeople were sure the strangers must be generals at least , , and might be field marshals  --  who could say ? Lanny said to his companion , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this going on . They might burn the town . " " It must he stopped , " declared the other , and ordered the petitioners , " Bring us one of the officials of your town . "  |p201They  ran off and presently came back with astoutish , middle-aged , and evidently educated man . With Germans you did n't argue or persuade ; you gave orders . Dr. Bates said , " Go pick out twenty men you know and can trust and bring them to us . " The official hurried away , and Lanny set out to find an educated Frenchman  --  for apparently the French workers had also been misbehaving . One was brought , and Lanny spoke in his language . With him , too , Americans had authority . Were they not allies and liberators of la patrie  --  two-time liberators ? And had not the great General Eisenhowerand le grand Charlie both demanded order and good behavior ? " Go find me twenty Frenchmen who have self-respect and decency . " Presently came the two squads . " Haben Sie Waft en ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had weapons hidden in the Town Hall . " Vorwarts , rnarsch ! " commanded the general , field marshal , or maybe admiral . The ex-gymnast commanded the Germans and the art expert commanded the French , and just marching and keeping step made them all a military body , disciplined and obedient to commands . Into the Town Hall and past the Goldne Saal which was the town 's pride , then upstairs and up a ladder to the attic . Guns and ammunition were passed down , just enough . " Germans will not fight Frenchmen and Frenchmen will not fight Germans , " commanded the metallurgist , as sternly as any Feldwebel . " Wir wollen Ordnung in diesem Dorf . " The son of Budd-Erling echoed , " Nous voulons de l'ordre clans cette ville . " Order in this town ! The word was magic . It went everywhere . Lanny marched one way at the head of the French , and Dr. Bates marched another way at the head of the Germans . As a rule commandswere sufficient ; one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained gymnast , and others who had stolen liquor and got drunk were ordered to the Ge fangniss . In half an hour the rioting was over  --  and two assimilated officers were in command of a German town , and , oddly enough , a French town also . The two commanders called a town meeting of the Germans and addressed them with paternal authority . This town must have a responsiblegovernment , adapted to the new conditions , and excluding all Nazis and Nazi sympathizers . The result was a clamor , and Dr. Bates was unanimously elected Biirger7neister of Urach . With stern mien he commanded that all former Nazis should be hinausgeworfen , Si and he appointed new officials who were declared to have been nonpoliticalin the evil days that were past . Lanny acquired the title of **27;3759;TOOLONG ( deputy ) , and went off to a town meeting in the compound of the easterners . Poor devils , they had been kidnaped outright or lured here by promises of fine treatment  --  promises which had been shamelessly broken . They had been in effect slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on short rations for a long time . With the help of translators the American explained that they could not be returned to their homes because no transportation was available until the war was won . In order that this might happen quickly , they must govern themselves and not make it necessary for Lanny to summon American soldiers to keep order . He appointed educated and trustworthydeputies of the various nationalities to run the camp . Next came the job of bringing all the leaders together and helpingthem to understand one another . Let all the laborers go back to work in the town 's small factories , and let food be collected and fairly divided among them . Let there be a committee to consult and decide such matters ; and let both sides pledge their good faith , so that it would not be necessary to call American troops away from their duties in order to preserve order in the Emsthal . Yes indeed , Lanny Budd was a busy man during those days that he spent in the Swabian Alps ! He had no time to visit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Goldne Saal or at the Gothic fountain in the market place . Dr. Bates soon found his scientist , and was busy interviewing him and getting the precious records locked up in the trunk of the car . Lanny discovered an anti-Nazi worker who informed him of a large cache of arms hidden in near-by farm buildings , and these were confiscated and put under guard . After that , the ex-P.A. was occupied in arbitrating and adjudicating , fixing the price of potatoes and bacon , getting multilingual proclamationsprinted , deciding whether German girls should be allowed to marry foreign laborers  --  in short , engaging in all the activities which AMG , American Military Government , would be performingin Wurttemberg for years to come . He hoped he was getting them off to a good start and not establishing too many bad precedents . Certainly he managed to please the population , for when the time for departure came they presented their deliverers with two swords which had been captured from Napoleon 's armies and had been among the town 's cherished relics for almost a century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got material of great importance , and he did n't want to take it through Stuttgart , because the French held that city , and the Americans were keeping scientific secrets for themselves . Lanny thought that French colonials would be more interested in pigs and chickens than in metallurgy ; but he assented to what the scientist thought safest . They headed west , toward the Rhine , and when they came into Strasbourg they turned the papers over to the Alsos people there , with instructions to ship them at once by air to the OSRD  --  Office of Scientific Research and Development  --  in Washington . In this town they encountered a so-called T-force of Alsos , under the command of Colonel Boris Pash , the capable officer who had charge of guiding and guarding scientists . The force consisted of two armored cars , a dozen or so jeeps , and several covered trucks with supplies . It would not plunge in haphazardly as the Bates-Budd force had done , but would proceed with military caution , telephoning ahead to each town and village to demand its surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so later ; Sam Goudsmit , who enjoyeda sense of humor , said this was n't to protect them from bombs and shells , but to make sure the Nazis did n't get a chance to wring atomic secrets out of them . The ultimate destination of this T-force was Munich , and Lanny Budd could think of half a dozen reasons for wishing to travel there . Next to Berlin , Munich was Germany 's greatest art center ; also it was close to Berchtesgaden , and to Dachau , and to that Alpine Redoubtabout which G-2 had been getting so many secret reports . Lanny wanted to see that show if it came off , so he bade good-by to Dr. Bates and waited for the Goudsmit party to come along . He had taken a shine to this Jewish professor and was welcomed cordially . They could make room for an extra man and one suitcase , and they promised him an interesting time . They were heading back into that " ingen " country from which he had just come , their destinationbeing a town called Hechingen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heisenberg had his secret atomic laboratory . Goudsmitwas sure he had n't got very far with his project , but whatever it was the orders were to go in and get it . On the way they told him what had been happening in Europe while he had been Deputy Burgermeister of Urach . Russian troops had reached the center of Berlin and were fighting to capture Gestapo headquarters . British planes had dropped six-ton bombs on the Berghof , Hitler 's Berchtesgaden chalet  --  no doubt on the chance that he might have fled there . British troops had reached the River Po in Italy . Most interesting of all , Heinrich Himmler had made an offer to surrender Germany to the Western Allies alone  --  which offer the AIlies were ignoring . VE Day could n't be very far off ! They turned off at another of the swift streams which flow down into the Neckar . This one was the Starzel ; tall , steep mountains on both sides , and a winding road suffering from lack of upkeep  --  like everything else in Germany now . Hechingen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toll-takers  --  that dynasty which had got control , first of Prussia and then of the Fatherland , and had led both to their doom . No trouble this time ! When you had a real T-force with armored cars the population of the town came out waving bedsheets on poles . There was no delay in finding the Heisenberg laboratory ; part of it was in one wing of a textile plant and another part in an old brewery . Several miles away was a small underground cave containing the uranium pile . The Army had got to the cave and removed all the apparatus and blown it up . No more scientific hocus-pocus there ! The great Heisenberg had skipped the town , or , rather , had rolled out of it on a bicycle . He had left half a dozen of his colleagues , includingOtto Hahn , the discoverer of uranium fission ; also that Professorvon Weizsacker , the Prussian aristocrat who had lent his servicesto the Nazis and had skipped out of Strasbourg before Alsos had got there . Another of the group was Professor Plotzen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Berlin . Posing as a friend and secret agent of Hitler , Lanny had gone to spend an evening at Plotzen 's home , and there to his consternation had discovered BernhardtMonck , who had managed to get a job as the wealthy gentleman'sbutler and was having his papers secretly photographed at night . So Alsos did not fail in its promise to provide the art expert with an interesting time . He spent hours with this worldly and genial physicist , who was a member of the Herrenklub as well as of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society . Did he accept Lanny 's story that he had remained a friend of Germany until Himmler had tried to draw himp205into a conspiracy to get rid of Hitler ? The story was no longer so fantastic , since all the world had been told over the radio that the Reichsminister and head of SS and Gestapo had deserted his Fuhrer in an effort to save his own skin . What Plotzen said was , all that was water over the dam ; what he was interested in was trying to save scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run off to hide in the Alpine Redoubt , because that stronghold would n't be able to hold out more than a week or two . Plotzen did n't mind saying that this famed colleague  --  of whom he was perhaps somewhat jealous  --  had gone to join his family at their summer home in the town of Urfeld , on the Walchensee , south of Munich . Confidentially he was willing to tell his friend Budd where Heisenberg had had the materials of the laboratoryburied . The cache was dug up : a ton and a half of uranium , a ton and a half of heavy water , and ten tons of carbon . The first item was of tremendous value and would be transported to a secret place in New Mexico as quickly as it could be loaded into a flying boxcar . The heavy water had been produced at great expense in Rjukan , Norway , a place whose name Lanny had obtained a couple of years ago at the expense of a great deal of his nervous energy . At first Goudsmit had thought he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt seized him  --  there was n't enough about Heisenberg 's own atomic experiments . Plotzen vowed that he did n't know anything about secret papers , and it was quite possible that Heisenberg had n't trusted him . One of the other physicists was persuaded over to the American side and revealed the curious fact that the documents had been sealed in a large can and buried in the latrine of the outhouse used by the scientists . The GI Joes did n't relish the job of rescuing that treasure and showed their sentiments by depositing the can under the open window of the room where Professor Goudsmit spent the night . In the morning it was cleaned and opened up , and there were the real secrets . They were sealed again and taken to Heidelberg to be shipped to Washington . Thousands of such treasures were pouring into that center , and thousands of scientists of all specialties were waiting to study them and decide if any immediate use could be made of them . The half-dozen German scientists were put into cars and taken to Heidelberg for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisted of living in a steam-heated villa and having long technical conversations with their former colleagues  --  American , British , and French.  |p206Colonel  Pash proposed to head a small task force to dash into the Alpine Redoubt and grab the much-wanted Werner Heisenberg . They would avoid Munich , which had not yet fallen but might be falling at this very hour . Lanny saw in this the quickest way to get where he wanted to be , so he offered to go along , and the military officer , who had been diverted by the story of Lanny at Urach , replied , " Sure thing ! " They were taking only two cars and half a dozen well-armed men , including a young lieutenant named Hayes . They would be crowded if they captured their man , but Lanny said he would n't object to having Germany 's greatest physicist sitting on his knees . Photographs in Heisenberg 's office showed an amiable and not too large person with somewhat unruly hair . Lanny had captured the Swabian town of Urach , and now he was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ur " means aged , having to do with one 's remote ancestors ; it is a differencebetween America and Europe that on the old continent the most delightful summer resorts may have buildings and history going back five or six or more centuries . In many valleys along the northern Alpine slopes are lovely little blue lakes , and Munich is fortunate in having a score of them within easy reach . There could n't have been a pleasanter motor trip ; only two or three shots were fired at them , and they might have taken great numbers of prisoners if they had n't had more important work in hand . They traveled fast , not stopping for anything . They cut up into the foothills to avoid Munich . They had passed not far from Dachau , but had no way of knowing what had happened or might be happeningthere . Americans had found it difficult to believe the atrocity stories , but now that they were liberating one after another of these packed concentration camps they were horrified by the conditions they found . They raced into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lake three or four miles long , at the head of that River Isar which flows through Munich , and down whose clear green waters Lanny had once been floated on a great raft , in company with a score of Nazi Bonzen , a picnic party with baskets of Leberwurst sandwiches and a cask of beer . That had been in the days of " Munich "  --  in thep207special sense of the name which history will always remember . Lanny had motored through this pleasureland , enjoying the good life which fate had assigned to him . Now he and his party came with no little trepidation , not sure what kind of welcome they would get . The war was coming to its anticipated end , but many men were still dying every day , and nobody could guess in what remote valleys the fanatics of the Redoubt might be hiding , or through what forests the " werewolves " might be sneaking . The ancient German legend of men who sometimes turned into wolves at night was deeply rooted and was now being used to inspire terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hooded Ku-Kluxers had done in the American South after the Civil War . The little T-force had no trouble in locating their quarry . He was a dignified gentleman , very conscious of his scientific standing . He had , of course , no idea what progress the Americans had been making in the esoteric field of atomic fission ; he took it for granted that what he knew must be far ahead of what anybody else in the world knew  --  it had been that way in so many branches of science . The news that they had been to Hechingen and had found his uranium and his heavy water and his can full of atomic secrets must have seemed to him like the invasion of ancient Rome by the barbarians from the northern forests . When he was told that he would have to accompany the task force to Heidelberg where his colleagues were interned , he yielded politely , since there was nothing else he could do . While preparations for departure were under way an amusing incidenttook place . Two high SS officers presented themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it did not occur to them that the Americans might have come without an adequateforce . The SS men stated that they had six hundred troops up in the mountains ; the snow was deep and they had little food , and , recognizing that the war was over , they desired to surrender . Very gravely Colonel Pash agreed to accept the surrender and specified the spot at which the Germans were to present themselves . At this moment the young lieutenant happened in . Perhaps he failed to grasp the situation , or perhaps he was one of those persons whose wits do not work quickly . He blurted out , " But we are only seven men ! " Colonel Pash answered quietly , " Our troops will be here in an hour or two , and that is before these gentlemen can get back . " He sent the enemy officers away , and the tiny T-force hightailed it out of Urfeld to find a larger American force and send it up there.  | As he promised , Lanny took Germany 's greatest physicist on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lanny did n't say who he was or that he had been coached on the subject of atomic fission by ProfessorEinstein . He just remarked that he had had the privilege of knowingProfessor Plotzen for some time , and had called several times upon Professor Salzmann at the Physics Laboratory of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin . That caused Heisenberg to open up and say that he took little stock in the talk about the possibility of an atomic bomb , but that there existed a real possibility of the development of atomic power for use in industry ; he had been working on this problem , and now that peace seemed near he would be glad to give the world the benefit of the knowledge he had acquired . Lanny said that was the attitude he had been sure a true scientist would take . Colonel Pash listened and must have smiled quietly to himself , for he knew more about what was going on at Oak Ridge , Tennessee , and at Hanford , Washington , than had ever been confided to a presidentialagent . LEARNING that Munich had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Heidelberg but left the T-force and made his way into the city . This shrine of Nazism was full of memories for him  --  but he had to travel some distance into it before he could be sure where he was . The heart of the city , a circle about a mile and a half in diameter , was a mass of rubble , hurled out into the streets and blocking them . All the factory districts had been bombed out of existence , also the railroadyards . There had been an attempt at revolution , and the SS troops had been attacked front and rear ; so the city had held out only one day , but the Nazis had succeeded in blowing up most of the bridges in their retreat . Nearly half the population had fled , and the rest were in such confusion as Lanny had never seen before.  |p209It  was the Seventh Army which had taken the city , having come down from Nurnberg on a broad front in about ten days . Meantime the Third had reached the tip of Czechoslovakia . Presumably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had swung south to the Danube and deep into Austria . At all hazards the Americans meant to possess that Alpine Redoubt , and block the enemy 's plans to fortify it . To hold any city requires only a few troops , and the rest would go on , looking for the enemy 's armed forces . That would include six hundredSS men holed up in a snow-filled valley above the Walchensee . This time the six hundred would n't ride into the valley of death , but into a valley of K-rations and warm stoves . There was so much news in Munich that an assimilated colonel , cominginto headquarters of Seventh , could hardly assimilate it . The Hamburgradio blared with solemn fanfare the tidings that on the previous day Adolf Hitler had died in battle for the Fatherland . The crooked little Doktor , Josef Goebbels , had poisoned himself , but his spirit lived on in the solemn official lie . It was several days before the world learned the truth , that the Fuhrer of the Germans had shot himself in the head in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Admiral Doenitz had been appointed his successor  --  but nobody that Lanny met seemed to care about that , since there was going to be nothing left for any German to succeed to . The Allies were n't dealing with governments , but only with troops that wished either to fight or to surrender . The Russians had broken through the defenses of Berlin and their artillery had been tearing the New Chancellery to pieces when the Fuhrer had at last made up his tortured mind that his cause was lost . Soldiers had no time to stop and think about him , but an art expert did . Lanny had been taken down into that Fuhrerbunker during an American air raid , and had sat on an overstuffed sofa feeling the earth shake around him but knowing that he was safe under a twenty-foot covering of concrete and steel . An entire house built underground , an office and a hospital , all with every convenience , a heating plant , a lighting plant , an air-conditioning plant , a telephone switchboard , a radio sending and receiving set  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its many-front war from that safe retreat . He would make his foes take Germany foot by foot  --  and they had done just that , and in another day would have been standing over his head and smoking him out like a rat in its hole.  |p210Wonderful  , wonderful , and after that out of all hoping !  --  Benito Mussolinilikewise had been removed from the scene of history . Il Duce of the Italians had been conducting a sort of mock government in the northern part of his country , under the protection of the German Army . When the British and the Americans closed in on him he fled toward Germany , with his latest mistress , Petacci , and a group of his henchmen . The Partisans had caught them , given them a drumhead courtmartial , then lined them up against a wall and shot them . That was n't enough to express their sentiments concerning this odious usurper ; they took the bodies of Duce and girl down to Milan , and from a scaffold in the old Piazza Loreto hung them by chains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by all the city and photographed for the rest of the world . Lanny Budd had taken that pair of dictators for his special and personalfoes ; he had called them two foxes whose brushes he wanted to hang over his mantel . How they died and what worms ate them was no matter ; the point was they could no longer torment mankind with their ignorance , their insolence , and their blind lust for power . It was Lanny 's fond dream that the whole people were wiser than any self-appointed leaders ; that if they could once get power and manage to keep it , they and the products of their toil would no longer be at the mercy of evil creatures spewed up from the cesspools of society . So long as such existed , so long as they could seize the wealth of great nations and turn them to fanaticism and aggression , they had to be fought  --  which meant that the adult life of a lover of art and music and poetry had to be turned to spying and betrayal . Exactly a quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agitator Mussolini pointed out to him in a cafe in San Remo , being cursed by one of his Socialist followers whom he had betrayed . Later Lanny had been present when Rick had interviewed him for a British newspaper . Still later the American had heard II Duce bellowing from his balcony and had tried to tell the world about his cold-blooded murderof Matteotti , the noblest personality that Italy had produced in Lanny 's time . Now the murderer was hanging by his feet in the market place , like a butchered pig ! Lanny had n't heard of Adolf Hitler quite so early , but had spent half his life in learning about that genius-madman , realizing what a menace he meant to the future , and practicing to deceive him and pick secretsp211out of his mind . It had n't been such a difficult task , for Adi had been an extraordinarily frank liar and cheat . He had put it all into a book , but few outside his own land had bothered to read it . He had adhered steadily to his theory that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed . Again and again he had said that he had no further territorial demands upon Europe ; each time he had been believed , and each time he had presented another demand within half a year or less . His opponentshad been so stupid that you were tempted to say they deserved what they got  --  if only it had n't meant such hideous suffering for tens of millions of innocent and helpless people . Now the evil pair were dead ; but not until they had caused the loss of some thirty or forty million human lives , and an amount of treasure difficult to estimate but that could n't have been less than half a million million dollars , a sum so astronomical that the figures brought no realization to the human mind . How many lives and how many dollarswould it take to remove the next set of dictators from the world ? And where was the statesman who was going to supervise that job ? Was it Winston Churchill , immovable arch-Tory , thinking about nothing but the protection of his " Empah " over all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Gaulle , trained militarist keen for his calling and Catholic zealot proud of his superstition ? Or was it the kind and modest little man in the White House , who knew Independence , Missouri , and liked to play poker and the piano , but who knew little more than the average high-school student about the manners and immorals , the greeds and insanities , of the old continent of Europe ? Lanny stayed in Munich because he knew that Alsos was on the way and that Monuments would n't be far behind ; meantime he could scout around and get information for them both . Most of his acquaintances were Nazi leaders who had fled or were in hiding ; the Americans were throwing them into jail as fast as they could be caught . This was a convenientplace to interview them , because they were badly scared , expectingthe mistreatment which they themselves had meted out to captives during twelve glorious years . Most of them were men of no principles , thinking only to save their skins ; they knew that the jig was up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It made one a little sick to hear them protest that they had never been " real " Nazis but only employees obliged to obey orders.  | Knowing headquarters of both Third and Seventh Armies , Lanny had no trouble in getting a billet and a meal ticket , and permission to go where he pleased . He asked some help from the Seventh on an emergencyjob ; there was a University of Munich , and it had a Physics Department . He got a T-force , consisting of himself and three GIs with a car . Having learned the technique , he took it upon himself to drive up to what was left of the group of damaged buildings on the Ludwigstrasse . Everybody bowed low before American authority . There had been no academic freedom in Germany for a dozen years ; from janitors to president they had all trod the goosestep and heiled Hitler . Now they would all hell Eisenhower . The president , a Doktor Walther Wiist , was also professor of Sanskrit and Persian , and director of Scholarship in the Ahnenerbe , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collecting and cherishing knowledge about the ancient Germanic tribes , the forefathers of the " Aryan " world . It was with the administrative head of the University that Colonel Budd had his dealings . This gentleman was SS Colonel Wolfram Sievers , an especially ardent Nazi enthusiast and propagandist . He counted it a rare good fortune that his name began and ended with S , since this providedhim with a unique opportunity to demonstrate his loyalty to his Aryan heritage . The insigne of the SS , worn as their shoulder patch , looked like a pair of parallel lightning strokes , and the outside world in its ignorance had taken it for granted that these strokes symbolized a military threat ; but no , they were the ancient Runic form of the letter S , and so Colonel Sievers of the Schutzstaffel signed his name this way : iever 1 . This learned university administrator was obsequious to a conquering officer of co-equal rank and offered to introduce him to the heads of his various departments , which included Genealogy , the Origin of Proper Names , Family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Folklore , and Welteislehre  --  which meant the important Nazi discovery that the inner core of all the planets and all the stars consisted of ice . Among the correspondence which Professor Goudsmit turned up in this institution of learning was a letter from Colonel ( 1 iever 4 to an official lady named Piffl , instructing her to send a representative to Jutland immediately  --  this in the very midst of a two-front war  --  because Reichsftihrer Himmler had heard a report that there was an old woman living in the village of Ribe who had knowledge of " the knittingmethods of the Vikings . " Lanny did n't want knowledge of the Vikings or yet of the inner core of the planets and the stars . He wanted to be taken at once to thep213Physics Department , and there he wanted to collect and impound all papers and records of whatever character . This was a task of some magnitude , and both janitors and professors were pressed into service . The documents were all stacked in one room , and the door locked , and a day-and-night guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival of the Jewish-Dutch-American discoverer of the " spin of the electron "  --  something in which real Nazi physicists of course did not believe . Having done this important job , Lanny ventured to ask another favor of Seventh headquarters ; he wanted them to let him have one of their PFCs named Freddi Robin for a week to act as his bodyguard and generalhandyman . One Joe being the same as any other to this busy Army , they were willing to cut the red tape and give Doc Budd an order , a jeep , and driver for a quick run to Rosenheim , where the Jewish boy 's unit was now  --  but of course nobody could be sure how many momentsit would stay there . The Seventh was on its way down through the Brenner Pass  --  they being the fifty-eighth conquering force to travel that route during recorded history . They could cut off the retreat of the Germans in Italy and bring them to a quick surrender . So Doc had another holiday drive , with a chauffeur who told him about the delights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with some of the enemy fighting like devils and others standing by the roadside holding up their hands and waving any sort of white rag they could get . The war was fun at that stage ; but Jesus Christ , what a lot of misery it had meant in the winter time , driving the Huns back against the Rhine ! Private Jack Forrester had had enough of it to last him for a lifetime , and all he wanted was to get back to Abilene , Texas , where there was a girl waiting for him . From first to last Lanny did n't meet a single " dough " who had any thought about solvingthe problems of Europe ; what was worrying them was that there might n't be enough jobs back home to go round , and the guys who got there first would get the pick . " How soon do you think they 'll start shipping us back , Doc ? " Lanny 's appearance in the town of Rosenheim was truly like a miracle to young Freddi . He had joined up at Saarbucken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rhineland and South Germany . He had by-passed Dachau and Munich  --  nobody had had time to listen to his plea that he might as well count prisoners in a concentration camp . Now he was going to be with his friend Lanny Budd , whom he adored as the greatest man in the Army , not even excepting General Ike . Lanny had a magic piece of paper which did the business in a minute or two , and it took the boy not much longer to stuff his belongings into his kitbag and throw it into the back seat of the jeep . Away they went , not stopping for even a glimpse of the swift-flowing Inn River , along which Lanny had driven with Laurel Creston , getting out of Germany with Hitler 's permission on the day the war broke out . Then the road had been crowded with German troops going to the front , and now it was crowded with Americans doing the same  --  but a differentfront ! Lanny was n't going to Dachau just on young Freddi 's account . Freddi 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help him . Lanny was interested in helping the living , by ending one war and makinganother impossible . He knew that Dachau had been the first of the concentration camps , Hitler 's own . Here he had sent his special enemies , those who threatened his regime  --  beginning on the 30th of January 1933 , the day that he took power , and continuing for exactly a hundred and forty-seven months , up to the 3oth of April 1945 , the day that he put a bullet into his disordered brain . In Dachau he had assembled his most skilled torturers , to wring secrets out of the prisoners and to render them incapable of acting , or even of thinking , against his regime . Here he had assigned his most fanatical zealots , to inflict in the name of experimental science the most hideous sufferings upon these unfortunatewretches ; freezing them , baking them , injecting drugs and poisonsinto them , depriving them of food , of water , of sleep , and keeping exact records of how much they could endure and how they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of experiments . In this enormous prison pen , several miles in circumference , had been confined the flower of Germany 's political and social idealism : those leaders who had been guiding the toiling masses and those younger men who had been trained at the labor school which Lanny and the elder Freddi had helped to keep going in Berlin . It was possible that he might find Ludi Schultz , husband of Trudi , the woman whom Lanny had married after he had been told that Ludi was dead . It was conceivable that the Nazis might have immured one of their most hated foes for twelve years and never permitted the outside world to hear a word from him . It was even conceivable that Trudi might be here ! Rudolf Hess had had the records looked up and reported that she had died in Dachau . But then , there were probably as many Trudi Schultzes in.  |p215Germany  as there are Mary Smiths in America , and suppose Hess had got the wrong one ? There were not only German Social Democrats in Dachau , there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends of mankind . Their crimes had been such as listening to foreign broadcasts or speaking disrespectfully of the Regierung . There were more than a thousand Catholic priests , and perhaps as many Protestantpastors , accused of practicing their religion . And not merely Germans , but Frenchmen and Dutchmen and Norwegians and Czechs and Danes , and perhaps some British and Americans ; all the finest spirits of the world who had got caught in Adi Schicklgruber 's death trap . Lanny was moved not merely by friendship and friendly curiosity ; he hoped to get a mass of information from these different kinds of people , and from the records of this enormous Lager . The inmates could put their fingers on the guilty and defend the innocent , inside and outside the camp . They could tell where treasures were hidden , and paper secrets more precious than treasure . Those who had enough life in them were the persons who would redeem the soul of Germany and guide its future . G-2 of Army would be there , busily asking questions about war criminals ; but Lanny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask them . He might help not merely Alsos and Monuments , but also AMG and the government of Germans by Germans which AMG was already setting up in conquered territory . Dachau lies some ten miles to the northwest of Munich , and there is a railroad but it was n't working . Lanny got a Daimler car which one of the Nazi Bonzen had left behind , presumably because he could n't get gas ; it was odd to hear how these masters of the Thousand-Year Reich had hitched horses , oxen , cows , and even Poles and Russians to their rubber-tired chariots in order to get their corpulent selves hauled away toward the east . They fled from General Patch 's Seventh Army , only to run into Georgie Patton 's Third , headed hell-for-leather into Austria . And believe it , those were real man-sized armies ! Patton alone had more than three hundred and fifty thousand men . Before setting out on this journey the two investigators had had to have typhus shots , and have their hair and clothing well dusted with DDT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the camp , and a visitor could not touch anyone or sit in a chair or lean against a wall without getting lice on him . The inmates could not have been turned loose without spreading the plague all over Germany ; they would be kept under quarantine until they were safe to move . Doc Budd was urged against going , but he was a special sort of Intelligence man , and if he felt it was his duty no one would forbid it . Dachauerstrasse from Munich had shell holes , and was crowded with displaced persons and military traffic ; bridges were down , and you detouredinto small streams . It was Army etiquette for the private soldier to drive the car ; but Lanny would n't trust his young friend , who was so excited that he could n't keep his hands from shaking . " Chillon ! Thy prison is a holy place , " the poet Byron had written , and so this sensitiveJewish lad felt about the place to which he was bound . If he could manage to find the building where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it for traces of writing . " May none those marks efface ! For they appeal from tyranny to God . " Lanny remembered the gates , and the wide street inside , lined with tall administration buildings . To keep his Thousand-Year Reich safe , Hitler would need thousand-year prisons and cages for his opponents ; he had known that and planned with German thoroughness . The officersin charge must be comfortable ; they must have well-built homes with all modern conveniences , crystal and silver and linen , books and radios and music , all elegance and all culture for the Herrenvolk , those whom the Creator had chosen to rule the inferior races of the earth . These homes must be situated in beautiful gardens remote from all scenes of horror . In the course of his visit Lanny was escorted into one of these by the American officer who had that day moved in and had barely had time to look around . A bit crude by American taste but pleasant ; on the centertable lay a volume , and Lanny picked it up ; Goethe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept back to his early youth when he had discovered the young Goethe of the lyric days , a godlike being , singing of all things lovely and noble in human life ; im Ganzen , Guten , Wahren resolut zu leben ! Then Lanny noticed the reading lamp , with a shade of a peculiar sort , a tissue like parchment , yellowish in color and ornamented with crude designs in red and blue  --  German eagles , flags , heraldic coats of arms , mermaids , quite a collection . " What is that ? " he asked , and the answer was , " Somebody had a bright idea ; that is tattooed human skin . " " Good God ! " exclaimed the visitor . " Do you suppose they killed people to get it ? " " We have n't made sure about that , " was the answer . " Maybe theyp217just made note of men who had good tattooings and waited for them to die . In this place they were dying at the rate of two every hour . " " You should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer at the gates . " If you want to know what death is , go see it and smell it . " So the visitors went outside and around to the north , where the train stood on a siding . What had happened was that at Buchenwald , a camp near Weimar , to the north , the Americans had been drawing near and the Nazis apparently had the idea that things were going to be safer in the south . They had loaded some four thousand of their Russian and Polish slave laborers into a long freight train  --  thirty-nine cars , said the officer , more than a hundred men to the car . But the railroad had been bombed , and of course military traffic had the right of way ; the journey to Dachau took twenty-one days , and it was early April , with cold and rain , and most of the cars were open flatcars , " gondolas " as they are called in America . Half the prisoners perished on the way , and most of the rest in the few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possible to view the whole train . Lanny and Freddi looked into the uncovered cars and through the open doors of the boxcars , and saw the ghastliest sights of their lives : rows and piles of human bodies , many naked , others covered with rags and bits of filthy blanket , lying as they had fallen , because they could no longer stand or sit ; a few out in the fields where they had been shot trying to escape . Many of the naked bodies bore the marks of whips . There is a familiar phrase , " mere skin and bones . " It is an accurate phrase , for in starvation the body does not give up easily , but protects itself by drawing all the substance out of the muscles and putting it into heart and lungs and blood vessels . These creatures who had once been men were now skeletons covered with skin ; their bowels had shrunk to nothing , and the skin of the belly lay against the backbone ; their eyes had sunk into the sockets , and their skulls were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet odor that threatened to set you to vomiting . There was no getting away from this odor in Dachau . The whole vast Lager was pervaded by it , and it drifted out into the countryside , paying no heed to barbed and electrified wire . It was like the smell of the Chicago stockyards , except that these bodies had n't all been cooked . The visitors went into some of the barracks , where the narrow hunks were in tiers , and discovered that many of the inmates had reached that stage of exhaustion where they could not move anything but their eyes ; they had lost the power to assimilate food and lay waiting for merciful death . They lay in their own excrement , and so there was a new kind of stench . When they died they were placed in stacks exactly like cordwood , until they could be carted to the crematory ; there they were stacked again , for crematories were overcrowded and fuel was getting scarce . The American Army had too many things to do in conquered Germanyand still needed its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order the townspeople of Dachau to bury the bodies that were in the freight cars , so they informed Lanny . It was interesting to note that the town 's five thousand people appearedwell fed and sturdy . There was no lack of food in rural Germany ; the starvation policy had been deliberate and followed from the beginning . The non-working prisoners had received one slice of bread and one dipper of thin soup twice a day ; this amounted to about five hundred calories , about one-fourth of what it takes to maintain the weight of an average person at rest . From first to last there had been a hundred and twenty-five thousand captives in this hellhole , and about half of there had died of starvation and disease . It was a sunshiny day , and all the inmates who could move were out enjoying the warmth . The liberation had occurred two days ago , but the pitiful creatures had not yet got over their excitement ; the sight of American visitors filled them with emotions beyond control . They came running or tottering , weeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be sure they were real ; they wanted to clutch them with clawlike hands ; they wanted to kiss them with unshaven faces , and to press stinking and verminous clothing against them ; they wanted to thank them in Serbian and Russian , Italian and French , Norwegian , Polish , and even Hindustani . There was an immense open compound , big enough for a parade ground , with a high wooden wall . It was crowded with men , and was really dangerous to go into . A cheer started and ran all over the place ; a mob came crowding , pouring out their thanks , questions , requests . They wanted cigarettes , liquor , food  --  they had been fed , but of course not as much as they wanted , or they would have killed themselves . Thirty-two thousand men in this place , and nothing could be done for them individually ; they had to be treated en masse . But they were indi/viduals , with their individual hopes and fears , worries and needs ; they wanted news of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to write letters , to send messages ; they wanted to tell their stories ; they wanted just to have a contact with the wonderful free world , to know that it existed , to touch some fragment of it . They had all been lousy and stinking for so long that they had forgotten how this would affect normal men . The visitors got out of the compound ; no use trying to carry on conversationthere . They walked through the narrow lanes between the low barracks , and here living skeletons , too weak to get to the compound , sat or lay against the walls and made feeble efforts to greet the visitors , a sickly grin and a lifting of the hand perhaps six inches , perhaps a foot . Their faces all looked alike and aged . Here and there lay a different sort of body , normal in size and vigorous , but dead ; they were clad in black uniforms with the SS insignia . These were the guards of the camp , and until three days ago they had lorded it over their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims were required to stand at attention , hats in hand , if they had hats , and never closer than six feet . If anyone failed in this ceremonial he was seized , his hands bound behind his back , and hung to a wall hook by the cord ; there he stayed for one hour . On the Sunday when the Americans came the mob rose and killed every one of their tormentors they could lay hands on . In the frenzy of the first minutes men had torn themselves on barbed wire , breaking through it , and some had been killed by electrified wire , or just by the violence of their excitement . The GIs had never seen anything like this ; they had heard stories but had n't believed them . Now they wanted to tell the world , and they started on one buddy and one " Doc " ; ask them one question , and they would pour out a flood of horror and rage . Look in this barrack where the Poles had been herded , the poor devils who had been hated worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into , and five feet wide ; five men had slept in each bunk , and a lot of them were still in there , dead . Or this place where a group of Jewish women had been herded three weeks ago ; things here that could not be put into print . A noncom on duty at the crematory undertook to escort the visitors through that large brick building . There was a big " office , " where the victims had been stripped , there was a gas room where they died , and there were two large furnaces where they were turned into ashes , excellentfor spreading on German fields . There was a punishment room where they were hung on hooks and whipped , and this had thoughtfullybeen arranged so that while they were hanging they could seep220bodies being thrown into the furnaces . In the early days of this concentration camp Lanny had been shown through it , or so he had been told ; but he had n't seen any of these sights , only the barracks in which the important prisoners lived . All such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; eight thousand had been taken in a huge caravan , and no one had any idea where they had gone . All the records of the Lager had been burned in the crematory . Later on Lanny found that some records had been secretly kept by some of the prisoner doctors , but these related only to medical matters , the number of prisoners who had died and what they had died of . The doctors were from all the nations of Europe , and were among the most intelligent of the men Lanny met ; they had done the best they could with few instruments and almost no drugs . They had been given enough food so that they could work  --  they and the male nurses , who also had to practice medicine to the best of their ability . They talked about the alleged medical experiments which Nazi doctorshad been carrying on in the camp , under government orders . The son of Budd-Erling had been told about these at Karinhall , by one of the " scientists " who had planned the work . Eleven thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to test various cures which did n't succeed . With the idea of helping Nazi airmen who parachutedinto the North Sea or the Baltic , the Luftwaffe had sought to discover how long a man could survive in freezing water and how he could best be revived . To make sure , they had a tank here at Dachau , whose temperature could be lowered at will , and prisoners were immersedfor exact times and careful records kept ; these records were burned , but copies were found later at Luftwaffe headquarters . They were grotesquely thorough ; among the methods of revival was putting the victim in bed with a young woman ; the records of " Section H " showed " rewarming by one woman , " " rewarming by two women , " and " rewarming by women after coitus . " Six hundred victims had died in spite of such rewarming . Dr. Rascher , who conducted these unique experiments , had requested that he be transferred to Auschwitz , because it was colder there and " patients " could be frozen in the open ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while being frozen . " Lanny and his young friend spent two days and three nights in this inferno , sleeping in one of the officers ' homes . They questioned every/body they met regarding prisoners named Freddi Robin and Ludi and Trudi Schultz , but without results . Twelve years was a long time ago , and when sixty thousand human beings have died and been burned to ashes , who can remember names ? Who even tries ? Here human beings had been deliberately deprived of personality and had become bundles of bones , to be stacked like cordwood . All the intellectual persons had been killed or taken away . Freddi went tirelessly into the compound and was passed from one Social Democrat to another , but he did not find anyone who claimed to have been in this camp from the beginning ; men did not last that long , they said . Lanny asked concerning an officer of the Wehrmacht , Oberst Oskar von Herzenberg , but nobody had heard of him . That was a long shot , of course ; Lanny had had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wild guess that he might be here . He had known about the bomb plot to kill Hitler last July . Several thousand men had been shot or hanged for that ; but it might be that others , against whom there was nothing but suspicion , had been incarcerated . It might even be that Marceline was among the few women prisoners at Dachau . Lanny met a man who had seen her dancing in a night club , but that was the nearesthe got to her . He questioned the doctors , and then the religious groups . It was hard to imagine anyone with less religion than Marceline Detaze ; but who could guess what might happen to a man or woman facing the tortures of a hell like this ? They were deliberately designed to break the human spirit ; and to what extent had they succeeded ? He discovered that the political groups had not stood the test very well ; they had some heroes and saints among them , but many others had broken and had accepted jobs to lord it over the less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slays . They had squabbled over a bit of bread or a cigarette butt  --  even though possession of the latter involved the penalty of being shut up in the " box , " a place the size of a telephone booth in which four men were locked and left for three days and nights without food or water . The religious people , it appeared , had done better . There were all sorts of clergy in this Lager : orthodox Jews , and every sect of Christians  --  Catholic , Greek Orthodox , Old Catholic , Mariavite , and a score of different Protestant creeds . They were objects of especial hatred to the Nazis and were exploited in every way . Three hundred and fifty were crowded into a single dormitory , managed by " capos , " convicted criminals who were sent here because of their dependable brutality . In winter the priests and ministers shoveled snow and removed it from the camp ; inverted dining tables were put upon long wheelbarrows to carry the snow and it was dumped into the river which flows past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith . This involved a psychological problem of interest to Lanny . How had they managed it ? Obviously , if you call yourself a materialist , you have your body and your body is all ; if it is weakened , you are weakened , and if it is destroyed , that is the end of you . You resist that happening in physical ways , but when you are caught and penned up and your foes have all the weapons , what more can you do ? You can hate them , but you realize that your hatred is impotent , and sooner or later that saps the power of your will . But how different if you believe that your body is a purely temporaryand relatively unimportant thing ! All flesh is grass , and whether it withers early or late matters not at all . When it is dead , an immortal soul escapes from its bondage and flies to heaven to have a martyr 's crown put upon its immaterial head . Meantime God is with you , the Holy Family and all the heavenly host , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goodly company of martyrs ; you pray to them , they give you spiritual strength , they enable you to defy your oppressors , to laugh at the worst that Satan can do . As your physical strength wanes , your moral strength grows . The Catholic clergy especially had the advantage in an ordeal such as this . Their religious life had been a training for it ; their traditions were full of martyrdom , and also self-punishment . Their St. Simeon Stylites of Antioch had lived his life on top of a stone pillar , a sort of old-style flagpole sitter  --  and surely a dormitory in Dachau was no less comfortable . Catholic zealots had practiced flagellation , tearing their own backs with barbed steel whips  --  it was still done in Mexico . Catholics mortifiedtheir flesh in various ways and denied its claims ; their orders practicedcelibacy , they wore unlovely and uncomfortable clothing , they went without food on occasions , and learned not to be bored by the repetition of prayers and ceremonies . When they were put in any sort of prison they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly what to do , and their new life was like their old , only more so . Lanny talked with a Father de Coninck , a Catholic priest from Belgium . His offense had been lecturing to other priests concerning the incompatibilityof Nazism with the Gospel . When he arrived at Dachau there were some twenty-five hundred Catholic priests , and now afterp223three years there were only eleven hundred , the rest having died or been killed . He had reason to believe that he was one of those destined for the gas chamber , and for two months he shared the life of the condemned . He was saved through a chain of circumstances in which , as he said to Lanny , " the protection of the Virgin was obvious . " To the non-believer , that seemed polytheism , but Lanny kept the opinion to himself . This long-enduring priest went on to explain that he had succeeded in obtaining some consecrated Hosts , meaning wafers which by the process called transubstantiation had been turned into the mystical body of Christ . He had broken these into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in cigarette papers . A dying man who confessed his sins , repented , and ate one of these crumbs in reverent ceremonyhad his sins forgiven and his soul transported to heaven . This gift was called the Viaticum  --  " provision for a journey "  --  and Father de Coninck was able to give it to many on the way to execution . They died , as he said , " with true saintliness . " To Lanny this host seemed true fetishism , but again he held his peace . What did he , man of the world and art lover , have to say to the two thousand victims of typhus locked up here in quarantine , and would he be willing to have himself locked up with them , as many of the priests had done ? He had had himself well dusted with DDT , and knew that the hard-working Army was doing the same for the whole camp as quickly as possible . If you ended war , poverty , and ignorance all over the earth , you could end typhus and all other plagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But meantime here were two thousand men , most of whom had to die , and if anybody could make them happier while dying , even by telling them a myth , by all means let it be done . So Lanny said to young Freddi , and discovered that the new generation was shocked by this idea . Let men be told the truth , even though it made them unhappy ! " But what is the truth ? " asked this modern Pilate , driving the Daimlerback to Munich . " Can you be absolutely certain that no portion of your father 's psychic being has survived ? You can say that the probabilitiesappear to be against it ; but can you say that it positively is not so ? And what was your father 's psychic being , anyhow ? "  | WHEN Lanny and Freddi got back to Munich the war with Germanywas close to its end . First the German armies in Italy surrendered ; two days later those in Holland and Northwest Germany , and next day those in Berlin . And what were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freddi wanted to know , but Lanny could n't help him much ; he did n't know that new man in the White House and had no way to find out about him . Subconsciously , perhaps , he resented having him there , as a child resents a new baby in his mother 's arms . What Lanny wanted was to get a bath and a change of underwear and to have his uniform cleaned and pressed ; it seemed to him that he stank of carrion , and he imagined that people looked at him queerly . He wanted to see something different from Dachau , and it did n't do him much good to wander about the streets of Munich and watch , ill-clad and undernourished citizens shoveling rubble into Army trucks . Burnedoutbuildings reminded him of human skulls with blackened eyesockets , and girders sticking up into the air were the bones of dead buildings . He sent the younger man back to his outfit , telling him not to be too sad over the outcome of their expedition . He had done his best , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen , Nazi-Fascism was dead in Italy and Germany . That was what the elder Freddi had given his life for , and he would surely have given it gladly . The new generation must carry on from there . Professor Goudsmit and his party arrived in Munich , and with them Jerry Pendleton . Jerry had been out with a T-force to a small town named Celle , north of Hannover , where it had been reported that the Germans had a centrifuge laboratory . They had found it in some rooms of a parachute-silk factory , and like everything else the Germans had done along the line of atomic fission , it was on a small experimental scale . They had found some important reports by Professor Walther Gerlach , a physicist whom Hitler had named as the man whom Lanny should see at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin . Now Gerlach had fled to Munich , and Jerry was to help in the hunt for him . Lanny was n't needed and decided that he would turn Monument for a while and look at something beautiful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them were alive and had not fled the bombs . His first thought was of Freiherr von Breine , Bavarian landowner and art collector from whom he had purchased a painting as a cover for his presence in Munich while working up a scheme to get the elder Freddi out of Dachau . He went walking and saw the great Deutsches Museum , a burned-out shell . He saw the Nazi Braune Haus , where he had met Hitler ; he remembered the red-leather chairs studded with bronze nails and the big bronze initials on the office door . In the entrance hall had been a marblestatue of Dietrich Eckhard , sot , drug addict , and Nazi philosopher , a large benevolent-looking Aryan god with an immense head , bulging forehead , and surprisingly small eyes . Now the building , a shrine of Nazism , was one heap of wreckage . Farther on was the enormous whitecolonnadedHaus der Deutschen Kunst , which the wits of the town had called " the Greek railroad station " ; here Hitler had housed the commonplaceart works of which he approved . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark green in color ; now the net flapped in the wind , but it had done its work , making the bombardiers think it was a park . Lanny went on to the residential district in which the Freiherr had his fine home . Such districts had been spared , except where they were too close to military targets . The Freiherr 's house was intact , but he was n't living there ; the Nazis had turned him out , and he was living in the gardener 's cottage in back . The Americans had taken over the mansion , which pleased the owner greatly , because they would pay him rent and make it possible for him to patronize the black market . He was a round-headed , dark-eyed Bavarian , with dark hair turned gray . He was no longer plump and rosy , but still kept his worldly grace , his bonhomie , and tried his best to take a humorous view of the experiences he had been through . Never tell your troubles , for if you do your friends will stop coming to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and added , " Thank Him we no longer have to talk about blood and soil , blood and race , blood and iron , blood and guts ! " Bavarians of his generation had watched a kaleidoscope of history during the past fifty years : a monarchy with mad rulers , a world war , a Socialist republicp229and a Communist revolution , a democratic republic , and a Nationalist revolution . " And now , " said he , " we have an American Military Government  --  andwhat are you going to do to us ? " " We are going to treat you politely , " replied the assimilated colonel ; " that is , unless you have been a Nazi . I 'll be pleased to give you a clean bill of health , and you can have a position in a new civil government when it is formed . " " Gott behute ! " exclaimed the pious gentleman . " No politics for me ! But if I dared to ask a favor I 'd suggest very humbly that your governmentmight return my paintings that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that happens to be exactly what I am in Munich for . Any objets d'art that you can prove were yours will assuredly be re-turned . " " Technically speaking , they are not mine , for I had to sign a documentparting with them . Herr Walter Andreas Hofer came to see me  --  you know that gentleman , perhaps ? " " I have had the pleasure of meeting him several times . " Lanny did n't say " at Karinhall , " for that would have taken too much explanation . " Such a visit was never a pleasure to any German who owned paintings . Herr Hofer would say , Reichsmarschall Goring 's birthday comes next month , and we think it would be a gracious act to make him a present for his planned National Museum . ' If you owned a good painting , he would suggest that you give it . If you did n't own one good enough for the great Museum , he would tell you about one , and the price ; all you had to do was to pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be to refuse . " " You were fortunate in owning good ones , " Lanny said , smiling . " You will get them back if we can find them . If you had paid money , you might not have stood so good a chance . That question has not come up . " The elderly aristocrat gazed earnestly at this handsome American officer , no doubt trying his best not to look incredulous . " You really mean , lieber Herr Budd , that our property will be returned to us , and not seized for reparations ? " " I am telling you the policy of the organization in which I am serving ; the Monuments , Fine Arts , and Archives Commission . " " You Americans are indeed an extraordinary people ! " " We are hoping to set a standard for international conduct . We shall hang many war criminals , I hope , but we do not plan to rob innocent civilians . "  |p230The  Freiherr let it rest there . Did he remember how he had said to Lanny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expand ? Most Germans had said that , but not one would say that civilians had any sort of responsibility for the hideous things that had been done in the Fatherland . One and all they would assert that they had n't known what was going on , and that , anyhow , there was nothing they could have done . Ein einzelner , machtloser Mensch ! No one of them ever stated whether he had been among those crowds , sometimes a million in one spot , which whooped and roared for National Socialism and its Fiihrer . " What can I do in return ? " inquired the Freiherr , and Lanny said , " You can help us to find where art treasures have been hidden , so that we can return them where they belong . Do you have any idea whether Goring kept any of his accumulations in the South ? " " I am informed that all his Karinhall collection was put into freight cars and brought south , and that the train is somewhere near Berchtesgaden . The French got to it first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do anything altruistic . " " That is indeed most interesting , " said Lanny . " Also , Emmy Goring visits in a Schloss belonging to a rich South American at Zell am See . It is very unlikely that Hermann has failed to trust her with a few old masters , as a safeguard against mischance . I have heard that they are there . " " Besten Dank , Baron . May I ask how you learn things like this ? " " Oh , we Bavarians are great gossips , and when we meet in one another'shomes we talk fast , always in whispers . What other pleasure have we ? A few of us who trusted one another maintained a sort of underground against the Nazis . " " Will you maintain it against us Americans ? " " If you behave in the decent manner you have told me , there will be an underground to help you . I assure you , the news you have just impartedwill create a sensation in the proper social circles , and informationwill be poured in upon you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " May I make notes ? " asked the Monuments man . He had brought a pencil and some paper , on the chance that there might be none in a wealthy Munchner 's home . He made a note of the Goring train and of the castle at Zell am See . He noted that there might be treasures hidden in Ribbentrop 's castle at Fuschl , and also in one of those built by the mad King Ludwig II of Bavaria . There was a colossal hoard in the saltp231mine at Alt Aussee , high up in the mountains southeast of Berchtesgaden ; it was said to contain ten thousand paintings , including most of , and perhaps all , the treasures from the Vienna Museum . And so on and on , until Lanny had a sheet of paper full of notes and the promise of more in a few days . " But do n't mention me , " added Freiherr von Breine . " I can do much more for you that way . " The first outfit of the art seekers arrived , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating place , and a headquarters big enough to hold all the treasures which would be brought in . They were allotted the Verwaltungsbau , the Nazi administration building , one of those immense massive structures which the world 's greatest architect had erected for his Thousand-Year Reich . Everything was built of stone , solid , square , plain , useful , and ugly . It was three stories high and occupied nearly a whole block facing the Konigsplatz . Inside were two large central courts , from each of which a marble stairway led to the floor above . The building had not been hit by bombs but had been badly shaken ; the skylights had been smashed , and rain had poured in ; but very quickly they were boarded up . The doors would n't lock , but they too would be repaired , and the smashed windows covered with translucent plastic . There was a second building , a duplicate of the Verwaltungsbau , the Fuhrerbau , where I Iitler 's own Munich offices had been ; it was only a block away , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Fuhrerbau that Chamberlain had signed the Munich Pact , which was supposed to guarantee peace for our time ; the table on which the signing had been done was now to be used as a conference table by these art experts from the Fogg Museum in Cambridge and other museums of America . Less than seven years had passed , and the Lord had put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degree ! The plan was to engage a staff of German museum technicians and clerks to carry on the enormous work which lay ahead , and here as everywhere was the difficult task of excluding Nazis , in a land where everybody had been compelled to be a Nazi in order to survive . The Monuments were working under pressure ; they had already learned about the train full of Goring 's paintings and realized that this was probably the most valuable collection ever assembled in the world . Something had to be done about it without delay , and they were re- lieved to learn that Lanny had already discussed the matter with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a T-force to lead the way . There was n't supposed to be any more fighting , but there were bands of Nazi fanatics holding out in the forests and mountains , and nobody could tell where they might make a raid . That treasure would call for a night-and-day guard , and a train of trucks to bring it in . Lanny had a claim to go with the first outfit , and it was granted . They were exceptionally nice fellows , informed about all the subjects which he loved best . Two jeeps and a command car sped rapidly over the Autobahn toward Salzburg ; already the shellholes had been filled up , smashed Panzers thrown into ditches , and temporary bridges built ; the engineers with hairy ears did such things overnight . It was almost mid-May , and the sun was warm , the fruit trees in blossom , and the snow-clad mountains a glorious background to every scene . From this far-off perpetual snow flowed torrents of water , running clear green in the many streams , except for the creamy foam . When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the rise into the Austrian Alps . At this southeastern corner of Germany a lumpy peninsula-shaped piece of land juts into Austria , so that at once place you can go west into a land that lies east of you , and at another you can go north into a land that lies south of you . Adi Schicklgruber , onetime wastrel of the Vienna slums , had chosen this region for his mountain retreat and had purchased a property looking out over the land of his birth . He had expandeda modest villa into an establishment suitable for the occupancy of a future ruler of the world . They passed the wide blue Chiemsee , and soon after passing Traunsteinthey left the Autobahn and turned southward . The road sign said " Berchtesgaden , 30 Kilometers . " The road followed a winding stream and was beautifully balanced , so that you could drive fast even on the curves , and the forests sped by as if in a motion-picture film . Lanny did not tell anyone how familiar this road was to him ; how many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in sunshine , rain , and snow . In the first place they would not have believed him , and if anyone did , that one would never have ceased to wonder what sort of man was this , and which side had he really been on . They came into the pleasant little summer-resort town , with manyp233hotels and some baths . Up to three days ago it had been swarming with Nazis , and now it was swarming with " Amis , " as the Nazis called their principal foes . These particular Amis wore a shoulder patch consistingof a blue triangle with a yellow triangle inside and a red triangle inside that , and this meant they were of the Seventh ; their unit was the Joist Airborne Division , very cocky and proud of themselves . They would tell you that the reason the SS were coming down out of those snow-clad Alps so fast was that they wanted the honor of surrendering to so renowned an outfit . The Monuments hunted up the CP and asked about the Goring train . It developed that somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars ' worth of paintings , and the stuff was now being unloaded and taken by a back road to a little place called Unterstein , where there was a rest house until recently used by German officers . This had some fifty rooms , all that could be needed to sort and catalogue nine freighter-car loads of art treasures . So there was no longer an emergency , and the Monuments man in charge of the T-force decided that the thing to do was to go on to Alt Aussee , some seventy miles farther east , inspect the salt mine , and make sure the thousands of paintings there hidden were not in danger from either pillagers or dampness and mold . The CP was n't sure whether their men had got there or not , but they or others from the Third would surely do so in course of the day ; anyhow , it did n't matter so much , for word had just come that in Berlin the three German commanders  --  of Army ( Keitel ) , Navy ( Friedeburg ) , and Air Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrender of all German Armed Forces , to be effective at one minute past eleven o'clock that night . Lanny asked the officer who gave them the news , " Why that extra minute ? " The officer , who came from the Bronx in New York , answered , " Dunt esk ! " So this was VE Day , so long desired , so long postponed ! There was wild rejoicing at home , but not much in the Army ; people were too tired . War was no fun , and do n't let anybody tell you different  --  so said the doughs , the Joes , the sad sacks . Here and there the officers shook hands , and a few of them took too many drinks . The enlisted men repeated their old question , " When do we get to go home ? " Do n't talk to any of them about picturesque and historic buildings , without plumbing or central heating or other comforts ! Let the Frenchies and the Heinies have their art and culture , and give us the corner drugstore with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new program twice a week  --  in the American language !  |p234The  Monuments studied their maps , and meantime Lanny thought it over ; then he said , " I do n't suppose it will make any difference to you if I stay here . There are some people I can talk to , and maybe get information of importance . " They knew what he had already got and wished him luck . For eight years Lanny Budd 's thoughts had been swinging , pendulumlike , between the White House in Washington and Hitler 's Berghof , up on the heights to the east of this little town . He had seen the Fuhrer in many other places , but this was the place of his own choice , the place that revealed his soul . Berchtesgaden had been named for a wild witch , and Adi loved all the imaginings of the Urgermane who had worn bearskins and lived in the dark forests of this land . Deep in his soul he believed in all these creatures , the witches , elves , giants , ogres , gnomes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took the Niebelungenlied for history and the Ring for the whole of music and poetry . The old bloody legends had worked in his subconsciousness , and made him willing to exterminate some ten or twenty million people for the crime of not being German . Almost in sight of his retreat was the village of Braunau , in the Austrian Innviertel , where he had been born , and beyond it was the town of Linz where his mother had been born , and where he had meant to erect in her memory a temple of art that would cast Karinhall into the shade . Now he was dead , it appeared , and his Thousand-Year Reich and all his other dreams . His Berghof was a burned-out ruin , and Lanny had seen enough of these . But up on the Obersalzberg was a living woman  --  or so he hoped . A year and a half had passed since he had called upon her and she had given him food and a guide to help him escape into Italy . He had n't been able to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a visit and see how she was . As a source of underground whispers she was even better than Freiherr von Breine . She had had her summer chalet here ever since she had married , unhappily , the Furst Donnerstein much older than herself ; that meant some thirty years , and she knew all the grosse Welt which had sought refuge in these mountains , and her servants knew their servants . It was a pleasant afternoon 's walk from the town , and Lanny proposed to enjoy it on a delightful bright day . But Major Jennings of G-2 , to whom he broached the project , said that it was out of the question . The war was n't even over yet , and any German soldier had the legalp235right to shoot any American in uniform . In these woods were hiding not merely Nazi fanatics but displaced persons and escaped prisoners from a dozen nations and plain bandits on the rampage . Mr. Budd 's OSS credentials were of the best , and if he had business that called him to the Obersalzberg the Army would provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go strolling off as if this were the Adirondacks . So the ex-P.A. rode in state in a Mercedes car , with an armed chauffeur and a tommy gunner in front , and nobody took a shot at them . There was the familiar chalet , intact , and there was Hilde , Fiirstin Donnerstein , out in her garden , picking caterpillars off her cabbages like any peasant woman . In the old days she would have had a wide basket and been cutting roses for her dinner table ; she had loved roses , and now she loved cabbages . She had been beautiful and gay , and now her hair was gray and her face lined and the skin of her hands freckled and toughened by outdoor work . She was sad , for her mother had died in the bombing of their Berlin palace and her sister was ill in the house . There was no doctor to be had  --  they were all tending wounded and dying men . She was delighted to see this vision from the free world . " I knew that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " He explained that he was a noncombatant , and she said it was all right with her either way  --  all the decent people of Germany were sick of the Nazis and their works . She took him out to the summerhouse built on a point of rock where they had sat in happier times . From there you could see where the Berghof had been , and she offered to get her opera glasses and let him inspect the ruins . He said no , it saddenedhim to think of the house being bombed , for it had been a beautiful place ; but it would have been a Nazi shrine , of course , and the Americans did n't want to leave any monuments to that evil creed . They would be careful not to make any martyrs either ; nobody would be punished until he had had a public trial and been proved a criminal . " That will include your neighbor , Der Dicke , " he said with a smile , and she told him the amazing story of what had been happening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone to Berlin and tried to convinceHitler that the war was lost , but Hitler would not be convinced and had flown into one of his rages ; Goring had come away and told his friends that the Fuhrer was insane . Later he had telephoned Hitler , proposing to take over Germany and carry out the surrender ; Hitler in return had called him a traitor and scoundrel and had ordered the SS to seize him and shoot him at once . The SS had obeyed the first half of the order , but they had hesitated about the second half , for the Reichsmarschall with his jeweled baton was a majestic person in their eyes . In the confusion of defeat there had been a conflict of authority , and a group of Goring 's paratroopers had dashed in and rescued him and carried him off somewhere into the mountains . " What a story ! " he exclaimed . " What a world we are living in ! " " I have a hard time making up my mind that I want to go on living in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking well and happy . Tell me how you got away . " He told the story of his walking and hitchhiking southward , and how by the combined magic of Italian Partisans and American secret agents he had been carried out into the Adriatic on a fishing boat and picked up by a seaplane . Now he was looking for art works hidden by the Nazi plunderers , and she was the one who was going to collect information for him in this neighborhood ; he had some secret funds which he was authorized to pay out for such services , and there was no reason in the world why she should n't have some . " Moreover , " he said with one of his cheerful grins , " I 'll get you some insecticide from the PX , and you 'll be able to spray your cabbages instead of picking off the bugs with your aristocratic fingers . " " There wo n't be anything aristocratic in Germany any more , " she mourned ; and he said he wished he could believe that , but feared it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds , " he told her ; " especially industrials . Roosevelt is dead , and my guess is that America is going to uphold what it calls the private enterprise system all over the world . When the factories start up again you will once more be able to live in luxury on the toil of the German workers . " " Lanny , how horrid ! " she exclaimed in English , for her speech was cosmopolitan , like her taste and acquaintanceship . " I thought you got over all that Socialism long ago ! " " I was only posing , old dear , " he told her . " I am still as Pink as the roses that you used to grow . " " Some roses are Red , " she warned . " And , lieber Gott , those awful Russians ! Are you going to let them get hold of us ? " He promised to use his best influence in Washington , provided that she would tell him all that she could about the hiding places of art treasures in the Bavarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . without delay . She told him about several places on the Obersalzberg where Goring would be apt to have such works hidden . " You know his hunting lodge here ? " she asked ; and he reminded her how he had sat before an enormous log fire in that sumptuous place and heard Der Dicke discourse upon the joys of sticking a spear into a wild pig . " You should have a search made in those forests , " she said ; " undoubtedly he has hiding places there . Emmy went to Berchtesgaden when he was arrested and has fled to the mountains with him . She will be pretty sure to come hack to Zell , and there is where she would have her paintings  --  unless they are in the trunk of her car . I do n't need to tell you that a single Rembrandt might be enough to keep a woman in comfort the rest of her life . " Also , there was Ribbentrop ; he fancied himself as an esthete , in art as in every other way , and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , and Rosenberg , for whom the Einsatzstab had been named ; there had been the bitterest rivalry between him and Goring as to who should get the first choice of prizes , and if those two men were caught they would no doubt tell on each other . Adolf Wagner , lame Nazi boss of Munich , was a great plunderer too , but Hilde did n't know what had become of him . Hofer , Goring 's so-called curator , was in Berchtesgaden , a red-headed rascal who cheated everybody , including his master . Lanny said , " I met him at Karinhall ; he is a great talker . " " They say he has a remarkable memory and knows the owner and price of every objet d'art that ever passed through his hands . All he will want is a promise of immunity for himself . " That went on for an hour or so ; Lanny did n't trust to his memory , but made quick notes . He did n't linger in her house , for he knew that she was a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , to use the New York phrase . He gave her a box of delicacies from the Army PX , and he promised to come again and not forget t he insecticide . This was a product unobtainable in Germany , because the materials had gone into the making of poison gases for war . The Nazis had prepared enormous quantities but had never used them , because they knew that the Amis had them too.  | The investigator went back to Berchtesgaden and talked with Major Jennings , the top Intelligence officer of the outfit stationed here . He told this man what information he had got ; and now that the fighting was to end in a few hours , G-2 had more time to think about Monumentsand their problems . " Might n't it be a good thing to raid that hunting lodge ? " Lanny asked , and Major Jennings replied , " I 'll suggestit , and I 'm sure it will be done . Any of these people you want brought in for questioning , just say the word . " Lanny answered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them first as an art expert . They realize that their game is played out , and they want to make friends with their new masters . " " They make me sick to my stomach , " was the other 's comment . " Here in this vulture 's nest you ca n't find a single one that ever wore so much as a vulture 's feather . " The officer went off and talked to his commander , and when he came back he had an important item of news . " A report has just come in  --  Goring has surrendered . Sent out a white flag , and we went into the mountains and got him . He was more afraid of the Russians than he was of us . " " Where is he ? " and when Lanny heard " Kitzbuhel , " he added , " I believe I could get more out of him than anybody else in the Army . He has counted me as a friend for more than a dozen years and has told me many secrets . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a perfect cover story  --  that Himmler tried to get me to turn against the Fuhrer . I was afraid it would sound fishy , but Himmler has made it true by actually doing just that . " " We have been alerted to look out for that bird ; he may have come this way , looking for his Redoubt . " " Nothing he says can do me any harm , for no one is believing any Nazis now . I think I ought to go to Kitzbuhel right away , Major . I may be able to get Goring to talk , not merely about paintings but about all the gangsters he hates , and where his confidential papers are , and a lot of other things . Can you spare me a car again ? " " Sure thing . I 'll give you a note to Major General Dahlquist , who commands our 36th Division . It 's a great feather in his cap to have captured the Number Two . " " Poor , old hulk ! " said Lanny . " He ceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . Will you mark the note personal ' and instruct one of your men to deliver it ? There is bound to be a swarm of newspapermen at the place , and my specialty has been operating on the q.t . " " Sure thing , " said Major Jennings again . Lanny delayed only long enough to get his overcoat and a few other belongings , including a box of rations which he would eat while being driven in the car . Major Jennings had obtained permission to go along , which would facilitate matters greatly . It was late afternoon , but the days were long , and the sun had not yet disappeared behind the mountains . Kitzbuhel is a winter resort to the southwest of Berchtesgaden , well inside the Austrian border . They traveled by secondary roads , windingup valleys and through mountain passes for three hours . Meantime Lanny talked about this extraordinary man he was going to meet , the man who had interested him most of any of the Nazis , not even exceptingHitler  --  for he had a better mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goring was a combination of vile qualities and great capacities ; a first-class brain and a perverted soul . He was a slave to greed and lust for power ; he was an exhibitionist , a bundle of vanities ; but at the same time he had a sense of humor and could laugh at jokes about what he was doing to the German people . He had been brought up in a school of military cynicism and as a young flight officer had known the bitterness of defeat ; he had become a drug addict and had suffered the loss of the woman he adored . Then had come Hitler , a master hypnotist , a mass hypnotist ; Goring had seen success and glory there , and had climbed into Hitler 's war chariot , and lent this man of demonic fury the use of his organizing brain . He had climbed to the height of what was called greatness in Germany ; he had devised for himself a whole wardrobe of fancy uniforms and had covered his expansive chest with medals and decorations ; he had taken unto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all . Lanny amused his traveling companion by seeing how many he could call to mind : Marshal of Greater Germany , Field Marshal General , Supreme War Economic Authority , President of the Reichstag , Chairman of the Council for Defense of the Reich , Commissioner in Control of Transportation , Chairman of the Wartime Ministerial Council , Chief Hunter ,  |p240Governor  of Prussia , Chief of Prussian Secret Police , Infantry Generalof the Reichswehr , Minister of the Forests , Minister of Aviation , Premier of Prussia , Nazi Minister without Portfolio , Member of the Secret Cabinet Council , Director of State Theaters and Operas .. . From all that he had become a prisoner at Hitler 's order , barely escaping execution by the SS ; and now he was a prisoner of his enemies , those who , he had said , would never be able to set foot on German soil or even drop a bomb thereon . Now he knew that he had brought destruction to the Reich 's great cities and death to the flower of its young manhood . He knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content , his medals turned to junk . He had reached the depths of humiliation ; and how would he take it ? Lanny said , " I am guessing he will have a new role and have found a way to bluff it through . " The command car arrived long after dark , and Lanny sat back in his seat , waiting while Major Jennings went into headquarters and talked with the officers . He came back saying " OK , " and the car was driven around to a rear entrance of the commandeered Grand Hotel . There was Goring 's own car , a sixteen-cylinder Maibach , with steel plates two inches thick and glass twice as thick as that . There would , no doubt , be newspaper correspondents in the hotel lobby , but Lanny did n't see them and they did n't see him . He was escorted to a room and introduced to Major General Dahlquist , commander of this division , whom he had met before when the Army had come ashore on the Riviera ; also to Brigadier General Stack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept the surrender of this VGDIP . They inspected an ex-P.A. ' s credentials and put questions to make sure that he really did know the Nummer Zwei Nazi . Ne gave them his pledge to report everything of importance that Goring might say ; they assented to his idea that he should talk with the prisoner alone and that he should fraternize . So far , nobody had shaken hands with " Unser Hermann , " but Lanny would do so , and perhaps even pat him on the back . " He will probably cry , " said the art expert . And , sure enough , he did ! He had been all alone in the hands of his enemies for nearly twenty-four hours ; he had been stripped of his medals , his weapons , and his jeweled baton of authority . His field-gray coat was unpressed and dingy looking , and his features flabby andp241ashen gray . To be sure , he had had a good dinner of chicken with peas and potatoes , and that meant a lot to him ; but what food for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Budd ! " he exclaimed as the visitor walked into his suite . His face showed surprise and a flash of pleasure . Lanny said , " Lieber Hermann ! " Then , seeing a shadow darken the other 's face , he spoke quickly , " Do n't tell me , alter Freund , that you have been believing false reports about me ! " " You are wearing an American uniform ! " replied the other ; and Lanny began his routine explanation , that he was only an assimilated officer , bearing no arms and concerned solely with the protection of art works . That was a humane occupation , and surely not one that his German friends could take ill . " Horen Sie , Hermann , " he went on , speaking German as they always did . " I came to you the moment I heard you were here , for you are the friend whose good opinion I most value . Hear my story with an open mind . I am sure you will not take the word of Heinrich Himmler against mine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had tried it out on Heinrich Jung and Gunther Furtwangler . It was a story cut to fit the Reichsmarschall , who hated Himmler beyond any other Nazi , as the man who had supplanted him in the Fuhrer 's favor and had kept him out in the cold for a couple of years . Only a few days ago this odious usurper had publicly tried to sell out his Fiihrer to the Allies , and it was easy to believe that he had been cherishing this idea for some time . Lanny told how he had been waiting in the New ChancelleryBuilding for the Fiihrer to return from the front when the former poultry grower had come in and put him through a shrewd cross-questioning , designed to find out his attitude to the Fiihrer and to the war , and leading up to the question of the Allies ' attitude to the peace , and what that attitude would be if they no longer had Hitler to deal with . " It froze my very bones , Hermann , " declared the art expert . " I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned him about them ; and here was this most dangerous man in Germany trying to draw me into them . I could n't be sure whether he was in such a plot himself or whether he would just permit them to succeed and take advantage of the event . What he was trying to find out from me was what the attitude of the Allies would be toward a German regime headed by a dependable non-political person such as Heinrich Himmler . " " What did you tell him ? " inquired Der Dicke . He fixed his small ,  | hard blue eyes upon his visitor  --  and this was unusual for him , for his eyes had a way of darting here and there while listening . " I told him that I was a non-political person , like himself , and I did n't know the answer to his question . I realized that from that moment my life was in danger . I had come into Germany because the Fiihrer had asked me to , and I was anxious to help him ; but what could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word of an alien enemy against that of the man whom he most trusted , the man upon whom he depended for the protection of his life ? " " Why did n't you come to me ? " " What right did I have to put such a burden upon any friend ? I knew that if you took my side it might be your life against Himmler 's ; and you yourself had told me that you had lost favor at court . I took it that the kindest thing I could do was to keep out of your way . " " How did you get out of Germany ? " " I had a friend from the old days , an entirely non-political person . I went to him , and he let me stay with him for a week or two and then sent me to Italy as his business representative . What troubled me most was that I knew false rumors would be spread about me and that my friends would believe them . You know how many people were jealous of my position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ousted . " Would Goring swallow this tale ? Lanny knew that he was nobody 's fool ; but he could n't be certain that the tale was false , and anyhow it might please him to pretend to believe it . After all , what did it matter now ? He was lonely , and Lanny had always been good company ; especially so at present , because he came from the outside world . If he had been a rascal he had been a shrewd one , and that did n't make him any the less interesting to talk to . The prisoner wanted very much to know what was going to happen to him . He had the idea that he was to be taken to General Eisenhower ; he thought his military rank entitled him to that , and Lanny promised to support his petition . Then he wanted to know , should he carry his baton , and should he wear a pistol ? Lanny said that these were questions for a military man , not for a mere Monument . This was protocol , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubted veryp243much whether Hermann Wilhelm Goring would ever see General Ike and whether he would ever again wear a pistol in this life . Kindness and joviality had been the fat man 's role ever since Lanny had known him , and he played it exactly as in old days . He had had a rare adventure , being rescued in Berchtesgaden and fleeing up into the snow-covered heights , surrounded by a company of his own trusted officers and men . He told about it with zest , admitting that he had a bad scare  --  for that belonged in his role of frankness . He was furious against Hitler . Ungrateful wretch ! After all that Hermann had done for him ! The last time Goring had seen him , April 22 , with the Russianspounding at the gates of Berlin , his behavior had indicated a cracked mind . Later on , over the telephone , he had screamed like a maniac . " You know , he often raved at people , but he always knew what he was doing and stopped when he was through . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too terrible . He issued orders to divisions and corps that no longer existed ; he jumped them about as if they were chessmen , ignoring the fact that they could not travel the roads by day on account of your airmen . When I told him that the few planes we had left were grounded for lack of fuel , he shouted at me , I order them to fly ! ' Of course , one does not get planes off the ground just by words . " " Do you think he is dead , Hermann ? " " I do not doubt it . He had told me many times that he would never be taken alive . " " But might he not have escaped ? " " He could n't bring himself to face the thought of defeat , and when at last the idea was forced upon him , it was too late . The Russians broke through suddenly , and it was the same here in the south ; we had planned to set up a Redoubt and make a last-ditch stand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half . " Lanny thought it good tactics to remark , " I think I ought to tell you , Hermann ; in order to get permission to come here and see you , I had to promise that I would tell our officers everything you said . " Der Dicke shrugged his heavy shoulders . " What difference does it make now ? Alles ist kaput . You will have all our records ; we Germans are great keepers of records , you know , and here , too , the speed of your armies governs the situation . There has been no time to burn cry much . "  |p244This  was the occasion for a Monuments man to explain the special purpose for which he was here . To talk about art was the best way to cheer up an old-style robber baron , threatened with melancholia ; to appeal to him as a fellow esthete was the way to gain his heart . To be sure , it took a lot of persuading to get him to believe that the American government had gone to the trouble and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending them over to Germany in order to return art works to their former owners whether these owners happened to be French or Dutch or Polish or even Jews . Hermann had had a vision of his vast collection being shipped to New York and Washington and other American cities ; he had been sure that would happen to the treasures of the Kaiser Friedrich Museum of Berlin , the Gemaldegallerie in Dresden , and the other priceless public collections . Lanny had to swear upon his honor as an art lover and a friend that this was not so , that all such collections were considered to be the property of the German people , upon whom the Americans had never been waging war . You could n't expect Hermann Wilhelm Goring to have any honor as a politician or a man ; but , oddly enough , he still dreamed of perpetuatinghis name as a connoisseur of art . Once Lanny had convinced him on that level , he agreed that the wisest thing he could do was to entrust his priceless possessions to the care of this well-informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscientiously he himself had guarded the treasures , even in the confusion of defeat . The railway cars in which he had shipped the Karinhall collection had all been air-conditioned , and never once had they been kept in any building that was not fireproof . " It was my intention to present Karinhall as a museum to the German people on my sixtieth birthday , in 1953 , " said Der Dicke ; and no fat face could have looked more mournful when he said , " Now I wonder where I will be on that date ! " Lanny exclaimed , " Nur Mut , Hermann ! Eight years is a long time these days , and I can not prophesy ; but I can tell you that several springs hotels in Virginia and North Carolina have been set aside as dwelling places for the higher German officers , and since most of the rooms have private baths , they are far more comfortable to live in than any German castle . " The ex-P.A. asked permission to make notes . He jotted down the fact that the Karinhall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pegnitz River in Northern Bavaria . When Patton had got too near to that , it had been removed to Berchtesgaden . Lanny could give the assurance that it would be taken to the Fuhrerbau in Munich , and that the same thing would be done with the Vienna and other collections now in the Alt Aussee salt mines . Lanny told how the treasures of the Kaiser Friedrich were safe in the vaults of the Reichsbank in Frankfurt ; his wife had been there and inspected them . Thus encouraged , Goring imparted the fact that the crown jewels of the Holy Roman Empire had been taken to Nurnberg and walled up under the Paniers-Platz ; these included the crown of Charlemagne , which the Pope had placed upon that emperor 's head in the year Boo . The Prussian crown jewels had been placed in a sort of shrine , along with the bones of Frederick the Great and of Frederick William the Great Elector , and buried deep in a salt mine in Central Germany . And that was n't all . There were those Nazi rascals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reichsmarschall 's . That scoundrelRibbentrop , and that upstart and nobody Martin Bormann , who had managed to worm himself into the Fuhrer 's graces  --  imagine such men setting up as art authorities ! And Himmler , if you please ; and that deranged mentality Rosenberg  --  " He got his name on the organization , but I got the best of the stuff  --  ha , ha , ha ! " said Hermann . He was alluding to the ERR , the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg , which had been set up to handle the art plundering in foreign lands . Goring told where each of these collectors had kept his treasures ; he told where they would probably be hidden ; and when he did n't know he told the names of subordinates and advisers who would tell if they were well frightened . Evidently the Third Reich was breaking up not merely militarily but morally . Der Dicke did n't have a good word to say for a single one of the men with whom he had been co-operating for almost a quarter of a century . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say what he really thought , and he pointed out that Hitler had never traveled and was both narrow and ignorant ; that was why he had let himself be lured into the frightful blunder of a two-front war  --  t hat turned into a multiple-front war before it finished . Imagine attackingRussia , and then six months later declaring war on the United States  --  and just to oblige Japan ! " As if Japan would be able to give us any help ! " " Did you know the attack on Pearl Harbor was coming ? " asked Lanny ; and the answer was , " We were as much surprised as you . I was still in the Fuhrer 's confidence in those days , and I am sure he would have told me if he had known . I suppose the Japs were afraid to trust us . " The prisoner of war went on to recall how bitterly he had opposed the attack upon Russia . " You can bear witness to that , Lanny , " and Lanny could and did . " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The more I turned out to be right , the more it annoyed the Fuhrer , until he could no longer bear to confront me . You see , in the early days he acted against the advice of his generals and was proved right so many times that he came to think of himself as infallible , and he had to prove it , even if it meant the ruin of all Germany . The evidence of his rightness was the territory he had taken , and he could n't bear to give up a single foot of it  --  at Stalingrad , or in France , or the Rhineland , or the Ruhr . " " A terrible set of calamities , " Lanny agreed  --  to keep him going . " What beat us was your country 's industrial power . I warned the Fuhrer about it , but even I had only a slight idea of what you could do . Your father must have a colossal plant by now . " " He has indeed ; but I have n't seen it for some time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recognize that this war would be won by air power and to concentrate on that . But I suppose he thought I was just trying to get glory for my own branch of the services . He spent our energies on rockets , when it should have been engines for planes . And meantime you built bombers , bigger and bigger . I knew you would do it , but I must admit I never thought you 'd be able to get a fighter-bomber that could fly to Berlin and back . " This post mortem went on for a long while . There was no further need for secrecy , and Lanny mentioned the proximity fuse , and the radar and Loran devices that had enabled night-fighters to find and hit their enemy in complete darkness . He said , " I do n't suppose you waste any love upon the laps ; and if you have new things , they might be useful to us in that part of the world . " So Goring talked freely about new German war devices , and where they were being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the thing Lanny had come for , and he did not fail to make careful notes . Thus there was a V-2 rocket that could be fired from a submarine  --  and the submarine did n't have to come to the surface but could fire : from three hundred feet under water . " That would have been prettyp247good off New York harbor , nicht wahr ? " said Goring with one of his old-time smiles . Lanny answered , " It may be pretty good off Tokyo harbor . " Also there was an improved V-a  --  the " flying telegraph pole "  --  almost ready for service , and having a range of eighteen hundred miles ; and there was the dreaded V-3 , which was to fly through the stratosphere from Berlin to New York and even farther . " It 's really too bad we could n't have had a try at that ! " said the genial Reichsmarschall ; but now alles was kaput , and the Americans were free to dig out all these secrets at Peenemiinde and at the huge rocket-assembly plant built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then Goring asked a question that startled Lanny , though a practicedintriguer did n't show it . " Did you ever visit a place called Oak Ridge , Tennessee ? " The other replied , quite truthfully , " No , " and then added a dutiful lie , " I do n't think I ever heard of it . " " Our Intelligence Service in America has n't been anything to brag about , but we were told that at that place you have built a tremendous plant with the idea of making an atomic bomb . Of course it may be just camouflage for some other line of activity . " Said Lanny , " That is something outside my father 's province , and I would n't know about it . If it comes off , we can be glad it wo n't be over Germany . " " Our physicists tell us it 's a delusion , " said Goring . " They were happy to know that you were wasting your resources on it . " " It may have been one of Roosevelt 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , you know , and followed them , just like Hitler . " It was late , and the fat man 's eyelids showed signs of drooping . The visitor remarked tactfully , " I am keeping you too long . You have been generous as always , Hermann . You may rest assured that I shall do everything in my power to see that your precious paintings are kept safe for the benefit of posterity . " " Thank you , " said the old-time robber baron . Lanny had thought of him thus the first time they had , met ; later , when Lanny knew him better and became aware of his love of art , he had called him a " Renaissance man , " and this had pleased him greatly  --  he had even taken up the phrase . Now he remarked , " I had the best of those paint.  | ings in my home , Lanny , and never a day passed that I did n't look at them ; they became a part of my being . Now you will send me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones . It will be like being marooned on a desert island . " Then it was that tears came into the eyes of this Renaissance man ; not for the great German cities that had been blasted to rubble , not for the millions of German youths who had been turned into carrion , but for the Cranachs and the Rembrandts , the Rubenses and the Holbeinsand the Van Dycks , that he was never going to see again ; for the greatest art collection that had ever been assembled in the whole of history and that had been planned to earn the gratitude of posterity and carry the name of Hermann Wilhelm Goring down through all the ages of mankind ! " Lorenzo di Medici would have been a mere footnote to the history of that bright name ! "  --  so he said . DRIVING back to Berchtesgaden , Lanny thought about the mail he might get there , and one letter in particular that he had been expectingfor a year and a half . Now , if ever , was the time when he should get word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of her hiding place and be trying to get in touch with her family . She would have no way to find out where Lanny was , but she would write to her mother at Bienvenu ; Beauty had come back from Marrakech and was waiting in painful suspense and perhaps joining her husband in prayer . Marceline could n't be sure that her mother was still alive , or that the villa at Bienvenu was still in existence ; but she could be sure that Budd-Erling Aircraft Corporation was functioningand that a cablegram to Robbie would reach him or , if he had died , some member of his family . Marceline was a capable person and knew her way about in the world . Lanny had informed her as to her status ; she was an Americanp249citizen , if she chose to enter that claim , by virtue of her mother 's being of American birth . That she had voluntarily gone to Germany after America was at war with that country , and had taken a position as a dancer in a Berlin night club , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it could hardly interfere with her citizenshipstatus . And in the confusion of the present moment who would remember dates or bother to ask questions on such a point ? Marceline would go to the nearest American Army post and report herself as an American citizen who had hidden out during the war . She would requestand obtain permission to write through Army channels to her mother on the French Riviera and to cable her half-brother in Newcastle , Connecticut . Somehow or other word would surely come . But there was no word ; Lanny with sorrow made up his mind that there was never going to be such word . Someday , perhaps , in the records of the SS or the Gestapo , the mystery might he solved ; some day Heinrich Himmler might be captured  --  he was reported as havingfled to Norway  --  and Lanny might go to him and get the answer . Meantime there were the living ; a letter from Beauty , saying that all three of them were back home , safe and well ; a letter from Laurel , reporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Seventh in Heidelberg and had extracted from them the promise that in a week  --  " about a week , " they said  --  they would consider it safe to let a lady writer travel to Berchtesgaden and report what she found in the haunts of the wild witch and the wild wizard . Lanny wrote a report for Professor Goudsmit and one for Monuments , of which he sent carbon copies to the chiefs in the various collectingpoints , Munich , Frankfurt , Marburg , and one to the headquarters in Versailles . That duty done , he was free to ride in a Monuments car to Alt Aussee , some seventy miles southeast of Berchtesgaden  --  the distance being made greater by winding through mountain passes and down into valleys . Beautiful scenery , with snow still in the high places , but melting fast and turning small rivulets into rushing torrents . Endless vistas of evergreen forests , and in the valleys lovely little villages with irregular streets and brightly painted houses with many gables  --  " gingerbreadhouses , " the Americans called them . This was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except in the last hours . The GI who drove him had been going back and forth and knew the landmarks . Soon after leaving Salzburg , there was Lake Fuschl , with the castle that Ribbentrop had stolen . Then came the Wolfgangsee , with the Weisse ROssel , the inn famed in musical comedies . Would Doc like to get out and see the old church , with the Pacher altar ? And then Bad Ischl , where the old Emperor Franz Joseph had had his summer home . There he had bought a villa for an actress . Then a steep pass , and Bad Aussee , and after it Alt Aussee , on a deep dark lake , where the world seemed to come to an end , lost in mountains . The Third Army , Lucky Forward , had got here first , and its 11th Armored Division was guarding the mine . Lanny had no businessbeing here without a permit ; he had to go at once and explain himself and get one , and be warned not to travel anywhere in Third territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the subject of regulations : wearing your cap , keeping your coat collar buttoned , saluting snappily  --  all those Army things which the doughs contemptuously called " chicken . " You could n't have more than five gallons of gas at a time , and the rule against officers driving cars was rigidly enforced . The mine was high up , in the Salzberg  --  the salt mountain . It was the steepest road Lanny had ever traveled . Near it was " House 71 , " as it was called , a villa with a heavy iron fence and padlocked gates . Here two OSS men had taken up their abode , and they welcomed Lanny as a colleague . They had brought with them for questioning no less a personage than Herr Walther Andreas Hofer , the Berlin art dealer whom Goring had chosen as his number-one expert and supervisorof plundering . The OSS had discovered him in Berchtesgaden and had brought him to this remote region to keep him away from evil influences . Lanny , who had known him at Karinhall , was greeted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in gray tweeds , Hofer was to all appearances perfectly happy ; he was loquacious , a show-off , and here were important persons who were willing to devoteall their time to listening to him . This was the man who was credited with having invented the ingeniousscheme of inviting wealthy Germans to give art presents to the Reichsmarschall on his birthday . Hofer had a most extraordinary memory ; he knew the name of every such donor , what he had given , and the price he had paid for it . He could remember every art transactionhe had carried on since the coming of the Nazis ; the name of the painting , the price asked and the price paid , the size of the work , and sometimes even the kind of frame it was in . There were some things that he professed to have forgotten ; but when Lanny told himp251how he had visited Goring only the night before last and obtained the great man 's approval of the American program , Herr Hofer suddenlyremembered a lot more . Lanny spent the night at House 71 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last few days . The balked and frenzied SS , seeing the Americans drawing near , had brought large cases containing dynamite , preparing to blow up and flood the mine and destroy all the art works in one grand bust . But the miners had risen and had blown up the mine entrances , making it impossible for the Nazis to get in . The American Army had arrived in the nick of time  --  " ten , twenty , thirty , " said one of the OSS men ; there was so much melodramain this war that the movies would be telling about it for a thousand years . In this case it was not a virtuous maiden who was saved but a hundred thousand objets d'art , many of which were quite literally priceless . A space had been chopped into the mountainside to make level ground , and a group of clean white two-story buildings had been erected , buildings with steep roofs to run the snow off , and with many gables and chimneys . These were the administration buildings of the salt mine , called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , and the guide opened a back door in the lower floor of the building , and it was the main entrance to the mine . Lanny had been through a salt mine of the same kind , escaping from Germany , so it was no novelty to him . The salt is not mined in the usual sense of that word ; enormous basins are dug inside the mine and water is pumped into them ; the water absorbs the salt out of the heavy clay and then the water is pumped out and evaporated outside . That process has been going on for three thousand years , so legend declares ; it is definitely known to have been going for six hundred . For that long , at least , imperial Austria had been breeding a race of men who specialized in working a mile inside a mountain and with another mile of mountain over their heads . The men were small but sturdy and had queer wizened faces ; it was impossible for the Americansnot to call them gnomes , and that did n't hurt their feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , difficult even for other Germans . They wore at their work an odd costume of white duck , the jacket having a collar like a cape , and large black buttons up the front . Germany and Old Austria were disciplined countries ,  | and everybody worked cheerfully if he could have a uniform to symbolizehis special abilities and obligations . Salt mines had been chosen as art shelters because the salt absorbs moisture and makes them comparatively dry ; also the temperature is uniform , about forty degrees Fahrenheit , and , oddly enough , slightly warmer in winter . The systematic Germans had come , curators , restorers , and a great staff of clerks ; for there had to be exact records of everything . There were 6755 paintings , 5350 of them being old masters . More than half bore tags reading " A.H. , Linz , " meaning that they were the property of Adolf Hitler , intended for that thousandyearmuseum that was to end all museums . A little train run by a gasoline engine took you into the mine . There were tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for two men facing each other . The jagged rock ceiling of the long tunnel was menacingly close , but it would never hit you unless you were taller than the gnomes . The tunnels ran immense distances , and every now and then there was a locked iron door at the side . You unlocked the door and there was a grotto . It might be full of Louis XV chairs and tables , arranged as in a drawing-room ; or you might find yourself confronted by Michelangelo 's statue of the Madonna , carved in 1501 , and stolen by the Nazis from the Bruges Cathedral ; or by the marvelous Van Eyck altarpiece , called " The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb , " dating from the fifteenth century , taken from the Ghent Cathedral . There might be mysterious sealed cases ; or boxes full of gold and silver Renaissance armor ; or stacked-up bales of tapestries ; or vegetable baskets piled with all sorts of miscellaneous art objects . Many of the paintings were carefully wrapped and lay on numberedracks ; others had evidently been brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the part of the mine called the " Springerwerke " there were no doors to lock , and here stood GIs on duty , wearing the long fleece-lined coats which the Germans had made for use on the Russian front . Inside these places Lanny inspected paintings which he had come to know at the Berghof ; they now bore that sacred label : " A.H. , Linz . " In other rooms the marking was " ERR , " Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg . There were rooms divided into small compartments , and here the art treasures bore the names of various Jewish families in Vienna ; their return would be easy  --  if there were any members of those families left alive.  |p253There  appeared to be no limit to the kind of stuff in this strange repository : Egyptian tombs , Greek and Roman portrait busts , Gothic relics , gold and silver church vessels , manuscripts , books and prints , furniture , rugs , jewels , coins , porcelain . Lanny had seen the like only once before in his life , in the Bronx , New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enormous warehouse to contain the treasures he never had time to look at . WilliamRandolph Hearst had paid for the stuff with the pennies he had collected from newspaper readers over a period of more than half a century ; under the laws of the business game that made it proper , and you could not indict him for the mass of crime , scandal , and political reaction he had fed to the American people through those years . The Monuments men were at work here , measuring , estimating weights , and figuring how to handle this precious material ; how many trucks it would require , and what size . The miners would give willing help , for they wanted to clear the stuff out and get back to their proper business . Whatever had been got in somehow could be got out somehow ; it would be carted to those two immense buildings in Munich and there classified and ultimately returned to the land from which it had come . The plan was to put off the job of finding the original owners upon each country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned over to that country and a receipt signed by the proper official . Back in the town of Berchtesgaden , he found a letter from Laurel , saying that she had got permission and was coming . So he waited , indulging himself meanwhile in the pleasure of walking in these foothillsand talking with the German people , not in the guise of a Nazi but as he really was . One and all they were polite , even obsequious , and one and all denied ever having had any sympathy with the Nazis , What they really thought was impossible to know . At home were people who talked blithely about the project of making the German people over according to the pattern of democracy ; but the **33;3816;TOOLONG Urach had to admit to himself that Inc would hardly know how to set about it . The magazine writer in search of copy put in her appearance . Her first question was , " Any news about Marceline ? " He told her that he had about given up hope , and that cast a shadow over their meet- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this most dreadfulof wars was over . The whole world took on a different aspect , and she could draw a free breath for the first time in nearly six years . Lanny 's reply was peculiar ; he said that he felt let down ; the war had kept him in a state of tension , and now he missed it . The wife said , " How like you men ! I believe you are all as bad as General Patton ! " For the first time she could ask him questions and he was free to answer . He did not tell her everything at once ; there were some painful experiences that he would never tell . But he satisfied her curiosity about his friendship with Hitler , something which had been a mystery to her since she had first come to know him . How had it been possible , and what had Hitler seen in him ? An ancient Roman emperor had made the remark , " Pecunia non olet "  --  money has no smell ; but Adi Schicklgruber had proved that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of smell for money , and especially for that which might be obtained for his cause . In the early days he had diligently cultivated Frau Bechstein , widow of the piano manufacturer ; and so on up to Stinnes and Thyssen and the other steel kings who had given him both money and arms and set him up in his business of conquering first Germany and then the rest of Europe . To a Fiihrer on the make the grandson of Budd Gunmakers had seemed a likely prospect ; he was eager and alert , as well as polite and friendly . And then he had married Irma Barnes , heiress of twenty-three million dollars , so reported in the press . He brought her to visit Berchtesgaden , and Irma had listened to the Fuhrer and declared outright , " I agree with every word you have said . " Lanny did n't go that far , but had played the Moonlight Sonata for the Fiihrer , and admired his taste in paintings , and been entirely agreeable company . When Lanny 's old friend and employer , Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural than that he should tell Roosevelt about it , and that Roosevelt should propose that Lanny become a presidential agent , and bring the information to him ? Laurel asked if he would be willing to do the same thing for Truman , and he told her no . He wanted to be a normal man for a while and say what he really thought . " I have a sort of psychosis on the subject of secrecy , " he declared . " I ca n't bear to talk about what I have done , and I have a shrinking from any sort of publicity . "  |p255Said  the wife with a smile , " Wait till you start spending Emily 's million dollars ! " They were driven to Unterstein . The Karinhall art works , so many of which Lanny had learned to know and to love , had been spread out in the forty rooms of the rest house . The colonel in charge of the outfit on duty had the bright idea of diverting the minds of his troops by getting up an exhibition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys were all keyed to the war , and now they have a let-down feeling ; they do n't know what to do with themselves . " Laurel exchangedan amused glance with her husband ; it was just what he had said about himself . An art expert who was the stepson of a famous painter and had helped to get up art shows was the right person to be called upon . So husband and wife inspected the treasures and tagged those which they thought most likely to raise the cultural level of farm boys from the southern tip of Florida to the northern tip of Washington and points in between . It involved much shifting and carrying of paintings in heavy frames , and some conversation with the GIs who performed this labor  --  no gnomes from the salt mines here ! In the course of this experience an assimilated colonel and an assimilatedlady captain came upon a curious discovery concerning the standards of propriety that prevailed in their native land . Castles and palaces , elegant furniture and gorgeous costumes , armor and weapons , lace and furs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to by way of the movies , and especially since the technicolordays . As for naked men , one saw plenty of those in the Army ; hut if ever you had seen naked women , it was at some place you did not mention in the presence of ladies . If you saw pictures of such , they were the " feelthy postcards " which were an industry in Europe , or in magazines which you called " cheesecake " and kept hidden from your mothers and sisters . But here in this Goring collection of paintings was a sort of explosionof nakedness ; the taste of the fat man had run to the buxom fleshiness of Rubens and the Flemish school and the delicate and graceful sensuality of Raphael and the other Florentines . There were even some that Lanny himself would have considered prurient , such as two panels by Boucher showing the rustic maidens of Marie An- toinette 's France submitting to the amorous advances of elegant courtiers . And boys from the very proper South and the Puritan Middle West had to carry these paintings about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military superiors , stood and discussed them from a strictly esthetic point of view . The GIs would stand silentand embarrassed , and if they were asked a question they would blush to the roots of their hair . When they were among themselves they called the Monuments crew " the Venus fixers . " One amusing episode : there was a lifesize statue of the Magdalene , beautifully carved in fine wood and poly chromed some four hundred years ago . Her bosom was covered by a flood of blond hair , but there was nothing to cover the rest of her . It happened that her features were identical with those of Emmy Sonnemann , German stage star who had become Goring 's wife , and whose picture had been widely published in newspapers and magazines both German and American . Just recently she had been arrested with her husband , and again more pictures ; so now all the GIs at Unterstein took to calling the statue " Emmy . " They put her in the entrance hall , and that night when a cold wind was blowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had put his overcoat over the figure . Lanny warned him , " You may get into trouble , soldier . You know you are forbidden to touch any of the art works . " " Sorry , Doc , " said the man  --  he was young and really looked innocent . " I did n't mean to break the regulations , but I thought that Emmy looked chilly . " From the rest house you could gaze across the valley to the Obersalzberg , site of the Berghof , and far above it , the top of the Kehlstein , where Hitler had built his solitary eyrie . It was a sight not to be missed , and Lanny borrowed a car and an Army driver who knew the road . Lanny himself had been taken there by the Fuhrer , one of the two or three foreigners who had had that honor . It was perched right on the top of a mountain , built of stone hewed out in leveling the site . The road to it was terrific ; in the village Lanny had recently been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several years . There were three tunnels on the way . Laurel held her breath and wished she had n't started , but there was no way to turn until you got to the end of the road , where there was a turnaround for cars and a parking space.  |p257You  left the car and entered the mountain by a tunnel with bronze doors . The American Army was on guard , and had put up a sign to the effect that the elevator was for field-grade officers only ; that meant majors and those of higher rank , but nobody objected when a colonel took a captain , his wife . You went up seven hundred feet through solid rock , and when you came out there was a dwelling with all the comforts of home , though it looked like a fort . On the second floor was an immense eight-sided room , with windows so that you could look out over Germany , Austria , and Italy . Here this mountain-loving man had come to commune with his dreams of a Thousand-Year Reich and everlasting fame . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend and revealed his belief that there was recorded in the entire world 's history only one man as great as Adi Schicklgruber , the onetime wastrel from a home for the shelterless in Vienna . That other great one was the camel driver Mohammed , who had known how to found a religion and make it stick for thirteen centuries . Adi was out to break that record , so he declared . Hermann der Dicke had been taken to Augsburg , and Emmynotthe wooden but the real one  --  came to stay with her South Americanfriend in the castle at Zell am See . Lanny went there with a T-force  --  one car and a " pickup "  --  to look for paintings . The Monumentsasked him to take charge of the operation , since he knew her , and they did n't want any scenes with a woman . The chatelaine of Karinhallhad always been cordial to the elegant son of Budd-Erling , and once Robbie had warned his son not to be too cordial to her . Now she did her actress-best to be pathetic and touching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those paintings were her personal property and were all that stood between her and outright starvation , herself and her little girl , so sweet and innocent . She produced the little one , now seven years old , and the little one wept with her mother , having been frightened by the strange events of the last two weeks . Lanny played a mean trick upon this former First Lady of Naziland . ( She had been that because Hitler was supposed to have been a bachelorand a virgin . ) Lanny said to her what all the Nazis had been saying to him , up and down and across Germany , " I am sorry , and very much embarrassed , but you must know I can not help it ; I am merely carrying out orders ; I am an employee of the Army and havep258no say in the matter . " So she produced fifteen paintings , enormously valuable , of the Flemish school of five hundred years ago ; they had been taken from the famous Renders collection in Brussels . Lanny appreciated them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And now the rest , gnadige Frail . " She protested that that was all , and they had a quite ugly scene . He did n't really know , but he felt sure that she would not give up everythingat the first try . She broke down and wept hysterically , and Lanny ordered the GIs to search the castle . Thereupon the child 's nurse went without a word to a closet in the room and from behind a lot of clothing drew forth a lightly framed canvas about two and a half feet square and handed it to Lanny . He took one glance , and his heart gave a jump ; it was Goring 's famed " Vermeer , " which he had shown to Lanny at Karinhall and for which he had traded a hundred and thirty-seven other paintings , valued at more than a million and a half guilders . Lanny said nothing but took it out and saw it packed carefully . Back at Unterstein he placed it before the Monuments men , and right away there started that controversy which had shaken all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome and genial director of San Francisco 's municipal art museum ; he was vehement in calling the work a fraud . " Look at the flat greens and blues and the lack of subtlety in the modeling of the flesh tones ! It lacks that total visual effect which Vermeer so completely mastered . " Lanny , who did n't feel so sure , pointed out that half the authorities in Holland , Vermeer'snative land , had pronounced the work genuine . At Karinhall Lanny had of course said the same thing ; he might have ruined his career as a P.A. if he had done otherwise . The painting , called " Christ and the Adulteress , " showed a half figure of a beardless Jesus , with hair falling over both shoulders . The woman taken in adultery , a subject eternally popular with painters , stood before him in profile , with head bowed and eyes cast down ; two angry Jews stood behind the Christ , they being the ones who were ready to stone her . The painting would be taken back to Amsterdam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an obscure Dutch painter named van Meegeren , who had made a fortuneout of painting and then " discovering " a number of " Vermeers "  --  a seventeenth-century old master whose known works were very scarce . Even when van Meegeren confessed , many of the authorities would refuse to accept his story , and he would have to do yet one more " Vermeer " in prison before they would give up.  |p259Next  came a trip to Salzburg , and beyond it to Lake Fuschl , where the most odious of champagne salesmen in all Europe had a castle full of art works . What fun it had been to send armies into a foreign land and take possession of everything ; to set yourself up in somebody else 's castle on the shore of a blue Alpine lake , in the shadow of mountains covered with fir trees , and then proceed to fill the establishment with the lovely and beautiful things that you and your agents could find in Austria , Poland , and Czechoslovakia , France , Holland , and Belgium ! It had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Rome , and some people had naively assumed that it was over for good  --  but Joachim von Ribbentrop had shown them , and now the armies had shown him ! His castle had become a recreation ground for American troops , and a string of Army trucks came and carted the treasures off to the Munich collecting point . After watching this operation , Lanny and his wife were driven back to Salzburg on a mild spring evening , a full moon lighting their way . They stopped in this small mountain city with the foaming river through the middle of it . This " Salt Castle 's " name was famous all over the world because of the music festival that had been held here every summer . Adi Schicklgruber had changed it into one of his Kraft dutch Freude festivals ; he was not keen for internationalism , and especially not the kind that gave jobs to Jewish musicians and conductors . Sitting in the familiar Mirabell Gardens , having supper , Lanny told his wife what this place had meant to him . In the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his first marriage had come to an end . Irma had quarreled with him because of his ideas and associates , and when he had put her in the position of having to help Trudi Schultz escape from Germany , that had been the last straw ; at the railway station of Hallein she had said good-by to him and gone back to her mother on Long Island . So then , feeling very desolate , he had driven up to Salzburg . ( Those wonderful days when you could have a car of your own , and purchasefuel for it in any town or village ! ) Lanny had tried to drown his sorrows in music ; and , sitting in these pleasant gardens , he had found himself in the company of another sorrow-smitten gentleman , who had poured out his domestic troubles to an entire stranger . Lanny had n't reciprocated ; but now he remarked to Laurel that he often wondered whether the ruling-class reticence which had been impressed upon him since childhood was n't really a great strain upon the emotional life . The music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramas ; and after each performance the crowds had emerged , everybodyexcited and pouring out volumes of art gossip , more about the artists than about the works they performed . He had boarded for a couple of weeks with the family of a civic official  --  everybody took " paying guests " for the festival and lived the rest of the year on the proceeds . Here again were people who vented their emotions freely , and the sixteen-year-old daughter of the family had fallen head over heels in love with a cultivated and wealthy American gentleman , who was greatly embarrassed . He had escaped with his conscience intact  --  otherwise he surely would n't have been telling the story to his wife . He could tell her everything except the physical dangers , which would have frightened her . THIS art-loving couple were having a pleasant holiday , living in Europe 's central playground and having a couple of million young American males to keep them safe and comfortable . The war had ended  --  " just like that , " instantly , really unbelievably . The Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russians in Czechoslovakia , but that was all . There was n't any Alpine Redoubt , there were n't any " werewolves , " and if there was a Nazi underground it dug in so deep that nobody knew about it . All the Germans suddenly became willing and obliging ; a large part of them became anti-Nazi , and the rest non-Nazi , all at a few strokes of a pen in the hands of an admiral , a general , and an Air Force commander . The old Germany had come back to life , and it was safe to go walking , to go driving , to go into any German 's home , or what wasp261left of it , and ask him or her how things were and how they had been during the past six years . Back in America were millions of people curious about such details , and a practiced woman writer could sell all the copy she could turn out . As for an art expert , he could n't do business yet , but he could inspect and discuss and come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as the harriers against trade were lifted . Lanny recalled the half-dozen Detaze landscapes in the villa called " Bechstein Haus " on the Berghof estate . He had sold them to the Fuhrer at a proper price , so he had no claim upon them ; but who did ? Hitler was dead , or said to be , and surely his property should be in the hands of the American Army until such a time as the question was decided . Lanny led another task force , consisting of a car and a jeep , and took Laurel along because the Berghof would be " copy "  --  and also because she had a special and personal interest in this ogre 's den . The once lovely chalet was a pitiful sight . It had been hit several times by six-ton bombs , and a few days later the SS had set fire to it on the approach of the American Seventh Army . Both its elaborate wings had been reduced to ashes , and the central part , which had contained the immense square living-room and Hitler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world " looking out over Austria  --  all that was burned-out shell . The GIs who stood guard reported that everyone who came to the site carried off a souvenir , and Laurel chose a bronze doorknob which she found in the ashes . She remarked that perhaps it was the one under which she had propped a chair to keep the door shut tight  --  there were no locks on any room in that strange establishment . It had been a true ogre 's castle to an American woman guest ; it was the first and only time that a man had ever laid forcible hands upon her , and the experience was one never to be forgotten . The barracks where the SS guards had lived had been spared , and were useful to the Americans . ( In the last days of the war General Eisenhower had issued an order against the bombing of any barracks , because they would be needed , and they were . ) The Bechstein Haus still stood , and the lovely Detaze paintings were where Hitler had ordered them hung . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of ruins in Greece . Each was a separate story for Lanny , who had watched them being painted and knew the places they represented . He had told his wife many stories of this gentle-minded Frenchman who had been Beauty 's lover for ten years or more , andp262whom she had married when he had got his dreadful wounds in World War I.Marcel Detaze had been a French representational painter whom the Fuhrer could tolerate . He had ordered these examples because he wanted to honor the French and make friends with them , so that they would trust him and let him take Poland ; also , perhaps , because he wanted to bribe the reluctant Herr Budd and bind him to the Nazi cause . Marcel would have loathed Hitler beyond all the French bad language that he knew . He had painted awful caricatures of the Germans  --  but apparently the Fuhrer 's agents in Paris had failed to inform him of that fact . Now the American government would turn these landscapes over to the French government , and they would be hung in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lanny had subscribed to a newspaper in Paris , and there was a radio set in the Unterstein rest house , where he and his wife were privileged to listen to broadcasts from Paris and London , and from a station which the Americans were using in Luxembourg . So the pair followed the fates of those evil persons whom they had hated and feared through so many years . Quisling was in jail in Norway , weeping and raging by turns . Edward Waiter , director of the horrorsof Dachau , had fled to the chateau which was part of the prison system , and there put a bullet through his heart ; when that did n't kill him quickly enough he put another through his eye . Max Amann , head of the publishing house which printed Hitler 's works and paid him his fortune , poisoned himself , and so did Frau Gertrude ScholtzKlink , head of the Nazi women 's movement . From that ardent soul at the outbreak of the war had come a proclamation : " Dear Fuhrer , we German women give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with as you wish . " Adi had taken them ! And now came the news about Heinrich Himmler , most sought of all the party survivors . An odd turn of the wheel of fate ; this most mild-mannered of fanatics , head of the SS and the Gestapo , had driven Lanny Budd into secret flight with false papers and a disguise , and now the tables were turned and it was Heinrich who was fleeing under the same circumstances . Only two differences between the cases : Lanny had fled southward while Himmler fled westward , and Lanny had succeeded while Himmler failed . Two British soldiers guard/ing a bridge at Bremerworde , west of Hamburg , stopped three men in civilian clothing who were trying to pass . The leader was a shortish , smooth-faced man wearing thick horn-rimmed glasses and a patch over one eye ; he had perfectly good papers and a pass identifying him as Herr Hitzinger , member of the German Field Security Police . His papers were too good , for in these days of turmoil few refugeeshad any papers whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security Police , and after a grilling the gentle Heinrich admitted who he was . He was searched , and protested against the indignity  --  he who had had so many millions of people searched , all over Europe ! The British doctor ordered him to open his mouth , and he did so , and rolled his tongue around his teeth to show that his mouth was empty . But the doctor was n't satisfied and put his finger into the mouth , whereupon the man clamped his teeth down and broke a tiny capsule of cyanide which he had hidden there . He fell , and for a few minutes slobbered into a tin basin , and then was dead . The British put him into what they call a " lorry " and carried him out into the woods . They had no coffin , and did n't waste even that much wood on him ; they dug a deep hole and dropped the body in . " A worm to the worms , " said the British sergeant , and they shoveled in the earth and carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would be no martyr 's bones for the SS to cherish . These tidings were important to Lanny for a special reason : they took from his mind one more faint hope that he might find out somethingregarding his half-sister . The ex-Reichsminister might have been willing to tell him if he remembered the case . The only other chance would be the Gestapo records in Berlin . Millions of displaced personsand other millions of German refugees were all over this tormentedland , and who was going to remember anything about a Franco-American night-club dancer who had been the mistress of a Junker officer and had disappeared from public view when places of entertainment had been closed some three years ago ? No , he might as well give it up , write his mother to give it up , and say that Marceline was dead . He had just about decided on this , and composed in his mind a letter to Beauty , when there came to Untersteina letter for him , forwarded by Monuments in Paris . It was from Bernhardt Monck and had been mailed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The censor permits me to tell you where I am , and that I have resumed my own name . You can reach me in care of G-2 of First Army Headquarters here . You told me about your sister , and I promised to make inquiries wherever I saw a chance . I have come upon the following case , which I think may be worth reporting to you : " A woman was found in the women 's hospital of the Leipzig Concentration Camp . She was one of a thousand or so who had been working twelve-hour shifts in a near-by munitions factory . She was wearing a canvas skirt and jacket , nothing else , and no identification marks of any sort . I am guessing that she is young , but it is hard to be sure . She had been through the torture mill ; all her teeth have been knocked out , her back and legs are a mass of welts which the doctors say have been there for some time , and her finger ends show scars of fire , probably caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from complete amnesia ; she does not know who she is or where she came from . She answers everything about her past with I do not know . ' When let alone , she sits perfectly still , and cowers when she is approached . Her eyes and hair are brown , the hair with some gray . She has a strawberry mark on her left leg ; no other peculiarity that I can see . She is about five feet seven , and is fearfully emaciated , but not beyond the point where she can be restored . If these details correspond to your sister , you might come and have a look at her . If you are too far away , or if it is not convenient , I will arrange to get a photo for you . She goes by the name Martha and the number Fi 147 . " The sights in this place exceed anything that even I imagined , and I had thought I knew the Nazis after almost twenty-five years of keeping out of their clutches . For your sake I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already found her , and if so this letter will not trouble you . If I have to leave here I will give a forwarding address . As ever , Bernhardt Monck . " Lanny read that letter with a sinking heart . One sentence struck him like a blow : the strawberry mark ! He had seen Marceline 's a thousand times , for they had worn bathing suits a good part of the time at Bienvenu . As a toddler she had learned dancing steps from him , wearing nothing but a tiny pair of trunks ; the strawberry mark had been there and had grown with her , and he had teased her about it.  |p265He  had had every opportunity to watch that lovely body growing ; she had added to the bathing trunks only a brassiere  --  no more was called for on the Coast of Pleasure . They had practiced dancing steps by the hour ; she was tireless , and her vigor and grace had been a marvel to him . After she divorced her Italian capitano and had made up her mind to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehearse with her . And now the fiends had knocked all the teeth out of her jaws ; they had poked burning matches under her finger nails and lashed her back bloody with steel whips . He took the letter to Laurel , saying , " This is Marceline . " She read it and then sat gazing at him , speechless for a while . " Oh , Lanny , how awful ! How awful ! " she whispered at last . " They must have been trying to make her tell about me , " he said . " And she would n't ! " " She could n't even if she had wanted to . She had warned me to get out of Germany , but she had no idea how I would do it . I did n't know myself until I had time to think it over . " " You must n't torture yourself over this , Lanny . You could n't have helped it . And it may not be Marceline . " " It is hardly possible that there could be such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she may have sought refuge there . It is even possible that she may have been there when she telephoned me the warning . " " You must go and make sure about her of course . " " She may not recognize me . Her amnesia is a retreat from pain and terror . " " What will you do if it is Marceline ? " " It depends upon her condition . If she is able to be moved I must get her hack to Bienvenu . This will be no new story to Beauty . " He did n't need to explain what he meant , for Laurel knew all the details of the story of Marcel Detaze , how he had had his face burned off in the exploding of an observation balloon , and how Beauty had stuck to him through it all . She had married him , in spite of his having to wear a silk mask over his face . Marceline had been the fruit of that marriage . " Can you spare me that long , dear ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Of course , " she answered . " I would come with you if I could be of any use . But I am not much more than a name to Marceline , and it is possible that in her subconscious mind she resents my having taken her beloved brother away from her . "  | " I do n't think that , " he said . " She had her own affairs and was quite cold-blooded about going after what she wanted . She never asked my advice except in matters of art and how to meet rich people who would take an interest in her dancing . " " But she stood by you in Germany , Lanny ! " " Of course , and I have to stand by her . It will be painful , and there 's nothing you can do to make it less so . I am guessing that what she needs is psychological care , and the person to give it is Parsifal . He knows her and loves her , and can give her suggestions all day and half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your material ; then come to Juan to do your writing , where you can be warm . " Lanny packed his bag and got himself transported to Munich . At , the dusty airport it did n't take him long to find a pilot who was flying to Berlin and could get permission to drop an assimilated colonel off at Leipzig . The trip was a couple of hundred miles and took only an hour . He looked down on another bombed-out city , and when he got a jeep to run him into town he saw the familiar sight of tall , crowded buildings , which had stood for a couple of hundred years , turned to rubble and , where it blocked the streets , being shoveled into trucks . The British had done what was called " area bombing , " coming by night and hitting anything ; the Americans had come by day , and had boasted that they could drop a bomb into a barrel  --  but many times , aiming at a factory , they had leveled five- and sixstorytenements or rows of barrack-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army , but he had his credentials and his pitiful story . Intelligence here knew Bernhardt Monck and valued him ; they gave Lanny the requisite permit and a car to take him to the Lager , which was far in the suburbs , so that residents of this ancient and honorable city might not be bothered by the stink . Leipzig had been the center of the German publishing industry , and from it had come the seven million copies of Mein Kamp f which so many Germans had taken for their national and racial Bible . Now you would have had a hard time finding any man or woman who would admit having read it through ; you would be tempted to believe them , since no book less readable had been published in the modem world.  |p267All  the Lagern were alike ; they had been brought into being on a mass-production basis , and when you had seen Dachau , the prototype , you had seen them all . At Leipzig the American Army had had about six weeks to clean up ; there were no longer cordwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stinks were reduced in intensity . The hospital was clean , and the German doctors no longer tried " scientific " experiments on the patients but worked under American direction to restore blood and tissue to nearly starved bodies . The patients were getting orange juice made from canned powder , and canned milk diluted , and broth and gruel , and when they were able to walk and to digest solid food they were turned loose if they wanted to go . But many had no place to go to and were terrified by the thought of confronting a world in which they no longer had relatives or friends or homes . Millions of the homes had been destroyed , and millions of families had been scattered over the face of Europe , so that parents had no way to find children and children no way to find parents . Here , in a place that was the same as a barracks except that the bunks were not in tiers , Lanny found his half-sister . It was Marceline beyond question , in spite of the dreadful changes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way  --  when he stood on the Rhine bridge between Kehl and Strasbourg and took from the hands of Nazi stormtroopers the broken body of Freddi Robin . That had been twelve years ago , but he had never forgotten the pangs , and never would he forget these . Marceline was a woman , twenty-eight years old by the calendar , and something of an artist ; Freddi had been two years younger at the time ; a scholar , musician , and idealist , almost a saint . For which of them would you feel the greater grief ? This woman was one of the near-skeletons ; her jaws were sunken , her hair unkempt and streaked with gray , her eyes full of fear . She did n't know Lanny , and for a long time she manifested no interest in him . She was well enough to move about , but apparently all she wanted was to sit in a corner and be let alone . She had been working twelve hours every day filling cases of small-caliber artillery shells , and the doctors had thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a woman teach her to knit . That was all right with the patient ; they had given her a sock for a model , and now she turned out socks with machine-like regularity . She was afraid of new persons who came near her , and it was some time before she could be convinced that her half-brother was not another torturer . He told the doctors who she was , and told them her story as far as he knew it . They said it was a familiar case ; they had others here . They used long technical words , as doctors do ; the substance of it was that her personality had retreated from unendurable suffering and had sought refuge deep in her subconsciousness . Perhaps it was the last dreadful climax that had caused it . When the American Army had drawn near , the infuriated SS had locked all the doors of the men 's hospital and set fire to it . The building was just across the street from the women 's , and they had heard the screams of the men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the halfburnedmen had managed to crawl out of the building and into the women 's hospital . Marceline had fled into the typhoid ward , where nearly three hundred women were huddled , expecting the same fate , as the men ; she had been found hidden under a bunk  --  and perhaps that was where her sense of identity had taken flight . Lanny sent telegrams to Laurel , to Beauty , and to Robbie , telling what he had found . Then he settled down , patiently and tenderly , to try to bring back his half-sister 's memory . He told her who she was , but the name meant nothing to her . He told her about her mother , her stepfather , her little boy , and the home where she had been raised ; she had no trace of recollection and seemed not to want to have any ; she resisted the disclosures , as if they were an attack . He thought it the part of wisdom not to mention Oskar von Herzenberg , or her dancing , or anything that had happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears . Better to go back to her childhood , to memories that meant peace and joy . But nothing made any difference that he could observe . Marceline wanted to remain Martha Fi147 . They were feeding her every two hours on limited quantities of liquid foods ; he arranged that he should perform this service , and while she ate he sat and talked to her gently . She had to be re-educated , as if she were a child . He explained to her that the cruel war was over , that the evil Nazis were gone and had no possibility of returning ; she was in the hands of people who loved her and would never do her harm . He tried his best to interest her in the strange idea that she had a mother , and a lovely little dark-eyed half-Italian son , and a beautiful home on the Cap d'Antibes , in a country called France . That country meant nothing to her.  |p269She  would sit and knit with her half-crippled fingers  --  better not to look at them , or you would want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shoot them . He managed to make friends with her , so that she accepted his statement that he was her half-brother ; but he failed to awaken a single memory . She was hungry and ate her food , and that was a sign of life ; for the rest , she did what he told her , or what anybody told her . If they said " You should sleep now , " she would lie down and sleep . If they said " Come with me , " she would come . It was the well-known German Ordnung and Zucht ! In the evenings he went out and looked up Bernhardt Monck , who had been away on a mission and now had returned . For the first time since war had come , these two men were able to talk frankly to each other . One of the strictest rules which OSS and other secret agents had to keep was against telling anybody anything that did n't have to be told . What any agent knew might be wrung out of him by torture , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy to get . This pair had made contacts a dozen times during the war , and each time had strictly obeyed the rule . Monck , stationed in Stockholm , had given Lanny the name of a faithful German Social Democrat , an old watchmaker , and it was he who had put Lanny in touch with the underground which had passed him part of the way to Italy . Now Lanny could tell Monck about Johann Seidl and ask what had become of him . Monck did n't know , for he had n't been to Berlin ; it was the " Russkys " who had taken the city , and Americans went there only on official missions . He wanted to know if Lanny thought that Hitler was really dead , and Lanny told about his interview with Goring and what the old-style robber baron had said on the subject . Of course you could n't know what Goring really thought . Two veterans back from the wars , fighting their battles over again ! Monck owed his position in the OSS to Lanny 's endorsement , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a superior . He had reason to be proud of the work he had done . In collaboration with Eric Erickson , Swedish oil man secretly in sympathy with America , Monck had been in charge of collecting information concerning the syntheticoil plants of Germany , their location and condition before and after bombing . The destruction of these plants had had as much to do with bringing the war to an end as any one thing a man couldp270put his finger on . A year ago General Spaatz , Air Force commander , had cabled the order : " Primary strategic aim of U. S. Strategic Air Forces is now to deny oil to enemy air forces . " From then on oil plants were top priority targets and were dealt with under the familiarsystem : put them out of use , wait until they were repaired , and then smash them again . Monck , in Stockholm , had had some thirty agents , men and women , working under his command in Germany , and only four of them had been lost . They had reported on eighty-seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten months of the war General Spaatz 's airmenhad dropped nearly two hundred thousand tons of bombs on or near those targets . When he had started the war Hitler had had on hand only two or three months ' supply of oil , but he had made tremendousefforts to increase his supply and had succeeded for five years , as all the world knew . Synthetic oil was the answer , and by what was known as the Karinhall Plan he had raised Germany 's oil production to eight million tons per year . Listening to Monck 's story , Lanny realized that this had been an oil war . Lack of oil was the reason the mad Fuhrer had had to drop his program of bombing Britain out of the war and to fall back upon a defensive program . He had made the mistake of building too many of his plants in the west and had to build new ones in Silesia and Poland . The plants were the most secret places in Germany , the most carefully camouflaged and most heavily defended . Vital machinery was put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest , and every plant was surrounded with smoke screens , searchlights , and solid rings of anti-aircraft batteries . This had been a lifeor-deathwar for the Nazis , and they had all known it . " We got the information , " Monck said quietly , and went on to tell the story of the tremendous Leuna works near this city of Leipzig . The plant had produced more than one-third of all Germany 's aviation and motor gasoline , and during the last year there had been twenty-two knockout air raids upon it . The first , on May 12 , 1944 , had dropped five hundred tons of bombs and stopped production entirely . But the Germans had their plans to restore full production in a month  --  " We got a copy of those plans , " said Monck ; " I had them in my own hands a week after the raid . " So the bombers had come again in sixteen days , and this war betweendestroyers and repairers went on for the full year . At the end of July , after the landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning , the Leunawerke was hit by nearlyp271three thousand tons of bombs in two days . There had been an attack every fortnight , and nine total knockouts of production . " I have just been looking over the records , " reported the secret agent . " Our bombs caused more than five thousand breaks in pipe-lines at Leuna , and every one of those had to be repaired and fully tested before they could carry the highly inflammable gases and liquids . In the end we had the Nazis reduced to building little plants in the forests , like what you call moonlight stills in America . " " Moonshine , " corrected Lanny with a smile . " I was told about one in the Black Forest that was run by the power of a steam locomotive . I saw tanks and armored vehicles that had been hauled into the Ardennesby horses and oxen ; and they did n't get out again . Also , there were Tiger tanks that had been fitted with gas generators , to burn charcoal . " Said Monck , " That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and why the Fiihrer shot himself , and Goebbels and Himmlertook poison . " Lanny went back in his memory to the books he had read on the subject of psychology . That had been a decade and a half ago , when his stepfather had discovered a spiritualist medium in a tenement on Sixth Avenue in New York , and had become excited about the subject of psychic research . For years after that he had experimented and read the best books he could find . This included several on hypnotism , a powerful weapon which the doctors of an earlier generationhad taken seriously but which had dropped out of use , apparentlybecause it took too much time and trouble . Lanny had the time now and was willing to take the trouble . He arranged to take Marceline into a quiet room and seated her in a chair and tried every way he knew to hypnotize her . He told her to gaze into his eyes , but he found it impossible to fix her attention ; she was uneasy and afraid , and her eyes would wander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , but encountered the same difficulty . No one can be hypnotized without his or her consent , and he could get no real consent from this shell-shocked mind . The very fears which he was seeking to heal prevented any approach to the healing . He decided that a new environment might solve the problem , and when she was physically strong enough to be moved he wangled per/mission for a flight to Paris ; that took only about three hours and was not too great a strain . He knew that the hospitals would be crowded , but he got a hotel suite and a nurse to watch over her while he went about the business of begging another plane ride , this time to Cannes . No private motorcar could get gasoline for such a trip , and the trains were slow and irregular and packed to the very platform steps . Lanny judged that neither Monuments nor Alsos would be able to help him in a case like this . He went to OSS , a privileged institution , of which few questions were asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be necessary to appeal to one of the high brass , and whom did Lanny know here in Paris ? When he said that he had served in both the Third and the Seventh , they mentioned that General Patton was in town . Lanny said , " He 's the man ! " No trouble for an assimilated colonel to see Georgie , especially when it had been Lucky Forward which had done the assimilating . They were on terms of banter , for when they had first met the son of Budd-Erling had presumed to tell Georgie it was his duty to take Paris at once , and Georgie had been as mad as hops , and then had had a second thought about it . Now the old boy was sitting on top of this world , but perhaps a trifle bored , there being no longer any new worlds to be conquered . His troubles were far from over , because his Army had been picked to serve as occupation troops , and he and all of his officers were begging to get to Japan . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was why he had come to Paris now . He looked old and tired , and Lanny could guess that the strain of the past three or four years had done something to his kidneys . But he stood tall and straight , in a tight-fitting battle jacket with shiny brass buttons and four silver stars on each of his shoulders , and four on each side of his shirt collar ; he wore trousers creased to a knife edge and tucked into polished battle boots . He still wore the two pearl-handled revolvers and the swashbuckler 's air , which his high squeaky voice somewhat oddly belied . " Well , Budd , " he said , " what 's biting you now ? " " General , " said Lanny , " you know the services I rendered at Bastogne . And Colonel Koch has twice thanked me for help I gave him , once at Nancy and once at Luxembourg . Now I am asking a favor in return . "  |p273Georgie  signed him to a chair , then said , " Shoot ! " " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French painter Marcel Detaze . She is twenty-eight , and was a professionaldancer . She was caught in Germany . Not quite two years ago I was in Berlin , on a special Intelligence mission for President Roosevelt . Marceline found out that the Nazis had got onto me and risked her life to telephone me to get out , which I did . The scoundrels must have caught her and tried to make her reveal my whereabouts ; they knocked out all her teeth , they stuck matches under her fingernails , and they whipped her till her back looks like a washboard . I found her in the Leipzig Lager ; they had been working her twelve hours a day in an underground munitions plant . She is a victim of amnesia and does n't know who she is or anything about herself . " " The goddam SOBs ! " exclaimed Georgie . He used cavalryman 's language so freely that when he was really mad he had no way to show it but in his face and with the clenching of his hands . " What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as Paris . I want to take her to our mother , at our home on the Cap d'Antibes . Marceline was born and brought up there , and I have hopes that the familiar scenes may bring her memory back . She has been starved to less than a hundred pounds and she could n't stand a train trip . I want to fly her to Cannes . I 'm not asking for a special plane ; I just want a couple of seats on any plane that 's flying there , and I 'm perfectly willing to pay transporta-tion . " " Nonsense , man ; the Army is n't that hard up . I 'm glad you came to me . I 'll have one of my staff men see that it is arranged . " He added , " Never mind the thanks , it 's the Army . " He leaned back in his chair and beamed . " Well , we licked the goddam bastards ! " " You did , General , " said Lanny , who knew the right way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come pouring in to give up . I was in the heart of what was going to be their Redoubt , and I had a hard time keeping them from surrendering to me . " " We would n't have minded your having a few . We took more than a million and a quarter . " " You 'll be interested to know that I had a talk with Goring the night after he came in . " " That bundle of hogsfat ! Tell me about him . " Lanny told that story ; then he told how he had become **27;3851;TOOLONG of Urach , and Georgie chuckled . The ex-P.A. knew better than to continue with his own exploits ;  | he asked the two-gun General what had been happening to him , and the squeaky voice turned loose on the " old women at SHAEF , " who had been so timid they would n't let him win the war last winter ; at the very end they would n't let him go into Czechoslovakia for fear of displeasing the Russians , and they almost would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did was that it was part of the Redoubt and they were afraid the blankety-blanks might hole up there . And now they had turned down his request to be sent to the Pacific . All because of jealousy at headquarters ! When they were parting the tired man said , " My work is done , Budd . The Lord can take me any time . " Lanny remembered the words , and thought of them a few months later when he heard over the radio that the commander of the Third Army had been killed in a motorcar crash . Lanny succeeded in telephoning his mother to tell her that he was coming . The flight from Paris was without incident , and at the landingfield there was Beauty herself with a horse and buggy . The formerwas experienced and sedate , and the latter had stood in a shed on the estate since the days before motorcars had been invented ; they had n't even been able to get paint for it until Robbie had mailed them a can from Newcastle . The fine car that Beauty had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what had happened to it they would never know . Lanny had said over the telephone , " Do n't kiss her , for that may frighten her . Do n't show any emotion , just be gentle and quiet . " So Beauty blinked the tears out of her eyes  --  she had been prepared , but the reality was beyond imagining . She drove , and Marceline was helped into the seat beside her , and then Lanny climbed in beside Marceline . There was n't enough of her to crowd them . The nag ambled along , and it took them nearly an hour to get to Bienvenu , a drive which they had been accustomed to make by car in six or seven minutes . They talked about the beautiful day , the wide spacious Boulevard de la Croisette with its rows of palm trees , the blue waters of the Golfe Juan , the swarms of GIs filling all the fashionablehotels , the buildings which had been damaged and were now nearly all repaired . Topics like that , harmless , and likely to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word . She had been told that this was her mother , but the statement meant nothingp275to her , and if she had ever swum in these blue waters or sailed over them she did not know or care . It was the same with the white-haired old gentleman of seventy and the dark-haired little boy of seven . The strange situation had been made known to the child ; his mother , of whom he had no recollection , had lost her recollection of him ; he must be gentle and quiet with her and help her get well . Since he was gentle and quiet by nature , this was not difficult . He took seriously his duties as assistant nurse . He had been impressed by the information that she had been almost starved to death and that food would help to restore her to a more agreeable aspect . He would sit and watch every spoonful that she put into her mouth . For Parsifal Dingle this was a situation made to order . He was like the Catholic priests in Dachau : he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sick woman at once ; he was a man of God , and he wasted no time in preliminaries but took a seat before her and began to explain his faith . She , Marceline Detaze , was God 's perfect child , and all she had to do was to put her faith in Him , and He would restore her to peace and happiness . Parsifal did not undertake to explain why God had let her get into her present state , or why He had created , or permitted to come into existence , those fiends in human form who had brought her there . The problem of evil and how it comes to be is one which has baffled the world 's greatest philosophers , and what Parsifal Dingle did was to ignore it . God knew the answer , and perhaps in His good time would reveal it . What Parsifal had to do was to turn evil into good , a power which God gave him and for which he was duly grateful . So , day and night , he recited the prayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons and which now had become routine . Monotony did not trouble him , and the idea of boredom did not occur to him , for this was the presence of God . He did not tell God what to do , or even ask ; he told Marceline what God could and would do , because God was good and could do nothing else. le told her that God was the living Principle that had made her and sustained her , and if she had faith in this certainty the process of restoration would go on and she would have peace and health and happiness . He told her that God would cast out her fears if she would believe that He would do it . She , being docile , believed it , and it happened . A little boy sat by , listening and watching with his wide dark eyes , deeply stirred , because this was the first miracle he had seen . He was told that his presence was important , for Jesus had said ,  | " Where two or three are gathered together in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " Laurel came , having got all the material she needed , and being glad of a place where she could sit in the sun with a writing pad on her knee . Laurel had never been religious , but this was a new kind of religion , something which could be taken as psychology . If faith healed as Parsifal had insisted he had been proving for thirty years , was it not advisable for men and women to acquire some ? It was , the old gentleman insisted , something different from reason ; it was something that you proved by experiment . You had faith in peace and you had peace ; you had faith in health and you had health . Up to a certain point it worked admirably with Marceline . She was getting confidence and was restoring her starved tissues . In this household where only love was spoken she came to feel at home and accepted their statement that this was her family and the house in which she had been born and raised . She never went away from the house ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened seldom because transportation was so difficult to get . She would knit or she would do any household task that was set before her . Only now and then was there a relapse , as when a thunderstorm caused her to crawl under the bed and refuse to come out . Apparently God was not in the thunder . But no effort had any effect upon her memory ; no suggestion and no prayers could carry her back behind that curtain which had fallen in the Leipzig Lager . Lanny tried again and again to hypnotize her ; he was sure that if he could plant the suggestion that her memory would return it would happen . But his best efforts failed ; the fears still blocked the way . Then he bethought himself of an idea which had occurred to him many years ago , that it might be possible to implant suggestions during normal sleep ; he had tried several experiments , but the monotony had bored him  --  he lacked his stepfather 's firm conviction that God was speaking through his voice . But now , apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read an item to the effect that the Army was dealing with shell-shock cases by means of suggestion implanted by a phonograph record played while the patient slept . They had a deviceto make radio records audible under the pillows of airplane pilots in training , and when they woke up in the morning they knew theirp277lessons . If the Army was doing such things , that made them respectable . Lanny searched in the attic of this villa for a phonograph he had used in giving dance lessons to Marceline and young Freddi and other children . It had a device which shifted the needle and played the same record over and over as long as you wanted ; it was run by electricity , so that it could keep going all night . Lanny dusted it off and made sure it was in order ; then , with Parsifal 's help , he composed a spiel . He rode in a crowded bus to the city of Nice where there was a recordingstudio ; he had a twelve-inch recording made and tried out , and took it home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that it would not make her uneasy . After that she went to sleep every night to the sound of Lanny 's voice murmuring gently , and all night long it continued to murmur reassuring suggestions . " I am your brother , Lanny Budd , and I love you and want to help you . You will remember me , and how I taught you to swim and dance and play tennis . Beauty is your mother , and she loves you , and you will remember all the kind things she did for you . Your father was Marcel Detaze , and you will remember his beautifulpaintings . Little Marcel is your son ; you will remember how he was born and how happy you were with him . Parsifal is your other father ; he loves you , and you will remember how he taught you . Laurel is your sister , and she loves you too . Bienvenu is your home , and you will recall your childhood here and all your friends and the happy times you had . Everybody here loves you and wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember all your happiness ... " And so on and on . To have had a human voice repeating that for eight hours would have been a great strain upon the voice , but it did n't worry the phonograph a bit , and it did n't use up much of the scarce electrical power of the Midi . Nor did it trouble Marceline 's sleep ; she had been brought to the point where she wanted to remember these agreeable things that were told to her . Her past life had become a sort of fairy tale , to which she listened gladly and asked questions . After the treatment had continued for two or three weeks she began to exclaim , " I believe I remember that ! " How could they be sure ? They had told her much . But the day came when she cried : " Oh , I remember Vittorio ! He was such a horrid man ! " Then they knew that the suggestions were really taking effect , for they had agreed never to mention her divorced husband  --  he being one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from her past . Memories did not come in a rush , but little by little ; and perhaps that was just as well . She was getting back her interest in life , she was learning to live in this new-old world and be useful in it , much more so than she had been in the past , for she had been a self-centered person , ravenous for pleasure and praise . The day before Lanny and Laurel went away he tried a fascinating experiment . The radio was playing Tales of the Vienna Woods , and he took her hands and began to lead her gently into a waltz . The result was amazing ; she began to follow his steps , and a light of happiness came into her eyes . " Oh , I know how to dance ! " she exclaimed . And dance she did , with mounting delight , until her breath gave out and she had to sit down , panting . And how happy she was then ! What a marvelous discovery ! " I know a lot about dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be happy dancing ! " And so Lanny knew that she was cured . BOOK SIX'Tis Excellent to Have aGiant 's Strengthp281THE terrible World War had been shifted now to the Pacific ; the time had come for the Japanese to feel the weight of America 's power . The Philippines had been retaken after half a year of the toughest kind of fighting . The small island of Okinawa , close to Japan , had required nearly three months to capture ; a hundred and twenty thousandJapanese had been killed or driven to suicide , and only eight thousand captured  --  which showed the kind of war it was . This island was crucial because it immediately became a base for the big bombers ; they could make what the airmen called a " milk run " to the Japanese cities and do to them what had been done in Germany , destroying t heir oil and munitions-making centers . But Lanny knew no military man who believed that this fanatical enemy would give up until the homeland itself had been taken . He knew that armies were being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the invasion was set for November . Patton had told him that they were reckoning upon a million casualties , more than the British , French , and Americans had sustained in all the European fighting . A terrible prospect indeed , and one that weighed upon the consciences of two idealists dreaming peace on earth and good will toward men . Lanny found himself thinking continuously about his million dollars and what he was going to do with it . He talked about it with Laurel Whenever her mind was not on her own work . He decided that he had done all he could for the United States Army in Europe ; he had got all the information he could get for both Alsos and Monuments , and the rest was up to others . The scientists would study and appraise the documents ; the museum people would collect the works of art and transport them and classify them and deliver them to the owner countries , with banquets and ceremonies for which Lanny did n't especially care.  | The day came when Laurel said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write . From now on I want to give whatever power I possess to your project . " That was important indeed to Lanny ; it meant that for the first time his marriage and his job would be one and the same . One decision they had come to : this was not going to be a longtermjob . If anybody was going to prevent World War III , about which many of the big brass were speculating , it would have to be done soon , Lanny had decided that they would divide the money into five equal portions and spend one portion every year . Whatever seed they had to sow would be sown in that time ; when the harvest would be reaped was beyond guessing . Anyhow , they would n't establish a foundation and set up a group of chairwarmers for life . The next move was to England , to have things out with Rick and Nina . Transportation for a concentration-camp victim had been hard to get , but for Lanny and his wife it was a simple matter ; they were officers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were flown to Paris and from there to London ; they . went by train to The Reaches , Rick 's home in Buckinghamshire on the River Thames . Lanny had n't seen it for more than eight years . While he posed as a Nazi sympathizer , his meetings with a well-known Labour journalist had taken place in an obscure hotel room which one or the other would rent for the purpose . Nothing changes much in the English countryside . This old brick house had been added to at several periods in different styles ; it had many gables and dormer windows , and a chimney with a pot on top for every tier of rooms . In the old days that had meant a slavey carryingcoals and ashes all day in cold weather ; but now the slaveys were working at munitions , and most of the rooms had been left unused of late . There were few modern comforts , because the old baronet had spent all his money on " little theaters , " and since he had died Rick had spent his paying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path between a double row of oak trees led down to the river ; there was a boathouse , and a punt in which two boys had explored a historic waterway , meantime expressing firm convictionsabout all the problems of mankind . On the grassy banks of this river Lanny had sat in the evening , listening to Rick playing the piano in the house ; Rosemary Codwilliger  --  pronounced Culliver , please  --  had sat by his side , and a fourteen-year-old lad had felt the first touches of a magic wand . Rosemary had come to the Riviera one winter and had seduced him but refused to marry him , because she preferred to become a countess . Now she was a grandmother several times over , and Lanny went to see her  --  but only when she was hard up and had persuaded her husband to sell another of his ancestral portraits . Memories , memories ! Beauty Budd had come to the Henley Regatta , the boat race between Oxford and Cambridge ; all in pink , a lovely rose in full bloom , attended by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry him  --  but the young Lanny had begged her to stick to Marcel and stay what she called poor , with no more than the thousand dollars a month that Robbie sent her . Beauty and her fast , free-spending friends  --  Sophie , Baroness de la Tourette , and Margy , Lady Eversham-Watson , rich Americans married to titles , and both of them old ladies now . Decked out in their fashionable finery , and with a world war hanging over their heads , they had been a swarm of gaily colored butterflies in a garden that was about to be struck by a lightning bolt . Most of the boys Lanny had played with here , slightly older than himself , had died in Flanders . The sons they had left behind had died in the recent war ; but the breed went on  --  generation after generation born , raised , educated at great expense and trouble , only to he slaughtered on some foreign field . To the pair of English parents at The Reaches it did not seem rational , and the American pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the midst of the hottest of political campaigns . Their unwritten constitution required a general election every five years at the maximum , and this time the war had forced a breach of the rule . Now that the land was safe , they did not wait until the Japs had given up . The Conservatives thought they would stand a better chance before the glamour of victory had faded from Winston Churchill 's brow ; Labour thought that he was a grand old than for warmaking but they did n't want any of his peacemaking . They were " going to the country , " as they phrase it , and the polling was to be in late July . Following Lanny 's suggestion , Rick had invited the Labour party leaders to consider Alfv , already well known to them . It was obvious enough that campaigning would be hard on a man who could not walk or stand without a steel brace on one leg ; service in Parliament wouldn'tp284be any picnic either . Alfy had got a leave and come home , and his personality had charmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his legs were long and sound , and he had drawn in the Labour program with his mother 's milk . He was only twenty-eight , and the movement kept talking about " new blood . " He knew how to talk to servicemen , and to the young women who had toiled in the munitions plants to keep the war going . At the end of World War I they had been promised homes fit for heroes to live in , and they had assuredly not got them . This time they meant for things to be different . So this twice-wounded Royal Air Force hero had been put up as the candidate and now was in the midst of a whirlwind , speaking at several meetings every night and at noon-hour meetings in factories . His mother and father came to the more important meetings and spoke for him . Nina went to gatherings of the women and explained to them what it would mean to have a government of their own kind of people , familiar with their needs . The Labour party was campaigning on a carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do during five years of office : the nationalization of basic industries , coal , transport , communications , steel , and so on . The campaign was one of education , to show the people what such a program would do for them and what a difference it would make in their lives . Security from the cradle to the grave was the slogan . In the midst of these excitements the family had n't much time to give to problems of the future ; but Rick said that he had canvassed the situation thoroughly and was ready to go in for the five-year deal if Lanny still wanted him . What attracted him , he said , was Lanny 's assurance that , whatever the program decided upon , it would be some sort of job that he could do in part at home . At the age of forty-six , he was beginning to be troubled by his game leg , and he had been attracted by Lanny 's picture of Roosevelt lying in bed without his braces and with a stack of documents beside him . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would get a lot more out of his mind . Lanny said , " Come and do it . " They took a morning off to thrash out their problems , Their first job would be in New York , where they would rent an apartment , if one could be found , and set to work to get the best advice front persons who knew the movement for peace and social justice . When they had chosen their course , they would pick out some small townp285not too far away and there would establish a small office and two homes . Rick said , " I understand there 's a terrible housing shortage and you ca n't rent anything . " Lanny answered , " You ca n't rent but you can buy , and we 'll have to pay the price . I 'll find you a bungalowtypehouse so that you wo n't have stairs to climb , and it wo n't be far from the office . " They assented to the ex-P.A. ' s proposal that he was to stay in the background . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his own record was dubious ; he was supposed to have been a pro-Nazi and he did n't want to bother with public explanations . Laurel would use her pen name ; she would be Miss Mary Morrow and would be the one who was supposed to have the money ; a woman 's money was like her age , she did n't have to talk about it unless she pleased . When the publicity started there would be a lot of it , and Laurel would stand it as best she could . There would be a mysterious gentleman in the background , carefully keeping out of the way of reporters . A lady had a right to end war in the world if she could , and she also had a right to have a gentleman friend . Far away to the west , across the American continent , there had been an assemblage of major importance to anybody interested in the keeping of the peace . Delegates had come to San Francisco from most of the governments of the earth , to form a new version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it , but he had given it a name , the United Nations Organization . Having completed its work and adopted a charter , it dropped the last word , but for some reason the British preferred to retain it and kept writing and talking about UNO . Lanny had n't been able to get adequate accounts at Bienvenu , but now in the British newspapers and magazines he studied the details . There had been a long-drawn-out struggle over the proposed charter . The Soviet representatives had been leery of any proposal which would give power to the small nations ; their position was that Russia , America , and Britain had won the war and would have to keep the peace . How farcical to pretend that Honduras , for example , should have a say about it ! The strategy of this was clear enough ; Russia had swallowed all the small nations about her and did n't want them to have any say about anything . The other small nations were capitalist small nations and looked for financial favors to the capitalist big nations ; obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this argument the discerning reader could see the pattern of all the disputesof future years ; these four trained Socialists did not fail in discernment . The dispute had grown so warm and the blockade so serious that President Truman had sent the ailing Harry Hopkins flying to Moscow to talk to Stalin about voting procedure and other questions that had arisen between the two countries . That poor man was the only one who could do this job , because he had been present at the previous conferences , and knew what had been in Roosevelt 's mind , and what had been in Stalin 's mind as far as Stalin was willing to reveal it to Americans . So in the end a compromise had been worked out . The Soviet Union got three votes , and it was agreed that the Soviet Union , Britain , and the United States should each have the right to veto any action of the Security Council that involved their affairs . The Soviet Union reluctantly agreed to permit the General Assembly to discuss whatever problems were brought before it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . Such was the new instrument to preserve world peace  --  like a horse with hobbles on , and no way to get them off . It took no powers of divination to say that UN , or UNO , would not travel very far on the road to Utopia . The four peace conspirators agreed that they would have to study that charter , and probably spend more than five years pointing out to the world what was wrong with it . Rick said , " It all depends on the thirteen men of the Politburo . If they are willing to take what they 've got and settle down and develop it with loans from America , then we 're all right until the next slump comes . On the other hand , if they insist upon taking the rest of Central Europe and making a try for Western Europe , then all the charters in the world wo n't bind them , and it wo n't matter how Honduras votes . " " Funny thing , " added Lanny . " In the early twenties Stalin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trotsky who was for world revolution . Now that Trotsky is dead , it will be odd to see Stalin adopting the program of his hated rival . " Rick said , " Do n't let Sister Bess hear you say that ! " Lanny and Laurel were flown by the familiar Iceland route and set down gently on the tip of Long Island . Robbie had a car waiting , and they went by ferry to the Connecticut shore . There was that large Budd family , scattered over a township , each subgroup with its ownp287comfortable home and its own sense of importance . They ranged in age from ninety-seven to two-and-a-half ; Baby Lanny was the latest addition , the new generation being not so prolific as the old had been in its time . The old grumbled about this , and the young smiled . Nearly three months had passed since mother and father had seen their little one ; he could run faster and more safely , and he knew many new words . He had been kept reminded of his parents , and was ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Far-off lands and wars did n't mean much to him , but a rabbit was alive , and would eat lettuce leaves , and wrinkle his nose , and learn to follow you about . Life is a source of wonder , to a child as well as to a philosopher . A part of it is rhythm ; and when Lanny sat at the piano and played little tunes with strong accent his son behaved just as Baby Marcel had done , and Frances in her time , and Marceline in hers . Frances would take Baby Lanny 's two hands and teach him the same dance steps that Lanny had taught her ; so it is that the torch of culture is passed down the corridor of time . Frances was fifteen , a very lovely age , where the brook and river meet , womanhood and childhood fleet . She too had a world of her own and delighted in telling about it : the school she had attended , the friends she had made , the boat they sailed on the river . Her crushes had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cheeks took on color when she was teased about them . That was according to nature 's scheme and was understood by parents . It was early July , and she was going with her cousins to a mountain camp , and later her mother and stepfather had promised to come and take her back to England . She had been so happy in both countries that it was hard to choose ; she thought she would like to divide her time between them . One half of the war was over , the worst half , as people believed ; but nearly everybody , high or low , had some relative in the Far East . Everybody read the papers and listened to the radio , trying to guess how long the Japs would hold out and would the Russians come in . Lanny was n't free to tell what he knew about the matter . He said , " It will be bad if they do n't , " and his skeptical father answered , " It will also be bad if they do . " Robbie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House . New Man and True Man , you could make puns about him , but they were n't funny to the president of Budd-Erling ; he said it was like turning a high-powered automobileover to a child . Robbie wanted the war to be won , but you could n't expect him to be too eager about it , considering what the end was going to mean to his business.  | Esther of course wanted to hear about her niece , Peggy Remsen , and what she was doing . The returning couple made it sound quite fascinating , but really it was hard work , and messy , like cleaning up after a fire or an earthquake . However , Peggy was enjoying it and was meeting very nice young fellows , of the sort that her aunt would approve . Barely four years ago Esther had been thinking of her stepsonas a possible nephew-in-law , and maybe Peggy had had thoughts along the same line , but that was all over now . There was Baby Lanny , and Esther hoped they would let him stay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big cities on many grounds , hygienic , moral , esthetic , political . It saddened her to see her own little river port growingat so insane a rate , and the money her husband was making out of it weighed little in her balance . The couple drove to New York , in the car which Robbie always loaned them , and with gasoline coupons of which he had a plentiful supply . They opened up their apartment , and Laurel went to see her editors and find out what else they wanted her to write . Lanny took off his uniform , not wishing to advertise his past . He wanted to report to some of his clients about conditions in Europe , and what he had found there , and the prices . Zoltan was at the seashore , but came to town to meet his colleague ; the Hungarian-born art expert had wanted to join the Monuments , but they would n't take him because he was too old . He was familiar with all the places Lanny had visited and with the art works he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its tragedies . Also Lanny had to visit his father 's lawyers and find out about the money he was going to get . All the legal formalities had been complied with , and one of the great Wall Street banks had an order to turn over to him the securities specified in Emily Chattersworth 's will . Lanny identified himself and arranged to leave them where they were and let them accumulate interest and dividends according to their nature . The Sept Chenes property in Cannes was in charge of caretakers , and he would wait for conditions to improve before putting it on the market . Major Jim Stotzlmann came to town . He had been out in San Francisco attending the birth pangs of the United Nations . It was his practice to be in all places where important things were happening ; he could alwayspull some wires and have some brass hat or bureaucrat or newspaperpublisher send him , and he would write accounts of the eventp289which showed that he knew everybody connected with it and enjoyed the confidence of the most exalted . That made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Budd apartment , and they sat and swapped gossip until the small hours of the morning . Life was so exciting that it always seemed a shame to go to sleep ; you raided the icebox and ate a snack and then went on talking , and just as you were thinking about leaving you flushed some new and delightful item of gossip . It was the first time Jim and Lanny had met since Roosevelt 's death , and they mourned together . Naturally Lanny wanted to know all about the New Man , the Tru-man , and naturally Jim possessed the information . Harry was a kind and decent sort but tragically unequipped to run the affairs of the world . When word of the death had come he had been like a man caught under an avalanche ; he had exclaimed to one of his friends , " Look what 's fallen on me ! " He wanted to follow in F. D. R. 's footsteps , but the steps were too far apart for him . Of necessity he wanted people he knew to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of friends who did n't know any more about world affairs than he did ; they were a pretty crude sort , according to the scion of the Stotzlmanns . The new President had been a captain of artillery , so he had a great respect for the high brass ; he seemed also to trust the Wall Street fellows . F. D. R. had been able to manage them , but now they were managing Truman , and the prospects for the New Deal looked dark indeed . " What are you going to do now ? " inquired Jim , and Lanny said he was going back to buying old masters ; he would n't mention Emily 's money to one of the town 's most celebrated gossips . Lanny said that he had lost his status , and when the other offered to introduce him to Trumanhe declined politely ; he would n't promise to serve any man until he knew what sort of service the man would ask . If things in Washingtonwere going to be as bad as Jim feared , Lanny would stay away . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man they had ever known , the greatest President the country had ever had  --  so they agreed . Lanny recited the verses which Rick had written , and they sorrowed for the sheep wandering alone in the hills . Another mourner was Charles T. Alston , who also had lost his status by that apoplectic stroke in Georgia . The old gentleman had been in San Francisco , not as a leading adviser , but as a humble assistant to one of these ; his advice had been asked occasionally but rarely taken . Nowp290he was going back to his old occupation ; he had accepted a position in one of the smaller New England colleges , this time to teach , not geography , but industrial relations , in which he had become something of an expert . A summer session was just starting , and Lanny drove out and sat in on one of his old friend 's lectures , then spent the night in his home . Alston was a widower and lived with a widowed sister . He was well content to have a rest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living a college campus was an Elysian field and a lecture room a sanctuary . But he was dreadfully unhappy about the world . He judged that the charter adopted at San Francisco was wholly inadequate , and in some ways worse than a disagreement , because it lulled the world with a false sense of security . There was looming a conflict between the capitalistand the Communist worlds , and the UN would be powerless to prevent it . What was the sense of a police force if any would-be lawbreakerhad the right to veto what the police proposed to do ? And where was the leadership that was going to work out a compromise among greedy and self-willed great powers ? Inevitably this led to the new President  --  all roads led to him , for he controlled the greatest single lump of power in the world . Alston said , " The man 's an enigma to me . He says he believes in the principles of the New Deal and means to carry them out , but apparently he has no use for any of our crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we find ourselves shunted aside ; when we ask politely if our resignationswould be welcomed we are answered coldly . I think perhaps the Governor spoiled us ; he let us have our own way too much , and we set too high a value upon our attainments . Anyhow , we see our duties being turned over to men who do n't understand the New Deal and would hate it if they did . " Again Lanny recited the poem " The Shepherd Is Dead , " and this time it brought tears to the eyes of a man whose hair had turned white in the service of Franklin Roosevelt . Alston had given sixteen years to helpingthe " Governor " plan his programs and carry them out . He said now , " We have to keep our faith in democracy and believe that the people will raise up a new leader . " This pair had lost their influence over affairs , but they had not lost their interest . They were like parents who have seen their children go out into the world ; the parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their fears follow the children in whatever they do . Both Lannyp291and Alston worried about what was left of the war . Would the Japaneseyield to the air attack , or would their home islands have to be invaded ? And if the Russians got into China would they ever get out ? Alston had thought it a great mistake to invite Stalin to declare war upon Japan ; he felt certain that when the Emperor gave up , the troops in China and on the conquered islands would follow his lead . Alston was troubled by the idea that the revolutionary fervor of the Soviets was evolving into plain Russian patriotism of the old imperial type . The ex-P.A. told of the discoveries he had made in Germany , and said that he felt frustrated because he could no longer take them to the man at the top . " I 'm back in my old days , " he said . " I take them to my English friend , and he puts them into the Socialist press . Apart from that , I 'm out of everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lanny , " he remarked suddenly , " I consider that you have earned a reward . " " I 'm not worried about that , " was the reply . " I can always earn what I need , and I do n't care anything for publicity . " " That is n't what I mean . There is a story about to break , the biggest in the world , and you have the right to be in on it . " There was a special look of seriousness in the ex-geographer 's eves , and Lanny read it . " You mean  --  ? " he said , and stopped as if he could n't quite bring himself to say the words . " Yes , I mean ! " replied the other , smiling . " You ought to be there and see it , and when the news comes out your wife will have a story like nothing else ever . " " Where should I go ? " " To a place called Los Alamos , in New Mexico . " " Would they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix it so that they will . You should go quickly because the event may happen any day . They do n't give me anything but a wink , but that 's enough . " " I 'll start tomorrow , " Lanny said . A wink was enough for him too . " I suggest that you make sure by calling on Einstein . Ask him to give you a note . He 's the king of the whole shebang . " " The word being a pun ? " inquired Lanny , and they both grinned . Alston took one of his visiting cards and wrote on the back of it : " Dear Oppy : Trust Lanny Budd as you would trust me . He was Roosevelt'sconfidential agent for eight years . Let him tell you his story , and you will understand why I have sent him . C.T.A. " He handed the card to Lanny and asked , " Does the name J. Robert Oppenheimer mean anything to you ? "  | " I do n't think I have heard it . " " He is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project . He headed the group that took Einstein 's formula and turned it into physical reality . At the beginning F. D. R. called me in to help in the picking and choosing . Oppy won my confidence , and I hope I won his . You will find out for me . " " You mean a young physicist has been running that enormous project ? " " Not in the business sense . That was General Groves . You have been talking about him for a year or more ; but you do n't know Greek . The Greek word for grove is Alsos . " So then Lanny saw . All he said was , " Oh ! " " General Groves is an Army officer and an executive ; he runs the business . But he is not a physicist , and has to do what the physicists tell him . They tried the experiments and laid down the processes , the engineersworked out the techniques , and G.G. , as they call him , let the contracts , paid the money , and protected the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion dollars ' worth of labor and materials been risked on the basis of formulas worked out in a few mathematical brains . There had been laboratory experiments , but there was n't a bit of assurance that things that happened on an infinitesimal scale in the lab could be made to happen on a colossal scale in hundred-million-dollar factories . " " People call F. D. R. a gambler , " remarked Lanny . " If the gamble succeedsthey will call it genius . " Lanny went back to his apartment and told his wife , " I have a chance to get in on the biggest thing going . Unfortunately it 's top secret ; but some day soon it 'll be a story I can tell you and you can write it . Want to go along ? " " Where to ? " " A place in New Mexico that I never heard of before . " " When do we start ? " " Early tomorrow morning . I have to get a trailer from Robbie . You can spend the time at his New Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky , and maybe make a story about them . " " Righto , " said Laurel , who had recently visited Rick 's home on the Thames . The ex-P.A. went to the phone . Robbie was purchasing new aluminum trailers every week , for he was still hiring new people and had to havep293a place to put them . Lanny said , " Laurel and I want a trailer , to start tomorrow for New Mexico . I ca n't explain . " " No harm in my guessing ? " " Not a bit , but do n't do it out loud . Laurel will stop at Budd "  --  the name of the plant where Robbie was trying out his jet engines . " How early do you want it ? " " As early as you can get it here . Laurel does n't like to ride in city traffic with a trailer attached , so suppose you have your man meet us in front of the post office in Newark at nine tomorrow morning . " " He 'll be there , unless the traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey , not New York , " said Lanny . His father chuckled . " I have heard of it . " They left their apartment at eight . At that hour the traffic was mostly into the city , so they had their half of the tube and the Skyway pretty much to themselves . They got to Newark ahead of time . Robbie 's man had had the same idea and was waiting for them . They drove south on Highway i until they found a place where there was plenty of room on the side , and there the expert unhitched the trailer and attached it to Lanny 's car , which had been prepared with a " ball " when they had taken this same trip the previous year . Lanny handed the man a ten-dollar bill and all was well . They turned off the highway and took the road to Princeton , and in that lovely old college town Lanny found a shady spot for car and trailer , so that Laurel could read comfortably . Then he walked to the imitation Gothic building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Advanced Study has nothing to do with Princeton University ; it is a separate affair , supplied with an endowment of five milliondollars by two Jewish department-store owners . Here great thinkers in all branches of learning use their minds , free from other duties and cares . From here Albert Einstein , refugee from the Nazi lunatics , had written to President Roosevelt , calling his attention to the fact that recentdiscoveries in physical science had created the possibility of atomic fission on a significant scale . A curious sort of revenge which the whirligigof time had brought : it was upon Einstein 's formula governing the relationship between matter and energy that all these discoveries were based ; and it was this formula which Lenard and the other Nazi lunaticshad been banning by force from Germany . Four years ago Lanny had come here to be briefed by one of the Professor 's assistants , preparatory to his going into Naziland in an effort to find out what progress they were making in atomic fission . The elderly cherub , as Lanny thought of him , had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being among the kindest of men . They had played Mozart 's sonatas for violin and piano , and Lanny had come back long afterward and been surprised to discover that this man who was trying to evolve a theory that would include the whole physical universehad room in his mind to remember which sonatas they had played . A sweet and gentle person as well as a great one , and these qualities are not always found together . He received his visitor in an oak-paneled room containing a large center table , used no doubt for seminars . He was cordial , and deeply interested to hear what Lanny had seen of physical science in Germany . Having been director of the Physics Department at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin , and having attended congresses of physicists for thirty years or more , he knew all the men whom Lanny had helped to run down and question  --  Hahn and Weizsacker , Bothe , Heisenberg , Plotzen , Salzmann . He listened with glee to the story of how Lanny had captured old Phillip Lenard and then been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A special and peculiar sort of vengeance over an ideological enemy , a sort which even the kindest-hearted scientist might enjoy . After listening , he said , " Why do n't you stay , Mr. Budd , and we will play some music . " Lanny explained , " I ca n't stay . My wife is sitting outside in the car . " " But why did n't you bring her in ? " " What I want to speak to you about , Professor , is not for wives . " Lanny showed him the card which Alston had written and said , " He thought that 1 had done so much for the project that I was entitled to see what is expected to happen in New Mexico . He suggested that I should stop by , on the chance that you too might be willing to give me a note . " " Indeed yes , Mr. Budd . Certainly you have earned that right . " He took a sheet of paper and wrote : " Lanny Budd is my close friend and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always signed himself , and Lanny thought , A. Einstein and A. Lincoln . The great man waved aside the ex-P.A. ' s thanks . His face was deeply lined and his soft brown eyes were sad as he said , " I gave my sanction to this Manhattan District project , as they call it , because I felt it was my duty . Now that the war is so near to being won I find myself half wishing that the effort may not succeed . "  |p295Said  Lanny , " Our military people estimate that it may cost us a million casualties to take the Japanese home islands . " " So I am told ; and this project might be the means of saving them . But it is a moral question which I shall never be able to resolve to my satisfaction  --  whether we scientists have the right to permit our knowledgeto be used for destruction on such a frightful scale . " The two travelers returned to Highway i and drove on to North Philadelphia , skirting the great city and heading westward on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trailer trip it had been winter and they had got as far south as they could ; now it was summer and they stayed north . The shiny new trailer followed obedientlybehind , and they drove through lovely farming country lush with ripening crops . Past the Gettysburg battlefield , where guides waited to show them the monuments , but they did not stop . Then the steel and coal country  --  Allegheny County , the heart of America 's industrial power ; it was ugly and depressing , but you could n't afford to look down upon it in wartime . Rather you must marvel and rejoice , while your car and trailer ran for miles past one single plant that turned out steel for guns and tanks . The travelers crossed the Alleghenies by a broad pass , and then it was the level farmlands of Ohio , and now and then a great city throbbing with industry . They stopped for dinner and drove on until late , then found a trailer camp and had a sound sleep in their little one-room home . It was furnished completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at such short notice . Perhaps he had them all fixed up in advance , so that mechanics and lady riveters would n't have to go shopping when they might put in the time on a fighter plane . Through Indiana and Southern Illinois and then across the Mississippi by a long bridge . They were in Missouri , from which President Truman and his cronies had come . When you said " I 'm from Missouri , " it meant that you were of a skeptical disposition and wanted to be shown . All the world was waiting for Harry to show them , and ardent New Dealerslike the son of Budd-Erling were cherishing no great expectations . He turned on the radio in the car and listened to news of the latest bombing raids over Japan , comforting himself with the thought that at least an artilleryman-haberdasher could n't lose the war . There was a hot spell , and perspiration gathered on their foreheads ;  |p296then  came a thunderstorm , and it was pleasanter . They bought food in a grocery and did not stop for meals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Laurel might guess but did n't ask . She dozed while he drove , and then it was turn about . Presently they were in Kansas , a wide state , with seemingly endless fields of wheat and corn . Trending southward , they came into the Panhandle , and then to a corner of Texas . The roads ran straight most of the time , and the men also ran straight , they would tell you . Lanny had seen them all over Europe , proud of themselves and certain that Texas was winning the war , with just a little help from Oklahoma and Kansas . In West Texas the hills begin , and presently there are mountains , alwaysbare and rocky , so different from the forest-clad ranges of the East . Nothing useful grew here , except in irrigated valleys . It was hot in the month of July  --  Mark Twain had joked about hell and Texas . They stopped in a town and bought a dishpan and a chunk of ice to go in it , and set that on the seat between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thermometer would have made them feel hotter , so they did not buy one . Then it was New Mexico , and the mountains were gray , brown , red , black ; sometimes green , but it was n't verdure , and sometimes white , but it was n't snow . The highway wound here and there , finding its way up through passes and down again . The breeze of the car 's motion dried you out but did n't cool you ; if you put your hand on one of the rocks by the roadside you would take it away in a hurry . The ice melted fast , and they drank large draughts of the cold water . So to the new-paved road that led off to the wartown of Budd . Lanny had phoned , and they were expecting him ; he and Laurel had been there before . They drove to what is called a mesa , a plateau , and what they saw astonished them ; only a year and a half had passed , and what had magically become a town appeared now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as La Guardia , and along one side a mile or more of one-story office buildings and hangars and sheds , and back of them block after block of dwellings , all in the Spanish style of this region , of adobe brick or tile . The government had built all this and the government owned it ; they would offer to sell it to Robbie for ten per cent of its cost , but what would Robbie or anybody else do with it when the war was over ? Especially with the UN proposing to prevent any more business opportunitiesof the sort !  |p297Everybody  was working here like all-possessed , knowing that the Germanshad been ahead . New types of planes were being assembled , the component parts coming in caravans of trucks . New types of engineswere installed in them , and then they were wheeled or towed out to the field . " Jet buggies " they were called , and weirdly accoutered pilots would be fitted into them  --  the jokers said they had to be fitted in sections on account of the small space in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred miles an hour now ; they flew five or six miles high , and the plexiglass covers the pilots fastened over themselves had to withstand heavy outward pressures . When everything was ready there would come a roar and a flash of white flame . Stand a good way off and always at the side ; if you stood in the rear you would l ) e burned completely black . The little plane would leap and go roaring down the runway , and then shoot into the air and become a streak in the sky . Faster and faster ! There was a saying : " If you can see them , they 're obsolete . " LANNY saw his wife comfortably settled in an air-conditioned guest house , and then he set out by himself . He drove faster now because there was nobody but himself to watch the speedometer . The school site called Los Alamos lies about forty miles northwest of Santa Fe , and when he got into that neighborhood he looked for road signs , and there were n't any . He stopped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to Los Alamos ? " The answer surprised him . " You do n't get there , buddy ; there 's no such place . " For a moment he thought the man was joking and answered in kind , " There must be some mistake on my map then . " " Listen , brother , " said the man . " The Army says there ai n't , and what the Army says goes around here . " " Oh , I see , " replied the traveler . " It happens that I have important business at Los Alamos . "  | " If you think you have business , buddy , just go ahead and try . If you find it , you 'll be the first one . " Lanny , a mere civilian now , said no more but drove on . There was no law against scouting round in this mountain and desert land , so he drove and kept looking . There were road signs directing him to Santa Fe , and others to the little town of Espanola , so from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he was . He came to the deep White Rock Canyon of the Rio Grande . Behind it were tall mountains , and a road went winding up to what might be a plateau . At the entrance were heavy gates and a guardhouse , but no sign of any sort . There stood a sentry with a tommy gun , and Lanny could guess what that meant . He stopped his car . " Soldier , I 'm looking for Los Alamos . " The answer was , " Have you a pass ? " When Lanny said , " I have credentials , " the answer to that was , " There 's no such place . " The man was polite , but there was a weary tone to his voice , as if he had said the same thing a hundred times before and might have to say it another hundred . " Very sorry , but you know what orders are . There 's no such place as Los Alamos . You have to write to Box 1663 , Santa Fe . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a shelf road winding up a cliff , and there was a surprising lot of traffic . The cliff was of volcanic material , porous and easy to dig into , and the Indians had known it for centuries . There were whole colonies of cliff dwellings , and anyone might collect arrowheads and bits of pottery by the bushel . So to Santa Fe , the capital city of the state , built in Spanish adobe style ; it was a favorite haunt of artists and tourists  --  but seldom in the month of July . Lanny got a room in an air-conditioned hotel and on its stationerywrote a note to Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer : " I have come here with cards of introduction from Charles T. Alston and Albert Einstein . I do not want to entrust these to the chances of the mail , but hope that you will give me a chance to present them to you in person . The cards read as follows "  --  and Lanny quoted the messages , adding , " I have just returned from Europe where I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which you are especially interested . I have credentials from the OSS . " He signed himself " Respectfully , Lanning Prescott Budd , " addressed the letter to Box 1663 , and took it to the post office . Then he came back and had a bath and a shave and a meal . He did n't know how long it would take the letter to reach its destination , but he guessed that mail would be carried frequently to the top-secret place , possibly by air . But Oppy might not be there , and his secretary might not have authority to deal with a stranger . In the lobby of the hotel thep299stranger bought newspapers and magazines and then stretched himself on the bed for a comfortable wait . It was midevening before the call came . A voice , high-pitched and young-sounding , inquired , " Is this Mr. Budd ? This is Dr. Fairchild . Could you arrange to come to the confidential place in the morning ? " Lanny said , " I was there this afternoon , but they would n't let me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Office Number Three , in Santa Fe , and identify yourself , they will give you a permit . When you get here you will be brought to me . " Lanny had a well-earned sleep , and in the morning the hotel porter told him where to go ; everybody knew that something important was going on at that address but had no idea what . At the office he was escorted into a cubicle , where he presented his Connecticut driver 's license , his calling card , his two cards of introduction , and a bunch of letters which he happened to have with him . He had to fill out a questionnaire , giving his name , his age , his place of birth , the names of his parents , and a lot of other details . They took his fingerprints and then made out a pass which , they told him , would be valid only until six o'clock that day . Hard luck if his car broke down ! He retraced the hot , sandy drive on the cliffside road ; downhill most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with heavy traffic all the way . He came to the gate , and it was a different soldier . Others came and inspected the pass , the passee , and the car ; a minuteinspection  --  they lifted the seats , rummaged in the trunk , looked under the hood of the car ; Lanny wondered if they were going to open the cylinders . Nobody was going to carry any bombs or weapons , and perhaps not any opium or heroin or marijuana , into the world 's greatest nuclear research laboratory . They asked him to slide over in the seat and let a soldier drive . They went through the gate and climbed a winding road up to the top of the Pajarito Plateau , backed by the high green Jemez Mountains . The soldiersaid , " Sir , the regulations require that visitors shall look straight ahead . " Lanny promised to comply . They went through another pair of gates , and he could n't help seeing a high industrial fence topped with barbed wire on each side of the street . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the fence there were the stores and dwellings of a very ugly , higgledy-piggledy own . Lanny had never seen so many queer types of dwellings , andp300could guess that it had grown haphazardly and in a hurry . Later he was told that Oppy , who ran this place , had estimated that they would need accommodations for three hundred persons ; now , at its maximum , the town had twelve thousand . The place had been an expensive ranch school three years ago when the government had taken it over . There had been no time to level the ground ; the graveled roads went winding up and down and into canyons , and were lined on both sides with more queer kinds of emergency houses than Lanny had ever seen in one place : hutments , a dozen kinds of prefabricatedbuildings , two-story , four-apartment , board houses painted dark green , and more kinds and sizes and colors of trailers than anyone could imagine . Trucks whirling around corners kicked up dust . The visitor was taken into one of the dark green apartments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going . It was a study with a flattoppeddesk , comfortable chairs , reading lamps , and many books . Rising to greet him was an almost comically young and bouncing lad with curly golden hair , bright pink cheeks , and horn-rimmed spectacles . Lanny would have taken him for eighteen , and learned that he was twenty-three . " I am Dr. Fairchild , " he said , and Lanny would have liked to answer , " How well you are named ! " Instead he inquired with a grin , " Do I have to have shots ? " The other replied with a smile , " I am not that sort of doctor . I am one of those the soldiers here call long-hairs , ' meaning a physicist . " Seated , the youngster began ceremoniously , " Mr. Budd , I am one of Dr. Oppenheimer 's assistants . I told him over the phone about your letter , and he told me to see you . Unfortunately the regulations require that you be cleared by the Army Security Forces . Will you come with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitor , " By all means . I have been a secret agent for eight years and I know about security . " He noted that the GI who had driven him was staying right there by the door ; and when he went out with the young scientist the soldier followed a few steps behind . No doubt everything had been planned in advance . They walked several blocks through this strange town and came to a substantial building , which had been a part of the boys ' school . Ushered into an office , Lanny was introduced to a severe-faced gentleman who looked like a prize-fighter with his nose broken . The ex-P.A. turned over all his papers : the two cards and the OSS credentials , a driver'sp301license and such letters as he happened to have with him . The officer studied them and then said , " So far , so good . But you understand that such things can easily be forged ; also , I have to consider the possibility that the real Mr. Budd might have been slugged and buried somewhere out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , smiling . " What you want are psychological tests , which can not be forged . " " Would you mind telling me how you came to know Dr. Einstein ? " " It is all one story , and I had better begin at the beginning . My father is Robert Budd , president of Budd-Erling Aircraft . They have a new town called Budd in this state , and I have just come from there ; one of the things you can do is to telephone to the superintendent and get a physical description of me . I was born in Europe  --  " " In what country , sir ? " The stern officer was making notes . " Switzerland . I was raised in France and traveled all over Europe . After World War I my father brought me back to France , and on the steamer was Professor Alston , on his way to advise President Wilson at the Peace Conference . Alston had been in my father 's class at Yale , and he invited me to become his secretary because I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again until 1937 ; meantime he had become a member of Governor Roosevelt 's staff in Albany and had been taken to Washington with him . Alston sent me to Roosevelt , who invited me to become what is called " presidential agent . " I was Number 103 , but I doubt if he had that many . Have you heard of them ? " " They are not within the Army 's province , sir . Proceed . " " It happened that I had a boyhood friend in Germany who knew Hitler . I pretended to become a convert , and brought out information which F. D. R. said was of value . In the summer of 1941 I was trained to go into Germany to find out what they were doing about atomic fission , and that is how I came to know Einstein . I spent the summer in Princeton , and my instructor was Dr. Braunschweig . " Lanny turned to I ) r . Fairchild . " Do you know him ? " " I am sorry , Mr. Budd . I 'm a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tech . I have never been East . " " I have never been to Cal Tech , but I visited the Huntington Library . I am by profession an art expert , and that was my camouflage in Germany . I never finished my mission because my plane was wrecked on i he way to Iceland and I had both legs broken . You know how it is , Dr. Fairchild , when you bone up for an exam you forget a lot of it quickly ; but some of it is still in my mind . It began , I remember , with equals me squared , and you write the E with a capital , and the m and c in small letters , otherwise they mean other things than mass and the speed of light . The E is energy expressed in ergs , the mass is in grams , and the speed of light in centimeters per second . I could recite a numberof formulas , 1 believe . I have things like this floating through my mind : The separation factor , sometimes known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ratio of the relative concentrationof the desired isotope after processing to its relative concentration before processing . ' Does that mean anything to you , Dr. Fairchild ? " " Of course , Mr. Budd . " " Still more important is the fact that I played some of Mozart 's sonatas with Einstein . If you are musical  --  " " Unfortunately I am not . " " I called on Einstein only five days ago , to get that card . I told him what I had been doing in Germany in recent months , helping the Alsos Mission dig up atomic secrets . I worked with Professor Goudsmit and Colonel Pash , the military head of the mission . Pash and I drove up to a village called Urfeld , in the Bavarian Alps , to get hold of ' Werner Heisenberg . " " He was at Cal Tech , and I saw him . " " So then we have a point of contact ! Heisenberg is a medium-sized man , smooth shaven , pleasant mannered but oversure of his own importance . The principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for I had to hold him on my knees all the way on a drive out of the mountains , and his weight seemed to double . That is perhaps not very convincing  --  " " The way you tell it is , sir . " The young scientist was grinning . " The main point is what we found . The German efforts at atomic fission were judged amateurish . Their apparatus was good , but it was the wrong kind . They appeared to have the idea that a chain-reaction pile might be a bomb , and they were sure we could n't have anything better than they had , because they were Germans . However , we got some materials that were useful ; at a place called Hechingen , in the Swabian Alps , we got a ton and a half of uranium , a ton and a half of heavy water , and ten tons of carbon . I suppose all of it was shipped to this country . " " We did not see the Goudsmit reports , " said Fairchild . " I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed . " " Goudsmit was absolutely sure the Germans had nothing of importance . I captured Phillip Lenard for him , but he did n't think it was worth while even to talk to the old man . Perhaps you have seen pictures of him , so I will describe him  --  "  |p303The  Security officer had been listening , never taking his eyes off the visitor . Now he broke in , " I think I have heard enough to be sure of your identity , Mr. Budd . I should tell you that last night , when your letter came , I checked at once with Dr. Einstein and Mr. Alston by telephone , and also with OSS Washington , and they gave me various details by which I might identify you . This morning I phoned General Groves , and he authorized me to clear you provided that I was satisfied you were the right person . Nobody ever gets in here without the General 's OK . " " I am very obliged to you both , " said the visitor politely . " I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present at the Base Camp who is not actually working on the project . It will be better if you do n't say what you are there for or how you got in ; that will avoid hurt feelings . There are a number who would have liked to be present but have been sent to a place twenty-seven miles away . " " Thank you again , Captain . I 'm used to keeping my own counsel . " The captain made out the pass and handed it over . They shook hands , and Lanny went out with Fairchild . The latter remarked , " We are at the very top of our crisis , the thing we have been hoping and praying for and at the same time dreading . I am so nervous myself I can hardly sleep or eat . You are to drive to a place called Alamagordo , in the southernpart of the state . I am expecting to go there myself . I have to make certain records . " " Why do n't you ride with me ? " suggested the ex-P.A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me in . " " You are very kind , sir . I 'll phone Oppy and tell him we are coming . " The road followed the valley of the Rio Grande , which in its early stages flows south . For the most part it flows through canyons , and the road runs along the edge . Presently it was Highway 85 , and then they made better time . A wild and lonely country ; Fairchild said that the United States was fortunate in having great spaces in which dangerous modern experiments could be carried out . At Alamagordo there was an air-bombing range , with thirty or forty miles of unbroken desolate country . It was in the remote northern part of this that the all-important test was to be made . The barriers were down now , and the eager young scientist talked freely . He told about himself ; he still considered himself a student , but now he was learning by doing . The need for persons who understood modern physics was so extreme that you could have a job the moment you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fast as you could equip yourself for new duties . Fairchild had been a pupil of Oppy at the California Institute of Technology , and he adored his teacher , callinghim the greatest man in the world  --  then correcting it to say perhaps the second greatest , Lanny 's friend Einstein being number one . Time would decide between them , for the elder sage was nearing seventy , while the younger was only forty-one . The pupil described Los Alamos , an extraordinary shrine of science , the most secret place in the world , the place where the most deadly force in the world was being created and controlled . It was the force that made the heat and light which the sun had been scattering for millions of years and would continue to scatter for millions more ; the force that created all the uncountable suns in uncountable nebulae through a billionlight years of space . For the first time on this earth this force had been harnessed and would be put to use  --  and all in a space of five or six years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed between the discovery of fire and the building of a great steam locomotive . The " stuff " came from two enormous plants , a different kind from each . The Clinton Engineer Works near Knoxville , Tennessee , covered nearly a hundred square miles and had more than four hundred and twenty-five industrial buildings , some of them more than two miles long . Mostly they were low , flat structures of brick or tile or corrugated asbestos , without windows . Near by was the city of Oak Ridge  --  code name " Dogpatch "  --  with about seventy-five thousand population , and both this and Clinton had been built in less than three years . The plant made a uranium isotope , U-235 , by a minute and delicate process known as " electromagnetic separation . " Electrically charged particles of uraniumwere fired through a powerful electromagnet in a curving course ; the lighter particles were bent more than the heavier and were caught separately . This had been done on a minute scale in laboratories , but never on a scale above milligrams until the Clinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for twenty miles along the Columbia River in the State of Washington . It was known as the Hanford Engineer Works , and covered more than six hundred square miles of gray sand and sagebrush . Scattered over it were long , windowless concrete structures , many of them in the form of rectangles the size of several city blocks . Near by was a new town for seventeen thousand workers . Here was located a huge " uranium pile , " in which atomic processes transformedpart of the uranium into the newly discovered element knownp305as plutonium , this too being fissionable . No one knew which would make the more powerful bomb , if any . It was to Los Alamos that all the stuff came , and they worked over the problem of how to control it , how to shape it into a bomb , how to keep the bomb from going off too soon , and how to make it go off when they so desired . They had determined that there was a critical size for a nuclear chain reaction ; too much of the stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stuff and it would n't go off at all . Ordinary methods of detonation had no relation to this nuclear material ; what you had to do was to release some neutrons into the stuff  --  these neutrons , having no electrical charge , would penetrate the uranium nuclei and knock out other neutrons which in turn would do the same . How fast the chain reaction would be , a minute fraction of a second , was something that had been determined by mathematical formulas only . They were dealing with the deadliest material known , and had to do their work behind thick lead shields , and handle the stuff with long tools specially contrived . Everybody wore electroscopes that would tell instantlyif they were getting too heavy a dose of radiation . Oppy was the boss of all this  --  Oppy , the man with the chain-reaction brain , the boy who had given his teachers the answers before they had had time to formulate their questions ! Oppy trusted his mathematics , those " beautiful , wonderful regularities " which had ravished his youthful mind . Calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could n't exactlybe said that he was performing the Almighty 's orders , but he certainly was riding in the whirlwind and directing the storm . From the beginning he had been given everything he asked for , and everything had top priority ; he had been free to take up the telephone and call for a cyclotron that cost a million dollars . He and his fellow scientists had caused the expenditure of two billions , upon the basis of their nebulous theories and hopes . Now , in this lonely and baking desert of Southern New Mexico , they were going to put it to the touch and win or lose it all . It was a long drive , more than three hundred miles altogether . Lanny related stories about the German scientists he had helped to intern and question ; Fairchild talked about life in this secret utopia in which he had spent the past year . It was a comfortable life , for the Army saw to everything , heat , light , water , even food and recreation . There were huge cafeterias where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dances , and any sort of concerts , shows , and games you chose to get up ; also there were hunting and fishing . But your mail was censored and your telephone conversations listened in on , and you were restricted to an area with Taos , Santa Fe , and Albuquerqueat the corners . If you went elsewhere it had to be on business for the project , and you could n't let anybody know you were in town , not even the members of your family . Your children could go to school inside the project , but if they went to boarding school outside they could n't come back . This was hard on families , and on friends who could n't know anything about your affairs but a post-office box . In Berkeley , where Oppy had taught , the report was that he had been arrestedas a German spy . The scientists were a secret society , a consecrated order , which includedno fewer than ten Nobel Prize winners . Among themselves they spoke a code , so that workingmen or others who overheard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on the spur of the moment , and it took alertness to follow a conversation . Special codes would be made up for trips and for communications by telegraph or phone . Men with famous names changed them ; Lawrence was Larson , Fermi was Farmer , Compton was Comas , the Danish Niels Bohr was Nicholas Baker , called " Nick " by everybody . General Groves had been " GG , " but that seemed too obvious ; a clerk had misread it as 99 , and now that was his name . All these men would be at the scene of the test , and Lanny made mental notes about them . He also listened attentively to statements about the nuclear processes , and his old knowledge began to come back . He was able to form some idea of the developments that had taken place in four years ; that much of the war had been a century of ordinary time . He could compare what he learned now with what he had heard from Salzmann and Plotzen , from Bothe and Hahn and Heisenberg and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ages so far as nuclear physics was concerned . All the rest of the world except Canada and Britain would stay there until America chose to lift the curtain . They came to the Alamagordo reservation , an area so big that the rocks and sand and cactus and sagebrush seemed to go on forever . As you approached the test site there were the same security proceedings to be gone through . Lanny 's pass was OK , but that did n't keep his carp307from being searched , including the engine , and he was fingerprinted again ; this test site was even more top secret than Los Alamos . They drove in for some miles , and there were a couple of small buildingsand many Army tents , having to do not with the air base but with the test ; it was known as the Base Camp . The physicists had come here , traveling separately , and if they had met one another on a train they had carefully refrained from giving any sign of recognition . A few of them were middle-aged , but most were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was possible to become world-famous in your twenties . The field was open , and all you had to do was to take one step farther into the dark chamber where nature 's mysteries had been mysteriouslyhidden . There were Army and Navy officers also , and specially chosen enlistedmen who did the hard work . The Army 's Security officer took the son of Budd-Erling aside , not to put him through another grilling , for they respected the clearance from Los Alamos , but to inform him as to the regulations and administer a solemn oath that he would speak no word about what he had seen here until the story was officially released ; then , if he wrote anything about it , he must submit a copy to the Army in advance . Lanny had made all sorts of promises and kept them , but this was the first time he had had to swear . Lanny 's host was Oppy , a very much preoccupied man . He said , " We are taking you in on Einstein 's say-so , Mr. Budd ; make yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wavy dark hair , which he seldom let grow long . He was about Lanny 's height but weighed only a hundred and fifteen pounds at the moment  --  no doubt he had forgotten many a meal . His shoulders were stooped and his manner intense and nervous , for he was approaching the crisis of all his labors . He had a chainlightningmind that could run all around other men 's ; he could evolve long equations and remember them forever , and all that had come easily . But for the past three or four years he had been doing a job far more difficult from his point of view , the managing of an enormous undertaking , and the guiding and reconciling of a great number of men , some of whom were prima donnas and all of whom had their own fountainheadsof ideas . Robert Oppenheimer was the son of German-Jewish parents who had come to New York and made a modest fortune . All his life he had had all the money he wanted , and what he had wanted was a marvelous education , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvard , Cambridge , and Gottingen . He was still a student , he liked to say , and was getting education from everybody who could teach him . He lec/tured at a breakneck pace , and there were only a few people in the world who could understand him ; his pupils tried , and at least they could imitate his peculiar mannerisms : wearing blue shirts , smoking cigarettes endlessly , running their fingers nervously through their hair while they talked . Oppy spoke with quick excited gestures , and when he could get to a blackboard he soon had it covered with a maze of mystical symbols . Just now he was like a man balanced on a tightrope over an abyss . A terrible moment : some miles out there in the desert was an old ranchhouse , where a crew of highly trained men were engaged in putting the parts of the bomb together . They were under the direction of a Cornell physics professor , Dr. Bacher , who was Goudsmit 's " first Ph.D . " These parts had been made in different places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parts been joined ; never before had there been an atomic bomb in this world . The parts had been machined to the ten-thousandth of an inch , and now the damn thing was stuck ; it would n't go together and it would n't come apart ; if it blew up , that would be the end of the Cornell professor and all his trained crew , and of all the labors and hopes of the ten Nobel Prize winners and their hundreds of assistants . Indeed , it would have been the end of the entire bomb project . Oppy would go to the phone every few minutes and call the ranchhousewhile the others held their breath . Then he would grunt and light another cigarette and start his stoop-shouldered pacing of the floor . That went on for a while , and then at the phone a smile broke over his face , and he said , " That 's fine ! " and reported to the company , " They 've got it . " So it was possible to breathe again . The most dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made , and the finale was set for three days later , before dawn . Ten or twelve miles out in the desert a steel tower had been erected , and Lanny drove Fairchild and a couple of other late arrivals out to see it . A drive over the desert road , and there was the tall tower on which the bomb was to be hung . The best  --  or should one say the worst ?  --  results were to be expected from an explosion in the air , and in military use the weapon was to be used with a special timing device so that it would explode in the air . Men were busily hanging instrumentson the tower , by which it was hoped to record the various effects of the explosion . The scientists disagreed widely as to the force the explosionwould develop ; they guessed all the way from two hundred andp309fifty tons to twenty thousand tons of TNT . On the latter basis , a hundred and twenty-five such bombs would have equaled the damage done by the two-and-a-half-million tons dropped by all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instruments on the tower would be destroyed , others were being placed at intervals on the floor of the desert . From the conversation Lanny could guess that there was a trigger device which shot one section of the U-235 in between two other sections , thus bringing the whole to a size beyond the critical . The explosionwould go off with the speed of light , and it was a question whether the whole amount of the stuff would react or whether it would be blown apart and scattered in fragments . Many uncertainties for these learned gentlemen . One and all , they felt that their reputations were at stake ; one and all , they were going to be shown to the world either as miracle men or as the world 's most costly bunglers . When they learned that the new arrival had been with Goudsmit , they stopped work for a few minutes to question him . Not one of them had been abroad during the war , and apparently none of them had seen the reports . They were surprised to know how completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large scale . The story of poor old Lenard was good for a round of chuckles . These men of the free world all shared a loathing of fantastic creatures such as Osenberg and Sievers whom the Nazis.had set up as directors of the great physical laboratories of the Fatherland . Oppy no longer had to pace the floor ; he joined these groups and revealed himself as a genial person . He seemed sure that the test was going to succeed ; but many of the others had grave doubts ; they were sure their formulas were right , but what the formulas indicated was too colossal , too awful , for the mind to face . They discussed the consequences of the release of atomic energy , the greatest step in the whole history of science . Many were troubled in conscience because the first use of this colossal power had to be for the destruction of life . All agreed that , properly used , it would make man the master of the physicalworld . Once this power was harnessed to industry , production would become for practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth . Lanny brought up the subject whenever he found a chance and collected the opinions of many of these wise gentlemen . He did n't say what use he expected to make of the ideas , but he got the men to talkingabout the subject of war and what steps mankind would have to take to end it . One and all , they said that this discovery , if it proved top310be real , would make war impossible ; an atomic war would end only with the destruction of civilization as we knew it . More than one man said , " I am hoping the thing may fail , and that an explosive chain reaction may be proved impossible . Mankind is not far enough advanced , politicallyor morally , to be entrusted with such a weapon . " What Oppy said was , " We shall have to educate the people . We scientistshave hidden ourselves in our laboratories and forgotten the restof the world . Now we have to come out and take part in politics , and t make both the politicians and the public realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used wisely , and in misery if it is used evilly . " On Saturday , the 14th of July , the bomb was raised to the top of the steel tower and hung there . That dangerous job was witnessed only by the men who performed it . The test was set for four o'clock on Mondaymorning , and on Sunday night few slept soundly . Lanny lay on his Army cot in a tent he shared with young Fairchild ; he was n't sure if his tentmate was asleep , so he lay still , his mind roaming over a score of different aspects of the world-shaking event he hoped to witness . Even if the bomb did not explode , even if a sudden and violent chain reaction proved impossible , still there could be no doubt that the world was on the threshold of a new age of power . First fire , then steam , then electricity , then the internal-combustion engine , and now the nuclear chain reaction . Only two and a half years had passed since Roosevelt had confided to his P.A. the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successfuloperation . Roosevelt had n't said where or how ; but here Lanny had heard the story of how Professor Compton of the University of Chicagohad set up a laboratory in the squash court , under the stands of the football stadium , and there had managed to solve this most difficult problem . It was undoubtedly the most deadly contraption ever born of the brain of man . Bars of uranium oxide and of pure uranium were placed with spaces between them , so that bars of graphite could be slid in . Six tons of specially purified graphite were provided ; and you did n't just poke those bars in by hand , you had hooks operated by machines , with the operators staying behind heavy lead shields . Rods of cadmium , a metal which strongly absorbs the neutrons , could be moved in and out of the pile to control the chain reaction . The design of the pile was computed from the results of **26;3880;TOOLONG , and no one knew how accurate these were . Therefore , blocks of cadmium were suspended from the ceiling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case the reaction threatened to get out of control . At this time they did not know enough to be sure that they would not blow up a few blocks of the city of Chicago . So said Fermi , the Italian who was here under the name of Farmer ; he was the man who had first proposed the chain-reaction idea , three years earlier , and had tried it out with a microscopic quantity of U-z35 . In those happy days it had been the custom of scientists to publish their discoveries at once , and Fermi had set the whole world of physics to speculating and experimenting with this force that was the parent of all the heat , light , and motion in the world . Lanny had his private thoughts for this crucial occasion . He could n't say to these scientists , " I have a million dollars with which to prevent an atomic war " ; but he could feel them out and judge which men would be most useful for his purposes ; he could make friends with them , so that later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , they would know who he was . Whether nuclear fission was to be used in war or only for the purposes of industry , these were the experts whose say-so the world would have to heed . He found them in a grave mood , ready to speak . On Sunday evening General Groves arrived ; a heavy-set West Pointer just turning fifty , with a small mustache and thick black hair beginning to show gray . His face wore a rather grim expression , and Lanny could guess that he did n't welcome meeting strangers at this busy moment . He brought with him President Conant of Harvard and Dr. Bush of the OSRD . Lanny talked with his well-informed young tent companion . What would happen if lightning struck that steel tower ? Fairchild could n't be sure , but he said it was just as well that nobody should be near . Rain , he was positive , would n't hurt it , for this was not the kind of fire that water would have any effect upon ; when a chain reaction got going , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atoms of hydrogen and oxygen . One of the uncomfortable ideas these long-hairs had discussed was that a large-scale chain reaction might not stop with the isotopes of uranium . Suppose it were to start off some other heavy metal , iron , for example , and there should be a vein of it under this desert floor ! Orp312suppose  --  just supposing !  --  that it should set off a chain reaction of the lighter elements ? In that case a medium-sized planet of the solar system would disappear in one bright flash  --  though not bright enough to be observed by inhabitants of other planetary systems , if such inhabitants might be in the vasty deeps . In that case Lanny would never get to carry out Emily Chattersworth 's mission ; in that case , where would Lanny be , and where would Emily be ? He tried his best to persuade himself that somewhere , or out of all wheres , might be still existing the millions of millions of souls that had lived upon the earth during its last million or so of years , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these through the lips of Laurel and of Madame Zvzynski . The best he could do was to say that he would believe it when he woke up in that new state of being . From the tent opening he saw the lean figure of Oppy and the burly figure of GG , alias 99 , wandering about in the diminishing rain . He knew they could n't sleep , and he could imagine their discussion . They wanted aerial observation , photographs , and instrument recordings of the great event ; but pilots could n't see anything in this weather . More important yet , if the explosion came off , and the enormous radioactive cloud were brought down to the earth by rain , what would be the effect upon towns and ranches and growing crops ? These were new questions , and new fears for the authors of unprecedented destruction . Oppy lighted more cigarettes , and wandered about , peering up at the clouds and looking in vain for a star . The test was postponed from four o'clock to five-thirty . Later than that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then two , and they were enough ; the storm was passing . Oppenheimer and Groves consulted their meteorologist and decided that five-thirty would be H-hour . The lieutenant of the MilitaryPolice Detachment guarding the tower reported by telephone that all was well . The control station from which the bomb was to be detonatedwas ten thousand yards , about six miles , from the tower , and here a shelter of heavy logs and earth had been built , with a sloping side toward the explosion . The place assigned to the observers was a slight rise of ground , seventeen thousand yards from the tower , and their orders were to lie flat on the ground , face downward , and heads away from the blast . All were provided with dark glasses , but did not trust to these ; they buried their eyes in the sleeves of their forearms crooked in front of them.  |p313A  tension such as Lanny had never seen before in any group of men . The control room and various observation points were all tied in by radio , and twenty minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling  --  minus twenty minutes , minus fifteen minutes , and so on until the last five minutes , which were called minute by minute from a loudspeaker . Not a sound from any of those prostrate forms ; some , no doubt , were praying , others shuddering , all finding them the longest minutes in their lives . At minus forty-five seconds an automatic mechanism took over , and from then on all the complicated procedure was out of the hands of human beings . There was a reserve switch with a soldier-scientist sitting before it ; he could have stopped everything if he had been told to  --  but he was n't . At the precise second there came a flash of light , the like of which had never been seen on this earth , many times the brightness of the sun at its brightest . A blind girl a hundred miles away perceived it somehow , and before the sound reached her she asked , " What was that ? " The scientists leaped to their feet and looked through their dark glasses at an enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky . They braced themselves for the blast , the mass of air pushed from the explosion , with the greatest force ever created by human beings . At ten miles distance it was not serious , but it knocked flat two men who had stood outside the control room . A few seconds more and there came the sound , a thunderous all-pervading roar like nothing anyone could imagine . A huge cloud of many bright colors had surged up into the sky . Explosions seemed to be going on inside it , and the shock waves and sounds continued . It billowed and boiled and became an immense mushroom , emitting light like the sun and growling and roaring like the monsters of primeval time . The watchers were stunned at first ; then exultation possessed them , and they shook one another 's hands , they hugged the nearest man , and cried out with wonder and delight . They had done it ! Their formulas were right ! A sight never to be forgotten by anyone who was there . The light turned the whole landscape to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if in a dawn of many suns . The light shifted and changed , from golden to red to blue to violet , then to gray ; nobody dared look at it without the dark glasses . The cloud continued to rise and boil until it became a tower some eight miles tall ; then slowly the light faded out of it , the grumbling ceased , and the wind began to shift it , fortunately away from the Base Camp and with no rain to bring it quickly to earth . The learned scientists stood chattering like a group of schoolchildren . Their satisfaction was beyond bounds . One and all , they had staked their time , their thought , their health , their reputations , upon this , the most costly of all scientific experiments . Up to the last second they had had no surety of success , and now , all of a sudden , they had it in overwhelming quantity and quality . Nobody could have asked more , nobody could have imagined more . There was a story about a pilot who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report by radio . When he saw the flash and felt the blast he shouted , " The damn long-hairs have let the thing get away from them ! " But it was n't so ; it was " Operation according to plan . " One of the scientists confided to Lanny the astounding fact that the bomb which had wrought this colossal effect was slightly larger than a baseball and weighed no more than twenty or thirty pounds . Specially equipped tanks , with thick lead covering , were wheeled to the scene in course of the day . One of them carried the quiet Professor Fermi ; he came back and reported that the steel tower , with all its instruments , had completely disappeared ; the steel had been vaporized and must have gone up in the cloud . At the base of the tower was an immense crater with sloping sides . The sand of the desert floor had been fused and was now a sheet of green glass , upon which nobody would dare to set foot for many a day , perhaps a year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war , " said 99 ; and Oppy added , " I hope it wo n't end civilization . "  |p317LANNY  drove back to the town of Budd and reported to his wife that he had seen something important which he was not permitted to disclose ; he thought it would n't be long before the story was released , and then she would have an eyewitness account to write up . In return , she told him that she had taken up the idea of writing a story about Robbie 's number-one test pilot , a daring fellow who flew everything that was made and was still alive in spite of having been doing it for twenty years . When he had flown a plane for an hour he knew more about it than its makers . His job was to get what he called " the numbers " : how fast the plane flew at level flight and how fast when rising ; how fast at sea level and at twenty thousand feet ; its engine temperatures , its gallons of fuel consumed per hour , and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army came and made the tests all over again before accepting the plane . No wonder Budd was a busy field ! It amused Lanny to hear his wife telling him things which he had been hearing from Robbie for a couple of decades . Did Lanny know what it meant for a plane to " snake " ? Yes , he had heard the expression . This pilot had a new model that snaked so that it almost yawed , and he had decided it was the fuel sloshing in the tank ; they were putting in baffles , which they hoped would stop the trouble . Laurel went on to describe the man 's pathetic little wife , who had never become reconciled to his dangerous job , not even at fifty dollars a day . Laurel said , " I wanted to tell her how sorry I was for her , but I thought I 'd better not . " Lanny answered with a smile , " Robbie would n't have liked it . " He teased her for inconsistency ; she , a hater of war , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Budd-Erling stockholder ; she was making blood money out of these engines of destruction . She had inherited the stock from her uncle , so , it was n't of her own choice ; and if she sold the stock , somebody else would get the profits , but it would n't stop the making of the engines . " Thou shalt not kill , " said the Commandment ; the Episcopalians had softened it to read " Thou shalt do no murder . " This illustrates the fact that moral problems are complicated , and not even God has been able to make them plain and simple . President Truman had gone to Germany , to sit down with Churchill and Stalin and try to solve those problems which had been troubling Franklin Roosevelt on the night before his death . Lanny had been free to tell his wife about this interview , and now , driving their little aluminumhouse back to New York , they listened to broadcasts speculating as to what might be going on at the Potsdam Conference . The fate of the world for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large quadrangular palace full of relics of Frederick the Great . Certainly it would have a great deal to do with what the Budd couple would be , thinking and doing in course of the next five years . The conference lasted two weeks and two days , and that gave the newspapers and radio commentators plenty of time to speculate , and gave the couple time to get their affairs in order . They took the trailer back to Newcastle , duly thanked its owner , and reported what they had seen at his town . They talked about the trip and about jets , but not a word about bombs . A dutiful son did feel free to say this much to his father , " Do n't quote me , but I think you can make your plans on the basis of the Japs giving up very soon . " The wise father looked at this man of mystery whom he knew so very well and saw a steady look in his eyes and a grave expression on his face . " You really mean that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't say more . " They found Frances in a state of excitement because her mother and stepfather were coming to pay a visit and take her on a trip across the continent . Ceddy had bought a big ranch in Western Canada  --  with Irma 's money , of course . It was raising wheat for England , a worthy purpose , and now harvest time was at hand , a great sight . They were going to make a grand tour , through the Canadian Rockies , and returningby way of California and Budd , in which Irma too was a stockholder . In the course of that trip the girl would make up her mind whether she preferred going back to England to school or staying in Newcastle . Lanny did n't want to influence her decision . He was aware that the elder Budds were extremely sensitive on the subject of divorces andp319would consider it a theme for gossip if Irma and Laurel were to be in the same town or if Lanny were to meet his former wife there ; he needed no hint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New York in the next day or two . He knew without being told that the arrival of a genuine English earl and countess would constitute a colossal social event , adding to the prestige of the Budd tribe . He looked with distaste upon such snobbery and had no desire for a close-up view of it . He took his eager young daughter for a sail on the river and listened to the outpouring of her small adventures and her hopes . He told her that she was to make up her own mind about her future . There was an agreement between her mother and himself that neither would ever do anything to influence her against the other , and this meant that Lanny could n't tell Frances his opinion about titles of nobility or about the false glories of inherited fortune . She would have to live in Irma 's world . She would see all the excitement over the almost-royal pilgrimage , be kowtowed to and admired and photographed , and must make what she could of it . He did feel free to tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could to end it . She , of course , could have no idea that hereditary privilege such as her own was among the causes of social and national strife . They left the baby in the care of Agnes , the skilled trained nurse who had been a second mother to him from his birth . It was summer , and cool breezes blew off the Sound ; also Laurel wanted to write an article about test pilots of jet planes  --  of which she disapproved . Lanny said she would have to leave her disapproval out of the story , for jet planes might have given the victory to Germany if Britain had n't been able to build them faster and better . Jet planes were now knocking the Japs out of the skies , and so the American reading public thought them very excellent indeed . Back in the great city , Lanny went on a hunt for an apartment for Nina and Rick , and thereby extended his distrust of the profit system into a new field . Owing to the housing shortage , Congress had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even hotel rooms at the prices which prevailed before the war . The effect of this had been to direct the mental energies of landlords and agents to originating devices to get money from would-be tenants for something that could n't be classified as rent . The landlord had just installed a fine piano in the apartment , and would Lanny 's friends be willing to pay fifty dollars a month extra for the use of this piano ? In another case , would they be willing to pay the agent a hundred dollars a month extra for his services in finding them a competent cleaning woman  --  this above what they would pay to the woman ? Lanny did n't mind paying a high price so much as he minded being forced to connive at breaking the law . After answering several ads and running into various forms of trickery , he decided that he would make use of that snobbery which he had discovered to be so powerful in Newcastle . He inserted in the most highly regarded newspapers an advertisementwith a box number , reading : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city with his wife , desires to rent comfortably furnished , centrally located apartment two months . Middle-agedcouple , no children , no pets . " Two days later there was a reply , offering him just what he wanted , not far from his own apartment . A telephone number was given , and he called it ; a pleasant woman 's voice answered and asked for the name of the prospective English tenants . Lanny replied that he did n't care to give the name of the tenants until he had seen the apartment and beer . told the price . They sparred for a while over this , and he was asked for his own name and gave a part of it , Mr. Lanning . The lady consented to meet him and take him to the apartment , and he met her in the lobby of a near-by hotel . She was young , well dressed , and smart , and devoted her smartness to trying to get him to name the baronet ; he in turn devoted his to an effort to persuade her to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred dollars a month , a price he was willing to pay . The effort was of no avail , and in the end she laughed and told him she did n't think he had any baronet , and she did n't have any apartment . She was a newspaperwomanwho had smelled a good story in the coming of a titled Englishmanwho was a well-known playwright ! The problem was solved by accident when Lanny mentioned his trouble to Zoltan Kertersi . The art expert said , " They can have my apartment . I am going to be away . " Zoltan had been invited to study and prepare a descriptive catalogue of the art collection of a wealthy retired banker in Princeton  --  none other than that Mr. Curtice who had given Lanny a hiding place while he was boning up on atomic fission . Mr. Curtice was going to the Adirondacks , and Zoltan would have his lovely old mansion with the smooth green lawns and white peacocks on them  --  all to himself except for some of the servants . " Come and seep321me , " Zoltan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads are better than my one . " In the midst of these small affairs came an event of electrifying importto the two rich friends of the poor : polling day in Britain , and the Potsdam Conference adjourned for three days to enable Winston Churchill and his large staff to fly back home to vote . Winston went  --  and he did n't come back . The most amazing thing , a parliamentary upsetthe like of which had never been known in British history . The common people of that land of hope and glory adored their war leader , but they did n't want him as a peace leader  --  a distinction that was clear to them but must have been confusing to Winnie . The Labour party obtained a majority of almost two to one ; they got it upon the basis of a definite program calling for the nationalization of the five most importantof the nation 's industries : coal , steel , transportation , communications , and finance . It was the program to which Nina and Rick had devoted the labors of their youth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and while Laurel was a later convert , she was none the less ardent . Their jubilation was unbounded , and they held a brief celebration over the transatlantic telephone . Alfy was " in , " and by a large enough vote so that he could speak with authority . And Winnie was " out "  --  and immediately , by the marvelous system which they have on that tight little island , where statesmen can get to London quickly . There was a new man flying to Potsdam to help decide the fate of Europe , a man by the name of Attlee , of whom few outside of Britain had heard ; a quiet , rather frail-looking man , with no booming voice and no polished periods ; but he knew what he wanted and had most of the British working class and a good part of the middle class behind him . So now it was possible to go ahead with the ending of war , and not merely in Potsdam but in London and New York . Nina and Rick had procured their passports and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave them six months , and then , if they wanted more time , they would make a new application . The land of the free and the home of the brave had become rather choosy in these later years . Lanny had to fly down to Washington to stir up the cookiepushersin the State Department , assuring them that a British baronet was really a Socialist and not a Communist , and that he was n't going to advocate the overthrow of the United States government by force and violence . A tense and exciting time in the world 's history , and nobody in his right mind could complain of being bored . The B-29S were keeping up their milk runs over Japanese cities , and the Navy 's task forces kept coming closer to Tokyo , shooting down the enemy 's suicide pilots and sending swarms of divebombers against ships and other targets . That was supposed to go on for a long time yet , perhaps a year or two ; but Lanny kept waiting for the big news that was due any day . His imaginationpictured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some island near Japan . Would they go by plane or by ship , and how long would it take ? Only a few persons knew , and none of these had given Lanny a hint . He developed the habit of turning on the radio every hour on the hour and looking at newspaper headlines whenever he passed a stand . He could n't give up the habit because , obviously , with each day that passed , A-day must be one day nearer . Everybody who knew anything about the A-bomb agreed that there was n't going to be any hesitation ; the enemy was going to learn about the bomb in action . Of course after that there would be no keeping the secret  --  the enemy would tell even if we did n't . The Potsdam Conference came to an end on the 2nd of August and a summary of its results was released . Japan was called on to surrender , and warned of dreadful things to come . Germany was to be divided into four zones , each to he governed by one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Union . To anyone who really wanted peace this arrangement was ominous , for it could mean only that the Big Four distrusted their ability to agree and had agreed upon a series of arguments and squabbles for an indefinite time . Each of the four would have its own idea of what Germany and the Germans ought to be and would proceed to make them over in its image : a Communist East Germany , a Socialist North-central Germany , a Big-Business , Private-Enterprise South-central Germany , and a Bourgeois Southwest Germany , hated , feared , and kept as poor as possible . President Truman came back to Washington and put the best face possible on what he had done . Most people thought he had been hoodwinked , and this would n't have been surprising , since he had had no previous experience with international affairs . America had the strangep323practice of putting its possible substitute President away on a shelf , as it were ; he had no special way to learn what was going on , and when his Chief suffered a massive brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands and say , " Look what 's fallen on me ! " On the 6th of August , a day never to be forgotten , Lanny turned on his radio . It meant having to listen to odious commercials , and he loathed them , but in times like these he had no choice . His heart gave a leap as he heard the announcer say , " Ladies and gentlemen , we interrupt the program to give you a statement which has just been issued from the White House , signed by the President of the United States . Give it your close attention . The statement follows . " He called to Laurel , who was pounding the typewriter in her room . She came running , and they listened to these portentous words : " Sixteenhours ago an American airplane dropped one bomb on Hiroshima , an important Japanese Army base . That bomb had more power than twenty thousand tons of TNT . It had more than two thousand times the blast power of the British Grand Slam , ' which is the largest bomb ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began the war from the air at Pearl Harbor . They have been repaid manyfold . And the end is not yet . With this bomb we have now added a new and revolutionaryincrease in destruction to supplement the growing power of our Armed Forces . In their present form these bombs are now in production , and even more powerful forms are in development . It is an atomic bomb . It is a harnessing of the basic power of the universe . The force from which the sun draws its powers has been loosed against those who brought war to the Far East . " So at last the secret was out , the secret that Lanny had been keeping from his family and friends for four years , the secret that had come near to burning a hole through his brain . Now at last he could tell Laurel where he had been in New Mexico and what he had seen there ; why he had set out on a plane four years ago and come near to losing his life ; what he had been doing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently . " Oh , what an awful thing ! " she exclaimed . " What an awful thing we have done ! " As usual , she thought about human beingsand failed to take the military attitude . " It makes our task more urgent , " she said , and Lanny answered , " It also makes it more possible , perhaps . " He telephoned his father . " Have you heard the news ? "  | " Someone in the office just told me , " was the reply . " So that 's what you 've been doing all this time ! " " Do n't mention it to anyone else , " he said . " There are reasons . " " This finishes Budd-Erling , " said the father . " They wo n't need us any more . " He never failed to take the business point of view ; but he would tell you it was the human point of view as well , for what was going to happen to those thousands of men and women he employed ? Laurel was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A paralyzing thing to know that such a horror was loose in the world , and that she had been living with it for the whole of her married life ! Of course Lanny had n't been allowed to tell her ; but what about those psychic gifts she thought she had discovered ? They had failed her so utterly just when they had the most important material to work on . Lanny brought her hack to earth . " Do n't forget that you have an eyewitness story , " he remarked , and her writer 's instinct began to stir . She went in and sat by her typewriter , and Lanny stretched out on the bed and started to talk , sentence by sentence , while her fingers flew over the keys . They agreed that the way to handle this thing was as a straight reporting job , with no attempt to elaborate or philosophize . Said Mary Morrow , " This is an account of what happened at the first atomic-bomb test at Alamogordo , New Mexico , as told to me by a friend who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of what Mary Morrow thought about it , or what her friend thought , there was what the different scientists and military men had said . When the job was done she was n't willing to entrust it to anybody else ; she stayed up part of the night to make a set of clean copies , and in the morning she took one to a newspaper syndicate . At the same time Lanny took a plane to Washington to carry out his promise to the Army . He had put on his uniform again , and that helped ; he had no trouble in seeing the right man . Since he was already familiar with what was called " Security , " there was n't much to object to ; a couple of phrases which the censor thought might be questioned , and Lanny agreed to change them . The OK was given , and the husband went out and phoned his wife . She reported that the syndicate had grabbed the story and was ready to put it on the wires the moment it was released . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time on the great seaport of Nagasaki . No one could say how many lives were destroyed , but the airmen took photographs , and these appeared in thep325newspapers and showed nothing left standing except a few heavy concretebuildings and part of some steel frames . It was said that the secondbomb was even more powerful than the first ; Lanny could guess that the material of one was U-235 and came from the Oak Ridge plant , while the other was plutonium and came from the Hanford plant . Everybody agreed that no civilized state could stand such punishment , and least of all Japan , whose cities were so largely of wood and paper . From Potsdam the United States , Britain , and China had issued a call to the last enemy to surrender , threatening " inevitably the utter devastation of the Japanese homeland . " Now the Japanese knew what that meant better than anybody else in the world . The toad beneath the harrow knows exactly where each tooth point goes ! The statesmenand their Emperor were also able to guess exactly where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Allies that the Emperor desired to surrender , but there was a question whether the fanatical military clique would let him ; they wanted to do what Hitler had done and go to their ancestors with glory . There was a plot to assassinate members of the cabinet and seize the person of the Emperor , but this was thwarted and the moderate party won out . On the day after the bomb was dropped over Nagasaki a message came to the government of Switzerland , saying that " in obedience to the gracious command of His Majesty the Emperor " the Japanese government was ready to accept the Potsdam terms , " with the understanding that the said declaration does not comprise any demand which prejudices the prerogatives of His Majesty as a sovereign ruler . " To this the United States replied next day that the authority of the Emperor would be subject to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers . Four days later the Japanese government bowed to these terms , and on the second of September millions of Americans listened over the radio to the elaborate ceremony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged on board the battleshipMissouri in Tokyo Bay . Such was the formal and dignified endingof World War II . There was a new world , so everybody felt . Decent people could breathe freely again and turn their thoughts to whatever interested them . Everybody in the Army wanted to get out and come home by the first ship , no matter how crowded . The Army worked out a system of points , based on the period of service , and the great war forces began to melt away ; the Queens brought double loads of men , one lot sleeping by night and the other by day , and nobody complained of the discomfort . Production would be shifted to civilian goods , rationingand price-fixing would be ended , taxes would be reduced , and everything would be the way it had been before the war , only much better . So the papers said . Nina and Rick were on the way ; and meantime Lanny went to work in the library of the Rand School of Social Science , learning about the history of American Socialism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refreshed his memory as to facts which he had almostforgotten . In his youth his great-uncle Eli Budd , a Congregationalclergyman and scholar , had told him a lot of things about the land of his forefathers . American labor did n't have to go to Marx and Engels , to Fourier and Proudhon , for its ideas of social reconstruction ; America had had its own thinkers from the earliest days , who had ideas in accord with American character and institutions . That did n't mean that students should be ignorant of European ideas ; they were necessary to the understanding of European problems and events . But to understand American problems and events one had to know American ideas , and this meant a knowledge of the writings of Robert Owen and Albert Brisbane  --  not Arthur , but his great and noble-minded father ; of Wendell Phillips and Horace Greeley , of Edward Bellamy and Henry George , of George D. Herron and Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Gaylord Wilshire and J. A. Wayland and Eugene V. Debs . These writers and many others had put American ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Americans , and had become the wellspring of innumerable movements and programs . Practically everything in Roosevelt 's New Deal had been included in the " immediate demands " of the Socialist party of America for thirty years , and the Tennessee Valley Authority had been the dream of every home-grown utopian since the invention of hydroelectric power . One of the formulas that Lanny had fixed in his mind was to " talk American . " This devastating war had left America the one country in the world that had money in quantity enough to speak and be heard . Whatever was going to be done to prevent the next war would have to be done with American support and under American guidance ; the task was to help the American people to know what to do . Second in importance would be the British people , and Rick would know how top327speak to them . As to the Russians , they had chosen to be an enigma , or rather their rulers had chosen that role for them ; what part they would take in the organization of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be known only when the thirteen men of the Politburo revealed it in action . Lanny Budd had been watching wars since the age of fourteen , asking questions and reading what the world 's accepted authorities had to say on the subject . He had made note of the many factors involved : the natural belligerence of the human male , a quality which had come down from his animal past ; the vast weight of ignorance and superstitionbrought from that same past ; the hatreds and prejudices which had been acquired through the centuries and the memories of wrongs which the peoples had committed and had suffered  --  it being human nature to remember the latter and forget the former . All these had played their part in the past and must be dealt with in the future . There were two other factors which in Lanny 's mind had come to assume predominance . The first was pressure of population , and for that there was but one permanent remedy , the universal knowledge and practice of birth control . Manifestly , if any species of living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself unchecked , it would in time cover the earth and leave no room to move about in . What had checked the human family was three things : pestilence , famine , and war . Modern techniques had suppressed the first two , and thus made the third the more inevitable and more deadly . Populations increased the faster , and the resort to the third remedy became more certain , quick , and extensive . The other major factor was the private ownership of the means of production and their use for private profit . This meant the exaltation of greed into the most powerful motive in human society . The survivalof the masses of any nation was dependent upon the ability of the private owners in that nation to find markets for their products ; so each nation was organized as an instrument of private greed , seeking raw materials and markets where the products could be sold at a profit . Failure to find either of these meant unemployment and starvation at home , with the threat of revolution . Driven by these fears , internationalrivalry grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure of population , the unemployment , and the threat of hard times . There was plenty of work until the damage had beenp328repaired , and then the old troubles would loom over the land once more . Under the system of production for profit a world war every generation was automatic . Rick and his wife arrived . Having been a successful playwright many years ago , and being now a baronet , he found the newspaper reporters on hand with their scratch paper and their questions . Had Sir Eric ever been to America before ? What had he come for now ? What did he think about the country ? What would he say about the British elections ? What hopes did he have for the United Nations ? The tall , slender Englishman , who had been dealing with newspapers all his mature life , revealed himself as a gracious and obliging person . He had decided that the future of the world lay in the keeping of the United States of America , and he had come as a student to learn what he could about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with awe at the demonstration of power America had given in the past four or five years . Britain was grateful for lend-lease  --  and so on . Yes , Sir Eric and his wife were members of the Labour party , and had campaigned in the recent elections ; their eldest son , Colonel Alfred Pomeroy-Nielson of the Royal Air Force , had just been elected to Parliament on the Labour ticket . No , Sir Eric had no plans to lecturein America , but might be happy to do so if invited . He would deal , of course , only with British and European subjects ; he would never feel himself competent to give advice to the people of any countrybut his own . So it went , and next morning all the newspapers were respectful , and the four conspirators felt that their enterprise had got off to a good start . One of the papers stated that the visitors would be staying at the Chiswick Arms , and before the morning was over there came a telephone call from the Rand School inquiring if he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the significance of the recent elections . Rick said he would be happy to do it , and he was , for this was the way to meet the intellectuals of Pinkish inclination and get started in the field of his endeavor . What neither Rick nor Lanny understood was the number of queer people there were in America , each with a cause of his or her own and the firm conviction that it was the most important cause in the world . Before that morning was over Rick had several callers , and each time he went down in the elevator to the reception room of this largep329apartment hotel . First , an elderly sweet-faced lady who was intercstedin a movement to forbid the use of animals in medical experiments ; she had a handbag full of pamphlets with horrifying pictures of things being done to dogs that might have been her own beloved pets . She besought Rick to read these , and she also pressed upon him a copy of the previous day 's Hearst newspaper , from which Rick learned that an immensely wealthy press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes on behalf of human beings , now was crusading-to let humanbeings perish in order to spare the feelings of dogs . The next was a threadbare old gentleman with trembling voice , who had had some difficulty in getting by the august , resplendent doorman of an apartment house just off Park Avenue ; he had said that he was a friend of Sir Eric , and it was true because he was a friend of all mankind . He had a plan to end poverty by what he called the " Bacon and Eggs Plan , " in order to distinguish it from the " Ham and Eggs Plan " which had been put on the ballot in California a few years before . It involved the distribution of paper money to the aged and needy , for both of which classes this gentleman appeared eligible . He was ready to start publication of a paper , he said , and all he wanted was for Sir Eric to put up the money . Also , before the day was over , there came a severe-looking , palefacedman about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rick . He had a trace of Swedish accent and announced in solemn basso pro-f undo , " I have a revelation direct from God . " " Indeed ? " said the Englishman politely . " What is it ? " " It is a manuscript , " replied the man  --  he had a large parcel under his arm . " And may I see it ? " asked Rick , still more politely . The answer was given in a voice as near like God 's as possible . " No human eve has ever beheld it . No human eye ever will behold it . " Rick took care in extracting himself from that situation , for he knew from ancient Hebrew days that God had sometimes given alarming instructions to his prophets . Rick gave instructions to the girl at the switchboard that in the future Sir Eric would receive visitors only by appointment and that strangers were to write and tell him what they %v anted . It took the couple no more than a day or two to get settled in Zoltan'scomfortable apartment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go out for one square meal each day and feed one another in picnic style for the rest . A cleaning woman would conic once a week , and the rest of the time they could have the two places to themselves . People who set out to change the world need all the time there is ; and perhaps if they knew in advance what a small amount of success they would have , they would n't make a start . However , it is clear that the world would never change at all if nobody tried to change it ; and you would have a hard time finding any adult person in the present world who would say that he or she was entirely pleased with things as they stood . What these four persons wanted was to put a set of important ideas before as large a number of people as possible ; and what was the best way to do it ? By the spoken voice ? They might all four have become lecturers and taken to the platform and the road . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been especially hard . They might write and publish books , or offer prizes for the best books by others ; but that too was a slow way , and the A-bomb had filled them all with a sense of urgency . Pamphlets were easier and quicker ; but how would you get then ' circulated ? In the old days people had read pamphlets ; Tom Paine had helped to make the history of America with his Common Sense and his The Crisis . But pamphleteering had been by-passed as the American way . What the masses in America read was newspapers and low-priced magazines ; also , they listened to the radio and went to the movies . If you wanted mass circulation , those were the ways to get it . They were all enormously expensive and conducted for the profit of private owners ; a genuine liberal among the owners was as rare as a white blackbird , and that was why opinion in America lagged so far behind mechanical development  --  including the aforesaid A-bomb . Lanny said , " Whatever we publish ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To which the experienced Rick replied , " The trouble with that is , everything the people are used to is produced on a mass scale , and to reproduce it on a smaller scale would be very costly . You could use up your million dollars in a few months . " " The people want to be entertained , and only a few want to be instructed "  --  thuspronounced Laurel . Such was the barrier , and to break through it was possible only to top genius , to which none of the four laid claim . Rick suggested gallantly that maybe Laurel had it ; anyhow , she was the only one of them who had managed to get mass circulationfor her work . " My plays were written for the carriage trade , " hep331declared . " You can laugh at such people , and make them enjoy it  --  if you are a Bernard Shaw ; but when you become too explicit they drop you  --  or the producer does it for them . " They needed figures and expert advice , but they distrusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fees and whose advice might be shaped by their own interests . Laurel went to her magazine editors , who thought highly of her and passed her on to others in the trade who had experience of different kinds . She also interviewed printers who could tell her about prices  --  and about the difficulties of getting paper in these times . Rick went to the Socialists , whose job was carrying on various kinds of small-scale propaganda ; they were glad to tell a British comrade about it , especially when he consented to write something about the miracle that had just been produced in his homeland . Rick found the American Socialists in a somewhat discouraged state because they had not been able to achieve either mass circulation or a mass vote . They were inclined to lay the blame upon F. D. R. , who had misled the masses with doles and delusive promises . They thought now that things would be going better for the party , because Harry Truman was turningrapidly to the Right , and the returning soldiers would surely be ready to consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got into his car and went scouting , first on Long Island and then among the Oranges  --  so called not because they grew there , but because the Dutch had been there . He wanted a place where they would have access to a moderate-sized library and where they could find a printing establishment , an office with half a dozen rooms , and a residence large enough  --  they had decided to keep house togethersince they got along so well and it was a nuisance visiting back and forth . These things were easier to find since the war had come to an end , and a lot of people had the idea fixed in their heads that there was going to be a slump and widespread unemployment . It had happeneda couple of years after the last war , and few of the rich put any faith in those taxing-and-spending techniques which they hated and which obliged them to earn their money over and over again instead of salting it away the first time they got it . That left Nina , and she did n't sit at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking very much the lady , went visiting the business offices of radio stations . She had the idea that the radio was a morep332important social force than her friends realized , and she did n't let herselfbe bluffed by the statement that the cost of a single coast-to-coast broadcast would be something like five thousand dollars for a single quarter-hour . Why did you have to reach two coasts ? Why not start on one and see what happened ? Maybe there were radio managers who were worried about business prospects too . The English lady discovered that there were a number of small independentstations in and around New York , and they were glad to talk with anybody who looked like money . They were not too choosy about programs ; if you paid for the time in advance you could oppose the vivisection of cats and dogs , you could advocate government printingand distribution of paper money , or you could tell about a revelationdirect from God . You could even advocate birth control , providedyou did n't go into detail as to how it was done  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No less important , some of these stations had friendly relations with others scattered over the northeastern part of the country , and they sometimes hooked up when they had a program of wider interest . You could build up a temporary chain that way , and if you had something the public really wanted you would accumulate a clientele ; have a regular period once or twice a week , and people would get into the habit of listening to you . For a thing like ending war there were thousands of people who would be interested , and if you had something convincing to propose you could ask them for money , and it might pour in . That was the way Father Coughlin had built up his influence , back in the twenties ; station by station , he had put together his radio chain , and it could still be done . " It do n't matter if it 's an idea or a soap powder , " was the slogan that Nina brought away with her . This research went on for several weeks , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty thousand dollars if they had bought it from one of the concerns specializing in business research . But they were learning by doing ; their questions awakened interest , and it was pleasant to discover how many business people showed an interest in the idea of ending war in the world and wanted to be told how it could be done . Americans , it appeared , were n't nearly as bad as their business system tried to make them . They were friendly and genial and glad to take time off to give information when they were approached in the right way . They even wanted to have their namesp333put down and to be informed when the enterprise got started . If the four had been soliciting subscriptions they might have taken in enough to keep them going . The lecture at the Rand School came off . This institution , founded by the wife of George D. Herron some forty years earlier , was dedicated to the cause of democratic Socialism . The Communists , dedicated to the cause of Socialism by dictatorship , hated the Rand School more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three blocks distant , and the organs of the rival parties gave n good part of their space to pointing out each other 's errors . The auditorium , which could accommodate close to a thousand , sitting and standing , was crowded that evening . The victory of the British Labour party was perhaps the most sensational event in the history of the movement . How had it been won , what did it signify , and what use would be made of it ? A good part of the audience was made up of Jews ; their fathers had been educated at this school . The families had moved to the Bronx or Brooklyn , and now the sons and daughters went to City College or Brooklyn College by day and to the hand School in the evening . They came with alert and eager faces , taking the intellectual life seriously ; the awful things which had been happening in Central Europe had made them into a thoughtful generation . The chairman explained that Sir Eric Pomeroy-Nielson had lost a part of one knee when he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War I ; therefore he was accustomed to speak sitting . He sat behind a small desk as if he were a college professor giving a lecture . He had known personally the men and women of two generationswho had built the British Labour movement : Keir Hardie , Ramsay MacDonald , Tom Mann , H. M. Hyndman , and the Webbs of the past , and Herbert Morrison , Ernest Bevin , Clement Attlee , Stafford Cripps of the present . Sir Eric himself had written for Labour papers and spoken at Labour meetings for the past quarter of a century ; he told how the movement had been built , how the workers had been educated , the extremists restrained , and a large part of the middle classes won over . He said that in his opinion this taking over of the British Commonwealth of Nations by its organized workers was the most important single event of modern times . What was Labour going to do with its victory ? It was going to dohat it had promised in an official campaign pamphlet which had beentidied by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nation 's industries into national properties , paying for them at thep334market price with government bonds . It would reorganize them , abolishingthe wastes of competition , and turn them to public service . It would do this in peaceable and orderly fashion under the constitution , without killing or robbing anybody . The task would n't be easy , for Britain had spent the greater part of her resources on the war and now was a poor country ; everybody would have to work hard and make sacrifices , and anybody who thought that Socialism was going to mean ease and luxury at once was doomed to bitter disappointment . The Labour movement would explain this to its people , as it had explained other problems and dangers in the past . What the Webbs had called " the inevitability of gradualness " was something that emanatedfrom the national temperament ; the British people were not extremistsor revolutionists , and they did n't trust people who bragged and made large promises . Said Sir Eric , " If you watch our movement for the next five years you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , no less and not much more . " The question period is the most interesting part of any lecture , and there were many who wanted to have their doubts cleared up , and , others , the Commies or fellow travelers , who wanted to put the speaker in a hole . Many of the questions had to do with the application of British tactics to America , and the speaker said he had no competence to discuss that . The general principle of achieving socialization by popularconsent would apply to all the peoples of the world who posessed democratic institutions and were accustomed to using them . That meant the Anglo-Saxon lands and the Scandinavian , also Belgium , Holland , and Switzerland . It would include France , Italy , and Czecho- , slovakia , provided that the Communists would allow it to happen , ' which he thought was doubtful . The Communists , who put an end to free speech wherever they can , found it suited their purposes in the Rand School auditorium . A bespectacledyoung woman arose and wanted to know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would permit the abolition of their privileges without forcible resistance . The speaker answered that they had already done it . The Coalition government was out and the Labour government was in , and Winston Churchill had already taken his place as leader of His Majesty 's Loyal Opposition . He would criticize and he would scold , as the free institutions of Britain permitted him to do ; but he would n't dream of sedition , and if in 1950p335the Labour party carried the elections with a program for further socialization , he would submit as he had done before , regretfully but politely . Again and again someone wanted to know how these lessons applied to America . Rick said that the problem was different because America 's political ways were different . America had the primary system , which enabled the people to select their party candidates by direct vote . That made it possible for the people to take possession of an old party and use it for a new purpose . By that means it had been possible for Roosevelt to take and use the Democratic party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers in a new , or third party . Then , of course , the fat was in the fire . What relationship did theNew Deal bear to British Socialism ? Lanny , who had placed himself t one side where he could watch the audience , saw that everybody was sitting forward on his or her seat ; this was the topic of debate of which you never heard an end in the Rand School . Sir Eric quoted the saying of an old-time British political leader , that the Tories had caught the Whigs in swimming and stolen their clothes . Rick said , " ' Ve Labour people have always felt that our business was to have our ideas stolen by our opponents . For half a century they have been taking our programs of social security and putting them into effect . You in America did n't feel the need of such measures until fifteenycars ago ; then the Democratic party began putting them into effect , nd I should think you would let the Republicans do the worrying about it . " 1 ) id the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? An earnest young girl student asked the question , and Rick smiled and said he would n't tell even if he knew , which he did n't . Americans knew their own institutions best , and they would n't need an Englishman to tell them how to go to work . An old-time Socialist whom Lanny remembered from the days when he had visited the Rand School before the great depression inquired whether the speaker thought there was any prospect of the socializationof basic industry in America . Rick said that basic changes would come only when there was basic need for them . American industry Was now at its peak of prosperity , and only when the next slump came would drastic action be forced . And did he expect a slump soon ? He answered that this depended upon whether international understandigcould be achieved . If there should be another war , of course there could be no slump ; even preparation for war would postpone it , perhaps for years.  | " So , " said the Englishman , " if our Communist friends who anticipatea slump are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country follow its normal boom-and-bust cycle , as it has been doing for more than a century . What I fear is that the Kremlin will yield to the temp tation to grab while the grabbing looks good . In that case they will compel the capitalist world to rearm , and thus will keep the capitalists in the saddle for nobody knows how much longer . " Oh , how mad that made the Communists ! They got up and started an argument , and the audience started to hiss and boo them . But Sir Eric said , " Let them ask their questions . We Englishmen are used to being heckled . It is a difference of opinion that makes horse races , and if nobody disagrees with me I 'd be sure I had n't said anything worth listening to . " So they laughed and listened , and the meeting was a success . PROFESSOR GOUDSMIT went to Washington to make a report , and then he came to New York and phoned Lanny . They had a lot to talk about , and he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had been the most closely guarded of secrets , was now something you could sit and chat about in drawing-rooms  --  and this the old-timers found hard to get used to . Nina and Rick came , and Lanny answered the Professor 's questions about what he had seen in New Mexico , and what Einstein had said , and Oppy , and the others ; all the things that had been top secret until the 6th of August . Goudsmit had been to Berlin , of which the American Army had taken over a sector in July . He drew a depressing picture of the center of that great capital , almost entirely destroyed ; the Russian artillery had done even more damage than the British and American bombs . That huge New Chancellery , which Hitler had built for a thousand years , was partly smashed and completely looted ; the garden , in whichp337the Fuhrer 's body was said to have been burned , was trampled and littered with junk , and the underground Fuhrerbunker was now a place for souvenir hunters . Only the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind bore clouds of plaster dust and the smell of burned wood and rotting bodies . The Alsos men , of course , were interested mainly in the Kaiser WilhelmInstitute , especially the building known as the Max Planck Laboratory . Several years ago Lanny had gone there as a pretended friend of the Nazis , in peril at every moment . He had talked with a grim old Prussian physicist , Salzmann , and had revealed to him secrets deliberatelydesigned to mislead him as to what the Americans were doing . It was a large building , two-and-a-half stories high , with a rounded corner and a tower , and having a basement with steel-barred windows opening to the street . Goudsmit reported that the place had been completelyplundered by the Russians ; they had taken even the electric wiring and the plumbing . They had dumped a lot of trash into the back yard , and there Alsos had found blocks of pressed uranium oxide , probably the most valuable property that had ever been in the place . In charge was the " Director of Intelligence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was in the sub-basement what appeared to be a swimming pool . Goudsmit recognized it as the " bunker laboratory " of which the German physicists had been so proud . The " swimming pool " was the sunken pit in which they had built their atomic pile , thinking it might become a bomb ; the metal frames which were to contain the uranium cubes were standing near by . Goudsmit called it " the physicists ' symbol of the defeat of Nazism . " Hardly less interesting was the story the Alsos head had to tell about the fate of the German scientists whom Lanny had helped to find and intern . They had been delivered to the American military , and apparentlythese non-scientific brass hats had n't known quite what to do with them . The British had kindly offered to take them off our hands , and so were getting the benefit of the best German brains . These brains were housed in a fine estate not too far from London , with a radio , a piano , a tennis court , newspapers and books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen the place , or even been told where it was , but he had talked with an English scientist who happened to be visiting them at the time the news of Hiroshima came over the radio . The re- action of the Germans was of utter incredulity : the American claim was absurd . The Germans were the people who knew better than anybody else in the world , for they had been trying and had made sure how difficult it was , impossible in that short space of time . The Americanshad no doubt invented some new and more powerful chemical explosive , and they were calling it " atomic " in order to frighten the Japanese . Dr. Goebbels ' fellow countrymen were familiar with that method of carrying on warfare . No , the so-called " atomic bomb " could have nothing to do with nuclear fission or with uranium  --  " oo-rahn , " as it is in German . The ten were so certain of it they could eat their dinner with enjoyment . But later in the evening came a more detailed report , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little world came to an end . For six years they had been working , and they had failed , while the despised Americans , the Jew-ridden upstarts , had succeeded . How dare the radio claim that Lise Meitner , a Jewess , had discovered uranium fission when everybody knew it was Otto Hahn , a pure Aryan German ? Most depressed of all was Walther Gerlach ; he had been in charge and was the one who would carry the blame for all time . He sat with his head in his hands and talked as if he were contemplating suicide ; his colleagues had to gather round and argue him out of it . They tried to interest him in the problems that were tormenting them , the statementsover the radio that made no sense at all . What was this talk about heavy water , and the pride the Allies took in having destroyed the Rjukan plant in Norway ? Heavy water could be used in making an atomic engine , but surely not a weapon ! To the Germans the word " bomb " meant the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Planck Laboratory 's sub-basement , an atomic pile . What was it the Americans used in place of heavy water , and how on earth had anyone managed to get an atomic pile into the air ? The stuff was heavy , heavier than lead , and had to be protected with heavy lead shields . No plane ever built could have carried such a load . Could they have used fast neutrons in pure uranium ? But that would have made it even heavier . Or had they been able to separate uranium-235 ? But how was this possible in just a few years ? And what was this nonsense about plutonium ? There was no such element as plutonium . Did the ignorant newspaper and radio people perhaps mean protoactinium ? This would make a bomb , but there was n't enough of the substance in the whole world . Hour by hour the ten listened to the world-shaking news , and littlep339by little their leading theoretical man , Heisenberg , was able to solve the mystery . The atomic pile was n't the bomb ; it was merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more highly radioactivesubstances . That must be what the talk about plutonium meant . A new element ! And new isotopes ! How had the Germans ever failed to discover the clue , and how could their science stand such a blow to its prestige ? It began to dawn on these renowned gentlemen that they were safe and comfortable where they were . If they went back to Germany it might occur to some of the frenzied werewolves to punish them for the humiliation they had brought upon their native land ! There came a letter from Beauty with interesting news . The Army 's wonderful sleep-talking machine had brought back Marceline 's memoryalmost completely . They had got her a set of dental plates , and she was able to eat normally and had regained her strength . They had refrained from asking her questions about painful events , but the day had come when she chose to talk to her mother about them . There had been several different plots against Hitler 's life , and hundreds of Reichswehr officers and officials of the old regime had known about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stumble on a new clue , and there would be new arrests and shootings of the guilty , and often of those whose ill luck it was to be related to the guilty or acquainted with them . All Marceline knew was that she had been sittingquietly one afternoon in front of the cottage she had rented on the grounds of what had been a girls ' school and was now a hospital for wounded officers . She was enjoying the sunshine when she heard a low whistle and saw an elderly war cripple who worked as gardener on the place beckoning to her from the doorway of her home . She got up and went inside , and the man whispered the dreadful news that the Gestapo was coming for her ; they had stopped in a near-by village cafe to have lunch , and a waitress had overheard their talk . Being the daughter of this old gardener , and having heard of Marceline 's kindnessto him , the girl risked her life to telephone her father . Marceline stopped only long enough to . put on her hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the old man . Being fond of walking , she knew the paths about this neighborhood and was able to get away unobserved . She got to a town and phoned Lanny at the Berlin hotel inhere he was staying ; then she sought refuge in the home of friends , and they kept her in their attic for a couple of weeks . A servant mustP340have betrayed her ; the Gestapo men came and took her and the whole family to the old red-brick jail on the Alexanderplatz in Berlin . At first they pretended to be friendly . They told her they had arrestedher lover and had him in this same jail ; he had confessed everything , including the fact that she and Lanny had known about the plot . Of course the statements about Oskar might be true or not , Marceline had no means of knowing . They told her they realized she had taken no active part in the conspiracy , and all they wanted of her was to know the whereabouts of her half-brother . She said she had no idea and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone call and confronted her with that , and all she could say was the truth , that she had no idea where Lanny would go . Of course they did n't believe her and tortured her near to death in the effort to wring the secret from her . They told her that her lover was being tortured too and that there would be no respite for either of them until she gave up . " Perhaps I might have , " Marceline said , " but I could n't tell what I did n't know . " So in the end they quit and put her in with the herd of women who were driven every day to the underground munitions plant in Leipzig , to slave until they died . Such was the answer to the riddle that had been troubling Lanny 's mind for two years . He did not get the last detail of it until another year , when he had access to the Gestapo 's voluminous records and learned that Oberst Oskar von Herzenberg had been taken to Lichterfelde . There in the courtyard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Purge of 1934 , the handsome , arrogant Junker had been hanged . Rick 's talk in the Rand School and his article in the New Leader served the purpose of launching him in that movement for social change which it is difficult to name because it has many different groups and labels . The two Budds and the two Nielsons sought the advice of older and more experienced campaigners for peace and social justice , and found that the town was full of them . All appeared pleased to be asked for their opinions and would start to pour out ideas , always with positiveness . The only trouble was the ideas differed so ' much and often were contradictory . However , certain types emerged , the most common being the " tired radical . " Always he was the idealist who had grown gray in the service of his cause , and the high hopes with which he had started hadP341failed of realization . Perhaps he had hoped for too much and in his disappointment was unable to realize to what extent his program had actually been accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so slowly that the day-by-day observer had no way to notice it ; there was no social thermometer by which you could get the exact measure of progress . It was amusing to notice how each of these war-worn veterans advisedyou to eschew the activity in which he himself had made his career . The writer of pamphlets said , " Do n't write pamphlets , there is no way to get them circulated . " The writer of books said , " People do n't read serious books any more ; the radio and the week end at the farm have put an end to reading . " The orator said , " People do n't come to meetings any more ; they stay at home and drink gin and listen to imbecile shows . " The editor said , " For God 's sake , do n't try a paper . The slicks and the pulps have all the stock and the advertisingand circulation ; you 're licked before you start . " Yes , there was need of a thermometer , a clock , a Geiger counter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propaganda and to help social-reform writers and publishers and editors keep up their spirits . Somebody was needed to point out to them that even though they had had to quit , they had not failed entirely . If they had published sound ideas and had found readers , their ideas would live in other minds and spawn and reproduce themselves after the manner of ideas . Alfred Bingham , sensitive and high-minded son of a former governorof Connecticut , had published a little monthly called Common Sense . Now he said , " A dozen years as editor and publisher left me with a feeling of futility . No magazine in my line has had a noticeable effect on events , except perhaps for Henry Luce 's . " To which Laurel answered , " But I read your magazine and learned a lot from it . Why do you assume that I have forgotten it ? " This cheered the good soul not a little . It was n't so different with the New Leader , a twelve-page weekly . aper that was still speaking for the Left Wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . The four newcomers invitedthe staff to a dinner in a private room and told them about the problem they were facing . The editors were generous in their attitude ; they had no fear of competition  --  the harvest was plenteous and the laborers were few . But on the whole they were discouraging as to xt hat could be accomplished . William Bohn , most amiable of veterans , expressed himself : " Anything really good in the way of a movement or publication will require much more than a million dollars . " When Laurel referred to the so-called " Garland Fund , " a million dollars which a young man had donated to the cause of social justice , the editorgave his verdict : " The world would be just as well off if young Garland had spent his money on chorus girls . " In all these researches the " Peace " group , as they had taken to callingthemselves , were careful to preserve the roles they had agreed upon . Sir Eric could be himself , and so could his wife : he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Morrow was the lady of mystery and money ; a popular writer , eccentric in that she refused to wear high-heeled shoes or to smear red grease on her lips  --  but then writers are allowed a certain amount of oddity , and so are rich persons . Mr. Budd was her gentleman friend who sat quietly listening , now and then asking a question but never arguing , and leaving you to assume that he was n't much of a personality . Rick was the brains and did the talking ; it was natural that , having never been in America before , he should be trying to understand the country and its ways . Talk about him spread , and before long it reached the press . Who reporters came Sir Eric was tactful , as ever . He had recognized th fact that New York had become the intellectual as well as the financi center of the world , and he was feeling out the possibility of getting together a few friends of international order , to speak and write o behalf of progressive and humanitarian ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along the lines of the United Nations  --  which had made up its mind to settle somewhere in the Unit States , if the country would have them . Such interviews brought more letters and more visitors , and already a card file was accumulating ; a secretary and a temporary office ha . to be engaged . Rick and Nina did the interviewing , while Lanny wen to the library and continued his research . He wanted to know all there was to know about the collectivist ideas and movements in the past o , his country . There was little about it in the regular histories , but the was a vast special literature , now mostly forgotten . At the turn of the century there had been a Socialist monthly , Wilshire 's Magazine which had achieved a circulation of three or four hundred thousan It was run by a " billboard " man from Los Angeles who had made fortune and then been converted to the new-old religion of hum brotherhood . The experts in the publishing field had told him that he got a circulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't so . Big advertisers would have nothing to do with a publication whose slogan was " Let the nation own the trusts . " Wilshire 's died when its owner 's money was gone . There had also been a weekly paper , Appeal to Reason , with a circulationof more than a million . This paper had been started by a realestatedealer named J. A. Wayland , who had fifty thousand dollars to spare and bought a press . He built up the paper by the policy of supportingthe cause of labor , right or wrong , and of never asking for donations but only new subscriptions . World War I wiped it all out , and the " little old Appeal " was remembered only by a few old-timers . It took the researcher no little trouble to find out that the former editor of the Appeal , Fred D. Warren , was living in Kansas , a retiredowner of oil leases . Rick wrote to him , expecting to get advice as to the launching of a paper in these new times . The reply he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no possible chance to build up a circulation of a weekly or monthly that would reach the folks we need to reach . Only by the media that are now established can we do the job quickly . I would buy space in such widely circulated magazinesand newspapers as would accept the things I wrote . I would use material from the columns of the old Appeal , because I am convinced that Wayland had the right ideas as to what was wrong and what should be done . " When Nina read that she remarked , " In other words , we turn our million dollars over to the capitalist press and increase its power ! " Lanny added , " Whatever we have , it must surely be our own . " For many years a presidential agent had been dealing with men of action , those who held power and determined immediate events . Now he was meeting with men of ideas , who were trying to determine the future . Very certainly Franklin Roosevelt would never have been able to launch his New Deal if men such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought for a couple of generations . When you tflet the sowers , and discovered what a variety of seeds they carried , you were better able to understand the confusion and groping of the early New Deal . It might be true that in the multitude of counselors there was safety , but there was also an appalling amount of waste . The four called in a quiet and conscientious thinker who had been troubled by this confusion . After publishing a number of Socialist books , Stuart Chase had taken up an English notion called " semantics , " P344and spent an evening explaining to the quartet the importance of knowing the meaning of the words you used in talking about social problems . Early in the century the Russian revolutionists had invited the soldiers to shout for a constitution , and they had done so gladly , having the impression that Constitutza was the Tsar 's mistress . And now the sons of these same men were shouting for a thing they called " Democratzia , " understanding by it that they voted a ballot which had only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in social reform was " more light and less power . " He said , " Too many reforms amount to attempts at predictingwith insufficient data , and if such predictions ever work in the social field it is by accident . " He admitted that a more even distributionof goods throughout the world would be a big help for peace , but added , " Nobody yet knows how it can be achieved , in a realistic political way . " When Rick suggested that perhaps they had n't time to make the elaborate investigation proposed , the answer was , " We have n't time not to . " After their guest had departed the two couples sat discussing his point of view . Rick , who had lived through the rough and tumble of British politics for most of his life , exclaimed , " Insufficient data , my eye ! You have the data of a score of depressions in a century and a half . You have the data that with each depression thousands of little businessmen were forced into bankruptcy , and millions of workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have the data that a hundred men , or maybe two hundred , have incomes of a million dollars a year . What more data do you need in order to know that your society is in a state of perpetual civil war , with strikes and revolts and crime waves and all the other products of a blind competitive system ? " That was the way the impatient ones talked . Another impatient one was Emanuel Haldeman-Julius , editor and publisher from the Middle West . They heard that he was in town and sought him out ; they found in him the first and only man who still believed in the pamphlet as a weapon . He went into a sort of ecstasy over the very word . " A pamphlet is cheap , effective , and popular with the masses . It is not big enough to frighten them off . A pamphlet gets its job done because , if it is properly written , it covers a theme thoroughlyand brings the reader to a definite conclusion . A pamphlet has the power to move mountains . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't make the mistake of wasting your money on fat , expensive books . Learn from the work of Voltaire , Paine , Ingersoll , Kropotkin , Goldman , Debs , and hundreds of others . You must go to your job with the passion and sincerity of Diderot , d'Holbach , and the other French encyclopedists . You must take all culture as your field  --  politics , economics , finance , social evolution , free thought , anti-clericalism , democracy , science , history , philosophy . You must conduct the greatest battle of the pamphlets in all history . The people have been misled and confused , and you must rebuild their minds ; they will come to you with the innocence of children , and you must give them understanding . The encyclopedists brought enlightenment to the top layers of society ; a set of their books cost about two hundred dollars . They found their readers even in the palace of the King , and among skepticalmembers of the Church hierarchy . Theirs was a revolution from the top , an aristocratic movement ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You have the brains and the money , and you can buy the right machinery and the know-how . You have a staggering opportunity ! " This lover of cheap books spoke as one having authority , having made himself the greatest creator of pamphlets in history . He had sold more than three hundred million " Little Blue Books " at the price of five cents each , which meant that he had handled fifteen million dollars . He had more than twenty-five hundred titles , including every subject of importance you could think of . He advertised this list in ; ill the important magazines and newspapers that would accept his ropy  --  many would n't because his list included attacks on superstition and clerical power . In course of time his list had come to include eight hundred " Big Books " also ; his was a going concern , and he was the one man who had been able to make money out of selling the masses What were supposed to be unpopular ideas . This dreamer of unlimited education ended his excited discourse with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so is the idea of a million dollars . Even though I do n't expect to touch any of it , still it works on both my mind and my senses . I have a nose for news , and another for money . " This large and prosperous lover of books went on to relate amusing stories of what he had learned about his business . He had published a short story by Maupassant entitled " The Ball of Tallow " and had sold fifteen thousand copies a year ; then it occurred to him to give it a different title , and as " A French Prostitute 's Sacrifice " it sold nearly four times as many . Theophile Gautier 's Fleece of Gold sold only five thousand a year , but when it became In Quest of a Blonde Mistress its sales were multiplied by ten . That was n't supposed to be ethical , or at any rate dignified , but the publisher 's conscience did not trouble him . " The people get a recognized masterpiece , and they learn something about the world they live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature means to people who are poor . I began earningmy living as a boy , driving an elevator in a school , and I devoured good literature in between passengers . I read books and wrote books a long time before I began selling them , and when I sell a thousand I am reading every copy in my imagination . " Then came another Jew and another book lover : Sam de Witt , oldtimeNew Yorker , old-time tennis champion , a poet who published his own poems and plays , and a prosperous dealer in tools and machinery . Sam was one of the five elected Socialists who had been expelled from the New York legislature during World War I. He was in his midfiftiesnow , but as full of liveliness as ever . He knew all about the different " causes " in New York and the quarreling party lines . He becameeloquent as he described the situation . " There is the curse of the angle . ' Having edited a Socialist weekly for years , and in that time read Communist , Trotskyist , anarchist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sociological publication , I learned to distinguish a clipping without reference to its source . Wording and tone fell into their pattern at once , whether dealing with the future ut the Swedish thermos bottle or the holy tetractys of Pythagoras . Each publication developed a planetary system , around whose hub some twenty to forty thousand votaries swirled or trailed in self-righteous assurance . " Rick ventured mildly , " It has been our hope that we can hold ourselvesabove party and faction . " To which the answer was , " To do that you will have to hold yourselves so high that nobody will know you are there . " The speaker went on to tell the sad story of Marshall Field , **26;3908;TOOLONG , who had subsidized an afternoon newspaper called PM . He had succeeded in fusing some of these rival groups into a circulation of a hundred and fifty thousand ; as Sam classified them , " Forty thousand Stalinists , twenty thousand Socialists with various shades of hatred of Joe and all his works , five thousand Trotskyists ,  |p347and  the rest confused goodhearted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luce and the rest of our press masters . The paper has lost several times as much money as you lads and lassies have to put into the pot . Here you are with one million dollars , proposing to save two billion human beings who are standing on the verge of extir-pation . " " What would you advise us to do ? " asked the American " lassie , " not without a touch of acid in her tone . The discouraged Socialist thought for a bit and then said , " I can tell you  --  but you wo n't do it . " " Give us a chance , " urged Rick . " All right . You rent yourselves a large tract of land somewhere out beyond the Jersey marshes and put a heavy steel fence around it and turn loose a lot of savage dogs to guard it . You erect some low , flat , sinister-looking buildings and take extraordinary precautions to swear all the workingmen to secrecy . You install a lot of queer machinery which I can buy for you  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit . Gradually rumors will spread , and reporters will come ; you tell them that you have employed the world 's greatest physicist , and he has discovered a process for producing atomic fission in ordinary rock , and so you are going to make the world 's most awful bomb . This is a free country , and you do n't have to let anybody into your plant that you do n't want to . Gradually awe and terror spread  --  nobody doubts that you have something , because who would spend a million dollars on nothing ? That is reasonable , is n't it ? " " And then ? " " This goes on for three or four years , until the whole world knows about your project and the suspense has become extreme . By that time the United Nations will be on the verge of its final break-up . You come before them and say , Gentlemen , there is not to be another war . I have decided to save you the trouble . I have created a rock bomb that will destroy everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chain reaction in all the rock in the earth . I have a dozen of these bombs , and my agents have them hidden in a dozen of your great cities  --  New York , Washington , London , Paris , and , believe it or not , Moscow and Leningrad . I give you one week in which to submit your dispute to the arbitration of the World Court , to abolish all armed forces and all national boundaries an international government run by the majority vote of the nations here present . If you do n't take this action the bombs will go off at the same instant in all the different places . They will be time bombs , and the agents will have time to escape . Nor will it do you any good to arrest me , for in that case my agents have orders to get the bombs started , and may God have mercy on your dumb souls ! " They all had a chuckle ; and Laurel , somewhat mollified , remarked , " You ought to make that into a play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " countered the tool merchant , " will you use part of your million dollars to produce it ? " All this was America , and they were learning about it at first hand . For Rick , all the reading of his lifetime was not equal to this face-tofacecontact . He found the American accent fascinating ; he was amused to note that whereas the Americans all knew he had an Englishaccent , they were surprised to learn that they had an American accent . It is , apparently , the habit of all peoples to assume that the earth revolves around their particular spot on it . " Everybody but thee and me is queer , and sometimes I have doubts about thee . " For Lanny , too , these encounters were stimulating . For nearly a decade he had had no personal contact with the movement he had been trying to serve . He had been living in the enemy 's country , not merely physically but ideologically ; he had been living capitalism and luxury , while cherishing democracy as a secret dream . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their talk and observe what life had been doing to them , and especially what war had been doing to them . There had been more than ten years of war , for it had begun in Spain , and even before that , when Hitler had advanced into the Rhineland . For anyone with a critical sense it is easier to love the people in imagination than in reality . These " radicals , " these " Leftists , " or whatevername you chose to give them , were opinionated persons and did n't mind repeating themselves over and over  --  they could n't have carried on their work otherwise . They had strongly developed egos , and strong resistance to other egos . Along with their sense of justice it was possible for them to have more or less envy ; they would have had to be superhuman in order not to enjoy having a little success , even a little luxury in their lives . Those who had forced their way upward in the world had found it rough going , and they had n't always had time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some did n't have good table manners , and some did n't always remember to P349brush the dandruff off their coat collars . In short , a leisure-class personcould find numerous reasons for disapproving of them . These facts stood out when the leisure-class person took a day off and went among his own sort . Lanny and Laurel took Rick and Nina up to Newcastle ; a delightful drive in bracing autumn weather , and there was a large household , living in accord with completely accepted conventions which removed all friction and made every human contactagreeable . Nobody tried to force his opinions upon you ; nobody forced anything upon you , you were assumed to know what to say , what to do , what to wear , what to eat and drink . If it was golf , you knew how to play ; if it was cards , you would n't dream of cheating ; if it was at the table , you knew how to hold your knife and fork , and you were offered a second helping once and only once . Friction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course it existed ; Lanny told his friends about bitter family quarrels , but no visitor would ever see a trace of them . There was the story of a haughty Budd dame who had said to her husband , " Take me into the closet and spit on me if you must , but show respect for me when we are in public . " The way Lanny got along with the highly developed egos of the wealthy was to let them say their say and never oppose them . What was the use ? You could never change them , only make them angry . Rick and Nina had grown up on this course , and so the four dwelt in the enemy 's country , ate the enemy 's food , listened to the enemy 's conversation , and conformed to the enemy 's proprieties . The enemy became a friend , and all the Budd tribe came in to meet a British baronet ( genuine ) and his wife ( also genuine ) . There was a tea for them at the country club , where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on as guests indefinitely . But after three days of it they were bored and wanted to get back to that uncomfortable world where crude , imperfect people argued and squabbled over party lines and programs . ( Incidentally , Baby Lanny had the measles and was shut up in a darkened room , and Frances had gone back to England with her mother ; so two reasons for staying were canceled . ) The work of delving into the American mind went on . Lanny looked into the story of the Garland Fund , an experiment which came closest to the one he was planning . Some twenty years ago a young radical had inherited from his father a share of a fortune and had announced t hat he did not believe in the right of inheritance and would not touchP350 it . Thereupon his fellow radicals and mentors had gathered about and persuaded him that this was a mistake ; if he refused the money others would get it and make no good use of it . How much more sensible to take the money and turn it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had changed his mind . He would keep a quarter of a million for himself and give the rest , slightly over a million , to a trusteeship called the Garland Fund , directed by tried and true friends of social justice . There had followed a process of consulting and planning , like that which the Lannys and the Ricks were carrying on . Gifts were made to civil liberties and labor groups , and a large sum went into the reprinting of cheap editions of the classics of the social protest movement . Lanny collected all the details that were available . A total of fifty volumes had been agreed on : Tolstoy and Kropotkin and Lenin , Marx and Proudhon , Blatchford and Ruskin , Shaw and Wells , Paine and Veblen and Jack London , Henry George and Lester Ward  --  a widely varied list . They had been made available in large editions at fifty cents a copy , and the question was , how many people had they reached and what had they accomplished ? Seeking this information , Rick went to see the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Garland Fund  --  only to learn that the man was now engaged in private business and was of the opinion that the only enterprise worth considering was the overcoming of " the great totalitarian sweep " that was under way . " Assuming that that is true , " said the baronet , " how are we going to set about it ? If we try to do it with capitalism , we will presently find ourselves the ally of Franco and the Catholic hierarchy , of Greek royalty and the Chinese landlords and moneylenders ; in short , of reaction everywhere in the world . It will be one kind of totalitarianism against another , and we democrats will lose out either way . The only way to fight Communist totalitarianism is to show the people how they can get a just co-operative order by peaceable means . That way we can get all the peoples of the world on our side , including those whom Stalin is taking over by force ; in the end we may win even the Russian people . " But it was of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer time for anything of the sort ; the Communist menace was too immediate . Next they got the name of a man who had assisted with the Garland Fund books . What would he have to report ? Again Rick paid a call , and he heard the opinion , " World War III seems to me so certain , soP351absolutely inevitable , that it seems to me far more constructive to devote ourselves to preparation for winning it than to attempts to prevent it . For if this country loses World War III , I foresee a dark age that will last for at least five centuries . " This time Rick avoided arguing . He was dealing with a publisher in active business and could ask definite questions . The man pointed out that anyone who tried to sell low-priced serious books faced tremendouscompetition from magazines , both slicks and pulps , from comic books , from twenty-five-cent mysteries , and so on . He had found it easier to sell quantities of old books that had stood the test of time than to sell anything new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of radical publications were sold to radicals , which meant that the works had little effect on the general public . Finally he spoke these depressing words : " No consideration of this kind would be honest if it failed to take into account the damned low intelligence quotient of a considerable segment of the American public . How large this segment is , and how low its intelligence quotient is , I leave for others to say , but any study of the extremely popular radio programs will prove that the programs with the highest rating , with extremely few exceptions , are directed at the ten- to twelve-yearoldmind . " Variety is said to be the spice of life , and certainly it was making life spicy for these four . They made notes on each set of opinions and tried to classify them , but it could n't be done  --  there were so many more differences than agreements . They saw themselves in the position of the farmer and his son in the fable of Aesop , trying to get their donkey across a bridge . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they tried to please everybody , with the result that they pleased nobody and lost their donkey into the bargain . Lanny and Rick , according to their temperaments , were disposed to concentrate upon economics ; but Laurel ranged farther afield and invited a young poet who had been present at the New Leader dinner . Richard Armour contributed brief satiric verses to the paper , and now lie said , in substance , " I hope that your economics will be politicosocialand not merely the economics of price and distribution . I understandthe feeling that if physical wants could be supplied , everywhere in the world , everything might be well . But I am increasingly distrustfulof a world dominated by economists and scientists , who make usP352comfortable  --  and narrow and dull and thankless . Your publications should have a column of relief from material things . " Here was a new angle , and Laurel decided to look into the spiritual side of their task . The American people were religious by tradition , and there had been a Christian Socialist movement of great influence . Becausesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landlords and moneylenders was not sufficient reason for going over to the atheists . As Bernard Shaw had said of his own early career , he had thrown out the baby with the bath , and now he had lived to be ashamed of his folly . There was a minister in New York to whom all thoughts turned when it was a question of applying the religious impulse to political and social affairs . John Haynes Holmes had been for years the pastor of a Unitarian church in a fashionable part of the city ; after World War I he had made it a " Community Church . " He had been a pacifist through the two most dreadful wars in history ; he had defended the rights of oppressed minorities and been a tower of strength for civil liberties . His voice was familiar on all forum platforms ; he would say , " I am no orator "  --  and would say it oratorically . Now to his study came two ladies , one American , the other English , and introduced themselves . They told him of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ardor of an old crusader blazed up in his soul ; yes , he knew exactly what to tell them to do . " You and your husbands must make a pilgrimage to Gandhi . He is the one who has the gospel ; his way is the way to put an end to war . " They were surprised , and Dr. Holmes expatiated . He was planning himself to make a pilgrimage to this shrine ; the Mahatma was frail and it was hardly likely that he would last much longer . He was the true " Great Soul " of modern times ; in his shrunken hands he held the secret of the future . His technique of non-violent resistance was the truly spiritual , and at the same time a political , doctrine . It had been prepared in solitude , with fasting and prayer , and had been tried out in the rough and tumble of mass struggle . All the power of the British Empire had been unable to prevail against it ; in the end the proud rulers had bowed before it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to world peace lay in a study of this technique and its application to the affairs of Western imperialism . All this was interesting , but the wife of an English baronet could hardly be expected to swallow it without some gagging . Said she , " Do n't you think , Dr. Holmes , that at least a part of the credit for Gandhi 's victory might be given to his opponents ? You must know , that the British treated him with the utmost tenderness ; when they arrested him he had every comfort , and care such as he could have had only in a modern hospital . " " That may be true , Lady Nielson  --  " " Suppose for a moment that it had been with the Nazis he was dealing . Do you think he could have driven them out of India ? They would n't have waited for him to open his mouth ! They would have put him in a poison-gas chamber and burned his body in a furnace and scattered his ashes to the winds . His followers would n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , but his message  --  " " They would have slaughtered every one of his followers , they would have burned his writings  --  " " You can not burn a message , Lady Nielson . That was proven in the case of Jesus . The blood of the martyrs was the seed of the Church . All through the ages  --  " " But we are not talking about the ages , Dr. Holmes , we are trying to prevent the destruction of our present world in an atomic war . We have to use the symbols and the mechanisms that our people understand , here and now . " " Mechanisms are one cause of our trouble ; we have built so many that they have become more important than men . The machine is the master of our world . " Nina would have liked to ask this friend of mankind whether he used a car in the course of his pastoral duties , and whether he took the subway when he had to speak at " Town Meeting " on Manhattan Island . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no need to travel to India to find a " Great Soul " ; this was one  --  but , like his Hindu exemplar and many others throughout this ugly world , he found difficulty in keeping his actions in accord with his holy faith . There were great numbers of sacred creeds taught and solemn rites practiced in this megalopolis ; they were contradictory , and could n't all be true . The skeptical Rick was sure that no one of them would have any better solution to offer . Some might try to send the researchersto Rome , some to Mecca , and some even to Tibet . These faiths had had centuries in which to show what they could do to bring peace on earth ; they had brought innumerable wars  --  never more bloody than when they were carried on in the name of the Prince of Peace .   There were a number of modern religions which originated in America , and had their churches and groups of devotees in New York . One of them was based upon faith in immortality , as something real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The souls of the dead existed , and it was possible to communicate with them ; it was n't just fraud but something that could be proven and practiced . Laurel had talked with Nina about the strange gift of mediumship , and Nina knew about an old-time English medium who had settled in New York . Eileen Garrett was publishing a monthly magazine , Tomorrow , so there were two reasons for consulting her ; she could tell them about costs and other business matters , and maybe the spirits would also make their appearance and have advice to give . This was just after their evening with Haldeman-Julius , and Laurel said with a smile , " We wo n't tell him about it ! " They wrote , introducing themselves , a playwright 's wife and a woman novelist who was a medium . Naturally the editor was interested , and they called at her office , and later she came for an evening . Mrs. Garrett , retired head of the British College of Psychic Science , began by telling them the surprising news that Emily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Federation group to which a rich woman had just bequeathed a million dollars to be used in the effort to prevent the next war . " Indeed and indeed ! " said Laurel . " We shall have to get in touch with those people and find out what they are going to do . " Then , unannounced and still more surprising , came a remark to Nina . " You have been having trouble with delayed menstruation , and you have been afraid of the possibility of cancer . " " How wonderful ! " exclaimed the younger woman . " It is true . " " You do n't need to worry about cancer , for you do n't have it . " " How can you know that , Mrs. Garrett ? " " I do n't know how ; it has been happening to me all my life . The moment a person comes into my presence and I touch his hand , somethingcomes to me . I give it instantly , spontaneously , and that puts me in touch with people , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have found it a wonderful thing in my life , for it makes human relationships light and easy . I do n't need a couch and a dark room to persuade people to tell me what 's in their hearts . " So this was a clinic as well as a magazine office , something of a noveltyin a commercial world . It was something of a church too . Said the editor , " Everyone , from the President of the United States to the street cleaner outside the White House , is in need of a new religion . P355The dollar sign is not enough . Men earn their first thousand , and then they strive for five thousand , and it 's a rat race until they get a million . Cars , refrigerators , and a hundred luxuries do not make peace of mind ; neither Russia nor America has it today . People sense that Gandhi has it and speak of him as a saint . He is a shrewd politician who has the clarity of goodness ; but I have no doubt that future generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nina and Laurel looked at each other and smiled . They told this unusual editor about their talk with Dr. Holmes , and she said , " You do n't need to travel to India . God is here also . All you need is to believe in spiritual power without dogma or superstition , and you have it . Tell people that , and they will pay more heed to what you say about peace and social justice . " THE wars were over , and into all the harbors were coming transports loaded with men . For a weary year or two , or perhaps three or four , these men had been looking forward to the hour when they would set their feet on the soil of God 's country , and now they slapped one anotheron the back and shouted or laughed for joy . They , the lucky ones who had returned , had money in their pockets and girls waiting for them . Many of the girls had money too ; they had been earning as much as two dollars an hour in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lively phrase had it . Only a thoughtful student of economics could understand the hiddenforces that were conspiring to cause this happiness to fade and these bright hopes to turn gray . It was n't anybody 's devilment , but just the normal operation of a competitive business system , so highly lauded in newspaper and magazine editorials . The country was flooded with money , and goods were scarce ; prices were bound to be forced up , and those who had the most money would , as always , be the first to be served . Government statistics , based on wholesale prices for basic commodities , would show a gradual rise ; but that would n't mean anything to the housewife , who knew that she was paying two prices for meat and butter and three or four for fresh fruits and vegetables . Just as the soldiers were clamoring to be " demobbed , " so the businessmenwere clamoring to be freed from price controls . The big fellowssent their lobbyists to lay siege to the Seventy-ninth Congress  --  supposed to be Democratic , having been swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of it was made up of Southern reactionaries , and others were carried away by the tide . " Back to normalcy , " was the cry , and the confused new President accepted the solemn assurance of the businessmen around him that if he would let them have their way reconversion would be swift and a flood of civilian goods would soon be pouring out of the factories . One by one the controls were being lifted ; and so it came about that lumber and cement went into the building of night clubs and race tracks instead of homes for the veterans . You could get a **30;3936;TOOLONG built , provided that you were willing to pay fifty thousand for it , but you could n't get a five-thousand-dollar home built at any price ; such homes just ceased to exist , and when they came into sight again they were eight- and ten-thousand-dollar homes . So the young married couples crowded in with their parents , or they fixed up a shed , if they could find some scrap lumber , or they lived in a trailer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cooking on a gas burner . That was n't very happy , and moralists were shocked by the increase in the divorce rate . To the returned veteran the whole of America presented itself as a gigantic conspiracy to get his money away from him as quickly as possible ; and again there was no malice about it , just the normal operation of free enterprise . He could not turn on the radio without hearing a clamor of profit-seekers beseeching him to purchase gadgets on easy credit terms , or patent medicines and processed foods in " economy-size packages "  --  meaning big ones . The originators of fashions were in a conspiracy to make him uncomfortable in his perfectly good clothing ; he must throw it away and get a new outfit , because a vague " they " were wearing two-button coats instead of three-button coats , or vice versa . Despite the fact that cloth was scarce and millions in Europe freezing , women 's short skirts would suddenly become long . That would be called the " new look , " and women with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country were harder hit by the bad news of peace than Robbie Budd ; all his contracts were canceled and his countryneeded him no longer . There was going to be peace all over the world , protected by a United Nations , and nobody would ever again want those marvelous swift engines of destruction which Robbie had been pouring off his assembly line . As it happened , the president of Budd-Erling was an old man and had been through it once before ; so he had n't paid out all his profits as dividends but had salted them away as reserves , invested in the hated Roosevelt 's bonds . Now he could sell them , a few at a time , and pay his taxes and keep his head above waterBut that magnificent machine of production that he had built up just faded away , not exactly overnight but in a few weeks . The workers were turned off wholesale , with a very sincere " Thank you , " and a " Sorry . " If they had paid for their trailers they rolled away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen-year-old jalopies , or by train , back to Quebec or Maine or Arkansas or Texas . They had their savings , hiddenunder the car seat or made secure with a safety pin inside the women'sstockings . They would hunt jobs in peace industries , and whether they would find them was a subject about which the economic experts argued without ever coming to agreement . To what could you reconvert a huge plant for making fighter planes ? Next door was Budd Gunmakers , and they could turn to tack hammers and frying pans  --  they still had the old jigs and dies , carefully preserved . But what could Budd-Erling make ? A few cub planes for the civilian trade , a few luxury jobs for the rich  --  and what else ? Robbie had canvassedthe field with his experts . Gas heaters ? Refrigerators ? Radios ? Every field was covered by patents , and you would have to buy them or pay royalties ; you would have to learn a new business and install complete new equipment at enormous expense ; and just when you got started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . RobbieBudd suddenly decided that he wanted to sit back and rest . There were his two boys , now nearing their forties , vice-presidents of the company . They would want to go on , and Robbie would let them run the old portion of the plant , the part that predated the war . As for the rest , they would seal up the machinery in cellophane or coat it with grease and let it wait . If Robbie was right in his guess that World War III was only a few years away , all right , the boys could start things up again . Meantime Budd-Erling would live on its fat , like a bear in wintertime ; the stockholders would have to reconvert themselves or else learn to be bears . If they had n't saved part of the huge dividends Robbie had paid them they were fools and deserved what they would get . A tough decision , for the town as well as for Robbie and his investors . All the little merchants , the grocers who had sold food to the workers , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to fail or move away or both . The slum part of Newcastlewould become a ghost town , or at least an invalid town , half alive . A topsy-turvy world , in which war meant prosperity and peace meant stagnation ; in which slaughter and waste were good , and mercy , kindness , and love were intolerable . That was the way it was , and if you talked about changing it you were a dreamer , a crackpot . In this world of confusion and uncertainty people fought to get to the top , where money was plentiful and there were pleasure and luxury for all . If you were known to have money , or any form of distinction , you were besieged by persons on the make ; your mail was full of beggingletters , salesmen and agents knocked on your door , " climbers " tried to make your acquaintance , and poor relations came to stay with you . The quartet of reformers had put themselves in especially exposed positions : Lanny as a rich man 's son , Rick and Nina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all four of them as idealists and easy marks . Laurel came to her husband , looking worried , and said , " My sister Flo writes that she is coming to town , so I have the unpleasant task of telling you about her . " Lanny had heard very little about Laurel 's family . He had known well her Uncle Reverdy , a Baltimore capitalist , and his daughter Lizbeth , who had traveled to Hong Kong on a yacht which had been sunk trying to escape from the Japanese . Lanny knew that Laurel 's mother had died when Laurel was young , and that her father had died as an old man , not long before Lanny had met her . Laurel had said , " I never got along with my family , and there is no reason for you to be botheredwith them . " But now Sister Flo was coming and would force herself on Laurel , and Lanny too , if she got a chance  --  but he must n't let it happen . He listened to one of those ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laurel 's father had been a considerable landowner on theP359Eastern Shore of Maryland ; he had lived to what is called a ripe old age and had had three grown daughters . The youngest , Laurel herself , had come to New York and lived in a boarding-house , making herself into a writer . The middle one had visited her wealthy uncle in Baltimore , and there had made a " catch , " marrying a man of wealth and fashion who made her wretched by drinking and persistent infidelity . Flo was the eldest , and the least good looking , and she had stayed in the old family mansion with her father . At the age of seventy-plus this respectable church elder had horrifiedher by getting hurt in a motorcar accident , going to a hospital , being nursed by a designing young woman , and then bringing her home as his wife . Flo had flown into a fury and made it her task in life to punish that vile interloper . Even the fact that the new wife bore two children did n't help ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Flo could expect to get . She left her father 's home , and when he died soon afterward she took up the notion of proving that he had been mentally incompetent and that his will was invalid . " Of course she had no case , " said Laurel . " Reputable lawyers told her so ; but there are always shysters ready to prey upon a woman , and Flo has paid most of her inheritance over to them . If she is n't mentally deranged she is close to it , and spends all her time hating our stepmotherand trying to figure out ways of punishing her . Nothing can keep her from talking about her grievance , and she is always in debt and trying to borrow money . Now she has the idea that I have married a rich man , and she will want to try you , and to meet your family , and tell her troubles to them . I want you to be out when she calls , or stay in your room and read . " That was the sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich in America . Children were brought up to believe that the world owed them a luxurious living , without their making any sort of return . Servants waited upon them , all the world was at their beck and call ; they were taught to believe themselves superior to other people , all but a very select few . By the time they were grown they were hopelessly spoiled and doomed to unhappiness for the rest of their lives . Money was everything to them ; if they had plenty they used it to dominate the lives of others , and if they did n't have it they became parasites , little brothers or sisters of the rich . Lanny did n't meet Flo ; he went to the public library and did research , had lunch in an Automat  --  amusing product of a mechanical age  --  and then took a long walk in the park . He took the precaution to phone before he went home . There had been a scene of some sort ; Laurel was upset , but she did n't want to talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family skeletons locked up in her own closet . Lanny Budd , halfway through his forties , had become a seriousmindedgentleman , brooding over the sorrows and perils of the world . But there had to be some form of recreation , and Hansi and Bess would come to town and they would attend symphony concerts . There was a piano in the apartment , and the two artists would play  --  they were just as happy playing for two or three persons whom they loved as for a large audience . In the old days they had helped their cause by playing for political groups , but now Hansi would n't play for Communists and Bess would n't play for Socialists . They played for charity , especially for the refugees and displaced persons . Hansi chose sorrow-laden music by Ernest Bloch and other Jewish composers , and the listeners would sit with tears running down their cheeks . This married pair had reached a state of tension that was pitiful . There was hardly any subject they could talk about without trouble . Just as all roads had once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the class struggle . It was history , it was geography , it was current events , it was literature , it was even getting to be music . " We ca n't agree now about the shape of a phrase of Mozart , " said Hansi sadly ; and Lanny could n't joke about there being a party line for Mozart , for he knew that the Soviet authoritarians kept close watch over their composers and gave even the world-famous ones a dressing down now and then . The violinist said this only when his wife had gone off , presumably to meet some of her party comrades . She was getting more severe all the time , he reported , more doctrinaire and less devoted to the art of music . " The comrades think the world is theirs , " reported Hansi , " and they grow more and more avid . They do n't talk much in front of me , but I pick up a phrase now and then , and it bodes ill for us dreamers of peace . " The gentle idealist was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet he was coming to believe that they were necessary ; the world was going to belong to them , perhaps for a long , long time . Hansi was more in fear of violent revolution than even the former publisher of the Garland Fund books . He was beginning to fear thatP361the so-called democratic world had no weapons with which to meet the offensive of the grimly determined Reds . Said Lanny , " You mean you really think that Russia could beat the United States if it came to a showdown ? " " It wo n't come to a showdown , Lanny ; the Reds wo n't let it . They will use the much more deadly weapons of propaganda and intrigue . You know that they have got the Balkans ; and does anybody imagine they wo n't know how to root out the opposition and put those peoples under the dictatorship of the Politburo ? We invited them into China ; and that means they will have four hundred million hard-working people thoroughly indoctrinated . Britain is going to have to get out of India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propaganda will begin to show its effects there ? " " We democrats have some propagandists too , " suggested Lanny mildly . " Yes , but we go into the fight with one hand tied behind our backs . We believe with all our might in democracy in politics ; but what about democracy in industry ? Can you seriously believe that our Big Business masters are going to give up their privileges and their power for the sake of being able to counter the Reds , or for any other reason on earth ? " " Their power has been very much trimmed down of late . Have n't you heard their squeals ? " " I know , Lanny , but that 's all over now . Big Business is riding high . And what have we halfway democrats to offer the depressed peoples of the earth  --  the Chinese , the Hindus , the Indonesians ? We offer them free speech , but what they want is to get the landlords and the moneylendersoff their backs . " " You have been listening to Bess too long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who listened most patiently to Bess was Laurel . Somehow Lanny 's half-sister had got the idea that she might make a convert of Lanny 's wife ; perhaps it was because Laurel had a Southerner 's deeply ingrained politeness , and perhaps it was because she liked to hear all sorts of people and try to understand them . Someday she might want to put a Communist into a story . She even let Bess take her to meetings , at which she was introduced as " Miss Creston . " She sat and listened to the speakers and watched thep362audience , many of them foreigners or of foreign descent . What sufferinghad driven them to these extremes of bitterness , of fixed and implacable rage against the system which true-blue Americans glorified under the title of " free enterprise " ? Under that system a few had risen to the top and settled themselves and found the view pleasant . If you questioned the arrangement , individuals who had recently managed to shove their way up were pointed out . Was n't that fair ? Laurel would tell them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had complained of the voracity of the pike . The pike held a meeting to consider the grievance and admitted that the complaint was well based . A program was adopted agreeing that every year thereafter two carp should be permitted to become pike . It was remarks like that which caused Bess to decide that Laurel was " coming on " ; but the truth was Laurel would come on for a step or two and then retreat as many . She admitted the justice of the Communists ' indictment ; it was their methods which repelled her . Why could n't Stalin stick to the program he had talked about , of " Socialismin one country " ? Why not take American loans and machinery and develop that vast land , show the greater economy of the cooperativemethod , and convert the rest of the world by example ? CertainlyAmerican capitalism could do nothing to interfere with such a program , and the needed social changes could come about by peaceful means " Peaceful , hell ! " said Bess  --  from whose language you would never have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " American capitalism can talk about peace because it has the money , the natural resources , the know-how  --  everything in its greedy fists . All that Big Business wants is to have the game go on under its rules , and in a few years it will have the whole world in its debt as it now has America . That 's what peace ' means to capitalism  --  ownership and debt ; the masses become well-trained slaves , and the masters build an industrial empire with the fraudulent label of democracy . " " I do n't mean that the masses are to submit tamely to any such program , Bess . I mean that they can use the political power they have to win industrial power . " " It 's a pipe dream , Laurel . Capitalist power builds a civilization and then capitalist war destroys it . The people are sick and tired of being robbed by exploiters and cheated by slick politicians . " Lanny had on his dressing table a picture of his " little sister " as she had been as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had been a lovely pale blonde , with gentle features and a sweet smile , adoringP363when she fixed it upon Lanny . At the age of seventeen she had met the shepherd boy out of ancient Judea , as Lanny had called Hansi , in Emily Chattersworth 's drawing-room ; Hansi had played , and she had listened to the most entrancing sounds she had ever heard on earth . That had been twenty years ago , and Bess had made herself a competentpianist for her husband 's sake . Now she would tell you that she had become a Communist for humanity 's sake ; her face had become lean and her expression severe  --  do n't think she did n't suffer over the chasm that had opened in her marriage , do n't think she did n't know what tragedy she was preparing . She was , as Lanny had told Esther , a true granddaughter of the Puritans . Her forefathers had sailed in a tiny vessel across a turbulent sea and landed on a cold , inhospitable coast ; they had risked their lives for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give her happiness for the sake of this new religion which despised religion but which manifested all the symptoms and practiced all the zealotry of those who had received a revelation direct from God . Nothing made Bess madder than for anybody to tell her this ; Lanny kept teasing her with it , in the hope of taming her down just a little . " What are you going to do when your friends have taken control of America and are ready to shoot Hansi and me in the back of the neck ? Will you try to save us ? " " I am trying to save you right now , " replied Bess . " Make note of it and remember that I gave you warning . " Harry Hopkins , retired to civilian life , had got himself a house on Fifth Avenue , New York , and Mayor La Guardia had appointed him " impartial authority " for the garment trade , an arbitration job . Perhaps the friendly labor leaders understood what a sick man he was , for they settled all their disputes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intending to invite him to take part in a broadcast , but when he saw that wasted frame he turned it into a purely social call . Harry the Hop was losing the ability to assimilate food and was just fading away . But he could n't let go . There were two or three books he wanted to write ; he had a man sorting out his forty cases of records , and he would make efforts to study them and revive the past . Lanny 's presence rekindled the old fires . A dealer friend had loaned him some modern paintings for his room , and they talked about these : Utrillo , Picasso , Yves Tanguy , Serge Ferat , Marsden Hartley . Lanny entertained him with stories of the Monuments work , of Goring 's monstrous collection and of how the false Vermeer had taken him in  --  a forger getting the better of a bandit ! Old memories came to life , and Harry talked about his last visit to Stalin , a trip he had taken at the other Harry 's request , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harrys had done their best , but apparently the job had been too much for any number of men . Hopkins said , " I have my doubts whether Stalin himself could check the revolutionary drive of world Communism . He has raised up a genie . " When the visitor asked , " Do you think it is destined to conquer the world ? " the answer was , " I think it 's touch and go . It depends upon whether the blind greeds of capitalism can be chained . I believe that another depression would mean the end of our system . " There had just been a general election in France , and the middle group , including the Socialists , had won power . Harry thought that encouraging ; it showed the soundness of the democratic process . Lanny remarked , " The French will have to learn to pay taxes , " and the other replied , " If the Russians make us start rearming , the whole world will learn something new about taxes . " They talked about Churchill , incorrigible old Tory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His Majesty 's Loyal Opposition  --  a title that appealed to the sense of humor of an American but apparentlynot of a Britisher . Harry told of their combats over the issue of Normandy versus the Balkans , " Overlord " versus " the soft underbellyof Europe . " Throughout the war the issue was never quite settled , and Harry again and again would have to be flown to London . He described one of the scenes with a flash of his old humor . " Winston would throw the British Constitution at me ; but as it is n't written , no damage was done . " In between conferences the four Peace conspirators would thresh out what they had got and try to draw conclusions . They had accumulated a dossier on every suggested plan , and it seemed to be the opinon of the experts that all plans were impossible ; apparently this group of novices would have to choose some one impossible plan and blunder along with it . After many hours of discussion they found that each had settled upon a different method of getting rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small but distinguished in appearance . Being herself a fastidious person , she argued that few people would pay attention to reading matter that looked cheap and shoddy , no matter how excellent its content . She wanted to take time and get material of the very first quality , which people would treasure as literature ; so , even if the magazine ran for only a year or two , it would have a permanent effect on men 's minds . Rick , long-time Labour propagandist , had no more use for the carriagetrade in the field of literature than in that of the stage . He said that leisure-class standards were wholly corrupted by snobbery , and it was no use paying any attention to them , either in the appearance of a magazine or in its content . The highly esteemed writers of the time were sophisticated persons , motivated by delicate , well-camouflaged self-love . They wanted to show how much more they knew , how much more subtle and elegant they could be , than anybody else in their field . They wrote for small select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pessimism and futility . What Rick wanted was pamphlets for the masses , telling them exactly what they needed ; not many titles , but many copies of one title  --  like that by which the British Labour party had fought the election . Nina was clinging to her idea that all printed matter was out of date ; what counted was the radio . She was still collecting data about small stations and the possibility of building up a chain . " Work out an interestingprogram once a week , advertise it widely , and ask the people to help . If they like it they will tell their friends and it will spread . Even one of the big chains might take it in the end . " Lanny , thinking about a small cheap paper , had been down at the post office , making inquiries about postal rates , and had learned of a quirk in the regulations which he thought put books and pamphlets out of the running . On a single copy of a book , no matter how small , you had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classified as printed matter , you had to pay a minimum of a cent and a half on each separate piece . But on newspapers or magazines having " second-class entry " the postage was figured in bulk instead of on the individual parcel , and the rate in the first zone was only one and one-half cents a pound ; a small four-page newspaper might weigh less than an ounce , and the postage would be only a small fraction of a cent . What this regulation amounted to was a government subsidy to newspapers and magazines , on the theory that they were educational ; the subsidy amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars every year , and surely a foundation ought not to fail to take advantage of it .   What Lanny had in mind was a weekly newspaper , smaller than tabloid size . Its material would be packed , every sentence made to count , and , coming to the people once a week , its effect would be cumulative . Addressed by a stencil machine , such papers could go out at very low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " little old Appeal " a way to get circulation  --  by bundle orders . Persuade your readers to order the paper in hundred- or thousand-copy lots for distributionfrom door to door or at meetings . Make your paper so interestingthat people would read it , talk about it , and pass it around . Rick admitted that this provision in the postal laws put his pamphlet idea on the shelf . A weekly paper could be of use , no doubt about it ; there had been the London Clarion in Blatchford 's day , and now there were the Tribune and the Socialist Leader ; from time to time there had been many smaller papers , put out by the " ginger " groups . But how were you to get the subscribers to start with ? Lanny answered , " My idea would be to put the price of the paper below cost , because we 're not trying to make money but to spend it . Fifty cents a year for a weekly sheet is a price that no commercial concern could meet ; at that price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workingmen will go about in shops and union halls ; people will make lists of their friends and send us five or ten dollars . All the post-office people require you to have for a second-class entry is a list of paid subscriptions . We could get up a meeting at the Rand School and let Rick explain the plan to the audience ; we could hand out blanks and get such a list in one evening . " Nina said , " You 're forgetting my radio . For the same money you can hire time on a small station , have an interesting program , and tell the audience you are going to print such programs every week in a small paper and mail it to them for less than one cent a copy . Ask them to send you a dollar bill with two names , or a five dollar bill with ten names , and you may find yourself swamped . " So they came back to the radio : that marvelous discovery , not more than a quarter of a century old , whereby a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family " bus , " and sit quietly at home and listen to voices from the other side of the world . People hunted for worth-while programs , and sometimes they got one  --  sandwiched in between the praises of soap powders and cigarettes that their own manufacturers could n't have told from any other brand . If peopleP367heard an interesting discussion of some important topic and at the end a quiet persuasive voice invited them to subscribe to a paper along that line  --  well , it surely would n't cost much to try . Laurel said to Rick , " You can be the quiet persuasive voice . " He answered , " It must n't be a voice with a foreign accent . You be it , Lanny . " And when Lanny reminded them of the plan that he was to keep in the background , Rick said , " Be f 1r . Bienvenu . " It was the name Lanny had been using for camouflage with some of his friends in Europe , and he had told these three about it . Nina said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to be one that people know how to spell and that they can remember . Be Billy Budd . " They all laughed , and the name stuck ; thereafter when they talked about the radio idea the announcer bore that name . " Good evening , ladies and gentlemen , this is Billy Budd ! " It was the name of a book by Herman Melville , but the radio public would n't know that . It was their practice to invite somebody to dine with them and spend the evening : somebody who had been recommended as likely to have ideas . There came a dignified grandfatherly gentleman , tall , and holding himself erect in spite of his years . Ben Huebsch was the son of a rabbi , and for thirty years had been a pillar of the American Civil Liberties Union . He was editorial head of a publishing house and knew hundreds of persons who had to do with the writing game in the great metropolis . He gave it as his opinion that American periodicals were floundering about ; as he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak financial support , but mostly because there is no great editor . You ca n't make a great editor , you ca n't go into the market and buy one . But there are good men writing , and if the market for their work were enlarged the supply might increase . " Rick put in , " Do n't you think , Mr. Huebsch , that the reason there are no great editors is because there are no editors ? Policy is determined by publishers and owners , and the editors take orders . " " It may be , " admitted this man of authority , and went on to explain that the magazine of opinion was fighting a losing game . Under present business techniques only those periodicals which circulated by millions and had the support of the big advertisers could survive . " Writing for other magazines , you write for a small number of scholars and experts , and if you devote your capital to that , you can become effective only after the work of the scholars has seeped through a generation of studentswho have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that time we may not have any civilization to write for , " said Laurel . The publisher nodded assent . " In my youth , " he continued , " theNorth American Review , the Forum , the Arena , the Outlook , the Independent , McClure 's , the early American Magazine , Everybody 's and Collier 's under Norman Hapgood  --  all influenced the public . Everybody 's , also , as a muckraker , helped people to recognize corruption that called for remedy . But now all that is gone . Unless a magazine represents Big Business , and is conducted on the scale of the **30;3968;TOOLONG or the Reader 's Digest , it is out of the run-ning . " Mr. Huebsch went on to the book field , which he knew even better . An occasional good book met with success , but it was always a gamble , a matter of luck ; an equally worthy book , with identical promotion methods , might fail . The book-club world had the same ideas and ideals as the big magazines , and therefore was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see on every stand and stall do not pay dividends unless they are reprints of best-sellers . There are a few exceptions , and you might find one of the amiable gentlemen who run these concerns and would be willing to co-operate with you on some particular title ; but you will have to look elsewhere to spend your million . " " We have canvassed that field , " Lanny ventured ; " we seem to find red lights on every highway . " " I know of one road that may still be open to traffic , " said the publisher . They wondered , was he going to suggest prize essays or debates , scholarships , lecture courses  --  any of the things they had considered and rejected as too small in scale ? But it was n't those ; Mr. Huebsch wanted to tell them about newspaper syndicates , which were highly competitive and were free because it did n't take such a great amount of capital to start one . These syndicates sold material to newspapers , all kinds and sizes of papers , daily and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles , stories , interviews , popularizations of anything historical , biographical , medical , scientific . It could be in any form , even comic strips and cartoons ; the only requirements were , it had to be brief , well written or drawn , and not highbrow ; in a word , good newspaper stuff . Said this observant publisher , " If Paine had written Common Sensep369in the twentieth century it would n't have been a pamphlet but a newspaperarticle or series of them . If you want to get something over quick and big , you put it in a daily and get it read by millions before the ink is dry . All you need is the Tom Paines ; and if there are n't any you do the best you can with fellows who can write and who believe as you do . Set them to work on all the different kinds of stuff I have named , and then have it submitted to one or two thousand newspaper editors . " " But will the syndicates handle material of our sort ? " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalism . " The syndicates will handle anything the newspapers will buy ; and do n't forget that thirty per cent of our newspapers supported Rooseveltall the way through . Thirty per cent of American newspapers is an awful lot of both papers and money . They want variety , they want things that will hold the interest of their readers ; there is always a marketfor live stuff . I do n't mean that you can feed them straight propagandafor your cause or any other , but you can feed them stuff that is shaded that way . What you have to get is a staff of working journalists with a soul above shoe leather . You can find them in the offices of the most conservative papers in the country , men of scholarship and ideals who would welcome the emancipation which a job with you would constitute . " " Those are the most hopeful words we have heard yet , " exclaimed Laurel . " They are true . You can find writers among those who have names , and you can discover and develop others by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain college professors . If you take my advice , do n't mention your million dollars ; that might have a demoralizing effect . Just set out as a business concern with ideas . You ca n't expect to succeed with a rush ; material which a syndicatecan sell to hard-boiled editors does n't spring ready-made from the brow of Jove . You and your board of editors will have to plot out the big scheme , work it out in sections , interest your first squad of writers , and learn by trial and error . If you find the right syndicate you can get a lot of guidance from it ; they know what will go and what wo n't , and they will tell you because they want their share of the money . " " Tell us about the business side , " said Rick . " The syndicate will put a price on the articles , as high as they think they can get . They will keep a percentage , about forty , and you will get the rest ; you probably wo n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but if you meet expenses you can keep going indefinitely .   If after you have learned the business you think you can do better , you are free to start a syndicate of your own . All sorts of material would come to you , and you could sell it , even though it had nothing to do with your propaganda . You might find yourselves making money . If my scheme is good you will be feeding articles , stories , poems , essays , and cartoons to millions daily . It will be neatly camouflaged , but not dishonestly . There is nothing dishonest about Anna Karenina , or Ozymandias of Egypt , ' yet they are camouflaged moral tales from which publishers have made money . The same is true of Aesop 's fables and the parables of Jesus . " " This sounds quite wonderful , " said Nina . " We visitors find it hard to realize how big America is . " " The field is enormous , " replied the publisher , " and the old maxim applies , the room is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " said the fastidious Laurel . " Can we get good enough material ? " " Your standards must n't be too high , Miss Morrow . Good means good from the popular point of view : things that will touch the public'sheart or its conscience , or that will answer questions that are in the public 's mind . It has been my business to know writers for some forty years , and I can start you off with a dozen good men whose names mean something to newspaper readers and who sympathize with what you 're after . They would find it quite marvelous to write what they believe in  --  and get money for it . It means a risk , of course ; that would be the proper use for your capital , to carry the risk while you are experimenting and getting an education in the business . " All four of them agreed that this was the solution to their problem . They would set up a staff of editors and writers and feed material to the insatiable American press . Mr. Huebsch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a near-by suburb . In its earlier idealistic days the Cosmopolitan had been conducted from Irvington-on-Hudson , and Doubleday had built up an immense business at Garden City , Long Island . " The writers will come to you if you have a better mousetrap . " Nina hated to see her radio idea go glimmering , and Lanny the same for his little paper . Each told his idea briefly , and the publisher responded , " There is no reason why three such plans might not be dovetailed . Your writers may bring you material that is entirely too propa-P371gandistic for the syndicate to handle , and you could put that into a paper or make it into a radio program . Certainly it 's a good idea to have a radio program to promote a paper , and a paper to promote a program . If you begin on a small scale , both these experiments could help you , and either might grow of its own impulse . Why not have three departments and let each of you run the one he likes best ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had begun her career as an Army nurse in World War I. For almost thirty years she had run a household , raised a family , and been the severest critic of a playwrightand Labour journalist . She possessed an observant mind and had got her education on the run , as it were . Lanny , who had seen her during almost every year since her marriage , had acquired respect for her judgment and was pleased by this autumnal flowering . A woman 's reach must exceed her grasp ! Lanny did n't say much about his own plan in the presence of any visitor ; but he had his quiet intention . He called himself an oldfashionedperson , used to getting ideas from the printed word , and he knew from experience what papers could do to young and new minds . He was determined to have one , and Laurel had tactfully dropped her idea of a dignified and highbrow magazine ; after all , it was to Lanny that Emily had entrusted the funds and not to any of the others . If all Rick 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let Mr. I fuebsch suggest an editor to carry out Lanny 's plan under Lanny 's direction . So there they had their set-up ; they would be an organism with one body and three heads . Rick would run a writers ' bureau , feeding materialto a syndicate ; his wife would run a radio program ; Lanny and Laurel would run a small weekly paper , hoping to break through the barriers and achieve mass circulation . Three in one and one in three , holy , blessed Trinity ! Laurel , who had been brought up as a devout Episcopalian , said , " Do n't be sacrilegious . " To which the reverent Lanny replied , " By no means ! We may be calling for Divine assistance before we get through . "   THE sun of peace had risen and was shining upon a new America . Everybody had been rationed and restricted , everybody had been makingsacrifices , or at any rate telling others to make them  --  and now all that was over . Everybody was free and could do what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say " Fill ' er up "  --  providedonly that he had the price , and practically all had it . There had never been so much money in circulation since the beginning of the world  --  real money , dollars ! Everybody wanted to buy everything he had been doing without ; everybody wanted to make more money to buy more things ; everybody wanted to go to Florida for the winter , or perhaps load up the old jalopy and move to Southern California for good . And of course everybody who was abroad wanted to get back to God 's country ; nobody wanted to stay and teach democracy to Germansor Japanese . The humiliating truth was that many Americans had but an imperfect idea of democracy ; many were Republicans and thought of democracy as the opposition party ; it meant Roosevelt , whom they had been fighting and would go on fighting long after he was no more . Army officers , and Navy officers even more so , believe in giving orders and having them obeyed . How to reconcile American Military Government with notions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sounded to political orators at home . Captain Jerry Pendleton wrote his friend Lanny about this . Jerry himself was well content , he reported ; they had sent him to Mondorfles-Bains , near Luxembourg , to help watch over the higher-ups among the war criminals  --  this on account of his knowledge of French and German and of European ways in general . The Army had taken over Jerry 's boarding-house in Cannes , and his wife had come to join him . They had a comfortable apartment , and Jerry had a car  --  what more could an American want ? P373In course of the years Jerry had become slightly infected with his ex-pupil 's notions  --  more than he would have admitted , and perhaps more than he realized . He was n't so well pleased with the way things were going in the captured lands ; the denazification program just was n't working out . The big bugs were going to get it in the neck all right , but their underlings were getting by with excuses and evasions , and many of them were back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem , for it was hard to find anybody who would admit that he had really been a Nazi , and it was hard to find anybody with any experience in administration or management who had n't really been a Nazi . The Army could n't manage Germany without the help of Germans , and the tendency was to say " Oh , to hell with it ! " and turn the job over to anybody who could and would do it properly . Said Jerry : " The people we ought to be working with are your kind  --  the Social Democrats . But the average Army officer is accustomed to thinking of any kind of Socialist as a nut . He looks down upon such fellows at home and ca n't understand why he should bother with them abroad . The people he looks up to at home are the Big Business crowd , the executives , those who have good manners and the right sort of homes to invite him to . The same sort of people are here , and he ca n't understand that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring them back tomorrow if they could . " Interesting to Lanny was his ex-tutor 's account of the way the Nazi big shots were living . Their home was the former Palace Hotel , seven stories high and once a resort of fashion , but no more . Its windows were all barred and the glass had been replaced with unbreakable material . The elegant furniture had been taken away . " This is a jail , " . said Jerry . " We have rules , and they are obeyed . Our fellows call it the Big House , ' and the Germans have learned that much of the American language . They do not have newspapers and not one of them has sent or received a letter since he came . Ashcan ' is our code name . " Here fifty-two of the top Nazi officials and military officers were being held until their fate should be decided by the War Crimes Commission . Here were Reichsmarschall Goring , Foreign Minister von RibI ) entrop , Grand Admiral Doenitz , Field Marshal von Kesselring , Field llarshal von @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on down the line . Few of them whom the son of Budd-Erling had not met at one time or another through two decades , and now he read with interestthe account of their behavior . Goring , that huge bulk of vanity , half emperor and half clown , had Imagined that he was going to be taken in state to call upon General Eisenhower ; now he was living in a room furnished with a cot , a straw mattress , a chair , a toothbrush , and an aluminum drinking cup . He was having hospital care to break him of his drug habit ; he had been taking twenty times the normal dose of paracodeine , and now he cone plained bitterly that the Americans were cheating him . When he had sat down in his chair it had broken down , and they had got him a bigger one . Today he was in the dumps and tomorrow he would be haughty , appealing to posterity in his thoughts . Ribbentrop , that egregious wine salesman who had displayed his insolentmanners in so many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumberman 's shirt without a tie and his gray hair was shaggy . He was careless about making his own bed and had to be reprimanded frequently . He was greatly concerned about his fate and had fired volleys of questions at Jerry : when would the trials start , where would they be held , what would the charges be and who was preparing them ? Jerry had answered nothing , because that was orders . The prisoners were permitted to see movies , but only of one kind , those taken of scenes in the concentration camps . Doenitz had viewed some of them and had written a letter , blaming Allied air raids for the emaciated condition of the inmates . The American commander had replied that no doubt the Allied air raids were also responsiblefor the fat and sleek condition of the SS guards who had watchedover the concentration-camp inmates . Another curious detail was the class feeling which manifested itself among the prisoners . The ranking officers played cards with one another , but never with the low-caste civilians . Everybody disliked Ribbentrop and ignored him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought to the place , Admiral von Doenitz had refused to eat at the table with him . He had been given the choice of eating there or not eating at all . Streicher was cut by everyone , as was Dr. Robert Ley , Nazi Ministerof Labor . That drunken beast was the one who had grabbed Johannes Robin , just after the Nazis took power , intending to plunder him of his fortune ; but Goring had heard about it and taken the wealthy Jew for himself . Jerry knew about this and understood that Lanny would be interested in hearing how the beast was living now . Ley and Streicher were inseparable ; the GIs called them the " Gold Dust twins . " Ley had got a pair of GI trousers , Class X , meaning that they had been discarded by the Army ; they were freshly pressed ,  |p375whereas  Streicher 's were knee-sprung . Streicher had made a fuss , but Jerry had told him to be glad he had any trousers at all . This punishment was part of the job of making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lanny 's satisfaction . No one knew better than he how evil these men had been , and how little right they had to put the cloak of legality over their deeds . Let the precedent be established that the beginning of aggressive war was a crime against mankind and that it would be punished by world authority . Law had to have a beginning , and there was no better time than the present . The United Nations delegates were about to assemble in New York and set up a world legislature and a court to adjudicate disputes and make fighting forever unnecessary . The United States was assuming the leadership and paying a good part of the bills . What kind of examplewas America going to set , and what were the world delegates going to find when they came here ? These were questions the four Peace conspirators kept asking themselves . In the days when Lanny had been playing the role of Mister Irma Barnes , he had gone about with the smart set on Long Island and in the New York night clubs ; he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred of them casually . Now they were middle-aged like himself ; many had been in the Armed Services and were coming back ; others had had civilian jobs  --  it was n't good form for anybody to be idle in a crisis such as the country had been passing through . He ran into them in hotel lobbies and on the street ; they recognizedand greeted him . Where had he been keeping himself all this time ? They invited him to their cocktail parties , and sometimes he went , for he had to know America , high and low , and what people were saying and thinking and planning to do with the new world of peace . One thing that Americans were doing , and that nobody could miss , was drinking liquor . It was alarming to see them pouring it down , and a mystery how they got away with it . No wonder you read of automobile accidents and that some of your acquaintances were taken to the hospital or the morgue . Women sat in bars with the men , or they sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places called " night spots " were springing up on the outskirts of every town . In New York there was one opening up on New Year 's Eve whose cover charge was seventy-five dollars per person . Food and drink were in addition . Millions of women had been left alone for one year , two years , three . They suspected that their men , in Britain , France , North Africa , or on lonely Pacific islands , had n't been living lives of plaster saints ; the women had been experimenting also , and now the divorce rate was mounting fast  --  one marriage in three went on the rocks . In New York State , where the Catholic Church had succeeded in limiting the grounds of divorce to adultery only , there had been worked out a friendly arrangement of professional co-respondents ; for the sum of ten dollars a nice respectable lady would consent to be discovered in a hotel room with you and be named as your partner in adultery . You would conductyourself as a gentleman and not assume that any impropriety was expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children also had been running wild . In California were " zoot-suiters , " who wore strange-looking clothing and fought in gangs with rocks and knives  --  not seldom they fought the police . They smoked what they called " reefers , " meaning marihuana . There were " bobby-soxers , " who gathered in radio studios to hear their favorite crooners and screamed lilac maniacs . They mobbed the movie stars for autographs and tore the buttons off the men 's clothes for souvenirs . Those who were not quite old enough for such exploits sat at home studying their lessons , but could n't do them unless the radio was running ; they read with their eyes and listened with their ears . If you mentioned John Milton they looked blank , but they knew the names of scores of hot trumpeters . This new generation had invented a fantastic language all their own and kept improving on it . At the moment all phrases had to rhyme , and so a youth would remark that his dream beam was a chill bill , meaning that she did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or he would call her a dull skull and say that she was n't alive to the jive . If she got tired of him she would tell him to drop dead , or perhaps just to get lost . You had to know all the subtleties of this new jargon , for if she said " Leave us get lost , " it meant that she wanted to take him out into the woods or upstairs to a bedroom . Yes , there were things that needed to he changed in America ; and the people who did n't know it would n't thank you for calling their attention to it ; they would call you a drip or a droop or a jerk , or , worse yet , an unhep . They would put the rope up on you , a phrase which might puzzle you unless you knew the snooty night spots where they had a velvet rope across the entrance to the tables and youP377could n't get by unless the headwaiter knew you and was sure that you were prepared to spend several hundred dollars during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hell in a hurry , and would n't stop to think about the consequences to themselves , to say nothing of the rest of the world . " Nobody bothers about me , " Sister Flo had said . " Why the hell should I bother about them ? " The four crusaders set their course grimly and reconciled themselves to being unpopular . Perhaps in course of time they would discover some new friends and allies  --  there must surely be some old-fashioned people in this hard-pressed world . So far in human history there had been at least a score of great civilizations which had been built with hard toil and had gone down in ruins because of luxury and corruptionat the top and misery and revolt at the bottom . Always there had been prophets crying doom and being stoned . What was new in this case was that the prophets had a million dollars , and that might make a difference in the outcome . There was no way to find out but to try . Preparing to become a radio expert , Nina spent her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was , she said , exactly like the little girl who had a little curl ; when it was good it was very very good , and when it was bad it was horrid . Mostly it was bad ; but from it you could chart the American mind , and you had to know what anything was before you set out to change it . Radio was supported by the advertisers , and the advertisers spent millions studying the public , seeking ways to shift it from one brand of cigarettes to another brand , as like each other as two peas . The words that the public loved , the ideas the public accepted , were in those commercials . A generation of American children was being brought up on them . There was a story of a little girl of five who was taken to church for the first time by her father . When it was over he asked what she thought of it , and the answer was , " The music was very good , but I thought the commercial was too long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their windowsand do calisthenics with imaginary company . Then they wanted to hear the news , and plenty of hot jazz while they ate their bacon and eggs and swallowed their coffee . After that the men went off , and the women of America owned the radio . They had loud music while they swept and dusted , and they had menus for the day 's dinner , and fashion notes to guide their shopping or sewing or trimming of hats . P378They listened to gossip about their favorite movie stars and praise of the pictures they might choose to see in the evening . And always commercials , a double dose every fifteen minutes . Music had its charms , and so they sang them ; and before you shut one off , stop and recall the days when you were bounced on your grandmother'sknee and listened to Mother Goose rhymes . They had delightedboth grandmother and child , and now it was the same thing for the same stages of mentality  --  first childhood and second . In those days it had been the cat and the fiddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Duz soap powder and somebody 's face lotion . Lanny had once asked a great lady of society why she persisted in taking a dangerous kind of " alkalizing " drink , and the answer came without a trace of a smile , " The man who tells about it has such a pleasant voice . " After her pick-up lunch it appeared that the American housewife liked to settle down for a good cry . For a matter of three hours she was fed soap operas , serial stories of the unending perils and romantic entanglements of heroines exactly like herself . As fast as the heroine got out of one trouble she was in another ; she was unjustly suspected , her marriage was breaking up , her children were about to be taken away from her . Did Charlie love her or did he love the other girl ? It went on and on ; the listeners knew these different families and the characters involved and could hardly wait for the next day to learn what was going to happen to their favorites . Zoltan Kertersi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child and had lived in a tenement , said that in those days there were papers issued weekly with much the same sort of stories ; they were pushed under the grilled doors of areaways , intended for servant girls , and were free because the revenue came from advertisements of patent medicines and abortion mixtures and other things that servant girls were supposed to need . Toward evening the men came home , and there was news , and horrordramas to frighten the children before they went to bed . Then came the comedies , with laugh meters to test the reaction of the audiencein the studios to each and every joke , old or new . Also there were programs in which members of the audience competed for prizes . " Take it or leave it , " the master of ceremonies would say , and the audience would shout the warning , " You 'll be sorry ! " This programgave the American language a new phrase , " the **29;4000;TOOLONG . " Nobody could foresee the horrid developments which were about to come out of the many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody could foresee the consequence of any action to which the big-money motive was driving this greedy world ? With Mr. Huebsch 's advice , Nina found a radio announcer who would come in his off time and teach her the ins and outs of this business . She wanted to know it all , even though she herself would never be an announcer , on account of her English accent . It was a fact that puzzled and hurt her but that she had to face , that the English were n't as popular in New York as they deserved to be . English lecturers were n't wanted , nor English advice . Perhaps it was the influence of the Irish , and of the Germans in past years ; or perhaps it was what the children had read in their schoolbooks . The redcoats had burned Washington , and lecturers had come over and collected dollars and then gone back and written impolite books about the domestic manners of the Americans . England was a land of kings and queens and dukes , pronounced " dooks " ; the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , and when it did the former Anglomaniacswould n't like it . Sir Eric Pomeroy-Nielson spent his time inviting editors and authors to lunch or dine with him  --  those men and women whose names had been supplied by the heaven-sent publisher . The Englishman would tell them about the plan , and if they were interested they would sit and chat for an hour or two after the meal . Rick wanted first of all a tiptop man as assistant , one who knew not merely New York but America . It had to be one who had been trained in the newspaper game and yet who was capable of independent judgment ; a man who believed in world order and co-operation and would have his heart in the job of promoting them . Rick also wanted writers , many of them , and they had to believe what they were putting on paper . If they were successful writers they would have to take less money in return for freedom of expression . They would have to have conscience enough to give their best work to the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put away in a bureau drawer . Rick had done many kinds of writing , and had been around in a big city , and was n't an easy man to fool . Word got about town that a titled Britisher had a wallet stuffed with money and a new scheme up his sleeve . Reporters and executives outP380of jobs came to see him , and he listened to what they had to say and made notes ; poets and storywriters sent him manuscripts , and he prom ised to read them and did . Already the mill was beginning to grind . A secretary was busy , files were accumulating , and pretty soon there would have to be an office somewhere . That was Lanny 's job . He went scouting in the car , to one town after another , interviewing real-estate agents . Nothing acceptable could be rented ; he would have to buy , and that was a serious matter : an office with room enough for four busy managers and their staffs , secretaries , files , and what not ; also a home for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each of the four would have to have a workroom , and there would have to be at least a couple of servants to keep the place in order . Quite an outlay , and a million dollars did n't look so big as it had sounded . Also there had to be a printer in the neighborhood ; someone who could make letterheads and circulars and such things for an office , and could start with a small paper and be willing to expand . For Lanny that meant learning the printing business and getting bids ; it meant putting Sam de Witt at work locating a fast press that could be purchasedif need developed . If you meant to succeed you had to be ready to hoist anchor and set sail while the breeze was fair . If you were stuck in the mud you might stay forever , mourning your lost opportunity . While Lanny and Freddi Robin had bummed around in Munich , Lanny had told about the bequest , and Freddi had gone off like a chain reaction . He would give his services for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , janitor , chauffeur , anything that would enable him to be within earshot of this wonderful enterprise , to learn about it and show what he could do . Since then he had written not merely to Lanny but to his Uncle Hansi to plead his cause . He was wild to get out of the Army now that the job was done ; he begged his grandfatherto pull wires , and to ask the president of Budd-Erling to do the same . This youngster had a keen mind and could get his education by reading copy and listening to his elders just as well as by sitting in a crowded college classroom . And now at this crisis came a wonderful event : Freddi came home ! He came with his uniform newly pressed and himself well and fairly bursting with eagerness . How his discharge had been managed he had no idea ; his grandfather , the ex-Schieber , the onetime multimillionaire , P381would n't tell . Johannes just smiled and said there were wires that could be pulled if you knew where to look for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work and keep him out of mischief . Freddi did n't know a thing in the world about the printing business or the real-estate business ; but it was with him as it had been with Jerry Pendleton when he had come to be Lanny Budd 's tutor a full generation ago . Beauty had asked what he could teach and he had answered , " Anything , if you give me two weeks ' start . " He was keen and amazingly well informed for his age . He would run errands and bring back the right answers ; he would get people on the telephone and make notes of what they said ; he would hop in and out of the car , he would type letters with two fingers , and all the while he would keep you cheerful with his faith and hope  --  he was the new generanon . Lanny would have trained him for a business manager , only it was obvious that he was the intellectual type . Also there was Laurel . She was going to be writing for all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a walk in the park  --  that was where and how her mind worked . Stories , poems , essays , news material  --  Mr. Huebsch had specified all these , and Laurel 's imaginationwould race from one form to another and weigh and test the ideas that came to her . She would come home and make careful notes before anything else had driven them out of her mind . For years she had been writing novels and stories exposing and ridiculing the Nazis , and she could feel that she had had something to do with putting them in the hotel-jail at Mondorf-les-Bains . Now she would use her talents against the profiteers , those who turned not merely industry but also government to the service of wholesale greed . She would write against these with all the energy she possessed , knowing in advance that the critics would say she was wasting her talents upon propaganda . There was a war between ethics and esthetics , and it had been going on for a long time . One side would say that you could n't have civilized life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say , what was the good of having any sort of life if you did n't have beauty ? Lanny found what he thought would serve them in the small town of Edgemere , in Jersey . You took the train at the Pennsylvania Station and it carried you under the Hudson River . In a little more than half an hour you got off , and a car would meet you and take you about three miles ; or you could motor the whole way , via the Holland Tunnel and the Pulaski Skyway . Lanny showed his colleagues the layout . On the edge of the town had been a fine old mansion ; the family had decayed and so had the mansion , becoming a rooming-house for workers in a war plant not far away . The plant had shut down suddenly and most of the occupants had gone . The place could be bought for twenty-four thousand dollars , which was high , but then everything was high . It was depressing at first glance , as he had warned them ; it was dirty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device , a DDT-bomb ; you set one of them in the middle of the floor and turned a little knob , and it began to shoot a fine spray ; you left it there , and a fog spread through the house . With three or four such bombs in different parts you would never have to think about vermin again . Then you would have everything scrubbed and cleaned , and the rooms redecorated if you could find workers to do it . There was a furnace in the cellar , and a man would come night and morning to tend it . There were rooms enough ; a suite with bath on the ground floor for Rick and Nina , a second story with two bathrooms in it , and a wing with a room where the youngster could play without disturbing anyone else . They could make it do . The big factory in the town had been making incendiary bombs  --  the small boy who pointed out the place to Lanny called them " incineratorbombs . " Now it was shut down , and so was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the bombs . This latter was a one-story stucco building about a hundred and fifty feet long and thirty wide . There was a front office , and all the rest was one long room . Work had stopped one day , and they had n't even bothered to sweep out the scraps of metal ; you could imagine that news had come of the ending of the war and everybody had rushed outside and never come back . Through the center of the main room ran a long table with a moving top , a " belt , " it was called , and women workers had sat on stools ; the table could be taken apart and the lumber used to build partitions ; they could make as many small rooms as they needed , and put in small gas heaters with vents in the roof or the outside walls . The company was asking twenty thousand for the place , and Lanny proposed to offer ten and expected to pay from twelve to fifteen . There was a printing plant in the town , and the owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become a ghost town . He would do their work cheaply , just to keep going ; or he would sell them the plant and run it for them . He was sure that a panic and a big bust were coming , and he was indiscreet enough top383reveal his fears . It was astonishing how many people , big and little , had that conviction ; they lived with a sword of Damocles hanging over their heads . The respectable newspapers and magazines rebuked this state of mind severely , but the pessimists took it for granted that this was propaganda . The two places would do , the friends decided  --  ethics winning out over esthetics , at least for a time . The essentials were here in both places : water , electricity , gas , telephones . There was a post office and mail delivery ; telegrams would be delivered by phone , and there were a couple of cafes in the town , not elegant but clean . Their guests could come on the train and be met at the station , or they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work here and have their chance at success . There was labor in the town , and so long as they had money to spend they would be welcomed with open arms . Lanny made his offers and his deals ; they were put into escrow at the local bank , and that was as good as ownership . Freddi Robin was all over the town , digging up people to do the various jobs ; some who had been on the point of moving back to New York were happy to learn that the town was n't going to die after all . The girls who had made bomb fuses would now learn to make stencils and mail papers . The legman for the town 's newspaper came running ; what was it all about ? They told him they were going to set up a literary bureau and publish a small paper , but not a newspaper , so he did n't have to worry . He wanted the story , of course , and an agreeable gentleman named Billy Budd gave it to him ; there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baronet and his lady  --  oh , my goodness ! You could see the reporter 's eyes pop and you could be sure that the town would take fire . They had been mourning the demise of an incinerator-bomb plant and a fuse factory , and here they were going to be made famous . Actually , there was to be a radio studio right in the fuse building , and Edgemere , N. J. , would be put on the map ! It was flat country , bleak and desolate in winter , with snow everywhere , and nothing green but a few straggly pines . But that would n't worry them , they knew that spring would come , and a gardener would plant flowers at both places . " The Willows " was the name of the mansion , and the big trees would make shade when it was needed . Freddi moved in and saw that the furnace was kept going  --  otherwise the water pipes might have burst . Some of the lodgers had n't moved out yet , but a few ten-dollar bills brought action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the office building . The decorators started work , and in the office the carpenters began hammering ; lumber was almost unobtainable , but by good fortune they found some plasterboard for partitions . The tinsmiths came , but they did n't have any pipe , and you could n't get any gas heaters , unless it was in junkshops , so Freddi drove to Newark and looked up such places . So many things to think of and to oversee , and so many shortages  --  youmight have to drive miles to get a few pounds of nails . Freddi 's mother heard about what was going on . Lanny had met her for the first time when he had been a guest on Johannes Robin 's yacht , cruising in the Mediterranean . Rahel had then been a gentle and conscientious girl , with a sweet contralto voice ; her husband had played the clarinet , and as Hansi and Bess had been along it had been a musical voyage . The future had been mercifully hidden from them , and they had had no idea of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband and shut him up in Dachau , Lanny had been the one who possessed the magic to get him out , and for that he would be forever a hero in Rahel 's eyes . Now she had a new husband and a new family , but she could leave them for a few days in care of Mama  --  that was the grandmother , Johannes 's wife . They wanted furniture for both the home and the office , and the prices the stores were asking were simply scandalous . Rahel , now a plump , middle-aged woman , had her own car , and she took over the job . She put up in a near-by hotel , and she hunted up all the secondhandshops in Newark and near-by towns ; she argued and scolded , and went from one to the next , and by the time the painters had got out of The Willows and the carpenters had got out of the fuse plant she had accumulated two vanloads of new and used furniture at about half what Lanny or Laurel would have had to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having the well-chosen stuff unloaded and put in place . She interviewed cooks and housemaids and got one of each , and saw to the arrangements for electricity and telephoneand water and gas and coal and garbage and trash disposal  --  so many things does it take to keep alive in a civilized world ! Those literary folk in New York could go on working on their plans to save the world , and meantime Rahel and her son would see that they had a home to move into , one that was warm and clean , and had groceries in the pantry , and sheets and blankets on the beds , and coffee or orange juice ready for them when they woke up in the morning.  |p385What  was more , Rahel would come once a week , she promised , and see that the servants were not neglecting them and the tradespeoplenot cheating them , and that all their bills were properly checked before they were paid . The world was full of people who were ready to take advantage of any weakness they found ; they would assume that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks . Let Rahel be the one to deal with them , and they would find out the dif-ference ! Both Laurel and Nina thought this a gift from heaven . Laurel liked housekeeping as little as anything in this world , and Nina , who had had to do it for many years , now wanted to put her mind on a radio studio . By all means let Rahel feed them and warm them , and be forever blessed ; when it was necessary to have a party or a reception , let her be caterer and hostess . No cocktail parties , they were at one about that ; they would have coffee and fruit punch , and those who did n't like it could wear their hip-pocket flasks and retire to the lavatory for a nip . Nina had made the discovery that they did n't have to go in to the radio station in the crowded city . They could install a microphone at very small expense in one of the rooms in their office ; at the appointedhour the telephone company would give them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That way they could avoid travel and have everything in one place . A stenographer could take flown an ad lib program and type it off for the paper . They would give Edgemere as their address for fan mail and orders , and the post office in the town gave them an imaginary number  --  Box 1000 , Edgemere , New Jersey . The slowest mind could remember that . Mr. Huebsch had recommended Station WYZ as one that was likely to be interested in their project . This station went in for what is called " class , " or " side , " or " swank , " or " tone "  --  there were many fancy words for it ; the rich catering to the rich , trying to make themselvesfeel important . The publisher said , " The rich are bored and are looking for something new . Be very elegant and impressive . " Nina and Laurel had an argument as to which of them could make a better deal for the radio time . Laurel insisted that a genuine baroness was a far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands in the city . Nina , on the other hand , argued that this was a professional and not a social matter , and that a foreign
