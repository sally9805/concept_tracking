The railway car , resting on a siding under the shadow of a Balkan mountain on whose crest anti-aircraft units kept constant vigil , was set as usual for Adolf Hitler 's morning conference with his advisers . Assembled in the car were all the biggest of the bigs : Goring , Goebbels , Ribbentrop , Keitel , Brauchitsch , Raeder , Himmler , Hess ( see cut ) . They were gathered together to congratulate Adolf Hitler on his 52nd birthday . <P> The celebration , said the official news agency D.N.B. , was one of " soldierly simplicity , " including a brass band , a review of honor troops , toasts in champagne , a wooden platform for speechmaking , an international broadcast , armfuls of flowers , and certain other super-soldierly amenities . Each of the Nazi bosses drank a tasteful toast to the birthday man . Keitel : " Big and gigantic successes . . . . " Goring : " You , my Fhrer . . . . " Hess : " God protect our Fhrer . " <P> Just what deity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fhrer , referred to was not specified . It could scarcely have been the God of the Orthodox Eastern Church , which was next day to celebrate its Easter , symbolic of rebirth , expressing faith in life , not an occasion of death. * It was probably not one of the deities once thought to be resident on Mt . Olympus , on whose summit German troops had planted the swastika just a few hours earlier-for the Gods of Olympus were fundamental to the ancient civilization which had invented democracy , the very thing Adolf Hitler had set out on his wars to extirpate . <P> Adolf Hitler , with soldierly simplicity , accepted the good wishes of his good friends , stared for a moment at the maps of slaughter spread out on the car 's table , asked for the latest military reports , and retired to peruse them . They were almost universally favorable to his cause . <P> The Yugoslavs were out of the war . They had capitulated after just twelve days of resistance . The Axis deathblows had been delivered by German forces which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Italians who poured down the Adriatic Coast . <P> In Greece the Allied lines had been repeatedly pushed back . The Germans believed the heaviest battles of the campaign were over . At some points Adolf Hitler 's infantry troops had attacked in oldfashioned , 1918-style , suicidal mass , but at a price . According to Greek accounts " Adolf Hitler 's Own " SS ( Elite Guard ) , magnificent hand-picked lads of 19 and 20 , bore the brunt of the slaughter .
