Unlike its sister churches in the Anglican Communion , the Protestant Episcopal Church of the U. S. has never had an archbishop . But last week it took a step to get itself within three years the next thing to an archbishop . Hitherto U. S. Episcopalians have merely chosen a Presiding Bishop , expected him simultaneously to run his own diocese and head the church at large . The present Presiding Bishop , the Right Rev. Henry St. George Tucker of Virginia , has a nationwide job but ecclesiastical authority only in Virginia . Most often he is in Manhattan , where he must get leave from Bishop William Thomas Manning to officiate in the chapel of the Church Missions House . <P> Last week the Episcopalians ' 53rd triennial General Convention , at Kansas City , did not quite get around to creating an archbishopric but it voted to make the National Cathedral at Washington the official seat of the Presiding Bishop , thus giving him a national pulpit for his pronouncements . Eventually the change may mean that the diocese of Washington will become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for England . <P> Not likely to be the first U. S. Episcopal archbishop is lean , spiritual Bishop Tucker , who as a good Virginia Low Churchman would dislike the trappings of the office . He will reach the retirement age for Presiding Bishops ( 68 ) at the next General Convention in 1943 , when by a pleasant coincidence Bishop James Edward Freeman of Washington will reach the newly set retirement age for other bishops ( 72 ) . With the two offices falling vacant at once , Episcopalians will then have a good excuse for merging them . <P> Precedent-breaking was many another move by the General Convention in its second and final week 's sessions in Kansas City 's bright new Municipal Auditorium . In crowded sessions it : <P> Made Episcopalians ' professions of interfaith unity effective by voting to take full membership in the Federal Council of Churches and the World Council of Churches . <P> Postponed the concordat proposed in 1937 to unite the Episcopalian and Presbyterian Churches . Nevertheless , for the first time at a General Convention , the Episcopalians held a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moderator , Dr. William Lindsay Young ( a fraternal delegate at the convention ) : " My earnest prayer tonight is that I may live to stand before you some time and address , not your church , not my church , but our church . " <P> Postponed to 1943 final consideration of a liberalized marriage &; divorce canon ( TIME , Sept. 16 ) . <P> For the first time in history voted financial assistance to the mother Church of England . Sent by the Archbishop of Canterbury , the Right Rev. Noel Baring Hudson asked aid for Britain 's war-crippled missions , called World War II " a hell-sent opportunity for more effective Christian work in all nations . " A well-chosen emissary was slight , vigorous Bishop Hudson , secretary of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel , which nurtured Anglicanism in this country all through the colonial period . In part payment for that spiritual debt , General Convention promptly upped an appropriation for help to British missions from a tentative $117,500 to $300,000.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
