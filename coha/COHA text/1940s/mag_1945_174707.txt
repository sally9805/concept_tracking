Carried to about 15,000 feet by the mother plane , the baka would be cast loose by its pilot to ride on the 40-second " whoosh " from three powerful rockets .

But more were expected to appear ; as long as the supply of Japanese fanatics and plane manufacturers held out , the baka would be a menace .
