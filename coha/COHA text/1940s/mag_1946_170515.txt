THE FAIR FIELD ( 240 pp. ) - John Moore-Simon &; Schusfer ( $2.75 ) . <P> In 1944 , British Navy flyer John Moore lay in a Normandy field and watched ancient buildings in the town of Caen go up in flames . Near by , a Norman farmer , cursing quietly and steadily , was extracting a bomb splinter from a cow 's hindquarters . But for the accident of the English Channel , Moore reflected , this scene might have been laid in his own birthplace-the once-Norman market town of Elmbury , near Stratford on Avon . <P> The Fair Field is John Moore 's way of putting Elmbury on the map before tomorrow 's enemy bombs or friendly " improvements " have wiped it off forever . Frankly nostalgic and romantic , The Fair Field is also gay , bucolic , and crammed with anecdotal vitality . It is a record of Moore 's years in Elmbury ( a fictitious name ) from the year of his birth ( 1907 ) to World War II , but it is also a portrait of country life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Author Moore left school , he joined the old family firm of auctioneers . " My uncle . . . believed that if a man bought Lot 224 Bedroom Utensil and sundries for two shillings the fact should be recorded for two years " - so no one threw out the vast accumulation of records that had been gathering dust since 1750 . Open the books , read between the lines of " the clerks ' cold copper-plate , " and one might find " a microcosm of English life and history , " a story of the effects of generations of alternating prosperity and depression upon men who worked the land at Poppie 's Parlor , Salley Furlong , Coneygree , Hungry Harbor , Merry-come Sorrow . <P> Rosy-Fingered Sales Talk . Auctioneers , says Moore , have conventions " as strict as that which bound great Homer himself . The Residence must be Desirable ; just as the dawn was always rosy-fingered . " But they see man at his best and worst , at his poorest and richest . <P> In Elmbury , the beautiful and hideous flourished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norman abbey lay " hundreds of acres of the worst slums in England . . . tottering hunchbacked cottages , " their beds crawling with vermin , their wardens ablaze with roses . Down twisting High Street once a year , wearing robes and cocked hats , paraded the newly elected Town Council-popularly known as the Town Scoundrels . On market days " the real wealth of England " poured through like a flood-white-faced Herefords , red Shorthorns , sows whose huge bellies brushed the ground , flocks of sheep so bulky and close-packed that the yelping sheep dogs could scamper to &; fro upon the tops of the woolly backs . And down this same street , in 1914 and again in 1940 , Auctioneer Moore saw the Elmbury Territorials march . <P> Like every country town , Elmbury had its respected eccentrics ( " ' T is summat in the air as breeds ' em , " was the usual explanation ) - men who drank twelve pints of beer at one sitting ; squires who spent their patrimony on crazy " Follies " ; Poor Tom , " who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who might have been seen almost any day happily bailing it out with a leaky bucket .
