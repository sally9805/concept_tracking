The President and Congress staged their expected perfunctory battle over subsidies last week , sounding much like tired stock-company players in rehearsals of a well-worn play . Vetoing the antisubsidy bill exactly as he had eight months ago , the President did not even bother to devise new epithets . He repeated that the bill was " an inflation measure , a high-cost-of-living measure , a food-shortage measure . " Half an hour after his message reached the Hill , the House failed , as anticipated , to override his veto . Each step of the routine was foreknown : passage , veto , veto upheld . The real fight was not yet . <P> That fight will come before June 30 , when President Roosevelt 's wartime price-control powers expire . These powers permit the President to pay subsidies for " strategic or critical materials . " Opposition Congressmen say they meant magnesium , chrome and mica ; the President has assumed , that they could also have meant butter , meat and milk . Congress may not take away the powers he has assumed -a two-thirds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they may well reduce those powers . Already the Farm Bloc 's Jesse P. Wolcott , Republican , of Port Huron , Mich. , was loading up a blunderbuss to blow holes in price control . <P> Unlucky Seven . Subsidies and price control were two key planks in the President 's seven-point 1944 legislative program . Congress has passed only one of the seven , the least important : mustering-out pay . The others have been pushed about , postponed or pigeonholed . One-the National Service Actis mackerel-dead . **29;17368;TOOLONG powers - was thrown around , then thrown into the tax bill . <P> The lastthe President 's request for a " realistic $10 billion tax bill " - reached him from Congress last week . It had been chopped to $2.3 billion . The President this week vetoed it - first time in 600-odd vetoes that he has rejected a tax bill . One question may be a mystery forever : low far was Franklin Roosevelt emboldened by the popular reaction to Willkie 's $16 billion plan to tax-till-it-hurts ? <P> Now , after five months of wrangling , weaseling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the veto held , Congress could start writing a new , deeper-digging bill-or Congress could stand pat for no new taxes . <P> More than ever , both Congress and the President Lad become quick to challenge , slow to compromise .
