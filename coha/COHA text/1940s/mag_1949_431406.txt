 | @# FRISBIE OF THE SOUTH SEAS I RECEIVED from Frisbie an undated letter written at Suvorov sometime after the hurricane that almost swept away the island . DEAR HALL : - As my friend Dr. B. , Ph.D. , would say : " Describe your material culture . " I will describe Suvorov 's and the Frisbie family 's , now that I 've had time to look around a bit . Suvorov 's may be dealt with in a word : Bones . It is , in sober truth , the mangled skeleton of the atoll that was . Most of the land the three white men were surveying when the Frisbie family arrived in January is now under the sea or in the bottom of the lagoon . A fragment of Anchorage Island remains , and here I poke around among the debris . I am really glad that I lost all my household goods . I could have salvaged some of the junk , but , except for a few essential things such as pots and pans , I let it lie . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having lost or discarded the odds and ends that weigh a man down as though they were Christian 's burden . More than anything else I am glad that all my old manuscripts are lost . There must have been a million words of them : monstrous children begotten often enough when I had mistaken the heat of madness for flashes of genius . Now all of the humpbacked , pigeon-breasted , deaf , dumb , mute , . blind-and-halt idiots are gone . Always there was the temptation to borrow from them . When my well-known creative genius lagged I would graft a malformed leg from one of the old children onto a newborn babe that might otherwise have turned into a well-formed offspring , but must now rest forever in the Museum of Monstrosities . While scrambling over the piles of rubbish where once grew Suvorov 's jungle , I would now ' and . again spy a typewritten sheet of paper , all but illegible . Stooping , I would pick it up and read , perhaps , Ages Long Ago : A Romance , by Robert Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight feeling of regret , all but lost in a stronger feeling of danger . This paper belongs to the past . Let the past be forgotten , . lest it fasten its cumbrous fingers on the future . But , alas , your letters went with the manuscripts . I had a collection of well over a hundred of them . I used to read them over and imagine that we were together talking as we did in the old days on your veranda at Artie , with a couple of Sarah 's tall frosted rum punches on the little table between us . I did find one packet of six letters , of various years . Each of them had something special to tell me , here on Suvorov . In one of them you wrote , " You are two men  --  Ropati and Robert Dean Frisbie , " and you went on to suggest that I suppress the R.D.F. and invite the Ropati.  | I believe that I am more than two men three ca. four , perhaps . But , Hall , Ropati is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want you to n member Ropati and forget the others . 17 Some time after this , Captain Andy Thomson picked up the Frisbie family and carried them to Manihiki atoll , in the northern Cook group . Lionel Trenn , an old friend of the three of us , was then Resident Agent on Manihiki , but shortly after Frisbie 's arrival there , Trenn was transferred to ? he island of Marigaia , in the southern Cooks . Frisbie 's next letters were written from Manihiki. @# I do n't know what day of the week it is , nor what month , and I am not entirely sure of the year . However , the fishing is fine , and we had a nice fresh rain-bath this morning . Tapuaikaha Islet is one of about five acres , three miles from Tauhunu Village , on the southwest . reef . Johnny his oldest daughter is in the Village and I am fretting for her return . Trenn built a house on this islet and we have taken it over since he left . It is nice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land crabs scuttling around in the bush , now and then stopping to poke their eyes out and wave their claws around as though they were semaphoring . The wind moans in the trees , the sea birds squawk , the land crabs click their claws , the reef combers thunder away day and night . Remember the last verse of the poem you sent me from the low island in the Tuamotus ? These are the voices of Roatu : The roar of the surf on the reef ; The wind in the fronds of the palms , And the shouts of the children at play . That 's how it is here . The voices of the children are those of Johnny , Jakey , Elaine , and Little ga . Lord knows why I am living here except , I suppose , that as the years go by I find it more and more impossible to live among people . I am not working . I have done no work for six months and feel not the slightest desire ever to work again . I am at peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to catch a fish , read a book , smoke a pipe , and teach my children their three R 's . But I 'm not doing so well with the latter and this worries me . I am not so certain as I was of my competence as a teacher . My conscience troubles me only with respect to the children , not at all with respect to the indolence of Author Frisbie . I remember that there are thousands of books written every year , some of them as good , perhaps , as I could write .

The exclamation points tell better than words could do what the nature of my reaction would be . I greatly enjoyed your letter about your schooner voyage with Nancy to the Gambier Islands . I 've no doubt that , she is a swell little daughter and was a perfect traveling companion . She may be nearly as fine a daughter as my Johnny . Hall , why in heck do we want to write mediocre books when we can create Number One daughters ? We do n't write , primarily , to make money ; our secret , hope is to perpetuate ourselves a little way on into the future . Well , have n't we , with our children ? Carumba ! With Nancy Ella and Johnny we have achieved immortality ! Why try to win a sham importance through authorship ? I tell you truly that every time my work is accepted I feel more than a charlatan a downright cheat . When I : . read my work in print I blush to think that I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only book I could produce without a sense of shame would be one like that I planned years ago . If I bared my soul it would not be a printable book , but . I would feel an honest man . This letter was of the kind I liked most of all to receive from Ropati : when he was at ease and " looking inward " with a kind of amused detachment of spirit . It increased my longing to see him again in the flesh . We continually planned for meetings but something always interfered to prevent our paths from crossing . Nevertheless , we kept our friendship warm and bright by means of let tern , although many of them went astray . He finished the one above quoted on the evening of the same day . This morning I wanted only another helping of Lotii , if that is the plural . Now I am worried again . Why ? Because Johnny is back from Tauhunu Village and I am reminded that I have duties to fulfill . Because I am so fond of Johnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in school somewhere and I ca n't send her . She is much more of a European or an American than I am . She has naturally nice ways , fine perceptions , and a sense of integrity . I have n't . The other children are little savages like their dad . Jakey and I get along fine because all we care about is fishing , eating , and sleeping . I do n't think he cares a whoop about aesthetic things . When I am enjoying the changes of light and color on the lagoon or palm fronds glinting in the moonlight , I do n't mention it to Jakey . Elaine , I think , will have Johnny 's capacity for becoming civilized , if ever she has a  | chance to learn what ' civilization is . Little Nga , like Jakey and Papa , will probably remain savage . My Johnny is nine , so your Nancy must be twelve . Hall , every year for you is one to the good . Nancy is catching up with you ; you 're not leaving her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixteen , almost a young man . You should worry ! But I should , and do , because my children are so much younger . Of course , I am much younger than you are , but my health ' is n't so hot . However , Andy will soon be coming north again . The moment I see glorious old Andy 's gold-toothed smile there will be nothing wrong with my health . 18 CAPTAIN ANDY was one of the few friends that Ropati held in his heart of hearts . He was an unusual kind of South Sea schooner captain . An American by birth , he had been sailing the tropical Pacific since his middle teens . He had gone to sea as a boy , so his formal education had been scanty . Melville said that whaling ships had been his Harvard and Yale ; copra schooners ? the Tagua , the T iare Taporo , and various others ? provided Captain Andy Thomson with his education , and well he had profited by it . He was endowed with a fine mind , and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voyages had given him a wide range of interests ; but he was no bookworm . A superb seaman , Andy was loved and deeply respected by his Polynesian sailors , who know ' what first-class seamanship amounts to . But why do I speak of him in the past tense ? IIe is still hale and hearty , still going to sea , and his stalwart sons , by a Rarotongan mother , have followed his profession . Early . in 1943 , Ropati and his children returned with Andy from Manihiki to Rarotonga . In August of that . year , my wife and daughter , Nancy , went to California to see our son , Conrad , who was in school near Santa Barbara . Failing other means of transportation , Colonel James M. Quinn kindly and generously granted them passage on a troop transport from the island of Bora Bora , in the Leeward Society group . Colonel Quinn was then in command of the U.S. Army troops occupying the base built at Bora Bora immediately after the Pearl Harbor disaster . Many troop transports , hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called-at Bora Bora on their way to and from islands in the Western Pacific . I felt lonely in my now empty house and had written Ropati about it . RAROTONGA , November 10th , 1943 There are only two cures for the kind of loneliness you ' speak of : reunion with the family , or alcohol . I can sympathize with you . Every time I have been away from my family I have wallowed in the depths of depression , particularly in the hours of the early morning , upon waking and fin ing myself alone ? no kids neatly dressed , fa washed , hair brushed , to say " Good morning Papa ! " But , Hall , what fools we are ! In reality we are suffering from an unacknowledged form egotism . If you are like me , you imagine that y children are crying their eyes out for you ; adding to their nightly prayers : " And dear Lord , plea send me back to my papa ! " The chances are that our children do n't give us two thoughts a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and picture shows , having a wonderful time , free from the inhibiting influences of their dads . I am speaking here only of myself ; no doubt it is different in your family . Just now we are living in a pretty little hour in Arorangi Village , not far from Andy 's place We have no servant . Johnny and I do the cooking and the other children help with the housework . Johnny is getting to be a big girl now , and she has a mind of . her own . At the present moment she is doing the family ironing . Like her dad , she is restless and wants to be on the move ; but the restlessness is chiefly due to the fact that there is no picture show here . She became addicted to the vile habit of movie-going when she was with me in Fiji . I wish I 'd never taken her to Suva . Imagine the effect upon the mind of a child whose life , until then , had been spent on Puka Puka . Did you ever try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That 's what I 'm doing now . Not in the hope of buying the boat . Why think of that any longer ? I need food for the family , and store teeth for the dad to eat his share with . Three years later this novel , published by Doubleday , Doran &; Company , appeared under the title Amara . I recognized it . at once as a story that Frisbie had tried to write a dozen years earlier . Either he had salvaged that old manuscript from sodden wreckage on Suvorov , or he had remembered enough of it to do what he had resolved never to do again : " graft a malformed leg from one of the old children onto a newborn babe . " The result was , as he had feared , another exhibit in the Museum of Monstrosities . About this same time in 1943 , George Weller. an American war correspondent . for the Chicago Doily , News , arrived at Tahiti to recover from malaria and poisoned feet , contracted in the jungles of New Guinea and Bougainville Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become acquainted with Frisbie . I-le gave me some disquieting news about Frisbie 's health and a touching account of his relationship with his children . Johnny , he said , although only ten , was the responsible head of the family and looked after her younger brother and sisters far better than her father was able to do . In January , 1944 , I followed my family to Cali- fornia and remained in the U.S.A. until the early autumn of 1945 . During this time Ropati and I t touch , and it was not until the end of the car that I heard from him once more . NAVY DISPENSARY , TUTU1LA . Noz'criiber .5th , 19-15 Off and on , I 've been in hospital since the first last April . Three times I 've been so close to ath that I know what , it is like to die . They have given me seven blood transfusions , and I have lost count of the plasma and dextrose . The trouble has not . been definitely diagnosed . I get . better , as now am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , faint , and lose as much as a gallon of blood in one hemorrhage . The only thing that really worries c is the fate of my children if I die . It is appalling , to think of my beloved Johnny becoming a little whore on the streets of Pago . They do n't ake daughters any finer than Florence Ngatokorua ( Johnny ) Frisbie . Oh , for the peace and stillness of Puka Puka . This dispensary is a madhouse . Think of it ! Every day at noon they turn on the radio and it blares on until ten at night . And they play nothing but the awfulest tripe . I really believe that Bob Hope , Charlie McCarthy , et al , are causing my hemorages . Oh , Hall , I got ta , get out of here ! Johnny and Jakey have just returned from a voyage around the Samoan group . They had two nights ashore at Swains Island . Their report makes me determined to go there . I saw it for a day in 1935 . Lord give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Samoa from Manihiki , in a Navy plane , at a time when it was thought , that tin was dying .. The children followed him later , also by plane , a great adventure for them . As with so many thousands of island children , the war had completely altered their way of life . Children who had never seen a ship larger than a copra schooner became suddenly familiar with great shipsof-war , submarines , tankers , troopships , hospital hips , to say nothing of aeroplanes . They lived as did their parents , in a kind of daze , not knowing which was reality : the old changeless life in which from birth to death their horizons were the same circles of sea and sky , or the new life suddenly foisted upon them when so many were shunted from place to place and from island to island as the necessities of war demanded . In the case of the Frishie children , it was their father 's health that demanded these changes . He was in a precarious condition throughout this year , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thirty miles from Apia . From this latter place he wrote , on March 31st , 1946 : ? I have been fairly well for two months . I find it possible to work for about three hours every other day . When I am strong enough it is important SOUTH SEAS 63 that I help Johnny with her book . We expect it will be finished on her birthday , July 19th . I will then make a clean copy for her and mail it in august . So , what with being somewhat weak and nny attention concentrated on transitions , chapter subjects , topic sentences , and general editing for Johnny , I have had no time to work on my own . However , Dairn Saits North is half done , and I expect to finish it between September 1st and December 31st . Now that . I am again a teetotaler , I find that , even with my hours curtailed , I can do more and better work than formerly . But of course it is Johnny 's book that interests me . Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a writer . Recognition of this fact- has given me a new lease on life . I mean to lire on , now , to see leer grow and develop . She 's young , of course , only thirteen , but shows wonderful promise as a writer . tier story is the simply told story of her life . In the first chapter she repeats what her mother told her of her birth in Tahiti . Then , in Chapter Two .. . Ropati went on to outline Johnny 's book , chapter by chapter . He rejoiced in her odd English expressions , in the way she mixed English with Puka Pukan speech . She was not yet able , of course , to think in English , but that would conic . Meanwhile , here she was , about to publish her first book when only thirteen years old . Her life was all before her , and starting a career of authorship so early , she would go far . If anything should happen to him , Johnny would be able to support her brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a success , and it would be , plans were already made for the second . It was to be a . child 's book called Jerry , the ASnroll Breeze , telling of the dangerous and exciting adventures of a. cat's-paw of wind , always trying to escape from the Big Wind who would swallow him whole . In the end the Big Wind catches him , and he finds that the frightful Ogre is no more than a great company of little breezes like himself . 19 I received one other letter from Ropati , in 1946 , written from Samatau. 1 . am still here , living on a diet of milk and oranges which is doing me more good than all the doctors and their panaceas . They nearly killed me in Pago . Johnny is with me just now , working on her book . We do n't know just where and how to end it . Maybe something will work out , like my conveniently dying to bring it to a proper climax . I have met here an English woodcut artist who is writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be illustrated by himself . I could have given him some pointers about where to go  | and what to see , but his attitude toward me is so plainly and obviously contemptuous that I snapped into my shell like a hermit crab . He regards me as a sort of beachcomber author , wearing a tinsel halo of " Romance . " Why is it that I have n't the personality of an author ? I suppose it 's because I am not respectable . No one but you , myself , and Johnny takes me at all seriously . Enough of this . I 'll hope to receive a good letter from you by Andy , with all the news from Tahiti , particularly news about yourself , Sarah , Nancy , and Conrad . Would n't our children be surprised if they knew of the deep and genuine interest taken in their welfare by their fathers ' old friends ? Or perhaps they would think it quite natural . I have n't seen Conrad and Nancy since they were little more than babies , and you have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Tahiti , sit on your veranda , and dispute with you the privilege as to who does the lion 's share of the talking ! Here I feel spiritually blighted . It is only keen interest in Johnny 's book that keeps me going . Hall , we 've got to meet once more , somewhere , somehow . I , too , longed for this meeting . World War II had ended , but instead of the expected renewal of trade in the Pacific , steamship lines resuming their old schedules between continents and inter-island services being re-established once more , the great Mother of Oceans seemed to have expanded to what she had been in the days before Wallis and Cook and Bougainville had explored her solitudes . Personally , I liked this , although the all but complete dearth of shipping was attended by a good deal of inconvenience to people living , supposedly , in the twentieth century . I had often feared that the world was shrinking to the size of a withered orange , and with the tremendous advance made in aviation I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II . Just the contrary happened . There was far more shipping ? in the eastern Pacific , at least ? one hundred years ago , in the days of the whaling ships , than there is today . As for planes , in so far as French Oceania is concerned , they might never have been invented . Americans , who take it for granted that the whole world is airminded , should visit French Oceania , supposing that they could find some means of coming here . The Polynesians of a thousand years ago had better methods of communication . Nevertheless , letters did occasionally  --  and still do ? , reach their destinations , sometimes in the same year in which they were posted . A letter from Ropati , from Letogo , Western Samoa , and dated January 6th , 1947 , reached Tahiti in May of that year . I was then in the U.S.A. Years ago when you returned from Iceland , having failed to write the book for Harper , you told me that a man is a fool to take money in advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolishness . I accepted a $2000 advance from Doubleday , and not a day 's peace have I known since . I am continually worried lest Dawn Sails North fail to come up to scratch . For the past two months I have written virtually nothing . Now , in desperation , I am moving the Frisbie family back to the Cook Islands . If we can get to Mangaia , the setting of Part III of the story , I believe I can finish the damned thing , after a fashion . Johnny 's book , Miss Ulysses from Puka-Puka , has been with the Atlantic Monthly for the past six weeks . I 'm afraid it 's a washout , due to the fact that Robert Dean Frisbie , mortal enemy of RopatiTanc , did too much meddling with it . We have been living here on a cattle ranch where they have horses to ride . There is a picture show twice a week , and a pretty good school . The kids have been very happy , but I 'm a sick man , HallTane . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sakes , but I think it unlikely . I have never recovered from all those hemorrhages . Six months or a year in the U.S.A. might help . I could turn myself over to the Navy doctors in Pago Pago ; and since I am a " veteran " of World War I , they would be obliged to send me home . But where could I leave the children ? There is no one this side of Puka Puka that could , or would , take care of them should I leave , or die . This is why I want . to return soon to Rarotonga . Should I die here , Johnny 's immediate fate would be ghastly . From the Cook Islands the children will at least be able to return to Nga 's relatives on Puka Puka . They will lose all that I have been able to give them in training and schooling , but at least they will be able to live as healthy savages . Who knows ? ' The Puka Pukan kind of savagery might be far better for them than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Certainly , they would not be living under the frightful conditions of the waifs and strays in Europe . Hall , I am so weary and weak . If only I could get my old energy back ! I enclose a snapshot of myself and the four children . Are n't they a fine lot ? Do you wonder that I 'm proud of them ? Here is some good news and I am not able to enjoy it as I want to . " Imam , the story that you have not yet written me about , has been translated into Swedish . I have just received a copy of the Swedish edition , the finest job of printing that I have seen . The paper is exquisite , the type attractive and clear . It is a far better job of bookmaking than they do in the U.S.A. Now for the second item of good news . Madame Gazel , wife of the French Minister to New Zealand , is translating my Book of Puka Puka into French . She found a copy of it by chance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from San Francisco to Auckland . I-laving learned my where- , bouts , she wrote , asking permission to make the translation , which I gladly granted . In another letter received from her recently , she writes that the work is nearly finished . And she further says : ? " As a writer you show true talent . The whole life on the small island of Puka Puka is depicted in an amazingly vivid way . I seem to know Mama , old William , Sea Foam , and the other characters . You have the same talent of the raccourirci which I admire in our French writer Colette , describing a scene or a character in a few words . " What a pity that you have not written more ! But it is never too late to do this , and I have hope of being your translator once again . I can not tell you how great a pleasure the work gives me . " How 's that ? I have talent . I am being translated into the foreign languages , including the Scandinavian . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think that was so hot . But if Sweden likes it , far be it from me to complain . The photograph enclosed was the first I had seen of Ropatis children and the first of himself since one he had sent me in 1929 when The Book of Puka Puka was published . There was a woeful contrast between the Ropati of 1929 and the one of 1947 ; it told me , far more poignantly than the letters had done , what he had gone through . His hair was still thick and dark , but the face was that of a youthful old man . It was haggard and drawn , with an expression upon it of deep suffering . But in his eyes there is a look of pride as he sits in the midst of his children with his arms around the shoulders of Little Nga and Johnny . The children are sturdy , healthy , bright-faced youngsters , a family that any father might well be proud of . Jakey and Nga show more of the mother 's blood , Elaine and Johnny more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well in his letters that it seemed to me ? that . I would have known them for his children even though he had not been sitting with them and I had come upon the photograph by chance . Johnny 's face in particular interested me . I could well understand why she was the very apple of her father 's eye . 20 I WAS again in the U.S. A. nearly the whole of the following year . My slaughter , Nancy , was married in Santa Barbara on April 5th , 1947 . I sent an announcement of the wedding to Rarotonga . Some months later I received the following letter : ? Hall , I wish I might have been there , but it 's just as well that I could n't come . What would I be doing in a church named All-Saints-by-the-Sea ? As far as that goes , how did you manage to get in , even for the marriage of your own daughter ? But I must have been there in spirit , even though I did n't know the wedding was forthcoming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ceremony clown to the small details . I wish I could , somehow , give Johnny three of my years and make her seventeen . Her book will soon be published by the Macmillan Company . If it sells well , maybe Johnny can stake her dad to a trip to the U.S. Six months up there would do me a lot of good , and I want Johnny to have it , to straighten out her sense of values . Lord ! but I do want her to go north . It seems to me that the past fifteen years of my life have been lived solely for her . She is a strange and remarkable girl , Hall . She is very beautiful , I think , and not in the least vain or self-conscious . She is modest , self-reliant , and has a strong sense of responsibility . She takes care of the house , does all the cooking and three quarters of my typing . I am writing this letter , but she does most of my correspondence . In a month or two she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie back for good and dictate my next book . IIer tastes are like mine , and so she helps me a great deal in my writing . She is able to sense the moods I try to express and helps me to do so . In fact , she is the only interest I have in life just now , so I find little pleasure in writing about anything else . But this does n't mean that I do not love the rest of the gang . I dote on them . They mean just as much to me as Johnny so far as love goes ; but from Johnny I have intellectual companionship as well . I 'll write again when I have finished Dawn Sails North for good and all . It has been impossible to write letters the past two years . When I try to , a sort of blocking psychosis sets in and I am unable to think clearly . Anyway , old friend , I hope we may meet once more , this side of the Stygian Creek . I returned to Tahiti at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ropati written less than a month before , and mailed in the Papeete post office . DEAR HILL : - I came with Andy on the Tiare Taporo . We both thought you were home again . I know how you will feel when you read this letter , and you can imagine how I feel writing it . I went as near to your house as the bridge over the little stream on the west side . I sat on the parapet for half an hour , but I could n't go into the house without : you there . Andy and I have been here for about three weeks . Ile could n't wait , of course , and we learned that you and Sarah would not arrive until around New Year 's . Tahiti was like a " Lost Island " to me , after an absence of fifteen years . Of course there were the @#  | same glorious mountains . Most likely they look no different now than they did when Polynesians first saw them , a thousand years ago . They are not even conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the coast . I found no friendly fellow insect except good old Spies . All the rest were , fonctionnaire insects ; Papeete seems to be crawling with them . I do n't wonder that they want to get away from France , but the Tahitians must be fed up , having to pay for their transportation halfway around the world and to support them after they get here . I walked along the waterfront . It was good to see the copra schooners and cutters still moored there . I saw two or three tolerable small boats , but I 'm no longer interested in them . I hate to leave this note , but you 'll know we 've been here , so I guess I 'd better . A few months later I received a letter from Captain Andy , telling me of the Tahiti visit and how Ropati had wandered aimlessly along the streets of Papeete , looking for a few old friends . " With Nordhoff , Jones , and Russell dead and you not there , Ropati was like a mute at a funeral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been taking better care of himself lately . His eldest daughter , Johnny , has grown up to be a lovely girl . Some day I hope she 'll marry a first-class fellow who will make her a good husband . She deserves the best . " Ropati 's last letter was written from Rarotonga , in September , 1948 . The greater part of it was concerned with Johnny 's book , which had been published earlier in the year by the Macmillan Company under the title Miss Ulysses from Puka-Puka . He then mentioned his own manuscript that he had been so long in finishing . After working two and one-half years on Dawn Sails North and producing a minor Moby-Dick ? or , anyway , a. book nearly as long ? Doubleday compelled me to delete 250 pages and add more plot . Having advanced me money , they had me by the what-you-call-'ems , and I could n't , with honor , refuse . So , if you read Dawn Sails North ? and I ca n't recommend it ? . bear in mind that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After theses many years I 've taken your advice and am reading Chaucer . I did n't suppose I could , but I 'm surprised to find how easily I learned his English . I still read Proust . Recently I finished Volume VII , The Past Recaptured . It was my fourth rereading of the whole work . Now I 'm going to give my set to a friend and keep on with Chaucer . It looks as though I 'd gotten mixed up in my reading , going from the twentieth century back to the fourteenth . You know how I feel about Proust , but I have to admit that there 's more health in a page @# of Chaucer than in the whole seven volumes Proust . And health is what I need just now . 21 ONE day late in November , 1948 , I went in : Papeete to do some errands . There was a cro " + of people on the waterfront . I learned that a wireless message had been received only an hour befor. announcing the arrival of a U.S. Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Tahiti . The plane , routed via Rarotonga in the Cook Islands , was expected at any moment We soon sighted it , far off to the southwest . It made a beautiful " landing , " so-called , in the lagoon. and the pilot boat went out to bring the passengers ashore . Among them was my old friend George Weller , of the Chicago Daily News . When I recovered a little from my surprise and pleasure at seeing him , Weller said : " Hall , I 've bad news . for you . Robert Frisbie is dead . " He had n ' details , for the plane had remained at Rarotonga only long enough to refuel . He had not seen Ropati 's children , but had met my friend Lionel Trenn , whose hastily written letter George had brought . Weller was obliged to go with the Inspector of Colonies to call upon the Governor of Tahiti . During his absence I went to the park by the waterfront to read Trenn 's letter . Ropati had died very slid : denly only ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad blow for all of us here , and especially for his children . A Rarotonga woman has taken them into her home for the present . You will not be surprised to learn that Ropati died penniless and deeply in debt . " Although I had long prepared myself for such news , the preparation counted for nothing . His last letter had been received only a month before . It was in this same park that we had sat , talking . throughout the afternoon on the day of our first meeting nearly thirty years before ; and by the sea wall fronting the park he had tried to dream his boat into reality . I could hear his voice , saying : " She 's sturdy . Nothing for speed , but that does n't matter . I 'm in no hurry . And the important thing is that I can handle her myself . " Many a time during the intervening years I had seen her there , a phantom ship , waiting for him . Now he was standing by the sea wall , no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Young Ropati , the Dreamer , was ready at last to embark . IIe unmoored his phantom ship , drew in the v varnished gangplank , hoisted sail , and steered for the passage to the open sea . He turned to give me a farewell wave of the hand . I watched the lit tie ghost ; ship growing smaller and smaller as he headed west-by-north for the ghost of an island ? Suvorov : or Frishie 's Island , as he had loved to call it .. End )
