One year ago six Japanese fighter pilots sighted their first 6-29 high over the Himalayas . They jumped the big ship , then broke off as its guns blinked . One of them went down ; two others were damaged . The most formidable U.S. warplane had received its baptism of fire . <P> By last week Japan 's own skies echoed to the roar of 6-29 motors . Airfields on Kyushu whence enemy planes have been attacking U.S. positions on Okinawa were furrowed by exploding bombs . Intent bombardiers sighted carefully and began an anniversary celebration that was to go on for three straight days of attack . <P> In one year the Superfortresses had come far . Operational losses , once admittedly as high as 5% , were now negligible . Small , ineffective raids , spaced about two weeks apart at first , had grown to 400-plane raids at two-day intervals . More than 60,000 tons of bombs have been dropped on Japan , almost twice the 37,000 tons U.S. and R.A.F. planes dropped on all Europe in 1942 . New U.S. fire bombs have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated that 40% of Japan 's plane production was gone , that 50% of metropolitan Tokyo , 20% of Kobe and Osaka , more than 10% of Nagoya had been burned out . 6-293 have destroyed 395 Jap planes in the air , racked up another 301 probables , smashed 106 on the ground . <P> The Japanese openly wince under the lash of the 6-293 . Cried Radio Tokyo : " The enemy seems bent on using them to destroy utterly the Yamato race in a manner far greater in fury than any bombings our Axis partners in Europe experienced .
