U.S. Senator Harley M. Kilgore , sweating and aggressive , paraded official witnesses before his subcommittee on war mobilization . His aim was to compile information for anti-cartel legislation . What emerged was proof that industrial Germany had been neither defeated nor destroyed , and that only a strong Allied policy could keep down the German will to war . <P> The most disturbing facts were those of Foreign Economic Administrator Leo T. Crowley . Their substance : <P> In 1944 , despite bombings and manpower shortages , the German economic and industrial machine achieved its highest production level in history . An uncontrolled Germany would have the wherewithal to stage another war in five years . Among Germany 's surviving assets : Four million tons of machine tools and capacity to produce much more . A dye and chemical industry virtually untouched by war . <P> Equipment and resources to produce annually 25 million tons of iron and steel , far in excess of peacetime needs , and a capacity to make 250,000 tons of aluminum a year . <P> Nitrogen-producing equipment only slightly damaged . Similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric power , electrical and electronic equipment , wood products , precision and optical instruments . <P> The New Krupps . In addition to these tangible assets German industry has a will to survive , and a wiliness to match . Other testimony presented before the subcommittee disclosed that when defeat became certain the Nazis took three steps , in an effort to insure postwar operation of the Krupp industries : 1 ) Government control was eliminated , so that Krupp became technically a " private industry " ; 2 ) Nazis were expelled from Krupp personnel ; and 3 ) the Krupps were accused of ( but not prosecuted for ) defeatist and anti-Nazi sentiments . <P> Other tactics were more obscure . Records of technological and research advancements were destroyed or carefully hidden . Nazi laws forbidding export of capital were eased to permit German industries to build up assets abroad . German industrialists hoped to strengthen themselves through international borrowing and cartel agreements , weakening the will of the Allies to take punitive measures . <P> In Argentina , said Assistant Secretary of State William L. Clayton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one had been completely eliminated . <P> The Darkened Path . The subcommittee was told that U.S. and Allied policy still fell far short of meeting the problem . Said a Crowley statement : " We have still to agree on and to begin to apply a detailed , specific , unified economic and industrial disarmament program which will eliminate the German war potential as a part of a unified occupation program . " <P> Said the War Department 's lean , hardbitten Major General John H. Hilldring : " We are still feeling our way along a path which lies more in darkness than in light . "
