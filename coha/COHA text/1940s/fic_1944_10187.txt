ALONG the rivers , somewhere in the darkness of the deep South , Wagnal said  --  and it is deep and dark still , for there are thousands of empty houses down there sitting like the castoff skins of cicadas beside roads that are no longer roads , houses whose people have never been told about , houses long dead but unburied on a battlefield of time and hate and envy and indifference  --  somewhere there was a little musketry and some fast hoofbeats on a plank road perhaps . Beating up some pickets , Clint said . We 'll be in Vicksburg before the month 's out . By GodWhat ails you , Clint ? I said . The shelling , he said . They 've ceased firing again . Last night we could see the sky lit up from the mortars . He got up and went to the window of the dining-room . You 're looking the wrong way , I said  --  and besides you could n't see from here anyway . Too low , too many trees . They 're still in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clint said . The place looks like an open grave . By God , Old Sam made ' em burrow . Ten dollars it 's fallen , Thomas . Say , what 's the date ? The date ? I said . Why , let me see  --  it 's the fourth of July . Bully ! Clint said . Ten dollars it 's fallen . You do n't know these people , I said . Twenty it has n't . Shall we join the ladies ? Katherine was nervously picking at a high key on the harpsichord , and Una was saying : Do shut up , Kitty . Nothing 's happened to Grandfather . Nothing could . He 's too vicious and contrary . You worry about that old man when I  --  we have n't heard from Father in months . That vulgar old  --  Una saw us in the doorway . Ah , Colonel , she said . Coffee will be along . Doctor , Katherine said , the vexed fiery frown coming over her face , there 's something wrong tonight , I feel it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lighter . Before I could answer , Clint said with a foxgrin : There are no cannon firing , Miss Theron . I have just laid a wager with the lieutenant that Vicksburg has fallen . That 's it , Katherine said . The quiet . That damned rumble and then the quiet . Here , she said , her voice tight and words fast , here , Colonel are weapons . I fetched them in from the armory . On a sofa lay a long sheaf of old rapiers , with gold , silver and jewelled hilts . She whipped one up from the sheaf and quirted it in the air . It sang like a whip . Look , look , Colonel , what can you do with this ? She pointed to the half-inch tapestry head of a French court dandy on the sofa back , assumed the on guard , holding the silver hiltp101lightly , her short fingers almost languid under the engraved figure eight guard of the sword , and lunged . The sharp point punked through the threadbrains of the dandy and out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is my furniture , you little  --  Katherine pulled the rapier from the wounded head and a tuft of hair stuck out the hole where the eyes of the courtier had been . Dead and scalped , Katherine cried and threw down the sword . Dead . Grandfather 's dead ! Be still , Una said , nothing could kill Grandfather . He 's dead all the same , I know it , Katherine said staring at the hole in the sofa , her darkblue eyes wild . Rass brought in the silver coffee pot and the cups and set them on the marbletopped table . Rass , Katherine said . Rass , saddle Niobe and ride to Grandfather  --  find Grandfather fast ! Yes , Miss Katherine . What shall I say to him ? Do nothing of the kind , Rass , Una said . We do n't know where he isA bell jingled and someone beat upon the front door . Katherine ran out of the room , the big black following fast . Coffee , Colonel ? Una said . Cream ? Lieutenant ? She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Clint said . I was listening for the doors . I heard them and then voices in expostulation : No , somebody was saying , but I 'm not  --  Bring him in here , Rass , Katherine 's voice said . We 'll soon see . Katherine came in first , dragging the drummer boy by the ear . He looked pinker and prettier and more sullen than usual . Rass had the Crimean by the scruff of the neck and was bending one arm behind him . Drop it , you bloody bugger ! Crime said , trying to reach the British non-com 's sword he was wearing in defiance of one of Clint 's Special Orders . No bloody nigger 's  --  Sergeant ! Clint said , sharply pompous . Colonel , . sir , Crime said . Let him go , Rass , Katherine said . I suppose they 're his men . Crime shook himself . The drummer rubbed his ear and scowled . What are you doing here , sir ? Clint said . And you ? I thought I told you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir  --  But I 've told you never to follow me  --  and you , young man ! But Colonel , sir , Crime said . If the colonel pleases , sir , hi come to tell the colonel the news , sir . Yes ? Well , sir ? And also , sir , there 's another matter  --  What 's the news ? Well ? Vicksburg 's fallen , sir . General Pembertonsurrendered last night ; and the garrison marched out this afternoon . You owe me twenty , Clint said to me . But colonel , sir  --  if the colonel pleases  --  Una made a move to go Please , Clint said . We 'll just step into the hall . Come , boy , he said to the drummer . Katherine and Una and I watched them silently for a moment . Oh , Lieutenant , Clint said from the door . I excused myself and went with them . Beggin ' your pardon , sir , Crime said , they said they was paroled and was bringing the bloody body home . Casualty ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir  --  ' e was shot in a dool . Come , Mibble , who is he ? One Theron , sir , Crime said , a buggering Rebel brigadier . They got ' im on a caisson wrapped up in a blahsted Secesh banner . Dressed like a proper toff ' e is too  --  pipeclay belts and a bleedin ' shiko , like a ' ero with a buggerin ' milit'ry hescort . They let them past the regiment ? Clint said . Who did it ? Captain ' Anks done it , Crime said . ' E said seein ' as ' ow they ' ad n't got no weepons but a sabre or two and they 'd been paroled , it could n't do no ' urt to fetch the old gent ' ome  --  ' im bein ' dead . Killed in an haffair dahner ' e was over a lidy . ' E 's a ' ero all right . Crime grinned . How the hell do you know , Mibble ? Clint said . Straggler come along from Vicksburg and sees the caisson and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got plugged in a dool over gittin ' inter bed with the wrong wife , aint'y ? A young Rebel leftenet pulls out his sword and yells : Shut your filthy Yankee mouth . How long Katherine had been standing in the doorway of the drawingroom I do n't know , but she said : That 's Grandfather all right . Her face was stone still , and her voice was low . Go tell them , she said to Crime , to fetch him in . Yes , Miss , Crime said , bowing . At once , she said . Yes , Miss , Crime said backing away as he bowed . Had n't you better let us handle this , Miss Theron ? Clint said . You could send a servant to make sure . Perhaps it is not yourDear Colonel , Katherine said , I knew my grandfather was dead  --  I know this is my grandfather by the way he died . I 'll tell my sister . Una was coming through the door with Rass following her . Grandfather'sdead , Una , Katherine said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She smiled . He was killed in a duel over a woman . It must have been an accident , Una said ,  --  I mean his being killed . Yes ; it must have been , Katherine said . Rass , fetch the lanterns . Miss Theron , I can not allow  --  Clint said . Katherine swung open the double doors ; and the yellow perfumed light of the candles in the great glass chandelier of the hail flowed over the pink marble slabs of the porch to the edge of the gravel drive . The park remained dark and unpenetrated , until we saw a light swinging in its depth.  |p103Rass  had come with two lanterns . Katherine took one from his hand . Come Rass , Katherine said , we 'll meet him . She did not hold up her skirt but dragged it down the steps of the piazza , the blue silk , ghastly now in the lantern light , sweeping a trail in the drive . Rass followed her . The lowswung lanterns pointed up little snowy crystals in the gravel . Their feet plunch-plunched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the Spanish moss hanging , like an inert and poisonous fog , in the damp forest air . Cold mossfronds brushed my face ; and I could feel small things crawling on my skin as we walked toward the light in the park . I could hear the peculiar cumbrous rattle of the caisson and the jingle and creak of the horsesoldiers riding at a walk in the night . After a while we could see them through the cavelike curtain of moss . There were only three of them : one riding the lead horse of the caisson and one on either side of the caisson . Their shoulders were hunched forward  --  even the man who held the smoky pinetorch did not hold it high . The hungry cadaverous horses were hardly moving but all three men had fine smart uniforms ( brought in by the father and sold to the grandfather at a handsome profit ) , only a little dusty . The caisson lumbered to a stop and stiffly one of the men got down from his saddle and walked  --  with his shoulders thrown back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of Katherine and swept off his black plumed shako as if he were a matinee idol . Have I the honah of addressing Mizzus Theron ? Katherine was holding the lantern high : before he bowed I could see he had a white lank face that had once been plump with an ill-cultivated. set of short whiskers : He looked hungry and nervous and sullen . His black hair was straight and long , and , in the lanternbeam , seemed greased with tallow . As he bowed a sprig of moss brushed his face , but he did not raise a hand . He 's my grandfather , Katherine said . Then I have the honah  --  the man began all over again . Katherine Theron  --  Miss , Katherine said . Then , Miz Theron , it is my unpleasant duty to inform you that your grandfather , Brevet Brigadier-General Fulke Theron , died while performing his duty  --  Yes , Katherine said , his duty to womankind . But , Miz Theron  --  And to whom have I the honor of speaking , sir ? Katherine said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now  --  up until today  --  attached to the staff of General Theron . Well , Lieutenant Ocamb , my sister and I are grateful for you bringing my grandfather home . Will you and your men accept dinner and a rest here ? But before we go near the house , tell me what happened . Miz Theron it was duty  --  I have already heard , Katherine said . Well , Miz , the Lieutenant said , there is  --  was  --  a man at Vicksburg who keeps a gambling house ; and Gen'l Theron tried to stop him preyingon the soldiers . It was his duty , ma'am  --  Who was the woman ? Katherine said . There was no  --  Who was she ? Katherine said . Well , Miz Theron , there was a female that some said was the gambler 's wife . Ah , Katherine said . What was her name ? Bonnie , the lieutenant said . Bonnie what ? I 'm suah I do n't know , ma'am . I nevah heard her called anything else . Pretty , I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I know , Lieutenant Ocamb . Now we 'll go to the house  --  but how was it my grandfather was killed in a duel ? They used the gambler 's pistols , ma'am ; and the one your grandfather had missed fire . Careless ! What is this gambler 's name ? Katherine said . I can truthfully say , ma'am , I nevah knew what his name was . Oh , Katherine said . Who did that ? Well , ma'am , I had my own brace of pistols with me and when I saw the charge and priming of your grandfather 's weapon  --  I see , Katherine said . Did n't you exchange cards ? Well , ma'am , aftah that pistol bein ' found like it was , I did n't really considah that the man even desuhved  --  Oh , Katherine said . Except for the creak and lumber and crunch of the caisson and the feet and hooves , there was nothing but silence in a macabre and perambulatingring of light canopied by the shaggy moss trailing from the liveoaks . As we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outer ripples of our light , Katherine said suddenly : Where are the dogs ? Dogs ? the lieutenant said . Grandfather took two mastiffs to the wars . Oh , Donne and Huhbut , he said . Yes , Donne and Herbert , Katherine said . They were lost , ma'am . Lost ? They never get lost . What happened ? Well , ma'am , people were hungry in Vicksburg . Damn you ! Katherine said . You did n't eat  --  No , ma'am , he said . No ! Then what in the name of God  --  Well , ma'am , many of the soldiers were n't buried deep , there bein ' nobody to dig much but caves , and  --  well , the dogs were shot a month ago . The gen'l almost had the man who did it shot himself . Oh , Katherine said . The gen'l had them buried deep , Ocamb said . Una was standing on the porch with the light from the open doors behind her , her perfume all around her in the stagnant air . The couchpI05in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two soldiers and I were taking him in the red flag flopped back from his face . It had already begun to blacken  --  like the faces of those boys at Shiloh . But Katherine fell upon it with both her arms and kissed it wildly . Before Clint and I and Crime and the drummer boy left for camp that night , Rass and I put old Fulke Theron in a long Elizabethan clothes press  --  and Rass went to the burial ground with a shovel and a lantern . You could hear the river and see the candleflames in the bayonets licking the nightair , for the men had rolled up the tentwalls in spite of the mosquitoes and bugs . The Ohio battery had a gun unlimbered near a ford ; and the cannoneers were playing poker by bayonetlight . Somebodywas singing obscene words to Dixie on commissary whiskey . Rome was in his tent writing to his wife and daughter , Myra , back in Knoxville . A guard had been mounted around the tent which Crime had pitched for Clint  --  and a guard around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vicksburg has fallen , when Clint came to our tent . Gentlemen , Clint said , I want to talk to you . Will you come to my tent and have a drink ? Why , yes , Clint , Rome said . And before I forget it , Captain Hanks , I have asked Washington for that majority of yours  --  and your captaincy , Dr. Wagnal . Why , thank you , Cl  --  Colonel Belton , Rome said gravely . Crime had the candles lighted in Clint 's tent and the cigars on the table . Brandy , sir ? he said as if he were a stage butler . Lend an ear to this , Clint said and began reading an order praising the regiment . Where each performed his duty so well , it would be invidious to particularize , the order said . It mentioned neither Rome nor me and ended with a description of the Theron place , a quotation of the clipping from the Vicksburg sun and a recommendation that the male Theron still alive be prosecuted as a traitor when caught  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much dysentery and misery and as many rashes as the Rebels had , Wagnal said . And we had houses back home with suitsp106of civilian clothes in them and perhaps a book we had n't read and the copies of Harper 's Weekly accumulating fatly week by week in our minds and closets to say nothing of our leftbehind traps and trinkets and the girls we knew and the trees and hitching posts along the streets . We could think of those things and how new they would be to us  --  and think how easy the life at home would be after sloshing around bayous and swamps and rivers with a bellyache and a hot forehead and the squitters . But they could not think that way : they could only lie awake and wonder if the damned Yankees had got to their hometown or their plantation or their cabins and burnt their houses , dosed their mulattoes , put molasses in their pianos , taken their horses and their books and their pictures  --  and even their women and girls . They could only hope that they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got a minie ball in the gizzard or a decent meal instead of greencorn . We kept following them and pushing them along a little way at a time . And Old Joe Johnston would turn around and scratch us like a wildcat and slink away . But we never had anything more like Shiloh . We went home  --  the whole regiment  --  in the Spring of sixty-four . The home guard met us at the boat with a brassband . It was n't like the time we marched down to the levee in St. Louis to go down to Pittsburgh Landing . Oh no ; everybody was there  --  and we marched through the streets with bayonets fixed , proudshabby uniforms brushed and Clint at our head on a black mare which the city gave him riding beside the mayor and waving that black Jeff Davis dresshat that had come down the river for the flag presentation after Shiloh . Rome 's wife and daughter , Myra , came to meet him and stayed until Rome had gone to one of the banquets the city gave for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's who had failed to get a colonelcy , made a redundant speech in the square . It was all about coming back a little weary , not vanquished , not despairing of the Cause , not unwilling to make greater sacrifices for the salvation of Your Country , but coming back battlescarred veterans , brilliant in deeds of heroism . He bore down hard on that ; and I saw Sleepy Bates and the toothless boy squaring their shoulders and strutting even as they stood at parade rest . He said we came to rest a little at our own firesides and the bosom of God and our own kith and kin . Ah , now , Wagnal said , I remember . He swung out an arm and let his voice drop low , the judge . He was the kind of a man that everyp107farmer and housewife in Kansas would call a good talker  --  just a dandy talker . When he dropped to that low , thrilling , confidential tone , the soldiers , the firemen  --  lined up with their red hosecarts and their brassboundengines  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all felt the cold crawl on their spines and their tear ducts let loose . I refer to the battle of Shiloh , the Judge said , in which your major , now Colonel Clinton Belton of the Hundred and Seventeenth Ioway Volunteer infantry  --  a veteran regiment  --  and we look for him to go much farther both under the glorious flag of our Union as a soldier and under its re-united stars as a statesman  --  was stricken down after acts of Spartan heroism in which he vanquished nearly singlehanded and with only one cannon the furious attack of a vaunted Rebel regiment of Louisiana Grays . I could see the set sardonic face of Crime beside Shire Newton who was holding the colors ; and I could see Rome look down to the dust in which he stood , before the crowd broke into cheers as the judge 's voice gathered volume and thundered to a period . Bates and the toothlessboy were looking down too . Clint responded as modestly as a young virgin . He talked of our training at Keokuk and how a friendshiphad sprung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ladies especially for all the kindness they had done us ( two soldiers had gone to Shiloh with the clap ) and ended by praying God to reward those who had not returned with us for laying down their lives in their Glorious Union 's defense . Then I saw him signal Crime , and Crime hand his musket to the drummer boy . Nah ! Crime yelled at us : Three cheers for the good people of Keokuk ! Well , there must have been a good deal of underbreath oaths wasted , for few liked Crime by that time . Everybody knew that the wooden horses were waiting in the wagons parked in Mississippi ; and besides there were a good many of us who had bought things in Keokuk for four times the right price before we left . But the regiment cheered . By God , Wagnal said , you can always get a regiment to holler  --  and most of the lads had their eyes on those girls in the frilly dress and ribands , so all the heroism they could grab was needed toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular wedding night . After the cheers for the townspeople , Crime had them yell for the judge and Clint . And then a fire chief , who had two front teeth missingp108just like the lad in the regiment , crawled up on top of the brassfunnel of the engine and yelled three big cheers and a tiger for the brave boys of the Hundred and Seventeenth Ioway ! He lisped ; and some of the boys put their fingers on their cartridge-biters and winked . But the crowd yelled : Hooray ! Hooray ! Hooray ! Wheeeeeee ! Clint had the regiment dismissed and went about shaking hands with all the city fathers and the women from the Sanitary Commission and the knitting club women . They were all voters . Before the banquet , or supper , as they called it , a committee of women came to me and asked me to present Clint with a bouquet of roses , as I was then surgeon of the regiment , and , I suppose , at that time had a voice and a beard as imposing as my frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made about beauty and chivalry  --  but I can see Clint getting up , the tasseled end of his silk sash dragging over the white tablecloth in the Estes House . His fine sleek curly beard and his Greekgod head and his eye of Mars , calculating and cunning . He paused , took the flowers reverently in his arms and put his face into them and inhaled deeply . Ladies , he said , I accept these in the name of my  --  of our  --  brave men still on active service  --  and those finally mustered out . I accept with alacrity these lovely tokens from lovely hands , for it is such moments as this that help us to walk into the Valley of the Shadow of Death Down There . I can say no more but that we all thank you from the bottom of our souls  --  and I am sure that I speak also for those who have answered the last long roll but are , I know , gathered here in spirit . Clint held a pause  --  a long one  --  , Wagnal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare move  --  nor did they want to move . For Clint was another of the tribe of men to whom women will listen with awe and remember long and quote much as wise , until , three generations later , his political euphemisms will still be echoing : It 's just like Grandma used to say about those that have passed away are gathered here in spirit . Oh , Clint was shrewd : When he finished the pause , he broke the silence softly , his voice almost crooning : And now I 'm going to ask a hero to pronounce the benediction , Chaplain John Simpson . Old Simpson got up and looked around him . Since Shiloh he had been surgeon to another Iowa regiment , for he had had enough of praying impotently . His face was long and dour , with shadows in the creases . It looked like a relief map of the soul of St. Paul . Women used to use his name to frighten their children into obedience . As he rosepI09in the kerosene lamplight of the Estes House , I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackpowder ring around his mouth and the bloodshot eyes under the moth shadow  --  and I heard the guns of the Tyler and Lexington on the Tennessee and heard Grant saying , sixteen years . Ah , horses ! And then I heard Buell 's regiments slishsloshingup from the Landing . And I remembered how I helped bury Rome 's brother in the morning with a tincup and a bayonet . Your great granduncle , boy . God grant health and sun and peace , Simpson said , to all the wounded . His voice vibrated with something like rage . Almighty God grant that this war will soon be over and that all may go back to their homes . But most of all give us to know the truth without slaughter . Amen . Now there was a pause . You could feel the charge of embarrassment in the air of the Estes House diningroom  --  feel the disapproval of the women straining at their faces and vocal cords . You could hear the oil-lamps sputter and the foot of a waitress on a creaky board . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the city fathers , or affirmed for God which side He was on . But I could see a good many of the boys thinking , by Jesus , he 's right . Ole Simpson 's right . It do n't make a damn ' just so 's the thing 's over  --  for it ai n't like I thought it was . I saw Clint nod to the Crimean again , and the Crimean get up and yell : Three cheers for the ladies ! There were three for the ladies and three for the colonel and three for the chaplain and three for me and three for General Crocker , who commanded the brigade , and then three for the Army of Tennessee and , finally , three for General Grant . Then someone probably a little drunk started : Yes , we 'll rally round the flag , boys ! We 'll rally once again , shouting the battlecry of freedom ! By the time they had got to , Down with the traitor , up with the star , all the women had joined in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their faces . It was n't any battlecry to the soldiers , but it was to the women . To the soldiers it was just a song with words to roll over their tongues . Down with the traitor might as well have been tiddy-um-dee-dee . The soldiers who were n't catching the train to go home and take off their shoes and lie still and eat and look at their traps and the streets and their front yards and the hometown girls and the streetlamps and the grocerystore and maybe the books they had not read and some thatp110they had read , strolled out of the Estes house with girls , still humming bits of war songs . Rome and Mrs. Hanks and Myra said goodbye to me ; and , as they left , Clint came up to me . Well , Thomas , Clint said , I 'm going early on the way back . Way back where ? I said . Back South . I 'm going to stop in Mississippi  --  Messenger 's Ferry . Are you coming with me ? Katherine Theron 's young and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old one and a good one . I do n't think she has so much to learn , I said . Ah well , Clint said , not so much style as her sister , but  --  I beg your pardon , Colonel , I said , she has more . Ah ! Clint said . So the fair Katherine has laid siege to your heart , young man ? Are you to be my brother-in-law ? Perhaps you 're to be mine , Clint , I said before I thought . I saw the hard glitter of his eyes under the Jeff Davis hat and heard him say : Well , sir , I am staying here at the Estes House for a few days , and then I shall go to Davenport  --  and thence to Mississippi . Let me know , Thomas , if I can expect your company . He walked away quickly as I saw Sleepy Bates coming toward me with a pretty ovalfaccd girl in a ruffled , ribboned dress , her mouth red and primped as smalltown girls used to do  --  and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was saying . You do n't say ! It ai n't reely so . Sure is , Bates said . Well , I hope you get all those awful Rebels killed good and quick , she said . Oh , they ai n't so awful , Bates said . We shoot at them too . Yes , she said , but they 're reel mean and keep niggers and wanta break up the Union and kill everybody . But you sure whipped ' em , did n't you ? They passed without seeing me and struck out under the big elms and maples which were just budding . The street was n't paved ; and there were stone hitching posts in front of the houses . Everything looked as if men with names had put it there  --  not as it is now : the paved streets and the electric street lights all made in great quantities by men who have no names but such-and-such , inc . And the quiet trees and the grass saying , we used to be hosts here long ago  --  but now we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wagnal said , I did n't much like the wind and the rain in Edinburghwhen I was a young medical , but I would go back to that now , if I could be young . For even in Auld Reekie then , you could turn a cornerout of a wynd and find a plot of green or a tree that was still a tree . God ! You could feel young and green and your thoughts could creep around all the things of the world in an instant and you could lovep111and sing and go into a pub and drink a dozen pints and argue loud and long with Dick Ames . God help me , boy , I 'm old and Katherine is dead and Dick 's dead at Savage 's Station and Clint Belton 's dead in New England and Una caught pneumonia in a topless Worth gown and died in Washington . Here , he said , pouring more whiskey into the communion goblets , have a drink . So many are dead now that were young . Why , God , there was the young artillery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young and sharp , with eagle-eyes and a sweet smile . That 's what I 'm going to do , he said to me when I bandaged his wound . As soon as this is over I 'm going to Baltimore and study to be a doctor  --  and maybe I 'm going to Edinburgh . They say that 's a good place . Do you know anything about it , Doctor ? There were minie balls clipping the trees all around the end of Peach Tree street . You could hardly hear and it was hot as hell and we were all weary with the heat and sweat and dust  --  but we two stood there and talked . And I told him about Dick Ames finding Red Mary 's corpse that many of us had swyved many 's the time and what a beauty she was and how gay and dashing ; and all about the middleclass bereaved who bought spring guns and mortsafes for the graves of their smug dead . It 's black and smoky and it 's raw and it rains like hell , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : By God , Doctor , I can see it now . I think I 'll desert now and learn to use a scalpel instead of a spherical case . It 's neater . Why , I never saw that boy again  --  and I never knew his name  --  but I can still see his face and the brass 45th Ohio on his collar and the mole on his triceps and a garnet ring he wore on the little finger of his right hand and the battledirt in the wrinkles of the cuticle and the dried blood . I can see it . It is as if I could take time as one takes a telescope and close it tight again , leaving only a little space between the ends . Oh , I can see the boards in the breastworks and the mudcovered wheels of the Napoleons that the Rebels had left behind at the end of Peach Tree street and the springless wagon in the street and the old man with the ox team and the bank with the top off it after the fire . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white fences , where few , if any , shells had fallen  --  a street where there were no soldiers lying on the grass , a street that was cool for a few moments before dawn andp112secret and serene as the streets of a little town in America used to be long ago  --  not long ago in time , but long ago in some obscurity . There is the antiquity of Greece and Rome and Egypt ; and to prove it there are stones that still stand and grasses that grow between them and lizards that lie upon them . But there is the antiquity of little American towns at night that is the antiquity of a wilderness , which is the loneliness , the secretness , the obscureness of the earth . The little towns were strange at night and every house looked out upon the earth , the grass and trees , that for twenty thousand years had heard no mournful engine whistles , no long trains of freight cars which , at the empty streetends , sound like running water . Every house was closed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses sleeping . And in the parks there were wooden bandstands and captured guns from Shiloh or Chickamauga or Chancellorsville or Gettysburg  --  and later from Cuba . And the towns slept most of the day under the sun or the snow or the rain , but at night they did not really sleep , for their terrible ancientness and obscurity were abroad in the night ; and the wind in the trees was a sly ghost wind . And all time was in the houses in the little towns  --  the houses that had not been built a half a century . Boy , Wagnal said , everything is strange : You sitting there on that kitchenchair ; that wellcut suit you 're wearing . Who made it ? A tailor in London . Jermyn street , I said . God , Wagnal said . A tailor in London . Jermyn street . Is it not strange that you are sitting here in Fork City , Kansas , in a boxcar house , talking to a mad renegade preacher , a foolish old soldier , an anatomist who knew Knox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hare , who killed the meat , lived ? Is it not strange that all over Tennessee , Mississippi , Alabama and Georgia are buried pieces of men that I hacked away from them  --  arms , legs , fingers and toes  --  even a nose and two left ears . Some I should n't have cut off . God , there are men even now living in Des Moines or Keokuk or Salina who wake up at night and think : Jesus Christ it 's funny : part of me was buried down on the banks of the Tennessee river in the Spring of 1862 . Part of me is already doornail dead , mackerel dead , beef dead , stone dead  --  bled like a stuck pig . Maybe , by God , the bones are still down there under the dirt , clean and white . My armbones and my hand bones . My meatless hand and arm that used to have such good hard muscles  --  that I was so proud and vain of . That I figgered ways to get the girls to feel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 've got a hand in Tennessee . I can remember how that saw sounded . I knew a man once that had a funeral for his arm that they cut off in the hospital and buried it with a head- or would you say an armstone . And there was that Rebel officer who had his leg taken off by a cannonball . He lay there on the stretcher bleeding despite the tourniquetwhich the surgeon-general of the whole Goddamned Confederatearmy had put on him . And he said : Here , give me my leg . This here leg 's been my friend a good many years . I stood on it a long time and now I 'm gon na stand by it . They gave him his leg and he took the poor bloody thing and hugged it to him as he lay there  --  and they carriedhim off the battlefield huggin ' it to him like it was a baby . Yes , Wagnal said , it 's a strange horrific world and while it hurts it fascinates . One considers too curiously ; one gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but of all the strange things in the world : such as how at night there are so many persons sleeping on the earth 's surface , so many two feet above it , and so many fifteen feet above it , and so many any given number of feet above it . And bullets , he said , his old eyes focussing on the dim alley of an obscure thought . Bullets : Hollywood cemetery in Richmond is full of squashed minie balls . Every cemetery in every little town in America has a minie ball in it . Bannerman 's Arsenal and Museum in New York City is full of muskets , Napoleon guns and shot-riddled logs from Spottsylvania , Chancellorsville and the Wilderness  --  and minie balls fired and unfired . And how many eyes glazed and died looking at these things ? And how did the eyes look ? What color ? What temper ? What humor ? And what had the eyes beheld in the moment before the smoke , and the ground coming up to meet them ? Was it the burning trees all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And the eyes that lived : after four years they said it was the greatest war the world had ever seen . And the eyes were flattered . They went back home to sit and think of it and think around it and carry that minie ball under the scalp or in the thigh . And every little town in America had a post of the Grand Army of the Republic or of the United Confederate Veterans . And they all wore those oldsoldier hats , blue or gray . And every little boy said : My Grandpa was in the Civil War or the War between the States ; he 's an Old Soldier . Was your Grandpa ? And the answer was : Sure , everybody 's Grandpa 's an Old Soldier . And there were two days one for the North and one for the South when the Old Soldiers marched to the cemeteries of the nation . And when there was a military post near , the commandant sent a firing-squad with breech-loading rifles or a battery of three inch breech-loading cannon . And the Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said : By Jesus , if we 'd a-had them at Gettysburg Pickett would n't a-got off Seminary Ridge . By God , if we 'd a-had them at Shiloh , Grant would a-been drownded in the Tennessee with his whole Goddamned army . You do n't have to chaw them ca'tridges . Oh , they was a few britchloadersall right , but I never seen none  --  and do n't you fergit it ! Many 's the mouthful a-powder I got a-bitin ' a minnie ca'tridge . Yes , Lee said aloud , it is strange  --  damn ' strange . He looked at the sonnets with warm , hypnotized eyes . Strange , he said , strangely . YES , Wagnal said , I went back to Mississippi early with Clint . For , standing there , that night after the banquet in the Estes house , in the street full of trees and stone hitching posts , and smelling the smell of young girlflesh , and hearing the young girlyoices and the rustle of sweetsummer clothes under the nightwind 's rustle in the leaves , and seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamplight , I longed and lusted for Katherine Theron  --  and I longed for love and loved love ; and my heart was wellnigh to bursting because it was so full of the sound of silly girls at night on a smalltown street . Quite pastoral it was and bucolic as a rustic masque , but not in a decadentway ; there were your Colins and Chloes and Strephons and Cornelias , but they were not the decadent people who had appeared in verses like bad tapestry . They walked through the summer streets with a lust that was as finetextured and elastic as their beautiful young skins  --  their young breasts and fine long thighs . The stray curling hairs around the girls ' eyes and on their Venus ' mounts and the golden freckles on their noses and the delectable curves of their throats . Sir , Wagnal said , even now in my senility , the time when a man 's passion is said all to be spent , I tell you that I can feel an ache which I can not tell now from the sweet ache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keokuk . Penis erectusp115conscientiam non habet  --  no . He has , sir . For he remembers , with senile and satyric regret , all the girls he did not meet . I stood under the whispering trees then and saw the pert face of Sleepy Bates 's primpmouthed , silly little girl , smelt her as she drifted past and her frilly clothes shook out showers of the near sicksweet lilac perfume on the warm nightair  --  and in my mind 's eye I saw each skirt and underskirt and corset and corsetcover fall to the floor one by one until she stood naked to the navel , nipples and parts before me  --  smiling and acquiescent and smelling hot as a bitch in heat  --  and ready for it . And in a moment she was not Bates 's girl , but Red Mary in Edinburgh , naked as I had seen her many times in life and finally in death as Dick Ames stood over her with the dissecting knife  --  and in the end it was Katherine Theron down in Mississippi standing , naked and inviting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stirring around her satiric little face , her nipples hard and her lips upturned and swollen for a hot kiss . I walked through the streets of Keokuk for a long time that night , for the moment 's soporific peace of the quiet street had left me . I found a woman in the Estes house  --  a broad country girl , who gave me a rather tasteless ride that finally let me sleep . I had her in my bed for three nights handrunning  --  but at the end of that week , I told Clint Belton that I would return early to the South and go to Messenger 's Ferry with him to visit the Theron girls , if he could arrange an invitation . Clint laughed at that . He reached inside the hot , officer 's frockcoat and pulled out a ragged but once fine London envelope . And , dear Colonel Belton , on your return trip to join your regiment , you must stop to see us . Please bring Lieutenant Wagnal  --  is it not Captain now ? Katherine joins me in hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be with us this summer . We took  --  rather Clint took  --  the Crimean and the drummer boy with him and crawled down to the South , though I suppose the journey was fast enough for those days . The steamboats were full of soldiers going to and from furloughs and whores following them about and sutlers and profiteers  --  and a few women going to fetch soldiers home from Southern hospitals , or what had been soldiers back to their home earth for burial . And there were delegations of longfaced old sisters from the Sanitary Commission bringing through consignments of lint and bandages . Everybody was hot on the steamboats and trains ; and the insects bumped their feelered heads against the hot oil lamps on theI16 THE HISTORY OF RnME HANKSp116walls and ceilings over the aisles . The trains screeched and chattered ; and you looked out of the dingy windows with eyes that felt as if they were lined with sandpaper to see passing flatcars full of Napoleons and howitzers and regiments of conscripts in shoddy piling into boxcars . And you could hear such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never found . Father went there and went over every inch of the battlefieldwith a finetooth comb . He even paid a man to dig up a grave , but they was too many in it  --  and you could n't of told . Yes ; Ma found him : there was a photoguffer making a picture after the battle of Shiloh . He was a-lying there with his arms all out like he was asleep  --  like he used to lay in the grass by the big tree in the front yard . Even with his eyes closed . Ma waited till the photoguffer was through , and then she said : If you please , sir , I want one of them pictures . That 's my boy  --  right there . Oh , ma'am , I 'm sorry , the picture man said . He took Ma 's name and address and said , I 'll send you one to Ohio direct I git ' em done up ma'am . No . He would n't take any pay at all . It was a long time but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was asleep under the big tree  --  fist asleep . If the dog was there in the picture , it 'd be jist like any day at home when he was a little boy . That 's what Harriet said too  --  the girl he was a-going to marry  --  jist like he was asleep , like a littlebittovaboy . Ma cut off all the other dead soldiers and burnt ' em up . Some of them was swollen so bad from the sun . She said , if they ai n't there , I can think of him asleep peaceful-like under the tree like when he was a littlebittovaboy . I remember the girl who said that after all these years  --  she was in the same coach with me for ten hours . I never spoke to her  --  but she was a beautiful whiteskinned girl in a pokebonnet . Shc looked at me once or twice , long and soft . And I loved her and strained forward in my seat to get to Mississippi the sooner . As we traveled Southward , Wagnal said , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cars . Having been on furlough , we had had our nostrils blown out with the clean air of Iowa . Now we were returned to a land where even in the open and miles from where the human hunt was going on  --  a land miles from where any shot had been fired  --  you might suddenly smell the track of war . The sweat and urine spoor of long marched-in uniforms and the foxden smell of soldiers whose very ears had begun to sharpen up to points  --  whose motions had taken on the aspects of cunning economy which one sees in carnivores.  |p117We  went by train to Corinth , Wagnal said . We thought it would be quicker  --  and Clint said he had to execute a government commission there . It was a government commission all right : It was to deliver a pass to get some cotton through the lines to a New England mill . The cotton was bought under the name of a Belton cousin , a war departmentclerk in Washington . I found this out by chance  --  standing outsidea window of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , Crime , who was privy to the manipulation ( not by design of course , but by virtue of his sly pocket-Machiavellian nature ) dropped me a hint . For he had begun even in sixty-two to cultivate a petty hold over Clint . He began to know too much about Clint at Pittsburgh Landing , having been his wardheeler , so to speak , throughout the regiment . From that time on he continued to gather information , like a packrat ; about Clint 's actions . I believe he knew about the minutes uncle : the bluff at Shiloh . He began to know so much that Clint grew incautious about him . Well , Crime saw that this little deal in cotton was a pretty careless thing for an ambitious colonel of volunteers to be conniving at in the summer of sixty-four when he was waiting to be commissioned brigadierand he told Clint what he thought of it . Clint always listened to Crime . That was one thing about Clint : he could recognize wisdom and use it to his advantage . With twenty dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get mentioned in the dispatches  --  after the cotton has gone through and the pass destroyed . It was at Atlanta that he got that particular mention in the dispatches . I shall tell you of it presently . It was at Atlanta that he became Brigadier-General Clinton Belton ; it was at Atlanta that Rome and I found poor Sleepy Bates dead of a bullet in his back in a place where there had not yet been any fighting on both sides of the breastworks as there was in many places that day . Clint finished the business with the cotton man and came out on the veranda of the Tishomingo hotel just before dusk . Crime and the drummer boy  --  dismissed after serving dinner to Clint and his guest  --  were walking along the loose rusty rails of the Mobile &; Ohio ; a wildernessof empty porkbarrels and mealsacks lay in a jumble beside the little station across the road from the hotel ; an old negro , who had come from Africa in the late eighteenth century prodded a single scrawny ox , yoked to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribs of the beast made deep slashshadows on his sides . Above Clint and me , the wooden upperdeck of the veranda of thep118Tishomingo hotel sagged wearily . A rickety poorwhite , his barefeet gray with dust , sneaked past . The tavernkeeper , a fat man in a dirty yellow brocaded silk waistcoat , stood in the doorway fanning himself with a copy of a last year 's New York Tribune : Vicksburg Has Fall , a headline said , a tear holding the statement in suspension . That was only last year  --  only last year , the day I had first seen Katherine Theron  --  but it was an ancient newspaper , ancient as some hieroglyphics in a tomb at Gizeh . And even then  --  that was back in sixty-four , boy , Wagnalsaid in a fiercedeep voice  --  the damned Tishomingo hotel was old , then the town was dying , a town that was grandiosely named , by some pompous men in shabby frockcoats with a little classical-romantic learning , after an old Greek city rapacious and cunning and , but for seven broken Doric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corinth , Mississippi , Wagnal said , his voice deepening and quietening Athens , Corinth , Thebes , and a thousand other little towns in the South named out of Classical Literature . And tens of thousands of Greek columns holding up the wooden pediments of the great verandas of the South  --  all beginning to decay before the Yankees came , many never quite finishedbut good enough for the stage set that the Southern Gentleman had built for his charades . But perhaps , I said to Wagnal , Corinth of the huge rock , Corinthon-the-Isthmuswas the same . Maybe it was a sorry pushing place that aped another city which lived white and beautiful only in the minds of those men who dragged their ships from one sea to another complainingthat the currants were not good this year and the wine would be sour as the new crop of girls around the temple . Ah yes , Wagnal said , I was forgetting . Of course , sir , Corinth , Athens , Thebes , exist , odorlessand white and cool with a gentle breeze blowing through them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain . But there even the beggars are picturesque  --  and the slaves and whores exist only to complete a rich picture . The very vices themselves are colors for the artist . The odors , the lepers , the halt and blind , the defective sewers , the brothels , the slavemarket , the hot days , the insects , the masters , the cheats and the cheated are all no more than a flat picture on a well-lighted wall  --  a fume on the mind . Corinth , a great , rich , commercial city of ancient Greece  --  Corinth , a little town in Mississippi , which would have been nothing more than a flyspeck on the map of North America , had not General Albert Sidney Johnston rounded up an armed rabble there in 1862 and marched them over to Pittsburghp119Landing in the mud , is again nothing more than a flyspeck . For who knows anything about either Corinth now ? A few fusty theologians , pedantic classicists , and historians who sweep the years into the general dustpan . Mummies , dust , spinsterskin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek Companions cancelled out by a night in a Kansas City whorehouse , a tribute to the courage of a Texan , drunk with something or other , who rode up to a redhot wellfought battery and did not live to tell us how it was in the muzzleblast  --  except through the photograph in which he lay unburied and goggling at the sky . They stole his boots  --  for surely a colonel , at that stage of the war , had boots  --  and buried him with full military honors so that a regiment might be paraded before a general . The fat , yellowvested tavernkeeper fanned himself with Vicksburg Has Fall  --  And Clint said : Let us go on tonight  --  tomorrow  --  as soon as there is a train . But we rode horses . It took two weeks or more to get down through the shabby country to Messenger 's Ferry . We rode a good many different decrepit nags , ate sidemeat and cornpone , and , once , some collard greens in a negro cabin smaller than this . As we drew deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the eye . I kept thinking that it was all miasma and mystery . I saw , in weathered fence-corners , the ruins of mills and houses , the deadened trees , a sloven shiftless evil . Under the rich ground I thought I could hear the larvae of a million eyeless hookworms massing for attack . And though I saw but a few , my mind was full of sinister serpent-infested bayous and secret mosshungswamps . Every time we passed a big house , I looked at it as if it would draw the eyeballs from my head , asking myself : How did that place come to be here ? Why , in the name of God , all those toplofty columns ? To impress the neighbors , or the negroes , or God ? When we came to the road which had first led us past the Theron house , Clint and I did not recognize it . Crime said : Would the colonel , sir , and the surgeon , sir , like a bit of a brushup before presenting themselves to the ladies , sir ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the moss on the live oaks was thicker and the weeds on the roadside  --  and , this time , the luxuriance of the trees concealed the house almost entirely . Crime and the drummer boy started to brush Clint 's clothes , but Clint  --  he was sometimes extraordinarily sensitive in matters which touched his vanity  --  said sharply : Captain Wagnal first ! Yes , sir , the Crimean said grinning.  |p120Crime  brushed my clothes and hat and the drummer boy , pouting his redlips like the girls I had seen in Keokuk , knelt to my boots . I did not again forget to use my handkerchief . The gates creaked a little more than before and the wall and lodge were nearly buried under vines . Our horses ' shoes crunched on the weedgrown gravel . It was early afternoon , but it was almost dark  --  and more clammy than before  --  in the park . I could see none of the garden statuary . When we came into the semicircular sweep of the drive , we were blinded momentarily by the sun on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height of the columns which stood glowing pinkly  --  and felt the warmth fall gratefully on my dampcold hands and cheeks after the dark mossraked ride . If the father 's here , Clint said , we must take him . Take him ? I said . Yes , he 's a blockader . He has a base in Nassau . But  --  I said . I 'll include your name in the dispatch , Clint said . I 'd rather you would n't , I said . Oh , very well , Clint said . We heard the horse ; and Clint took his Colt 's from the holster and cocked it . Katherine came riding Percy around the side of the verandah . She had on a black silk habit with ostrich plumes in her hat . She laughed , looking at Clint with a luminous , sardonic expression . He put the Colt 's away and took off his hat . How extremely pleasant to see you , Captain , Katherine said  --  and you , Colonel . Percy 's in fine fettle since you attended him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take you up to your rooms . My sister is occupied trying on the things my father brought her from Paris . I trust we shall meet your father , Miss Theron , Clint said . I 've no doubt you will , Colonel . She had no need to call Rass , for he had opened the front door and was standing in it with a cocked and primed musket in his hands . Put that down , Rass , and fetch these gentlemen to their rooms . See them bathed and made comfortable . And these , she said , looking at Crime and the drummer boy , put them in the quarters . The quarters , Miss ? You heard my instructions Rasselas ! Rasselas ? Clint said . The Prince of Abyssinia  --  Dr. Johnson . My great grandfather knew the insufferableold pedant well , Katherine said . They used to lounge in the gate at Pembroke and slide in Christ Church meadow . Christ Church meadow ? Clint said . Meadow , Katherine said . Oxford . Oh , yes , Clint said blushing . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he so cholerically threw down the towerstairs at Pembroke . And , Katherinesaid , my father is a very cold and calculating man and not a littlep121bloody . He has not , shall I say , the warm heart which led my grandfatherinto the bravado of duels over women . He is not as interesting as my grandfather was , but he is logical and ruthless . My dear child , Clint said . My good man , Katherine said , do not patronize me in that politic tone . I know it too well from the politicians my grandfather used to bring here for his amusement . They used to quote him Latin tags  --  and quite incorrectly  --  , praise his worst brandy and tell him they knew a gentleman and a judge of good liquor when they saw one . What spunk ! What fiah ! they said when I objected to their chucking me under the chin  --  when I would not play Lydia Languish for them . Why , suh , the little lady 's a veritable Amazon ! Ah , Clint said . I beg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could see the cold glitter in those eyes of Mars that the replacement boy who came out to the regiment too late had described . Clint never had any love for Katherine Theron . Granted , Colonel , Katherine said smiling . I think you will get on with my father who preserves a certain highflown manner to disguise his cold acquisitiveness . And it will interest you much to know that my dear sister , Una , has found in you , sir , her beau ideal , and the passion of her life . I see all the signs . Clint was red in the face . The horses , sir ? the Crimean said to him . Around the house , Katherine said . You 'll see the stables . Take Percy too  --  the open box stall . Yes , Miss , Crime said , almost grinning while the drummer boy pouted . Thank you , Miss . Rass , Katherine said , show the gentlemen up to their rooms . Take the colonel , Rass , I said . I can find my own way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You will have to wash your magnificent beard . It 's quite like a statue of Zeus in that dust  --  like marble . How have you been ? What was the Iowa Territorylike ? And how many rustic maidens did you charm ? Yet perhaps , Wagnal said , that was not what Katherine said . Perhapsshe said nothing except with a warm look from underneath the hair which was like dark violets around her face . Mind , sir , I do not wish to picture for you something that was not a woman  --  something that never lived except in the lines of some self-styled poet who hewed to his own form . I tell you she was standing there in the hot enervating sunlight of a Mississippi afternoon of 1864 . I could see her breathing and examine closely the fine white texture of her skin  --  and see the moist red membranes of her lips cling and part over the words she said or did not say . And I could smell the lavender she had scented herself with . And I knew that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thep122black silk riding-habit , I should feel a warm solid flexible woman within , sensual and wayward and yet fastidious . Katherine , I think , reminded me of Sappho . Perhaps because I could then and now always close my eyes and see her walking at dusk in a cool island grove  --  always young and sensual and wearing saffron and purple . No , not always , for perhaps it was later that I conceived her thus . Then , in 1863 and 1864 , my life  --  my mind was a collection of things without focus : Everything from Dick Ames singing in an Edinburgh pothouse to the Crimean handing me the young Rebel 's head on the field at Shiloh  --  or my love for your great-grandfather , Romulus Lycurgus Hanks . And how was it possible to think then , confronted by the dust and mud of the roads , the miasma of the swamps , the sweet putrefactive odors of dead soldiermeat , horsemeat and mulemeat  --  and a thousand other phenomena which accompany the process of a gravitation of power ? In all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Shiloh and Vicksburg and Atlanta , there was little time but for frantic concentration : a fascinated beating-off of death , a rapt rush into his arms , a cunning wriggle through his bloodslippery fingers . Always in such extremities there must be concentration : the gun , the sword , the dirk , the poison must be brought to bear hard upon the seat of life  --  life itself must bear hard and strain upon the blade , the wound , the venom to die . Be still . Let me die ! Without war , a man must concentrate for seventy years to die  --  and sometimes . when his blood runs high , he can not die sooner with war . Whose fools are we , sir ? Wagnal said , picking up the whiskey bottle again . Bacchus 's ? Fortune 's ? Venus 's ? He poured the communion cups full again . Society 's ? Jesus of Nazareth 's ? St. Mary the Virgin 's ? Islam 's ? Well , sir , of the infinite variety , I should prefer to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I fear I am not . I fear that I am the fool of an infinite impractical joke with little humor and less wit . My God ! Me , down in Tennessee sweating in a dirty blue coat , not because I had any convictions , any hatred , or even any political ambition , but because of the vanity of a little goldbraid which soon tarnished and a few yards of cloth which soon grew ragged and foul-smelling . And Clint Belton . Well , Clint knew what he was doing . His one spontaneous act during the War Between the States  --  perhaps during his whole life  --  was his crawl to shelter under the bluff at Pittsburgh Landing.  |p123GOD  forgive me , Wagnal said , I have always loved women for their most whorish artfulness . I am wooed by lipsalve and cunning hairdress , the soft folds of silk which cover them and the artificial scents with which they anoint their fair tight young skins . I like them to be a fair blaze of passionate color both in flesh and mind ; I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes sliding free against the smooth skin which is made to touch and hold and feel . None of your milky pastel maidens for me  --  none of your twitterers . No , nor none of your exuberantcountry goochers . I like them to be of bright color and unabashed  --  to know what they are doing when they lie down with you . I like them to be cool and crisp with the latent fire shining roselike from the skin  --  I like them to be everything the Greeks said their most famous courtesans were  --  which they were most probably not . But nevertheless , young man , Katherine was all these things to me . And I might have had her then , in the summer of sixty-four , not for the asking , but the bare taking . And I am sorry that the taking was not in me then . Now , I would take all of Katherine I could get . For , as I have said , she was no Southern Lady , to contract carefully for her mawkish bed and drive her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in Mississippi in Eighteen hundred and sixty-four sounds dubious  --  but she was true . Oh , for that matter , the whole family was incredible enough , and , with the exception of Katherine , not a tribe to have around  --  but you shall see presently . Though it will wreck the sculpture , Katherine said , you must wash your fine beard , Captain . Her face crinkled up around her small eyes , and again she seemed in a silent paroxysm of great godlike laughter . Then come down to me and I will give you some sherry  --  and , if it 's light enough , I 'll show you around the grounds . I can see her now , standing there under that tall falsegreek portico , her eyes in amused slits , her dimples up  --  Wagnal paused now looking back with a diffuse look in the old bloodshot eyes . He picked up the communion goblet and gulped the whiskey in a great pachydermatous gulp , a tear splashinghis pale hairbacked hand as he did so . He flicked the tearwet hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already plummeted down his gullet , but the old particular lump in his throat which GodpI24 had been making him swallow for those many years . Katherine , he said . Oh , Katherine ! Everything was as it had been in the upstairs sitting-room , except that there was a pile of new leatherbound books on the floor , and , on the chairs sheaves of magazines : Copies of Blackwood 's , The London Illustrated News , Punch . I flipped through several numbers of Punch and saw Mr. Lincoln 's large face most grossly caricatured , before Rass came in and said : Your bath is ready , sir . Before I bathed , I sat again in the cordovan seat of the porcelain watercloset . The Cellini ewer , the statuette of Cloacina , the Japanese paper were still there . A new book about Paris by Taine and Grain d'Orge lay on the shelf beside the blazoned stoolbowl ; and , if I had not been so excited and unstrung over the proximity of Katherine , I should have thoroughly enjoyed my latrine duty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was of a piece with the closetbowl , though there were more and larger griffons , lions and crocodiles on it . And at one end of the tiled room on a high stand , there squatted a stuffed , glasseyed crocodile , his mouth open as if he were about to amputate the tender leg of a baby . I got out , dried myself on several large , thick linen towels and went over to the stuffed reptile , looking curiously at the several rows of teeth , the fine well-cared-for state of the hide and the long heavy tail , cunningly flexed to counterfeitlife . When I had dressed , I found Clint sitting with a copy of Punch open on his knees staring at a cartoon of Mr. Lincoln and Jefferson Davis or the South playing billiards . The Southern figure was saying : Hurrah for Charleston ! That 's another one for me . The face of Mr. Lincoln was a depraved , boorish face . How , Clint said piously , can they do such things to such a great and noble gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Ah ! he said . The beautiful Katherine ! Yes , Clint , I said slowly with no levity in my voice , the beautiful Katherine . As you can still see , sir , I am a big man . And as you have perhaps heard through village gossip , that I am a crazy hotheaded fool . It is known here that I am insane , is it not ? If it were not that I am such a Character , I should be sent to an institution  --  though they do not love me as they did Daft Jamie . Is that not the size of it ? His eyes blazed coldly through the rivermaps of red veins . You do not need to deny it , sir ! Speak up ! Let us not have this thrice Goddamned village nonsense between us . We are not a pair of superstitious smalltown wiseacres . WepI25are men of the world . You are sitting there in a wellcut suit from Jermyn street . Speak up ! Then suddenly the cold light left his eyes and the wattles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered . I beg your pardon , sir , he said . That I should embarrass you so in my own house ! Do not reply . That I have unpacked my heart to you as I have done must be proof enough that I regard you in the light of a man of understanding . I wished only to point my remark to Clint , to say that in those days I was a bigger and more impetuous man than I am now . It took me a long time to realize how dangerous I was considered to be . But I was not thought insane then , for I was still young . But for all my impetuosity , I did not take Katherine that summer in Mississippi  --  Katherine who was ripe , on the topmost bough , for the taking . She had on a new blue silk dress and , with the lavender , some other perfume . She was standing in a sunshaft at the foot of the big staircase , looking up . As I rounded the curve , I could see that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , when I had turned , I saw that she was not smiling  --  and the dimples were gone and her slit eyes were wideopen and there was a straight frownfurrow between them . As God is my judge , Captain , she said , I am sick to death of this place . It is dead . It seems to me that all over the world  --  everywhere but here  --  things are happening . Since Grandfather was killed there is nothing to look forward to . A negro came in the front door last night . He was about to tear down one of those tapestries in the Louis Quatorze room when Rass picked him up and threw him out the back door . Rass would have killed him if I had n't been near . Aside from that there 's been no excitement . The battles always give this place a wide berth  --  You would not like battles , I said . They are cruel and dirty and you can not see much . You could not see the flag waving and the men clashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the blood is a dirtier color than in the paintings . But , Katherine said , the wideopen sliteyes burning , battle is dangerous  --  you know you are alive . It has got so , even when I take a high fence with Percy , I do not know I am alive . I believe I could shoot the enemy for sport . I saw now that her darkblue eyepupils were dilated . I had as leave take one of Grandfather 's guns and take my chances in battle as die because I do not know I am alive . I could shoot for sport  --  I know I could shoot down that gambler in Vicksburg without a qualm . I should love to see a redspot growp126on his white fussy shirt and see his eyes roll upward with that silly sanctimonious look a dead man gets . I do not know what I shall ever do . I was so distracted by this cold bloody passion of Katherine 's , that , to take her mind from the morbidity of such things , I said : That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know there was a zoologist in your household . Zoologist ! Katherine said . My grandfather used to shoot them because of the funny way they pirouetted and whirled and jumped high in the air when the bullet penetrated their eyes . He used to say that they had more ballon than all the prima ballerinas in St. Petersburg  --  and were a damned sight more graceful . He called the one in your bathroom Tamara , for he said she reminded him of a fine ballet wench who used to cross herself as she pirouetted before every entrance she made and who ran away with him to London pursued by a whole regiment of Imperial Guard 's officers . When he shot the beast , he said , it jumped exactly like Tamara  --  the same grand lugubrious , lovable , flatfooted style that threw all the Tsar 's young men into very ecstasies of love and yearning . He always kept Tamara the crocodile in the bathroom so that she would remind him of his ballerina as he lolled in the water like a Roman . I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered her up  --  not through any delicacy for your feelings  --  only because he had the notion that vulgar eyes must not look upon Grandfather'slove . Now , I believe he has ceased to regard your gaze as vulgar . Yes , Katherine said . Grandfather loved Tamara , the crocodile . He said the movements of her tail were very fantastic after the bullet hit her  --  endearingly comical . They grew more comical and endearing each time he described her deathdance . He added an extra pigeonwing each time he told it . It was he who added her to the griffons and lions . Are there crocodiles near here ? I said . Not such splendid ones , Grandfather thought . That was when we used to go to New Orleans . One year I made Rass get me a peek into the quadroon ball  --  and they were lovely . Grandfather shot Tamara in the big bayou near Lake Pontchartrain . There was a young man in New Orleans who amused him  --  an oaf named Jabez something , whom he used to foist upon my sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and her dimples came up  --  and with whom he had a crocodile-hunting friendship . The same day Grandfather shot Tamara , Jabez shot one he named Parson Judas . Colonel , jabez said , see that gentleman gaping over there under the cane branch ? Looks like Parson Judas from Kentucky thatp127came psalm-singin ' to Ma 's last week . Same jaws  --  same white waistcoat ! Here 's for the white weskit ! The parson ai n't decent from the way he exposes his belly . I beg your pardon , Reverend . I fear I 've spotted your white waistcoast . Grandfather used to tell it well , Katherine said . He was a fine mimic and could get the same unpleasant expression into his eyes that Jabez had . He could almost make his cheeks bulge and redden and his nostrils swell like Jabez ' . Grandfather pretended to like him , but I do n't think he did . The oaf was as tall as you , Captain , but his frame was covered with solid , motionless flesh like a stunned bull 's  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no one cared to go near him . He used to rush drunkenly out of a pub on a stormy night . I am not a dog to stay indoors and sleep on straw , he would holler . One night he walked to the riverside and got into his boat and steered out into the river where big treetrunks were rushing down swept by the mad water . Grandfather said he was magnificent  --  oh , magnificent , steering his boat , in lightning flashes , with the strength of Hercules . Nobody thought he would ever return , but he came back in the morning , fresh and good-humored as if he had been a great deepsea beast . He had been to the Mexican war too : one day he just left his stuffy English  --  well , not so stuffy , for there were a lot of Creole things in it  --  house , going on horseback , with carbines , pistols , hounds and a compass , straight through the woods . He came back after six months . People said that there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and killed at least a company of Mexicans and several Indians . His hounds foraged for themselves in the woods  --  and they were so savage when they came home with him that he had to shoot them . Oh , he was popular enough . All the rich young men of New Orleans idolized him because of his daring . And Una , well , the only reason that Una did not encourage him more was because he was not likely to make her a duchess or a princess or install her in the White House . I believe she secretly thought him quite dashing , for his mother was a French Marquise from an old family . The Marquise had had him educated as well as possible and brought him up in the manners of the ancient noblesse . You know , Captain , that in the Creole society , Yankees pass as impudent tradesmen  --  mere grocers . But Jabez  --  oh , he was the cynosure of all eyes  --  had a fine carriage and fine horses , a parcel of smart well-whipped ' negroes and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . The shopwomen thought he was a very devil , but I 've no doubt they would have smiled on him fast enough had he given them the chance . Once when Grandfather and I were stopping in New Orleans before the war , Grandfather and he went to a barroom . It was an awful day  --  so hot that several men and horses had fallen sunstruck in the streets . And the mosquitoes came up in clouds from the river . A heavy miasmal breeze came up towards evening , just before he and Jabez went into the barroom . Jabez had been bitten by a good many mosquitoes and was morose and sulky  --  besides he had caught his quadroon with an Irish dock laborer whom he had beaten with a crop while standing off a dozen of the man 's friends with a pistol . Jabez yelled arrogantly for a glass of rum and drank it with a grimace . Some gimleteyed old customers were standing up to the bar shifting their tobacco quids , picking their teeth with their knives and staring at the elegant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at them as if they were vermin . Grandfather , who had a morbid love for such situations , said that the air was full of feeling running high , and that any moment he expected something to stir the sluggish blood . The gimleteyed customers he thought to have been Kentuckians , of the more rough and ready fire-eating type , in New Orleans to sell their cotton and tobacco and get drunk and enjoy the town 's large supply of vari-colored women  --  half-castes , quadroons , et cetera , Grandfathersaid . But the high moment , as Grandfather often called it since , came in a guise he had not foreseen . It seems , in that bar , Jabez had a favorite waiter , who was busy serving the gimleteyes . A match ! Jabez said . But the waiter went on shoving sandwiches across the bar to the Kentuckians . Jabez called him three times , each time his voice growing more hoarse and his face getting more purple . The waiter , poor wretch , was beset on all sides . The Kentuckians were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trousers to take their due service from them ; and Jabez , who regarded this waiter almost  --  though the man was white , or at least half-caste  --  as one of his own bought-and-paid-for negroes , was near to bursting not one , but all his blood vessels . The heat , the mosquitoes , the miasmal breeze , the uncouth Kentuckians ( no better than poor white trash ) and then this disloyalty of an old servant  --  the last straw had fallen . The waiter , afraid , kept saying : Right away , sir . He fearfully gave the Kentuckians their last sandwich and ran past Jabez for the match . Jabez , with a mesmerized look on his bovine face , pulled out his bowie knife and stabbed the waiter so hard in the back thatp129Grandfather heard the spine crack . The man fell on his face choking . He raised himself on his elbows and got out the words , right away , as he stretched out his neck to catch the air . He hiccoughed , vomited gouts of blood and died . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody , including the gimleteyed customers , stared at it without moving from their places . Jabez also stared  --  he stared as if he were in a trance until someone brought a policeman . And then , morose and docile , he went away with the policeman . All New Orleans began to talk . I heard a negro say : Well , Young Massa call de po ' white fo ' time . He don ' come . Young Massa got a right to sen ' him to de rewand . Dat 's whut de book say . The young fellows who idolized Jabez for his spectacular feats of bravado thought that he ought to have caned the waiter  --  with a cane the fellow should have had a couple of dozen blows . He should not have been honored with the knife  --  and the knife made it awkward . Jabez would have to go to Europe for a couple of years  --  and they would miss his society . The Irish dockhands and the shopkeepers held meetings and quoted Thomas Jefferson and swore to stop the aristocracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't hanged by law , they 'd hang him themselves . The dockhands began by cracking a gentleman 's head or two . Grandfather forbade me to leave the hotel , but I saw one or two of the brawls . For he would leave me alone , not being able to stay off the streets when there was such a chance to view some dramatic bloodshed . The judge in the case was an old French sea captain , who , Grandfathersaid , was too bloody honorable . He confused the law with God and God with power , not understanding , Grandfather said , that money was the only power . Though the judge did not love the lower classes , he said that he would show no partiality . All murderers were for the gallows  --  and he would follow the verdict of the jury . He was poor , but when a friend of Jabez called on him one morning with a packet of $50,000 in greenbacks , he pitched him downstairs into the street . Grandfather , in spite of the barbarous heat , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He told the judge that he was trifling with his own life , but the judge only went about armed to the teeth under a bodyguard of five faithful negroes . Once the judge got a carbine ball in the shoulder ; another time he was cut across thep130ribs with a bowie knife . The only reason he survived for the trial was every laborer , poorwhite , dockhand and shopkeeper in the town made it his business to protect him . Several young aristocrats were sniped to death in the streets and a pair of the judge 's negroes was found strung to a tree , badly roasted . Grandfather would not tell me all the things that happened to the people in that fracas . The trial came off , but Grandfather , though he went himself , would not let me go . Jabez would not speak . Grandfather said he acted as if he were a bull  --  a haughty , morose bull . They tried to prove he was drunk , but two dozen witnesses knew he had had but one glass of rum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him up ! He 's a Goddamned mad dog ! It was a jury of shopkeepers and blacksmiths who thought that murders were bad for business . They brought in a verdict of guilty soon enough  --  and the judge put on the black cap for hanging . The fashionable young men were up in arms : they held councils . Hanging was fit for only Yankees and negroes ! Jabez ' mother put two hundred thousand dollars  --  all the family fortune  --  under the jailer 's nose . He took his big family bible and spent the night reading it and praying  --  in the morning , with a pale pious face , he refused the money . Laborers , singing as they worked , were already digging holes for the gallowsbeams , when a couple of hundred young aristocrats with carbines attacked the jail . A colonel and his regiment , who had been set to guard the jail , were conveniently inspecting Lake Pontchartrain . True , they had left twenty soldiers but these knew the better part of valor . The aristocrats brought files , axes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great jail door . But it was too strong  --  or the dandies were not strong enough . They had to pile logs against it and set them afire . This worked , but the battering-ram and the flames had warned the Irish dockhands . They came up from the river flourishing crowbarsand pickaxes and knives  --  they wanted to see the Englishman hang . It was early morning , Grandfather said , and the Paddies had all had their whiskey . The aristocrats fired into the mob and brought down several  --  but the Irish closed in with their bowie knives . Jabez ' friends ran  --  those who could. , I sneaked out of the hotel and saw part of this from a carriage . During the next week the fashionable young gentlemen began to appear in the streets furtively with bandaged heads . There was onep131fashionable funeral  --  for a young man who died in a fall from a hunter . Grandfather said a man with a telescope had watched Jabez pacing about in his cell , his mouth open , his eyes staring as if he were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the town were a little drunker than usual during that week  --  and there were many shots at night and in the early morning . Grandfather fought a duel with a man because he had said that he could hardly blame the laborers and shopkeepers for wishing to see Jabez decorating a gibbet  --  but he shot him only in the shoulder . Oh , Grandfather often said that he considered the duello a childish practice , but , since he wished to be feared , he had to do a certain amount of wounding and killing . That is the reason I can not understand why he was so careless in Vicksburg . But I must finish the story of his companion crocodile hunter . Jabez had one day left when his mother got permission to see him . She came to the jail in a carriage bringing another woman who was heavily veiled . She gave out that the veiled woman was Jabez ' cousin of Natchez , whom the archbishop had given a special dispensation to marry him . The two women stayed in the jail an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over with grief and looked very queer . On the day of the hanging , the jailer and Jabez ' quadroon mistress were discovered in the jailer 's apartment . The pious jailer was dead drunk  --  and the quadroon was mother-naked . His clothes  --  including the elegant white trousers , now very dirty  --  in which he had stabbed the waiter , lay in disorder on the floor of Jabez ' cell . They locked the quadroon and the jailer up in separate cells . Many versions of how Jabez escaped spread over the town like wildfire . The Irish and the shopkeepers and the poorwhites all combined now . This time they had carbines . They howled for the blood of the jailer and Jabez ' nigger winch , as they called the quadroon . They went to abez ' mother 's house , but she was gone  --  only two old negroes were left . These were soon hanged , shot and burned . Then the mob went to the jail . The regiment had gone , for there was no reason to guard a jailer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , no guards and no young men of fashion to interfere , so they had little trouble in bringing out the quadroon  --  still stark naked  --  and the jailer , more white and pious than ever with remorse and fear . They took them near a bayou  --  and when as many of the shopkeepers , dockhandsand poorwhites as craved had done what they wished with the quadroon  --  they stripped the jailer and tied him to the wench in a position which I leave you to guess , my dear captain  --  and hanged them with one rope . They came back to town singing righteously with parts of the jailer swinging on the pickaxe of a Paddy . Nothing was ever done to them . For no one cared about the pious jailer , except his wife , who did not dare open her mouth because of a bourgeois shame for his action &; with the quadroon . And no one brought up the subject of the quadroon , though " suppose many who had enjoyed her favors  --  Grandfather , the fashionable young men , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the lynchers  --  must have had their moments of regret , for she was a beautiful golden wench who was really made for lechery , Grandfather said . In any event , the honorable judge shortly died of blood poisoning from one of his wounds and the whole thing blew over . Lately , I have heard stories , about Jabez ' exploits in the war . He is supposed to have run a gun , by hand , up to a Union tent at Shiloh in the early morning of April sixth and fired the first shot of the battle point blank into half a dozen sleeping Yankees , of a Kentucky regiment , blowing them to little bit : and so terrorizing their camp that he took it singlehanded while many ran to hide under the bluff ; he is supposed to have killed , with a bowie knife , the man who shot General Albert Sidney Johnston ; and he is thought to be the Andre du Bois of the New Orleans Washingtonartillery whose bravery is talked about by all the Creoles and who has been mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the other crocodile , is here , Katherine said . Would you like to see it ? I did not ask to see the other crocodile , Wagnal said . When she finished the tale , we were walking along a grassf ringed gravel path in the park and had come to the little Greek temple of a summer house , the stones of which already appeared as old as some I had seen in Athens and Crete . Beside the temple stood one of the little statues  --  perhaps of Venus  --  with the little mat of moss on its coons veneris One of Grandfather 's embarrassing little jokes , Katherine said . The moss . He delighted to shock middleclass morals . I am never embar rassed  --  and Una is such a cold creature that she can ignore it without blushing . Look , she said , the little temple was built as a ruin  --  and than grass growing up there among the figures on the pediment was care/fully planted . It 's a temple of Venus . Grandfather told me he wished he could surround @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goddess as they did in the old days of Greece . I stood still , looking at Katherine , who again , in the soft light of the park looked as if she were in the throes of that silent paroxysm of laughter . I must have been blushing , for I had been put off my stride by this girl who said such lewd words to a man . Even though I had had to do with a good many trollops of all descriptions , especially in my student days , I did not expect such realism from one who was supposed to be a lady  --  at least in America . In England , I had heard of a lewd young duchess who went naked in her garden and who was thought a dashing and wicked eccentric , but to hear Katherine Theron talk so in Mississippi in that time was startling . And , sir , Wagnal said , his voice dripping sibilantly as the outworn lechery of his youth came back to him , it was not only that it was aphrodisiac  --  it was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was so paralyzed by what her actions and speech slid to me that I could not move to seize her . She walked into the summerhouse temple of Venus with a look of invitation on her face  --  she told me , years afterwards , that it was calculated . But I stood rooted to the ground , perhaps because of awe before her youth , perhaps because I knew no precedent for this girl who spoke , with unashamed calmness , words which , if they had come from the mouth of a young man to strike the ears of almost any Southern Young Lady , would have sent her father and brothers  --  indeed the whole countryside of Southern Knighthood  --  howling down upon the slayer with visiting cards . And there would have been no rest until the blot upon Fair Womanhood had been washed out in blood  --  a process which , I have no doubt , was enjoyed to the dregs by Southern Young Womanhood while watching her honor defended . It was a species of sexual cruelty which ladies could comfortably enjoy ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guts of many a fine Daughter of the Old South to give her a sense of importance perhaps a little beyond that of being born a viscountess . But it pleased Katherine little . I think she enjoyed bloodshed but little , no matter how solemn and courteous and formal it was . But , as I said , I stood still awkwardly , paralyzed by desire and love when sh . ran into the temple . When I was able to move and speak , I said a most regrettable thing : Have you marked your grandfather 's grave ? I remember the night  --  Her eyes opened widely , the slits disappearing slowly . She seemed to be looking at me in amazement as the straight , vexed frownline appeared . Grandfather'sgrave ? she said . We were n't talking of graves , Captain  --  not that fart of beds ! She ran out of the summerhouse , her blue dress flashing in the dark green park , her dark head brushing aside the lowest trailers of moss . When I was alone , the temple and the statue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feeling of gayety that it had had  --  I knew then  --  while she was there . The temple , the statue , the manner in which they had been , so to speak , antiqued  --  now that I knew became distasteful to me . The musky smell of life , the insects winging the dark air and a little snake  --  whose licking tongue and beady eye caught my eye  --  squirming down the pediment of the summerhouse temple of Venus all conspired to make me feel as if I were a guest in a poisoned wood where all life was evil  --  where I myself had recentlydesigned to join forces with evil and got nothing for it but guilt . I am an awkward ghoul , I said aloud to myself . Here was the moment which I came away from that pleasant nightstreet of girls in Iowa  --  in a little town with clean trees  --  to catch . Here was the empty vision which drove me a thousand miles in a wartime summer , almost filled and alive . Here was the incarnation of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked through the park on the little blurry paths brushing the moss with my head , seeing here a mossy minotaur , there a greengray satyr leering out of the swampgrass at me . Turning a little curve in the path I came upon the place where Rass had dug the grave that night in eighteen sixty-three when I helped put old Theron in the Elizabethan . press . The mound had sunken ; and moss had started to creep greenly across the damp reddish soil . The grave was marked with a little phallic obelisk of red granite which looked to me ancient and Egyptian . There were ponderous box-shaped tombs or sarcophagi , weathered and cracked , some of them inscribed in academic Latin . And over all there was the smell of old death . One sarcophagus was of the mediaeval type which one sees in English abbeys : lying on top of it was the lifesize image in staring stone  --  with the eyes closed  --  figure of a man in armor with a long sword girded on , a casque in the crook of his left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head pillowed on a lion couchant . Aethelstanus Theronus : MDCCLX  --  MDCCCLII , his tomb read pompously . Beside it was another more flamboyant tomb ,  |p135|probably  rococo Italian in style , with the stone figure of a woman  --  hands clasped in prayer  --  in long flowing robes lying upon it : Marie Chatelaine , I. H. S. , In Pace Requiescat  --  no dates . I looked at the stone face of the woman in the growing dusk , remembering the portraitof the beautiful quadroon in the Louis Quatorze drawing room . Around these tombs were four small graves decorated with the neglected remnants f glass or bead flowers and wreaths : Aelfric , Odette , Francois , Toussaint . The mausoleum , another small Greek temple , had no inscription on it but a lion and a griffon . There were some other graves marked with headstones and several eroded boxtombs  --  Claudius , Elizabeth , Ovid , Pitt . Around the two sarcophagi was a wrought iron rail  --  it seemed newer than the tombs  --  with the griffon lion and crocodile device worked into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forehead clammy from the summer chill of the park and the graveyard humor . Glad to come into the sun of the gravel driveway , I was twice glad when I saw Katherine standing beside one of the columns leaning her small hand in the curve of a fluting . She was smiling as if nothing had happened  --  andtruly what had happened was one of those events of life which seem , afterwards , as if they had almost occurred , or to have occurred only as a real-seeming and vivid dream , which , one can remindoneself with recurrent relief , was unreal and , therefore , something that carries no responsibility . But I am not sure : Perhaps in this monstrous world one is responsible even for one 's dreams  --  or for nothing at all . Captain , Katherine said , I am so sorry I left you rudely . It was my own lefthandedness , Miss Theron , I said . But it was not , I am sure , she said with perfect courtesy and gaiety , which I would have exchangedfor a tantrum  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She stood looking at me with her small smile and all her bright colors  --  like the colors of the young girls who are paid , now , to pose for these color photographs . And I thought : Oh , God help me , I am lost . For I shall never be able to gobble her up , to absorb her whole , to ravish her , to bind her to my heart . And God did not help me , sir  --  and I never was . Wagnal sobbed a little  --  like distant thunder , Lee thought . And I sobbed with him . For I loved Katherine too  --  as I loved Christa and Anne and love when I was young , Christ help me . Last year I found the story of Jabez and the crocodile in Grain d'Orge.  |p136God  is the lifeboat , the insurance policy , the fire-extinguisher , the lastditch , the magnesium flare , the parachute , the trumpcard , the comforterin the sorest and uttermost need , the vaccination , the gasmask , the fortress . And He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wagnal said . And Stuart , Goddamn his foppish soul to hell , Goddamn his sanctity and his success and his plumes and his horses and his banjoman , Sweeney , and his Prussian dragoon , von Borcke and all his fire-eating heroics  --  even his deathwoundat Yellow Tavern  --  Goddamn them all to hell , Wagnal said quietly , his old voice whistling on the sibilants . He was dead and rotting away , but I 'll venture to say that a million women still prayed for him  --  still prayed his ghost into their beds before they fell asleep to dream of those plumes , that beard , and that black stallion-charger of his and his comicopera escort  --  all jackboots and horsepistols and sabres and beards and firegilt buttons going along the turnpike to the tune of Lorena on a minstrelshow banjo . And Stuart with his Goddamnedknee crossed over the saddle , singing .. . WAGNAL SAID : In a wartime summer  --  in any summer of the earth , but more in a wartime summer  --  a young man feels that he is missing something every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrow edge of the summer minute where he is perched watching the bumblebee on the wild verbena and the blue air all around it are meant to do him out of his right to see everything in the world . One young girl walking beside him in diaphanous fluffy clothes with a comic opera picturehat full of rambler roses and a little bowedup red mouth  --  walking with him near the lilac bushes and the redbud trees and the dogwood  --  can make him wish for a thousand girls , from the nakednaveled Egyptian dancers to the wellpainted , wellexercised girls of Hollywood and the debutante ad models , the sleek ghosts of Everyman'sbed , who keep their legs crossed except to the men with the big cameras and the big money . Not only girls , but all things : Katherine was there beside me , but Grant had left the Army of Tennessee . And that summer he was inp137the Wilderness racing Lee to Spottsylvania Court House . In the summertimeof Eighteen hundred and sixty-four a young man marooned in a great Mississippi plantation house  --  no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . Portentous things were transpiring . The shells set the woods on fire : men were dying roasted , trapped in the woods . Old Sedgwick was killed . They ran a battery right up to the breastworks at Spottsylvania ; the Rebels did n't put the butts of their guns to their shoulders , but reached them up , poking the barrels above their heads over the breastworks to pull the triggers so that the muskets stung their hands and almost jumped free of their grip as they went off . The barrels got so hot they could n't load  --  and it began to rain , making the guns misfire . The Yankees went crazy with enthusiasm : Some climbed to the top of the Confederate works to fire one shot down within and topple over dead . Some Rebs wanted to surrender and climbed up to the top of their works , their hands in the air , to come over to the Union line , but the shabby , bearded , starved , squittery men of the Army of Northern Virginia let them have it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dead and wounded that strengthened the works on either side . A tree , weakened by the minie balls , began cracking one night and fell on them squatting there with guns pointed at each other  --  and all floundering in the mud . In Paris a man called Charcot was tinkering with the human mind . Everything was going on in the world ; nothing was stopping until I could finish what I was doing and go see it happen , go take a part in it , go everywhere and be everything . Katherine , whose memory of a year had struck me , in Iowa , a nightblow in a spring street and brought me through a thousand miles of heat and discomfort , was near me . I ought to have brought my mind and nerves and senses to bear upon her wooing ; but even there , in the Theron house near Messenger 's Ford ( or was it Ferry ? ) , there were hooks about things that had happened faraway and longago , papers and magazines from London and Paris telling of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and objects from a score of countries and a dozen centuries . I could not be still and love , though I say to you , sir , when I detect that superior look of youth in your eye , that you are wrong : I am not , even now , different from you . I am as young and stubhorn  --  except for a certain sclerosis of tissue and thought , except for an overt appearance of the hide , which sags and flaps in the wind ,  | except for the bloodshot eyes and the dirty , careless dribblings of egg and whiskey on my shirt bosom and moustache . I am as young , sir , as you . I do not feel any different : I still desire  --  I still know the look of the rosy young flesh of a young girl . Men were young in my day , too , sir . Men were poets in my time , sir . And by the Almighty God , young fellow , they aspired to glory and knowledge and art for art 's bloody sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of you . Do not forget that , young man . We were just as dashing a set of young blades as any of you . Forgive me , Wagnal said , stopping this spate of words . Forgive me ! But you , who have already wandered a little , must already know what it is to ache and strain with love and lechery and ambition and curiosity and greed . Before dinner Katherine brought me into the library where Una , Clint and her father were drinking sherry . He was a tall , slender man with a goldenbrown hide and elegant , neatly trimmed dundreary whiskers . He had an extremely steely blue eye and a long face , somewhatlike a highbred horse or an Italian primitive . I never caught him with any expression on his face that was translatable into any word for an emotion or a humor . His smiles or frowns seemed always the conventionaltrappings for the character of his last remark  --  or the polite reaction to a remark made to him . Yet despite this blankness of physiognomy , I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was dressed in a white linen suit with a frock coat , a black cummerbund and a black silk stock  --  an outfit which he had got , perhaps , in the Bahamas , where his blockaders put in at homeport . His black boots were obviously made by a London or Paris bootmaker and elegantly varnished and polished . Howjehdo ? he said to me . Colonel Belton has threatened to seize me as contraband . I believe he has been disappointed because I have letters from Washington asking that I be protected as a subject of Her Majesteh . He smiled a coldlanguid smile , drawling out the Majesteh in a most fashionable Oxonian voice . Come , sir , Clint said , surely you see that I was only making a joke . I looked Clint straight in the eye , but his eyes did not drop , nor his expression change . The Colonel , Mr. Theron said , has innocently called me a blockader . That is understandable . Perhaps I am , in a sense . I have holdings in the Bahamas  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods to England . Naturally , this war has made my situation embarrassing.  |p139Oh  , naturally , Mr. Theron , Clint said . I understood as soon as you explained . Let us say no more about it , sir , except for the tender of my abject apologies for my crude attempt at humor , which I now see was in extremely bad taste . On the contrary , Colonel , Mr. Theron said . I found it quite amusing . Katherine , ring for Rass . We must drink to Colonel Belton 's wit . Yes , dear Father , Katherine said , her voice lightly sarcastic , her sliteyes smiling . Ah , Captain , Mr. Theron said to me , Una has told me that we are indebted to your medical skill , for the life of a fine thoroughbred horse . Are you a member of a horse regiment , sir ? No , Father , Katherine said , Captain Wagnal is a doctor of medicine of Edinburgh and a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons . Oh , but Miss  --  Do not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the more of your honors he knows , the more highly he will value you . Ah , Mr. Theron said , very fine anatomists come out of Edinburgh , I 'm told . A pity , sir , that our blackguard laws made it so extremely difficult for them to get in their  --  ah  --  subjects . Oh , yes , Father , Katherinesaid , Captain Wagnal knew the body-snatchers well , did you not , Captain ? Well , of course  --  I said . Ah yes , Mr. Theron said , picturesquebeggars , no doubt . Resurrectionists . Professional ghouls . Extremelyunpleasant creatures and an extremely unpleasant way to eke out one 's exchequer . A deal less pleasant than holdings in the Bahamas , and the Coolie trade , eh , dear Father ? Katherine said . But somewhat akin . Ah , Mr. Theron said as Rass came in , you did fetch that new Amontillado . You must try it yourself Rass  --  at your leisure  --  to see if it compares with that we had up at Balliol . Mettrefect , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Father , Katherine said , ignoring her Dither 's flight from the subject , Captain Wagnal knew the notorious Burke and Hare , who delivered absolutely fresh subjects to the anatomy schools . Captain Wagnal often knew the subjects themselves . Did you not say you knew Daft Jamie , Captain ? Really , Miss Theron , I am ashamed to think that I bothered you with the grisly tales of Edinburgh'sdissecting theatres . It is a sad business  --  Ah , Captain , Katherine said , you admit then that it is a business , and , as a business , has as much right to a place in our conversation as holdings in the Bahamas  --  and the Coolie trade . Come , Kitty dear , Una said , do not mortify the Captain because he has been so injudicious as to tell penny dreadfulstories to thrill the childish imagination . Grandfather often said ,  |p140Katherine  said blandly , still smiling with her sliteyes , that any sort of imagination was better than the absence of it . The wellbred voices dropped into a little silence in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brown light through it . He was smiling slightly . To Colonel Belton 's charming wit , he said . We sipped , and Clint bowed somewhat stiffly and said , holding up his glass , to your health . We sipped again . Mr. Theron began to talk of the last season in Paris and of the custom , in society , of staring at your fellowman , through glasses , at the Opera  --  of the custom , in America , of shying plates at the waiters at public dinners and drawing bowie knives when not served with dispatch . We spent two or three days with the Therons . All the time Clint became more and more friendly with Mr. Theron , even in that short while , picking up an English milord 's mannerism or two from our host  --  and polishing up the phrases that he had already acquired . It took little acuteness to see that he and Una had come to an understandingabout their subsequent marriage even then  --  and , I knew , from Clint 's chance remarks , the important and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katherine 's telling me that he and her father had entered into a business agreement . Now , sir , Wagnal said , those few hours in a bizarre plantation house in Mississippi were Clint Belton 's crossing of the Rubicon . His die was cast . He was bound to the course he took . The war was now a minor stepping-stone , a side issue  --  and nothing but his death , which did not come until the course was run , which I , somehow , do not believe could have come until the course was run , could have changed the course . Clint had got his lessons by heart now , he had grounded himself in all those fundamentals of life , that Rome , your grandfather , could never learn  --  and that I could grasp for a moment , but never master . Nevertheless , I left the Theron house in Mississippi that summer knowing that Katherine would come away from there with me when I was no longer a soldier , though there were no troths plighted , no banns published , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Georgia , Wagnal said . From that time on we tramped along in the dust , dropping a man or two every day . The heat put one poor , silly lad  --  a bounty boy  --  out of his head , and he began crying : Mamma ! Mamma ! I have to pee pee . The others began to call him Pee Pee Blunt . I had to send him home as a disability because it got on his nerves so badly . Rome made them let the toothless boy ride in one of the commissarywagons , for the lad was struck by the sun one day . The squitterscame back to us full force  --  and we began to get on each other 's nerves because of the bellyache . There was a lot of talk about the furlough time spent in Ioway  --  and about the girls in Keokuk and at home . The Crimean 's voice began to annoy me . Hello , Hunderd and Seventeenth , a voice would say on the road , or in camp at night  --  a voice through thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good furlough ? Oh , tollolish , tollolish ! Crime 's voice would say in a smug **60;144;TOOLONG . All the boys got to saying it until Johnston and Hood made them forget it at Kenesaw Mountain or Atlanta perhaps . God , Wagnal said , Kingston , Georgia , Acworth , Georgia , Brushy Mountain , Georgia , Jawjuh ! Jawjuh ! Jawjuh ! Kenesaw Mountain and Nickajack Creek , Turner 's Ferry and the Chattahoochee river , Marietta , Cross Keys , and all of them little , common , shaggy and still asleep even with the Yankees on their doorsteps  --  all of them shabby and asleep and wild at the same time . And all along the way those Greek columns holding up the imitation porticos . Horseshoes and worn out human shoes in the streets , a nigger padding slowly through the dust  --  but ready to run . A hound dog , a dead mule  --  but seldom even a scrawny chicken . He was not a brigadier until after the battle of Atlanta , Wagnal said , but Clint began to assume as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as he got back to the regiment . The Crimean had twelve punishment horses being ridden almost all the time while it was so hot that I have seen the strongest farmer boy keel over in t he ranks . Often I have seen two men mounted face to face on one of the tall wooden horses . Sometimes , when it was not too hot to raise spittle , they played a game of spitting at marks on the ground , for their hands were tied behind them  --  a duty which the Crimean always allowed the drummer boy to perform . The drummer boy was now a corporal ; and , since Crime picked him up at Shiloh , he had grown little taller but so much fatter that he was known as Drumbutt , behind his back . For no one dared incur the wrath of the Colonel 's inquisitor . No one wanted to ride in Belton 's Crimean Cavalry , as they named it when the new horses made their appearance . I saw one man sitting on the narrow top rail holding up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun . I gave them a drink and threw cups of water over them both when no one was looking  --  and I know Rome did as much or more  --  but that was all we could do . Oh , the company cooks and the kitchen police scoured the pots clean enough , the lines were good , the muskets clean , all the buttons sewed on and the faces straight  --  too damned straight . And strangest to me then , the men admired and respected Belton for his hardness , though they now hated the Crimean . Belton 's reputation was growing in the Army of Tennessee . Where there was abandoned cotton  --  left unburnt in hope or hurry  --  there were always men following the army to wangle passes and send the cotton back through our lines to the North where it commanded contraband prices . While Clint was serving a short turn as provost-marshal of the corps , one night a Jew ( sometimes it was an old Southern plantation owner and once I heard it was a German ) came into Belton 's tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By Jesus the general sure give it to that Jew and/or Dutchy and/or Simon Legree sonofabitch . Iss Brovust Marshal Pelton in ? He is , sir , I am that officer , sir . Veil , I couldt denk der marshal vor ein bass do go oudside die lines . What for , sir ? Ich vant to ged some goddon . Do you own the cotton , sir ? Nein ; bud tern Rebels burn id if I dond ged id . I do not give passes for such purposes , sir  --  especially to men who are too cowardly to shoulder a musket for their country at a time like this . Marshal , bier iss den tousand tollars vor ein sixdy tay bass . You damned thief and traitor , get out of here ! If you are not gone in two hours , I 'll have you shot . And , by God , the men said , the colonel taken him by the napa the neck and kicked his ass right outa the tent , where he did n't have any f  --  in ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sonofabitch since the colonel worked on him . Why ,  |p143Wagnal  said , as God is my witness , I heard that story all over again last year , from an old grayheaded man who joined the Crocker brigade in sixtythree and still draws a pension for a light case of dysentery he got cooling coffee in fence-corners . But you can see now how Clint 's star got into the ascending arc . Ile had built a reputation . The political brigadiers now sought him crawling . He sought very few men in the Army of Tennessee now , but Sherman himself . And Sherman , who preened himself a little on his wit , liked Clint well , for Clint arranged for Sherman to have said several good things which Sherman did not say . One day before Atlanta , or at Peach Tree Creek , a young aide of Sherman 's rushed up to the general , saluted and said : General Sherman , sir , two journalists have been killed in the action on our left . Clint , who was standing near knew how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have news from hell before breakfast , eh , ( ; eneral ? Sherman laughed . Clint told the story that night in Sherman'spresence to Sherman 's staff , putting the remark in the general 's mouth . After that it got down to the privates ; and Sherman heard news from hell before breakfast so much that he came to believe that he had said it . But what was more important : that remark got Clint into the general 's dispatches . It no doubt got Clint the call to speak to the New England Society and to the Reunion of the Army of Tennesseeafter the war , where the idea of Clint  --  this old friend who had sent him a box of Havanas  --  as a cabinet member must have entered the back of Grant 's head . But , Wagnal said , I do n't believe I saw much of Clint in Georgia . I spent most of my free time , up to the battle of Atlanta , with Rome  --  and , if I ever saw a man gaunt down and sadden , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , that this was his second war and that he had had a youth of strife and hardship  --  and I think that his family back in Iowa had been forced to open a dressmaker 's shop to help pay the taxes and keep themselves , though he sent them nearly all his captain 's pay  --  when he got it . I believe that one Worsham Jones , whom he had left in charge of his livery stable was stealing the receipts and running Mrs. Hanks into debt . Besides these anxieties , he had one of the worst cases of dysentery I ever treated  --  and the general tone of his health was low . So I saw him sadden on the march through Georgia . Oh , he did n't give up . Do n't ever believe , sir , that it was in Rome to give up . But the sadness grew deeper in him.  | One day he said to me , at Peach Tree Creek , I think : Thomas , the boy without the teeth came to me today and told me Clint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The boy thought it was only one shot . He said it looked as if the muzzle was pointed his way  --  and he sure heard the bullet whine . Do you think Clint is doing these things ? Can it be that Bates and that lad are touched ? Well , Rome , I said , what do you think of it ! You pulled Clint and Bates out of the mud at Pittsburgh Landing  --  and Toothless too . Yes , Rome said , but that might happen to anybody . The battle of Atlanta gave Clint Belton a fine total on the profit side of his ledger . His courage was high  --  he must have felt the luck in him that day . I am riding the crest , he said to himself . You know how that is : in a game of ball or cricket or tennis there are days when you are in fine form and fettle : when you wallop the ball you feel the good impact and you know as you swing and hit that this is a good shot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him hump to no avail . Not that it was such a victory for the Union . It was a bad fight for us , a terrible fight . But for Clint it was a personal victory . We were on the left behind some light works we had thrown up the night before . They opened with cannon about noon and pretty soon they were around behind us yelling that high Rebel screech and coming on like a bat out of hell . Oh well , Wagnal said , it seemed so . Perhaps they did n't really , for they were nearly all tired and hungry , and a good many of them were boys and old men . Why , I collared a boy who had his ma 's butcherknife lashed to the end of a broomhandle . He tried to stick it in me , but it hit my belt buckle  --  and besides it was dull as butter and he was too weak . He cried with rage when I took the broomstick away from him and made him go behind our lines . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ma with a shell . I ought to have been with the wounded all the time , but I itched then to get out in front and get myself shot . That was how I happened to see Clint , on foot , running up and down the lines behind the works hollering for everybody to hold hard and give ' em hell . He had his Colt 's revolver in one hand and his sword in the other  --  and , we 'll give the devil his due  --  he had the eye of Mars and the beard of Zeus that day all right.  |p145He  had on his buck gauntlets and he was as dusty and dirty as all the actors who played the part of the dusty courier in all the melodramasabout the War Between the States in little tank towns for years afterward . Once or twice I saw him wave his sword and take a shot at the Rebels over our heads . Sleepy Bates and the toothless boy were near me  --  and I saw Sleepy turn his head to look over his shoulder , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shouting and firing his pistol . I could see it kick in his hand . Rome was standing beside Toothless taking aim with a musket he had picked up , when Toothless started beating him on the shoulder and pointing first to Bates , who was lying bellydown with his face in the redclay parapet of the works and then to Clint who was firing over our heads again . I saw Rome frown vexedly , try to hear what Toothless had to say and turn away to aim the musket again . I saw a red spot come up on Bates 's back . When I looked up again , Clint was trotting toward another part of the line waving his sword . I think , if I recollect aright , Wagnal said , squinting his bloodshot eyes , that we had to hop over the works then , for they were coming up from the rear fast . After we got over I did n't see Rome or the Toothlessboy again during the war . I saw Bates later that day , or the next . Before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball and pulled it out from where it had lodged behind the sternum . Somebody had taken his Pa 's watch and his money  --  if he had had any . All there was left was a little soldier 's diary with a lock of black hair tied with a cherrycolored ribbon  --  maybe from the head of that pretty ovalfaced , primpmouthed girl who had walked with him at night in the quiet leafblown streets of Keokuk . Sleepy 's diary made such statements as these : Have wrote to Ma and Pa and Tessie . Sent Tessie a Reb blet buckle and Ma 22 dollars . Got a lok of Tessie 's hair and a pair nitted sox from her  --  wooll . She do n't know it 's hot down here this time of year . Ha ! Ha ! There was a Confederate shinplaster or two in the book  --  but I saw nothing of the pillage he had taken at Shiloh . I sent it all home to his mother , for there was no surname for Tessie  --  nor any address . I wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in .1 ( tion . Somebody else , I think , wrote to Toothless 's mother . But that was not all about the battle of Atlanta : Oh no . Clint be-tame a hero that day . It was late , and they were desperate . We 'd been it both sides of the works so much , I ca n't remember which side we were on when it happened . But we had plenty of muskets . Every time we beat them back , Shire Newton and Shuball York and some of the others would hop over the breastworks and pick up the good guns . There was a great lot of junk  --  flintlocks and shotguns and fowling pieces  --  amongthe arms at Atlanta . For they were hardpressed , and nearly the whole city marched out with what weapons it could find in its houses . But the boys picked up only the good ones . So we were able to have relays of guns loaded every time they hit us . I remember that line well . They were a set of the dirtiest , most forlornest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see  --  some veterans and some recruits , but all tired and dirty and fought out , screamed out , marched out , squittered out and maybe starved out . We let them have three or four volleys and they went down like tenpins . The leader  --  he turned out to be colonel of the regiment , but you could n't tell it from the getup he was wearing  --  seemed to be the only one who was shouting . He screamed right up to the edge of our breastworks and looked around . There were only six or eight men behind him  --  and they were standing stalk still , as if they were in a trance . Goddamn ' you all to hell , for a passel of cowards , he screamed back at them . Come on ! They did n't run ; they just turned around slow and walked away . The Georgia colonel was a little , old man with ratgray whiskers  --  nervous and stringy . He stood there on the parapet of our trench slashing the air with his sword  --  he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump up on the parapet and grab him by the seat of the trousers and the scruff of the neck and throw him back into the trench with us . Clint yelled : Do n't curse your men ! They 're all dead ! The Georgia colonel did n't say anything ; he could n't . He was knocked out cold . He did n't look as if he had anything to eat for a couple of days  --  and , to begin with , I doubt that he was ever fit for any sort of active duty . I noticed the sword he had in his senile hand was something like Rome 's ; and it later came out , in the various accounts of Clint 's heroism , that the colonel was a veteran of the Mexican war . Oh , yes , Clint 's capture got around : That 's the man who collared the Reb colonel barehanded , they used to say and point to Clint . He got a little scratch on his hand while he was grabbing the Georgian , and he wore the bandage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brigadier on the spot , and , as usual , when he turnedp147up the next day , the stars were shining on his shoulders where the eagles had perched . Some West Point colonel in the division resigned because of Clint 's promotion over his head . But Sherman wrote a couple of fine warmhearted references to Clint into his reports , for he remembered how Clint could appreciate a major-general 's wit . In that manner , my boy , Wagnal said , Clinton Belton began the first important leg of his political journey . Why , in a hundred books : War Tales as Recounted by Our Heroes , or Under Both Flags , or The Blue and Gray , or Tales from the Campfire which were sold by a thousand bookagents tramping the streets of all the little towns and are now turning up sadly on the shelves of cheap secondhand bookstores , you may still read how the gallant colonel of the Hundred and Seventeenth Ioway Volunteers became a brigadier at the battle of Atlanta , but few , if any , will tell you how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  died perhaps of shame and loss of heart . Wagnal 's bloodshot eyes were staring into the oil-lamp now , Lee remembered . At sometime in their lives , Wagnal said , all men meet a god . Some meet him in death and some meet him at night in dark bedroomsand some in the light of pine torches in the woods to the tune of yelling in an unknown tongue and singing and a drunken man pounding a book and some while turning a wheel with a piece of paper on it in Tibet . And they meet God because He is part of them  --  because they 've got to have Him . Because they created Him in their own image . God is the lifeboat , the insurance policy , the fire-extinguisher , the lastditch , the magnesium flare , the parachute , the trumpcard , the comforter in the sorest and uttermost need , the vaccination , the gasmask , the fortress . And He is Love . I forget , Wagnal said . I forget how it was then exactly . But take me back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbia , South Carolina and let me try to find the streets and houses and feel how it was at night , and how it was on the turnpike at noon , and how it was at dawn . Oh , I would remember , all right . I would remember why Sleepy Bates and Toothless and Rome were gone and a thousand others I had known . Rome was dead for all I knew  --  and I had to cut off Shuball York 's leg at Bentonville . And oh , there were thousands I had known or never known rotting away in the shallow graves and trenches of Georgia , Mississippi , and Tennessee . It may have been in Georgia that I first met the Christian God . John Simpson 's voice blurry with the Scot 's burr on his tongue , praying for the dead  --  calling for God to take sides in this Armageddon of the world . John Simpson was a surgeon too  --  and I thought I had the call . And indeed Abraham Lincoln was killed on a Good Friday . LEE LEFT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car to Erma Memmiger 's house in the West End , an Old English house with big new chimney pots like the little old ones on the colleges at Oxford . There were ivy vines carefully trained around the entrance and tall cedars and thicktrunked oaks in the grounds . There was an abbeylikeentrance of gray sandstone against the dark red brick . The house and grounds looked like a set of flats in a theatre . The soil around the concrete stoop , bare in the sun of a mild January day , was rocky . Downtown the air was full of gray smoke and soot ; and the light in the aisles between the buildings was as if it were tinted with a weak solution of lampblack . Here Lee squinted in the sun of this lost January day which should have come in April . Erma was yelling from upstairs about boots when the broadfaced German maid let him in . He told her he was Mr. Harrington and felt awkward as she looked at him suspiciously . Erma came downstairs  --  in ridingbreeches and boots which did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee , and took him in the drawing-room and began introducinghim to the people who were going . After that she said was n't it a beautiful day and they did n't get to use the farm much in winter and Daddy would n't do much about the farm now anyway because of the depression  --  and she heard he wrote poetry too . Yes , Lee said , is n't it a beautiful day ? What 're we waiting for ? John Sheridan said glumly . Christa , Erma said , getting up from a stool and a little wellbred annoyance in her voice . Ferris tried to pick her up , but she was n't even home . The maid said she was out doing her social work . I 'll bet she is n't even ready now . Hell ! Ferris said . She never is . Well , by God , Erma said , she 'd better hurry or we 'll leave her and let her drive out by herself.  |p149There  were the sounds of a door flying open and panting laughter . That 'll be her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm awwful sorry , but I 'm just congenitally late . Hello , everybody . The voice was almost like an English girl 's voice  --  only it was n't as set and whinnying and cutanddried . Hello , Chrissy , Erma said , smiling . Lee lifted his eyes from a pagoda in the rugpattern and got up feelingclumsy . He was about to meet the famous Christa Schell : A tall girl in a light blue basketball sweatsuit and old tennis shoes had a foot up on a Duncan Phyfe chair pulling at a sock . Goddamn ! she said . A great sheaf of bobbed hair the color of new straw with darker yellow stripes in it fell forward over her cheeks . Lee , standing awkwardly await , kept trying to think of the kind of a face that would go with the voice and hair and saying to himself that it would n't be the right kind of a face , even though he had been told that Christa Schell was beautiful . Christa tossed her head and threw the hair back a little from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do give me a cigarette . Ferris gave her one ; and she put it between her lips and allowed it to hang loosely while she pulled at the sock again . This gave her an amazing air of dash and evil . Ferris struck a match , and still pulling at the sock , she turned her head and drew the fire to the cigarette 's end . Then she gave the sock another little pull . Nuts ! she said and giving it up , stood upright , tossing the newstraw hair back off her face with a proud toss . Miss Schell , Erma said . Mr. Harrington . Perhaps something said to him then , as he looked at the face for the first time , that the end of seeing that face was a long time in the future  --  or maybe never . It was a white face ; the pink on the cheeks was scarcely there . The eyes were dark brown with a little golden mote in one of them  --  the right  --  and the lips were lipsticked dark red , following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you do , Mr. Harrington , the child 's lips said most impersonally and without question . How do you do , Miss Schell , he answered , not letting any expression come into his face at all . She inhaled the smoke of her cigarette deeply and blew out a long blue stream . Christ ! she said turning a little to Ferris as she lay back in a chair , her long legs stretched out , her body in a crumpled sprawl . Never live your life in a hurry , my lad  --  it 's no sale.  |p150Lee  turned away from her after she had turned away from him , and feeling gauche , sat on the fenderseat around a large dean fireplace which looked as if it might have been a fireplace just built and waiting for its first fire in the reign of Henry the Eighth  --  perhaps in the hall of an Oxford college . Covertly , he watched Christa , for he had never seen a girl like her in his life . Her head was not so much tilted proudly , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulders . And , even in this pride of joining , her neck and the parts of her neck which became her chin and her breast had the soft curves of a lovely child . I saw Miss Day , the producer , yesterday and tried to offer her my services for little or nothing to help her revolutionize the theatre . She said she was awwful sorry but she did n't care to revolutionize it  --  and she did n't want my services as an actress at any price . Mr. Harrington  --  Lee , Erma said , was in Wilma Day 's stock company , were n't you , Lee ? Yes , Lee said , watching the sheaf of Christa 's golden hair tumble as she turned her face toward him again . It was very amusing , he said sterilely , under the cool haughty look she gave him . Were you ? Christa said , looking away . Well , you were much more fortunate than I. Erma had gone out of the room ; and Christa left him marooned in his own silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theatre ? Yes , but I do n't seem to be able to do anything about it . She scarcely turned her head this time . For some reason that morning she had worn her haughtiest manner . Perhaps it was because she had been to Vassar , or worked on the New Nation , or had a member of the Royal Academy try to paint her back when she was fifteen , or perhaps she thought she was desperate . Well , this was the first time I 'd been on the professional stage wher I acted with Miss Day , Lee said . Really ? Yes , I just happened to get the jobChrista was not listening : Ferris and the girl named Elsie were talking to her about names Lee had never heard . Hell , he thought , she can one which he could never escape was her head laid back on the seat of the coupe . Whenp151she found out he " had been up at Oxford , " she invited him to dinner at her house . He had promised himself that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snub , but he forgot that promise quick enough . And he never could escape seeing her head laid back in the coupe . It was March at night in the midblock darkness of the street in front of her house which had been a fashionable residential street when her father drove a buggy to the laboratory . There was a stunted elm just budding on the parking ; and Christa was talking softly about the rocks on the Dalmatian coast and how she had hurt her foot on a walking tour in Provence . And Lee was talking  --  also softly  --  about the Isis and the Cherwell in the spring and the punts and the gramophones and undergraduates shouting : I say , have you chaps got a needle ? in the long English twilight on the river . Christa 's eyes were halfclosed and her child 's throat lay stretched back over the seattop and the great sheaf of newstraw hair with darker stripes in it spilled backward and fanned out on the little shelf of the coupe . By simple motions such as are never foreseen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pressing her to him hard and smelling her clean , babyish smell of talcum and her cleanscrubbed American childhood with governesses and maids and private schools  --  and things a young girl must not do or read or think or see . Christa was not kissing back , nor helping him to kiss her , nor being exactly passive , but lying there in quietness , her long body stretched nut . I 'm sorry , Lee said , I did n't mean to do it  --  but you were so beautiful , I could n't help it . It 's all right , Christa said . I was surprised you did n't kiss me before . People kiss each other . But I mean I did n't want to kiss you because I 'd decided I was through with love . And I decided I would n't see you again after that first day at Erma 's because you were so damned haughty and did n't pay any attention to me . But , darling , people kiss each other . You 've got striped hair , Lee said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's really lovely . That 's one of the nicest things anyone ever said about me.  | And , Christa , I love you  --  I love the hell out of you . Christa laughed again : But it does n't mean anything . I kiss people . People kiss me . Who ? What people ? But it 's none of my business , I suppose . Sure , I do n't care . John Sheridan kisses me and Voder and lots of peeps . But John 's marriedYes , I know , Christa said indifferently , but he kisses me just the same . He kissed me the first time out at Erma 's that day . I was a little surprised . What did you do ? Nothin ' , ' cept let myself be kissed . Lee kissed Christa again , feeling her smoothtight cheekskin against his face and smelling her clean talcumpowder babysmell . But Christa , he said , I loved you when I first saw you , even if you would n't pay any attention to me . I never saw anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling , I 'm just a blonde floozy . Lee did not know where he was , nor what he was saying . He saw the lonely beam of the streetlight at the end of the block and the branches of the stunted tree , their green buds in shadow  --  and later he remembered the hunched shadowfigure of a young man going into the rooming house nextdoor to Christa 's house and a cigarette tossed with a splattering of sparks into the street . A street away , but remote , an early morning trolley skreeked and clanged and bumped in its definite course . He ( who lived in an arsenic-colored cell in the Y.M.C.A. ) sat with his arm around the girl who had grown up in the dark house . He knew then that the small living-room contained the pretty blue and gold and pink and gold watercolor of Christa in her teens ( with her head thrown back and a wind in her hair and the childlike curves of her neck so accurately drawn that you would not have thought them true , if you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venus de Milo , a signed selfportrait of a famous German lithographer , her father 's ashtrays , pewter and silver , engraved , like the one on Professor Whitehall 's mantel in Lawrence , with the arms of a student corps at Heidelberg and crossed sabres commemorating his student duels , when he was a young Dane like the Prince from Elsinore . Lee knew these things were there and he knew that when Brockdorfp153Schell had driven a buggy to the laboratory and even later when he had driven his first motorcar  --  when Christa 's mother had still looked like Christa looked now , a beautiful tall young girl not long out of Vassar  --  they were there except for the watercolor of Christa which was not painted yet . But it might as well have been there , for it was destiny that there be such a girl as Christa and such a picture of her above her mother 's mantelpiece . Christa called it the chocolatebox picture and said she did n't like the Goddamn ' thing  --  and secretly , Oh puke ! But it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink and gold  --  definitive as the work of a fine cabinetmaker . And perhaps a truer likeness than a color photograph . Lee had seen the watercolor and the Junker ashtrays and mugs and her father 's shaved head and the ridges of scartissue not fresh and new now as they had been under the cap of the student corps . The house was not very large and had a porch like the smalltown house in which Lee had been born  --  but there were the Junker arms , the watercolor of Christa , the cast of the Venus de Milo  --  and Christa herself in a dress perhaps from Paris with no silk at all in it to cover the ( fifteen year old , then ) back that the Academy painter had followed from London to Nice to Cannes and from Cannes to Juan les Pins  --  and she saying about the dress : Jesus H. God , my two-year-old Paris frock ! and treatingit ( though it looked new and much more distinguished than any in a roomful of rich debutantes ) as if it were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living-room of the house for Christa to come downstairs , he had looked long at the picture of her , trying to see her as she had been when she played in the garden at the back of the house and read The Wizard of Oz in English and Grimm 's fairy tales in German  - -  and trying to see her when she had quarreled with the other little girls  --  trying to see her when she hit that other little girl in the face and threw her down and rubbed her nose in the dirt  --  trying to see her as she moved , running , skipping , walking with dignity through the green spring streets of the city . And the sooty snow of the smoky winter and the hot miasmal nights of the summertime : And then trying to see her , slim and straight , her straight , higharched feet in Educator sandals , sneaking away from the private school in the afternoons to see hot love pictures in neighborhood cinemas with smuggled powder and rouge compacts concealed between the breasts which were beginning to stand up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to come with her . And the city where she was born was always new and old and secret ; and a place for discovery was always around the block . Sitting in her living-room looking at her picture and at her father 's ashtrays and the set of Goethe in German and all the small things scattered on tables ( things which he knew were perhaps in the world , but things which were foreign to the house where he had been born ) , Lee could see her moving through the years of the city , of Vassar , of the Wisconsin summers in a cabin , of the times in Paris and on the Dalmatian coast and of that time in Provence . He could see her getting on trains in the Union Station and on a bicycle in the damp college green of Vassar . And he could see the gangling youths and the young fellows ( Harvard and Yale and Amherst ) who had kissed her or tried to kiss her or followed her around . But always above these images was the image of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the way her head was set on her shoulders  --  and her newstraw hair fanned out in the coupe . It was so painful that he could hardly bear it , yet he thought more and more of her and wanted to see her more and more . And she said : But look here , my lad , you ca n't just play ducks and drakes with my social obligations . Oh , to hell with social obligations , he said hoarsely , his voice profane with yearning . Holy Christ  --  social obligations ! Christa laughed . But you know , even if one does n't like it , one has certain social obligations  --  friends . Peeps I 've known all my life and who 're pretty Goddamn ' fine in their own quiet way . They were getting out of the coupe at two o'clock in the morning in the dimlight of the cornerlamp and the nightsounds of the city ; and Christa , turning her head as she stood under the stunted elm in the parking before her house , caught the light in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a thousand things which did not concern him . And he knew that though he was thinking of other things ( of home when he was a boy and other girls and Papa and the Lyric Theatre and the bicycle and Dee Given and Breezy Gortz and Grandpa Beckham and Grandpa Harrington and Mamma and the tin sword and Anne 's house in Lawrence and Christ Church meadow in the spring ) that all these thoughts were mixed with now and mysticallychanged by Christa , though they remained things that had happenedas they had happened or as he had thought they had happened.  |p155And  he wished to say to Christa : I did not die once because of a threespeedbicycle which my father set beside my bed ; and once I had a tin sword that I stuck in my eye and Mamma took it away from me and threw it in the privy ; and Grandpa had white whiskers and fought with General McClellan at the battle of Gaines 's Mill  --  and I knew a girl once who was like the music of a clavichord and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisp in wintertime ! I love it ! I may go to South America , Christa said . I must go away to far lands . I ca n't stand this place . People squatting together ! Ugh ! WHEN Christa came back after the publicity trip for the railroad company whose fat , middleaged publicityman sent her American Beauty roses at every whistlestop where the telegraph company and the florists ' union could get them , she had a blue Virgin of Guadalupewaterbottle and stories about how she saw Sergei Eisenstein , the Russian film director , who had left Hollywood because they had wanted him to make Dreiser 's An American Tragedy as if it were a set of newspaper clippings about any American murder trial . He was making a proletarian film with peons and workmen as actors  --  and Christa went to see him shooting them in a few sequences . At the hotel there were a lot of comrades , Christa said , who were too amorous . And they said what the hell , were n't they all comrades together , and was n't Eisenstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown those Hollywood bourgeoisie rats he could n't be bought ? And when she was in Mexico City , she climbed up on the scaffold and talked to Jiminez , the great proletarian muralist . And he was charming and made her stay all morning  --  until her Royal Academy hack ached from sitting on the hard boards . By God , she kept saying , I know they 'll rise up and kill us all  --  and one ca n't blame them a damn ' bit ! But Lee always saw her with her head held high and with the soft curves of her child 's throat carrying a stately and arrogant pride . He thought of the Welsh queen Guinevere , and how she had been adulter/ous , and how often she had invoked dear Jesu , and how she had ended in a nunnery at Glastonbury . You are like Guinevere must have been , he said to her , smelling the babyish talcumpowder smell of her nice young girlhood . But I 'm a whited sepulchre , darling , she said . And I 'm not noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no reserve . My mother has almost completely despaired of ever making me a lady . But you are a lady in the best sense of the word , Lee said . And then that day at lunch when she said : Yes , I 'm sure your Grandfather must have been a fine Old Southern Gentleman . Lee did n't tell her any more about Grandpa Harrington , though he had meant to tell her that Grandpa Harrington had done no work in Fork City except to weed his mint patch for mint juleps . That was n't strictly true . There were the cows and the little milk route  --  and anyway , there was never any liquor in the house  --  nor money for it  --  to make juleps with . And Grandpa Harrington sat and read The Clansmanby Thomas Dixon , Jr . And Aunt Cornelia said it was Father's1 favorite book , because he knew all the characters in it  --  and if Lee would be a good boy and not call Grandfather Grandpa , someday maybe Grandfather would tell him about his Great Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing his words fading and Christa 's smooth Vassar voice saying what it did not finish , but what it put a polite unrounded period to . Yes , I 'm sure he must have been .. . But the waitress brought the check and he paid it and Christa said that hell she did n't want to go home . It would be just too bloody . By God , she was sick of 8899 Louisiana avenue and could n't they go to a movie  --  one of those lousy movies on Pine street . She just loved lousy movies . Why not ? Lee said ; and they went down into the dingy street which seemed bright and beautiful to Lee now . You could tell it was spring because of the soft , heavy air and the sun behind the smogclouds . Grimm and Gorly 's still had some gardenias at a dollar apiece , so he bought Christa one and said : And there stood Grimmie 's Gorly ghost with a white flower in his hands . Beautiful , she said and laughed like her childlips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a light beautifulmood and sat in the balcony and watched a gangster picture with James Cagney in it . And Lee put his arms around Christa and kissedp157her and nobody paid any attention to them  --  except maybe to smile that kissing was the right idea . When they came out it was almost dusk and cooler and Christa said : Oh , I 'm perfectly wild about lousy movies . And Lee said : I love you , Christa . There were about eighty of us after Pickett 's Charge , Uncle Pink said . Oh , a few more came in afterward when we got back into Virg ginia , but I do n't reckon we was more'n a hunderd and fifty when all was totaled up  --  and we had eight hunderd when we marched into Pennsylvania . Why , hell , Lee thought , Uncle Pinckney was an old actor who luxuriatedin talking like a hillbilly . How he loved the rich masculine quality of the word plowhannels ! . This ole feller talks in the tongues , do n't he Jud said . No , Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret encystation of years of defeat and corruption , Jud always spoke better English than I. Even 1 spoke better than I do now . You may have noticed how I catch myself now . Why , 1 was considered a good scholar in Gadkin County in my time . Maybe Jud said : Old Cawdor 's a fanatic , is n't he , Pink ? Ile 's what they call a Seventh Day Adventist , I said . Let 's slow down and have a drink , Jud said . My GREAT UNCLE Pinckney Harrington lived  --  maybe still lives  --  up in the hills outside of Caldwell , near where my father was born , Lee remembered . No , he was n't a hillbilly . Maybe it was n't the hills  --  maybe it was just near the hills . His house was a house too  --  not a cabin . But it was not painted , and the pine siding had got the gray weathered look that all those unpainted houses get down there in North Carolina . The heads of the nails were rusting off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sides in parallel lines . The porch , which was on one side , had honeysuckle on it and sloped like a sloven toward a wooden stoop . Both the house and the porch stood on little piles of rock  --  added to now and again when they seemed to settle  --  so that there was a gap of about a foot and a half between the house and ground . There were a couple of fat brick chimneys built on the outside of the walls . Inside there were a couple of fireplaces and a couple of mailorder house stoves . Two doors opposite each other  --  nearly always open  --  let air into the main room of the house , in which there was a long pine trestlelike arrangement with pine benches on either side of it . This was Uncle Pink 's board : At this his family and guests  --  when anybody was passing that remote way  --  ate . The house had bare pine floors , not very clean , a good many rooms of flimsy batten or wallboard partitions , windows with small panes  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seed catalog or two . In the front of the house there was another door which led out on the rickety porch from a sort of parlor or sitting-room . In this was a pair of photograph-and-crayon portraits of my great grandfather and great grandmother in walnut frames and photographs of my father and grandfather . My aunt 's organ and Uncle Pink 's fiddle were there too ; and a pineneedle pincushion souvenirof the Old North State from Blowing Rock was tacked to the wall . Maybe there was a stove in the center of the floor and a rag rug or two . I think there were some chairs called splitbottom  --  and a storeboughtor mailorder Morris chair with a tinbucket of the beergrowler type on the floor beside it for Uncle Pink to spit at while he sat in the bosom of his family as lord of the manor and patriarch . The place was hard to get at : I drove there in a spring wagon , through a cool drizzle . The spring had been unusually rainy and the roads were thick with red sticky mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old mill which you pass on the way to Uncle Pink 's ; and I remembered the old glossy print pasted in an old loose leaf photo album from my father 's studio , marked Fort Davis Views . It was the same mill , though the image had gone through the rapid rectilinear lens of the old Poco Camera almost thirty years ago . But the unpainted pine boards were trousers gray now ; and I could see the selfsame three knots in the double doors where the farmers had brought their corn to be ground into cornmeal and shared the meal with the miller for the grinding , in the days after the war when there was point to the story my Grandfather Harringtonused to tell about the man who shot the squirrel and said to hisp159wife : Well , Nancy , we-uns 'll live high while we 're a-livin '  --  we 'll eat us a whole ham of this yere squirrel . I looked at the old mill and the rickety wooden flume which had carried the water of a mountain creek , long since diverted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now stood still and ( lamp and green with moss , its iron shaft rusted  --  and probably stopped in the exact position those thirty years ago when the miller walked out of the mill with the last sack of meal over his shoulder , not even looking back at the millstone . I looked at the mill and thought of another story my father had told me about a lazy man in North Carolina . North Carolina was full of lazy men : Oh , in those early days you could let the pigs and cows roam and get fat . You did n't need to manure the land : you could just move on and build another cabin . The bees were on the hillside making sourwood honey from the gumtreefor you . But anyway there was a man who was powerful lazy  --  I reckin thar was n't a man in the hull state of Nawth Cahlina was as lazy as he was . He was so lazy they had to feed him as if he were a child to keep him from starving to death . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , because apparently , he was n't too lazy to git himself a lot of childern  --  and his wife was a good woman , but she could n't he expected to feed the whole family . Anyway , it got to be a sin and a shame the way that man would n't do a thing for himself . So the men folks in that neck of the woods had a meetin ' and decided that , if he did n't mend his ways , they 'd have to bury him alive . For he was practically dead anyway . Well , he did n't mend , so they made him a coffin . He did gather enough energy to say : Make it good and roomy and easy , boys ! They said they would , because they appreciated comfort themselves  --  being just normally lazy fellows  --  and never had anything personal agin the lazy man . It was just his mortal burden . Well , they dug the grave and hefted him into the coffin and nailed down the lid and started the wagon toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wagon . The wife and childern were walking along too , but nobody was saying a word  --  and everybody was looking mighty melancholy . They all just hated to bury Ole Watt . After all he was the laziest man in North Carolina . And they were kinder daggone sneakin ' proud of him fur that . Theyp160were almost to the buryin ' ground when one of them spoke up and says : I 'm willin ' to give Watt a bushel a corn , pervidin ' you all ai n't agin hit . We-uns ai n't agin ' hit . Did you hyear him , Watt ? I hyeard him boys , Watt says through the coffin . Air ye willin ' to reform an ' rustle around fur yer childern ? I 'm willin ' , Watt says . Well then , we 'll let Ty give you that bushel a corn . Hold on , Watt says , mortal weary , through the coffin . Air it shelled ? Naw , Ty says . It hai n't shelled . Drive on boys , Watt says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the old mill , Lee thought , and the wild waste of the country  --  and I began to understand the story . I began to see how heartbreakingthe story had been  --  and not funny at all . I began to see the melancholy of the country and to think , for the first time in my life , of my father as a North Carolina boy , born after those four years when his father had been marching on other men 's business . I began to feel the defeat in the air before I got to Uncle Pink 's house . I knew you were a Harrington minute I set eyes on you , Uncle Pink said . I knew you were Robert 's boy . Both of you look like Jud when he was a young man . Pinckney Harrington shook my hand with a small hardsurfaced cracked paw as he looked at me shrewdly with watery blue eyes . He was a small man in a pair of blue jeans suspended by one gallus over his left shoulder . Behind his left ear , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggshaped tumescent mass . The pouchskin , blue with the veins and stretched tightly by the bulk of this tumefaction , looked faintly damp . Uncle Pink seemed to be talking to me in a way I did not yet understand at all . From a great store he was showing me samples : an aspect of my father , a glimpse of my grandfather or his brother , a memory or two of them both before the background of those hills , those unpainted ruststreaked houses and those long-gone years of the Civil War which had added a glut of memories to this country in some forty months . My female cousin , a teacher who had gone to Le Gallienne Collegefor Women , said Uncle Pink got himself involved in Shotgun Wedding Decadence . He 's a bad egg . I 've got no use for him . Pinckney Harrington ? my uncle , her father , said . Shif'less , no'count . Lives in the hills . Plays a fiddle . Got a lot of childern in ten counties . War ? Hell no ! The war never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p161down  and ornery fore the war was even thought of . But Pinck- ney 's a smart feller . Trouble with him he buried his talent under a j bushel . He lives up thar in the hills and lets on he do n't give a damn . They said Uncle Pinckney was caught behind a laurel thicket with the woman he married  --  a mountain woman , she was supposed to be and much younger than he . Uncle Pinckney must have been around seventy-five ; and the shotgun wedding to the hill girl must have happened at least twenty years ago  --  but there were five or six young children standing around the door beside a graying woman with a lean face and descending belly and breasts . She was wearing a blue printed calico dress , drawn tight to the waist and blousing over , which gave her a loose strawstuffed appearance . She looked at me steadily with sharpfocussed brown eyes . Lee , Uncle Pinckney said , this is yore Aunt Sally . Sally , this is our nephew , Lee Harrington . Well , howdy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' image of Jud , ain'ty ? And these are your cousins , Uncle Pinckney went on : Anna and Elizabeth , Zebulon , Jeremiah , Judson  --  for your grandfather , and Moses  --  we hardly expected him at all , Uncle Pink said . ' T was almost as if we had found him in the bulrushes . Anna , who was perhaps sixteen , wore shoes and stockings from a mailorderhouse . But she looked at me with a level unselfconscious look of her brown eyes and smiled . Hello , Cousin Lee . She put out her hand with the grace of an outdoor beast , her small waist swaying a little . All the rest of them shook hands shyly . Anna had fine features , freckles around her nose , long straight legs and firm round breasts . Uncle Pink looked at her with a reminiscentand prideful look . That girl , Uncle Pink said , reminds me of her mother when we were sparkin ' . Ai n't she purty ? Papa ! Anna said , not in a bashful giggly tone such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's her own true sweetheart , but in a slightly sharp reproachful tone . As she said it her neck grew a little red ; and her mother smiled . Yes , Aunt Sally said , he 's the spit of Jud , all right , if you can judge by the pitcher . That 's right , Sally , Uncle Pink said , he is  --  and that 's judgin ' from life , when Jud was younger than when that picture was taken . He 's a Harrington , I can tell , Aunt Sally said . Mother always said Judson was a Cawdor , Uncle Pink said . She said : Look at that boy  --  there 's not a drop of Harrington blood in him . He 's nop162kin to you folks . Pinckney grinned , baring his yellow and brown tobaccoteeth . He 's a Harrington , all right , Aunt Sally said , but he favors Jud and Sion more'n he does you . Well , Lee , come in , Uncle Pink said . The victuals are purt near ready , ai n't they , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll bet you ai n't et since sunup  --  it 's a good piece from Caldwell here . He spoke the hill dialect with a little overtone of irony and not consistently  --  and a phantom smile curled up the corners of a reddish mouth under his shapeless gray brownstained moustache . Sally shore kin cook good , he said . Oh , she could cook , Lee remembered . I do n't think Pinckney Harringtonhad over ten acres of hill land  --  and he did n't work it much . But I sat down to that trestle with no tablecloth to biscuits four inches in diameter and light as a feather , a half dozen combs of sourwood honey , tender roasting ears , goldenbrown fried chicken , tender yellow wax beans , greens cooked with sidemeat , fine yellow cornbread , sweet potatoes , new potatoes , homesmoked ham , so tender you hardly had to bite at all , buttermilk , fine homechurned butter , white and brown sugar , hot rolls lighter than the biscuits , deepdish hotapple pie , cherry cobbler with thickcream  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All this was one meal and eaten off tin pie plates with steel knives and forks and drunk from tincups . Uncle Pink unbuttoned the two top buttons of his fly and fell to  --  so did the children . They were all good big eaters and there was a great plenty of everything . And there was plenty left when Aunt Sally and Anna began to clear it away . I 'm sure too , that these were no company victuals , for they had n't expected me ; and they all sat down to it as if it were nothing but the commonest of routine meals . After the meal proper , there were apples and cherries and grapes on the table just to munch at or top off on or to fill your belly good and tight and pull your hide good and taut so that you would feel warm and fed and satisfied . Boy , Uncle Pink said , I 've gone good an ' hongry in my day , an ' I do n't study to go hongry eveh again . We went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather tobacco pouch , filled a corncob pipe and lighted it with the thick satisfaction which comes from the anticipation of tobacco smoke over a full belly . So , he said , drawing a smooth long drag of the fragrant homecured smoke , my dear little niece , Clarissa , sent you up to see your wicked old uncle.  |p163She  told you , I 've no doubt , that I knew a lot about the Civil war and your grandfather  --  but that I was not really decent folks . She filled you up with dark innuendoes about shotgun weddings and ruint hillbilly gals . No , Uncle Pink , she did n't say  --  Now , do n't spare my feelen 's , boy , Uncle Pink said . I 'm an old reprobate , not fit to tie the shoes , let alone look upon our Pure Southern Womanhood . The Methodist kinfolks down in Caldwell do n't like me . I 'm an old pariah  --  I 'm the prodigal son who never came home , nor made a dime . You know , boy , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 've never been out of it  --  and your Aunt Sally in there 's one of ' em . Why , she planted a cedar tree years ago and named it fur Jim Collis who ruint her sister , so that soon as it was tall enough to cast a shadow across a grave , Jim 'd die . Well , the damn ' thing grew up just tall enough to do just that ; and not long after , Jim died , all right , and made a widow out of her sister . For he 'd been persuaded  --  Uncle Pink hoisted a pair of quotes around the word with his voice  --  to make her his bride . And not only that , Sally 's brother , Bedford , went to the arms of Jesus in the melee . They found Jim and him , stripped to the waist with their left arms tied together with a stout rope , and a pair of Bowie knives in their good right hands . Near the place where they bled to death there was a couple of jugs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't planted a single damn ' cedar tree since . Bedford was a wild , lanky hillbilly , who 'd just got a call to preach Christ while he was still between the plowhannels  --  an ' he set out to reform Jim .. They were both lickered to the gills . But that 's not to the point , Uncle Pink said . You want to hear about your grandfather and the Eighty-sixth North Carolina regiment . You 'd love to hear that yore ole granpappy was a chivalrous young Southron with a sword of justice in one hand and a mint julep in the other , but such things were not so . Jud was a nice boy . I was ever right fond of Jud  --  mebbe I was fonder of Jud than the rest of us : Let 's see  --  there was Sion and Joshua and Saul and Martha and Cornelia and Daniel and Jud and me . There was Paul and Timothy too , but they died as childernalmostbabies  --  and I never knew them except as headstones in the family burial ground and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my childhood : Those were made as if she were referring to a burnt papyrus which had been in the library at Alexandria . So , for me , Paul and Timothy were always secret and remote . Perhaps Paul would have been a tall man like my brother , Daniel . Timothy was marked with a little cross over his heart . It rained the day they buried Timothy and the preacher dropped his grandfather 's bible , which had come all the way from Edinburgh , in the mud . I thought Paul had had the yaws . And I thought the yaws were birds , Uncle Pink said . And I always saw Paul  --  and do still  --  walking around the fields in a set of long baby skirts followed by a solemn procession of strange black birds , not like crows  --  but bigger . They had golden beaks and the same purply black feathers as crows when the sun fell right on ' em and red roses growing out of the tops of their heads  --  and their eyes were red and shining as rubies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yaw-yaw , yaw-yaw , slow and carefulof the way they pronounced it in deep niggerpreacher voices . I would see Father come into the house and hear him say to mother : Where are those yaws ? And Mother would answer : Paul has the yaws , Ezekiel . Ah , Father would answer , that boy has taken to the yaws and the yaws have taken to him . He has had the Call . To this day I can still see Brother Paul , who died before I was born , walking through the fields with the yaws following him . Timothy , I never saw so clearly , but when I did see him , he was always hanging on a cross like Jesus  --  and over his heart , was nailed another little cross . He always had a crown of mountain laurel on his head and a sweet , innocent expression on his face  --  no suffering at all . I have never before told these fancies of childhood to a living soul  --  and I tell them to you only that you may form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been like in the North Carolina Piedmontbefore the war . Once when I was older  --  say ten or so  --  I asked my mother if it was true that Paul had the yaws . Pinckney Harrington , you must never use that word again . What are the yaws ? I asked Mother . Pinckney , use that word again and I shall ask your father to punish you . I found out later what the yaws were , in truth , but I shall always think of them first as those goldbeaked roseheaded , preachervoiced birds following Paul through the fields and being careful of their pronunciation . Now , Uncle Pink said , you must not think of the war as being long ago or out of date , or of this country in that day as being anything but here and now for your grandfather and me and your Unclep165Sion , who was in the Eighty-sixth North Carolina regiment too . It 's true that we lived in a backward provincial country , and that we did n't get much news of what we may call the Outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we awoke in the mornings of the Eighteen fifties and sixties as boys who lived in the Modern World . You can be sure that we had heard of the big Cunard steamships which were crossing the Atlantic ocean ; and when we talked of the telegraph a great excitement possessed us . I remember how Sion and me used to talk of trains long before we had ever seen one  --  and later Jud used to ask us about them . We did not have much : Father had set out from Virginia as a young man and drifted from the Tidewater section of North Carolina to the Piedmont , where he bought some land and negroes and built himself a fine frame plantation house . He reset some boxwood hedge around the front porch and in the back yard and went to work industriously to make it a fine productive plantation . But it seems that , back in Virginia , one of his brothers , a man who could not see a fly buzzing around two molasses jugs without backing the fly to light on one or the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , duelled himself into a fugitive  --  and saddled their father with his debts . My father felt obliged to help his father with this burden . That was how my father 's family began to lose ground . I believe only Timothy was born in that old house . I learned long since , and from no member of the family , that my father was forced to sell it because of this brother , of whom , besides the charge that he was a gambler and a duellist , the only other bit of hearsay says that he knew Edgar Poe at the University and recognizedPoe 's genius to the extent of laying a bet on it . But the story says that Father removed to a smaller farm in this neck of the woods . That 's where your grandfather and the rest of us were born . No , Uncle Pink said , we were never exactly poor white trash , for it was always right hard to fall into that category in this section of North Carolina , but it was a near thing after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were at Chapel Hill for a couple of terms after the war , for even then , Father wanted to do what he called make something of us . We 'd been born in a fairly large cabinlike house , which was not a half mile from here . And Father still owned a fair-sized chunk of land , three buck niggers , who must have been prime field hands in their day and a cook who was married to one of the bucks  --  or said she was.  |p166Nevertheless  Mother had a good bit to do . She spun and wove the wool and cotton and made our clothes until we were big boys  --  and even after that . And Father worked good and hard with his farming to get something ahead to educate us . I remember one winter we ate so many grits , I began to hate the sight of ' em . Even today , I seldom eat ' em  --  though after the war there were times when I was glad to get ' em . Your grandfather , Judson , was maybe fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zebulon Vance 's old regiment . We signed up at the courthouse  --  there was a whole company from Gadkin county . Well , to be scrupulously correct about it , there was maybe four companies ' strength all told through the war . For the Eighty-sixth was entirely killed about twice in the course of the war . I reckon Jud and me thought that war was somethin ' like a big picnic with firecrackers where all the soldiers wore bright buttons and pretty uniforms with gold braid  --  and after the battle got themselves waited on and petted by the ladies . Sion had already got himself shot at Seven Pines . And we had it from somebody 's letter that he had saved old Elisha Wagg 's  --  the captain of the Gadkin county company  --  life at Malvern Hill . Well , Jud and me , like most boys of the time wanted to jine Jeb Stuart 's cavalry , but we did n't have any hawses . It was a bitter thing I can tell you not to be able to get into the First North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rode hell-for-leather all over and around the Yankees . And what was worse , all the girls all over the South had heard about ' em . So that every female 's dearest dream was a young planter-aristocrat in jackboots , sabre and a black ostrichplume . There was a passel of talk about beauty and chivalry . Somehow every man who got up on a hawss and rode around with the cavalry corps of the Army of Northern Virginia was a True Knight . Women and hawses ! Uncle Pink said . They bet on the hawser and fought oveh the women . The hawses were the most useful ; they would carry them where they wanted to go . Mebbe the women did manage the plantation house and swoon at the right times  --  mebbe they did make bandages and attend the wounded . But I never saw any of ' em . And they were spoken of only as Paragons of Purity and Beauty and Womanhood . Almost any gal whose father had a few nigrahs and a farm that grew a few bales of cotton or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baroness at least . The daughters of the big plantations thought themselves equal to royal duchesses . Theyp167kept sayin ' the words Honor and Chivalry and Pure Sweet Womanhoodover and over to themselves until they believed that they were the only real lords and ladies holding their lands en feoff from God , Who had favored them . They kept thinking that they were some noble mystical thing the nature of which had never been rightly plumbed . Oh , there were some beautiful highspirited women among them  --  and most of the planters were howlin ' brave . Some of ' em were right smart scholars too . But all of ' em tried to act as if the Southern Aristocracy was privy to some divine secret that nobody else knew , when it was nothing more than a matter of acres and niggers . There never was a lot of high-falutin ' aristocrats in North Carolina . Zeb Vance came down from the hills of Buncombe county and went to Chapel Hill . I think he lived in Old South where your grandfather and I stayed . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We knew that we were thought of as lowborn beside Virginians and South Carolinians and that touched us in the quick . And we knew too that we were just as innately aristocratic as any uppity South Caroliniansor Virginians  --  even the ones of us whose daddies owned the least niggers knew that . Still the boys from the big plantations got the pretty pampered gals and rode the blooded hawses and wore the fine clothes . And the war was fought to save the hawses and gals and clothes for those same boys . But did Jud and Sion and me know that ? Not on your life ! We joined the old Eighty-sixth North Carolina Infantry with the idea that we were a couple of fine knights like you read about in Sir Walter Scott 's books . I HAD been ordained a priest of the Protestant Episcopal church , . Wagnal said , when I brought Katherine back to Knoxville , Iowa in the fall of 1865 . Since it was sometime , then , after Appomattox , his family had given Rome up for dead . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myra , your grandmother , tell of it many times : The Hanks house was on a little hill . Myra was sitting on the porch to get the cool of the evening and some of the younger children were playing in the yard . He came , walking slowly and un/steadily , up over the hill  --  and Myra saw his skinny silhouette , black against the red sky . One of the children said : Look ! Look at the old scarecrow-man ! Ai n't he funny ! Shh ! Shh ! Myra said . Never , never make fun of anybody ! You do n't know ever what 'll happen to you . And then she saw it . She got a view of some angle or movement which had been wellknownto her since she could remember this world . Oh ! Myra said . Oh ! Oh ! My Goodness ! It 's Papa , Ma ! Ma ! she screamed . Ma ! It 's Pa . He 's come home ! Oh ! Pa ! Papa ! She was out of the white picket gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up over the hill . Papa ! Papa ! She almost knocked Rome down when she put her arms around him . Now , Myra , honey , Rome said , Now , now , do n't you touch me any more  --  I 'm none too clean . But he was clean  --  there was a little train dust on him , that was all . It was then she noticed how bad and thin he looked  --  and his hands . They looked black  --  and it seemed to Myra a little finger was gone . Run in and tell your mother to get some water hot , Rome said . And get me Dr. Wagnal , if he 's home . He ai n't a doctor any more , Papa  --  he 's a preacher . A preacher ? Episcopal , Myra said . She took her father 's arm and led him to the porch . He sat down panting on the porchedge as Mrs. Hanks came out . Romulus ! Romulus ! she said . Where have you been ? Where ? She started to kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it was not catching in Baltimore , but do not touch me yet a while . I am a loathsome thing . Where were you , Romulus ? ' In Andersonville prison , Rome said . I did not die ! I did not die ! Mrs. Hanks and Myra looked at each other in wonder . Papa had spoken in a high screechy way and laughed and when he opened his mouth his gums looked black with blood in the dusk . I did not die , Myra ! Rome said screeching out a cracked laugh . I said I would come home to Ioway , and I came . Where 's Thomas ? Thomas ! Thomas ! He means Doctor  --  Reverend Wagnal , Myra said . Go get him ! Mrs. Hanks said . Get him ! And tell him to bring his medicine  --  that your Papa 's home sick. j He fainted before I got there . He fainted and squittered in his trousers , before they could get them off  --  but Mrs. Hanks had him washed and in bed when I got there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed muttering in his once fine live beard  --  now like so much dirty hay . The outline of every bone in his skull was easy to see ; andp169his breath made the air fetid all around the bed ; his legs were covered with dark purple scorbutic ulcers , with elevated fungoid surfaces . Two of his toes were gone ; and there were maggots in one of the stubs . I stayed a couple of hours before he opened his eyes . Thomas , he said , I 'm glad you 've come . Where did they take you ? Atlanta ? Bates is not here , but Toothless is . Oh , Thomas , there 's a drummer boy here like Drumbutt  --  wears a red cap . He 's got a sailor who keeps the rest of ' em off him . The sailor was in the British Navy before he went with Porter . Sodom . But they took us in boxcars  --  and Toothless saved me . But my side hurts yet . I 'm glad you 're here , Thomas . Maybe you can help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the itch . Ah , no , Thomas , I am not glad , for Dante 's hell was nothing to this . Sodom , Thomas . I should like to know the truth about it . Perhaps there 's a history . My side , Thomas  --  get the maggots out . I ca n't sleep . Last night they took everything I had  --  even the letters from Myra . He said he did n't get no letters from home here , and he could read good too . I turned him over on his left side , Wagnal said , and the wound was closed but still red . On the right it was the same way but a little lower . He was hot as a blast furnace . Mrs. Hanks put her hand to his forehead . It 's only fever , I said . I gave him an opiate . For two months I gave him opiates . And Mrs. Hanks fed him as much as she could . Myra and she sat beside the bed , holding his hand at night and stroking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil lamp sitting here now , Wagnal said , seems only to deepen the gloom around us . It is a long time now since any light but the sun at high noon does anything but plummet me down into the depths of darkness . I never venture into the streets here at night , because the electric lights , falling on the lawns and parkings in the summertime through the almost substantial heat  --  the heat curtain , the membranous heat , the gauzy heat of the night , the cobweb tent of heat over all ,  --  because the electric lights falling on the lawns and parkings , the jimson weed and ragweed and milkweed on vacant lots , the elmtrunks and mapletrunks and the sheathing and the stone of the houses plunges me down into the nethermost region of the hell of the old night . For now I am old . And each memory is a shock that racks this big , clumsy arthritic frame . No , Wagnal said , with **32;206;TOOLONG his words like a breeze playing around the corners of a **31;240;TOOLONG house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heatgauze over the sounds of children laughing and screaming and screendoor slamming and the escaping steam and the slow bells of the locomotives  --  and the long blast of the engines whistling the crossings on the prairie . I can not stand the light over these things , for when I see it over them , I know again that I was young and that I am old now and that I walked in a street in Keokuk thinking of Katherine Theron as Harold Bates walked past me with a girl with a primpedup red mouth on a silly ovalface . I can not stand the light falling over the little spots of night , for I know it is falling in New Haven and Edinburgh and Iowa and Georgia and Mississippi and Tennessee  --  and up on the hill outside of town on Katherine 's grave . That summer in Knoxville when Rome first came home I did not know how light falls upon the earth . For Katherine was with me  --  and even the yellow wickflame beside Rome 's bedhead , which threw shadows around his sunken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , which had not been eroded so deep at Atlanta  --  did not frighten me . But perhaps , even then , I knew that light was there  --  with gloom and shadows poured over the sounds of summer , as if black , thick suffocating oil were forced down your throat thickly with a piston . Why , boy , I saw Atlanta burning in the night , the ammunition trains blowing fire into the dark of August . I saw the firelight of a hundred plantations licking the Southern night . I saw it bouncing on the barrels of bronze Napoleons from the North as they moved down the road toward the sea . But I did not know anything about light then . I can see the bones in Rome 's cheeks now  --  I can see all the shadows from the oil lamp as I did not see them then . For Katherine was at home two blocks away or sitting across Rome 's bed from me , holding his hand down tight to the quilt so that he would not thrash the cover off until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mrs. Hanks wiping his sweatshining forehead and the Star-of-Bethlehem pattern of the quilt rising and falling in convulsive jerks as he breathed . Thomas , Katherine said , you must not let Mr. Hanks die , for I love him . He smiled at me last night with his black gums and his pale lips and called me , Myra , honey . Now , I love him Thomas  --  even the sores on him . So you must never let him die . He did not die then . For a good many years I thought that it was because I did everythingp171I knew how as a doctor  --  and because after I got home from each visit , I went into my study and knelt down on the floor and prayed hard that the Father , Son and Holy Ghost would save Rome . For I loved him too  --  and before God , sir , Wagnal said , when Katherine said she loved Mr. Hanks , it made him twice as dear to me . Shuball York and Don Trott and old John Simpson used to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then they would come home with us . Katherine would always ask Myra to come , but she never would until Rome was out of bed . We used to walk the two quiet blocks to our house on a stone sidewalk beside an iron fence . On one corner there was a big square brick house with a chimney in the middle of the roof and keystones above all the windows . Don Trott used to start off singing : There was an old man , and he had two sons  --  And these two sons were brothers . Josephus was the name of one , Bohunkus of the other . We all joined in  --  even old John Simpson , dour as he was . At our house Katherine gave them elderberry wine and popped popcorn in a skillet  --  and Don Trott ran home five blocks and back with his mandolin . We sang until good and late , Shuball beating time on the floor with his wooden leg . Little Brown Jug and Lorena and The Girl I Left Behind Me . All of them worshipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps I was happy , Wagnal said . Katherine and I had a fifteen-room white frame house . It had a wide porch all the way around three sides of it with jigsaw scrollworkeverywhere there was a place to nail it to  --  a tower with round windows in it and a cast iron railing of maple leaves around the top . We had a deep lawn with a long white picketfence around it ; and before the front gate there was a white steppingstone on either side of which was the iron figure of a small negro boy in a brightpainted yellow sailor hat and a green coat  --  each was holding out his right hand , a ring to tie your horse to . But you know how they looked . There was a pair of them here on Hamilton street in front of the old White place . Katherine and I used to walk past them on summer nights just to see and remember how those in Knoxville looked  --  but their coats were yellow , and the lawn was n't as deep , and the porch was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house  --  and the trees had n't the girth of those in Knoxville . But perhaps they had . For I was happier in Knoxville and Katherinewas happier there for a while  --  though people did not like it when she rode old Percy . He was six then . He and the Cellini ewer were the only things that she brought from Mississippi with her . Her Father had forbidden her to marry me , and , though he did not allow himself the melodramatic gesture of cutting her off without a cent , he made it so unpleasant for her that she took nothing but the horse and the ewer , gifts from her grandfather . Oh , we knew that Una and Clint were married . It was in the Burlington papers : Brevet Major-General Clinton Belton , formerly colonelcommanding the Hundred and Seventeenth Iowa Veteran VolunteerInfantry , one of Burlington 's most promising young attorneysat-lawand Republican National Committeeman for this district and Miss Una Theron , daughter of Mr. Fulke Theron , II , Theron Plantation , Messenger 's Ferry , Mississippi , a direct descendant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were united in marriage at the First Protestant Episcopal Church of Burlington , something 1865 , Wagnalsaid . The bride wore a wedding gown by the famous dressmaker , Worth , of Paris , France : white satin embroidered with seed pearls . The veil twenty yards of the sheerest tulle was caught to her hair by a bandeau of pearlsThey had taken a house in the most fashionable section of Burlington ; and Una had set out to astonish and confound the natives . She gave them oysters on the halfshell , consomme , sweetbreads , chicken cutlets , pheasant , ices , charlottes , candy , tea , coffee and four kinds of wine for luncheon . The Burlington women must have begun to hate her before she got Clint away from there and to Washington . Oh , I believe there can be no doubt that she was thoroughly hated and feared in Burlington  --  as she was later in Washington . But she was never hated by the right people , the people who could advance hers or Clint 's position  --  until they had lifted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Clint must have found himself losing some of his popularity with the political brigadiers and colonels whom he had cultivated , with Havanas and Bourbon , during the war , for , as I remember it , there were a good many of those old boys who had no grammar , twanged outlandishly through their noses and pretended thatp173they were of good common stock  --  as common as dirt and friends of the people  --  perhaps on the ground that the people preferred to be cheated by men who appeared to resemble themselves in ignorance , uncleanliness and a certain vulpine cunning , which would meet with such appreciative phrases as : I God , ole so-an ' - so 's purty Goddamn ' cute , ain'ty ? Shore ca n't git ahead a-him . He 's too Goddamn ' smart fer ' em . From the beginning , however , in the camps of the Army of Tennessee , when the Crimean and Drumbutt had served the whiskey , they had been a leetle suspicious . An English batman pouring good honest American licker to good honest American politicians serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they thought of themselves in those terms , for they were delicate thinkers , all right . They could take a premise and think it all around Robin Hood 's barn  --  until they had so exhausted it that it would weakly yield them up any conclusion they wished . ) And , when they came to think about it , Clint Belton had always been a little too well-groomed for a volunteer officer . Take Sherman , take all those doggy West Pointers , even take that fellah Stuart  --  well , naow they hadda right to spruce up . They was use to it . It was a part of a reg'lar soldier 's discipline  --  but there reely was n't any call for an Ioway volunteer to strut around like a featherassed bird . They had always thought that Belton was jilt a leetle too slick fer his own good  --  too Goddamn ' much of a purty rooster . They had come to believe that somehow demagoguery and political graft were guiltless , if they were clothed in roughandready plainasanoldshoe garments . Little Clint cared about these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would have availed him nothing . For Una was , more and more , making the decisions and planning the strategy . General Grant was their house guest when he stopped in Burlington on that tour he took with President Johnson and Admiral Farragut and General Custer . While he was there Una allowed nobody to meet him and petted and flattered Grant until , I 've no doubt , he thought her one of the most beautiful , charming and tenderhearted young women in the world . I can hear her , Katherine used to say : Dear General Grant , why do n't they let you alone  --  after those horrible four years you so willingly gave to your country ? General Belton and I have often said to ourselvesthat such tiring trips as this should not be commanded by that person  --  that tailor  --  in the White House , have n't we Clinton ? And Katherine would tell me how Una would sit there at table , with all her cold regal airs concealed , making poor , old , shy Grant wonder how so beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding  --  and making him remember how Rawlins had brought him those fine Havanas ( which he could n't tell from the cheap weeds he used to buy in the stores at Galena and Cairo and Springfield when he could n't raise enough money to buy a uniform and his volunteers made fun of him ) . Oh , yes , Grant was charmed that he did n't have to have this beautiful woman tied to a post , gagged and her rations stopped for a day , as he had had to do to the regimental badman in Springfield , to have her salute him . From the beginning , Una must have had him in the palm of her hand . And Clint was learning from Una . Oh , I 've no doubt that he fancied himself as the dashing young lawyer-general , a Harvard man who had gone pioneering and commanded a regiment from Iowa , later to become a brigadier and finally to be brevetted Major-General  --  but this woman from Theron House near the Big Black River had taught him humility and , more than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . There was , however , an alarming circumstance which attended the upward march of Una and Clint . It had cost money to astonish and humble the wives of the political brigadiers and the society ladies of Burlington . You did not get bluepoints on the halfshell from New Englandin the sixties without paying for them ; you did not get Worth to tell his rosary over your gowns for nothing ; and you did not serve four kinds of wine at an envy lunch for nothing . Clint 's practice in Burlington was ample for a life of simple plenty  --  but not for what Una thought was her due . Money came in in great quantities from Mississippi , until the beginning of the year Eighteen hundred and sixtynine . That year gave the Black Republican newspapers almost as fine a story as the time Butler waved the bloody shirt : Mr. Fulke Theron , II , and Rasselas , his negro servant , who had served him at Balliol College , Oxford , were found dead and naked in the middle of the drive before Theron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was horribly mutilated . Nobody saw the fire : A negro admitted to the judge that he seed a reddinin ' up in de sky las ' night oveh tode Gen'l Theron 's place , but he calcalated de Gen'l was buhnin ' some mo ' cotton fo ' feah de Yankees gon na take it . That was in 1869 when cotton was seldomp175burnt to save it from the Yankees  --  and everybody had known for a good long time that even during the war no cotton had ever been burnt on the Theron place . The negro reckoned that the white folks would n't have to buhn no mo ' cotton soon as Gen'l Pemmuhton and Gen'l Lee whupped the Yankees . A scallawag prosecutor told the negro that the war was over . Yes , suh , maybe it oveh  --  I ain ' sayin it ain ' oveh . He was trembling . I cain ' tell mahse'f  --  Warner county too big . Did you see any Ku Kluxers ? You mean ghos ' of Cunfedit soljuhs ? Naw , suh . Ain ' seed any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shiloh las ' yeah . He ain ' had drink sence de battle an ' he drink down de whole bucket . I ain ' eveh seed no mo ' . Did you know Rasselas , the Theron negro ? I knew him some . He talk white . He talk funneh  --  not like niggah . The next day the carpetbag judge found this negro lying trussed up on the steps of the Jackson courthouse . The judge thought it was the same one anyway . He was naked and all the hair was singed off him and his eyes had been poked out and a court subpoena was stuffed into his mouth . He had been shot and stabbed about a dozen times  --  and the fire that singed his hair off had just begun to roast him . Of course he had been castrated . The distinguishing feature of the killing , however , was discovered when the judge pulled the subpoena out of his mouth ; there was no tongue . Katherine and I arrived at Messenger 's Ferry after Mr. Theron and Rasselas had been buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high when we drove into the park . I had never been there in the winter . The moss dripped with a week 's drizzle and the trees  --  some with no leaves and whitish bark  --  sweated . The roads were a hopeless mass of loblolly . Cady Ocamb  --  Colonel Cady Ocamb  --  had sent the wire to Iowa . He drove us out from Jackson in a surrey . I can see his prizebull face now , grave and heavy as he guided the one old livery horse into the gap where the iron gate with the griffons , lions and crocodiles had been . I am still of the opinion , Mrs. Wagnal , Ocamb said , that you should not undergo this ordeal . Thank you , Colonel Ocamb , Katherine said . I wish to see what 's left of the house . We could smell the damp ashes as the old horse 's hooves and the wheels scrunched on the gravel . I noticed in the lighter dark of winter in the park that there were spots where there was no gravel now  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone , though I could see no stumps in the high grass and weeds . Colonel Ocamb , Katherine said , who are these fools in flannelette nightgowns who killed my father ? I cai n't say ma'am , Ocamb said . Are you a Klucker , Mr. Ocamb ? I am not , ma'am , Ocamb said stiffly . Who did that to my father and Rass ? Well , ma'am , I ai n't alone in mah belief that it was an outrage pupputrated by the freed nigrahs . This tuhble deed , ma'am , was no doubt the deed of the Loyal League nigrahs  --  black hahted rascals that they ah . They wished to possess Mr. Theron 's land  --  and they did not like his faithful nigrah servant . Such outrages , ma'am , ah bound to transpiah while the govahmint is in the hands of the scallywags and cahputbaggahs . It was not they , Katherine said , because was not my father consideredlittle better than a niggerlover himself ? I had not huhd of that ma'am , Ocamb said , his great face falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father made dangerous remarks in Jackson and Vicksburg ? Was it not that he said that he failed to see the difference between the negro race and the white , except for the pigments ? No , ma'am , Ocamb said , still looking straight ahead of him at the spots empty of gravel in the road . Well , Mr. Ocamb , Katherine said , I do not believe you . I think that you and your shirttail paraders killed my father . And the only reason I rode out here with you was to watch you as you answered the questions I have just asked you . You are not a good liar , Mr. Ocamb . Thank you , ma'am , Ocamb said . Puhaps , suh , you wish to offah some suppoht to youah wife 's statements . Yes , Colonel Ocamb , I said , I am at your service . Cady Ocamb , Katherine said , and you , Thomas , listen carefully to me . It was my father who was killed . There will be no more shootingfor honor . You will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll grant you  --  but you do not want to get all your friends into trouble and have a regiment of Yankees camping on your wife 's doorstep . Please apologize to my husband . Katherine 's eyes were slits and her dimples were up in her face  --  she was smiling with rage . I beg youah pandon , suh . I apologize . He was looking at the gravel on the drive in front of the houseless columns . Now , Thomas , to make it even , apologize to Colonel Ocamb . Thus honor will be satisfied , Katherine said . I apologized . I still think you a liar , Colonel Ocamb , Katherine said . Thank you ,  |p177ma'am  , he said humbly , looking at Katherine with a sluggish bovine yearning look . And I know you to be as brave as a Spanish bull . The columns stood soot-blackened with long rivermarks where the rainstreams had trickled down them showing pinkly through the black . And on the drive there lay bits of charcoal  --  woodghosts of the house . The pediment was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the front wall . There was a wind from the othah way , Ocamb said , or it would have been the pahk . The white-washed walls were smoked in splotches ; and where they were n't the thick layers of whitewash came off in little checks when you put your hand on them . I picked up a fragment of one of the porcelain waterclosets ; and Katherine found a key of the harpsichord and a bit of the frame which had been around the quadroon . But we found nothing else . The little Venus in the park had been beaten to pieces as with a hammer ; and the Greek temple had lost a column . Come , Katherine said , let us look at the graves . Katherine walked around the two box sarcophagi and stood looking at the new gravemounds for a moment . Let us go now , Thomas , she said . Let us go back home and never come back here again . It is too damp and sad here . I saw Ocamb looking at a corner of flannel caught under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think Katherine saw it . YOUR great grandmother , Uncle Pink said , got hold of some fine gray broadcloth from Richmond and some firegilt buttons from Wilmington that had come over on a blockader , and made Jud and me some uniforms . She must have had an idea about how we felt about knighthood , for she made the jackets neat as anything . I think Father knew too , for he bought us some fine boots and a pair of leatherbound diaries  --  I never wrote in mine , and Jud burnt his . We joined the regiment in Virginia in the winter of sixty-two  --  and that night we went out into the woods and rolled around in the dirt , because hardly anyone in the regiment had a uniform . Most of ' em just had a pair of homespun jeans and a jacket and a hickory shirt  --  and right much of the time the jeans and jacket were cotton.  | But we were luckier'n fools . Ole Wagg , the captain of the Gadkin county company , was an ignorant kindhearted ole critter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a neck like a prize bull . He did n't have any uniform , but he wore a rusty black cutaway coat with a sword and pistol strapped into the meat of his belly . It was the biggest pistol ever I saw  --  we had a lot of funny names for it . Maybe he himself had sewed the captain 's shoulder straps on his coat . He was half hillbilly and always ' lowed his Pa had fit at King 's Mountain . He said the War was a war fur God  --  and he could coat scripter to show hit was . He never allowed anybody to say anything in his presence about our new uniforms  --  and he took care of the Gadkin county company as if they were his own childern . Anything he could share with us he shared  --  anything but hardship . He tried to take all that on himself . Many 's the time on the march I 've seen him throw a boy on his back and tote him a mile or two . And nobody ever dared plague the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fur it , he cai n't holp it ! Wagg used to say glaring . We had a long tall feller , another half hillbilly , Harrison Lacey by name , who was as mean as they make ' em . He came from way up in the Toe river valley . They used to say he had killed a half dozen men before the war and liked to kill ' em with knives , ' cause they bled so good thataway  --  same as he liked to hunt bar with knives . He was proud and independent an ' as damn ' ignorant and superstitious as ever I knew a hillbilly to be . He would n't take orders from no man livin ' , he said . Wagg told him to go fotch some firewood to cook the grub one night  --  and Lacey reckoned he did n't study to do no woman 's work . He jined fur fightin ' . Wagg told him twice . The second time Lacey pulled out a knife and went fur Ole Wagg . Some of the other boys stepped up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulltone . I 'll hannel him . Well , Lacey come up like a big cat , fast an ' easy an ' cautious , the knife ready fur Wagg 's ribs . Wagg lumbered around a little an ' stood still . Soon as Lacey got in close an ' swung down with the knife , Wagg grabbed his wrist in that big meaty paw of hisn and put the other arm around Lacey 's waist . That move of Wagg 's did n't look fast , but it was . I thought Lacey ai n't never met him no bar like this'n . After Wagg got that holt , it was just a matter of time . You could see the meat standing out in ridges under their clothes  --  and finally you began to see Lacey bendin ' over backwards . Then his hand opened and thep179knife fell out on the ground , but Wagg still kept a-bendin ' him over backwards . He did it so slow you could n't tell how much power he was usin '  --  but I remember listenin ' for Lacey 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and held him there for a minute . Well , Lacey says , you got me . Git the killin ' done . I hai n't aimin ' to kill you , Lacey . You better , by God , Lacey says , er I 'll kill you when I git up . Do n't be a Goddamn ' fool , Lacey , Wagg says . We got other killin ' to do . I 'll make you a proposition . I 'll fight you any way you pick after the war 's oveh . Meantime whilst I 'm captain here , you obey my odehs . Ai n't neveh been at no man 's beck , Lacey says . This yere 's wah , Wagg said . You hai n't at my beck  --  you at the beck of the Kunfedrit Gov'mint . I ai n't holdin ' myself up as a better man than you , but I 'm captain and represent the Gov'mint  --  and you at the Gov'mint 's beck . After the wah , I 'll fit you with fists , knives , pistols er cannon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all right and tuck orders from Wagg from then on  --  but I saw him finger his knife and look at Wagg several times after that . Gettysburg , Uncle Pinckney said ,  --  what they call Pickett 's Charge . The Highwater Mark of the Confederacy ! Why they call it a highwatermark , I never could tell . Mebbe a highblood mark . That would be better . And Pickett 's Charge ! It would be just as correct to say Pettigrew 's Charge . The Virginians got all the credit for that assault . You know we might have got ' em that day . Yes , sir , we might have got ' em  --  if something had n't happened . They said it was old Longstreet'sfault . I read a lot of pieces in the Century Magazine , one where Longstreet himself said it was n't his fault  --  but that was after he turned scallawag . But whose-ever 's fault it was  --  it was a killin ' for the Yankees . After a good many years , Lee , you git to thinkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a tarnal fool ? That was n't my fight , or Jud 's , or pore Sion 's . It may have been Robert E. Lee 's and Wade Hampton 's and Jeb Stuart 's  --  but it was n't even ole Tom Jackson's. let alone Zeb Vance 's . There were , as you know , three days of the battle of Gettysburg . When we marched into Pennsylvania , I thought it was the purtiest green fenced-in , tidied-up country ever I saw . They ai n't shif'less up there like we are down here . I liked it fine  --  looked as if there was a-plenty of everything for everybody . It did n't look so damn ' tired and shabby as this country looks even in the spring.  |p180Michigan  and Minnesota , what they like ? Jud said . Where are they , Pink ? Do n't you remember yore jogaphy ? I said . Father taught you himself  --  with his finger on the map . I was n't much hand with jogaphy , Jud said . There 's cartridges there , I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wagons , and we got orders to git ' em . The young Yankee 's blood was thick and clotted on the grass beside his neck where the minnie ball had tore a big hole . Flies and bugs and ants were crawlin ' all over his face . The ants were diggin ' into his wideopen blue eyes . He had Michigan on his belt buckle and collar  --  Michigan and a number . Mebbe twenty-four . There was right many of ' em around Jud and me in that field  --  some of ' em marked Michigan and some of ' em marked Minnesota . Mebbe I shot him , Pink , Jud said . Mebbe you did , Jud , I said . What of it ? That 's what we jined fur  --  to shoot Yankees . I wonder what Michigan'slike ? he said . Ai n't there a lake up there ? Shore is , I said . Mebbe he went swimmin ' in it , like we used to do in the Gadkin . It 's too big , I said  --  like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Look at that ! Jud hollered . Not more'n fifteen feet away Lacey was sticking a Yankee in the belly with his bayonet . The Yankee had thrown down his musket and had a bolt of the sharp blade ( Lacey kept it honed good ) trying to twist it out of his belly . You 've seen a constipated man settin ' on a privy with his face screwed up ? Well , that was the way the Yankee looked . He 'd run backwards and shove and twist forwards . Lacey follered him with a grin on his face , shoving hard on the bayonet till it came out the Yank 's back . The Yank keeled over with his hand still holding the bayonet  --  they were all bloody and cut to the bone . The constipated look came off his face , and he looked surprised . Lacey howled a wolfhowl , put a bare foot on the Yank 's belly and jerked the bayonet out through the cut hands . Lacey loved knives : he kept his bayonet whetted to a gnat 's heel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at night with a whetstone and his shoesole  --  when he had one  --  for a strop . He 'd git a glitter in his eye , like a poet or a fiddler , and he 'd test it with his fingernail . Purty , hai n't it ? he 'd say . The bluebelly 's legs drew up a little , and his head let loose of life and lolled over to one side . Lacey stood there with the bayonet , wipin ' it on a little rag . I needed them shoes , he said . I honed fur ' em . A little chunk of sour cornpone out of Jud 's vomit stuck on the nosep181of the Yank at our feet . Lacey was taking off his Yankee 's shoes . He was a-pullin ' like hell , for the man 's feet were still hot , summer infantry feet , swollen up like a hoptoad . He got ' em off and the socks too and swung ' em over his shoulder . Then he gave the Yankee a good goin ' over , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he walked over toward us . What 's the matteh , son , yore stummack weak ? Ganddamn ' if he didn ' puke in that bluebellie 's face . Now , ah wouldn ' stand theah like a bump on a log . Ah 'd git me some ca'tridges . Hisn 'll fit yore muskit . Gen'l Hill was a-sayin ' to me to'thah day  --  jist like Cunnel Zeb Vance usteh say : Ganddammit , Harrison , have I got to keep hackin ' at you men tuh git ca'tridges . Ah cai n't keep troublin ' Gen'l Lee about ca'tridges , when he 's got ole Joe Hookah an ' all the Yanks tuh whup . Lacey looked down and saw the shoes on our Yankee . By Gand , he said , I 'm gon na stock up on shoes . Kep ' tellin ' me we was gon na git some store shoes in Gettysbuhg yestiddy  --  ah allow we had tuh git us some Yankees fust . You stay away from that man 's shoes , Jud said . Ho ! ho ! Lacey said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his musket up and aimed it pint blank at Lacey 's belly . Lacey , he said , you git away from him or I 'll spill your guts out . My gun 's loaded and primed . Jud 's hands were trembling . Well , I 'll be a son of a bitch , Lacey said . Old Wagg came up from the branch in the little clearing where the water was red . He saw and heard . Lacey , Wagg said , you git ! Git oveh thar and wait till we form , er I 'll kill you now , so help me Gand , ah will ! Lacey walked off with a mean look in his eye . He 'd got only a little way when Jud fell over backwards . Sun 's hot . You take keer of yor brotheh , Pinckney . Th'ow some watah in his face and tote him in undah yon shade tree . Michigan , Jud said when he opened his eyes . I 'm goin ' to Michigan . What 'd he do , Pink ? What 'd that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He did n't do anything , Jud . Old Wagg just walked up and offered to kill him again . You got sun touched and Wagg told me to throw water in your face . Sun ? Jud said . I was scared , Pink  --  scared as hell . I was so scared when they stood there shootin ' at us this mornin ' , I stopped and remembered thinkin ' : I 'm froze like a rabbit now . They ca n't get me now . I 'm scared of that Lacey . I did n't blame him , Uncle Pink said . Lacey was n't hardly human ; pI82he looked like a good big chicken-hawk , or a turkey buzzard , or a Goddamn ' big carrion crow  --  or mebbe a mean starved timberwolf . He had a matted beard full of mites  --  and I never saw a man had a wickeder look in his eye . You could n't , in truth , call Lacey human . I do n't believe there was anybody in the regiment , except Ole Wagg , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor Lacey was afraid of anything . But Lacey was cruel and Wagg did n't have a mean bone in his body . I reckon he 'd a killed Lacey if he 'd had to  --  but only if he 'd a had to . That first day at Gettysburg was the first real war for Jud and me . You and I can sit here under the honeysuckle vine and talk about war ; and I can tell you how there were Yanks across the branch with loaded rifles in a field and how we had loaded rifles too . I can tell you how we went towards each other and started firing at each other  --  and how I saw boys and men bleeding at the mouth , the head , the breast ; with ankles shattered ; with legs blown off . There was one Yankee lad  --  I lay down near him , and he died while I was there without saying a word  --  with blood rolling out of his neck onto a fine white linen shirt . He made a gurglesound a little like my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still pink and white , and with his black hair , it made him look like Mary Ivy Dula , the girl that Jud wanted to spark back in Gadkin county . The blood kept dribbling down onto his kepi , which lay beside him , and coloring the white clovershaped corps badge on it . And I can tell you that I lay there thinkin ' : Damn ' if that boy do n't look like Mary Ivy Dula , while he got white and the shirt and cap got redder and he stopped gurgling . But there is something metaphysical , mebbe , about battle  --  something in the ether between the two armies . It is not a smell , or a look , or a taste , or a noise , or an emotion  --  it is something that you remember ( not all of it  --  not all complete , however ) for years . Maybe you remember the smell and the look and the feel and the taste and the noise , but they were thrown into you then and mixed up and jogged around as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pestle with something else , some X , being added  --  and you yourself and thousands of others being pounded into this mixture . No ; Uncle Pink said . It ai n't hate , fear , anger nor pride . It 's something else , Lee . It 's something curious and cruel  --  it 's something like that hillbilly brother-in-law of mine felt when he got a call while he was walkin ' along between the plowhannels . All of a damn sudden a man feels powerful strange . Hep183looks around him and says : This is the earth I walk on every day ; these are the trees that shade me ; there is the sun again  --  but where am I ? And , what in God 's name , am I ? The call comes to them walking between the plowhannels : It comes to them as it did to my brother , Joshua , who , in his licker , wrote a long poetic tract in Eighteen eighty-five on the Second Coming in Eighteen eighty-nine and printed it in Eighteen eighty-seven by mortgaging his farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have felt the way I did at Gettysburg on the first of July Eighteen sixty-three , or the way I have felt at sunset sometimes on this porch with the honeysuckle close to me and Grandfather Mountain far off over there . They had to  --  they just had to call it somethin ' , so they said it was God or The Call . Why , Lee , I reckon you do n't know yore Great Uncle Joshua had a conference with the Archangel Gabriel right in these very hills ? I did n't figure you 'd know . The tract on the Second Coming ai n't declasse , but that conference with old Gabriel up on Sourwood mountainsounded just a mite too much like a hillbilly preacher 's didoes for yore precious cousins . It was gittin ' too much like talkin ' in The Tongues  --  or the jerks . And yore cousins do n't go after God in such a lowborn way . They belong to the genteelest particle of the Methodist Church South . I heard one of ' em say Joshua 's tract on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an understandable slip in chronological calculations  --  ' cordin ' to their figgers it was due in Nineteen eightynine . But you can bet they never mentioned that Gabriel business . WE HAD roast pig to eat before Pickett 's Charge , Uncle Pink said . Wagg himself and Wheary , the sergeant-major , came in with three good sized shoats . Wagg carried two , one over each shoulder  --  a couple of hundred pounds at least  --  and Wheary had one on his back . Wagg sent some of the other men for the rest . You , Lacey , Wagg said , you and Dance Sudderth fotch me some fiahwood . We gon na have pohk . The tobacco juice trickled down into his fanshaped beard as he threw the pigs on the ground and took out his knife . He schlooped the tobacco juice up and hollered for water as he began to butcher the pigs . You thar , Jud , an ' you Pink ! Fotch me some watah , if yore studyin ' to set yore teeth in a juicy piece of pohk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaned about a dozen pigs , and put ' em on ramrods himself and seasoned ' em up and told Lacey and Sion how to keep the fires . He did n't let anybody tell him how to barbecue a pig . He cooked all that pigmeat himself and passed it out to the regiment . He had the whole passel of us under his wing , for Colonel Burleson and Lieutenant Colonel Lane , a pair of politicians from Yancey county , had been killed July first and . Major Dula had to he'p with the brigade . I think Pettigrew had the division . There was a Virginia battery near us  --  I remember now how the sun slanted through the trees on the Napoleon guns . The cannoneers were lying round the cannon on the burnt grass , looking toward the smell of the pork . One of ' em got up and sniffed and grinned and barked like a bitchfox . We all laughed  --  and Wagg said : This yere 's fur my boys yore , but any man can bahk that way gits a smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everybody hollered and even ole Lacey let out a screech like a buzzard . Wagg waddled around his spits catching the grease in fryingpans , smacking his lips as he tore off a little hunk of golden cracklin now and again and ate it down , or shoved it into the mouth of one of the men around him . He made Lacey mix up corn meal and pig grease and cook the pone , because Lacey was good at that . We were all standin ' around droolin ' at the mouth when a tall feller with dusty jackboots walked up to Wagg and saluted . He was slim with big bulging shoulders and one of the purtiest golden beards ever I saw  --  and like a little girl 's hair , all full of ringlets . He had on a brown cavalry hat with a black ostrich plume  --  the hat brim pinned back over the feathers with a gold Palmetto star . Ah 'll be dawg if it ai n't Jeb himse'f ! Dance Sudderth said . Lacey laughed in his screechy buzzardvoice . Wagg turned around that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the man said in a voice soft as rich fur . Yes , suh , Wagg said , looking up at the boyface under the Jeb hat . Wagg returned the man 's salute and spat , dribbling a little stream of homecured juice down a graystreak in his beard . Cap'n , ah lost mah hawss . Lacey screeched out another mean buzzard laugh . Lacey , Wagg said , close that trap a yourn . His bullvelvet neckp185moved his head back to the cavalryman with a nice ripple . You lost yore hawss , suh ? Wagg said . And mah rigiment too . Ah figgahed you might let me he'p with youah batt'ry heah . Ah use ' to he'p Majah Pelham  --  Well , suh , Wagg said , schlooping his tobacker juice in , yore laborin ' under a misapprehension . That batt'ry hai n't ourn . We ain ' hawss ahtillery er hawss cavalreh  --  we git around on shank 's mar ' . We fit on foot for three years . Suah you didn ' smell ouah pohk meat ? Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time . Well , Cap'n , ah cai n't say ah did n't smell it . But ah said to mahse'f , those men look like they could lick the hell outa one of Gen'l Wade Hampton 's beahs , so ah come ovah to inquiah if you needed any he'p . Ah thought you was ahtillereh by the cannon theah . Them thar 's Virginny cannon , Wagg said . What 's yore outfit , young man ? Wagg fumbled his tobacker farther back in his jowl . Jeff Davis Legion , Cap'n . Mah hawss was shot out from undah me at Fleetwood . Cap'n McGehee said to go find me anothah an ' ketch up with the rigiment . Ah found one , but he broke a leg last night runnin ' away from the Yankees . Ah had to shoot him . Ah cai n't find hide naw hair of mah command  --  an ' ah suhmised you might be willin ' to take on some extra he'p . Well , son , we ain ' hightone hawss cavalreh heah , but the ole Eighty-sixth Nawth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marched blue in the face . You from Virginny ? No , suh , Missi'ppi . Well , Wagg said , I reckin you kin holp . We was eight hunderd ' fore we hit Pennsylvany  --  I do n't reckin we got more'n three hunderd now . Wagg looked at Jud and me , then back to the cavalryman . What 's yore name an ' rank , young man ? Reese Eliot , suh . Private . Wagg grinned . You , Jud , and you , Pink ! Carreh this cavalrehman oveh to yon wagins and git him a Yankee muskit and some U. S. ca'tridges . Let me make you acquainted with Private Jud Harrington and Private Pink Harrington . It 's an honah , Reese said . Jud and me looked at him and then at each other . He was n't much older than either of us , Uncle Pink said , but he looked it . He was the kind of a boy that had been called Ole Reese since he was ten mebbe  --  the kind of a boy that looked strong and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wildest moments . One of the main things about Reese , Uncle Pink said  --  the thing that made Jud take to him like he did  --  was that he never said anything about Our Glorious Cause , and he never acted as if he knew anything you did n't . But he never seemed at loss as to what he was gon na do.  |p186Jud  and I got him between us and he walked along with us half like he was under our command and half like we were his hosts . He kicked along careless-like through the grass  --  and Jud and I noticed he had a pair of silver spurs jingling on his jackboots . We saw the sabre he wore was gold-hilted with a United States eagle on it and fine golawovetassels hanging from the hilt  --  and a sabretache dangled against his left jackboot . He had a big Colt 's revolver hung in a U. S. holster too . His uniform had been finer broadcloth than Jud 's and mine , but it was weathered and dirty and torn . Say , Jud said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reese smiled  --  he had the whitest teeth ever I saw . Suah have , he said . Gal gave it tuh me  --  lil of gal in Chahlottesville . Prettiest gal eveh I saw . Onleh trouble  --  she cai n't make up huh mind between me and Gen'l Stuaht . That 's a Yank sword too , I said . Did you capture it ? It 's mah fathah 's Mexican wah sword . He made me a presun ' of it . Was he in the cavalry too ? Jud said . No , Reese said . He was a majah in Cunnel Jeff Davis 's rigiment . Cunnel Jeff Davis made him a presun ' of it . I thought you said you were from Missi'ppi , jud said . Ai n't Charlottesvillein Virginia ? Suah is , Reese said . I was studyin ' at the Univuhsityof Vuhginia when the wah broke out . Oh , jud said , there was a boy from Caldwell there , Willie Fitchett . He 's in the First North Carolina cavalry too . Do you know him ? Fitchett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huhd the name . I swear , Uncle Pink said , Jud looked relieved . That Willie Fitchett came home to Gadkin county in the winter of Eighteen sixty-two after hawses and courted Mary Ivy Dula  --  all the time wearin ' around a hat with one of his ma 's old hat plumes in it . Those plumes in the hats of Stuart 's cavalry were n't so much ; a good many of ' em were nothin ' but tailfeathers out of a turkey or a Spanish rooster . Best one ever I saw was the one Reese was wearing . He did look the nearest thing to a knight ever I saw , Uncle Pinckney said . He had a light shelljacket , which looked as if it could n't be buttonedover the bulges of his shoulders and neck  --  but there was n't anythingbullish about him like there was about Wagg . I can see him still , kickin ' along with that sabretache slappin ' against his jackboot . I can see him reach up and sweep that Jeb Stuart hat off his head  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suah is hot ! he said. pI87It 's gon na be hottah foah the Yankees today though . Ah heah we gon na hit ' em this aftahnoon with the whole ahmy ! We ai n't heard it , I said . How do you know , Reese ? Jud said . Well , Reese said , ah been lookin ' foah the Jeff Davis Legion all mawnin ' , an all the men in Longstreet 's corps said they huhd Gen'l Lee was fixin ' to hit ' em with evehthing we got this aftahnoon . Ahtillereh was gettin ' readeh . Eveh gun was movin ' ! Now , if ah can just git me a good rifle , we can git in among ' em and whip the hell out of the Yankees , cai n't we ? Shore can ! Jud said . Why , that boy , yore grandfather , was plumb fascinated with Reese Eliot from the time he set eyes on him . Here was Old Reese , right out of the cavalry that Jud had longed to join , a University of Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air about him . And when Reese spoke of whipping the hell out of the Yankees , you could be sure that he did n't hold any personal malice . Uncle Pink 's tumefactive mass waggled in the blueveined skinsac behind his ear as if it were an egg about to hatch . Jud kept askin ' Reese questions : Where 'd you git that Yank pistol ? Reese pulled out the heavy Colt 's and handed it to Jud . Captured it , Reese said , at Fleetwood . Captured a cahbine too  --  a Shahp 's cahbine  --  but ah lost it when mah hawss was shot out from undah me . Yes suh ! Yankee rode right up tuh me shootin ' that pistol  --  so close he almost buhnt mah whiskahs . Reese chuckled sorter reminiscently , Uncle Pink said . Ah said , Mah Gand , man ! Suah is sorreh shootin ' ! He put the pistol away an ' stahted hackin ' at me with his sabah . Suah made it sing around mah head . Well , ah knocked him off his hawss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistol , cahbine , swohd , hawss an ' all . Ohdnance officah said : Look heah , Reese , you take this pistol an ' cahbine . You ai n't got any  --  an ' Gen'l Hampton told me to see you wuh all ahmed , if we had to disahm the whole Yankee ahmy to do it . So ah got me a new pistol an ' cahbine . Cahbine was a new breech-loadah too . Suah hated like hell to lose it . Mah hawss too . Pretty a bay as eveh you saw . Ah had him at ( Chahlottesville . That boy , Reese , Uncle Pink said  --  I do n't know as I eveh heard a voice like that again . I do n't know as eveh I saw as fine a boy . And yore grandfather  --  I do n't think he ever found a man in his life who could come up to Reese . And he kept at him . He had outa Reese how he had been on the cide around McClellan and how he saw the womenp188buryin ' Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oveh Gen'l Stuart . Why Reese even told him how he and Major von Borcke used to go out and shoot squirrel . Majah von Borcke suah likes his lickah too , Reese said . An ' you ought a see the swohd he totes  --  fo foot long ! He suttinly hannels it too . Ah saw him git in among some Yankees  --  an ' , be Ganddamned if he did n't cut two of theah heads off . No ! Jud said . Ah sweah to Gand ! Reese said . Those Prussians suah ah wile men ! All the time Jud was pumpin ' Reese , Uncle Pink said , we 'd been walkin ' along a ridge back through the woods . Pretty soon we came out into the sunlight of a wheatfield where the wagons were  --  two of ' em marked Eighty-sixth N. C. over the U. S. Near the wagons there was a Yankee field forge that had been captured somewhere  --  mebbe Fredericksburg . And there was one of those slim-barreled Whitworth guns standin ' gee-haw beside it with a broken axle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat , cookin ' a wad of cornpone on a piece of iron over a rock . The field was cut up with wagontracks . Jud and me got Reese a .58 calibre Springfieldmusket with U. S. arsenal marks and a hundred and fifty rounds of paper minie cartridges . Reese hefted the musket and laid a hand on Jud 's shoulder : Suah fixed us up for the Yanks , he said . Yes suh ! Yes suh ! Jud said , as near like Reese as he could make himself sound . I cai n't git that Whitworth gun outa my head , Uncle Pink said . It was a breech-loader  --  first one eveh I saw . Reese walked oveh to it and said : First one of these eveh I saw . Ain ' wuth a good Ganddamn ' ! the blacksmith said . He said it like he did n't care . He was the drawlyest feller eveh I heard talk . Spits out fiah behin ' and busts huh axle mighty neap eveh time she rars back . Give me a muzzle-loadah any day ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ britch-block as if it was a dawg . Yes suh , he said to Jud . They run ' em through the blockade from England . Ah read about ' em in the Richmond Examinah . Shoot fast and fah . Cannoneahs do n't like ' em , the blacksmith said . Hai n't reliarable . Ah patched this one up twice a'ready since we come to Pennsylvany . No suh , that piece ain ' wuth its hide'n tallah , the blacksmithsaid as Reese swung the block shut and twirled the closing screw . No suh , the blacksmith said like a preacher . Give me one of them brass Napoleon guns any day . You cai n't shell anything good under a mile away with this yere son of a bitch . He pointed to three Napoleons standing a little way from the Whit/worth . Take them guns thar  --  tuck ' em from the Yanks at the fust battle a Manassas , an ' been a-farm ' ' em eveh since an ' sahshayin " em all oveh hell an Vuhginny  --  an ' by Gand , ther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. arsenal . Well , Reese said , ah ai n't so much of a gunnah mahse'f . He snapped the new musket to carry and turned to Jud : Well , Cap'n , he said , shall we git back an ' tend to the Yankees . Yes suh , we 'll git back to the rigiment and whip the hell out of us a few bluebellies . The waggling of Uncle Pinckney 's encysted earegg stopped for a minute , Lee remembered , and he stared beyond the honeysuckle as if he were trying to see Reese and my grandfather again  --  as if he were trying to see the fields and trees in Pennsylvania where he had been in the summer of Eighteen sixty-three  --  and where he had never been since . I would have dearly loved to see that country again . Why , even now , I could go to Gettysburg and walk to where that Whitworth stood , and I could find the rock that the blacksmith was cookin ' his pone oveh . I can remember the walk back to the regiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run onto the buryin ' detail . They had a long shallow trench dug and were gatherin ' Southerner and Yankee alike . Some of ' em were stiff with their arms up in the air  --  they were fairly fresh kilt  --  and others were limp with their bellies swollen up with the deathgas in ' em  --  they were gittin ' black in the face . None of ' em had any shoes on . No sir ! We never buried a pair of shoes after Eighteen sixty-two that I can remember  --  and not many clothes . A couple of boys on the buryin ' detail picked up a dead Yankee with a belly full of gas  --  and he let out a big ughhh ! They dropped him . An old sergeant laughed like a rooster . Gand A'mighty , he said , that thar 's a dead Yank ! They lay in the shallow trench like you could stand ' em up and have a company front ready for action . Here and there was a board stuck up behind some openeyed boy  --  a name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood . I saw ' em begin to throw dirt in the eyes of those dead boys . I saw Orren Brabble dead with his eyes open and Drury Bugg and Old Jeems Marsh  --  all from Gadkin county . And they 'd all been alive on the second of July . Further on there was a trench filled in , but at one end , a forearm with a hickory shirt sleeve on was stickin ' up pointin ' at the hot sun . Why , Goddamn ' it ! I remember now . Orren Brabble got a cake from his mother and give a little piece of it to every one of us in the company  --  a mere sliver  --  and took the smallest sliver for himself . You could hear ' em yellin : Baaattery ! F000rward ! in the heat from behind the ridgetop  --  and you could hear the sound of the batteries moving like a lot of springless wagons on a hot lazy summertime street . And as Jud and me and Reese walked back to the regiment , there were flies and bees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ridgetop we could see dozens of cannon limbered and movingand get the rattle and jingle of ' em as if we were listening to an approaching circus parade on a hot day when we were little boys . I remembered how Jud and me had seen Captain Ivy 's North Carolina battery swing down the main street in Caldwell , jingling and smart , with Ivy at the head on a fine black horse and a lot of men we knew in gray uniforms sitting up on the caissons and riding the horses  --  appearing to us half as strange romantic soldiers and half as boys we knew on the roadside or in spring wagons or loafing at the store  --  boys who had no right to turn into soldiers riding beside the limbered , shiny , brazen guns , who had no right to go out and do the things which were done in books and in our own heads as we lay belly down in the grass . Jud and me were the only soldiers . I was the only captain  --  major , colonel , general , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of them the worthless , shif'less critters that our father had told us they were  --  dubbed knights under our noses ! Old Clay Morris , settin ' up on a caisson , peart as a jaybird . Was n't he hardly any better than the most lowdown , no'count white trash in Gadkin county ? Did he ever own even one nigger ? We could see the cannon coming into battery , the sun glaring on the barrels , the cannoneers digging in , the horses being picketed . Look theah ! Reese said . Theah 's anothah Whitworth breech-loadah . Suah gittin ' ready to shell the hell out of ' em . He pulled a twist of tobacker out of his shelljacket . Have a chew , he said to Jud . I knew that the only time Jud had eveh tried to chew he got sick as a cat , but he bit off a piece of the homecured . Yes suh , Reese said , weah suah gon na throw some iron on ' em . He laughed , pleased as Punch . Weah suah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , I had a chew too , Uncle Pink said . But I knew how . Anyway , Judson and me felt as if we and Reese were blood brothers  --  and the whole Army of Northern Virginia to boot.  |p191I  watched the oscillation of Pinckney Harrington 's tumefactive caregg : Like some captive Humpty Dumpty , it seemed to sit , wagging slyly and whispering all the time , behind my uncle 's ear : No great falls for us any more , Pinckney ! We 're purty sly fellers , Pink . I sot hyear with you a right smart time , Pink , and you and me knows we ai n't a-gittin ' up nowheres jist to fall off an ' bust our head . Uncle Pink stuck his hand behind his ear and gently drove a spring fly from the damp skinshell of his tumescent companion . The ground , Uncle Pink said , the look of the ground comes back to me now : The still unburied swollen dead , men and hawses , lay all over the fields below the ridge ; and underneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , books , jackets , bayonets and all of that which is always called the debris of the armies . Ourn was n't much account I 'm here to tell you : by Eighteen sixty-three even the officers did n't have many pair of handmade boots and silvermounted pistols  --  and damn ' few of the soldiers had anything but camp-made rawhide moccasins . When Jud and me got back to camp with the recruit , Wagg and Abner Snead , who was one of the handiest butchers in Gadkin county , were cutting up the meat . Wheary was he'ppin ' : Here ye air , boys , Wagg kept sayin ' . Go right tuh it . The men had pigmeat skewered on bayonets , bowie knives and jack knives . Harrison Lacey and Jim Poe were fryin ' the pone oveh the fire  --  and somebody had gethered in all the coffee everybody had . The muskets were stacked in a kind of a square around the men to keep off raids on the grub . The flag leant against one of the musketstacks : it was blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and full of holes . But it was silk . The red field had the battles sewed on in strips : Seven Pines , Gaines 's Mill , Malvern Hill , Oak Grove  --  Eighty-Sixth North Carolina Infantry . Colonel Burleson 's wife made it . Brother Sion was settin ' cross-legged on the ground beside the flag , in a walnut-dyed Yankee zouave jacket and a pair of butternut homespun britches , eatin ' pigmeat  --  but not very hearty . I remember hearin ' Lige Boggs honin ' fur collard greens and molasses . He had eyes like a couple of hackberries and a gray goatbeard . Hyear you , Pink and Jud , Wagg said , fotch thet hawss solger oveh hyear . We livin ' high ! Cai n't whup the Yankees on an empty belly , can ye , Cap'n Albright ? Albright was captain of the Yancey county company . He was big and bar'lchested as Wagg and red inp192the face . He had a short black beard and looked like he 'd been weaned on cawn licker . The sweat was runnin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost like a bird at the pigmeat . Shore cai n't , he said gently . Shore nough cai n't . Well , Uncle Pink said , Jud and me got Reese between us  --  he would n't go ahead  --  and led him up to Captain Wagg 's barbecue . Go tuh it , boys ! Wagg gave us three extry large and choice hunks of pig . Cai n't hev you a-goin ' back to Jeb Stuaht a'sayin ' the Nawth Cahtuia foot cavalreh cai n't tek keer of its guests , Wagg said . Thank you , Captain Wagg , Reese said touching his plumes . Ah cai n't see thar 's any call to feed the cavalreh hyear , Lacey said . Lacey , Wagg said , that 'll do ! Mistah Eliot ouah guest  --  and we do n't study eveh to let a guest of the ole Eighty-six go hongry  --  do we men ? Everybody said yore Ganddamn ' right we did n't . And Wagg said : Lacey , I 'm right down ashamed of you . I ' clah , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then Ole Wagg straightened up and looked all around him severely and pompously . His eyes stopped on Lacey . All of us looked at Lacey . And , Wagg said , Colonel Buhleson not tole in his grave  --  mebbe not even buhied . Wagg schlooped and dribbled a trickle of yaller tobacker juice into the gray streak on his beard . He spluttered some with his mouth when he got angreh . Lacey , wheah 's yore mannahs ? Lacey shore looked like a sulky buzzard . He parted them whiskers a hisn and said : I did n't aim to be ornery , Cap'n . You could see Reese was flustered . Jud blushed , but Reese got a-holt of himse'f . Thank you , Cap'n Wagg , he said . Ah 'm suttinly honohed to be a guest of the Eighty-sixth Nawth Cahlina  --  ah 'm honahed to be able to he'p . We too are honahed , suh , Wagg said . He 'd been a mountain schoolteacher once  --  and he had a mighty queer set of company manners . But nobody felt like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then all of us let go with a Rebel yell except Lacey  --  and Sion . Sion just sat oveh there by the flag starin ' at the ground . We were still eating when all that ahtillery Jud and Reese and me had seen going into battery cut loose . A young staff officah on a hawss rode up and hollered : Who 's in command heah ? I am , suh ! Wagg hollered back . Have some bahbecued pohk ? You could n't hear very well , but you could see everybody was laughing . Wagg waddled upp193to the officer with some ribs on the end of his sword . Compliments of the Eighty-sixth Nawth Cahlina , Wagg yelled  --  Pennsylvany hawgmeat . Took it ? Uncle Pink said . I hope to tell you he took it ! When Wagg held it up to him on the end of that sword , he just changed from a man into a watery mouth . He took it and tore off a hunk and yelled with his mouth full . This is Gen'l Pettigrew 's brigade  --  ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wagg said . It was Cunnel Buhleson 's regiment day before yesterday , but it 's mine now . Well , Cunnel , the officer yelled with another mouthful of pohk . Cap'n , Wagg hollered . Cap'n Elisha Wagg , Twenty-sixth Nawth Cahlina Troops ! The man on the hawss hollered : I got to find Gen'l Pettigrew . Have your regimentready to move at a moment 's notice . Yes , suh , Wagg answered . Gen'l Pettigrew 'll be that way . The courier rode off chewing Wagg 's pork . Wagg went over to what was left of the last pig , picked up a spare bone and began to chew at it  --  but there was n't anything to speak of on it . Must 've been forty men rushed up to him with their pork held out for him to take . Wagg stood there bewildered . Git , Wagg said , I et a whole pig while it was cookin ' . Well , Uncle Pink said , his voice trembling a little , he had n't done a thing of the kind  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think he 'd touch a morsel ? He would n't ! But he damn ' near had teahs in his eyes , boy . He stood theah with that bullneck up in the air , his eyes a-waterin ' . He kept chewin ' the pig bone he had and sayin ' : By Gand , boys , we ai n't gon na fohm till we finished ouah pig . Jud and me took Reese oveh to Sion and introduced him . We were sorter proud of Sion , for he was color sergeant and had been at Seven Pines  --  and Old Wagg said Sion 'd saved his life at Malvern Hill . Wagg got the regiment formed in two lines an ' said : Set down whur you are , men . Soon as we git the order we can git up . Jud and me and Reese were beside each other . I saw Old Wagg take a Bible out of his pocket and walk over under a tree , moving his lips as he read to himself . Captain Albright walked off to one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching an ant struggling with a little piece of pork in the grass . The owl foah all his feathuhs was a-cold , Reese said . I didn't know it was Keats then , Uncle Pink said . Ah had me a pet owl once , Reese said . Suah had feathuhs . He had foh layahs of feathuhs ! Did he ? Jud said . We were all gittin ' nervous . For a while I could n't figure out what it was . Then I looked over at the battery of Virginia Napoleons . They were n't firing . The quiet . That was what was gittin ' us . It was hot and quiet and there was n't even a breath of air . It was so still you could sit there and study the ground or your musketlock or the man 's coat who was next to you down to the smallest detail as if you were at home in the afternoon lying on the ground under a shade tree , or out with some scientific expedition that had all the time in the world  --  only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead Pennsylvania bee in the grass and wishing for some sourwood honey . There was n't even a musketshot . I wo n't ever forget Sion walkin ' across to us with the flag in the leather socket on his belly . The flag was hanging down slack on the pole ; and he walked slow as if he was walking in his sleep . He came up to Jud 's feet . Heah , Jud , he said , handing Jud a package made of an old Charlotte newspaper , you keep this ; it gits in the way of my flaghelt . He did n't give Jud a chance to say nothin ' . Just marched off with the flag , and as he walked away , a little breeze caught the silk and spread it out holes and all against the summer sky . I could see Malvern Hill and N.C. on it . Mebbe it was because yore Uncle Sion was totin ' the flag  --  mebbe it was because I was young , but I looked at that flag and felt my throat git full . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reese looked at it and smiled . He had a little book of Keats 's poems in his hand . Squirrel 's got a whole crib full of nuts , he said . Gon na have lots of good juiceh nuts foah wintah . Sit around the fiah and crack himse'f all the nuts he can eat . He laughed softly . Just eat the hell out of ' em . Suah would like a good cig-gah . He sighed . Now LEE , Uncle Pinckney said to me , flipping his blueveined earegg with two fingers , mark what I tell you , boy ! I heard the two guns of the Washington Artillery that started the greatest cannonade the worldp195had ever known up to the twentieth century  --  the signal guns . They went off almost at once . Then they began that long scudding roll ; and the ridges and the hills roared and shook . I could see the Virginia battery laying the weeds flat in front of their muzzles . Over on the opposite hill where the Yanks were , puffs of white smoke began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring ; the gullies and draws echoed . Reese leant over between Jud and me : Wish you and Pink and me had that britch-loadin ' Whitworth we saw this mornin ' . We could suah pick us off a Yank or two ! He looked over toward Cemetery Ridge . I 'll bet you we hit ' em with the whole Ganddamn ' ahmy ! A thunderstorm ? Uncle Pink said . Well , you could call it that . You do n't feel the ground shake under yore feet  --  and the thunder does n't keep up all the time  --  and the hot air does n't smell like burnt gunpowder . When it quit finally , it was n't as if something big had happenedand was over and done with . No . Everybody knew that the cannonade was nothin ' but part of what was goin ' to happen . Wagg came out from undah the tree with the Testament in his hand and waddled out in front of us : And the Lawd said unto Jeremiah , Wagg said : Out of the NAWTH an evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ah will call all the families of the Kingdoms of the Nawth , saith the Lawd ; and they shall c : me , and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem , and against all the walls thereof roundabout , and against all the cities of Judah . Thou , therefore gird up thy loins , and arise , and speak to them all that commandthee : be not dismayed at theah faces , lest ah confound thee befo ' them . And they shall fight against thee , but THEY SHALL NOT prevailagainst thee ; fo ' ah am with thee , saith the Lawd , to delivah thee . See that ridge oveh there ! Wagg hollered . The gates of Jerusalem ! Gird up thy loins ! I can see Wagg standin ' yonder , Uncle Pink said , with the sun on that ole black hat and blackgreen frockcoat with the swordbelt pinchin ' into the bullmeat on his belly so 's it hung oveh in a roll . He unfastened the old Confederate web holster with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest and heaviest pistol in the Army of Northern Virginia . We use ' to call it Ole Wagg 's field piece , or Ole Wagg 's twelve pounder , or Ole Wagg 's Bull Pistol . Let the pig settle good , Wagg said . We got ordahs to dress on Gen ' 1 Archah , an ' he ai n't up yet . Let the pig dygest  --  and remembah what the Lawd said unto Jeremiah . Majah Dula is goin ' to ride with the regiment  --  but I 'm not goin ' to ride . I 'm gon na walk right along with you and holp you whup the Yankees . Gird up thy loins ! Everybody let out a Rebel yip  --  till Wagg stopped ' em . And Jud and Reese and me could see Sion movin ' our flag through the air to the end of our line . Behind us there were hoofbeats : I suppose the staff officers and couriers were gettin ' everything ready . It seemed like a long time since the cannonade . I heard somebody say  --  might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that clump of timbah near Seminarry Ridge oveh thar . Somebody else answered . Hell 's far , this yere 's SeminarryRidge  --  that thar 's Cemitarry Ridge oveh thar . Then Lige , if ' twuz him , answered : It do n't make a damn  --  it 'll be Cemitarry Ridge fo ' the Yankees whureveh we ketch ' em . You could see the line of skirmishers go out . They did n't look much , Uncle Pink said , just little gray brown spots movin ' across the open field on a hot day . Even when the musketfire started , it was n't much after that cannonade  --  and there was a good deal of smoke and dust in the air , so 's you could n't see anything plain . I was thirsty fore we eveh started . I could look oveh and see the Yanks and a few cannon on their ridge . Reese was standing there with that Jeb Stuart plume stirring in a hot wind . What 'd I tell you ? he said . Old Man 's suah gon na hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Pennsylvania tonight . Next to Jud in line Lacey was standin ' , quiverin ' like a mad dawg . That mean buzzardeye of hisn was meaner than ever I saw it  --  he was lookin ' up at that honed-up bayonet . I remember thinkin ' his ole hat looked as if it had laid on the ground all through the spring rains and then had the dirt dried into it by the sun . You wanta hold onto that pigmeat you et today , he said to Judson . I could see Jud 's face was white as yore shirt , Uncle Pink said ,  --  but I reckon mine was too . Some more cannon had opened : and Jud would blink now and again and close his eyes tight for a second or two . Up the line back of us I could hear a hawss galloping . Then I saw Pickett 's men begin to move out onto the fields below . Pickett 's Charge . Whenever you hear about it you think of a big army , maybe on horseback , rushing across a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muskets and hollering like hell  --  all happening in the clear air , so that you can see ' em cutting down the enemy and the enemy shell breaking in among ' em . Well , it was n't like that : you could n't see much : A good number of men walkin ' in a fairly straight line across a smoky dustyp197field  --  a red flag now and again and the line gittin ' crookeder all the time . Somebody said the regimental bands played  --  but I never heard anything but guns . I saw a battery galloping forward across the field once that day  --  bouncing and kicking up the dust  --  but even that when you 're far from it does n't look like much . It ai n't fast ! But that did n't matter . We felt something big was fixin ' to happen . We got the order over the hot air . Forwaand ! It seemed lazy and fur away  --  even when Wagg hauled out his sword and stood out in front of us and bellowed : Fohwand  --  Maahch ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up the line and saw Sion 's flag : once I read Seven Pines on it and Malvern Hill . Heah we go ! Reese said . Heah we go , Jud ! Heah we go , Pink ! Gon na lick the hell outa the whole damn ' Yankee ahmy ! We marched along easy except for the dead men and hawses and our own guns we had to march through  --  those cannoneers shore looked tired and dirty . Lot of ' em were sittin ' on the guntrails panting like they had just finished a hard race . But they hollered out at us as we went past  --  some of ' em even waved their hats . There was one bunch of dead hawses we went past : they looked like wooden hawses the way their legs stuck out . Keep closed up , Wagg hollered . An ' remembah what the Lawd Gand said to Jeremiah ! After a little way you could look around , Uncle Pink said , because it was such a long walk in the hot sun to the Yankee lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water and wondah what was gain ' to happen . You could look up and down the line and wondah if that part oveh there had hit the Yankees yet . For a while I thought the bayonets looked like a tall steel picketfence in the sun . You could walk along and figgah : I got me a Yank in front of me comin ' at me with his bayonet . I ca n't shoot him , because I just fired . Shall I jump outa his way and come in and stick him from the side , or shall I knock his bayonet to one side and stick him from the front , or shall I mash in his head with a clubmusket ? Supposin ' he gits me fust ? Supposin ' I tuhn and run  --  and he sticks me in the back ? And I kept thinkin ' , if it was n't so damn ' hot and I had a drink , I would n't really mind gittin ' kilt . Look theah , Reese hollered . By Gand ! theah 's an officah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I saw him , Uncle Pink said ,  |p198but  I could n't think at the time what Reese was laughin ' at . Fur as I was concerned a whole battalion of overcoats in July would n't have surprised me then . It was General Dick Garnett . He was just out of an ambulance and still sick , but he rode in with the men in his old Union army overcoat . I do n't think I had eveh seen him before and I never saw him after . He was killed that day . I waited until Eighteen eighty-seven to find that out in a piece in the Century Magazine . The man was sick , buttoned up in a blue Yankee overcoat , on July third  --  a hot July third  --  riding into what he knew was almost certain death . My Gand ! Uncle Pink said . Who remembers Gen'l Dick Garnett now ? Who remembers anybody but Lee and Jackson and Grant and Sherman ? We kept on walkin ' , Uncle Pink said , in a long line . I could hear a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't make out what it was . Then it dawned on me . Why , by Gand , I said to myself , it must be our feet . We 're pickin ' ' em up and settin ' down . Ten thousand pair of feet , thinks I  --  that 'd be twenty thousand feet . Be a good many wo n't make any noise after today . Some men hollered , but I could n't make out what they said . I quit listenin ' to the feet and I heard maybe a battery limbered  --  it had a lumbery sound like a springless wagon , but it jingled like -a battery . The dust got thicker , but nothin ' seemed to happen except we was goin ' for a walk . Just a damn ' fool walk in the sun when we could 've been lyin ' under a tree asleep . I looked up toward the opposite ridge and saw smoke break loose . It must have hit the line about ten , fifteen foot to the right of me , for there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside me . Down at the end of the line I caught a glimpse of Sion with the flag  --  opened out and rippling slow on the hot air . I could see the holes and still all the names of the battles . Now that they had us out in the middle of the field , the Yankees opened right up with their cannon . Another solidshot or a shell that did n't explode hit Abner Snead in the right leg and tore it off . The blood spattered on Jud and Reese . Behind Abner a diagonal line of men went down  --  maybe six . Lige Boggs  --  Lacey said later  --  got that solidshot or unbursted shell in his belly . It went clear through him and rolled and skipped away on the field as Lige lay bloody and flopping with his guts spillin ' out  --  but already dead , like a chicken with its head cut off . I saw Abner jump up from the ground and hop up andp199down on the leg he had left . He hollered once , then he fell oveh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he toppled oveh . Ole Wagg was still out in front . Close up ! he hollered . Remembah Jeremiah ! He walked along backwards . You know what I can rememberabout him ? Uncle Pink 's eyes looked away back on Dixie that time , Lee said . I can remember how his belly was cut into with that belt and how it joggled up and down every backwards step he took . He put his hand up to his mouth and hollered loud : Come out hyear , Sion ! Come out hyear with the cullahs ! I saw Sion run out with the flag jerkin ' and pullin ' the hot air above him . Goes youah brothah with the cullahs ! Reese said . I looked at Cemetery Ridge one minute and saw the Yankees and guns , and I looked the next minute and nothin ' but smoke with red far flashes comin ' out of it . All of ' em seemed to be pointed at us . The dust from our own feet got thicker and thicker , but I could see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cough from dust and smoke . They war n't usin ' any solidshot now  --  canister and grape was breakin ' all around us . It got so thick I could n't tell how close we were gittin ' to the ridge  --  but my legs felt as if they were climbing . I could get glimpses of Wagg walkin ' backwards out in front : I could see him twistin ' that bullneck of hisn to look oveh his shoulder . And I could see Sion 's flag beside him and , now and then , Sion walkin ' along as straight as he could oveh the holes that the Yanks had kicked up in the field . Reese and Judson were still near  --  and I caught Lacey 's buzzardface out of the corner of my eye . I saw the railfence then , Uncle Pink said . It was ' longside a road . There was a few of our boys behind it shootin ' at the Yankees . I saw one man plain , lyin ' on his back bitin ' a cartridge  --  I saw him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ole Wagg and Sion were , almost at the railfence when I saw hit happen . I saw Brothuh Sion 's head neah the flagstaff one second  --  and them the next I saw the flagstaff and flag and all the names of the battles . marchin ' along beside Wagg with no head near it . I saw Sion walkin ' " along beside Wagg  --  at attention  --  without any head , totin ' the flag , It 's in the smoke , thinks I. I 'll see all of him in a minute . I even shut my eyes and opened ' em quick to clear away the cobwebs  --  but there was Sion , still walkin ' along a little ahead of Wagg , who was still waddlin ' along backwards . I even recognized Sion 's shoulders . I saw his hands still on the flagstaff . He 's lookin ' down , thinks I. He 'll throwp200back his head in a minute . But he did n't . He must have marched six steps , before Wagg caught the flag and waved it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't remember running myse'f . One minute I thought I heard Captain Albright holler : Close up ! Next I was with Jud and Reese lookin ' down at Sion . The blood was spurting out of his neck and I could see the gray of his windpipe  --  and his adam 's apple workin ' . I kept thinking ' : That 's Sion , all right . I know those shoulders and back like a book  --  like I know the road from Caldwell to Blowin ' Rock . But there was n't any head at all . Jud looked like a froze rabbit then all right . He did n't even move until Reese put a hand on his arm . Come on Jud , boy , Reese said . Let 's you and me git us some Yanks . He looked peart , all right , Uncle Pinckney said . He held that heavy musket as if it was a light stick of kin'lin ' wood . Jud started on with him . Harrison Lacey had taken the flag from Wagg . Wagg was hollering : Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inhabitants of the Land ! Oveh the fence , boys ! Git the Ganddamn ' niggerlovin ' bluebellies . They got little Sion ! RemembahZeb Vance and ale Nawth Cahlina  --  but hol ' yore fiah till we git oveh ! That was whar the heaviest Yankee musketfire started . The minnie balls began to whistle and the railfence shed splinters like a sawmill . Wagg and Lacey were running toward the fence screaming . Reese and Jud were right after ' em . I think I saw Dance Sudderth and James Poe and Wheary . Wagg had put up his sword  --  he had a musket . I must have run after ' em . I got across the fencerails  --  or they were knocked down . Reese and Dance Sudderth and Jud and me were firing into a Union battery behind a low stone wall . When we began to load , I saw Reese slump down behind the wall and thought they 'd got him for a minute  --  but then I saw him jerk Jud down to the ground . I lay down to load too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie down ; he fell over easy with the blood shooting out of the left side of his neck . Over to the left outside the stone wall , I saw a thick line of Yanks with muskets . Oh , I was n't afraid now . I 'd begun to git used to it . Nothin ' seemed to matter . I saw Jud and Reese roll over on their backs to finish loading  --  Jud was bitin ' cartridgeas calm as if it was target practice . Reese got up crouching . Wagg was still on his back ramming home a cartridge . Lacey had the flag/Istaff in one hand and was shooting a pistol into a Yankee near a cannon . There were a good many Confederates comin ' up behind us when the Yankees burnt into us with a round of canister . I got blood in my face and heard Reese yell : Canistah ! By Gand , canistah ! Save that bullet in youah rifle . Let 's git oveh the wall and in among ' em . Wagg was right near us : Eighty-six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil shall break fo'th ! Rally hyear ! He pointed to Lacey and the flag . Git the Ganddamn ' bluebellied bastuds . Little Jud ! You , Pink ! An ' the cavalreh ! Oveh the wall , boys ! Give ' em the cole steel ! I can see Ole Wagg trot up to that wall and climb it like a bar on a rock . He stood up on the wall and aimed at and shot a man who was about to pull the lanyard of a Napoleon . Then he jumped down on the other side like a ton of brick . I remember his bullmeat shivered with the shock . Lacey was beside him with the flag . Looked to me like all the Yanks ' faces ever I saw that day did n't have no more expression than a turnip or a stick of kin'lin ' wood . My hands were skinned and bleeding  --  I must 've skinned them on the stone wall , but I never knew how it happened . James Poe and Wheary were comin ' over the wall and Reese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yankee ahtillerymen ramming what looked like a double charge of grape into a Napoleon gun . Reese killed one with his musket and Wagg beat the other over the head with his clubbedmusket . I heard it hit like whalin ' a sack of meal with a piss-ellum club. just about that time I saw a Yankee ahtillery officah walkin ' up to Jud . The Yank had a little squashed cap on with a white shamrock on it . He had a wooden Injun look on his face and a heavy Colt 's in his hand . He was fixin ' to shoot Jud . I pulled up my musket and started to fire , but Jud got his up and jerked the trigger with one motion . The Yank was powerful close . His pistol went off in the air as he went over backwards . Looked as if he jumped up  --  mebbe he was blowed up  --  off the ground . There was a big hole in his blue ahtillery jacket . The edges of the hole were burnin '  --  and his bare hide looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood in the middle of the explosion . I saw all that , Uncle Pink said , before the Yankee went oveh backwands and hit the ground . The Yankee infantry kept comin ' in from the left and rolled usp202up . Lacey had stuck the flag of the Eighty-sixth in the ground , and he and Wagg were trying to turn the Napoleon , which the two Yanks had been loading . The rammer was still in the muzzle . Split  --  mebbe by a minnie ball  --  it looked forked , like a snake 's tongue . Wagg 's back arched like a plowhawss and the gun swung around on the Yanks . Reese ran around to the lanyard . Wagg and Lacey stepped aside , and Wagg yelled : Fiah ! Reese jerked the lanyard . It went into ' em canister , rammer and all  --  it was a Gand 's wonder the bar'l did n't break . Wagg picked up another rammer and Jud and me got canister . Wagg and Lacey rammed in another charge just as the Yankees closed up and came on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he pulled the lanyard again . They were right up on the gun . That charge blew at least two Yankees in two  --  and the legs and heads off a couple . I saw something light on the ground mebbe ten yards away . I think it was an arm . But they kept closing in : Wagg was beating ' em off with the rammer ; and Lacey was slashing around with that sharp bayonet . Gand ! Uncle Pink said . I saw him rip the mouth out of one Yankee boy  --  and he had a grin on his face while he did it . But that kind of thing could n't last long . There were too many comin ' up . I saw Jud poke with his bayonet , pull back and put his foot against a Yankee and pull again . The Yankee grabbed the bayonet with his hand , like that one had done with Lacey . Lacey was tearing the flag off the pole . Then , suddenly , I saw Reese : He had his father 's Mexican war sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders looked likely to bust his jacket any minute  --  and they swelled up when he brought the sword down and threw it back again , time after time . Two Yankees went down under it with their heads and shoulders bleeding . He stood there restin ' for a little spell , his jacket crept up and tight across those shoulders , the buttons open careless and his plumed hat jammed down oveh his ears . Then he hollered at Jud : Come on , Jud ! Let 's git back ! Now , Union batteries were galloping along the crest of the ridgenear the cemetery . I could see a few bewildered-lookin ' Confederatesclimbin ' back oveh the wall . We started to run , Reese and Jud andLacey . I stumbled oveh a dead hawse 's legs , and Reese picked me up . The hawses were in heaps  --  dead and wounded  --  and so were the men . Time we got to the wall there were right many climbin ' oveh . Wegot oveh and to somewhere ' longside that railfence that had n't beenp203knocked oveh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! We threw ourselvesdown and wriggled through on our bellies . Then we crouched and ran a piece . We almost fell down and lay flat , panting . We could hear ourselves panting . There was n't much musketry or cannonading now . A lot of legs passed by us just walkin ' slow . Jud still had a grip on his musket and he was coughin ' . I had mine too and , for the first time , I noticed the bayonetblade was bloody . Reese 's father 's swordblade was right under my nose . It was hot and bright in the sun where the dirt was n't stuck in the blood on it . Sticking out of Lacey 's coat was the Malvern Hill on the flag . In his right hand he had Ole Wagg 's Bull Pistol and in his left a stone . He 'd lost his sharp bayonet . We saw somethin ' movia ' near us . I grabbed onto my musket harder , until I saw what it was : It was a man settin ' up . He pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old brown slouch hat on the back of his head . He had tears in his eyes . Before Gand , , boy , Uncle Pink said , I neveh hope to see anything worse . Below the man 's nose there was n't any face . His lower jaw was gone and you could see his open throat  --  there was n't even any tongue . But the palate was there twitchin ' around in a great bloodoozyhole with powdersmut on the white skin around it . From the hair and the look of what face there was left , it was a boy of about sixteen  --  worst thing about it his eyes looked familiar . The eyes looked at me study ; and the tears run down into the bloody hole . He pointed to my musket and then back to himself . I could n't move . Reese saw him and began to load the Yankee Colt . He capped a nipple , cocked the hammer , took the pistol by the barrel and got up . Come on , he said . Le 's git back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he came up with us . We just walked back ; we could n't run . Well , we suah hit ' em anyway , Reese said . It was a strange part of Seminary Ridge  --  not where we started from  --  Uncle Pink said . Men were comin ' back just like we were . They all looked bewildered . There were some officahs on hawses  --  one with a redjacket and queer hat . One of ' em in a plain shabby gray uniform rode out to us . He had a Vandyke beard like yore grandfather use ' to wear . I knew him in a minute , even if I 'd never seen him before . It was Lee . Nobody could mistake him . By Gand ! You could feel him . It was all my fault , he said . We must all stand together now , to save the rest . I did n't say anything , but Lacey came : p hollering : Look Gen'l Lee ! he hollered , and ripped the flag out of his jacket . I saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Old Man took off his hat . That was what they called Pickett 's Charge , Uncle Pink said . ROME went to Kansas first in the early spring of sixtynine , I think , Wagnal said . Then he came back home to Knoxville and sold off everything ; the house , the land and the livery stable and paid the note or the loan or whatever it was . I never had any doubt that Clint got the ten thousand dollars . Una had about ten thousand left of the Mississippi money . They must have borrowed five from the bank of a political brigadier friend in Keokuk , for Una gave a party for the man and his wife just before she and Clint left for Washington . Hmm ! Katherine said . It 's money Una wants there . Catch Una wining and dining a Burlington banker after she knows Clinton is General Grant 's new Secretary of War ! That made the total about twenty-five thousand , cash in hand  --  and , of course , there was always credit in Washington for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in Burlington when Rome took his family to Kansas . How Mrs. Hanks , first , and Myra , next , found out about Rome 's loan or endorsement , I never knew . But they found out : Myra told Katherine : Mamma 's health ai n't too good , Myra said . And Papa and General Clint made a bad investment . I guess General Clint lost a lot of money too . Oh God , Katherine said , Una ! She 'll spend it for clothes from Paris . Is n't there anything you can do , Thomas ? Maybe she spent it for clothes , but it was not enough for Una . And poor Rawlins had T.B. , Wagnal said . Maybe , if he had lived , Old Grant  --  as empty and childlike a son of chance as he was  --  maybe , if Rawlins ( one political brigadier who believed the solemn speeches he made ) had lived , Grant would n't have become the comicp205pawn that he became as President of the United States . But I heard that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tents of the Army of Tennessee and feeling the warmth of heart that always comes too late , perhaps never comes except in retrospect  --  made him Secretary of War . Solemn , portentous , sententious old Rawlins . He was a fair grape of wrath all right and ought to have delivered the Sermon on the Mount or saved souls under a tent . It was said that he used to stick his hand in his coat Napoleonwise and walk sentry-like before his tent after Shiloh , repeating A Man 's a Man for A ' That . That was what Unconditional Surrender Grant 's brains did for relaxation . But he died . Clint sent Grant a short telegram of condolence , signing himself Brevet Major-General Clinton Belton , Army of Tennessee . ( Una composed it . ) Grant was touched : those cigars and maybe those sub rosa nips of brandy or Bourbon that Clint had got down Grant 's gullet without Rawlins finding out  --  and Una 's mothering in Burlington . What was more natural than to appoint Clinton Belton Secretary of War  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bivouacs of the Army of Tennessee to him . He did not know that he was appointing Una . Clint went to Washington , but Una , feeling , I suppose , that she had been marooned so long among the uncivilized yokels of Burlington that she needed to replenish her arsenal , sailed for Paris . The Burlingtonpapers copied the New York World when she returned four months later . The society reporter said that Worth , himself , had retiredto a cave and fasted for seven days before he created Mrs. Belton'snew wardrobe : Gold wheat-ears embroidered on green satin  --  forty pairs of shoes . Mrs. Sprague , the reigning belle of Washington , was dethronedAh , Katherine would say , Una 's enjoying herself at last . From now on she 'll make ' em squirm . She 'll be in the White House before she leaves Washington , if someone she 's trodden on does n't kill her . Her pretty neck would snap like an icicle . We were both born with cauls , Kitty said  --  but it was still as death and clammy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it thundered and the dogs howled and Mammy said her husband saw three tall men , ten feet tall , in long coats and stovepipe hats lying dead across the turnpike . But the night Una was born , Mammy said she saw something in the sky over the house  --  butp206she would never tell what it was . And whenever anyone mentioned it her eyes rolled up in her head as if she were a dead woman . She said the dogs lay down and trembled without howling and a pet chicken died on her cabin steps . Grandfather never liked Una : he never abused her as he did me . He never made her drink tea instead of coffee because he liked tea himself ; he never made her read lewd books , as he did me , to instruct me in the ways of designing and destructive doxies . He was always polite and ceremonious with her . Once , in his cups , he said to me : There 's your sister , my fine little wench , as coldhearted a whore as you 'd find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris , a barren beauty , an intriguer , a passion in reverse . There 's no heat in it . That old fool of a negro bitch and her signs and cauls and trembling dogs . I 've no doubt that what she saw in the sky was a great ice-floe breaking over Christendom . Una 's a true Theron , all right . The first Earl betrayed a good many heads to the block to get his belt . Oh , he was a bloody old bastard . He saw his best friend hanging in an iron cage without even so much as the flick of an eyelash . As for us , you and me , we are not thoroughbreds . We have some disgusting canaille in us somewhere  --  some warmheartedancestors . There was one , I know , who disappeared completely after he refused to sleep with Elizabeth . Some said that they hardly realized he was disappearing , he did it so gradually , a part at a time  --  until there was nothing left of him but a wellcut doublet seen bowing around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Grandfather had his cold side  --  perhaps not cold , only calculating : he calculated how to get every wench he wanted for his lechery . He had a boundless lechery . He shot  --  and stuck , for that matter  --  a good many men over women . He said that if men chose to brawl over drabs , they ought to make sure that there were no better brawlers . If , he said , I could find a worthy receptacle deep enough for my love , I should marry her , except you , Katherine  --  incest has been too long out of the fashion for an old beau like me to revive it . Someday there 'll be a lucky young ruffler  --  but God help the fool who gets Una . Strange , Wagnal said , that Una , who cared so little about her father that she did not even think about going to Mississippi when he was found dead  --  that , indeed , she made a decision not to go , for there was a lawyer down there to handle what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied her name more tightly to a nasty scandal which was not that her father met a dark and violent end , but that he hadp207been killed because he was thought to be a niggerlover , a stigma which she judged highly unfashionable  --  strange that she , whose motives were as cold and clear as the light from a polar star , should have made the mistake which ruined the ladder of her ambition , breaking all the rungs at once and landing her in a worse position than had been hers when she was a girl living on a miasmal and obscure Mississippi plantation with nothing but mirrors and the provincial fire-eaters to curry her prodigious vanity . But perhaps I am wrong . Perhaps Una had a passion for beauty ; and it was this alien warmth in the vastness of her arctic soul that undid her . Perhaps those dresses from Worth , the bandeaux of turquoises and pearls for her hair , the forty pairs of shoes , the feel and shimmer and sound of the silk , the lovely coralshadow look of her own breasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw her into a very passion of love for beauty itself and not a mere thing to further the ends of ambition . Mind you , I do not say that , even for an instant , she forgot or altered her ends , as most of us do as we dawdle along on the fool 's errand we have had thrust upon us . Oh no , Una was no pamphlet distributor , who tosses his papers under a culvert , knowing he will get his twenty-five cents anyway . She had her own papers to deliver : She was waiting to inform Woman that Mrs. Clinton Belton  --  better , Una Theron  --  was the queen of them all who would stand for no damned trifling from any of their feline breed . She knew their smell . And she was the Queen of them all when it happened . Why , God Almighty , Wagnal said , how in the name of all that 's holy , could any of them have expected to hold out against her . Perhaps Kate Chase Sprague , who was urbane and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped . But the Washington ladies must have known immediately they saw her that here was God 's punishment for all their sins  --  for all the adulteries they had projected upon their pillows before idly falling asleep at nights . They knew then that all the partners of all these adulteries  --  at least those who had real bodies  --  were lost . But they could see also , that , though Una 's eyes might seem to give hope to man , there was nothing behind them but the movement of a great glacial ambition ready to pass over everythingbefore it . That men could seldom sec  --  even the most cynical Latin ministers and attaches . It was the carpetbag lawyer who settled the Theron estate in Mississippi  --  Burrus , I think his name was  --  a jackleg shyster , who knew little enough about Coke and Blackstone , but had enough sharp prac- tice to cheat the eyeteeth out of the unwary . He came along to Washingtonwith fifteen thousand dollars , perhaps , the amount he said he had salvaged from the Theron estate  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed money to shine . Kate Chase Sprague , the brilliant girl who had them all round her little finger until Una came  --  the girl who used to sit parasol in hand before the tents of the Army of the Potomac and leave escorted by a different set of fatuous staffofficers every time she visited , with never anything less than a Major-General driving her back to Washington  --  was still to be conquered . Lincoln himself had listened to Kate 's advice  --  he kissed her a shade too enthusiastically at her wedding . Pale pink silk , diamond tiaras , the accounts of Mrs. Sprague 's brilliance in the New York papers , her damask covered pavilion  --  these were all a great weight for Una to lift and cast aside , but she was equal to it . With the help of Burrus , she pulled it off . Katherine used to say that she could see Una 's every move with the man . He is a little man , Katherine said , the seat of his trousers is too near the ground and he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine gimlet eye . Did n't he get out of Mississippi before the Kluckers killed him  --  and did n't he turn a pretty penny down there outa them niggers . I think that Una must have let him into the house in Lafayette Square herself . She heard the howd'ye do , ma'am , and saw the black string tie and the illcut silkfaced lapels and the not too clean cuffs and the funny way he held himself because of his back . She saw the little gimlet eyes estimating the prices of the Parisian furniture and bric-a-brac , the price of the gown and jewels she was wearing  --  greedily but with sly uneasiness . How do you do , Mr. Burrus ? How kind of you to come so soon  --  how very kind of you to make such a splendid settlement of the estate . Nothin ' at all , ma'am . list routine . The fee was five hundred dollars . Katherine said it must have been a thousand to begin with , but it could n't have stayed at that figure long with Burrus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breasts , for Katherine knew he came in the evening . She knew that Una would have received him in something decollette . Oh , maybe it came down to four or even three hundred  --  Una had all the manoeuvres of the dishonest whore down pat . She let him look all right  --  she let the little smoky gimleteyes rest on her finewovehide , but she said presently : Oh dear , Mr. Burrus , the General hasp209so many social obligations , now that he is at the side of dear General Grant , his wartime friend , I am afraid I shall have to cut short our pleasant interview . Oh yes , Burrus said . Official life . Well , I was in the war myself . Indeed ? What regiment ? Indiany , Burrus said . ( It was discovered later that he had been a sutler . ) We was at Shiloh and all down through there . Many 's the time I seen Gen'l Grant and yore husban ' tawkin ' over the campaign over a seegar and a cuppa cawfee . Ah yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , them were the days of companionship around the ole camp far . Many 's the time I wisht I was back in the ole Army a Tennessee . They was vycissytoods and tribulations , but the comradeship with big-hearted pat-ree-ottic men made up for that . Ah yes , Una said . Well , Mr.  --  ah  --  ah  --  Burrus  --  I ca n't thank you enough for your splendid and competent settlement of the estate . Now , ma'am , Burrus said , screening the gimleteyes with the curious , slightly swollen big-surfaced eyelids which reminded Una of the downcasteyes of a saint or a madonna painted on canvas . She could see the sideways downlook of the dark pupils , not boring now , but seeking the place to drive their bits in . Now , ma'am , Burrus said , softening down his hardcrass yankeevoice , that 's just the way I feel about you and the General . He began almost to whisper his words  --  a sort of softwhine it was . Maybe he was remembering how six of them came up to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to our ears that you plan to remain in Warner county . Tonight we have come to warn you that for your own good you had better be gone by tomorrow . If you are not , we shall return to give you a taste of the hickory . The room was silent . They were standing around him as he sat on the bed 's edge , one boot on , the other off . The man was in a long red flannel robe with the belt of a Confederate web holster gathering it in at his middle . The faceless face was made of red calico with the eye and mouth holes bound in white and a red cloth tongue lolling out . Burrus could see the muddy boots and the gray homespun trousers where the red flannel stopped . And they were just like any boots and trousers that a man might see in thousands of streets wearing out warp and woof and shoeleather in the way it had been worn out since the first sheep had been sheared and the first cow skinned . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him and one had a tough elastic hickory stick  --  Burrus could hear it quirting through the air like ap2I0 bullet ricocheting  --  and one had a blacksnake whip caught looped and shiny and strong in his hand . They looked a little like him and Sis had looked in the lookin ' glass when Ma made them those witches suits and they put candles in the punkins to go and scare the neighbors back in Terry Hut . I ai n't a-going to go , Burrus said . I ai n't a-going . The man in the red robe took a whistle and , pushing the red cloth tongue aside blew a short , shrill , gurgling blast . I 'm a-going to stay , Burrus said . And I 'm a-going to find out who done that to Mr. Theron and his nigger . Two of the black ones had him by the arms then ; and then they were marching him down the hotel steps through the empty lobby into the dusty street . He hollered once , but he could n't after that , for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it tasted green and salty on his tongue . They put him on a horse , facing toward the rump , and tied a rag around his eyes . He began to tingle at the base of his spine , and he thought maybe he was going to dirty his pants , but he did n't . He heard the shrill gurgling whistle several times and the leather creak- , ing as they got down off the horses . There was n't a word said until his coat and shirt was off and he felt a tickly wind on his back and chest as he stood on tiptoe reaching his wristcords . Then he felt the big , firm hand on his back  --  an almost caressing touch  --  measuring the stroke to come . He heard the quirt of the blacksnake through the old , miasmal air of Mississippi , and he thought : Why , God , this is awful to do a man thisaway  --  to take him out and strip him down and beat him with a whip like he ai n't got a right even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God himself and hurt him hard and beat all his dignity outen him . It ai n't right  --  an ' I got my rights . I 'm a human , ai n't I ? The blacksnake cut and cracked around his back , winding its snaketailover the tendermeat under his arms and on his breast and across his hardenedup man 's nipples . Then he got the sharp canine , tigertalonedslash of the little end and the sharp goosefleshed pain running back from it  --  and felt the wind squish out of his belly from the force of the blow . He heard it and felt it for eight strokes . Then there was water on his face , and he began to feel the raw sting of his back and breast , as if he were a giant with a huge tender hide . Now Mr. Burrus , the one in red 's voice said , now that we have brushed you a little to remind you that we can not brook disobedience , we will remind you again that you will either leave Warner county byp211tomorrow night or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollered , Burrus thought . I hope to Christ I ai n't . Oh , God , let me see the day I can git ' em . He paid his bill to the hotelkeeper at noon and got on his horse , riding towards Vicksburg , his shirt sticking to the drying raw meat and blood on his back . Yes , ma'am , that 's jist the way I feel about you and the General . Now that the General 's Mr. Secertarry of War , ma'am , he 's gon na need a good bit of help  --  a good few public servants to do his bidding . He raised his eyegimlets to Una 's face and sought to drive them into the quartz surface of her blue eyes , but he dropped them again . Yes , Una said and waited . Well , Burrus said , now that the General 's  --  Yes ? Una said . What is it you wish , Burrus ? Burrus looked up angrily . Well , Mr. Burrus ? Well , Burrus said , there are places with tradin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is needed for traders  --  not ongrateful men that 'll be liable to bite the hand that 's feeding ' em . Oh , Una said . At which post Mr. Burrus do you think you could serve your country and the Generalbest ? Well , ma'am , Burrus said , still looking down , for there was no need now to look at Una 's hard naked eye , Fort Sofa 's in the Territoryand needs a good manager . Ah , Una said . I 've heard that a good trader earns twenty-five thousand a year . Well , ma'am , I do n't  --  Mr. Burrus the moment I saw you I knew you to be a man of benevolence and charity , Una said . Now , I have a private charity for which I could use , say , ten thousand dollars a year . Ten thousand ! Burrus said . I have heard , Una said , that a good many post-traders are generous men . I heard recently of one who had charities of twelve thousand dollars a year to his credit . Living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been corrupted by our horrible firewater , touched his sensibilities to the extent that he gives the money to one of the ladies here in Washington to be used for unfortunate people . Well , ma'am , Burrus said , there 's a good bit in what you say  --  a good bit . Shall you be here in Washington , say , in two or three days ? Una said . Then come again at the same time , say Thursday . It is a matter of record , Wagnal said  --  and even the little two-by-four paper in Knoxville  --  people began to stare at Katherine and me . More than once we heard Mrs. Belton 's sister and other hushed scraps of sentences . The gossips began to whisper that I 'd married a Rebel and ap212fallen woman . Her Pa was killed by the Kluckers because he slep with a nigger . Well , I ai n't for human slavery , but I always been dee-cent an ' I do n't want to have any truck with any ole niggerlover . I always say there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  an ' it up to them to keep their place . One day , God forgive me , Wagnal said , I hit a man . He was coming out of the saloon or the hotel bar  --  and I heard him behind the swinging doors shooting off his mouth . That holy old son of a bitch , Wagnalhimand his niggerlovin ' wife . He was n't a very big man  --  Worsham Jones was his name  --  the hostler who had once worked in your grandfather'slivery stable . He did n't have any front teeth  --  people said he had pulled ' em out to keep from going to war as the toothless boy did at Shiloh . He was a little , stringy , scraggy , blear-eyed fellow who always smelt of horsedung and urine and his own foul sweat . He came out of the swinging doors with Katherine 's name on his lips , and I forgot myself  --  I forgot how big I was and hit him in the face . His head snapped back and I thought I heard his spine crack as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell backwards , and his nose began to bleed down into the wide gap left by his cartridge biters  --  and the blood ran down his shabby , stubbly yellow gray quarter inch long whiskers . People backed away from me in fear . I must have looked crazy mad . But I got over it soon . I picked up Worsham Jones and helped him down the street to the sheriff 's office  --  Don Trott 's father was sheriff . Mr. Trott , I said , I wish to plead guilty to striking this man . I have comported myself in a most un-Christian manner . I happened to hear him passing a remark about my wife  --  in a public place  --  and I could not control my temper . Well , sir , Mr. Trott said , well , sir , Reverend Wagnal , I can see how you felt . And it 's not my business to do anything unless the other party wants to complain . Worsham , you goin ' to swear out a complaint ? He did n't hear me right , Worsham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said I said . He had a gang with pick hannels  --  Worsham , the sheriff said , Captain Hanks missed a good bit a money from the till of his livery barn not so many years ago  --  and Mrs. Hanks could never account for them two mares that you said died . I lived here twenty-five years now , man an ' boy , Worsham said , an ' I ai n't never had nothin ' but bad luck . By Gand , they 're allus a-pickin ' at me a-tryin ' to make out I ai n't an honest man . Him and his gang jumped onta me , but I ai n't sayin ' nothing , fer the reason I could n't make it stand up in ap213court a law . I would n't never go to a-lawin " cause I 'm a pore man and would n't stand a chance . Worsh , the sheriff said , why do n't you git ? Git ? Worsham said . Yeh , the sheriff said , looks like the town 's gittin ' too damn ' little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said : There ai n't any complaintagin ' you under the law here , Reverend Wagnal . Are they any complaint agin ' the other party here  --  slander mebbe ? There is no complaint , Sheriff , I said . Well , he said , you can git , Worsh . Now , Doc , Mr. Trott said , do n't you let any trash like that git you down . Missus Trott and me knows how you taken care a Don durin ' the war  --  and they ai n't a decent man er woman in this town 's gon na stand by an ' see you an ' Missus Wagnal abused . They can put that in their pipe and smoke it . But it was n't the same . Perhaps it was because Rome and his family had gone to Kansas , or because Shuball York went away too and John Simpson died and we did n't meet at Rome 's and walk home to our house and sing songs of an evening any more . Maybe that was it in part  --  but there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Una 's selling post-traderships and getting caught . Getting caught was the sin . Do n't ever mislead yourself on that score , young man . Why , before it happened every Goddamned woman who could get hold of a paper ( and who had n't been snubbed too obviously by Una in Burlington social life  --  though even those were prone to follow her fashions and boast of their former intimacy with her ) and read what Una did or what she wore in Washington Society was bound to copy her to the limit of her husband 's purse  --  or try to copy her in bumpkin 's fashion . Inwardly all of them cursed Una 's reputation and envied her  --  and when she was caught each breathed her secret deepdrawn sigh of relief that God had removed such a formidable foe from the feminine lists . Now they had only that frumpy Mrs. Trott to show up in the matter of bonnets , or that forward and perky and too beautiful Wagnal woman who was now shamed by her sister 's thievery , or that'silly Mrs. Abel who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or that Mrs. Dunn who wore such extreme clothes , that if the truth was known they 'd bet there was a touch of the tarbrush somewhere and what was more they would n't be a teeny-weeny bit surprised if she did n't turn out to be from a bad house maybe down in New Orleans . Could Katherine have been otherwise but bored and annoyed in such a village and such a situation ? And though she loved our old deep-porched , deep-lawned house and the little iron negroes holding out their iron rings for the horses , she did not want to stay . Thomas , she said , we must leave . I can not stand this place any longer  --  I can not abide it . It is a bore , an evil humdrum bore . I shall die if I live here any longer . We could go to New York state , I said . There are two churches there . No , she said , there is one in Fork City , Kansas . I think it 's a little wood church , square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeb Stuart helped to collect the money to build it when he was just out of West Point . I saw him in Richmond once on a sleek black stallion when I was just fourteen . He had a black plume on his hat and a great fan beard . He was only a colonel then , but he was the talk of the town . Let us go to Kansas , Thomas . That is how I came here , Wagnal said . And Stuart , Goddamn his foppish soul to hell , Goddamn his sanctity and his success and his plumes and his horses and his banjoman , Sweeney , and his Prussian dragoon , von Borcke and all his fire-eating heroics  --  even his deathwoundat Yellow Tavern  --  Goddamn them all to hell , Wagnal said quietly , his old voice whistling on the sibilants . He was dead and rottingaway , but I 'll venture to say that a million women still prayed for him  --  still prayed his ghost into their beds before they fell asleep to dream of those plumes , that beard , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all jackboots and horsepistols and sabres and beards and firegilt buttons going along the turnpike to the tune of Lorena on a minstrelshow banjo . And Stuart with his Goddamned knee crossed over the saddle , singing . Why for fifteen years I had the holy , erotic body of Major-General James Ewell Brown Stuart in bed with me and my wife  --  between us like a rusty Confederate sabre . But I did n't know it then . I did not know that the bones of the Brian de Bois-Guilbert , the Galahad of the Confederacy , the Light Cavalryman of the Nation , had sepulchred themselves in my bed . Or perhaps I had known it a long time . Maybe the very instant that Katherine articulated the words which had been screamed shouted and cooed and prayed out all over the Confederacy  --  which had been breathed moistly through young sweetmoist lips to the fine linen pillowcases of a thousand silly ovalfaced primplipped girls  --  maybe that first time she said them softly in Knoxville , Iowa , I knew . But in those days we were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made four . I think that one Sunday after Katherine was dead , I was in thep215church up there and the service was going on or just over and I fell into a reverie , thinking of the new bronze plaque the parish had put up to the memory of Stuart , the preux chevalier sans peur et sans reproche . It struck me that this Galahad had cuckolded me and continued to cuckold me for years . And he had slipped away again as he did when he rode around McClellan . And good God Almighty , what could I do , loving Katherine as I did  --  and both of them dead and maybe right then in each other 's arms in heaven . PAPA was at the store in Elgin when they stopped in the yard by the pecan tree to water their horses . Myra looked out of the window , because she always looked out of the window when anyone came by the house . Most days there was little enough to see . And she got so tired of the dust and the snow and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saddlebags with quinine and elderberry bark salve and foxglove and cherry pies and riding off on Old Caesar to help the neighbors and Papa staying at the store all hours and acting as judge and Sister Hettie so cross and Brother Ream off in the fields all day and Sister Ellen so funny and quiet , she was just lonely and that was all there was to it . After Knoxville , Ioway , Elgin , Kansas , was n't much , she could tell you . Indians and settlers and a mover or two . Sometimes she thought Ma might just as well stay home and let the whole push starve or die of malaria or cholera or just plain laziness . Why , some of them did n't have anything to eat half the time , and they had every bit as good places as Papa had . They still had one room cabins and shacks and some of them still lived in those old soddies full of bedbugs and fleas and ants  --  and the women too shiftless to keep a good house . Why , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Papa brought them here last year , she just sat in the wagon and looked at the one-room shack he had built and burst into tears . And he said : There , now , Myra , honey . There now . We 'll have to have a little time , honey . Well , it had n't been long until they had a nice big house  --  not so big as the one in Knoxville but better than any around there  --  and a barn and a corn crib . Papa had some pride !  |p216Still  it was n't near so nice as living in a town . But Papa would sign that old General Belton 's note  --  and for ten thousand dollars ! And lose his livery-stable and have to move away from Knoxville . And they stole him blind while he was away during the war  --  especially that old Worsham Jones , a poor white trash fellah that come from Kentucky and pulled out his front teeth so he could n't chew cartridges and would n't have to go to war . Papa went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too and owned niggers once . But he was only elected a lieutenant and him an officer in the Mexican war too . But anyway there was a lot of the men and just young boys back in Knoxville that just said they would n't volunteer at all if Papa was n't made colonel of the regiment . But it was just like Papa when he took the Knoxville boys to one side on the drill ground at Keokuk and said : Gentlemen , we will go to this war and we will not bother about who is colonel and who is not . You will remember that Mr. Hanks will be with you and will do what he can for you no matter what kind of straps he wears on his shoulders . And even that big lunk of a fellow , Sleepy Bates , who did n't look like he had right good sense came around to the house and told Ma what a good man he thought Papa was . And young Rufus Lamb , that grocery boy , cried when he told Ma about Papa talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the battle of Atlanta and that he was shot in the knee at a place called Corinth  --  and through his side at Atlanta too , before they took him to that awful Andersonville prison . And besides Papa could n't hear good on one side because the cannon at Shiloh went off too close to his ear . Mamma read her Papa 's letters while they were scraping linen rags and every kind of white cloth for lint for the Sanitary Commission . And it seemed that there had always been so many dead or hurt that she knew : Sleepy Bates and Frederick Ware and Mr. Shuball York and that boy without the teeth and so many boys . And all the time Papa was in danger too  --  and he almost starved to death himownself in that old prison . My , how she hated those old Rebels . Once she wrote to Papa and told him so , not remembering that Papa 's brothers were Rebels until after she mailed the letter . When she got Papa 's answer from Vicksburg , Mississippi  --  written on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he did n't say anything about her saying that at all . And there was a greenback in the letter that Papa said was for some ribbons for a new bonnet . She thought she loved Papa better than anybody inp217the whole wide world and wrote to him apologizing about saying those things about the Rebels . Now she could see the men in the yard better . There were three of them . One of them got down off his horse and led two of the horses up to the wooden trough near the pecan tree . The other one whose feet were n't in the stirrups sat on his horse kind of funny . She had to go away from the window to see her biscuits in the oven . She had just finished looking at them and trying them with a broomstraw when the men knocked at the back door . That Wood Sipperly with his old dirty beard and that dirty old soldier coat was standing there with a pistol strapped on him holding his horse and Milt Gaby in a pair of homespun breeches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifle in a sheath sticking up beside him . In the middle between Sipperly 's and Gaby 's horses there was a young man  --  really not much more than a boy  --  sitting wearily in the saddle of a claybank mare that looked like Mr. Ed White 's horse . The boy looked at Myra sullenly . His eyes were swollen and there was a dried dribble of blood on one of his pink , downy cheeks and a dark drop or two on his bright yellow neckcloth . Gaby had the claybank 's bridle in his hand . Myra saw now that the boy 's legs were tied under the mare and that his hands were tied behind him . Mornin ' , Miss Hanks , Sipperly said with a silly grin . Air the Judge to home ? No , Myra said , not smiling . Mr. Hanks has n't come home to dinner yet . Sipperly shifted from one foot to the other and petted his beard under Myra 's cold , suspicious gaze . Is there anything I can do for you , Mr. Sipperly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like whiskey and stables and everybody knew about him and that squaw he had out at that old soddy he had on what he called his place . We was wonderin ' , Sipperly said , sniffing the biscuit smell . We been a-riding all night and ai n't et  --  we was wonderin ' Myra fixed them some bacon and eggs and gave them some of her biscuits on the kitchen table . Shore is good , ma'am , Gaby said , chewing one egg and one biscuit . Myra silently buttered and honeyed a halfdozen biscuits , pouredsome coffee , sweetened it and put in some good thick cream . Then , taking a half dozen strips of bacon from the skillet , she went out towhere the claybank was tied to the hitching post under the pecan tree . She untied the reins and led the mare to the back stoop where a fly or two droned over the honey and bacon . Nervously , she brushed them aside  --  and tied the reins to the doorknob . Hungry ? Myra said , her face pink and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm , the boy said sullenly . Like biscuits and honey ? Myra said . Yes 'm , the boy said  --  and then choked out : Thank you , ma'am . Lean over , Myra said . The boy leant over , and Myra fed him her biscuits with honey and bacon and coffee . He ate loudly and greedily . Thank you , ma'am , he said again , after Myra had wiped his mouth and washed his face . He was better-looking without the blood on his cheek . That was n't their notion , he said nodding toward the kitchen and moving one of his Texas cowboy boots which Myra noticed had a little triangular hole in it that showed his bare toe . No ; it was n't . Is this your horse ? No . ' Tai n't theirs neither . They took it and put me on it to save their own hide . That there 's his story , Miss Hanks , Sipperly said . He was standing on the steps with several new yellow strings of egg yolk on his beard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's down to the store , ai n't he ? I do n't know . Mr. Hanks may be on his way home to dinner . Papa was just driving into the yard . There was somebody sitting on the seat of the spring wagon with him  --  a man with a silky beard in a broad old soldier hat . Papa and the man got down off the wagon , and Papa tied the horses . How d'ye do , Judge ? Sipperly said . How d'ye do , Mr. Sipperly , Papa said . We got a man here  --  Sipperly began . Myra , Papa said , looking toward the house . She went inside . She always tried to be obedient to Papa . But she watched them from the kitchen window : Papa talked with them a while and Sipperly and Gaby and the boy rode away and Papa and the man with the beard and the old soldier hat came in . Of course Papa had a beard too , but you expected a man as old and dignified as Papa and you expected that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it  --  but somehow you did n't expect the young man with Papa to have one , especially as big and black a one as he had , though maybe hep219was n't really as young as he might be . He held himself straight and limped just a little with his left leg as he came into the kitchen with Papa . Myra , Papa said , this is Mr. Beckham . He came into town today , and he 's going to help at the store . Mr. Beckham , this is my daughter , Myra Hanks . How d'ye do , sir , Myra said primly , thinking how straight he held his shoulders and how nice and crisp his black hair looked . How d'ye do , ma'am , he said in a big hearty voice , though he was n't such a big man . I said to the Captain it was just bully of him to ask me to dinner . Papa , Myra said , you should n't bring company in our old kitchen . You take Mister  --  you take the company in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had Brother Ream kill a chicken and I 've got biscuits . She took Papa and the stranger in the parlor and sat them down  --  but before she sat them down she asked Papa in a whisper : Papa , what are them old dirty men going to do to that boy ? Now , Myra , honey , nothing , Papa said . I told them to put him in the store woodshed until we could get the marshal . I do n't like that old Sipperly , Papa . There wo n't be any rope ? No , honey . No . Myra went to the dining-room and began to set the table , putting on the best silver . She thought Papa said his name was Beck or something . He 'd been in the war because he 'd called Papa Captain that way  --  and most everybody called Papa Judge , here . Ma did n't get back for dinner , so Hettie sat at the foot of the table and Papa served , but Ellen would n't come out of her bedroom because she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an old soldier of the Army of the Potomac . He was shot in the battle of Gaines 's Mill in the Seven Days ' Battles around Richmond , and was taken prisoner and sent to Bell 's Island in 1862  --  two years before they took Papa to that awful old Andersonville . He 'd come west because a newspaper fellah said you could grow up with the country  --  and he thought it was a boss idea . Why , in 1862 , Myra said , we lived in Knoxville , loway ; and Papa was in the battle of Shiloh  --  and we were all scared to death . But Papa only had his knee hurt  --  but my , oh my ! how we missed him ! Mr. Beckham was looking at her , holding up his chin proudly andp220smoothing his beard that was so black and silky against one of Ma 's best white linen napkins . Mr. Beckham was all the way from Philadelphia . The next morning after Mr. Beckham was there when she had finished doing the breakfast dishes and dusted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sewn , but she just could n't sit still . She kept thinking of the boy tied on the horse and old Wood Sipperly and then Papa bringing Mr. Beckham home to dinner  --  and Mr. Beckham being in the Civil War too and being shot and taken prisoner like Papa . She went in Papa 's Room off the parlor and looked in his bookcase for a book ; but she had read Ivanhoe and Ormond  --  and there were a lot of old things in Latin like Livy 's Works and The Lives of the Caesars by Suetonius and then a book called The Origin of Species that had caused so much talk about apes being our ancestors and The Advancement of Learning by Sir Francis Bacon and Childe Harold by Lord Byron , which reminded her of Sleepy Bates whose name was Harold and Shakespeare 's Works and Napoleon and His Marshals by J. T. Headley and a lot of other things that were all too deep for her . Papa was a great reader and smart as a whip ; and he had taught school in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his books was interesting enough . So she told Mamma she 'd saddle up and go down to the store at Elgin and see if Papa had any new Butterick patterns from New York . Mamma helped her saddle up Old Caesar  --  and Sister Hettie said : Humph ! She 's goin ' to see her new beau . But Ellen smiled sympathetically . She rode out of the yard with Ring , the puppy yipping at Old Caesar 's heels . He was a black Shepherd puppy with a little white ring around his throat and just a darling . And Old Caesar did n't mind him  --  and it was such a fine morning  --  and wheat was coming up out of the black dirt in such crisp green shoots ! Mr. Beckham came out of the store and helped her down from Old Caesar and hitched him to the post and said : Good morning , Miss Hanks ! Ai n't it a tiptop morning ? She got down in the sunlight feeling so fine that she did n't evenlook at the painted Osage on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really notice the funny sad stare the Indian gave her . Good morning , Mr. Beckham , she said . Where 's Pa  --  Mr. Hanks ?  |p221Why  , let me see , he said . He took the wagon and went off about an hour ago . I do n't recollect where he said he was a-going . Oh , Myra said . I thought maybe he had some new patterns in the store . Well , Mr. Beckham said , you just come right in and look . I do n't know that I know where they are . Ai n't it a just bully morning ? She said she could n't find any new patterns ; and Mr. Beckham was a-telling her about Philadelphia , when she saw Papa and the marshal , Mr. Ernie Stewart , drive up in the spring wagon . Papa and the marshal got down and stood there squinting in the sun . Mr. Stewart had a rifle ; and they looked pretty serious , so she walked out and spoke to them . Mr. Stewart took off his hat and said Myra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Mr. Stewart looked up toward the wagon awkwardly . But Myra saw the end of the rope and the Texas cowboy boots sticking out from under the blanket and the little piece of barefoot through the triangular hole before Mr. Stewart could drive away . The poor boy had n't even had any socks . Papa ! Papa ! she said . That boy ! I do n't believe he did it . No siree , I do n't . Now , Myra , Papa said . Now , honey . You let them , Papa ! You let them ! She began crying . Myra ! Papa said . Oh , oh , I 'm sorry , Papa  --  I know you did n't . But he was such a boy  --  and old Wood Sipperly ! I know , honey . They told the marshal he got out of the woodshed . Mr. Stewart and I found him . He 's going to question Sipperly now  --  Questions ! Myra , child , please forgive me . I should have known . Oh , Papa , excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She got on Old Caesar and rode home , tears blinding her all the way . Rome unlatched the kitchen door and held up the candle against a dark , muttering March night , but Rome discerned the matted blackbrownbeard and the eyes looking out from under the brim of the wide felt hat . Well , sir ? Rome said.  |p222Rome  ? the voice came muted and deep from under the beard . Brother Rome . Loosh ! Brother Lucius , Rome said softly . Come in . Loosh looked over his shoulder toward the road . I cai n't stay , Rome . I thought mebbe I could bait mah hawss and git a bite to eatWhy , sure , Loosh , Rome said . The candle sent the shadows shiveringupward on their faces . Rome put his boots on and his trousers over his nightshirt and lit a lantern . As they walked to the barn with Loosh 's horse , a wind blew over the grass , thunder muttered again and then bloomed over the hill like shaken tin . There 's going to be some weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night . I cai n't , Loosh said . I got to ride a fur piece befoh mawnin ' . It thundered again hard . Puts me in the mind of Shiloh , Loosh said . Shiloh ? Rome said . Were you at Shiloh , Loosh ? I was , Rome , Loosh said tenderly . Sho was . I recollect seein ' a feller with a six shooter farm ' at our flagtoter  --  farin ' cool an ' slow , with his sword put up and drawin ' a bead down eveh time he squoze the triggeh . An ' look like eveh time he fared he got himself anotheh flagtoter . I was settin ' in the crotch of a tree , an ' , thinks I , that shootin 's too damn ' peart . So I draws down a bead on the feller right between the eyes . Mah fingeh just started to mash down on the triggeh  --  she 's a fine hair triggeh too  --  when somethin ' henders me . I takes me anotheh good look at that feller , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course they was all them whiskehs and the smoke , but I set thar and watched that feller till he put up his six shooter and began farm ' a musket and then I knowed it was Rome . An ' I had me a bead ! I did n't far anotheh shot all day . That was you , was n't it , Brotheh Rome ? That just about fits it , Rome said . I knowed it was . By Gand , when I seen that shootin ' , you could n't fool me . Reminded me a the day you killed them Shawnees that got Pa . I had a bead on you with that rifle Pa give you just before the Shawnees got him  --  yore own gun . I threw it in Owl Crick that night and lit out  --  an ' neveh went near the damn ' wah since . I ai n't any too Ganddamn ' finicky , seein ' it 's a hard row to hoe gittin ' along in the world , but I reckoned Gen'l Albert Sidney Johnston would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied to shed mah own brotheh 's blood . Ip223do n't believe they eveh missed me  --  anyway Gen'l Johnston was killed . I reckon they just wrote me off as kilt at Shiloh . Rome put his hand on Loosh 's shoulder and held it there for a moment . Come in , Loosh , and have some supper , Rome said . I cai n't stay long , Rome . I 'm on my way to mebbe Mexico . I was up in Abilene a month ago and they was askin ' me about a bill of sale fo me and my pardner 's hawsses . I just did n't like the idy a them askin ' me with a six shooter  --  me havin ' been in the battle of Shiloh and seein ' so many dead men they was common as dirtAre they after you , Loosh ? Rome said . I do n't know , Rome . I neveh inquiahed . But I got seperated from mah pardner . He said he knowed a fellah out in this neck a the woods called Wood Sipperly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy with light hair and down on his face  --  always dawgged out in Texas boots and a yeller neck cloth . He said Sipperly 'd hide us out , an ' I was to look fur him at Sipperly 's place . Loosh , Rome said , you wo n't find that boy there . You 'd better go on without him . Well , Rome , Loosh said , I reckon I 'd be obliged to hunt him up  --  him bein ' mah pardner an ' Loosh , Rome said , his voice on a deadcalm level , my advice is to go on . Oh , Loosh said . You know this yeah Sipperly ? Yes , Loosh . Oh , Loosh said . He was remembering what Ma had said to him and Granny and Little Ream : You boys always heed your Brother Romulus ; he 's wise . That was a good many years ago . Little Ream was eveh a one to follow you around , Brother Rome . Whateveh come a that boy ? I buried him at Shiloh , Rome said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright as a cricket and allus a great hand to coat his Brother Rome and read a passel of books . What side was he on , Rome ? He was a lieutenant in a Union regiment from Kentucky , Rome said . He knew you was a Yank , Rome , Loosh said . But take Granny , he said , after leaving a little time silent for the low thunder . Granny was a far-eatin ' states ' rights man . Him and Little Ream quarreled right bitter . Somebody in Abilene  --  I do n't recollect who ' twuz  --  he knowed a Granville Hanks that got killed in Ohio with Morgan . An ' anotheh man said Granville Hanks was with Morgan all right and holped the Old Man break out of that Indiana pen and then went oveh to Virginnieand joined up with Mosby  --  but afteh he let his hair grow out whur they cut it off in the pen . That sounds more like Granny  --  always nervous and skittish and sassy . Yes , Rome said , and Granny could ride . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison . Gold must have helped . Sheetlightning outlined the low hills to the east and the sullen thunderpeals seemed to roll over and under the ground . When they got to the kitchendoor , Rome said : You know , Brother Lucius , that it is not like me to deny shelter to my own , but I think it would be better if you waited in the barn . I 'll fetch you some things for your saddlebags . Here 's the lantern . Saddle up again and be ready . I had wished for you to know my family , butDo n't you worry yore head , Rome . I kin see what your gittin ' at . Now , Loosh , let 's not put it that way . Put it any way . The both of us knows thar 's a-plenty a rope an ' a damn ' sight too many stout limbs in this country . He took the lantern from Rome and walked back toward the barn . He hardly needed the lantern now , for the lightning was flashing fast . When Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting in flannel wrappers . What 's the trouble , Mr. Hanks ? Lorna Browne said . No trouble , Lorna , I 'm just helping a traveller . Myra , Lorna said , turning her sharp hawkface to her daughter , go in and turn down the bed in the spare room . No , Rome said , he ca n't stay . His business is urgent . What have we to eat that 'll do for his saddlebags ? I 'll get it , Lorna said . But , Papa , there 's going to be a storm . Why wo n't he come in ? Myra , honey , where 's my oilskin coat ? She knew it was no use to ask Papa anything more , so she went to find the oilskin . Rome went to his desk in the room off the parlor and took a hundred dollars in greenbacks from a pigeonhole . When the two women saw him out the door , it had begun to rain a few big scattered drops . He carried cold chicken , bread , cold biscuits , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a side of bacon underp225the oilskin . He paused once in the lightning to put the greenbacks in the package of biscuits . Loosh was sitting on a box in the lantern light , shoving a cartridge into a singleaction Colt 's . Well , Rome , I was right glad to see you . This oilskin will keep out a little of the weather  --  and be careful when you open the grub not to lose any of it . I was right glad to see you , Brother Loosh . It reminds me of the old days in Kentucky . Oh , Loosh , where did you boys bury Ma ? Right beside Pa . Little Ream had stones cut with their dates . Loosh swung over into the saddle . Rome stood holding the lantern . Goodbye , Rome . Goodbye , Brother Lucius . Just as the lightning showed Brother Lucius ' bearded outline black beside the pecan tree the rain began to come down hard . Rome heard Ring howl a little in the house . He was wet to the skin when he set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cup of hot coffee and he lay awake all the rest of the night , thinking of the rain at Shiloh and Wagnal and Clint Belton and General Grant and Little Ream and the Shawnees and California and the Mexican war and Kentucky when he was a boy . THERE were about eighty of us after Pickett 's Charge , Uncle Pink said . Oh , a few more came in afterward when we got back into Virginia , but I do n't reckon we was more'n a hunderd and fifty when all was totaled up  --  and we had eight hunderd when we marched into Pennsylvania . Ole Wagg and Dance Sudderth and James Poe and Sergeant Wheary and Lige Boggs and Brothuh all kilt . Lacey said Wagg was dead shore enough  --  died hollerin ' scriptur . Evil comin ' outen the Nawth , Lacey said . Tuck it in the belly and the haid at the same time  --  went down like a stuck hawg . Lacey just had time to pick up the Bull Pistol . He sat around mopin ' about Wagg fur a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good . Gahd , Uncle Pink said , I remember we shore felt turrible the nextp226night . We was plumb wore out marchin ' along the roads in the rain  --  slipped back'ards and forrards and sideways eveh step we took . Cole and hot at the same time we was : Afteh all that heat and then the storm , we did n't care much where we was goin ' . I kept slippin ' along in the mud with Jud beside me and Lacey in front . Seems like I 'd go to sleep walkin ' along with the rain in my face . I 'd wake myself up cryin ' like a baby . Mebbe I was cryin ' for Sion who was lyin ' back there in the rain by the fence  --  and his head Gand knows where in that big field we charged across . Mebbe I was cryin ' for Old Wagg or Dance Sudderth or Lige Boggs . But I think I was cryin ' because of what they did to us . They got no right ! They got no right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured that , I cai n't tell , Uncle Pink said . They had as much right to shoot at us as we did them . But they beat us back and ground us down and sent us home . I use ' to say it was n't a fair fight . But there ai n't any fair fightin ' in the world . It 's just that way . There was a boy next to me in the column that night said : If we 'd had Ole Jack , it 'd been a differ'nt story . What rigiment ? Lacey says . Nineteen Vuhginia , the boy says . Vuhginny ? Lacey says . Well , you git on back to ' em . This yere 's a Nawth Cahlina rigiment  --  and we do n't want none of you hyear . Leave him alone , Lacey , Jud said . I will , if he keeps his trap shet about Ole Jack . If we 'd a had Zeb Vance today we'da licked ' em alone . Everybody kept hollerin ' about how the Virginia division was cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Next day  --  mebbe it was the next , I do n't remember , he got a-holt of me . Pink , he said , you write a good hand , do n't you ? Well , I did write a fair hand . My fingers is bad , he said . I want you to set down and write me a letter to Guv'ner Vance . Well , we clumb up in a wagon ; and he found a piece of wrappin ' paper and a pencil  --  and we wrote the letter . My dear Governor : I will trespass upon your indulgence to communicatethe sad fate that has befallen the old Eighty-sixth . We went on about the heaviest conflict of the war having taken place in the vicinity of Gettysburg , , Pennsylvania . We told Vance that Colonel Burleson was killed ; we listed all the dead and wounded we could remember down to Orren Brabble and Lige Boggs and Dance Sudderthand your Great Uncle Sion . We have only about eighty left for duty , we said . We told about Wagg 's gallantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made me put in Jud and Lacey and me . We even told how Reese fought with us and how he he'ped turn the gun . Thar , Albright said , that 's in the records now . Ai n't nobody gon na say the ole Eighty-sixth was n't in the worst of it . Well , Uncle Pink said , it never made any difference . It was always Pickett 's Charge  --  named for the Virginia division . People who do n't know what it was always say Pickett 's Charge . Oh , Zeb Vance got the letter all right  --  it got printed in the Official Records  --  and he holleredfor years about how Nawth Cahlina did n't git the proper credit . Even when Longstreet wrote those pieces for the Century Magazine , he had to stick in a sentence about how well the men from the Old Nawth State did their duty because he was a Republican and a scallawagand had to justify himself someway . But I do n't care any more , Uncle Pink said . As I see it now , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stone wall . I even wish sometimes I 'd died with the yaws like Brothah Paul . After that fight at Gettysburg yore grandfather got white and thin for a long time . I do n't know whether it was what he found out about war , or whether it was because Reese Eliot found his rigiment and left us  --  and Jud could n't be a hawss soldier like he wanted to be . Anyway , it got so Jud did n't talk to me so much any more . I was right fond of Jud . He was never a big boy , nor very strong  --  and judging from the way I felt myself , he must 've been scared to death until we got to that wall and oveh it . I do n't know how anybody who got oveh it could have been scared any more that day . It was n't bravery . No , suh ! You just did n't give a tinker 's dam what happened , if you got that fur . But it must 've cost Jud a peart effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't men like Wagg , or Lacey , or Reese . They were just nacherly born insensible to feah . But not us . I know all right . When we were boys Jud and me use ' to walk along a place on the Chimney Rock Road at night  --  a place whur they said hit was haunted . I remember , even it was bright moonlight , we use ' to take a-holt of each other 's hand . Yes , Uncle Pink 's earegg lifted up and down , how we got through Pickett 's Charge without runnin ' away , I 'm not sure . Mebbe I 'd 've run , if Sion had n't got shot . Mebbe Jud would 've run if Reese had n't been with us . When we got back home after Appomattox , Jud kept at Father to send us to the University of Vuhginia . Father , send Pink and me top228the University of Vuhginia . Well , Father had no objection to education , but he remembered how much his brother 's Vuhginia education had cost him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and he even got Mother to he'p him devil Father . But it did n't do any good . Best Jud could do was Chapel Hill . I did n't care . Spring before we went Jud got a new suit  --  purty one that a man in Caldwell made . And Mother altered it till it fit him fine . It was Confederate gray  --  almost Confederate gray . Nobody had many clothes or very good ones in those days . It just happened to fit Jud as good as it did after Mother got through  --  and he looked good in that beard he 'd grown in the army . Mary Ivy Dula had married Willie Fitchett , so Jud began to give himself airs and go sparkin ' around . Somebody said he was a reg'lar beau  --  the best dressed man in Gadkin county . I 've traveled some , Uncle Pink said , both out and in of books . Took me a good long time to see that being the Best Dressed Man in Gadkin County was a little like runnin ' a race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . Mebbe he never did , but he did have flashes of revelation , I think . The fact remains , however , Uncle Pink said , the bluevcined humpty dumpty behind his ear waggling again on his perpetual brink , that Jud was the Best Dressed Man in Gadkin County . He knew it too . Nobody eveh introduced him as Judson Harrington , the Best Dressed Man in Gadkin County . But mebbe Mary Ivy Dula Fitchett , standing beside her frontgate one day when Jud was ridin ' by , said : Jud Harrington ! You just git down off that hawss and come oveh heah and talk to me . Ai n't you even gona wish me happiness ? Why you 've handly spoken to me since you came back from the wah . Mebbe she even said , since you 've been the Best Dressed Man in Gadkin County . A flighty gal , Mary Ivy Dula , Uncle Pink said , a damp lecherous look appearing in his watery blue eyes ,  --  but a fine form . Kinda purty in the face too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sly milky look and fluttering eyelids . She had n't been married to Willie Fitchett a month , I reckon , before she was hollerin ' out at Jud across the front gate . Jud had n't been in Jeb Stuart 's cavalreh , but the Eighty-sixth had begun to git talked about . It was Zeb Vance 's ole rigitnent  --  and that letter Cap'n Albright and me sent from Gettysburg got printed in the Charlotte Observer . It had Jud 's name in it . And then there wasp229that new reputation of Jud 's as the Best Dressed Man in Gadkin County . On top of that Mary Ivy had been used to gittin ' just about everything Mary Ivy wanted . Her father owned half of Caldwell and everybody called him General Dula , though he was never more than a Majah . He gave Mary Ivy and Willie the house whur she hung on the gate . Picketfence it had around it , painted green , and a stone block in front of the gate with a ring in it to tie up yore hawss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evehthing her little scatterbrain could think of  --  but in order to think of anything , it had to slap her in the eye . Jud 's new gray suit and him on a black mar ' of Father 's ridin ' along the street . She all purtied up standin ' by the gate . Judson Wade Harrington you 're not going to pass me by without even so much as a howdy ! and you in Poppa 's regiment , too . There was that face of hern above the gate in front of the vines on that front porch . No denying it was a purty face in a way : a slim purty face with a slim nose that quivered like a rabbit 's  --  and a purty white skin . Had a nice ripe mouth too that was always quiverin ' fur this or that . Seemed to me she looked as if she was always in heat  --  a breeder . No ; a man cai n't hold it against Mary Ivy that she was like she was . A woman could  --  but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , I would n't a call her a deep , hard breeder , but she was a breeder . Well , she hung onto the gate and said : Why , Judson Harrington , you know I 've just been achin ' to see you ! You , one of the heroes of the battle of Gettysburg . You just ought a hear the purty things people keep sayin ' about you . I reckon Jud got down off the mar ' and walked up to the gate . How ah you , Judson Wade ? I 'll bet that 's what she said . Fine , thank you , Mary Ivy , Jud answered . You just come in and see my new house , Judson Wade . Willie ai n't heah . He and Fathah 's gone to Pine Spruce on business  --  but you ca n't get out of it . Jud was a fine rooster when he was away from the hens , but you can bet he blushed and stuttered . Oh , he went in . He had to . If Mary Ivy started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like you were about to fall asleep on a feathuhbed : you could n't fight agin it . Jud must 've settled back with a sigh . Now , I 'm not sayin ' that Mary Ivy lay down with him that first time . But it was n't long after that she did . I could tell by Jud 's actions . He got to swaggerin ' around and sparkin ' around all oveh the county . He got a passel of poontang around Gadkin county , before he and I left for Chapel Hill . Got to lickerin ' right smart too  --  you could n't do anything else and be the Best Dressed Man in Gadkin County . As I see it now , Father must have suspected him of hell-raisin ' and lickerin ' : He caught me totin Jud in at night a couple of times  --  but he made out like he had n't seen anything . He did n't even say anything about the mulatto gal that lived in a cabin down in a holler near home . Jud used to git a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the mulatto gal fur a change of luck . Her ole pappy lived with her . He was a free nigrah before the wah , but he neveh had his stepdaughter to support him until after the wah . When the nigrahs were freed she run away from Captain Frisbie 's place  --  she was the captain 's daughter . But she was prime . I kept tryin ' her out right much mahse'f  --  and I do n't reckon I eveh had so much fun . Huh pappy use ' to set outside so that nobody 'd be disturbed . I neveh could figgah out about Mary Ivy , until long aftehwards . She must 've talked Willie and her daddy out of goin ' after Jud . Why , Willie Fitchett , do n't you be so childish . Jud 's just a boy and a very deah friend of mine . How could you suspect me , the woman you married , of such horrible things anyway . She might have gone so far as to tell Willie that it was an insult to Pure Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might explain how I run onto Willie Fitchett begging Jud 's pardon for misjudgin ' him one night in a Caldwell saloon . They were both lickered , but still it sounded sincere . I always held the opinion that one of Mary Ivy 's children , Isabel Ivy , was the spit of Jud , but I never heard anybody else mention it . Ole General Dula horsewhipped a man  --  a poorwhite named Jones  --  for sayin ' he beat him out of his property . The General did beat him out of it  --  that was the trouble . Dula met him on the square with a blacksnake whip and beat the hell out of him . Right smart of whippin ' in those days  --  and Dula was a Klan leader , so nobody was gon na pass any remarks about who his granddaughter looked like . You know , Lee , I do n't eveh understand how my fathah permitted Jud and me to go to Chapel Hill . Jud 's new suit had started to wear out a little before we went to the university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me one too . She made us some linen shirts out of boughten cloth  --  and Fathah allowed us to take hawses . And hawsesp231was valuable then . Jud took the black mar ' and Fathah got me a hawss off a man named Major Cawdor , who lived on the Hickory road . I reckon he was a majah in the Fifty-seventh Nawth Cahlina  --  and three or four of the Cawdor boys were in the rigiment . We always knew them  --  but Ole Man Cawdor was a clannish critter , a Seven Day Adventistand cracked as hell on the subject . His fathah had been a Scotch Presbyterian who liked his whiskey too well . Mebbe that accounted for Ole Cawdor takin ' up that quare flavor of religion . Anyway , he was a solemn old bird . People would say : Ole Man Cawdor never fit in the wah on Saturdays  --  or mebbe it was Mondays  --  because it was agin the Seven Day Adventist way of thinkin ' . The men in the Fifty-seventh said you had to be a Seven Day Adventist to git @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigimentand fit good too  --  but the Ole Man would never let ' em be officers , though one was elected a lieutenant and one a captain , and even the youngest could 've been a sergeant . But not him  --  he would n't let ' em  --  said it would look bad for their fathah . I guess they never liked the Ole Man very well  --  and they hated the Seven Day Adventist religion . The one that was kilt at Chickamaugawas fixin ' to die of a bad belly wound , when somebody says : I 'll go fotch yore Paw , Jed  --  name was Jedediah . No you wo n't , Jed says . You fotch the Ole Man an ' I 'll kill him too  --  hai n't no use increasin ' the casualties . I hai n't a-goin ' to spend my last minutes listenin ' to no Ganddamn ' preachin ' ! What you kin fotch me is a good snort of cawn . That was the way the story went . I cai n't vouch for how true it was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they never came back from the wah . Some said they went to Mexico . Old Cawdor and his wife and daughter and a bound boy ran his place . Might 've had more at one time , but people said they died off because he made them fast so much . More'n likely they died of the cholera , because I never thought he was as bad as he was painted . His house was sufferin ' for paint just as much as any house you can find around here these days  --  but , by Gand , Uncle Pink said , it was shore neat . It made you sick to think of all the work that must 've been wasted in that yard and inside the house . Dawgs was n't even allowed near the house ; stables was clean ; and the buggy was in the shed , for it was greased and shined within an inch of your life . And Gand he'p me , boy , if eveh I saw cawn fields and punkin ' patches like hisn  --  with neveh so much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by now that this yere Cawdor was yore great grandfather , Gand 's Chosen Cawdor  --  Daniel Cawdor . He use ' to breed a few hawses , so Jud and me rode out thar on the mar ' , me up behind , to git me a hawss to go to college on . Jud had a jug of cawn , and we lickered a little on the way out from Caldwell . This ole feller talks in the tongues , do n't he ? Jud said . No , Uncle Pink said , rubbing the tumef active egg , the secret encystation of years of defeat and corruption , Jud always spoke better English than I. Even I spoke better than I do now . You may have noticed how I catch myself now . Why , I was considered a good scholar in Gadkin county in my time . Maybe Jud said : Old Cawdor 's a fanatic , is n't he , Pink ? He 's what they call a Seventh Day Adventist , I said . Let 's slow down and have a drink , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got there with licker on our breaths , and late by a quarter of an hour . Young men , Old Gand 's Chosen said , you git no hawss from me  --  strong drink is a mockah . He had a fiery fanatical eye on us . I saw his old woman look out of the window and shake her head . He just stood there on the porch staring us down . We decided we 'd better git and started to mount the mar ' , when Anne Cawdor came out on the porch . Father , she said , these young men came to get the horse you promised them . The old man had never been known to break his word  --  considered it his duty to Gand . Besides , Father , there is cholera in Gadkin county ; and spirits are the only thing that keep it out of the system . Cholery ! Old Gand 's Chosen screamed . Cholery ! Jedediah , fotch me my swohd ! Now , Father , the girl said as gentle as eveh I heard a body speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Jedediah was killed at Chickamauga  --  and I had two brothers and three sisters die of the cholera . It gets him wild sometimes  --  the very word . She was only about sixteen . She had on a white shirtwaist and a dark homespun skirt . At her throat was that big cameo pin . I don'tp233doubt you 've see your grandmother wear it . She was a slim girl with the nicest hazelcolored eyes eveh I saw . I always dearly loved your grandmother . Cholery , Old Gand 's Chosen said . Gand has taken more of my children with cholery than with the swohd . Sit down , young men , I 'll fotch the hawss . There were a couple of splitbottomed chairs on the porch . We sat down ; and Anne brought us some coffee and biscuit and honeh . It 's not sourwood , she said . Lightning struck our tree . You must please excuse Father , Mother says . He was badly hit in the head at the battle of Chickamauga  --  and lay all night in the rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once he had the falling sickness . But I sha n't talk to you about the war . You were at Gettysburg , were n't you , Mr. Jud ? By Gand , Uncle Pink said , Jud was hers then . Mistah Jud . I could see him swell up like a hoptoad . We were both there ( he did n't call her anything ) , Pinckney and I  --  and our brother , Sion . I 'm sorry , Mr. Pinckney ; I had heard , but I had forgotten . If she had n't been so purty and gentle , she would 've sounded prim . She had been a schoolteacher  --  and I 'd heard she 'd even taught nigrahs . Jud was looking at her with a soft foolish look in his eye , when the Ole Man came up with the bay gelding . Heah , young man , he said harshly , heah 's yore hawss . That was twenty dollars , Father told me , Judson said . There is nothing due , your great grandfather said . He would take nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at us and shook her head . She was right : Old Man Cawdor was not a man to be argued with . Once on the streets of Caldwell , a year or so after that , I saw some nigrahs crowd a woman off the sidewalk  --  three drunk buck niggers . Old Cawdor saw it as he came out of Avery 's Feed Store . He walked oveh to ' em and looked at ' em with that wild fiery eye of his : Sons of Ham , he said , not loud at all , git out into the road . Now git down on yore knees and ask Gand to forgive you  --  and then beg Miss Jane 's pardon . The three nigrahs , Loyal Leaguers , they were , got down on their knees in the mud . They had on secondhandbroadcloth suits with brass buttons and goldbraid that they had bought somewhere from carpetbaggers at a fancy price , and they did n't hanker to git ' em dirty  --  and more than that , they had loaded pistols that the white Loyal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please fo'give us Gand ! Please excuse us , Missy ! Now stay thar till I tell you you kin git up ! Old Gand 's Chosen said . Miss Jane Wade , who was by the way kinfolks of ours , said : Thank you , Major Cawdor . Madam , Gand 's Chosen said , it is the duty of every servant of the All Highest to keep the lowest offspring of the black sinners in his appointed place . Miss Jane was about as skeered as the niggers when yore great grandfather looked at her . He went back into Avery 's to finish his trading . She was oncomfortableabout those niggers kneeling in the street , so she said : You can go now boys . No , ma'am , they said . We ain ' goin ' till Mahse Cawdah give de wohd . He go ' put de debbil on us , if we don ' do lak he say . Well , Miss Jane Wade went on home , and evehbody in town came down to see the three niggers kneelin ' in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think they were originally Old General Dula 's Sam and Ellum and Joe . Evehbody came down to see ' em . They were right in the square where the Confederate monument is now . Even the white Loyal Leaguer 's Leader came down and stood on the sidewalk  --  he had on a new pair of boots and would n't go out in the mud . Look yere , boys , he said . They ai n't anybody can make you do a thing like that thar . Yawl 's free . Git up offen yore knees . Yawl 's got the vote . We sons of Ham , Ellum said . Yes , suh , Joe said . We waitin ' fuh Mahse Cawdah  --  he gon na gi ' us de wohd . About an hour later Old Gand 's Chosen came out of Avery 's store . He looked at those three nigrahs a minute and said : Well , sinnahs , mebbe you can git off yore knees now , but eveh time you see Miss Jane , you git out in the road and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank Gand you ai n't struck dead . And they did it too . I saw Ellum do it years later when he was an old man  --  and Sam and Joe and Miss Jane were dead  --  to Miss Jane 's niece who looked like her . Then Gand 's Chosen turned and looked at the white Loyal Leaguer . It was Old Chicken Cruppy . Nobody believed he ever went to wah . But after the wah , under Guv'nor Holden , people use ' to say he stole a chicken and got elected to the state legislature  --  and that he had his eye on a turkey gobblah so that he could git elected to Congress . Chicken looked at Old Gand 's Chosen , but not in the eye  --  and started to git . But yore great grandfather was too fast fur him . He took Chicken by the shoulders and shook him till his teeth rattled.  |p235Your  great granddaddy was satisfied with that so he turned loose of Chicken and slapped him hard on the left cheek . Chicken just stood there . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were people who said that Chicken was n't right bright  --  anyway , he turned the right cheek . And yore great grandfather slapped him hard on that cheek . Mebbe that 'll teach you the principles of Christianity , although I doubt it , yore great grandfather said . Now go and sin no more . And if I eveh ketch you misleading the sons of Ham again , I 'll introduce you to the proper Wrath of God . Chicken walked away with his tail between his spindly legs . He was a little pore feller , sorter gray in the face and weaseleyed . I did n't feel sorry fur him then , Uncle Pink said , but I wish I had . I never took no heed of how he must 've felt . He 'd been whupped down fur so long . Then he got a chance to tell the niggers what to do  --  but even the niggers would n't listen to him . And they 'd listen to Old Gand 's Chosen Cawdor . At the beginning of the wah , I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some white trash about Gen'l Stuart ridin ' around McClellan . By jing ! he says , thar 's a gen'l fur you . Cai n't whup Ole ' eh ! I 'm gon na jine his comp'ny . I wuz born in Vurginny anyways . These yere Lubbers ' round hyear makes me sick ! Then they began to plague him : Well , Cunnel Cruppy , when you gon na jine Ole Jeb 's cavalreh ? Soon 's I kin git me a good hawss , he says . Finally , nobody saw him for a long time . He showed up after the wah with an ole bar'l hoop swohd hangin ' from his middle by a piece of curtain cord . Whur you been , Cunnel Cruppy  --  with Ole Jeb ? Shore have , Chicken says . ( He did n't git the name Chicken till after the wah , when he went to the nigger legislature . ) Fit the Yanks to a standstill  --  onleh trouble they do n't know when they whupped . What battles you been in , Cunnel Cruppy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlanta and Vicksbuhg , Chicken says . Shore fit heaveh ! Hawss was kilt out frum undeh me in Pickett 's Chahge ! Shiloh and Donelson and Atlanta and Vicksburg were all in the west ; and Jeb was with the Army of Northern Virginia in the east  --  besides Shiloh and Donelson were fit and lost ' fore Chicken eveh left Caldwell.  | Shore got quare swohds in Jeb 's cavalreh , Cunnel Cruppy , peoplesaid . Thet thar swohd 's drunk Nankee blood , Chicken said . Hit 's bitdeep in Yankeemeat . People laughed in his face until the Loyal League came . You could see how he would hate ' em . Barns commenced burnin ' all oveh Gadkin county . Eveh man that eveh pestered Chicken had a burnt barn . THAT boy , the silly stupid lad , had been pumping the organ badly  --  and I went back there to tell him about it . He looked at me with that empty face of his , and I picked up the bread knife . I could have killed him with relish , Wagnal said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Stuart riding that black stallion she had seen him on in Richmond when she was fourteen  --  two years before I knew her and she had had him in her heart all the tune  --  and everything was clean and new , not too new , for Katherine 's riding habit would be blown by the wind and falling in careless folds over the horse and the horse furniture and all the leather would be seasoned and live and dark and rich with polishing and use . Stuart 's uniform would be new with fine firegilt buttons and light blue facings on his Confederate Major-General 's coat and the leaves and stars on his collar shining out in confounding brilliance from underneath his great auburn Zeusbeard and his black plume waving under the gold Palmetto star on his caughtup softfelt hat . They were riding at the head of a long troop of men and women all in brilliant colors , red and gold , blue and silver , emerald and yellow , all on sleek horses from dappled gray to purple black . And all the people were young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherries on the tree are young  --  all firm in tightstuffed , finecolored hides  --  all with firm springy haunches . All eagle-eyed and vivacious , all ridingthrough the great grassed meadows of heaven to the jingling of the spurs and creaking of the leather and the little chains and metals of the harness . All talking softly and pleasantly or daringly and dashingly or singing or smiling and laughing . The women 's eyes were bright and deep with the light of invitation and the men 's eyes were warm andp237eager  --  all happy and easy and wild and free , with no consequences . Never any fatigue lying in wait  --  never any nausea  --  never any recriminations . I saw Katherine riding through the great meadows and paddocks of heaven and I saw Stuart riding there beside her as plainly as I now see that cheap print of The Night Watch and that dingy oil lamp . By God , it was not right that I , who had worshipped and protected and loved the girl since sixtythree in Mississippi , should see her riding through the Elysian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this miserable , bleak , cramped little town in a stale smelling little stone temple mediating with God for a people who did not care for God , or Heaven , or Christ  --  a people who cared only that the Protestant Episcopal Church had the reputation of being the most stylish church in the town . There was the silly stupid face of the organ-pumping boy , whose duty it was to send wind through the empty bellows so that a none too agile organist who believed that the Poet and Peasant overture was the ne plus ultra of musical composition , could wheeze out a genteel noise from the musty pipes for the faceless , rustic , little , socialclimbing fools who stood croaking in the pewspaces . No . I did not consider offering this stupid windpushing boy to God as a sacrifice . I said to myself : I shall just get rid of this ugly personification of stupidity . I shall transmuteit back to earth again and let the real wind blow over it  --  let the birdfartings be blown from the belfry . I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had not been for that . But I said , Look here , boy , you pump that organ properly or I 'll slit that throat of yours  --  and it wo n't be a neat incision . Wagnal chuckled sourly : The boy scuttled out of there  --  and bloody fast I can tell you . And next Sunday they sent the town marshal to pump the organ . The old fool had that pearl-mounted pistol strapped to his belly and he puffed like a locomotive . But after the boy had gone that day , I knelt down and prayed God that he would take me to Katherine then and there  --  and that he would take Stuart away from her . Then I got up and drove the knife at the Major-General J. E. B. Stuart , C.S.A . on the bronze  --  you can still see the scratches . Everything was quiet  --  I knelt down again and must have been three hours on my knees thinking and praying . I could feel the empty church around me and the cool stone walls and the empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unmown backlawn of the church . Everything was motionless and quiet and sunfrozen and all my days were rigid pictures in my head flipping over like the peepshows in a penny arcade  --  but with no illusion of motion . Katherine on the stairs in Mississippi looking down on Clint Belton and me ; I on the stairs looking down on Katherine who looked like a flower opening ; Sleepy Bates in the tent as he looked when he said , I do n't mind bein ' shot at but not thataway ; the Crimean telling about blowing the Sepoy from a gun . But God did not speak to me or give me a sign . From that day onward I began to think : There is no God , or , if there is a God , it is something on which I had not reckoned  --  it is something which is blind and cruel , running in a set of cosmic grooves like a Leviathanic shute-the-shutes . Something with no humor but unconscioushumor , something whose finest irony is mere accident wedded to chance . They  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cognizance of one small atom of the earth around them , began to say I was mad . Why , by the body of Christ , boy , how could they judge ? Had they even a splatter of the gray matter , the wherewithal with which to become mad ? You can not conjure madness out of a cabbage . You cannotcraze a block of wood with an axe . You can not blow the brains from a squash . You can not sell such a fine fierce commodity as madness and pass it over a grocer 's counter . All you can buy here is cabbage cunning from the village lawyer , that wooden product , commonsense , you can have by the cord , for the hauling . But madness ! Ho , boy ! How many Hamlets are there here ? It makes not a damn which way the wind blows , they all know a hawk from a handsaw every day in the week and Sunday too . You ca n't fool them . You can bet your bottom dollar on that . Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homely wisdom . None was born on April First . They all know their ass from a hole in the ground . They 're nobody 's fool . And why  --  for what have they stored up all this sanity and commonsense ? Why ? Why ? Why ? Wagnal 's voice quieted and he went on softly sibilant , again almost whispering , with his eyes faraway . Burrus , the jackleg lawyer , whose dignity was beaten out of him by those red and black nightshirts down in Mississippi  --  they may have been ghosts of the Confederate dead from Shiloh or Chickamauga or only frustrated men who had never had any niggers or money or finep239women or any pretense to dignity to lose , who thought then , after the war : The war done it . I woulda been a big man , if it want fur the war , if it want fur the Yankees  --  Burrus had a wife . She was the one who cheated Una out of her kingdom  --  rather , she was the instrument . Tall , rawboned , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had once taken a deep wound in her soul or that she thought she had been bilked of her just deserts in life , she was not altogether homely . But she was a nymphomaniac shrew . Her tongue was a claque for herself , and she whined and whimpered all the time at Burrus , who was not as tall as she and harried with the duties of the trading-post , in which she would not help ( she would never turn a hand to keep his house well either ) , and the purpose of revenge which he had begun to plan against those dealers of nocturnal justice , those men who had judged him and beaten him into a cringing bleedingbackedanimal down in Mississippi . Burrus was trying to save money . Perhaps the idea was to hire enough Pinkerton spies to go down there and find out the names underneath that red and black flannel and calico , whose boots those were that looked just like any other shoeleather wearingout  --  and , oh , with loving tenderness he thought of this  --  whose hand and arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a spirit of an avenging God . Who , in Christ 's name , he muttered , are they to judge me ? To brush me a little  --  to touch me up ! Because I did not own a lot of niggers and talk with a mouthful of mush , because I did not sweat my dollars out of a nigger 's hide , because I did not have a change of luck in the quarters behind the big house , I ai n't a gentleman  --  I ai n't fitten to set at the table and talk to them Goddamn ' ladies a theirn . All I 'm fit for is for a dozen-onta-one to take out and beat like I was the dirt under their feet . And maybe I can reely do somethin ' fur the Indians like Mr. Lincoln done fur the niggers . When the Pinkerton spies had found them , maybe Burrus did n't know what he would do . Maybe he had guns loaded or blacksnake whips stashed away and a gang of paid cronies to help him . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pinkertons had already sniffed at the dragon 's trail  --  whether or not they were right is another matter . They were General McClellan 's secret service in that campaign which ended up in the Seven Days around Richmond  --  and they kept telling him that there were a hundred thousand Rebels on I hand to blast him off the map , with the result that Richmond was saved by half that number . But it was the letters which came from the Pinkerton operative from Washington , where he thought he had run one of Burrus 's chastisers to earth in the Senate  --  it was the letters : Burrus always took them , read them secretly and hid them from his wife . But one day she saw a postmark . She thought Una was writing to her husband . From that day on she grew silent . She thought and lay awake at night brooding and listening to the coyotes howling as she planned out what to do . That took a while . Meantime , Burrus , who had grown used to her shrewishness , naggingand whining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was keeping the accounts , and lidding down his madonna eyes and slanting them off to the floor , said aloud to himself : What 's wrong with her now ? What have I done now ? Oh , Burrus would have done it all right , if he thought he could . But he could never really conceive himself as Una 's lover . Maybe that first night when she beat down his fee to less than half of what he had decided to ask , maybe , leaving the house in Lafayette Square , he had tried to imagine himself with enough money , enough cleverness , enough good looks to go into the bedroom of a woman like that and get into bed with her and put his arms around her and kiss her . But he could n't even turn the knob of the bedroom door  --  and when he thought of her with her clothes off his inward eye dazzled and he could see nothing . It was that she was so damned beautiful and remote that little Burrus could n't believe she did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it . He almost concluded that she would have some goddesslikeway of contactless fornication . He must have known that while he was looking at her breasts in that evening gown  --  that look which cost him five hundred dollars  --  he must have known that he was gulled even as he began to look . So when his wife began to look at him in silence , how could he imagine that she had flattered him the way she had ? Una 's lover ! Good God , Burrus , a draggletailed , usurious little army sutler , a petty carpetbagger , a hardscheming , fruitless little conycatcher . When he did find out , even after he was ruined and his dearest plans to run the nightshirtswho had humiliated him to earth and make them eat their own medicine had gone by the board , even then he felt a coldhot chill ofp241pride up and down his spine . And perhaps , for a moment , then , he could have been Una 's lover . But how could he know what that woman of his was thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange enough to him . She could nag and howl and scream at him all day and then climb , naked and hot and speaking tenderly , into bed with him . She decided . She wrote Una an anonymous letter , cancelled the stamp with the postmark of the trading-post herself and saw it off with her own hand . Stay away from other pepul 's husbands you dirty disrepablehuzy you are worse than those Women of Babylon kep in luxry and jewels My Husban is a good Man and loves Me but he has been Tempt . A Wronged Lady , it was signed . How she expected to conceal who she was that way , nobody ever knew . There are many who must be coy in everything it has not been given them to make anything but a twisted move , perhaps because they have been born twisted and then so twisted by life . Cora began watching the incoming mails with the silent fury of a foxbitch . Do not believe that Una ignored the anonymous letter . Oh no . She was in no position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelt trouble . Though she had married a shrewd enough lawyer , and had come of a cold shrewd family which had always followed the main chance even in its vices , she was bearing the awesome burden now of reducing the queen of the capital to the undeniable position of lady-inwaiting  --  shewanted it definitely known that Mrs. Sprague was second fiddle . She wished passionately to have it set down as an irrefutable fact . As , in the penal code , it is required that the physician stand , his ears plugged with the black buttons of the stethoscope , his hand guiding the microphonic diaphragm over the thorax of the thing that hangs blackhooded at the end of inertia , until there is no further roar or flutter in his ears , in the same way Una required that she be recognized as the Toast of Washington . But she was not satisfied with the social stethoscopeheld once or twice in the ears of two or three society reporters . She wished the rival pronounced dead and buried in the quicklime of social oblivion . Something definite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the chamber and the case held up that she might say : See , it is empty . Because she was working thus towards her coronation , she had little time to consider curiously the letter from Fort Sofa . And , of course , she did not show it to Clint , for she had never told him of her dealings with Burrus . Clint was prone to be too cautiousand would not have approved so dangerous a deal . Thus it was that she did write Burrus the first time she had ever written him , telling him of the anonymous letter and warning him to be careful that nothingcame to light . Cora , the shrew with the evil , unpigmented eye , was there alone that morning when the halfbreed brought in the mailbag . She had caught Burrus out by some shrew 's trick or other that day . The halfbreedlaid the bag on the counter and she quickly gave him a bottle of Hostetter 's Bitters and said , git ! sharply . Even while she was still staring at the worn leather ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furiousfoxlike joy that inside this canvas and leather , in which there were a few mailorder catalogs , some bills , a Butterick pattern or two , there was one letter that would feed her jealous wrath . She could feel it there . She had it out of the bag , the padlock relocked and the seal diddled into a semblance of unbroken-ness  --  anyway the seals had often been broken in transit ; Burrus suspected the halfbreed  --  and was in the bedroom with a chairback under the doorknob , leaving the store and post office empty , before Burrus got back . It was just the kind of a letter that would feed her jealousy . She derived a good deal of satisfaction from it because it was vague : Dear Mr. Burrus :  --  I have received an anonymous letter postmarked , Fort Sofa , in which you and I figure in a ridiculous affair of the heart . As my attorney , I wish you would look into this discreetly  --  and also do what you are able to safeguard my pecuniary interests . I trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was written on paper with the Theron griffon , lion and crocodile on it  --  finer paper than Cora had ever seen . Mr. Burrus ! she said to herself . Mr. Burrus , indeed ! She may as wella said Dear Honeybunch . And her pee-cunnarryinterests ! Cora had never seen the word before and , instead of connecting it with money she connected it with lechery . And as far as askenserned , she muttered at the Theron stationery , I bet she ai n't true to him . Them Washington wimmin lifts their skirts to anyone that takes their fancies . Her eyes began to burn with passion as she said the words to the walnut commode . She stuck the letter behind the round picture of the horses ' heads and went into the store where Burrus was opening the mail sack . When 'd this come , Cory ? Oh , the mail sack ? she said . Little bit ago . Joe brought it . That halfbreed ! Burrusp243said fingering the seal . I give him some of that medicine , Cora said . Ummm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slanted a look at the gray pine floor . Looking up for a minute , he saw the hot , wild look in her eyes and something else . Then he knew she had got something out of the mailbag . It must , he thought , have been one of the reports from Pinkerton 's . And he did not wish to tell her , now , at least , perhaps not ever , what he was planning . She did not know about the nightshirts and the blacksnake  --  he had said the stripes on his back were where a livery nag had dragged him under a harrow . He wanted to remain secret and obscure as possible about his humiliation in Mississippi until he had brought that red nightshirt to its knees and inflicted upon it some intense bitterness that would sour its soul for the rest of its days . After that maybe he could find some way to make the nightshirt 's bitterness public . A nigger in that Washington hotel saw his bloody shirt . Gand A'mighty , Cap'n , you ai n't been Kloo Kluxed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . The night of the day she stole the letter Cora took him to bed fiercely and held him hard against her biting him and whispering steamily in his ears . He had no time or energy left to figure out how he was going to get the Pinkerton letter away from her  --  or what he was going to tell her about the semi-code it was written in . He was worn out the next day  --  and that night she acted the same way . He was trying to go to sleep when she said : Burrus , this woman in Warshington , D. C.  --  she ai n't purty as I am , is she ? What woman ? Burrus said  --  although he knew that even if he had only looked at Una to the tune of five hundred dollars , there was only one woman for him in Washington . She ai n't as good to be in bed with as me , is she ? Cora said . What woman ? Burrus said . His vanity began to feed a little even then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't any woman . Do n't you play possum with me . Cory , Burrus said , I do n't know any woman in Washington but Mrs. Belton that I done business for about her ess-tate . Ah , Cora said , you done business for her all right  --  monkey business . You done the business in bed with her . In bed ? Burrus said . I only been in her house twice : once when I settled her ess-tate an ' once when she got me  --  us this tradership . God ! Cora said . She takes care a her men like all gitout , do n't she ? She sure keeps ' em in fine style  --  makes her ole man give ' em post-traderships . Burrus , I would n't ever a-thought you'd a let a woman keep you . No woman 's keepin ' me ! Burrus yelled . Why , Goddamnit , Cora , no woman 's ever kep me . I pay out good hardearneddollars for this place . Oh , she said , you do ? Well , it 's the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought we kep it all . I thought we was a-saving to reetire in our old age . Burrus , where 's that money ? What bank 's it in ? If you do n't tell me , I 'll tell you what I 'll do  --  I 'll write to President Grant himownself and tell him that woman 's been a-usin ' gover'ment fun 's to keep her men like the Whore of Babylon she is . Cory , for God 's sake ! Burrus said . He took a long sigh . After a while , during which all he could hear was her fast wheezy breath , he said : All the money we got that 's ours is in the bank . I kep tellin ' you in the beginning there 's arrangements you got to make to git a tradership  --  an ' they cost money . So , Cora said , there 's arrangements , is they ? Well , Burrus , the only arrangement I ever heard about was a female arrangement back in Warshington . So you 're a-keepin ' her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while she 's in bed all the time with another man  --  or God knows how many men . You ai n't a-gitting much out of it , are you ? Cory , Burrus said , slowly with pauses between the words , it 's nothin ' but business , I tell you . To git one of these posts you got to give back half the profit . It 's business  --  pure business ! It 's business , all right , Cora said . You can call it pure if you want to , but I got another name for it . I seen that kinda business done in redlight houses when I was ten years old , but it only cost them men two dollars and sometimes only a dollar  --  and them wimmin ' was gittin ' good money fer it , takin ' into consideration who they was . But you , her voice came in a tight hardhiss , you ! You got ta go to , Warshington , Dee Gee , and git yourself a hightone hussy that does you out of half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works herself grayheaded for you and takes care of you good  --  a purty wife , if I do say it myself as should n't . Maybe it took her two or three days and nights to tell him about the anonymous letter she had written to Una  --  and about the letter from Una . Give them to him ? Oh no ! Not her . Not Cora . If he was to leave her for that whore of Babylon in Washington , she 'd have something to hold over him . Those days and nights must have been a hell for Burrus : Every time Cora got to talking about Una being a Whore of Babylon , she would whip herself into the frenzy of a bitchp245in heat and go for him so wildly that he could not refuse  --  until the night he was worn out . He shoved her away from him and got out of the bed , leaving her stringy , hot , imperative passion to claw the sheets . She got up after a while and walked into the parlor where he was lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold hate . He felt it , though his eyes were shut . Maybe it was that night she wrote the letter to the Senate : Ther is a skarlet Woman seling tradding posts in Warshington to keep her and her men in sin I know becaus my husband bout one He is her lover too Cora Burrus . She sent it the next day  --  and that night she crawled into bed naked and pulled Burrus 's nightshirt off him again . As I said , Clint did n't know that Una had sold the post to Burrus . He thought it was some sort of a reward  --  a chunk of the spoils for settling the estate in Mississippi . There was a point in cunning at which Clint 's mind stopped  --  a point where , for all the clear planning he had done , he grew fatuous and inexplicable in an inhuman way . It was as if the scheming-machine , the clever , foreseeing groundear , the photoelectriccell was made to a certain gauge and would work only within that gauge 's limits . A personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend  --  a henchman , let us say  --  on the Senate committee came to him with the news that it would be moved to impeach him the next ( lay , because Mrs. Belton stood accused of selling a post-tradership to a man named Burrus , a carpetbagger and a jackleg lawyer who had been flogged out of Mississippi by the Ku Klux ( the committeeman a Democrat knew this ) , the Eye of Mars that was used to threaten and command , grew momentarily like the eye of an ox bumped on the head by a stockyards hammer . It was in the morning and Una was not up . Even under this stress , however , he knocked on her door . Who is it ? Una said coldly through the door . Murphy  --  this was her maid  --  have I not told you never to disturb me before eleven on any account ! Now go . Una ! Clint said . Una ! Oh , she said . Well ? I must see you . It 's important ! Well , she said slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in bed , the pink silk coverlet all around her . There was a little sleep-puffiness about her face  --  and Clint thought it lent the illusion of warmth her coolness needed . Well , Clinton ? she said . Una , my darling , Clint said . You had some dealings with a fellow namedp246Burrus . Did you  --  did you get any  --  ah  --  consideration for that tradershipat Fort Sofa ? Una stared at him as if he were the lowest sort of fool . Really , Clint , you did n't suppose the little carpetbagger got it free , did you ? Do n't you know that such things are part of our legitimate income ? Had n't you thought of that ? How is a woman in my position to keep up her obligations ? But Una , dear , Clint said , they found out . Mrs. Burrus wrote the Senate a letter and a Democrat got hold of it . They 'll move to impeach me today . God , Una said , that bloody woman . She thought I wanted her little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? Clint said . She pointed at the gilt escritoire : There 's pen and ink there . Write out your resignation quickly , take it to Grant and make him accept it before they can take action . You 've still got time to do that . That will check them , stalemate them , take their breath away . Act maligned to Grant . Swear to God it 's not true . Tell him it 's a Democratic plot . Ask him if he thinks me capable of such a base act . Remind him of the good old days in the Army of Tennessee and ask him if he thinks such a good soldier as yourself who had such nice Havanas and liquor could possibly be mixed up in such a scandal as selling post-traderships . Over Una 's perfectly modulated voice there fell a thin membrane of sneering . Clint heard it all right , but he was busy writing the short resignation . There was no time to adopt an attitude toward the voice of the woman he had married . In ten minutes he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine team could run . THE DAY General Grant was inaugurated Mr. Beckham came to supper with Papa , and he said it was just bully now they had a man like General Grant to run the country . The Hero of Appomattox would show these politicians what a soldier could do . As for himself , Mr. Beckham had been out of the war when General Grant took command of the Army of the Potomac , but the boys from his regiment , the Fighting Ninety-seventh Pennsylvania Zouaves , said General Grant was hunky dory . Myra liked to listen to him when he talked with his head thrown back like that and his beard so black and silky . Papa said that , yes , General Grant would probably make a goodp247president and that he had known General Grant both in the Mexican war and the Civil war and that he was a very unassuming man . Papa seemed to be thinking a good deal about it but not saying much . But then Papa never said much . One day Myra had heard him say to Brother Ream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will not quote the Bible to you , son , for I know young men do not like Biblical advice , but remember that man is a tentative image of a god . Myra did not quite understand what Papa meant , but my , oh , my ! how she admired him and loved him . Why , she did n't believe she had ever heard Papa speak a cross word to anyone in her whole life  --  and the Lord knows he had had provocation often enough . And how Ring and the horses and even the silly sheep loved Papa . And it was plain to see that Mr. Beckham worshipped the ground that Papa walked on . While they were eating supper something happened that was embarrassingin a way and made her feel kind of proud in another . That old Osage  --  well , he was n't really old and not a bad-looking fella for an Indian  --  came up to the house with his painted up pony with the bright colored rags and stick-candy braided in his mane , and Papa had to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . When Papa came back to his supper , he was smiling . And he smiled first at Ma and then at Myra . Well , Lorna , he said , you almost lost a daughter , but I was too sharp a horse-trader for the chief . Well , Mr. Hanks ? Ma said , her dark eyes shining like berries . The chief brought his best pony to trade for Myra  --  and when I refused that he offered me six more and a couple of squaws to boot . He said , hair like blackbird wing . Myra blushed and said , Oh , Papa ! And Mr. Beckham said , loudly , You just bet your bottom dollar the chief knew what he was doing all right ! After he had said that Mr. Beckham 's face got a little red , but Papa said something about General Grant 's home in Galena , Illinois or somewhere and building a side walk and a house for the General that saved the situation . During the rest of the meal Myra could feel Mr. Beckham looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his brother who was in the Pennsylvania Cavalry during the war and said now that they 'd put General Grant in the Capital maybe the old soldiers would get their rightful pensions . But Myra could see that he was thinking about her all the time . Afterwards Brother Ream said : Well , Myry , you could just land a beau in the middle of the Sahara desert . And Myra could see that Hetty was a little jealous , but she said Mr. Beckham seemed to be a fine upright young man . And Ellen looked at her kind of sad and yearning like in her eyes . The very next morning as Papa was getting ready to go to the store the Osage came again . This time he was a-riding his painted up pony and had a whole herd of ponies  --  about thirty  --  following him , Myra saw him ride up to Papa and hold out his hand and then get off the pony under the pecan tree and talk and motion with Papa for a long time  --  about a half an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright blanket and he was taller than Papa and Mr. Beckham and so straight . Finally he got back on his painted up pony in a kind of stiff strained way ; and Papa stood there beside the wagon in the yard looking out toward the Lombardy poplars and the silverleaf maples where the ponies were raising the dust as they followed the Indian , nickering and blowing , down the road . Papa turned and walked toward the house when the parade got a piece down the road . He walked into the house smiling . Myra , he said , Myra , you must know how much your Papa thinks of you now . Myra laughed , feeling a funny glow all over her and kissed Papa on the whiskers that were n't as nice now as they were before he came back from that awful old Andersonville prison , but were still nicer than anybody 's because they were her Papa 's . Oh , no , she said . Not all them horses , Papa ! Not all those ponies ! That old Indian ! Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've little doubt it was everything the poor Indian owned . Papa went out and got up on the wagon smiling to himself . And even if she did say that old Indian , she kept thinking of his dark sharp eyes and the way he looked at her  --  and she thought it was kind of sad , even if he was only an Indian and just a savage . Tom Beckham was standing in the door of the store looking out over the flat country to the east , thinking about Brother Joe and him swimming behind Pap 's barge in Canal street back in Manayunk before the war and Molly and the girl in Richmond that night after Savage 's Station  --  and Myra Hanks . He was just standing there thinkingand chewing tobacco when that fellow Sipperly drove up in front of an old log house across the street  --  if you could call it a street.  |p249Si|p|perly  had a good-looking team of horses hitched to a spring wagon and there were several good sized kegs in the wagon . Sipperly waved enthusiastically to Tom . Tom waved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ log house and began helping Sipperly unload the kegs . Several Osages hung around and watched the process with dark and avid eyes . Tom wondered what in the Jesus that Sipperly customer was up to now . Not that Tom minded a drink of liquor  --  no , many 's the time he 'd gone pub-crawling with the boys in Philadeffy , but with a bunch of Indians aroundCaptain Hanks drove up and got down from his spring wagon . Good morning , Tom , Captain Hanks said . Good morning , Captain Hanks . Every time Tom looked at Captain Hanks he thought what a grand man he was . Why , by Jesus Christ , there was a man who had been in two wars and in Andersonville prison and all over the country  --  and what was more a well-read man too , a scholar  --  and he did n't crack himself up to be any better than any other man . Captain Hanks was smiling to himself when he walked up to Tom . Tom , he said , I turned down a chance to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How 's that , Captain ? Tom said , in his most important voice . Well , sir , that Osage came back this morning with his whole herd of ponies and wanted to trade them for my daughter , Myra ,  --  and what is more , he offered to throw in a half dozen squaws to boot . When I turned him down , he went away heartbroken . An ' by God ! he 'd a got the best of the bargain , Captain ! Tom said , hotly , speaking before he thought and turning a real red under his beard . The captain smiled at him and said : That 's what I thought , too , Tom . But it would n't do to tell Myra . Mawnin ' , Judge Hanks ! Sipperly was standing in the sunlight with his eyes squinted up . One of the Indians was helping the halfbreed unload the kegs while Sipperly watched . Captain Hanks bowed and said gravely , Good morning , Mr. Sipperly . He did n't say anything to Tom , and the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just who is that Sipperly party , Captain Hanks ? Tom said . Well , Tom , Captain Hanks said , I do n't know much about Mr. Sipperly except that he says he was in the Army of the Potomac . He talks of fighting at Gettysburg , and he says he fought Indians after the war in the regular army . In any case , he still wears the army blue . I would n't be a Goddamn ' bit supprized if he was a skedaddler , Captain Hanks ! Tom blurted . Well , Tom , I do n't know  --  I do n't know . The captain looked worried and walked away from Tom toward the packing box desk at the back of the store . At noon he told Tom that he would be riding to Independence early tomorrow morning . Because he lived and bached in the back of that old store , Myra brought some dinner down to Mr. Beckham . For with Papa away in Independence , Mr. Beckham would n't really be able to get his own dinner and tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Caesar down with a package of dinner for him . Well , that 's just boss , Miss Hanks  --  just boss ! Mr. Beckham said in his bluff way . And she went back to the stove in the back of the store and heated her biscuits and made some tea for him because he could n't drink coffee since the war , him being on Bell 's Island like Papa was in Andersonville . Mr. Beckham said that her biscuits were just ay number one firstrate bully and he 'd heard that that Osage had tried to trade the captain out of her  --  and that maybe the only good Indian was a dead Indian . But you could just bet your bottom dollar that was one time an Indian knew what he was a-doing . Myra got a little pink ; she could feel it . So she said right quick : What were them old Indians doing over there in that old shack that Milt Gaby had built . She saw three of them going in as she rode up to the store . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Slipperly fellow  --  Sipperly , Myra said ; Sipperly , Mr. Beckham repeated  --  it looked as if he had a few kegs of firewater over there . Oh my , Myra said , that ai n't safe ! Well , by Jesus , Mr. Beckham said , getting excited , I did n't like that Slippery 's  --  Sipperly , Myra said  --  Sipperly 's looks the first time I saw him with that boy tied on the horse up to you Papa 's place . Looked like a Goddamn '  --  excuse me , Miss Hanks  --  skedaddler or a bounty-jumper to me . Well , my , oh my ! Myra said , I must get back home . You 'd better let me close the store and ride with you , Mr. Beckham said . No , Mr. Beckham , thank you ,  |p251Myra  said . There 's no horse here . Well , I could take you up on the pummel , Mr. Beckham said . But she said she would go alone , and just as she was going out that halfbreed that hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. Beckham had to wait on him . And though she heard Mr. Beckham say if she 'd wait a minute , he 'd help her on her horse , she went out and was about to get on Old Caesar when the Osage came up . His dark eyes were burning with a kind of worshipful look in them and he did n't say a word , but just walked up to her , his moccasins making not a sound , and took hold of one of the braids of her black purply hair and felt of it and then he took the other in his other hand and felt of it . At first Myra was n't really afraid , for he did n't do anything at all but just stand there and look at her as if he was a little bit of a boy looking at a cookie or a piece of stick candy . She was just so fascinated that she did n't do anything either  --  did n't even back away from him until she smelled the liquor on his breath . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Osage let go of her hair and looked at her so sad and then all the expression went out of his eyes and he staggered across the street where Sipperly was . Just as she said : Mr. Beckham ! again and louder another Osage galloped his pony in front of the store and let out a couple of screams . Mr. Beckham ran out of the store with no hat on and his beard blowing back . Oh , Mr. Beckham , Myra said . Them old Indians are drunk . That old Sipperly got them drunk . That old Osage came right up to me and took a-hold of my hair braids . He smelt just like a whiskey bottle ! He did , did he ? Mr. Beckham said , his eyes getting wild . Well , by Jesus H. Christ , where is he ? He went in that shack , Myra said . You go in the store , Myra , honey ! Mr. Beckham said fast , his eyes flashing . And lock the door inside . But , Mr. Beckham ! Myra said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost dragged her into the store . She locked the door from the inside , and watched Mr. Beckham stalk across to the shack through the window . He was limping a little with his left leg , but his shoulders were thrown back and his beard was blowing a little in the wind . He walked right in the shack , not even bothering to close the door . It could n't have been more than a minute until Sipperly shot out of the open door in the dust  --  and Mr. Beckham came out after him with his fists doubled up . Mr. Beckham came out all bent forward with his eyes wide open and starey . He leant over Old Sipperly  --  and he was talking loud : By Jesus , no one can call me a name like that ! You let me catch you selling any more liquor to the Indians , by God Almighty ! and I 'll take a musket to you ! Then she saw Mr. Beckham grab him by the arm just as the smoke and flash came out of his sleeve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat him on the wrist something shiny flew out into the center of the road . Mr. Beckham shoved him down in the dust , not even looking backward at the two Osages who had come to the open door , and walked to the center of the road and picked up the little pistol . Then he turned around and said : And I 'm a-going to give you till tomorrow to close up  --  and then I 'm a-going to fetch the United States Marshal ! He put the little pistol in his pants pocket and came over to the store door . Myra unlocked it and let him in . My , oh my ! Mr. Beckham , she said , that 's just awful . You mighta been killed a-fooling around with that old Sipperly . My , oh my ! her voice was almost hysterical . Where is that old gun ? Where is that pistol ? Mr. Beckham locked up the store and put her on the pommel of the saddle and rode old Caesar back to the farm . She made him give her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver trimmings made in Nashville , Tennessee . And Mr. Beckham said Sipperly was probably a Copperhead or a Rebel . But anyway she and Mamma hid the Derringer pistol and Papa 's Colt 's pistol and Papa 's rifle and shotgun , because they were afraid  --  Mr. Beckham was so excited ! He was just in a condition to go out and shoot somebody . After they 'd hid the guns , she saw Mr. Beckham 's poor wrist was all blue gray and spotted . It turned out to be powder burns ; and she and Mamma did it up in lard . And Myra said : My , oh my , Mamma ! I just did n't realize how near Mr. Beckham was to being killed . Mr. Beckham , do n't you darest to do any sich a thing ever again on my account ! Late that night Papa came in with Mr. Ernie Stewart . While theyp253were having some supper in the kitchen , Myra told Papa what had happened . Well , Myra , Papa said , Mr. Stewart has arrested Sipperly . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as I could after I found out Sipperly was selling liquor to the Indians . Where did you put that old Sipperly ? Myra asked . Now , Myra , honey , Papa said . Do n't you worry . Mr. Stewart and I secured him well . Just then Mr. Beckham came into the kitchen  --  he had n't even undressed to lie down , Myra could see  --  and began to tell Papa now that he was home , that he , Mr. Beckham , would have to start for the marshal . Then Papa introduced him to Mr. Stewart and told him about them having secured Sipperly . And though Mr. Beckham looked a little disappointed , he said that was bully ! Captain Hanks was always a jump ahead of everybody in everything . Myra told him to take off his clothes when he went back to bed so he could sleep comfortably . And she went back to bed and could n't sleep for a long time for thinking of the Indian holding onto her braids and Mr. Beckham calling her , Myra , honey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And she wondered if it was son of a bitch that Sipperly had called Mr. Beckham . GRANT had already heard . Una was right : Grant could not believe what they were saying of Mrs. Belton . Poor Rawlins , dead a long time now , yet it seemed but yesterday that he had stood in front of the tentflap saying in a breathless intense preacher-like voice : You know your weakness , Grant . You know also , Grant , that you can let liquor alone . Yes ; it was that day the man made the photograph of him , MajorGeneralUlysses S. Grant , leaning against the tree with one hand . He looked , that day , the most like Old Zack in Mexico and he was proud of it . Well , I have done it . I am greater than Old Zack now : It was a bigger war , and I am President of the United States too  --  and there are more states . The times are buried now when I was a cashiered drunk who could n't pay his bills . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys I knew at the academy . And so many at Cold Harbor  --  so many farmer boys like me when Ma used to call me Lys back in Ohio . They used to sew their names on their jackets at Cold Harbor so their mothers could find them . But Rawlins was not there , Wagnal said , and if he had been , I doubt that he would have told Grant to act differently . He would have remembered Clint 's civil manner and the cigars  --  and what man of them could have suspected that Una was what she was . Grant remembered the tents in Tennessee and the home in Burlington . He accepted Clint 's resignation . If he had believed that Una had sold a post-tradership , her selling it would have lent sanctity to the act . For Grant was a worshipper at the Temple of Venus as were all men who saw Una except myself ( who had married Katherine ) and the Crimean and Drumbutt and even the Crimean admired her , for there was something complete about Una which commanded a certainadmiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Clint and walked out of the White House , forgetting that his fine pair of horses was waiting for him . He walked along the riverbank all that afternoon , thinking how he had first met Rawlins in Galena : The soft-tanned calfskin he had tacked to Rawlins 's desk , the years of dusty sweaty summer afternoons and general stores , the years when not even the veriest loafer had given him a second thought , the years when he had given up and a sodden weariness had weighed him down . The day Sumter fell and Rawlins spoke in Galena . And then the years of the war when the simplest statements he made were put in the papers : the note to Buckner demanding unconditional surrender . He saw again the tents  --  not in the winter or the rain  --  but always in moments of spring or early summer , the flaps rolled up , the officers sitting around posed in canvas camp chairs , some leaning theatrically on trees or tentpoles because the photographer had asked them to act natural . Only last night he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered the haircuts , the uniforms , the hands-in-the-pockets attitudes , but he could not remember what he was thinking then . What had I in my mind then ? Was it Rawlins 's talk the night before ? That cornfield at Shiloh where you could n't step on the ground for the dead ? That man , Rome Hanks , that night at the Landing  --  after the first day ? He asked me who was in command . Luck maybe . God ?  |p255How  did I get through those years ? Why am I not dead now of that bullet that struck my scabbard at Shiloh ? But it was better with the army than it is now . Why did I ever let them put me here ? And he thought of the days before Vicksburg on the march and the green around the tents and the smell of horses and leather and black powder and the high sweetsick smell of the fields he fought after the cannon were silent and the muskets cleaned and the boy-blue ranks closed up . And he thought how , all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys of his Army of Tennessee  --  and how those who then had said : hit Rawlins in the head to knock out Grant 's brains , must have voted for him , saying , I was with Grant from Donelson to Vicksburg . I was with Grant at Shiloh ! I saw Grant talking to Pemberton at Vicksburg  --  and they carried off that Goddamn ' tree a piece at a time . But Grant 's acceptance of Clint 's resignation did n't stop the motion for impeachment , Wagnal said . It fell to a Princeton roommate of Clint 's to propose the impeachment . The man 's voice broke for his dear old classmate . There was a fight in the house over whether or not a man whose resignation had been accepted could be impeached . Sympathy for Una ran high . Oh , she played it out with proper strategy and tactics , all right . Everybody began to say that Clint was hiding behind her petticoats . Those women in Knoxville began to say now that poor Mrs. Belton , who had such good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave all those nice parties for the President and the senators  --  and would certainly be a better and more representative woman to have in the White House than the general 's wife  --  that poor Mrs. Belton was a much maligned lady . Yes siree , bob . That husband of hers  --  humph ! If the truth was known he wouldn'ta got anywhere at all if it had n't been for her . The women began to call on Katherine with sweet , mellow , sympathetic faces : These must be trying times for you Mrs. Wagnal  --  but just remember that we all understand . Katherinegave them tea and looked at them , from the eyeslits with the little imprints of voiceless sardonic laughter in her dimples . They were puzzled : they expected her arms around them and the outpouring of grief and sobs and tears ; they expected to give back thickfat tears of smug sympathy . But they got nothing but Katherine 's silent , wildly amused face before them over the teacups . They got not even any acknowledgment that Katherine knew what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . It will be a trial to leave Knoxville : this beautiful old house here , this lovely deep lawn , those dear little iron negroes holding one 's horses  --  and you dear , understanding ladies . It will be a severe trial . All the while they were hearing these words  --  words almost like the words they were used to hearing in similar circumstances , yet with some nuance of mystery , for the house was quite an ordinary old house in their estimation ; and who , of them , gave a tuppenny damn for the little iron niggers ,  --  they saw Katherine 's Age of Innocence face teeteringon the edge of wild laughter which they knew would come at their expense  --  and some way or other , to their disgrace . Who and what was this woman who made them all look so tacky and feel all thumbs ? But they would not retreat . Their feline intuition may have been strong enough to tell them of their coming humiliation , but they were country cats . They would not be warned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we left . They brought quilts and handkerchiefsand fancy work bedspreads as farewell gifts to Katherine . They were a church society of some sort . Katherine sat them down and gave them tea , listening to their chatter and smiling that smile that every moment threatened to be laughter . Oh , they finally brought up the subject of poor Una again  --  as if it had been clumsily plotted to seem natural when they made up the farewell party : Such an awful time moving and all . Sich terrible things happen to everybody  --  good honest people too  --  these days . People jist do n't know where misfortune will strike next . More tea ? Katherine would say . Oh yes , it will be a tiresome trip . But Fork City has such a charming little church  --  stone with little Gothic windows and a wooden vestry . They could n't stand it any longer . It happened , Katherine said , as if by pre-arranged signal . Now , Mrs. Wagnal , the soothing feline voice said , we do n't want you to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news . All our sympathy is for your dear , dainty , beautiful sister . We are sure that she is being persecuted . We do n't believe this horrible thing about her . Katherine 's silent expression broke into a light , derisive laugh . Dear ladies , she said , dear , dear ladies I must warn you not to waste your sympathies on my poor , beautiful , dainty sister . I got my information about my sister 's persecution from the newspapers . I know as little of the details as you do  --  but you may be sure that my poor , dear , beautifulp257sister is as guilty as all of you would be , if you had been equipped with looks and spirit enough to attain her position . Dear ladies , my sister , Una , is a haughty calculating woman , who would not even turn her head to speak a harsh word to one of you . She would sell as many post-traderships as any of you , if you were sure you would not be caught . Now that your idle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trumpery and go . There is no fee for this news . It is quite free . Katherine was still smiling . She did not even stand up . Why , Mrs. Wagnal ! You ai n't serious ! Why , myohmy ! They flutteredand flounced out of the house . Katherine sent the needlework gifts back to them . When I came home , Katherine was sitting on the porch with a glass of brandy in her hand , still laughing . She stood up on her chair and put her arms around my neck  --  and her hair danced around her eyes . And I saw all her brilliant beautiful coloring in the afternoon sun . Burrus said : Good God , woman ! Good God ! Wagnal said . Take the bread out of our mouth and get me put in jail ! You slep with her , Cora said , though this must have been only self-flattery . It was cool , but there was a slick film of ecstatic sweat on her forehead and among the hairs on her upper lip and the three hairs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You fornercated with her . You paid her for it with more money'n I ever seen . You kep her  --  a strumpet in silks and jewlry . Defraud ye not one the other , except it be by consent for a season . But I did n't , I tell ye , Cory , Burrus said . I hope to die if I did . He that committeth fornercation sinneth against his own body ! The Lord , He showeth me the way to save thy soul , Burrus . And the Lord saith write unto Warshington , Dee Cee , which is like unto Babylon and Sodom and Gormorrah  --  and lead them unto the truth . She had nothing on but a dressing-sacque and she threw it off her and stood naked in the store . This is your neckidness , she said . A wife 's neckidness is a husband 's neckidness . An ' every brave an ' halfbreed crittur in the Territory will know your neckidness , Burrus . Burrus got the dressing-sacque back on her and tied her up . He got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ill and could n't be taken to Washington . He left her locked in a room in the house of a quarterbreed midwife and started , alone , for the capital . Clint was never impeached , but he was arrested . Oh , yes . They arrested him , all right , but they did n't put the dashing secretary in jail . Not General Belton ! They put a policeman in front of the house in Lafayette Square and one behind . Clint had it all planned out for him and Una to skip the country . They were to get out on a boat down the Potomac , hit for New Orleans and sail from there to Europe on a forged passport . Una would not hear of it . Oh , she was courageous . Look here , Clinton , she said , we 're staying in Washington . Nothing will come of this . They may say they 're trying to impeach you , but it 's me they 're after . And I never saw a five-for-a-cent senator yet who could bring himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt you , though you may never be president now . It was sleeting . And Una could see the policeman shivering under a tree in front of the house . Go out now , she said , and fetch that man inside . Say , Mrs. Belton and I can not see you so uncomfortable . Bring him in and give him some whiskey , coffee , dinner  --  anything he wants . We need him on our side . One thing can be said for Clint ; he always recognized and adopted superior wisdom or cunning . He went out , fetched the policeman in and gave him a drink and a good dinner . No , sir , the policeman had n't ever believed any of this business about selling post-traderships . Had n't he been in the Army of Tennessee  --  and was n't it many 's the time he 'd seen the General in camp and on the march . Why , by God , he seen the General take that Rebel kernel by the nape of the neck and the seat of the britches  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived to be a hundred . And Missus Belton  --  why the gall of some people ! A beautiful lady like her soilin ' her hands a-sellin ' post-traderships . Una put on her most innocent smile . The next day , as the police guard changed around the house , a reporter accosted the policeman . Had the Beltons tried to escape ? Escape ? the policeman said , fingering the haft of his hickory billy . And why would they want to escape ? They was innocent . They asked him in out of the sleet . They fed him . By God , he could n't do anything to them senators , but he could pound the head off anybody what said a wonderful lady like Missus General Belton  --  or the General who he knew well durin ' the war in the Army a Tennessee  --  coulda done anything like that . Even the jailer of the former Secretary of War and Mrs. Belton believes them innocent . It was a fine story . Una 's fame and popularity were still rising . Poor Burrus arrived at length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not such a fool , really . When he got into Washington , hep259knew what Una would say to the committee , if she were called before them . Mrs. Belton has loaned me money . Yes , sir , I had the honor a bein ' her lawyer . I settled her ess-tate down to Messenger 's Ferry , Mississippi . She loaned me money to git started at the post . He told them that and showed them the certificate of Mrs. Burrus 's illness , pointing sadly to his forehead . Ah ! the committee said , Ah ! Ah , yes ! Of course , under the circumstances , Mr. Burrus could no longer serve as post trader at Fort Sofa . Burrus 's Madonna lids dropped , and he looked slantwise and downward . Oh , it got into the house and senate , all right . They had a fine debate for a couple of months . The few fire-eaters from below the Mason-Dixon line yelled at poor Burrus , calling him a carpetbagger and a skunk . They reminded each other that Belton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blockader and false to the cause that had nourished him . The Tacitus , or the Thucydides , or the Macaulay who writes the annals of our epoch will engrave them with an inexorablepen . Why , now , gentlemen , when a high cabinet officer bolts from office in advance of the charges of corruption , shall the historian add that the Senate used the demand of the people as a farce , and deserted its high functions before the sophistries and jeers of the criminal lawyer ? Clint 's lawyer had jeers and sophistries , all right . Why , Gentlemen of the Senate , are not all the accusers Democrats  --  men who can not forget those glorious fields where they lost by mere misfortune to General Belton 's blind Union luck ? Disgruntled former slaveholders who can not forget the days when they battened on the bloody sweat of their dark brothers held in durance vile  --  the days before General Belton and thousands of his stout-hearted kind marched , at the call of our Great Martyred Liberator , against and vanquished their invidiousso-called democracy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My client was a general in Sherman 's army . Nay , in Grant 's army . It was a matter of politics , in truth , Wagnal said . Clint got a vote for acquittal which followed exactly the Radical Republican majority . For a while , Una was still Queen of Washington  --  and Clint became one of the highest paid lobby lawyers in the capital . Perhaps the setbackon the road to the White House reached some deeply encysted spirit in Una . Perhaps it was only disease brought on by her courtesan 's vanity . In any event , she wore a decollete gown one bitter night and within a week was dead.  |p260Pneumococci  are great levelers of vanity and ambition , Wagnal said . They are batteners upon beauty or hideousness . For these shy retiring microscopic fellows fairfirm beautyflesh is as good as ugly anilemeat or dry white senile tissue  --  meat is meat to them . Ah ! they say hungrily . Human meat is going to a cold party tonight without its coat . Oh ! they say gluttonously . Those shoes ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em  --  and the streets are wet . Do they say : What tender lobes ! What fine breasts  --  only a little cramped from tight-lacing ?  --  if we could only suckle at those rosy paps ? Do they say : We 'll larrup him one in the wind ? No . All they do is burrow in rudely and gorge . They have not even the providence of the Ethiop , who lops one steak from the live bullock . They thrust their hungry gullets down into the live meat and spoil a million meals  --  for they are sure of a million more than they can ever cat . But in Una 's fair lights , they did one thing nothing else had ever done : they raised her heat . With the dry , crepitating rile , there came the warmth she had never felt . She died in hot rigors . The cabinetmembers carried her into St. John 's and out again . A lovesick little bureaucrat-clerk fell into an epilepsy of baroque sorrow on the icy walk . Even Grant looked at her breasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the ladies of Washington turned out for the funeral weeping as joy burst in their hearts to the tune of : I still live and She is dead . There were personal telegrams from three kings and all the great dukes . And Clint , his Eye of Mars wetting for his lost glory and ambition , dwindled suddenly to half the man he had been as the earth hit the coffintop . BUT , Uncle Pink said , pausing and the motion of his tumefactive egg pausing with him , you want to hear about your grandfather and my brother , Jud Harrington . I can scarcely believe it , but Judson and I were at the University of North Carolina for a year  --  well not quite a year , but part of a college year . But I cai n't tell you much about college in those days . To tell you the truth , Jud and me did little or no studyin ' at the university . But it was shore a purty place  --  built around a well and ap261poplar tree . Seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and says : We 'll found us a university hyear  --  but first we got to have a drink . So they tied their hawses to the poplar tree and went oveh to the well to git a chaser for the cawn . Mebbe that ai n't rightmebbethe well was dug later . Fur who eveh hyeard of a scholah and a judge of good licker needin ' a chaser . I did n't care much where I was long as I could git a good drink of licker now and again and there was a purty gal or two close  --  but Jud was right down onhappy because we was n't at the University of Vuhginia . We were restless too : after all had n't we been heroes in Pickett 's Charge  --  and was n't Greek pretty tame after the High Water Mark of the Confederacy ? And maybe we did n't amount to so much just comin ' to Chapel Hill . Oh , we 'd been to the wah , but there was plenty among the other scholahs who 'd been there too . I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot off at Antietam . And Old Bull Pettibone , who tried to teach us Greek , had eight minnie balls in him that he got as a lieutenant colonel in Jeb Stuart 's cavalreh . He was n't really old ; he just looked that way . I reckon he had a right to . One of those minnie balls was in his throat  --  or mebbe just the hole from one  --  but it made him so he could n't talk plain . I did n't listen to him much , so I cai n't construe a single word of Greek now . But I wish I had . By Gand , I neveh saw a man who loved anything like Ole Bull Pettibone loved the Greek language . But the onleh thing in Gand 's world I remember about my Greek studies is Old Bull standing behind the desk in his shabby silkfaced frockcoat on a hot day with the sweat shiny on his face sayin ' : As a wule onwy whimmive verbs have hecon aorwes . And I can repeat the first four letters of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conjunctions he used to tell too , but how it went , I cai n't recall . Ole Bull Pettibone . Evehbody made out like Ole Bull spoke plain as day even when he was n't around . For he was a great hero . They used to tell how he charged into a rigiment of Yanks at Fleetwood , hollerin ' a battlecry in Greek , killed six and took ten prisoner . And as I said , he was n't old either . He was in his thirties  --  but he looked old . He had a black , grayshot beard , dead-lookin ' ; and his hair was gray at the temples . He looked tired in the eyes  --  and there were timesp262he was grouchy as hell . His face had a passel of lines in it . But what really makes me remember Ole Bull was Jud 's trouble with him . Bull was a Vuhginian and had gone to the University of Vuhginia and then to Heidelberg , I think . Lucius Battle used to sweah he had sabah cuts on his forehead . Lucius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gits his sideface to the winder and you can see ' em stickin ' out . But I looked and looked and neveh could quite see ' em . He had the reputation of bein ' one of the best swohdsmen in Lee 's army . They say he licked the West Point champion easy , before the wah . It was before the wah too that he married with a Chahlottesville gal whose father was an ambassador or suchlike . Bull taught Greek a year at Vuhginia  --  and they would have given him his job back there . But  --  though we never saw it  --  the fact that he could n't talk plain got him down . That was the reason he came to North Carolina . He had n't been known there like he was  --  and anyway all Vuhginians thought it was a little bitty ole backwoods school . Mebbe it was . Anyway , the story went around that Bull had offered to release his wife  --  make her free to git a divorce or somethin ' , but that she had refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapel Hill with him . She was part of Judson 's trouble . She was a belle of about twenty-three . Went to school in Paris . Raised in Europe . You kin see how she 'd commence to git boahed in a Nawth Cahlina college aftah the wah . Most of the professahs were oldah men ; and their wives were purty plain beside Miz Bull Pettibone . She may have been the reason Ole Bull started askin ' his studentsto tea and suppah . Anyway Jud and me went . I saw Jud look at her that first time . Jesus Gand , Uncle Pink said , rubbing his earegg , remember arclights  --  how the fiah use ' to jump between little black sticks ? Well , that was the way it jumped out of Jud 's eyes and lit on Nancy Pettibone . I neveh realized till years later . And you could n't exactly say all the fiah was from Jud either . Histah Hudson Heahinon of Haswell , Bull was sayin ' to his wife . She had her head about her , that gal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How do you do , Mistah Judson Harrington  --  anothah of my husband'sfledgling Greeks , I take it ? He mizht 've written our names out ' forehand , but I doubt it . Ip263think she just figgahed ' em out from what he called us . Gand ! She looked crisp as an apple in the mawnin ' dew  --  but delicate and tender . Jud kept the arclight eyes on her too much  --  even that first time . And hell , I could n't blame him . She had dark blue eyes and white purty skin and hair black as the yaws that followed Brother Paul in my dream . She gave us ham and homemade wine and some kind of cookies . Said it was handtack wah fare , but not to mind  --  one day we 'd be havin ' champagne and pheasant . Well , Uncle Pink said , I 've yet to have ' em . Ole Bull talked very little . He let his wife do the honahs . You could see how he would with that impediment  --  and besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly open at all sorter got him . And all of us sat around like the young yahoos we were gapin ' at his wife and listening to that Vuhginian and European talk of hers . Good thing there were n't many of us  --  only about six in the class  --  or we'da driven Bull crazy . Nobody actually mentioned the wah , though there were three or four others besides Jud and Ole Bull and myse'f who 'd been in it ; but some way another we got on the subject of Vuhginians and Gen'l Stuart . Jud mentioned Reese Eliot . Why Mistah Harrington , Miz Pettibone said , do you know Reese ? He fought with my rigiment at Gettysburg , Jud said before he thought . Ole Bull frowned , but Jud did n't see him at all . But he 's from Mississippi , Miz Pettibone said . I know him well , do n't you , Joseph ? Es , Ole Bull said , Hoctor Eliot 's son . I haught him hum Hreek . I hid'nt ho oo wuh acwhainted with he hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Uncle Pinckney said . ' T was always a great puzzle to me . I do n't reckon he was though  --  it was just his luck . He was a purty good-lookin ' young feller  --  and Pettibone'swife had heard him tell of Reese Eliot at Gettysburg . It was Reese who got Jud into that trouble  --  really . And Bull Pettibone 's wife : She might 've been a daughter of one of the First Families of Virginia , but being raised in Europe and having her husband all shot to pieces in the war I reckon , was the reason she acted the way she did . What I refer to was that there must have been something between her and Jud . I would n't go so fur as to say positively there was  --  but I smelled somethin ' . He used to go to Bull 's house in the afternoons when Bull was not there . One day in March  --  a raw day  --  Jud said to me : Pink , I 'm not goin ' to Greek today . You better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students to stay away . And I 'm goin ' back to Caldwell tomorrow , Jud said . I 'm through with the university . What 's the trouble , , Jud ? I said , but I already smelled it . We 'll take a ride , he said . We left Old South about noon and rode out to a patch of timber and set down behind some trees and wrapped up together in a blanket . Jud gave me a pull at the jug and said : It 's Bull Pettibone . He called me out . What ? I said . A duel , he said . When ? I said . It 's oveh  --  done with , he said . Early this morning . Oveh Miz P ? I said . I reckon , Jud said . I coulda killed him . He was so angreh his pistol went off before he aimed it . He stood thcah waitin ' for my shot . Well , Harrington , he said , hiah ! And I shot into the ground . He told me he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a membah of the Army of Northern Virginia  --  andthat if the hairtrigger on his pistol had n't played him false , I 'd be as dead as I deserved . I reckon that 's what he said  --  that 's as near as I could make it out . He said that if I did n't go away , he 'd kill me like a dawg . Who was the seconds ? I said . We did n't have any , Jud said . He said we 'd have to trust each otheh . The one who could was to clean one pistol and put it back in the case and take it to his house  --  the other pistol was to be found beside the man who accidentally shot himself . He had the choice  --  and I reckon he thought he was too good with a swohd . Then you 're goin ' home , Jud ? I cai n't stay here , Pink . I cai n't see her any more , and I cai n't go to my Greek class  --  and I neveh did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vurginia . Zeb Vance was here , I said . She gave Reese that plume and palmetto star on his hat , Jud said . Now , Lee , Uncle Pink said , taking the tumefactive cystskin between his thumb and forefinger , that was all your grandfather told me about it . Bull Pettibone died the next year ; and Nancy Pettibonep265married a Yankee senator and went to live in Baltimore . I think they closed Chapel Hill down shortly after that  --  about the same time Chicken Cruppy tried to git a hawss doctah in as Latin professor . Jud and me left Chapel Hill the next morning . We got back to Gadkin county with one of Jud 's gray suits still in purty faih shape and found that Fathah was porer than we eveh thought he could be . Jud sparked around a little while , but he stayed away from Mary Ivy Dula Fitchett and all the married women . He kept goin ' down in the holler to see Cap'n Frisbie 's mulatto daughter , until one day he and I were ridin ' past Ole Gand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Chosen yelled . We turned in and got down from our hawses . Come in and make yourselves at home , Cawdor said . We sat down on the porch and Anne brought us coffee and biscuit  --  and sourwood honey this time . A social club , Ole Cawdor said , is a fine thing for young men , providing it has the correct ideals , do n't you think so , gentlemen ? We were a little flabbergasted  --  at least I was . Jud had a wise look on his face . My young men , Ole Gand 's Chosen said , have fohmed a club of young men foah puhposes of edification and jollification . Fathah has a Church , Anne said . He preaches every Sunday . Jud sat lookin ' at Anne Cawdor , who had on what may have been the same crisp white shirtwaist and the same homespun skirt she had on the day we got the bay gelding . Ole Gand 's Chosen went on talkin ' about the debates and good times his club of young men had . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause and wish to preserve the traditions of ouah fathahs . We ah goin ' to meet Thursdayevenin ' in Pine Spruce schoolhouse . Will you gentlemen honah us by being ouah guests ? Jud took his eyes off Anne long enough to say he 'd be delighted . We 'll come , wo n't we , Pink ? The onleh reason I said I 'd go was because I wanted to see what kind of a club Ole Gand 's Chosen could git up . I did n't ketch on till Jud and me was on the road fur home . Jud told me : It 's Night Riders or Invisible Empire  --  something like that , Pink . Its the Ku Klux Klan , he said . Remember what Ole Cawdor did to Gen'ral Dula 's niggers and Cruppy ? Jud was right : it was the Klan , although we called it The Invisible Empire ro we could deny it was the Klan in cote . I wouldn't 've jined , , Uncle Pink said , if a squad of buck niggers with muskets hadn't pushed me off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I did n't like it any too well  --  I do n't think Jud did either . We use ' to ride from noon till dahk into the next county and whup a nigrah fur burnin ' a barn  --  maybe hang a nigger . One or twice we whupped a white man . And once we shot a carpetbagger . To start with it was fun in a way to dress up in the calico robes  --  we had red and white ones . But I neveh held with it much . I reckon it was because the niggers and carpetbaggers we hanneled were all from othah counties . We neveh did avenge ouah own wrongs  --  the membahsfrom othah counties did ouah jobs and we did theahs so as to avoid the law . Fathah 's barn got burnt by the Loyal Leaguers , and that did make me feel like I was right  --  but not for long . Anyway , I stayed with ' em till they disbanded . I think Jud jived just because he thought he could see Anne Cawdor more often , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had thought the world of Brothuh Sion . Jud married Anne Cawdor that same year ; and your father was born in Eighteen sixty-nine . He was born oveh a store in Long Leaf . Gand 's Chosen and our fathah had set Jud up in business . It was hard scratchin ' though  --  and Jud neveh was much of a hand in business . Evehbody got into him . He did n't see cash money from one season to the next ; and he got a shed full of homecured tobacker in trade that he could n't sell fur love ner money . That gray suit of his wore out ; and Anne made him homespun britches and jackets . He took it purty hard , Jud did . Why , if they had n't had a little cawnpatch and a few turnips beside the store and a cow and pig or two , they'd 've starved to death . Would have anyway , if it had n't been fur Anne , your Grandmother Harrington . She took care of the cawn and the critters and fed Jud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feller , , but there were two , Reese and Pettigrew , who died . Reese died at two and Pettigrew at five years . Rickets they had . They neveh et right . Licker took a-holt of Jud fur a while  --  and sometimes he left Anne and went down to see the mulatto wench . And I do n't rightly know , gut I think he went to see Mary Ivy Dula Fitchett once more , but she would n't have nothin ' to do with him.  |p267He  could n't afford to keep a hawse , but he kept one to ride around the country to Klan meetin 's . I think he got mixed up with the law . Anyway , he was in a passel of trouble . He lost the store and he and Anne and the children went to live on our farm with Fathah  --  Mother had died the year before . The old Harrington place 's not fur from , here  --  place whur your grandfather and I were born  --  and your Aunt Cornelia and your Uncle Hampton . Jud kept a'gettin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly , and he tried his hand carpenterin ' . I lived with ' em a little , but I was too busy lickerin ' to stay with ' em much . I used to he'p Anne with the cawn and the critters a little while Jud was off carpenterin ' . Once he had a long job on a gristmill and made a hundreddollars . Anne needed clothes and so did the childern , but he came home  --  clean from Charlotte  --  with a new gray suit and a new hawss  --  and half lickered up . Now do n't git the idy your grandfather was mean . He was carryin ' a turrible load of trouble . He 'd allus wanted to amount to somethin ' . He 'd allus thought he was a great hand with the women  --  and he had been The Best Dressed Man in Gadkin County . Remember that . He neveh had a chance . Why he might 've been a poet . And if he 'd got into Jeb Stuart 's cavalreh , he might have come out of the wah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neveh had right much gumption myse'f . I did n't care much whether school kept or not , as long as I had three good meals a day and licker and tobacker and a gal or two . But Jud  --  you could tell there was something in him . He got sadder and sadder . He borrowed money on the farm . He bound your father out to old John Swinton as a carpenter 's apprentice for three years . Finally there was n't hardly enough left to eat on the farm . Seems to me , Uncle Pink said , that John Swinton went to Kansas first . Your father wanted to git away from Nawth Cahlina  --  and Kansaswas still purty much the Wild West in those days . I swear , I think I was there the night Robert broached the subject . Fathah , he says to Jud , John Swinton 's in Kansas . We could go there . No , Jud said . Not that Free State . But Jud liked the idy . He was allus ready to try somethin ' new . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert lit out fur Kansas . They worked their way along and got to Abilene in about three months with about thirty cents between ' em  --  and no P268baggage . They built houses and barns . And John Swinton got Jud a job makin ' coffins in Abilene . In Eighteen eighty-three or thereabouts they sent fare for Anne , Cornelia and Hampton . The farm was sold , but it did n't bring but about five dollars apiece to them above the mortgage . I gave my share to your grandmother . God bless you , Pinckney , she said . I always knew you were a good man . Well , I reckon time the family got to Kansas , Jud and Robert had a house built in Fork City . And Robert had seen his first camera . I remember he sent me a picture of Jud and Anne in front of the house  --  painted up and neat it was . Come to think of it I never saw Brother Judson , except in a picture , after Eighteen Eighty-two . Your daddy , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and I drove out to the ole place . We were drivin ' along in the red mud when along come a barfootedyoung feller walkin ' along in the rain with a sack oveh his shoulder . What you got in that sack , boy ? yore fathah asks him . Groundhawg , the boy says . Whur you takin ' him ? Robert says . Fotchin ' him to town to sell him , the boy says . Open up the sack , and let 's see him , Robert says . Well , the boy fotched him oveh to the wagon and opened up the bag and thar was as skinny a little groundhawg as eveh I see . How much you aim to git fur him ? Robert says . ' Bout a quatah , I reckon , the boy says . Hyear , Robert says . It 's five miles to Caldwell and rainin ' . Takethis quatah and go home  --  you ai n't even got any shoes on . The boy took the quahtah , but I 'll bet he neveh went home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groundhawg . Your fathah did n't say anything for a long time  --  and then he says : I remembah the first pair of shoes eveh I had , Uncle Pink . Shucks , I said , Bob ! Boys neveh used to need shoes . Why , I nevehhad shoes to speak of even when I was in the ahmy . He didn ' answer . I could see he was thinkin ' of Nawth Cahlina when he was a bound boy to old John Swinton . Your Aunt Cornelia was always a great hand for ancestors , Uncle Pinckney said the next morning after a breakfast of ham and eggs ,  |p269|potatoes  , grits , biscuits and sourwood honey . Used to draw family trees . Used to moon around right much about her daddy bein ' The Best Dressed Man in Gadkin County . She wrote me I do n't know how many letters about the family  --  and when I told her the truth once too often , she stopped writin ' to me and began on yore Aunt Clarissa . I reckon Clarissa must 've made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of . I git a feelen , Uncle Pink said , rubbing the blueveined eggskin , that mebbe the family was n't altogether to blame fur bein ' what it was . Fathah told me long ago that when he was a boy in Vuhginia , it was in the nature of a sore disgrace to run away to Nawth Cahlina . Used to be that under the King of England nobody came hyear except people who were afraid of bein ' thrown into prison for debt , coast pirates and criminals , witches , runaway slaves , escaped indentured servants and critters who were too sickly or too Ganddamn ' lazy to make a livin ' in Vuhginia or South Cahlina . Fathah said that though these were only the beliefs of his grandfather , he still felt guilty when he came here . Even when he came  --  it must have been in the early Eighteen hundreds  --  there was a lot of people here could n't tell you the name of the county they lived in . And many of the roads could hardly be seen with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were before your grandfather came along , I do n't know  --  but you can be sure there was madness in the Cawdor family somewhere . Ole Gand 's Chosen was evidence enough of that . It 's a great blessing your grandmother was n't as religious as her fathah . There was somethin ' creepy about Ole Gand 's Chosen : he had a clammy eye . Those three nigrahs of Gen'ral Dula 's kneelin ' in the street in their new lodge uniforms . An ordinary man could n't do that sorter thing  --  to do it a man 's got to be tetched . And if they 're tetched they 're generally sick . There 's a passel of sick people in this state  --  and look at how they used to die as babies . Paul and Timothy . Paul with the Yaws . Reese and Pettigrew . We all git some affliction . Look at that behind my ear . Doctor down in Caldwell says t' other day : Pink , we ought to take a knife to that ' fore it git any wuss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an egg behind yore ear ! But I said no . I said : Doc , this yere surgery 's all right , but not fur Pinckney Harrington . If you started to cut that off , you 'd find you had to go deeper and deeper  --  and purty soon you would n't leave me any head . Besides that 's one of the reasons my wife married me . Mistah Pink , she says to me , that 's a right purty onlaid egg you got behind that ear a yourn . Now , if I 'd a-been Jud , I 'd a had it took off long ago  --  but the main thing , Lee , is to feel as good as you kin and let looks go to the devil . We had been walking uphill along a redclay path among volunteercorn , a few rhododendrons and a heavy patch of weeds , when we came to the top of a little hillock . The gravestones were sticking up through the weeds and corn , damp and thin and rusty . Here it is , Uncle Pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought it . It 's just on the edge of the old place . Paul and Timothy 's both up here ; and here 's where the preacher dropped the Edinburgh bible in the mud . Reese and Pettigrew 's here too . I do n't know why I bought it , except that I always dearly loved to think of Paul and the yaws . Paul Ezekiel , Born July 4 , 1835 , Died August 17 , 1836 . Beloved Infant son of Ezekiel and Clarissa Harrington . Timothy Wayne , Born January 5 , 1825 , Died June 3 , 1835 , Beloved son of Ezekiel and Clarissa Harrington . And all the other graves : of Reese and Pettigrew and my great grandparents and Saul and Joshua and some slaves  --  Daniel 's was n't there , nor my grandfather 's which was back in Kansas . There were two plain stones off to one side . Niggers , I think , Uncle Piak said ,  --  old nigrahs father brought from Vuhginia with him , Charles , mebbe and Caesar . I do n't remember ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there may be nobody hyear on this hill . People I bought it from used to work this land  --  they may have moved the stones around . Daniel and me buried Fathah . Daniel said the prayers . He was right quare too , Daniel . Went off somewhere a long time and never came back  --  until he came back a preacher . Tall rawboned feller who never looked as if he understood a thing that was said to him . Had a sad look in his eye . He was a chaplain in the Fifty-eighth Nawth Cahlina . They say he killed more Yanks than anybody in the battle of Chickamauga  --  and spent all night prayin ' in the rain fur ' em . But Daniel and I were never right friendly . He used to come up to me and say : Brothuh , do n't you feel the spirit movin ' ? and whale me on the back hard when I was a little boy  --  so I was allus skeered of him . He used to go preachin ' to camp meetin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of brats all through the hills hyear . Him and some sister would git to talkin ' in The Tongues and ' fore they knewP271it , they 'd gone and done the business . Seems he was allus able to convince ' em it was Gand 's will . He 'd kneel down with ' em and say that they were married in the sight of Gand . He 'd tell their fathahs he felt the spirit of Solomon in him . Oh , he believed it . You never saw a feller thought he was more sanctified than Daniel . He was bit by a cottonmouth once , and he knelt down and prayed  --  and his leg neveh even swelled up . But I never liked him . You just could n't git to know Daniel . He was too close to Gand . We did n't say anything as we walked down off the hillock burial ground . And the next morning I got into the wagon and drove back to Caldwell past the grayboards of the old mill which my father had photographed with the little old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the boy with the groundhog in the sack , but I did n't see a soul on the muddy road . PAPA gave them one of the spring wagons and one of the horses ; and Ma put two chairs in the wagon for them to sit on . Beckham had a pony he had traded from the Osage who had tried to buy her from Papa . Mamma and Hetty had made her a new black silk , travelling dress as a surprise and got her a new chip hat in Independence and trimmed it up . It sat down almost over one eye and beat the New York and Paris millinery all hollow . She herself helped Ma and Hetty cook the chickens and cake for the lunch and remembered to put in four wings for Beckham . Beckham stayed that night at the house ; and they got up early the next morning  --  before the sun . And everybody had breakfast with them . Papa gave Beckham a hundred dollars for them and slipped her twenty-five dollars for herself and shook hands with Beckham and kissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mind her responsibility . And Ream said : Well , My , maybe that Osage will quit hangin ' around the farm now . Ring barked and frisked around the horses and made them nervous as Beckham drove them out of the yard past the pecan tree  --  and you could tell he was just real sorry to see her go . When they passed the Lombardy poplars and the silverleaf maples and the quince bushes she almost burst out into tears . And she looked back at the house and the kitchen that used to be all there was of the house when Papa had first brought them to Kansas  --  and , my , oh my ! She just could n't believe it was the same place . Why , it was larger now than it was when Mr. Beckham came  --  only four years ago . And there were the young orchard trees that Papa had set out that would be bearing soon . And Ring was a grown up dog and not a puppy any more  --  and would soon be an old dog . General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter and mentioned their friendship of two wars . And Papa had given them one hundred and twenty-five dollars all for themownselves . She was n't just sure she ought to have taken her twenty-five , because Papa did n't have any too much  --  grasshoppers and drought and everything . And the postmastership did n't pay anything to speak of . And even if he was still judge , he almost lost money on that . All them old settlers came to Papa to be married , because he never charged them a red cent to do it , if they did n't offer him something . A lot of them were just old trash and not decent  --  like that old fellah and that woman who 'd been living together for years and decided to be married on account of taxes or pensions or something . And then there was that fellah who told Papa he 'd send him a load of potatoes if the marriage turned out all right and if he had any potatoes . Papa just smiled . Papa was too good  --  just too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those old trash that still lived in soddies and oneroomshacks and some of them were here before they came from Io way . Beckham sat up straight in the chair  --  and they drove along in the gray morning light , the chairs jolting in the wagon . They stopped at noon under a maple tree . The sun was out then and they ate their lunch and Beckham said , smiling at the chicken wings : Myra , honey , you just bet you know the bossest piece of chicken . And she said : Do n't get it on your whiskers , Beckham . It was late in the afternoon when they got to Independence , but Judge Roamer married them and asked Myra about Judge Hanks . And Marshal Ernie Stewart and his wife were their witnesses and stood up with them . And Beckham said : By Jesus Christ , Mr. Stewart ,  |p273I  have n't seen you since that fellow Slipperly  --  Sipperly , Myra said . Sipperly , Beckham said , got out of Captain Hanks 's woodshed . You can just bet that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe , by God , a bounty-jumping skedaddler ! Mr. Stewart said maybe it was a good thing he got away because somebody might have strung him up . And a good thing  --  a Goddamnedgood thing if they had , Beckham said . Now , now , Beckham ! Myra said . Do n't you swear ! Excuse me , Myra , honey , Beckham said . Mr. and Mrs. Stewart tied an old shoe to the wagon and threw some rice on them . They had the rest of their lunch , that Ma and Myra had put up , sitting in the wagon . Then they went to the Ross House  --  and when Beckham registered , he almost wrote her down , Miss Hanks . They undressed for bed in the dark and Myra could see the moon over the prairie outside and she got to thinking of Papa and Knoxville , Ioway , and the money he had sent her from the war in Mississippi to buy a ribbon for her bonnet and Mrs. Washburn 's Seminary in Knoxvilleand how Pa said Mrs. Washburn 's son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a mandolin string but he was n't a bad boy and about that poor Harold Bates that they all called Sleepy and the tears began to roll down her cheeks . And she thought of the Indian looking at her hairbraids and Beckham hitting that old Sipperly . And then of Papa again and how good he was to give them one hundred and twenty-five dollars when he had had to pay sich things as that old ten thousand dollar note of General Clint Belton 's he had signed . And even when General Grant made General Belton Secretary of War he had n't paid Papa a cent . But Papa had n't said a thing except : Well , I see General Grant 's made Clint Belton Secretary of War . And Papa was getting older too ; his beard was all shot with gray all through it . She sobbed out loud and put her nose into the pillow . Why , Myra , honey , Beckham said , what 's the matter ? She did n't say anything  --  and when Beckham put his hand on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't move , and finally she broke into sobs again and said : Oh , Beckham , I was thinking about Papa . Then she put her face in Beckham 's beard ; and her tears ran down into it .   There , there , honey , Beckham said . You 'll be seeing the Captain a whole lot  --  you just bet you will . Why , he 's a grand man ! Sedan ai n't so far from Elgin . After a while Beckham 's silky whiskers against her cheek made her feel better , but she could n't really put Papa out of her mind . ROME saddled up Lavinia , patting her and not talking to her , but thinking that he was now twice a grandfather . He felt in his inside coat pocket to see if the twenty-five dollars for the granddaughter , Nora , was there . Of late he had discovered sad changes in himself : He could no longer concentrate when he read Suetonius and Livy and the new book by Mr. Darwin  --  with an English imprint  --  which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and believed that every man ought to read what Mr. Darwin wrote . His mind would go back to Kentucky , and he would puzzle about what Pa did when he was a young man in Virginia  --  and what he was that year at William and Mary College . More and more Rome was looking backward and inward : Why had Pa called him Romulus Lycurgus ? It was not Ma 's doing : she had n't had the names in her family , nor the learning in her head . It must have been out of Livy . He still had Pa 's old Livy , and he knew the legend of the founding of Rome well enough : The twin boys by Mars out of Rhea Silvia , Numitor 's daughter , thrown with their mother into the overflowing Tiber , washed up in their cradle at the foot of the Palatine Hill . Their mother dead , they were suckled by a she-wolf . The saddleleather squeaked as Rome pulled himself laboriously up . The she-wolf . Well , he said to his mind : I have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never found a Palatine Hill , nor built a Rome , nor had a twin brother . But little Ream died like a Roman at Shiloh . My twin , born five years late and died in my arms ( when I was turning the furrow for the wall ) at Shiloh . And Beauregardretreated to Corinth just as Celer rushed to Etruria . Yet where is my city ? Not even a ruin , for it was never built . Two wars gone and wanderings longer than AEneas ' . A creak in my bones , Ma and Pa andP275little Ream dead in Kentucky and Tennessee , Lucius hunted like a beast , and Granville dead because he is lost . He rode down the lane past the Lombardy poplars , the quince bushes and the silver-leaf maples . They looked dry and hot already in the early prairie morning . Barking , Ring had followed him a little piece past the pecan tree  --  and Lorna had waved from the door . Rome waved back and felt again in his inside pocket for the money . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it had n't been for Clint Belton , he would have enough to provide properly for his children and grandchildren . General Clinton Belton  --  Mr. Secretary of War now and never a word from him . The years in Knoxville and the years in the South with the regiment ran through Rome 's head without order : Clint coming into the office of the stable in Iowa : Rome , I need your name for a month or two , I 'm pressed . Of course , Clint . How much is it for ? Only ten thousand , Rome . Ten thousand took the stable and all the horses and what was in the bank . Clint had never said a word or written a line . At Pittsburg Landing he had told Clint how to talk to Grant . And all the reports Rome had written for the regiment  --  though it was not his duty  --  and never once had Clint added any mention of him . Rome , knew he had done his duty well  --  and that he might have been colonel of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the methods of a wardheeler . Of course , Clint ; how much ? Only ten thousand , Rome . And those Shawnees lying dead beside Pa : He remembered that morning well , a deep , green morning with the sap stirring and every sprig of green moist with life . Pa lusty for work with his axe and Little Ream chirruping and Loosh and Granny taking things in their long stride and laughing with their blood running free in their veins . The Kansas morning was not like the Kentucky morning . Kentucky was deep in the South and closer to the warmth of the world , yet it was not so burning and violent as Kansas  --  nor ever so cold and bleak . And California  --  oh , there was everything there , all right : mountains , sea , deserts , orchards , vineyards and warmth every day at midday and no stifling heat at night . Yet it was empty  --  blank as the blue sky over it on a fair day . As blank as I , who am marked and tagged now as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , even a survival . Only ten thousand , Rome . Fifty-four . My stomach worse  --  bad since the winter of sixtytwo . My bowels  --  no bowels since Andersonville . One finger , two toes  --  scurvy . Deaf on the left . My joints stiffer since last winter . What 's that tree down the road , a cottonwood ? Do n't remember it . And I could see the buttons on those Rebel uniforms across the Big Black River that fourth of July in 1863 . A little lizard ran up on a rock by the roadside , and , for an instant , as the little reptile sat frozen in the sun , Rome thought of Mexico and Grant near him in the chaparral and the gray green lizards and the copper sun . Grant gave me the Postmastership of Elgin that night at Pittsburg Landing in the cabin door . He had been drinking ; he was on crutches . And I said : Who , in God 's name , was in command ? God was in command , and Grant was God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gen'l Grant . At Shiloh he did n't do anything and Beauregard went back to Corinth . He almost went home when Halleck came . I heard many of the men say that if you 'd hit Rawlins on the head you 'd knock Grant 's brains out . But it was not so . You 'd have had to hit God on the head to knock Grant 's brains out . Grant was just there in the landscape with the army and he would say yes or no and it would go down in a trickle to a man who would say forward or load , to a company which had never seen Grant and did n't much like what they had heard of him . And so Grant rode on with a cigar in his mouth and the look of old Zach Taylor on him , not even realizing what was going on  --  never knowing what that great hunk of human life in shoddy blue around him meant . He was almost nothing but a little stoopshouldered bystander with the protective coloring of blue and stars and an ignorance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose him to survive , because he did not know what he was doing and does not know now what he is doing . All those years after Mexico : Cashiered from the army for drink , a dirt farmer in Missouri , a house agent downattheheels and then the Hero of Appomattox over the **25;301;TOOLONG , whose ignorancewas n't bottomless enough for God 's favor  --  who , most regrettably for himself , had an inkling of what he was doing and had so little protectivecoloring that he became a ghost before he died . On the road and the pastureland ahead , Rome saw the water  --   --  mirage of the July sun  --  and the few cooplike buildings of Sedan . A little crossroads named for a Prussian victory . He urged Vinny into a trot . P277Good morning , Captain Hanks ! Tom Beckham said , his beard stirring in the hot breeze . You just go right in and see Myra and the baby . The baby 's been a-watching for Grandpa Hanks since early morning . You just bet she has  --  and Harry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and do n't you ever forget it ! How 's Myra ? Rome asked . Just boss , just boss ! She 'll be up and around in no time at all . You go on in , Captain . I 'll take care of Vinny . Myra and the baby were in bed . The baby lay , in long , hot skirts , close to her mother . Rome could see her hair was going to be light  --  like his mother 's . The baby looked up at him and chirped like Little Ream and grinned delightedly . Well , Papa ! Myra said . She knows you already ! Rome picked up the child , Nora , and held her in his arms . She chirped and cooed and seemed to laugh ; she took hold of his beard with both small hands . She 's a little like my mother down in Kentucky , Rome said , his eyes far away . And she 's like Little Ream . You never knew your grandmother , did you , Myra ? No , Papa . Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Myra ! He had heard himself say it with amazement . Of course she had n't known her grandmother . He was getting old . He was nearing his dotage . A very Polonius . Only fifty-four and his mind closing the past up like a telescope  --  scrambling it up like an egg . Myra , he said quickly , pulling the envelope from the inside pocket of his dusty , broadcloth Prince Albert coat , here 's something for my granddaughter . It 's not as much as Harry had , but it 's the best I can do now . Oh , Papa ! Myra said . Thank you , Papa ! You 're so good , Papa . The baby pulled at Rome 's beard again . MAYBE Burrus was back in the Territory trying to settle up his accountsat the Fort Sofa trading-post , Wagnal said . Maybe Clint thought the West would heal him . Summer , Eighteen Seventy-six !   Why he took that trip out there in the middle of the summer , I do n't know . Why a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so threateningor commanding now , would get aboard one of those chattering , dustchoked , bumpy little cars in a heavy broadcloth frockcoat and a top hat  --  a car in which the railroadmen still halfsardonically , halfin-earnestleft up the signs saying : Please Do Not Shoot Buffalo from the Windows  --  why he started for those sucked-dry , grasshopperstripped , dust-whipped , burnt-brown steppes where every whitleathertanned , crease-necked old party who owned a section or two was trying to sell it and get the hell back to the greenfields of Somewhere where there was water and life and un-dry women and Ticker and no Goddamnedflats and hillsides full of dry buffalo grass to catch fire and burn him out nor any gullywashing thunderstorms to wash through the soddy roof and dirty all his traps  --  why Clint started for the Great West , I do n't know . He was n't hankering to be a pioneer any more . He 'd had enough of that nonsense in Ioway and the army . But he did get on that train . Oh yes ; I know he did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The general had become more accustomed to traveling in that way during his extensive campaigns in the Western Theatre of the War of the Rebellion . He got on the train : There were engines with those funnelshaped stacks on them  --  all named : the General Thisorthat , the General Soandso . And there were screenwire fireguards at the top of the stacks to keep the sparks from setting the prairie on fire , for they were all like Roman candles  --  and cowcatchers . And  --  oh , Jesus , boy , as forlornlittle brown and yellow stations  --  with the Great World dripping slowly into them through the mechanical drip-drop , drop-drip of the lonely telegraphic keys  --  as you ever saw . And at some stations along the way  --  maybe at two or three  --  where the General Thisorthat chuffed petulantly up to the watertank , the telegrapher would walk out on the gravel  --  or maybe it was still just pulverized dirt  --  with his eyeshade still on and his arms black with sleeve protectors to his elbows , and say : Excuse me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got the advantage of you , I bet ! Well , sir , I was in the Hundred and Seventeenth Ioway or I was in General Crocker 's brigade , but I seen you many 's the time . I said to myself , if that ai n't General Belton , I 'll eat my hat  --  an ' I jist made free to come out andP279ask to shake your hand . Damn ' few of us got to shake the hand of the Hero of Atlanta and the Sekertarry a War . And Clint , remembering that this was the way that votes were got  --  not remembering , or not having resigned himself to the proposition that he could not use any more votes  --  would say , putting out his Washington , Dee Cee , hand to the G.A.R. yokel : You have n't got the advantage of me at all , sir ! Maybe I ca n't call your name , but I 'd remember that face a thousand years . We soldiers  --  and you ought to know it  --  do n't forget . Later the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belton come up to me on the platform , an ' I said : I got the advantage of you , I bet , Gen'ral ! Advantage , hell ! says the Gen'ral . Do you know my name ? You 're Gen'ral Belton of the loway brigade , ai n't you ? I says . Why Goddamn ' it Doesmith , he says , afore I was Gen'ral Belton , I was major of the Hundred and Seventeenth loway Volunteers Infantry when you was a private in the rear rank a Company K standin ' next to Doakjones ! You got the advantage ! An ' then he slapped me on the back an ' says : How 's the wife an ' kids ? Fine'n dandy , I says . Well , Gen'ral , the joke 's on me  --  it 's shore on me ! An ' then I ask him about them pensions , an ' he says : I 'll make a note of it , Doesmith , an ' see to it personallythat yourn 's mentioned in the right quarter . Some of those yokels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden horses and the ropes around their wrists and ankles in the Georgia sun  --  and some of them said , remembering only with the great heart and dewy eye : Ho , Crime ! How in the hell 's the wooden cavalry ? How 's the Goddamn ' Crimean Horse ? Where 's Drumbutt ? Thus , his drawers sticking sweatily at the crotch , his collar wilting under the damp broadcloth , his eyelids gritty over the fading eye of Mars , every black Stetson old soldier hat seen from the dirty coach windows reminding him of the days of his dead glory , Clint thundered across the North American continent toward the frontier at the breathlessspeed of thirty miles an hour . He may have had it in his mind to ask the jackleg lawyer-trader , Burrus , the quick-and-easy-money man , the Indiana sutler , who will no doubt be , maybe is a sutler in heaven , flapping about on scrofulous , secondhand wings , trying to sell goldfilled wingtips , brummagem harpstringsand slightly used fine dress swords of only one-third spentP280greekfire to the heavenly host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been any records of that cotton he confiscated for Theron 's blockaders to Liverpool . Perhaps he went with the purpose to do what he tried to do fixed in his mind . His journey was over a week old when he took the stage to Sedan . Perhaps he got there at midday on a day when the Kansas sirocco was still and the thick gray dust lay powdered and printed in the streets  --  there were two or three about a block long  --  with horse-shoe and bootheel , square American toes and the long beaded scars of tobaccojuice with grains of dust on top of the turnedover bubbles . The two or three streets  --  the whole town , for that was all there was of it  --  was naked to the hot , blinding furnace of the sun which looked like the open door of a steelfurnace . The settlers had set out rows of sapling elms and maples , and built little wooden enclosures a foot square around their skinny trunks to keep the wagon hubs from scarring them and the horses from gnawing away the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely men and little boys and the backs of stray and itching buffalo . The biggest of these trees then were only a little above the groundfloor windows of the houses . And so there was no shade , no bosky dell , no relief from the thick drysoup of heat that glittered upwards toward the sun , making mirages of dry water on the deserts of dust . There was a sparse litter of limestone rocks on the main street  --  not macadam , not any attempt at paving  --  just what the plow and spade and drag had turned up . Behind the thin fringes of rickety saplings sat the painted frame-siding houses and stores , not a green branch topping their wooden horizon  --  nothing but the twisted iron lightning-rods , bulged with porcelain balls in the middle , overreaching the brick chimneys . Oh yes . Sedan would burgeon into a metropolis of the plains : the rails would come ; the trees would grow ; and elegant new houses would soon be a-building . Now , there were a place called The Farmer 's Home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an empty wooden chickencoop made of saplings and a light spring wagon for produce ; a livery-stable , white-fronted with gaping doors for the two or three carriages and , above these , a door for hay , open , with creaking pulley tackle above it at rest , so that the threefoothigh T and A in stable were concealed ; an implement house , P281where plows , harrows and even those new-fangled reapers of old man McCormick 's could be ordered , or , luck being with you , bought from the floors ; a dry goods house with yards of turkey red and figured calico , flannel and little silk , a tacky hat or two , some Butterick patterns and a Singer sewing machine ; a store with whiskey in kegs , tobacco and flour , acetic acid vinegar and bacon ; a photograph gallery . And there was the Beckham House , Wagnal said , your grandfather'shotel . It had about a dozen rooms , two chimneys , and two or three saplings on the corner side of it . Built in the simplest logcabin style of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the front with six fairly fancy posts holding up the flat roof . There were four windows in the front  --  two on either side of the door which opened onto the top of the porch  --  and above the windows , arching upward toward the apex of the roofpitch , was BECKHAM HOUSE , painted in great , red block letters . I can hear my grandfather now , Lee thought : I do n't want any Goddamn ' fine print , so 's a man 'll have to strain his eyes to see it 's a hotel and whose hotel it is . I want the sons of bitches slapped on there five foot high  --  or more  --  and Goddamn ' good and red . And because , in the **38;328;TOOLONG style of building , the front is smaller than the sides , my grandfather said to the painter : Now over there 's four windows too , but we got some room over here  --  you make ' em six foot high over here . Sandwich ' em in between the windowsand leave off the HOUSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But make ' em in red . As one of the city fathers , he hung the corner street-lamp to the corner post of the front porch . When the letters were on the hotel , he walked through the thick dust of the street to the Farmer 's Home , limping slightly from the minnie ball he got at Gaines 's Mill , about faced and looked at the hostelry : By the gods , they could see that all right  --  even at night , if there was moon enough to help out that streetlamp . The Beckham House in Sedan , Kansas . Summer , Eighteen Seventysix . Why , boy , Wagnal said to me , you can not imagine how dry my very bones feel now as I think of that time and place . Oh , there were rag rugs on the floor and clean sheets and quilts on the beds  --  your grandmother would always see to that , even if she were dying . There were n't any bedbugs and the meals were fine , from lush cherry and apple pie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've no doubtP282that it was the cleanest , most comfortable , most sumptuous hotel on the frontier . But down near there the soil begins to redden and all man-meat becomes jerked alive in the summer time and frozen for the winter . In those days it was a bleak land of hopeful saplings  --  a land waiting industriously for shade and moisture . Why , down the street from your grandfather 's hotel , two or three doors in the only block , there was a photographer , one Keland . He had a set of stereoscopic views of New York City and Washington , D. C. and Paris . People used to drop in and sit near the cool , damp door of his darkroom and look at his iron headclamp and those stereoscopic views under the little north skylight . By God , they would say , they sure got streets back there . They sure got some buildings , ai n't they ? God , look at them paintings in that Loover ! Well , it ai n't agonna be long till we have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already got a photograph gallery . You can git your picture took here . The west sure draws men to it . But they never believed that the saplings would grow ( though some of them did ) , that the town would ever be anything but a place to pause over night , a place to buy a barrel of flour or a sewing machine  --  aplace to grow lonelier than you were in the farmhouse where your land lay all around you . A place to look at a hunk of limestone in the street at noon and think of the tall trees in Ohio , the dark green of Pennsylvania and the Great World outside this sea of dryland where you were marooned in the brazen sun . Well , Wagnal said , Clint and Crime put up at the Beckham House and wrote their names on the register . Tom stood in the mirage on the dust and took one of the grips from the stage . Whew ! Clint said . Reminds me of hay foot ! straw foot ! in the army . Is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just bet , Tom said . Clint signed the register , maybe with John Clinton and Crime 's name  --  Mibble or Gribble or whatever it was . Tom brought him a tub and three buckets of hot water into one of the downstairs rooms , where Myra 's lace curtains hung down straight before the open window and you smelled the hot dust and a faint sharp horsedung and urine smell from the stable down the street , though there was no wind . There you are , Tom said . Not too hot , not too cold . Thank you , sir , Clint said . A man called R. L. Hanks  --  he lives around hereabouts ? Captain Hanks ? Tom said . Why , he 's my wife 's father . He lives down near Elgin  --  about thirteen miles from here . DoP283you know Captain Hanks ? Ah yes , Clint said . I knew him in the Army of Tennessee during the war  --  a friend of mine . Well , sir , by God , Tom said , putting out his hand , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's is a friend of mine . My name 's Tom Beckham . How do you do , Mr. Beckham , Clint said , shaking the vote-giving hand . Yes , sir , Tom said . You wo n't find a finer man in the whole world than Captain Hanks  --  not if you was to be hung fer it . Yes , Clint said , I know . He is a fine man . Do n't you fergit it , Tom said . He ought to a-been a Gen'ral . ( Tom still pronounced been bean as his father had . ) Him in the Mexican war too  --  but he did n't get his just dues . He was in an Ioway rigiment  --  I do n't recollect what one . Why , Torn said , there was a whole Goddamn ' kit and boodle of young puppies permoted over his head . That Belting fellah  --  that Secretarry a War . Ah yes , Clint said , there was a good deal of injustice done . What outfit were you with , Mr. Beckham ? Why , Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's first hundred thousand  --  Zouayves they was . Corp'al , F Company . I would of been a first lieutenant  --  I was promised a commission in another rigiment , but the son of a bitch went back on his word ! Ah , Clint said . Army of the Potomac , eh ? Yes siree , Tom said . Wounded at Gaines 's Mill and sent to Bell 's Island . Myra gave Clint and Crime some dinner . Mamma , Tom said , I want to make you acquainted with Mr. Clinton . He knew your Papa in the war . How d'ye do , Mr. Clinton , Myra said . It seems to me your face is familiar . Was you ever in Knoxville , Ioway ? No , ma'am , Clint said . It must be these whiskers of mine  --  all of us men look more or less like beavers . Oh , now ! Myra said . Beckham tells me you 're a-going to see Pa  --  Mr. Hanks . Yes , Clint said , I 'm driving over this afternoon . My ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later  --  you 'll get sunstroke . I told Beck  --  Mr. Beckham jist this morning I never seen sich a summer in all my born days ! Now , Mamma , Tom said , Mr. Clinton knows what he 's a-doing . He 's an old soldier . Well , I do n't care , it 's jist awful hot . Was you in Pa  --  Mr. Hanks 's regiment ? Clint said : I was in the same brigade part of the time . Well , Myra said , he 'll be tickled to death to see you . We do n't get to see many old friends out here in Kansas . Myra looked sharply at Clint and the Eye of Mars neither threatened nor commanded  --  it looked away . Old Rome Hanks 's daughter , eh ? Well , she was still a pretty enough woman , though she looked tired . She had black hair almost as beautiful as Una 's . And married to this Beckham  --  and living in this Godforsaken desert , running this hotel . Hotel indeed ! One jump from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asked Mr. Cassel to give Clint and Crime good horses . Maybe he actually stood and pointed the way over the little rise : Take that road and you 'll come to a row of Lombardy poplars and some silverleaf maples . You ca n't miss it . And tell the captain , hello , for me ! Tom would n't even take anything for the room and meals : From a friend of Captain Hanks  --  hell no ! Oh , they found it all right , even though it was dark and the lantern was feeble . Crime drew the horses to the side of the road near the quince bushes . They stomped a little in the hot dust and switched their tails and tried to chew at the branches . A bit of water for the animals , sir ? Crime said . No , Clint said . Not now . Just wait here until I come out . We 'll hunt a stream then . Yes , Sir . Clint could see the yellow windowlight on the rise and he walked toward it trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass . He walked up on the porch and saw the light and shadow move on the walls of the hallway and the shine of the dark walnut newel post on the end of the baluster . He smelled the coal-oil and milk smell of the farmhouse and saw the little bugs on the screendoor and heard the bootsqueak coming behind the highheld , flickering lamp . MOTHS sat on the screen outside ; the little bugs got through . They circled and wheeled around the smoky lampchimney , which Lorna had polished that morning , and fell , dying , or maimed , on the open pages in the yellow light under Rome 's eyes . A cicada or two burred dozily in the orchard and a stifling August sirocco , which had risen before nightfall , dried the earth , fetched the dust through the screens and dried the sweat in Rome 's graying beard . At times the wind , sluggish and slight tonight , was still : and the window frames did not rattle : then a black veil of nightheat enveloped the orchard and the well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been within the field of Rome 's vision had it been moonlight or daylight.  |p285Darkness  and quiet , Rome thought . Dark as Andersonville , but quieter . The groans and the raiders : memory . The lamplight falling on the pages of the book , the small pool of light around him in the room off the parlor , the tick of the small graygreen insects hitting the lampchimneyor the pages of the book , the tiny wingwhirrs , the cicadas , the creak of the sideboards of the house , the soft warm swish of the few leaves that the grasshoppers had left on the trees only thickened the dark and quiet , so that Rome saw all the earth as lying simultaneously in darkness and silence , from the icelocked polar seas to the thick orchidaceous and sinister tropical jungles , places which he had never seen except on the lantern slides of his brain , but which he still wished to see , not with the fire of a young and lusty man who sits upon a dock and smells the sea and the rope and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Liverpool or Shanghai or Lisbon at nightfall , but with the desire of one who knows the decks and rope and bows are not for him  --  and his only ship is this four walled cage  --  this house , this home earth around him . Say I had been to Africa , Asia , the Americas and Europe and all the major archipelagos and lived with all the peoples of the earth  --  reached out with the antennae of my senses and made notes on this " knowing " of mine . It is not exactly the vain desire to leave a monument , but say I had written a book and taken it , strongly bound , wellprintedon good paper , with my name  --  my ghost  --  on the title page , in my hand , I could have felt the heft of the good , tightpressed pages of the folio , the quarto , the octavo  --  even duodecimo  --  volume and said : Well , herein is what I have concluded , though the observation may be faulty and fuddled , though my meaning is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words  --  there are no words  --  with which to transfer it to other minds . Now I no longer have anything more to say , except simple statements predicated by the verb to be and modified by simple adjectivessymbolizing such as color or density . Rome , turning his head from the dark window , looked down at the page on which lay the small body of one of the graygreen insects , one of its wings wrenched out of its folding-place under the shield which protected their transparent film . Dishevelled , laid low , the bug stared at the sub-head on the page : " The Term Struggle for Existence , Used in a Large Sense . " " I should premise , " Rome read and Mr. Darwin had written  --  Rome knew  --  before the battle of Shiloh , " that I use this term in aP286large and metaphorical sense , including dependence of one being on another , and including ( which is more important ) not only the life of the individual , but success in leaving progeny . Two canine animals , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each other which shall get food and live . But a plant on the edge of a desert is said to struggle for life against the drought , though more properly it should be said to be dependent on the moisture . A plant which annually producesa thousand seeds , of which only one of an average comes to maturity , may be more truly said to struggle with the plants of the same kind and other kinds which already clothe the ground . The mistletoe is dependent on the apple and a few other trees , but can only in a far-fetched sense be said to struggle with these trees , for , if too many of these parasites grow on the same tree it languishes and dies . But several seedling mistletoes , growing close together on the same branch , may more truly be said to struggle with each other . As the mistletoe is disseminated by birds , its existence depends on them ; and it may metaphorically be said to struggle with other fruit-bearing plants , in tempting the birds to devour and thus disseminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into each other , I use for convenience ' sake the general  --  " Flipping the dying insect from the page , Rome turned to the end of the book : " It is interesting to contemplate , " wrote Mr. Darwin perhaps beside a warm fire in a clean well-lighted room , " a tangled bank , clothed with many plants of many kinds , with birds singing on the bushes , with various insects flitting about , and with worms crawling through the damp earth , and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms , so different from each other , and dependent upon each other in so complex a manner , have all been produced by the laws acting around us . These laws , taken in the largest sense , being Growth with reproduction ; inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction ; Variability from the indirect and direct action of the conditions of life , and from use and disuse : a Ratio of Increase so high as to lead to a Struggle for Life , and as a consequence to Natural Selection , entailing Divergence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , from the war of nature , from famine and death , the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving , namely , the production of the higher animals , directly follows . There is grandeur in this view of life with its several powers , having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one ; andP287that while this planet has gone circling on according to the fixed law of gravity , from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and wonderful have been evolved . " Perhaps , Rome thought , the implications  --  moral , philosophical and religious , to say nothing of the uncatalogued biological , zoological , anthropological , and other scientific details  --  may have awed Mr. Darwinas he wrote beside the fire . Perhaps he was appalled by the fathomlessnessof what lay beneath his own words on the one hand and invited and charmed on the other by the same quality , which would draw him into more rapt examinations of the wings , gills , vertebrae , vestigial parts of the elaborately constructed forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enchanting ignis fatuus which a man must pursue through the swamps of ignorance , if his life is to be anything more than a sluggish nightmare with never a waking moment . What a storehouse of varicolored wings , what a waving company front of fronded antennae and palpi , what neat rings in that arachnid ! Rome wished that instead of tramping from one part of the great North American Continent to another , instead of having followed a vague desire for something , of the name of which , of the shape and color of which he knew positively nothing at all , he had been able to direct his faculties , as Mr. Darwin had done , toward scratching the surface , toward some work of penetration or discovery which would remain to astonish himself with wonder to the end of his days  --  and perhaps survive many years after his death to fill the eyes of all who could interpret its symbols with a light of wonder and lead them on toward the secret of life and the truth about all things . But Mr. Darwin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewed such a segment of the process of Natural Selection ( indirect , it is true , Rome footnoted his thought ) as occurred on the banks of the TennesseeRiver , April sixth and seventh , Eighteen Hundred and Sixtytwo , among the higher animals . Shiloh : The Civil War , which was to Rome ribbons of muddy river and a long , hot , muddy , dry , devastated strip of the South , filled with whiskers and malaria-tinted eyes in ranks , ending in scurvy behind a wooden stockade in a Georgia bog , was also Pittsburg Landing on the Tennessee river , the morning , day and night of April 6 , 1862 : a day of individual men seeking to survive in a concentrated destruction . But he could not long keep his mind on this quasi-scientific viewP288he had been led to take of Shiloh , for Shiloh had brought up the inwardsight of Little Ream dying in his arms , of all the bloody men lying pierced , broken and buffeted in the mud , of the horses he killed , of the man in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battery of Napoleons , and all the violence which had brought no benefit to anybody concerned ( and many not concerned )  --  except the doubtful benefits of obliteration to tired spirits , the problematical partial re-fertilization of a few Tennessee cornfields and the salubrious results of open air exercise upon the bodies of those soldiers who came through the battle whole , the last perhaps being , in most cases , cancelledby the effects that so savage and heartless a metaphorical struggle for existence as Shiloh must have had upon minds mostly young and of very small compass at the time and without much experience of the methods and instruments of the higher animals recorded upon them , effects which must have been several , including : the planting of fear , suspicion , disgust , bravado , cruelty , cunning and thousands of variationsof these adjuncts to existence . For Rome 's own part , he had come to Shiloh  --  still one of the bloodiest battles of the bloodsoaked earth  --  with what he believed to be a mature opinion of war and its necessities . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Landing . True , he had seen the Captain 's jaw knocked off by the roundshot and the homeless tongue wagging in the air ; and he remembered the men , with their coats open in the manner of scurvy Old Zack , shooting down Mexicans who were unarmed and not even soldiers  --  and that without even so much as taking the cheap seegars from their mouths . It had been a cruel and dirty war , but all of it had nothing in it like the impact with which the battle of Shiloh struck him . Now , in the August night , his little pool of light around him , with the graygreen insects ticking against the lampchimney and the open pages of his Darwin , he could see the wildwhirl of the Army of Tennessee ( perhaps because Grant had inherited a fondness for liquor ) on that damp April morning : Frightened men running everywhere , camps , sibley tents , wagons , mules ( the dead one that was not freshly dead lying flycovered and stinking near a card-scattered wooden pavilion , against which leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , sutlers , wagons , twisted men , tinware strewn in company streets , flags rippling out torpidly in the breeze . But now , fourteen years after , the dense details of this battlefieldp289had melted into and become tightly entangled with the subsequent skirmishes , actions , movements and battles in which he had been engaged : Corinth , the investment of Vicksburg , an unnamed skirmish ( with the aid of the Tenth Ohio Battery ) at Messenger 's Ferry on the Big Black river , the battle of Atlanta . Thirty-nine when he arrived at Pittsburg Landing , his mind was no longer a fresh tablet , for the recording of the images , pressures , tastes , sounds , smells that it had been when he had known Grant in Mexico . Yet even then , because of the early violence which he had known , such as the killing of his father by the Shawnees , the killing of Bull Tone and unnumbered fights with men , the elements and nature incarnated in such as rattlesnakes , buffalo , Canidae of various kinds , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun to be impaired . That is , he could not , for instance , be sure that the sequence of his mental images representedthe sequence in which he had taken their impressors to him . Now , by a sort of mental trickery , he could be almost sure that the muddy smokebound street , a minelike passage of sooty warehouse buildings through which he had marched with his regiment on a chill dark day , was near the flinty cobblestone levee in St. Louis in place and before the battle of Shiloh in time , inasmuch as he could recall no other city through which he had marched with his regiment while it was still , so to speak , a virgin regiment with no penetration of its ranks by minie balls , shot or shell . He could not remember any other day in his military life which had so depressed him with the damp chill weather , the mixture of soft coal smoke and fog in the stagnant air , the total indifference , the almost-contempt of the St. Louisans whom the regiment passed ( on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and who waved not one handkerchief , gave voice to not one weak cheer , nor , indeed , even turned their heads ( with the exception of a few heavy , perhaps German-brewer faces , seen for a moment through streaked windowpanes ) aside to see the Iowa soldiers march to the river to embark on the steamboat voyage which was to take them to General U.S. ( Unconditional Surrender ) Grant 's Army of Tennessee , which was to take them  --  and this , many years after , filled Rome with queer and obscure wonder about the ways in which men go toward their dooms and the relations of chance and doom  --  and almost literally set them down in one of the most terrible battles of the earth . Besides these fixed points of memory , labeled : March 28 , 1862 ,  | embarked St. Louis ; April 6 , 1862 , arrived Pittsburg Landing , Rome could embellish memory with fading ocular , auditory , olfactory , tactual and lingual impressions . He could elaborate the trip on the Mississippi and Tennessee rivers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insipid riverwater , and the sweatsmell of a thousand nonetoo-cleanmen  --  the smell of a mob or a beast . Aside from these few mental records which he was able to place in a proper , if loose , sequence along with some of their trappings , he was unable to arrange the notes which his mind had taken except in a way which he considered unreliable . Sitting in the pool of light , the graygreen bugs catching in his graying beard , assailing his ears with their small foreboding and annoying whirr , his eyes glazed with the effort of remembering , and his thoughts fugitive and fast  --  a circumstancewhich worried him  --  turned to the act of remembering itself : He considered how a muddyboerted foot brought up and placed on a gray , cracked wagontongue , or a grease-ringed wheelhub could call up the vision of his brother Lucius stopping a wagon on a Kentuckyroad to pass the time of day with the driver . He could see Loosh , easy and graceful , as he set the stock of his rifle on the ground and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Well , Eph , or Newt , or Jim , how air you ? and hear the man answer : Tol'ble , or peart , or that he had the misery in his back or an ague . He considered how the sight of his brighteyed grandchild , Nora , lying in her crib and her chirpings as she lay there could bring up the walking , moving pictures of Little Ream  --  not as he had seen him alive for the last time at Shiloh in the loghouse hospital on the landing , nor as he had seen him cold and stiff with a crust of dried blood around his lips the next day , before he and Wagnal laid him in the too-shallow and now totally unmarked and forever lost grave  --  but as he had been in Kentucky as a boy , hoppingalong beside Rome asking questions and taking the answers as infallible just because they came from the lips of the brother he worshipped . The dead Remus Hanks , the sixfoot piece of stiff meat and bone with the eyes open in an idiotic stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Hundred and Seventeenth Iowa Volunteers , had saved for him , Romulus Lycurgus Hanks , the grieving brother , he sometimes remembered when he saw a wet shallow hole in the ground , or a bayonet above a mantelpiece or in a lumberroom , or a tincup  --  for he and Thomas Wagnal had dug his brother'sp291grave with a bayonet and tincup ; or , again , he remembered that dead Ream of Shiloh when he encountered the sweetsick smell of unburied dead flesh : some settler , leaving his claim near Elgin , had killed a broken-legged horse and left it lying in a field ; or a suspected horsethief had been hanged and left to hang in the sun ; or fresh bodies had been placed in the trees of the Indian burial places . Then Rome 's olfactory nerve would send the overpowering sweetodor message to his brain and again he would be in the muddy camp , days after the battle , when the spring sun and air had begun the decomposition of the shallowburiedand unburied dead , wondering if the rain had washed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a few days after the burial , he was beginning to think of as the childbody which had trotted beside him ) , as it had from the bodies of many soldiers  --  for Rome had seen arms protruding from the earth , arms protruding from puddles like travesties on the legend of arm which took the sword of Arthur , whole bodies with gas-inflated bellies sighing as the gas broke away as if the men were in some strange extra throe of death . And then he saw himselfover and over again squatting under an oak jabbing the ground with a bayonet , throwing the earth aside with a tincup  --  working fast , for , though he was not sentimental about the useless inanimate body , he could not bear the thought of what was once Little Ream being trampled by a mob of wild campers-out with guns  --  in 1862 , still very little more than a mob of heedless boys on a lark , led by ambitious , snide , cunning , cruel , drunken , brave , obsessed , arrogant , opportunist men . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he believed , have robbed little Ream of his youth in Kentucky , of the dignity he had had as a child  --  and , indeed , oh indeed , Rome said to himself , he was my brother . For that matter Lucius and Granville were his brothers too , but between them and him there had been nothing but the common feeling between men who know the look of the hide , the superficial habits , opinions and methods of each other and hence know , within certain limits , how each will react to certain stimuli . Between him and Ream the understanding and sympathy had been deeper : While each was unique , not as every man is unique , at least in the whorls of his fingertips  --  apoor distinction which is the only one that penology gives joyfullyto those wretches who come within its corrective clutch  --  but as men who do not go about the petty businesses of life only to keep , if possible , their pulses beating tranquilly and their little affairs going onP292from day to day in the groove that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a blank blue sky  --  as men who consider too curiouslyfor the Horatio in all their kind . So he had had in Little Ream one who was twice a brother , one born of the same mother and infected with the same wish to look beyond the blank blue sky for something which would dazzle and confound those who were nothing more than pulsebeats in quickmeat . Yet Rome wished that Ream had not conceived such a worship for him that it had led the boy to Shiloh and his death . The thought of Ream joining a Union regiment in Kentucky , because he had heard that his brother , his god and his mentor , was a Union man , warmed Rome 's heart , but it also reminded him that he had led little Ream into folly and brought him to a fruitless death in a dingy loghouse on the banks of the Tennessee river where whole men were being subtracted into cripples because they had heard a band play or a judge or a senator shouting about a glorious cause from a rostrum or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materialize , words which had never meant anything at all to men like Ream and him , Rome , but that they had been duped again by the ambitious who had stood to gain by rattling the sword but never girding it on . I killed my brother . There in the corner by his bookcase he saw , as his eyes lost their remembering-glaze and fixed on the objects in his own time and space , his sword , scabbarded in scratched and tarnished brass , its pommel surmounted with an eagle , its hilt covered with sharkskin , its blade signed , P. D. Moll , Solingen . He had carried it in two wars : In 1846 he had cut a Mexican in the neck with it  --  at Shiloh he had beat the frightened driver away from the horse . Outside of these actions , it had come out of its scabbard only for drills , parades , and to cut the air . Now it would come out no more at all . He laid down the Darwin on the table beside the smoky , bugstained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He pulled hard , the blade gritted and came , as if reluctantlyfrom the scabbard . On the " Moll " there was a dark , rusty stain , which his son , Ream , when very young , had insisted eagerly was blood . Rome had said that it could not be . And when the boy looked disappointedand disillusioned , he was sorry both because of the boy 's disappointment and because of the eagerness of youth to revel in and enact in imagination all bloody strife . Why , Rome thought , are strife and bloodshed things which man is born to love ? Why ? Could there notP293have been some other way to puff and strut ? Maybe if women were not watchingA somewhere-known footstep was coming toward the house . Rome picked up the bugstained lamp and walked toward the door , the sword still in his hand , forgotten . CLINT saw the face , Wagnal said , and the beard  --  the eyes straining from the sockethollows into the dark behind the mill scrollwork of the screendoor . The little bugs were jumping around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long way since Georgia . Good evening , sir , Rome 's voice said slowly . Come in . Then maybe he saw the door was hooked and absentmindedly lifted the hook out of the screweye with the sword . Clint looked curiously at the sword and stepped inside the lightcircle in the hall . He 's ready all right  --  he knew I was coming . The beard 's irongray and dead , the shoulders are down  --  and he 's thin as a racer . Good evening , Clint said . Good evening , Rome . Why , Rome said , it 's Clint  --  Clint Belton . I was reading . Come in and sit down  --  I must have picked up this old toadsticker  --  Rome shook his head to ward off the little bugs from the thickhot nightair around his beard and ears . Good evening , Clint said again . I was out this way on a trip  --  and I thought I 'd drop in on you . Yes , Clint , Rome said . I 'm glad to see you . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the browngrass . Sit down , Clint , Rome said . I was just thinking of the day we marched through St. Louis to the levee  --  the day we started for Pittsburg Landing . Ah , yes , Clint said . The Landing . He looked down . It has n't been so long , Rome said . Fourteen years , but it seems like a century . I was thinking of Wagnal  --  and  --  Shuball York and that Bates boy . Ah , Clint said . And that boy who pulled his teeth . Well , Clint said , I 've come to stop your thinking too hard , Hanks . You think you 're going to hold that one minute over me the rest of your life as you 've done for the last fourteen years . He had the revolver out  --  maybe it was still the same one he had shot the Louisiana Grays ' lieutenant and Bates with  --  and cocked . What one minute ? Rome said . You know , under the bluff . I lost my nerve for a minute  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but you were n't caught at it . You knew that , Hanks , and held it over me all down the years . If it had n't been for you , I would have been a brigadier before Atlanta . If you had n't written those letters to Stanton , I 'd have been a major-general  --  maybe a lieutenant general before the war ended . Maybe , I 'd have been president . What letters to Stanton ? Rome said . I never wrote any letters to Stanton . You 're mistaken , Clint . Look here , Hanks , Belton said , I was a lenient officer during the war  --  and I expected some intrigue in the army , especially as it was a volunteer army . For a long time I did n't believe it of you  --  I believed you were one of my loyal company officers . But not long ago , I began to see . You and Wagnal and Bates were as thick as thieves  --  and you and that toothless simpleton deserted at Atlanta . Now , Clint , Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it  --  the boy has n't shown up yet . He died in the prison pen at Andersonville . You say he did , Belton said . I say he could n't die . Why , I shot at him at point blank range at fifteen feet and he did n't die . Your hand trembled , Rome said . I saw it . Oh , you did , eh ? Belton said . Then why did you trust a murderer with ten thousand dollars ? Well , Rome said , I was not sure until now that you were shooting at the boy . I was not ready to believe it of you  --  perhaps I was not ready to believe such a thing of man . Maybe you were shooting at him because you thought he was giving ground . Oh , hell , Hanks , you talk like Old Simpson or a woman from the Sanitary Commission . Perhaps , Rome said , I did believe it then , but I did not want to believe it . You began shooting at Bates before Corinth . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the works at Atlanta . I know that now . Wagnal and I would not believe him then  --  and after Corinth he changed his mind . He would not believe that as brave a man as you  --  he saw you riding up and down the line drawing fire  --  would kill his own soldiers . Well , Clint said , he found out what I 'd do . Maybe , Rome said . He could n't see behind him . Do n't accuse me of cowardice , Hanks ! I was n't , Rome said . I said only that he could n't see behind him . And you trusted me with ten thousand dollars  --  I always thought you were a hayseed and a fool , Hanks ! What 's wrong with you  --  had a call to preach Christ in the woods ? You believe this business of turning the other cheek ? Well , you wo n't be able to turn either . cheek when I get through with you . Telling me I 'm a coward !

I think you do not know what you are doing you have lost your touch . I 'll show you who 's lost his touch . I should have shot you first and not bickered with you . I do n't care to hear you praise your own virtue . You are not shrewd any more , Clint , or you could have seen that I was far from praising my own virtue . I have not even learned how to deal with your suspicion  --  let alone your ambition and cruelty . I have not even learned to deal with what I find in my own mind . I do not know what virtue is . Well , Clint said , you 'll find out damned soon what it 's reward is . Waiting for me with a sword ! How did you know I was coming ? You 're a great sneak , Hanks . No , Rome said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . You wo n't shoot me , Clint . You are still too selfish . Why should you ? The bluff , young Bates 's death at Atlanta  --  it 's fourteen years now , and who would believe it ? You might be elected president on the strength of the persecution . What would I gain ? And the debt  --  you know I could n't make you pay up . Why should you shoot me ? It 's not frugal . You think I 'm a coward , do n't you ? Clint said . I do n't know what the word means , Rome said . Maybe it means bad bowels , or ignorance , or great learning . Why should I think you a coward when a thought can make me quail for days ? Why should I think you a coward when I am so cowed by the vision of loneliness and boredom that I quiver all over my carcass when I lie beside my wife at night ? What if she should die ? What if all my children should go away ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Or what if I had had my head blown open and lived for hours like that Rebel boy at Shiloh ? What , indeed , would I have done , if it had been my back and not my brother Remus 's that was broken in 1862 ? What , above all , would I do if I did not wake from the dreams I have of lying again in the stockade at Andersonville ? No , Clint , I do not know what cowardice is . Why did I go with the regiment to Shiloh and Atlanta ? Why did I follow you at the risk of my life ? Was it because I believed that I must preserve the Union and free the black slaves ? Was it because I was a brave man who believed in the Right ? No , I had my eye on the main chance  --  oh , not so much as you  --  but I wanted the distinction and the spoils which come to a conquering hero just as you did . No , I was not humanity 's hero  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am afraid to think of what has happened since the Hero of Appomat/tox got into the White House . If this constitutes cowardice , then I am a coward . When I read Mr. Darwin 's book , I thought we were getting better than the beast of prey  --  that everything was somehow arranged . Maybe Clint went out while Rome was talking , Wagnal said , with the gun still in his hand hanging down loose at the side of his frockcoat . He walked through the meatbaking heat with the hotbreeze drying the coldsweat on his forehead trying to think what to do , where to go , who to shoot , why he had come to Kansas , why he had ever been born and gone to Harvard and come out to Ioway . He was trying to understand what Rome had said to him and to think why he had n't shot Rome . He was thinking over everything from Shiloh to Atlanta : each shot he had fired , each scratch he had got , each awed look he had collected from the yokels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Lumpkin over the breastworks . He thought it all through and came to the telegraphers who came out of the stations to shake his hand . Well , he said to himself , they still think I 'm all right  --  they still know me . Crime was waiting , holding up the lantern , and for a moment , Clint saw him as he had been at Corinth that night : Not quite young , bucktoothed and stringy and servile  --  and slick as you please . Been doin ' a bit of fowlin ' , sir ? Bit dark , ai n't it , sir ? By the by , sir , you wished me to charge the men a certain amount for transporting their cabinets , sir ? And , I think , sir , you said something about a slight remuneration for mine and the boy 's services , sir ? And thank you for the brandy , sir . Oh , I think we understand each other , sir . Clint halfraised the pistol and then put it in his pocket . Oh Crime saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say anything  --  he just laughed softly . They got in the buggy and Clint felt tears rolling down his . cheeks  --  but they were n't human tears . Go ahead Sergeant Fell , Clint said . That was his name , Fell  --  Herbert Gribble Fell . Up the close and down the stair , But and ben with Burke and Hare . Burke 's the butcher , Hare 's the thief , Knox the boy that buys the beef . That 's it , Wagnal said . It was an old song . P297ROME would awaken again feeling the spent ball numb his knee at Corinth , or feeling the Raiders ' clubs on him in the prison pen at Andersonville . Lorna would stir in her sleep , a coyote on the prairie would howl and Rome would turn over thinking  --  in the bleak Kansas night  --  of Clint Belton , wearing new buck gauntlets , riding up and down the line of battle on the cavalry hack in Mississippi , shouting at the men and drawing the fire of the crazy Texans . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Bluff or Atlanta when Clint had said : You , Hanks , form your company here ! Rome knew now . You , Hanks . No Captain , no Mister , no Rome  --  and spoken in the voice a planter might have used to a Negro . And in the presence of the Iowa boys who had respected Rome for years . You , Hanks . Then Clint had smiled through his beard and lent his eyes an arrogant commanding look ; and the light had caught the bright new colonel 's birds perched on his shoulders . Shuball York had looked at Rome for a moment with wide blue eyes . What 'd he say , Mr. Hanks ? What 'd Colonel Belton say ? Nothing , Shuball . Nothing of a personal nature  --  just a military command . Just a military command . Yes , yes . Discipline well-maintained helps toward promotion . But , you , Hanks ! was not a military command . And from Clint Belton : If I had not fed him in my house  --  if I had not watched him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , you , Rome . Those words were spoken in sixtythree or four , but Rome rememberedthem as clearly as he remembered Loosh 's boot-toe on a cracked gray wagontongue , and Loosh saying : Californy , eh , Rome ? As clearly as he remembered a thousands scraps of talk and scenes . You , Hanks . He had been reassured the night Clint came into his tent and offered him and Wagnal the brandy bottle : I tell you , Rome , I get lonesome for our days in Iowa . How long have we been down in this Godforsakenmiasmal country ? Well , Rome , and you Thomas ( to Wagnal ) we 'll build a metropolis in the west . And I 've written to Washington about that majority of yours  --  and yours , Thomas . He got to be Brigadier-General Clinton Belton at Atlanta . The Rebel colonel died of shame . And now Rome knew that it was not a slip of the tongue . It was , you , Hanks , that he meant . Hanks spokenP298cold and hard was the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've come to stop your thinking too hard , Hanks . Shuball York had been sending him the Burlington papers for a long time  --  and now and again he got the New York World himself . Clint Belton was hardly ever in them now , but Rome remembered when he had married the elder Theron girl  --  it was before Thomas Wagnal had married the young one . The Burlington papers then were full of stories about Mrs. Clinton Belton 's fifty pairs of shoes ( or was it forty ? ) , her Parisian ball gowns and negligees , her jewels and her coral parasolhandles . Worth , the Paris dressmaker , said the New York World , had fasted for seven days over her trousseau . When the one with the piece about Clint 's wife selling post-tradershipscame , Rome was sorry for Clint . Clint had set such store by show . And the Southern Belle : Rome knew what Una Theron ( was it Una ? ) would be like : pretty , arrogant and heedless , incapable of affection for anything but power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not as good as a Roman ' courtesan . Only ten thousand , Rome . He had hidden the papers from Lorna and the children  --  on a ledge in the corncrib . ( He wondered why he had ever saved them at all . ) No use to hear them speak bitterly about the note that had turned their home into a prairie : That old General Clint Belton ! If it was n't for him we'da never had to leave loway ! If I have my way , Beckham , you 'll never go on anybody 's old note . Now , Myra , honey  --  he 's from Philadeify . Rome had heard enough . He coughed ; and his daughter looked up . Oh , Papa ! Myra said with an ashamed look on her face . There , there , Myra , he said . When Shuball York had come stumping along on the wooden leg he had bought cheap in St. Louis , Rome was sitting in the office of the livery stable reading Volney 's Ruins , feeling as if it were just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do anything else . He had felt that way ever since , after Andersonville , he had got up from his sick bed and gone back to work  --  morning , noon and evening . Well , Shuball ? Rome said . Mr. Hanks ! Shuball said . Then he blurted irrelevantly : Shire Newtonfinally got it . Four years  --  and then a strayshot at Bentonville . He shifted his wooden leg apologetically , hoping Mr. Hanks would say nothing about it . P299Poor Shire , Rome said . I remember him at Pittsburg Landing with the flag . He was a fine boy . Mr. Hanks  --  Shuball paused nervously . Yes , Shuball . You know , if it had n't been for your company bein ' infantry , I 'd a been in the calvary . You know I 'm good with bossesYes , Shuball , Rome said . And I 've lost a hostler  --  Worsham Jones left me . We old soldiers should stick together . Rome put out his hand . Shuball took it . He could n't say anything at all  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll expect you tomorrow , Shuball . But Shuball had not worked for him long  --  and yesterday Rome had got word from Ioway that he was dead . Now Rome had begun more and more to see the wide continent of North America spread out before his mind 's eye in one great nocturnal panorama . It was empty of towns , except for a few such as the little ones of Knoxville , Iowa and Corinth , Mississippi . He saw it at night on the trail to California when the wagontrain had been corralled . He saw himself in a buckskin shirt , lying under a single blanket in a great waste place , feeling the wide band of his moneybelt on his belly underneath his clothes . He saw the continent all around him  --  and the wagontrain on the night that the loutish boy from Missouri had crept toward him with the English steel handaxe he had taken from the Indian he killed and scalped . Rome remembered how the Indian 's axe had crunched into Davis 's skull before the boy , Bull Tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised the axe over him , but Rome knew he was about to raise it , and he picked up the Walker six which lay cocked beside him and fired as the axe began to twitch . The flash was a pretty orange flame in the night  --  and for an instant , Rome saw the sandy soil and a bloody splash on Bull 's face . Joe Chiles was standing over them with his musket and a lantern . Joe saw the axe lying beside Bull 's hand  --  and what was left of Bull 's head . Calcallated to blame it on the injuns , heh ? Joe said . Well , Hanks , I reckin it 's fer the best . Bull had a natcherly acquisitive disposition . Yes , sir , said a voice in the dark . And he was gittin ' too Goddamn ' handy with that Hudson Bay Tommyhawk . Rome Hanks done right  --  nothin ' more'n shootin ' a rattler . P300Bull was the first man he had killed since the Shawnees who goes Pa . He remembered getting up from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others buried Bull some distance from the corral . He lay awake for a long time thinking about life and death and justice , and he was sorry he had shot Tone  --  sorry that he had not given him the moneybelt , sorry even that he had not lain still and taken the axe in his skull . For , he thought , not that it was a terrible thing to have taken a human life , but that by killing even such dangerous and destructive fellows as Bull Tone , he had helped set a money value on life . And the setting had been maybe a lowering . There had been a hundred and fifty dollars in gold in the belt . God knows , life was cheap enough . Rome felt insignificant and cold and unloved and hunted when he thought that his life was worth no more than a hundred and fifty dollars . He was tasting the milk of his foster-mother , the she-wolf , from whose dugs he was never weaned . When he first read The Origin of Species in Knoxville , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the man he had killed  --  and of how he had survived the Shawnees and Bull Tone 's axe and Santa Anna 's cannon . One early spring night with the wind whistling and howling around the house , when he lay thinking of these things and of the bullets at Shiloh and Little Ream and Brother Loosh drawing a bead on him with his own gun , he knew that he had tempted death too long . He would die soon , not even having survived to the end of his life  --  with no one even to bother to set down his parting words . He thought of General Lee and Stonewall Jackson dying , both crying for Hill to come up ,  --  though Lee had died in his bed long after the Army of Northern Virginia was scattered over the world . In a moment he was homesick for the Armies of Mexico and Tennessee , for the foolish heart remembers or forgets best . And Rome , in his house at the edge of the Kansas prairie , with his family around him , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pa , said Ream 's voice from the dark doorway . Them lambs in the pasture in this snowYes , Ream , Rome said . I 'm coming . You go along out to the barn and saddle up . I 'll be right out . Those lambs of course . Two days old . He swung his legs painfully to the floor , thinking of all his bivouacs on the earth  --  and how , now , P30Ieven the warm bed did not rest him . He dressed feeling the rheum gather in his eyes . In the kitchen he lighted the lantern ; he saw the powdery flakes whirl and eddy in the edge of the dark . He saw Ream 's light in the barn and a faint powder of snow already piling up on the branches of the pecan tree . Ring yipped a little . The fold was not far . Two lambs were dead , but they brought four to the kitchen across their saddle pommels . Lorna and Hettie made beds for the half-frozen beasts beside the stove and gave them warm milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed his teeth were chattering . The next morning he had a fever . Lorna gave him brandy and quinine and put a mustard plaster on his breast . But he asked her to take it off . Please let me be comfortable , Lorna , he said . But Mr. HanksI 'll be all right , Mamma , he said . Lorna did not like his tone . She called Ream into the kitchen : Saddle up and ride to Independence and bring Dr. Vogel back tonight  --  tonight , Ream . Do you hear me ? Tell him your mother is worried about Mr. Hanks . Tell him that he knows I 'd never bring him on a wild goose chase . Now hurry ! Why , Ma , Ream said , he ai n't that bad , is he ? A doctor ? Now , never you mind , Ream , she said . Just do as I tell you . At one o'clock the next morning , Lorna saw the doctor 's buggy lamps coming up the road by the snow weighted silverleaf maples and Lombardy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put more wood in the fire . He came in with heavy powdery snow on his shoulders and beard and eyebrows . Veil , Mrs. Henks , Ream says dere iss someding amiss vit die Judge ? He went out last night in the snow after these lambs . He 's got a fever now and he has n't spoken right for several hours . Such liddle fellows , the doctor said , looking at the lambs . Bitte , led us look at the Judge . P302You AWAKE , Lee thought , in the vast night of all the years . You awake somewhere in the vast night : Everything is around you , all time forwards and backwards and all space . At night , in your bed , you see everything that has been or will be . And you awake at some place where you have never been , nor ever will be : You awake at Gaines 's Mill , lying in the hot , blood-reddened swampweeds with Tom Beckham , or you awake with Robert Lee Harrington , carpenter 's bound boy , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make coffins in Abilene , or you awake with Romulus Lycurgus Hanks and General Ulysses S. Grant as they stand in the rain on the night of April 6 , 1862 at Pittsburg Landing , Tennessee . Or you awake lying on your own deathbed in a body you do not know . And you cry out : How could I have known ? I tell you , I did n't know ! All right ! All right , Goddamn it ! I 'll go back and look again and heed and look again and heedYou awake at the corner on Mississippi street in Lawrence where you took your mother 's slap to your bull 's head , or with Sister Therese when your mother was dying as a little child , or standing in the street with Dee Given and Breezy Gortz and the three-speed bicycle , or out in Riverside , California , with Grandma Hanks in the under . ground passage in the Glenwood Mission Inn in 1910 . You wake less loved and more bewildered . An ambulance and a police car sirened in the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapped on the bedlamp blinking as if he were batting his eyes a time or two . He lit a cigarette and lay frowning , speaking aloud in the cold damp air : What demon drove me here ? I might have stayed at home and pushed the Century camera around the pinefloor under the good north skylight ; and photographed cavalrymen on papier mache chairs and babies and middleclass oldwives and farmers ' family groups and gooching wedding parties  --  and golden wedding aniversaries . The celluloid collars , the necks like stovewood , the inflexible poker backs and the great brown hands  --  the leathernecked soilstupid women staringinto the big Woolensak Optical Company portrait lens . Bat yer eyes a timer two . Now you folks just look natural . Watch the little birdie . But I would go where I have gone again , for there was noP303place for me there . Now I know there is no place for me anywhere . And he thought tenderly of his tin sword rusted away in the ordure of the privy ; and Grandpa Beckham coming home with HairbreadthHarry under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Desdemona face haloed around with incredible snowflakes ; and Mamma combing her hair for a long time ; and the twists of tobacco they were going to take with them on the trip ; and the taste of the waffle Uncle Joe bought for him in the dusk of the Manayunk evening when he made the man blow his trumpet  --  and how Papa must have bent his poor shoulders over the coffins in Abilene ; and of the girl who used to come to his rooms from Iffley village  --  and she came once when the Isis was frozen over for the first time in thirty years and God , how young and warm she was in bed with him . Her father was a major in the Indian army ; and she wore fur mittens on a string around her neck like a child . And of how Papa never went to college but had had much to bear  --  and of how not all the scalding tears in the world were enough to shed for the homesickness which comes in the night , and for which there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any place to go . Bat yer eyes a timertwo a-purpose , he heard his father saying back in the year of Nineteen and twelve perhaps  --  back under the good north skylight , standing on the plain pine floor of the operating room where the rubbertired rollers of the fine varnished welljoined Century camera stand ran . The camera which had a big lens marked Woolensak Optical Company with a black metal funnel on it for a shade . He could see the little smooth rolling wheels on the stand with its elevating gears and tilting devices in brass and the piece of heavy sawtoothed cardboard that Papa had made for a vignetting apron stuck in the frame which came with the camerastand . He could see Papa coming out of the darkroom with his slightly bent-forward walk  --  a little harried , his Sunny Jim wisp of hair on his baldhead standing upright where the blackfelt focussing-cloth , which was attached to the Century camera with a curtain rod , had pulled it up . And he could see him put the wooden plateholder in the camera and slide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was made like the slide of a rolltop desk , only much better joined and slicker . He could even hear the good sound of the wood parts of the camera as Papa  --  after turning off the little light at the little redP304cambric-blinded darkroom window  --  slid the newly loaded plateholder into the camera and rolled back the slide , revealing the yellow sensitivefilm of emulsion on the 5X7 Cramer Dry Plate , inside the dark compartment of the bellows , to wait for the impression of the Actinic rays of light on the face in front of it . Bat yer eyes a timertwo a-purpose , he heard Papa say again with the big openended rubber bulb in the hand with brownstained fingernails . Now , study ! Papa would say . Do n't look at the camery . Look just about over yonder  --  and think about somethin ' nice . Click ! he heard the shutter come open as Papa 's strong hand , with the thumb over the hole in the end of the bulb , squeezed and held . Click ! he heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took his thumb off the hole in the bulb and let his hand come loose . Now just sit still , Papa would say to his sitter . Just relax , and we 'll git another negative to make sure . Then , after Papa had said : You can see the proofs on Saturday , he would take up the plateholders impassively  --  if the sitter had not annoyed him by moving , or setting his teeth , or looking unhuman and not natural  --  and , turning on the light before the red window , would dive into the cool dark smell of the developer and acids . Or , if the sitter had annoyed him , he would shake his head slightly to one side and say : Daggone ! Ten to one I 'll have to make a resitting , and dive into the darkroom with an air of disgust for all mammals who moved or looked unhuman while being photographed . They saw some pictureshowactor looking that way , he would say . As Lee lay squinting in the night , this series of pictures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Cramer Dry Plate multi-exposed  --  passed in his mind quickly , not flat as on a screen , but deeper and sharper than life , as are the braces of photographs mounted on a card and looked at parallactically through a stereoscope . Now , in the midnight moment of a Los Angeles room , his heart strained to go back to the operating room of Nineteen and Twelve in Fork City . He wished to be as he was then , a boy hiding behind a painted background , watching his father make a picture of Mrs. Hickenlooper , the musicteacher , in a high lace collar with the diamond prize medal from Vienna at her throat , or General Joffray with goldbraid under his gold epaulettes and a long trailing cavalry moustache . He wished to be as he was then , forgetting the wretchedness of the bloody lung , the dull ogre of school , the faces of the boys he hated , and the terror of the words that MammaP305could say , and the places on the street and in the house which it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would go blind if you played with yourself . If he could go back now and know that all the rat 's litter of things which had happened would happen , would he be here in a shabby Los Angeles room , with the grime of Experience rubbed into him so that he felt dull and dirty ? The packrat , Experience , he said aloud . It drags in putrefactive corpse-fragments . The camera of experience bats its lens a timertwo . DR . VOGEL , Ma 's homeopathy doctor from Independence , called it pneumonia , but Myra never believed that he ever knew what it was . The little German wagged his head and clicked his heels and said it was pneumonia , but he did n't fool Myra at all . He did n't knowwhat Papa had . ' tShe sat by Papa 's bed for twelve whole hours without ever closing her eyes once  --  and Papa never knew her . His eyes were open a good deal too ; but he looked at her and did n't seem to know her or recognizeher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pa  --  those Shawnees ! and Hand me that rifle , Ream ! and Of course , Clint , as much as you want , and Steady there , boys , hold your fire ! and I 'm sorry , Clint , you did n't deserve such a woman ! and Sodom and Gormorrah ! and Back ! That 's the deadline ! and Buggery they call it in England ! and Are they after you , Loosh ? Where 's Granny ? Granny could ride , and Stay in front of me , Ream ! She listened to Papa saying those things , knowing that they were about the Civil war and the battle of Shiloh and General Clint Belton and Papa 's brothers and something she did n't understand about that awful old Rebel prison at Andersonville , Georgia . She was seized by an almost unendurable tenderness for Papa and Papa 's harsh hard life he had lived . She remembered how she had cried when she first saw the one-room house Papa had built here in Kansas , and she cried again for shame that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that letter she had written to Papa about the Rebels when he **31;395;TOOLONG was the favorite indoor sport of the day . Any occasion sufficed . Self-appointed committees acted for the community . Speakerswere selected , toasts apportioned and drunk ; it was a poor and meager evening when they did not run to at least a dozen . When Horace Amlie was put on the list of regular guests , it was a recognition of his status as an established Palmyrian . Two members of the powerful Canal Board having announced their intention of inspecting the local works , it was a matter of course that they should be feted at the Eagle . With them came the famous New York City physician , David Hosack . To Horace 's mind , this was a bad sign ; it meant that the commissioners were informed as to the prevalence of disease . A childbirth at Poverty 's Pinch disappointedhis expectations of attending the festivities , but he reckoned on finishing up in time to meet the noted doctor before the breaking-uphour . A worse sign for Palmyra was that both visiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of local pride and optimismover the canal they responded charily . They were not pleased with the progress of the work and made no bones of saying so with a frankness which dampened the spirit of festivity . Did the local contractors , they inquired pointedly , think that they had ten years at their disposal ? Why could they not keep their men up to schedule ? Where was their boasted public spirit ? What steps , if any , were being taken to check the fevers ? Did they not realize that contracts could be abrogated for non-performance ?  |p151By  the time half a dozen lifeless toasts had been drunk , the dreary affair was over and the diners had broken up into glum groups , who stood about discussing the problem over unofficial drinks . Such was the situation when Horace got back from his delivery . He sought out Dr. Hosack . " Amlie ? Amlie ? " repeated the famous man amiably . " I 've heard my old friend John Vought speak favorably of you . " " I owe much to Dr. Vought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . You 've had opportunity of observing the local fever , ! resume . " " More of it than I like . " " Is it the Montezuma type , think you ? " " Graver . We are having deaths . " " Bad ! Bad ! The commissioners take an unfavorable view . Abandonmentof the work , even temporary , would have a very damaging effect upon public opinion . " " It may come to that , sir . It would mean ruin to the village . " " To many villages . It would be a catastrophe , Dr. Amlie , to the prosperity and pride of our great state . In your opinion , are the miasmas hereabouts heavier than elsewhere ? " " No . Less heavy and less frequent than in the marshes . " Horace summoned up his courage . " Do you necessarily attribute the malaria to the miasmas ? " The distinguished visitor 's eyes narrowed upon his junior . " What have you in mind ? " " Fever-bearing insects . " " It may well be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betweenfilth and jail-fever . Filth can be disseminated by insects , and so disease . " " I believe that to be the case . " " Have you propounded your belief locally ? " " I have suggested it and been laughed at . " " Yes , yes , of course . I am an old man , Amlie . I have seen much and thought much and believed little except upon due proof . I have observed miasmas where there was no fever and fevers where there were no miasmas . " Have you seen fevers without flies and mosquitoes , sir ? " asked 1 brace with intent . " Not the canal fevers . Not the malaria . But "  --  he waggled a warning finger at the other  --  " not proven , my young friend , not proven . Our medical pundits will have none of it . Propose it at perilp152of your professional neck . They 'll skin you alive and hang your pelt on the fence . " " Then you advise me to hold my tongue ? " " Nothing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I only say , go slow . There is for the skeptic and questioner in our profession an odium modicum harsher than the odium theologicum of the pious . " He peered searchingly at the young man . " But you are of those who must speak as they believe . I see it in your face . Good night , my young friend , and God be with you . " As Horace thanked him , Old Bill Shea approached . " Mr. Latham wants to see you . " The magnate was seated at a small table in the parlor corner with a glass of rumbullion before him . One glance told Horace that he was in a black humor . His " Sit down , " was a direction , not an invitation . He did not even extend the courtesy of a drink as he bent upon the other what Dinty called " Mr. Latham 's money-look . " " What am I paying you for ? " he growled . Horace silently enumerated the bones and nerves of the great toe , an exercise which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the classic practice of counting ten . " To look after the health of your camp , " said he . " Do you think , by God , you 're doing it ? " Trying to provoke a quarrel , was he ? On the occasion of an earlier meeting with the autocrat , Dinty had warned him against the Latham bullying . " I 'm doing what I contracted to do , " he replied quietly . " Like hell you are ! Shea , here , tells me half the men are laid off . " " Not half , " protested the overseer . " I never said half , Mr. Latham . " " Well , plenty . Flat on their backsides with what they call fever . A passel of scrimshankers , " he declared . " They 're not scrimshanking , Mr. Latham . They 're sick men . " " Why do n't you cure ' em , then ? " " As soon as they 're cured , others will come down . " " And that 's the best you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounded the table-top until his unfinished drink slopped over . " How 's the work to get on ? Am I to sit here and watch my profits leaking away through laziness and incompetence ? " " I 've told you what ought to be done , sir , " said Horace passing that insult up . " Take it or leave it . "  | " You mean that God-damned nonsense about moving the men where the bugs ca n't bite ' em ? " " Ask Geneseo Martin whether it 's God-damned nonsense . " " He 's gettin ' two to our one of work , with half as many men , " put in Old Bill . Mr. Latham consigned Geneseo Martin to the lowest depths . " A Iahor-coddler , " he snorted . Horace took another tack . " When you pay for medicines , you take them , do n't you ? " " What if I do ? " " You 're paying me for advice , " Horace pointed out . " Wasted money . " " Wasted , indeed , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's business , Mr. Latham , " said the overseer respectfully . " Business ! What does this young sprig of science know of busi-ness ? " Foreseeing that he would some time have to face that challenge , Horace had prepared for it . He took from his breast pocket a neatly penned sheet of paper and laid it before his employer . Mr. Latham glowered . " What 's this ? " " A rough estimate of your day-to-day loss through sickness . " Figures commanded Genter Latham 's respect where humans did not . The flushed anger of his visage was replaced by cool , shrewd contemplation . After studying the columns , he tapped the paper with his finger . " Not ill-reckoned , " he conceded . " But you 've left out something . " " What ? " " The cost of moving camp . " Horace concealed his exultation . " Shea can give you that better than I. " " It wo n't cost us so much , " said the Irishman . " We 're nearin ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . When we move , we might as well pitch on high ground as low . " " Give me an estimate tomorrow , " commanded Latham . He turned to the physician . " There 'd better be no lay-offs in the new quarters , " laid he threateningly . " I make no such promise . " ' Then what the hell is this about ? " " My undertaking is that disease will be lessened  --  no more . Forp154every man restored to work "  --  he tapped the paper in his turn , loot ; ing the other straightly in the eye  --  " you save computable money and time . " Well , well , " grumbled the great man . " Have it your own way . And have a drink , both of you . " The evening was not yet done for Horace . On his way to the door , he was intercepted by Carlisle Sneed who had been allaying his re sentment for the affront to local pride by quaffing his toasts double . " Doc , me boy-hoy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How is my eye wiped ? " demanded Horace . " Wuh-hiped dry . Dry 's a bo-hone . " The humorist warbled , Wreathe the willow and the rue , My sweet love has proved untrue . " Didn'cha hear Misser Levering freighting the news around ? " " I did not , " replied Horace . " What did he say ? " " Aha ! Bow yer head , me bucko . Miss Agatha , fai-hairest flower of Palmyra 's bloo-hooming maidenhood , is betrothed in ma-harriagc to that canting son-of-a-bitch , the Rev. Exhorter-Snorter Sickel-scythe and may their first brat be born with a wooden halo . " " Amen ! " said Horace . He felt like a jail-delivered man . Lacking a definitive period of mourning for a broken heart , it was expected of the lorn swain that he should exhibit a properly melancholious mein in public until time should have healed the wound . It was no more than what was owing to the lost love ; to do less would be a reflection upon the lady 's charms . But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horace 's behavior had comported with the requirements of the case . He had gone about , clothed somberly and ( except when it slipped his mind ) with a creditable effect of woe . Now his penance was over . Of deeper concern to him than any personal considerations was the new experiment . He did not expect miracles . There were still a few cases of malaria in the Martin camp , as he knew . This troubled him . It seemed to exculpate the mosquito as agent of the disease . Well , he could only give it a fair trial and hope for patience on his employer 's part . Nobody knew better the lay of the land in the township than ' Tip Crego . Horace set the boy behind him on Fleetfoot and they made a tour of exploration . Out of several locations which seemed suitable to the physician , his companion advised a site a mile west of thep155village on one of those singular and abrupt earth-knobs , later to be known to marveling geologists as drumlins . The valley spread out sonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise this high , " said Tip . " I thought we were agreed that it is n't the mists but the mosuitoes , " objected Horace . " The black mosketeers come with the evening mists . They only V sifter dusk . Have n't you noticed that ? " I brace had not . He confirmed it by observation and set it down Mtt his notebook. ' he new buildings were rushed to rough completion in five days . Here young Crego further proved his usefulness by ridding the grubarkof what flies survived the lime treatment , by a simple expedient. door and window he hung great bunches of the tall , abounding sweet clover , the scent of which no winged insect can abide , suspend-g other festoons above the table . Within a week after the transfer , the health of the camp was owing so marked an improvement that Old Bill Shea talked of t t i ng on night squads to make up for lost time . Tip shook his head . " ' I'hey 'll get bitten and they 'll get fever , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked the overseer who had come I , , we a solid respect for the youngster 's knowledge . " I f you can make ' em use it . " Adapting the method used in the local mint-stills , Horace and his l pressed out a supply of pennyroyal extract which was supplied I lie workers at cost . At the physician 's suggestion , Genter Latham lied an order , prescribing its use . He knew that there was still some et in the camp . Horace had been quite frank in saying that he lid not explain it . The great man was not captious . It was enough him that his project was now showing better speed than any other the valley . The Irish workmen , an independent and fractious lot , were at first tical of the preventive virtues of what they regarded as a fad , anded to disregard the order . But when they discovered that theodorous oil protected them from the stinging pests better than cumbrous neck-smudges which were the standard resource , they opted the relief gratefully , all but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than half of this number de-I the shakes , to the great satisfaction of their physician whonoted it for future submission to a medical journal . He tried todata from other camps , but except at Martin 's the overseersp156were surly and uncommunicative . They were doing badly . Squire Jerrold 's project was one of the hardest hit . With the approach of the excavation to the village , local spirit rose to meet it . Early and late Latham 's diggers toiled , wielding their tools by the light of flares and fires , while the goodwives brought them coffee and the tavern keepers contributed a sturdier liquid to spike it on rainy nights . Bonuses for extra dirt-removal were increased . Rivalry drove the work forward at record speed . They crossed the boundary line of Palmyra Village at two o'clock of a fine September morning . A cannon was fired , the churchbells pealed , and the populace turned out . All the men knocked off work . Center Latham , aided by the village ladies , had prepared a mighty outdoor feast for which the fires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Gargantuan potpie . Each simmering fivepailkettle held thirteen fowls , sixteen squirrels , ten rabbits , accompanied by liberal chunks of beef , mutton , and venison , with potatoes , carrots , turnips , parsnips , onions and cabbages to fill in . For side dishes there were baked beans , stewed squash , and peas boiled with pork . In the house ovens , pumpkin pies two feet across ripened . Liquor flowed like water : whisky , rum , hollands , hard cider and a choice of brandies , peach , plum , cherry and blackberry or all of them . The robustharmonies of canal song rang through sedate streets more habituatedto the meter of the hymn book , culminating in that swift-paced chorus which was largely popular because it was supposed to represent some recondite and occult smut . Singsong , pillywinkle , snipcat , sootbag ; Singsong , Polly , woncha guy me-O ! Overnight Palmyra became canal-conscious to an almost frenetic degree . Hitherto the more respectable and conservative element had regarded Governor Clinton 's mighty venture with mingled expectancy and distrust . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a new maritime prosperity . The tempo of the whole environment was quickened . Converts hotly prophesied " Rochester to Albany in the spring . " Warehouses , put swiftly into process , began to fill up with produce and goods before the roofs were shingled . New thoroughfares were laid out and named : Chapel Street , Jackson Street , Fayette Street , and , of course , Canal Street . There was a new tannery , a new ironmongery , a whitesmith 's establishment , ground was broken for ap157stoneyard , two saloons sprouted where one had sufficed before , and there was optimistic talk of building a public library and improving the jail . Wages skyrocketed until carpenters were earning a dollar , r play . Real estate boomed . Building lots doubled and redoubled in value . Center Latham put up a building for his banking operations . People said that he would be a millionaire-man one of these fine days . ' I he community went mildly and happily mad . Exhorter Sickel coined a sour locution , Eriemania . The Scythe of Salvation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of Children 's Crusade . He laid out a schedule of visits to the young of the Presbyterian flock , to test the armor of their faith for chinks into which Satan might enter , and to artily their orthodoxy by prayer and admonition . In ministerial coursehe invited the regular pastor to participate . The Rev. Theron trang accepted as a painful Christian duty . He did not like the Sickel ays. 1E01 on the Exhorter 's list stood the name of Araminta Jerrold. his was no compliment ; far from it ; it was due to an appeal from rs . Jerrold , not participated in by the Squire , who tried vainly to persuade his better half that Dinty would do well enough if only her of her would let her be . I'he mother was not content to let the child be . She was , she told herself , responsible for this immortal soul which she had , by a process which still left her dully bewildered when she considered it , brought being . Dinty was not the only phenomenon which contributed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She found uge from the perplexities of an enigmatic world in a groveling reiosity , expressed in dreary texts and the type of hymn which proclaimsthe singer to be a poor worm of perdition . It bored her worldly Shand extremely . In this crisis , Dorcas Jerrold found the support of the Rev. Philo kel profoundly comforting . The Exhorter guaranteed to rescue uminta 's soul if it was still salvageable . On a crisp afternoon when she would have preferred to go hickory fling with Tip , Dinty reluctantly put on her white frock and went n to the parlor where the two reverend gentlemen , black-garbed n toe to neckcloth , awaited her . After the greeting , which was in form of an appropriate text , Elder Strang formally and mildly stationed her upon vital tenets of the denomination which both prod . She came through creditably on predestination , original sin , viction of depravity , and salvation by faith , and was looking for/ward to an early release , when Exhorter Sickel took charge along more personal lines . " When and where were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . When I was two years old . " " You then renounced the world and all its follies ? " " Oh , yes , sir ! " " So that , when you breathe your last , expiring breath , you can die in the hope of salvation ? " " Yes , Mr. Sickel . " " What would be your sad fate should you die , unbaptized ? " Dinty knew the answer to that one but did not like it . She temporized . " I 'd be in trouble , " she said . " You would be in hell , " snarled the Exhorter . " Yes , sir , " said Dinty without enthusiasm . He eyed her with stern suspicion . " Do you doubt it , Araminta ? Are you tainted with the deadly poison of heresy ? " " I hope not , sir , " said Dinty , troubled . You know that you are a sinner ? " " Yes , sir . " He intoned , Sinners shall lift their guilty headAnd shrink to see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , sir , " she quavered . He gave out ten minutes of concentrated exhortation and co mination and , at the end , pointed a bony finger at her . " And now , " he demanded , " are you willing to be damned for di greater glory of God ? " Dinty wriggled . " Please , sir , I 'd rather not , " she said . " Answer me ! Yes or no . " Her lip trembled . " I do n't see how it would help God . " " That is not for you to say , lost soul that you are , " thundered d Exhorter . " Yes or no ? " " No ! " said Dinty desperately . She would not cry ! Not before this nasty sourface . She hated him It was n't fair . It was cruel . If she said she was willing to be damned , Mr. Sickel would probably tell God and God might take her at het word . She turned a piteous face to Parson Strang . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A strange thing happened . The stern , gray pastor came over a  |p159his  arm around her quivering shoulders . His face was pale and pined . He said to his brother of the cloth , " Are you willing to be damned for the greater glory of God ? " " Yes , " answered Mr. Sickel with a meek and smug smile . " Then , sir , you ought to be , " returned Mr. Strang with such bit-:less as Dinty had never before heard from his mouth . " Come , Araminta , my clear . " With that gaunt , protective arm still about her , he marched her t . The sound of Mr. Sickel 's supplications followed them . He pored to be asking Heaven 's pardon for both of them in exasperated.nts . Before dark it was bruited about town that a devil of unrighteous-s had issue from Dinty Jerrold and excited Elder Strang to insultBev .

Squire Jerrold , heavy of heart and extustcdin patience , assented . Full of woe and perplexity , the child sought out her trusted friend d counselor . " Uncle Horace , do you think I 'm a damned soul ? " " No . Why should you be ? " Dinty folded her hands , the unfailing concomitant of piety on her it , and recited , Soon as we draw our infant breath , The seeds of sin grow up for death . The Law demands a perfect heart , But we 're defiled in every part. d to repeat that a hundred times yesterday . " " W hose idea was that ? " asked Horace , frowning . " Exhorter Sickel's. " brace muttered something so uncomplimentary to the Scythe of anon that Dinty gasped with horror and delight . " Oh , Uncle Horace !

" Do youe everything you ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shelf-row of infallible authorities ; cocksure claims and autocratic dicta of the discordant pundits . " Fin afraid I do n't , Dinty . " Then maybe you 're in peril of damnation , too . "  | " I 'm liable to be , before all 's said and done . " " If you ca n't believe , you ca n't , can you ! " said the little philosopher summing up the despairing problem of saint and sinner . " We 're rebels , I expect , you and I , " said Horace . " Born to trouble as the sparks fly upward . " " Is it very bad to be a rebel ? " " Perhaps it only means being born out of our time . " He w talking more to himself than to her now . " A rebel has no contemporaries . " How do you spell it ?

She thought that her Uncle Hora had forgotten her . Something awry with his office impinged vaguely upon Horace consciousness a few days later . He presently identified it as a change in the decorative scheme . To his questioning , Mrs. Harte respond . by tossing her head and avering that she did n't meddle where s wa'nt bid , but she could n't warrant as much for that smudge-eyed . imp of mischief , Wealthy Latham .

Relieved om the cramping Levering influence , he developed into a bit of a y blade . He became active in the Light Dragoons . He joined the Horsethief Society , meeting on Thursday evenings to devise ways and cans of combatting a new and lively industry with which the constitutedauthorities were impotent to cope , while consuming the contentsMine Host St. John 's social bowl . He became a fire warden with ribboned staff , sworn to discharge the duties of that honorary office hick had little to do with the devouring element directly , but were pre of a police function to correct the widely held theory that a fires a heaven-provided opportunity for the neighbors to augment their usehold equipment . A ninepin alley had been established in the cellar of Mr. Hurd 's t+w inn . Thither Dr. Amlie repaired two evenings of the week , to plsort with such gaudy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperous among the canal laborers . Going further in Iruipation , he joined the sporting element of the smithy in layingt a quarter-mile straightaway racetrack on the eastern outskirts , here weekly trotting contests were held to the accompaniment of lomcless and open wagering . Of a Saturday afternoon the rising nmg physician might be seen , fashionable in a suit of the gay Dndon Blue with white silk gloves , acting as judge or , on occasion , Unpeting on his mare , Fleetfoot . It was reputed that he had wonnty-five dollars from Ephraim Uperaft on a single heat . P164The Palmyra Society for the Suppression of Vice &; Immorality passed and published resolutions declaring that " horseracing is t Ise box of Pandora from which issue more and greater mischiefs than ever man counted or measured , " and accepted Horace 's resignation without a dissenting voice .

With his cronies of the smithy he held weekly revel in his luxurious quarters where , it was darkly whispered , they played at fipenny loo . Whatever the effect of these debaucheries upon his private repute , they did not impair his professional practice . Through that winter it steadily increased . Moreover , he was making social hay . His slightly rakehell reputation did not seriously prejudice him in the eyes of local spinsterhood . Only a few rigidly moral households such as ( naturally ) the Leverings ' , the Van Wies ' and the Deacon Dillards ' closed their doors to him . So impartially did he distribute his attentions , however , that he gained a name for baccalaureate caution . Dinty wrote him , Everybody wonders *10 whom you are going to marry and why you do nt . Do nt you think my grammar is im-proving ? Late in the winter the coach discharged a chilled but joyous Dinty whose first social call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he inquired .

" " Oh , yes . I 'm all right . " " And how do you like your detestable nunnery ' now ? " Dinty had the grace to blush . " I get along better , " she admitted . " I miss you , though , Uncle Horace . Have you missed me ? " " Why , yes , I believe I have , a little . " " Only a little ? " " Well , quite a lot , if you insist . " " That 's nice , " she purred .

It 's Captain Run sey . " Silverhorn ! " Horace stifled a startled oath . " That unprincipled rip ! How comes she to know him ? " " She does n't exactly know him . But she saw him on Main Street and he smiled at her so romantically ! Next time he passed her , driving in the country , he blew his bugle to her . So she wrote him a letter . I helped write it .

Then , a the butcher 's he met Mrs. Jerrold who purposely failed to see him , having regarded him as practically nonexistent since the destruction of her panaceas . She was talking with Mrs. Van Wie . " Oh , yes , thank you , Mrs. Van Wie . The child is doing nicely . Dr Murchison assures us that there is no cause for worry .

She will do well in bed , Murchison tells me . " " Sore throat ? " repeated Horace uneasily . " Fever ? " " Murchison supposes a mildly typhous condition of the body , Nothing alarming . " ( Horace swore under his breath . ) " He admini. tered the tar-water treatment , bled and purged her , and reduced t he swelling of the throat glands with a poultice of hops and vinegar . Mumpish . Nothing more , be assures me . " Horace said , " It was not mumps that killed her schoolmate at the Aurora Academy . " P167Mr . Jerrold started . " Kill  --  I know nothing of this .

" You do n't believe what you 're saying . Murchison is returning this afternoon . If she is not improved , he will bleed her again . " " Doubtless , " muttered Horace bitterly . He knew the accepted technicwith the lancet . Too often he had heard veterans of the old school quote with approval the Sedgwickian dictum , " In the case of a child under fifteen , bleed until the patient faints . " Poor Dinty would have her veins tapped again . Then , for a wager , there would be calomel and castor oil , followed with emetic doses of squills and syrup of onions . Anything to " weaken the fever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakened proportionately and perilously . There was nothing that he could do about it . The two men parted with sober visages . No further tidings came that day . Horace was at his breakfast ext morning when light , quick footsteps in the hallway , followed y a nervous rat-a-tat-tat on the door , interrupted his meal . He ropped a knifeful of beefsteak pie and hurried out . Wealthia Lathamstood there , her velvety eyes hazed , the color gone from the rich darkness of her skin . " Oh , Dr. Amlie ! Come ! Come , quick ! " " What is it ? " " Dinty . " He said , through a constricted throat , " It is not my case . I can not interfere . " Wealthia sobbed once , a rending sound . " She 's dying .

That 's better . That fetches it up . Try again . " The door was bolted . Horace shook it , then hammered upon it imperiously . This was no time for considerations of dignity . " Let me in ! Let me in ! " Mrs. Jerrold 's vain , pretty face , contorted with rage , confronted him . " What brings you here ? Get out of my house ! Go away .

Then they could hear her yelling to the hired man in the garden . " Fetch Dr. Murchison . Fetch Dr. Murchison . " The nurse whispered to Horace , " It 's the rattles , Doctor . God help the poor mite ! Two of mine went that way . " Anyone should have known it from the first for the dreaded croup , thought Horace bitterly , scanning the suffused and fever-swollen little face . Carefully he depressed the tongue . The appearance of the throat was dreadful . Already the terrible , pale membrane was forming . He dipped into the saddlebox for a vial . " Get me a feather , " he bade the nurse . " A long one . " A duster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slender partridgeplume . Horace dipped the end , held the girl 's mouth open , and delicately brushed the swollen channel through which the difficult breath came and went . He had the satisfaction of seeing part of the pallid scum dissolve . Dinty retched feebly . More of the membrane came up , and he cleared it away . Momentarily she breathed easier . But sad experience told him that the fiber would re-form time and again until the waning strength could no longer expel it . Silently he P169cursed the treatment which had already sapped the vitality of that sturdy body . Now she was quieter . And now there were heavy steps outside and the bumble of a pedantic utterance giving forth something about the necessity of cleansing the system from its evil humors . Cleansing , Indeed ! Dearly as Horace would have liked to bar out his colleague , his professional conscience forbade . Already he had trespassed furtherthan any medical board would condone . He stepped over and pcned the door . Dr. Gail Murchison stalked in , followed by Mrs. Jerrold . Ignoring e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedside ml laid a hand on the burning forehead . The fever increases , " he pronounced judicially . " Is  --  is she in danger ? " stammered Dorcas Jerrold . " What says the learned Dr. Hosack ? " replied Dr. Murchison acularly and answered himself , " That fevers are the greatest of all ttlets to human life . " The mother shuddered . " The case we have fore us , Mistress Jerrold , is anomalous . Anomalous , " he repeated . ny form of illness which he found complicated or unpromising , he talogued as anomalous , thereby exculpating himself in advance for possibly unfavorable outcome . " Did you offer a remark , sir ? " he id sharply to Horace . " No , " said Horace who had merely grunted . " If she is worse , " said the mother with a malignant glance at ( trace , " I lay it to him . Nobody knows what he has done to her . " " Have you presumed to interpose in my case , sir ? " grated Murchi-Horace recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The wild was choking . I cleared the throat with nitrate of silver . " " A dangerous procedure , " said the other solemnly . " I hold you p ' n Bible . " The swollen eyes opened . " Do n't let them vomit me again . Please ' t let them , Uncle Horace , " begged Dinty and was racked once re . " Quiet , my dear . " Horace caught the groping hands . His touch soothed her . She sank back . " I ) o n't leave me . Please do n't leave me . " " I wo n't . I 'll be right here . " But he wondered how long he could maintain his ambiguous position . Dr. Murchison appeared to be about to say something , but closed P170his jaws with a snap as he opened his lancet case . It was too much for Horace 's good resolutions . " What are you going to do ? " " That , sir , is not for you to inquire . " He selected a blade with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bleed her again ? " The other condescended to reply , " If you were a practitioner of experience , sir , you would have observed that the fever mounts . It must be checked . " " By God , you sha n't ! " said Horace . The thump of hooves sounded on the lawn . " Praises be ! " exclaimed Nurse Minnie . " Here 's the Squire 's self . " For a moment Horace thought that his colleague was going to use the keen steel upon him , so furious were the eyes that glared into his . " Ss-ss-sso ! " hissed Murchison . " You cozen my patient 's father in calling you upon my case and without due notification . A patien snatcher ! You shall hear of this from the censors , sir . " Horace knew that the threat was well founded . At the moment mattered less than nothing to him . His whole thought was for the small , huddled figure on the bed . Squire Jerrold hurried in . His wife ran to him , caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his . " Turn this young upstart out , " she shrilled . " He has forced hi self in here without warrant , and shut me from our child 's bedside . " Look at your daughter , sir , " said Horace quietly . The Squire passed to the bedside . Dinty did not know him . S was babbling . When he turned , it was not to Dr. Murchison but Horace Amlie . There was terror in his eyes . " Is she going to . . . ? " He could get no further . Horace pointed to the lancet , still in his rival 's fingers . " If she bled again , she wo n't live an hour . " " And I tell you , " blustered the other physician , " that unless hl ( is let the fever will burn her out before nighttime . " Mrs. Jerrold beat her hands together . " Will you listen to a you nincompoop like him against the experience and science of our o physician ? " she cried . " I will listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not lack for cunning . He shifted his grow " If this is a consultation , " said he smoothly , " I shall be happy consider my young colleague 's views before proceeding . " But Horace was not heeding . His anxious ears had caught a soundP171which meant another crisis approaching . Again he inserted the acidtippedfeather . But now the orifice was smaller , the effort to dislodge the choking barrier greater . There was audible to his practiced hearingthe beginning of that moist clacking which gave the disease its vulgar name of rattles . When the paroxysm had abated , he rejoined the two men . Dr. Murchison said weightily , " I recommend a sinapism for the soles of the feet . " ( Great God ! thought Horace . Not that it mattered ; the mustard plaster could do no harm or good , and Dinty was beyond feeling its Ming . ) " As the next step we should perhaps exhibit pyroligneous acid , " continued the elder . " Pyro  --  what for ? " demanded Horace . " To allay mortification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayed for patience . Dr. Murchison bumbled on . " There is also polygola seneka to be considered . I have found it ' , Jul in similar cases of exasperated mumps . " The patience which Horace had besought was not vouchsafed him . o you still diagnose this as mumps ? " he asked balefully . " Do you differ from my opinion , sir ? " " Here is too much talk , " broke in the father . " Doctors wrangle nd my daughter lies dangerously ill . What are her chances ? " Dr. Murchison cleared his throat . " I consider her in a soperose state . Horace said bluntly , " She is near to death . " The nurse lifted a pinched face , calling to Horace , " There 's anherattack comin ' on , sir . " l le returned to the bedside . Mrs. Jessup was bowed above the pillow , shutting out the free air for which the lungs were panting in agony . He set her aside , went to the window which someone had cd , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkening . The terrible problem was simply to keep the breath passing through . No longer would feather serve . Horace reached for his forceps and began gently to  --  n and draw the encroaching film . Someone behind him closed window . Without looking he drove his elbow backward , shatter-a pane . Now he took the next step , the insertion of a steel distenderto hold open the channel for the desperate breath . Slowly the paroxysm subsided ; the flush of fever succeeded to the P172leaden hue of asphyxiation . It would come again , that dire struggle , and again and again until . . . He must not think of that . Concentrateon what slender hope remained , and be ready for the last desperate , necessary measure . He bathed the hot face with cooling vinegar and water , rubbed the parched and cracking lips with a soothing amalgam of honey , beeswax , and sweet oil , and was rewarded with what he fondly believed to be a flicker of consciousness . Morning wore slowly to noon and passed into afternoon . If t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least no worse . The temperature was stationary at 1051/2 . But the pulse labored and flickered . It v as difficult to keep Dinty quiet when the delirium beset her ; yet every sound forced through the straining throat was so much essential strength expended . For a time the problem of keeping the passage clear enough for breath was simpler . This did not deceive Horace with undue hopes , The disease was the most treacherous of all the enemies he was called upon to confront . It lurked and struck . Dr. Murchison left at three o'clock to make his rounds . Horac overheard him promising to send a glazier to repair the sash . " If you do , " he threw over his shoulder , " I 'll put my boot throug it . " I will return at five o'clock unless summoned earlier , " said th departing physician to Mrs. Jerrold who was imploring him to stayThat hour found Dinty 's condition unchanged . But with the fal of darkness , the fever rose again . " Night air , " said Dr. Murchison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As if to bear him out , the figure on the bed shivered all over an stiffened . The choking set in . Strive as he might with forceps and probe , Horace could no longer keep the narrowed channel from clog ging . Dinty began to gasp . The cyanotic blue showed on lips and fin gernails . In her face the red of fever was supplanted by the dread lividity of slow strangulation . Horace dropped the forceps and caught up a blade from his lane box . " Aha ! " snarled Murchison triumphantly . " Now he bleeds her , Pray God it be not too late . " " Hold her head back , " Horace directed the nurse . " Farther . So . " " What are you going to do ? " gasped the Squire . " Tracheotomy . " " What is that ? What does he mean ? " cried Mrs. Jerrold .   " He 's going to cut her throat , " roared Murchison . " Murder ! Murder ! Murder ! " Mrs. Jerrold 's shrieks rang through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned Horace as she rushed at him , only to be taught and pinioned by her husband . His face was agonized as he whispered to Horace , " Must it be done ? " " She 's dying . Smothering . Ca n't you see ? Now let me alone . " He made the small , neat , perpendicular incision as he had once wen the great Vought do it over the protests of a group of consultants  --  thank God for that remembered lesson !  --  fixed a tube in the orifice , and heard the air rush , in great , life-giving gasps to replenish the flaccid lungs . Slowly the face changed from a leaden mask to the similitude of human flesh . The spasm-strained muscles relaxed . The cad was eased back upon the pillow where it lay quiet , no longer'sting and turning in the anguish of breath denied . And all the ime Murchison was bleating like a distracted sheep , " Tracheotomynot recommended . What says the learned De Weese ? Tracheotomynot recommended . " " He has cut our daughter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mend it ? " That would be a later problem for Horace to meet . The immediate isis was still acute . After midnight came the first real change . Alostimperceptibly the pulse abated . The fever dropped . Only a dec , to be sure , but it was hopeful . Horace got some warm milk with few drops of brandy into the stomach . Dawn found him still at his st . " I think she 'll do now , " said he unsteadily , and gulped the spirits Bich Squire Jerrold held out to him . Horace was still very young . n older and more experienced practitioner would not have put so much of himself into any case . Ile gave the nurse instructions and went home to wash face and nds in hot vinegar . Most of the authorities concurred in the theory Lich Dr. Murchison had aired , that croup , rattles , cynanche tracheIs , cynanche maligna , call it what one might , was " epidemic and not ntagious . " It was caused by uncomprehended climatic conditions , perhaps subtly poisonous exhalations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were strengthened when , a few days later , seven new cases appeared in the village , one of them Marcus Dillard . Dinty 's swain vered , but two children died . P174Horace made a deft repair of Dinty 's wound and anticipated , havingdone so well , being called in on some of the other cases . He was disappointed . By hint and innuendo Dr. Murchison , working so cunninglythat the evil report could never be traced to him , spread the rumor that the new doctor had cut a hole in Araminta Jerrold 's windpipe , despite the tears and entreaties of her mother , and that the poor child would never speak again . That she was alive after the experienceat the hands of so reckless an experimentalist was a mystery which Dr. Murchison could not explain , but covered by his familiar formula , " Anomalous , anomalous . A thoroughly anomalous case . " He awaited only the appearance of Dinty in public to bring in his indictment to the medical board . But the girl upon her release from the sickroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gail Murchison preserved his complete notes of the case future use . In his care of the convalescent , Dr. Amlie made certain obseryations . " How old is Dinty ? " he asked the father . " Fourteen . Why do you ask ? " " Why , she told me last year . . . " " Yes , yes , I know . " Squire Jerrold smiled . " She 's a strange chil She has always resented having to grow up . So she pretends to younger than she is . I would not say but what her mother has abet her in the harmless deception . " Horace suffered an inexplicable pang . Dinty growing up ! He f as if he were threatened with the loss of something precious . P175INTER broke early that year . The gangs , reinforced , attacked the round before the frosts were fairly out of it , Genter Latham 's being le earliest . Local advertisements called for two thousand pairs of nitted woolen gloves against frostbite , and many a weary housewife rued her bayberry candle to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer furbishings . The Latham squad , with lusty ng , pushed the cut through the village , west to east , between the rnpike and the creek . " Rochester to Albany in 1822 , " exulted Elder Strang 's weeklyrIan which , in a burst of local patriotism , had changed its name to r enFarmer &; Canal Advocate . Horace Amlie surveyed the foul mudholes formed by natural seep-c with a morose eye . " We shall have disease , " said he to Genter Latham and Squire rrold , as they sat on the Latham porch . " What kind ? " asked the Squire uneasily . " Dysentery and diarrheas certainly ; fevers probably . " " We 've always been a healthy village , uncommonly healthy , " protedMr . Jerrold . " So have the others , until the canal came , " returned Horace . " We rn nothing from their mistakes . See how sickness follows the canal . me fever , Montezuma malaria , Schenectady shakes . Our turn is ling unless we take action . " " Move the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " need Genter Latham .   " I 'd like to . Our worthy citizens have been using the ditch as a convenient dump-heap , drain and cesspool , " said Horace . " I could show ' em some things . " " Show ' em to us , " said Genter Latham . " Come to my office and I will . " With the first warm weather Horace had been collecting from the fouled accumulations of water , flies , mosquitoes , and other insects and preparing slides from what he found on their feet . One of these he fitted to his microscope while his two visitors stood , expectant . " Take a look , gentlemen , " he invited . Center Latham applied his eye to the barrel . Knowing him to be anything but an impressionable person and expecting little from the exhibit , Horace was agreeably disappointed . Mr. Latham was so impressedthat he vomited . " Fetch that contraption of yours to our meeting tomorrow , " said he after being restored with a tot of brandy . Both he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a public hearing , " added Mr. Jerrold . " Let ' em all hear what you 've got to say . " The Big Room of the Eagle was well filled with representative citizenry when , on the stroke of seven , Chairman Levering 's gavel descended . Rather sourly he announced that there would be a discussion of the town 's state of health . For his part , he could n't see but what they were doing well enough . Those things were in the hands of Divine Providence , so why go out to meet trouble before it arrived ? With which ungracious introduction Horace was invited to take the floor . He spoke briefly and modestly , citing the course of the fevers which had so hampered and delayed the canal 's progress . Would it not be well for the village to take measures in advance ? " What sort of measures ? " asked Trustee Van Wie . " Well , cleaning out some of our filthy dump-heaps and cesspools . " " Is this young gentleman from the Oneida wilds implying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uperaft . " You 've got a nose , " said Horace shortly . " Use it . " " I do n't poke it into other folks ' backyards . " " You might try your own . Your cesspool is surface-full . I can smel it in my office when the wind sets that way . " Carlisle Sneed , who had been patiently awaiting a chance to 1 funny , now saw and seized it . " Move we appoint Doc Amlie prix counselor to the town , " he giggled . The laugh apprised Horace that he was on the wrong track . P177man 's privy was his castle to every true American . He tried another angle . " There 's a compost heap at the bend of the creek that ought to be cleared away , " he said . " Dot 's my doomp-heap , " said Simon Vandowzer in his heavy , I ) utch drawl . " Vot 's de madder of it ? " " It breeds flies and mosquitoes . " " Vot off id ? Vot 's de madder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy . " " Hunca-munca ! " snorted Dr. Murchison . " Mr. Chairman , does my college-bred young friend insinooate that there is any harm to humans from the innocent winged creatures of the air ? " " Ever sit on a bumble bee , Doc ? " interpolated Mr. Sneed . " I do , " said Horace , answering Murchison , " mean just that . " " Maybe you hold that bugs carry disease . Is that it ? " " You once quoted the learned Dr. Hosack to me , sir . Are you aware that he held filth responsible for jail-fever and dysentery ? " " We ai n't in jail , " retorted his opponent . " And where 's your dys-entery ? " " It will come , " replied Horace boldly , " just as sure as present conditionsare left unremedied . I 'll stake my professional reputation on it . " Old Murch got out of his seat and paced the floor , stopping before his young competitor and thrusting a long and not-too-clean finger at him . Under the stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His voice became a throaty caw . " Git back to your fevers , young man . Now , you tell us a canal 11v catches canal fever . Huh ? And passes it along to human folks . I I uh ? Is that it ? " " Mosquitoes rather than flies . " " Oh-oh ! Moskeeters ! And how do the moskeeters do it , young fellow ? Tell us that . They catch it , says you . Did you ever see a moskeeterwith the shakes ? " He beamed triumphantly about him . The ( rin said that he guessed that would settle the young jackanapes 's hash . " It is believed that they carry fomites , " replied Horace , reddening . " What 's a fomite ? " " I do n't know precisely , but . . . " " I warrant you do n't . Nor nobody else . " " . . . but it is supposed to be a microscopic molecule that dissemitesthe disease principle which it absorbs from swamps and filth . "   " Listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flies carry the gut-wambles . Moskeeters catch the shakes and carry ' cm to you and me . Bats fetch around the yellow jaunders , I would n't won der , and jaybirds scatter the itch . Ever hear that the doodlebug 's bite gives you vapors on the brain , young fellow ? Sure you ai n't been bit by one , yourself ? " " Giving the town a bad name , " growled Mr. Van Wie . Discontented mutters arose in support of the complaint . Horace found himself confronted by the smug conservatism of settled and self-satisfied prosperity which resents any suggestion of change as a threat . " Mr. Chairman , " said Dr. Murchison , resuming his canonical air , may I offer an eloocidation of the problum ? " " We shall always be honored to hear from a gentleman of l ) r . Murchison 's wisdom and special knowledge , " said the Chairman pointedly . " Thank you , sir . My young colleague "  --  he waved a patronizing hand toward Horace  --  " is a sad example of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Let me first put him right on the nature of fever . All fevers are one and the same in essence , whether they are intermittent , remittent , bilious-remittent , lung fever , gut fever , or brain fever . They manifest themselves in different symptomsand stages . There is the simplex stage , the typhous stage , the depressive stage , the inflammatory stage and the malignant or putrid stage . The cause , my friends , is not in any silly bug-bite . It is in decayingmatter , such as leaves , plants and rotten wood which exhale gases , humors and dangerous miasmas to be absorbed by the human system . All this talk of bugs and fomites is so much huncamunca and folderol-diddle-de-day . No , no , my young and fancy-minded sir ! Do n't try to meddle with the laws of nature and the privies of your fellow citizens . When the fever comes  --  if it comes  --  we 'll handle it with the true-blue , old-style medicaments . " Squire Jerrold 's suggestion that the Board examine Dr. Amlic 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Squire said not unkindly to Horace , " You 'll never make a politician , my boy . " " Nor do I want to , " said Horace . " That 's all very well , " put in Genter Latham dourly , " but you 'd better get your disease-bugs working for you . Unless there are epidemicsof bellyaches and hot foreheads around here pretty soon , they 'll laugh you out of town . "   " Wait till it warms up a little more . I doubt if they 'll feel like laughing then , " returned Horace tartly . Nature came to the aid of the trustees . Steady rains covered thekd of the canal , drowning out the worst breeding places of the flies , and muddying up the water beyond the tolerance of even the hardi-. t anopheles larva . Intestinal diseases made their appearance withply 's heat , but not worse than in other years . Malaria was sporadic . Even among his pals of the smithy , Horace lost face . They reardedhim with easy amiability as a well-meaning but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population 's immunityrum the expected illnesses , Horace was threatened with a loss of faith himself , which , for a physician , is the beginning of the end . As embodying the spirit and hope of progress , a marine apparition , brim and shapely , took form in the stocks back of Palmer &; Jessup'smin . " The elegant and superb Packet Boat , Queen of the Waters , " announced Editor-Preacher Strang 's paper , " will plow the waves ereutumn paints our fair land with its rainbow palette . " Not all the traffic now plying the canal sections from Rome to Alnyso fired the patriotic souls of the Palmyrans  --  for , after all , to ine-tenths of the populace these far-off events were only hearsay , hereas seeing is believing  --  as the birth of the first craft to which nlmyra could point as its very own . The work was rushed . Earlier than the time set by the fervent aaphet , the packet , beflagged and beribboned , was played down the iys by the Palmyra Light Dragoons band in full uniform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called water , while e populace cheered itself purple in the face. ' their acclaim was premature . The fifty-fifty composite of mud d water , after deepening to a foot-and-a-half , dwindled to ten inches , hereupon the regal craft turned on her side like a sick fish and there ( lowed , in Carlisle Sneed 's regrettably coarse words , " as flat as a t on her bum in a puddle . " The Queen crawled back on her perch der cover of kindly night . Malaria broke out . Horace reported a dozen cases to Genter La-m who was unimpressed and quoted the proverb about the single ( low . His men were now working east of the village and pushing ; ad at top speed . But back of his project , the work still lagged . ' lire Jerrold 's camp , and several others were , as Old Bill Shea finnedHorace , " rotten with the shakes . " A hard frost early in September saved them , and the village as II , from a more disastrous epidemic . Every time that Horace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappearanceof the malaria and inquired solicitously whether his colleague was " still taking the pulse and temperature of your patients , the bugs . " That fall saw the marriage of Miss Agatha Levering and the Rev. Philo Sickel , to which Horace was magnanimously invited , and the establishment of Center Latham 's bank which the Reverend Mr. Strang editorially mistrusted as " a combination of the rich vs. the poor , a moneyed corporation whose power is a menace to free institutions . " Some of the older inhabitants felt uneasily that Latham was acquiring too much power and employing it too arrogantly for the town 's good . The great man went his way , disdaining hostility or , more often , ignoring it . Seldom did it take form in opposition . He was too powerful along too many lines . Ile had few friends and no intimatesexcept Squire Jerrold . He cared for nobody but himself and his daughter , in whose burgeoning , darkly radiant beauty he took an inordinate pride . The patronage of the Lathams now operated to Horace Amlie 's professional advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latham and Araminta Jerrold officially under his carwasbound to give him a certain cachet , though both were now awa at school , Wealthia at the Albany Academy . Through the winter h prospered , financially and socially , notwithstanding the detriment t. his reputation as a medical prophet of evil . Dinty Jerrold , home for Christmas , surprised him in a new uniform , resplendent with silken sash and a cocked hat with tricolor , plumes . He had just come back from the noon drill of the Light Dragoons . She was rapt in admiration . " Are n't you pompous ! " she cried . " Who are you beauing now ? " " Nobody , " answered Horace . " Of course you are ! Did n't you take Margaret Van Wie skating on the canal ? " she demanded , checking the items on her fingers . " And did n't you escort Eliza Evernghim on the party to improve the minister'swoodpile ? And who was it that invited Dora Macy twice to learned lectures ? And was n't Sarah Ann . . . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catechism . " She gazed at him pensively . " Do n't you like me to ask you ques-tions ?

I think you exhibit a certain interest in other people 's illairs . " Because I am interested . That 's just my mind standing up on tiptoeto see better . " " Who 's your local informant ?

I do n't believe it 's the tendecr passion . Do you , Uncle Horace ? " Horace grinned . " I hardly feel myself competent to judge . " " Sometimes I speculate a lot on the tender passion , " mused Dinty. is very muddling . D' you think there are some unhappy maidens at it never comes to , Uncle Horace ? " " I think you might better be speculating on your mathematics , " id he , brutally touching upon her weak point . Dinty was not to be diverted from the superior interest . " Have n't u something about it in your learned library , Uncle Horace ? " " Certainly , " said Horace and handed her a treatise on Quaterns . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loftily . She ted another volume from his desk and dropped it as if it were hot . was the revelatory Burns whose text , with illustrations , had beentopic of an earlier and unforgotten interview . Acutely conscious her shamed face , Horace reflected uncomfortably that this was a urged and more informed Dinty . A caller in the heavy woolens of a woodsman relieved the embarassment . As he entered , Dinty tactfully withdrew to the inner apartnt . She overheard an indistinguishable dialogue , then Horace'squery , " How far ? " " Not more'n five mile . "   " Can I get there on runners ? " " Most of the way . " " As soon as my footwarmer is heated I 'll start . " The man left , mumbling his thanks . Dinty , reappearing , said , " Oh , Uncle Horace , take me ! " Horace hesitated , peering out the window at the gray threat of the sky . " I 'll be as good as pie .

" Tip Crego , now installed as office boy and bill collector while 11 studied the classics with the doctor , was not at hand , so there was a empty seat . " Get your warmest clothes , " said Horace , " and come back here . She was on hand , clad in her heavy coat of otter , by the time had the warmer packed with coals . The case , he explained to h should not take long . It was a " putrid " wound of the hand , not cli cult to treat unless gangrene had set in . For some five miles they tra eled the fairly level Canandaigua Pike , then turned off on a rug woods road where they bumped and slewed and Fleetfoot picked way distrustfully . A few rods short of a clearing with a bare log ca in the center , they pulled up , the yard being impassable with stum Dinty wrinkled a delicate nose . " Pee-yoo ! " she sniffed .

" He blanketed the mare , tucked his passenger warmly about , a threaded the stumps to the door . Happy at being back in her belov wilds , Dinty burrowed down for a catnap . When she woke , dusk was already glooming . She saw Ilora plowing his way through the snow . His face was cheerful . " Is it all right ? " she asked . He nodded . " We 'll save the hand . Were you afraid ? " " Of course not ! I talked with a snow-owl for awhile , and then fell asleep . Tell me all about the case .

" she asked appreively . " I 'd better have a look . It might be someone in trouble . " " Who could it be ' way out here at night ? " " Somebody could be lost .

Once before , whenhomore on College Hill , he had heard the hunger cry of the t , stealthy cat , and in the morning had found the mark of the I pads on the snow . Again the air quivered to the meaningless grisly ululation . " Listen to me carefully , Dinty , " he bade her . " If I am not back ail i cm minutes , you go to the cabin for help . Keep your head now . I hold the mare firm . " For a moment he thought that she was going to defy his authority . wavered and sank back .

Pushing through theknee-deep in spots , Horace paused from time to time to amend direction , A clear , insistent call from the rear checked him . " Hoo-ee-ee ! Uncle Ho-race ! Hoo-ee-ee-ee !

" Horace admitted to himself a surge of relief . " Good child ! " he called back . " You 're a better woodsman than 1The outcries from the forest sounded fainter and less terrifyi now . There was a small watercourse somewhere in the vicinity ; sibly a wayfarer had fallen into that and injured himself . A bro leg , perhaps .

At first he saw nothing but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bristling with splinters . A dark blob on the snow , bar . identifiable as human , was almost hidden by the trunk beneath wh it was pinned . A dull , hurried babble rose from it . " Oh , bress God ! Bress my deah Saviour ! He done ansah prayer . Gress His name ! " " Link Zeb ! " cried Horace . He floundered to the side of the aged Negro . A glance told the nature of the accident . The white ash , most treacherous of tr. had sprung at the last ax-stroke and felled the feller , driving down into the snow until he was pressed against the hard earth neath , and inextricably wedging him there by wrist and forearm . In his youth Horace had accustomed himself to the ax . Attack the tree-bole as near to the prisoned form as he dared , he hack through it . Happily the severed lower end did not settle further , the victim 's arm would have been crushed beyond repair .

He blessed his Maker a : in his quavering basso , and fainted . Working to revive him , Horace saw outlined the record of grisly and brave tragedy , the almost hopeless struggle for life , de mined for every last , slender chance in accordance with the w ( man 's ritualistic and grim tradition . With his free right hand , i Zeb had scooped and packed the snow about his body for ware The best he could do for his legs was to burrow a little . Horace jud ; that both feet would be frozen , as well as the vise-gripped left a Within easy reach , the keen utility knife , without which no vertyro ever ventured into the wilderness , was driven beneath the to bark . Had the tree been a smaller one of pine , hemlock , or whitP185wood , its victim might have tried a race with death , cutting through it . Against the iron toughness of the ash the blade was futile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of rescue remained , when cold and the ebbing strength imperatively called for the last gamble , forest lore prescribed the desperate venture . The prisonerwould first cut strips from his clothing which he would place 1x  --  side him in readiness for application . Minutes , even seconds , would count now . For his one chance was to hew through the elbow joint , wvering the arm . How effectually he could staunch the spurting blood by ligature of the cloth strips , bound hard with hand and tooth , would determine whether he died on the spot . If he survived that rdcal , he must pit his last remaining powers against cold , night , andortal weakness in the struggle to gain the public road where thereas just a chance of being found in time . Such cases were not uncommon . No settlement was without its one-armed or single-footed ictims . But the graveyards held most of them . To carry the bulky form through the drifts would have been an overstrain for Horace Amlie 's supple strength . With bandages from is pack he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1f-conscious old man upon it , and , supporting the ends upon his shoulders , dragged his burden to where the cutter stood .

So close were they to the turnpike that it seemed best to make for tvn rather than take the nearer course to the forest cabin . Horace t his companion to rubbing the Negro 's arm and wrist with snow bile he urged the willing mare to her best speed . They made the inch in thirty minutes . Summoning the Cregos to build a fire in the hut , he examined his ticnt . Both feet were frozen as well as the left arm . But there was thing beyond repair . A few days of care , and Unk Zeb would be nut again . His account of his mishap was simple and commonplace . For the II and winter he had turned his hand to his old , slave occupation of sodcutting . Only the hardwoods fetched a living price by the cord , he located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Ile highway and cut systematically . After felling and portioning a  --  , he would " rope-snake " the logs to the nearest road , pile his tiers , I either sell on the spot or dicker for an ox-team to drag them to market . Being skillful , though slow , he managed to keep himself inP186food and clothes . The usual practice for the industry was for the cutter to leave word with his family where he would be working that day . But old Helms lived alone ; there was none to mark his comings and goings or to care . He would certainly not have been missed before morning , by which time he would be either dead or a one-armed " white-ash man . " " Who heah me fust ? " he asked Horace . " Miss Dinty .

The normal rains withheld . he sun blazed , day after cloudless day . The meager trickle of waters , eding the gash in the earth , was absorbed as fast as it mounted . The ly maritime enterprise visible was a toy sloop which Tip Crego had fashioned with his ready knife , as a gift to Dinty when she should turn . The town went into mourning , as after a disastrous defeat .

Her hope of canal traffic was unexpectedly borne out . For just the Palmyra churches were about to combine in a service of lament tion and contrition for the sins implacably punished by a rainle heaven , the drought broke . A mighty thunderstorm heaved its ma out of the western horizon , spread , and discharged , ushering in a two- day downpour . Ten thousand trickles raced down from the conical hillocks to con tribute to every little heights-born stream , pouring its swollen volume into the muddy excavation . Inch by painful inch the water gainc . The sun came out and so did the hopeful townsfolk to line towpat and berm and exultantly watch the descending floods .

Eager hands laid hold on the waiting Queen and propelled he bulk into the swirl of dark-brown , viscous fluid which fulfilled tha function of water sufficiently to buoy her proudly up . A cannon froth the War of 1812 fired a salvo . Two school squads , organized by sex , formed up on the south side . The boys were headed by a banner in-P189ribed " Village School " on one side , and " Science " on the other . The rls , led by Wealthia Latham , supported the twin sentiments , " Clin- &; the Canal " and " Internal Improvements .

What did this mean ? Had he cut into a rendezvous What sort of rendezvous , two young girls on this rough waterfront Tip Crego , perhaps . They were moving in the direction of Poverty ' Pinch . There was no harm in Tip ; he was trustworthy . Was it n time , though , that Dinty outgrew her nightfaring ? And Wealthi And the horses and costumes ? Horace revised his guess . This was innocent nature outing . A delicate thread of music , high and clear , thrilled along the currents , note upon silvery note , to be lost in the far silences . Wealth Latham twisted in her saddle . " That 's for the lock , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " said Dinty important " They 'd better not keep Captain Ramsey waiting . " " Captain , hey ?

" " You 'd both better get off the towpath , " suggested Horace . Wealthia 's dark eyes flashed . " I wish you 'd go away , " she cri " Make him go away , Dinty . " Dinty was sufficiently versed in Horace 's expression to know wh tact was indicated . " I do n't believe I could , Wealthia , " said s " Maybe we 'd better go home .

At the turnpike he checked the little cavalcade .   " Wealthia ! How far has this dangerous nonsense gone ? " " You 're not my pa . " Her face was mutinous . " Luckily for you .

" I do n't see why you ca n't ' tend to your own affairs , " she cornbled , adding , under her breath , " Meddling old neversweat ! " The Latham mansion was dark . Mr. Latham was away . The two Is dismounted in the barnyard . " I 'm spending the night with Wealthy , " Dinty said . I Ie gave her no response . Under his watchful eye the pair unsad-I and stabled their mounts . Dinty lingered , curling one foot around other ankle uncertainly , but he only sat his saddle like a disap-ving statue .

" I he neither moved nor spoke . She was testing to ascertain whether coast was clear . Once convinced that he had left , she would , he tined , pursue her assignation with the dissolute canaller .

To make certain that all was safe , Horace rode to the lower It Yes , the keeper said , the Firefly , Captain Silverhorn Ramsey , h leveled out at nine-fifty on her eastward way .

Why not ? " " I  --  I do n't want you to . " " Oh ! You do n't want me to . Any special reason ? " Dinty 's eyes slid sidelong away from his . She poked at a floor k with the toe of her boot .

With uneasiness Horace remarked Silverhorn Ram .. not of the circle , indeed , but watching the fair fledgling from a corn . He was a gaillard figure in his captain 's blue-and-gold , with a ti packet-boat woven upon the lapel of his supercloth broadcoat , as lolled gracefully . To Horace , Wealthia was still the little girl friend of the ot . little girl , Dinty . He preserved his attitude of protectiveness tow both of them impartially . It stirred anew as he observed Silverh. moving forward to join the group of swains . Had she signaled hi As he bent over her hand , Horace thought that her expression one of apprehension as well as fluttered and flattered delight . Shortly before midnight , that happened which was a frequent c. comitant of such festivities . A careless dancer knocked over a can . A curtain flared . Some fool shouted " Fire !

At the outset of his career he I taken a resolution never to meddle in the private and personal airs of any patient . That way lay infinite complications . But what4. would not do directly might be achieved through an agent . He reproducedthe subject with Dinty when he saw her next day . She ik lied a cavernous sigh . " Wealthy is cruel unhappy , " she informed him in her most impressive manner . " She 's desperate enamored . " " Childish infatuation , " barked Horace . " This is different .

The patient took the chair opposite . There was wafted from him the dainty odor of pomatum , shining on the long curls which rippled across his temples and draped downward to meet the luxuriant side whiskers . Notwithstanding his disability , P197he bore himself with that air of blithe self-satisfaction which was part of his charm . " Well , here it is , " said he . " I 'm figuring to marry .

" Well , I 'm not going to throw you out , much as I 'd like to . " Rounding the table , he stood above his patient . " Open your mouth . Wider .. " He set a hand on either side of the jaunty head , tilting it for the advantage of the light .

" But there had been a moment 's hesitancy .   " Sure it was n't the University of Pennsylvania Medical ? " " What if it was ? " " Ever deal in cadavers ? " Silverhorn twitched . The sound in his throat was hardly a remonse . " Three years ago several Penn medics were surprised body-snatchg . A mob caught two of them and operated on their ears before theyt away and disappeared . I could find out their names . " " Find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a rough-and-nnble . " " Not that ear .

" Mr. Latham will be advised to put a guard n his daughter until your record can be investigated . " " Why , you false invoice ! I 'm your patient . This is on your condentialoath , God blast your soul ! " Horace allowed himself a thin smile . " You have not consulted me Ibout your ear . That is not a medical but a police matter . " There was an interval of silence . Then Silverhorn said , " So you Kant me to bow off the girl . " " I do . " The handsome face became a leering mask . " Suppose it 's too late ? " " I ' 11 know that , too . I am her physician . " Another side of the incalculable blackguard showed itself . " Well , t is n't , " said he . " Not but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played different game this time . I 'm half-dozened on the little witch , to .11 truth , " he added ruefully . Horace wanted nothing now so much as to be rid of him .

Remember , if there 's any attempt on your part to see the prl , I go to Mr. Latham and the prosecuting authorities . Act like a lucent man , and I 'll keep quiet .

Take the medicine as directed . ; nod day to you , Captain Ramsey . " " Good day to you , Dr. Punk . " He retrieved his bugle and swaggered forth .

As he set it back , he heard a gasp . Silverhorn Ramsey stood in the open doorway , with protrud ing eyes . " Jesus ! " he whispered . Horace grinned at him . He knew that there was no longer anything to fear , once his rage had subsided . " Distilled water for microscopic use , " he explained . " Nicked ! " said Silverhorn lamentably . " What brings you back ? " " Your fee . I forgot it . " " I , also . Sixty-five cents , medicines included . " " Lawful money , " said the patient , laying down the sum . " Thank you . Mind my advice . No liquor . No women . " " What a life ! " said Silverhorn Ramsey .

Within the village limits , breaks and faults ingeological structure caused cellars to fill and noisome pools to her in depressions . The resourceful anopheles mosquito availed tsclf of these golden opportunities for egg-laying . Horace found a nnbcr of specimens , displaying their gauche and familiar attitude tinst inner walls . Having once suffered the discredit of the miscnprophet , he was chary of playing Cassandra a second time . He iced . Results were not long in showing themselves .

Happily it was a disabling , rather than a virulent type . B a new factor was present , an economic threat more disconcerting t h any physical woes . The place was getting a bad name . The evil wo " unhealthy , " was attaching to it . Wiseacres from the regions around surmised that the pestilent miasmas of the Montezuma Marshes h blown westward on prevalent winds and settled down upon the v ley . While the affliction was at its height , flies reinforced the in. quitoes and contributed their quota of befoulment with the res of adding the gripes to the shakes . Palmyra was an unhappy town .

Coach passengers manifested a tendency to av the local inns and bed down farther along the line . Custom at t Eagle fell off by a round quarter . New money ceased to flow into t village . Several projected businesses , including a chandlery and storehouse , delayed construction . Worst of all , the danger loom that the canal authorities might abandon their announced plan , ul which the village was capitalizing , to establish a local pay-office wi all the consequent influx of ready money , and to make the two basi soon to be enlarged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locality .

Another bid issued from the vicinity of L Port where work was under way on the Western Section .   " Dig , Dry-shod and in Comfort , " invited the contractors .

" At a meeting of contractors and sub-contractors , the question of increased wage-scale was mooted . Genter Latham , the largest emer , vehemently opposed it . " No digger is worth more than four shillings a day and damned of ' em that much , " was his dictum . Nevertheless Squire Jerrold sent out a call for one hundred and men at sixty cents a day , almost precipitating an open quarrelCenter Latham . Lock Port raised its bid to seventy-five cents , was followed by a like raise in the Montezuma area . Palmyra was . atoned with paralysis . About this time , Editor-Pastor Strang , ly afflicted in his bowels and with recurrent shakes to boot , re-f from journalism , turning over his plant to a pair of energetic ng men , Messrs .

" ' You do n't look well . " " You 're nothing to brag of , yourself , " retorted the other with a k grin . " I do n't get much rest , these nights , " admitted Horace , whose tice had increased beyond normal endurance . " We 're calling a town meeting tomorrow evening , " said Mr. La- " About time , too .

Nothing short of impending cats trophe could have dragged so many of the leading figures from the , beds of pain and uncertainty . Chairman Levering , blinking out a Ix ) a sea of pallid faces , poised a tremulous gavel and , with a chittcrin jaw , proceeded to " c-c-call this m-m-m-m-m-meeting to orrrderrrrr Simultaneously two trustees raced for the door with identical expr. sions of anguish and foreboding . Dr. Murchison in a front-row chit bent over a stout cane , his skin of that unsightly hue termed " puk except in the daintier prints which refined it to " puce . " The old ma with a temperature which Horace Amlie expertly guessed to be least 102 , was game . Horace , himself , was gaunt as a ferret from sleeplessness a  --  overwork . Several times during the proceedings he was called u to escort tremulous gentlemen to their distant goal . Palmyra 's cla , to be the healthiest settlement along the canal was not being w supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to town 's growth and prosperity , Mr. Genter Latham ( temperat 101  --  ) moved that Dr. Horace Amlie be invited to express his id The motion was seconded by Trustee Van Wie ( twelve pounds derweight ) . Horace , who had fallen asleep on his bench from exilahi tion , hauled himself to his feet and surveyed the assemblage with s  --  and uncompromising eyes . " Well , " said he , " how do you like it ? " A mutter of discontent answered him . " You do n't like it . Neither do I. You 're getting just what asked for . " Up rose the Honest Lawyer , shivering like a leaf . " Are you p suming a lay upon us the blame for a visitation of Heaven ? " he cll. lenged . " It 's a judgment of Heaven , I agree , " said Horace . " But for what " Our sins , " said Deacon Dillard piously . " Just so . Filth is a sin . And sickness is the judgment . " The Rev. Theron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , felt impelled to dissent mildly from this heterodoxy . I it and flies were of Beelzebub , he admitted , but there was no Script uP205warrant for attributing disease to them , as his young friend implied . I ) r . Murchison , for the medical faculty , concurred with the parson . Tenderly rubbing his distended abdomen , he repeated the timehonoredtheory of miasmatic poisoning . Horace stepped to the plat-()rm . " Those of you who are queasy or incontinent had better leave , " is warned . " I 'm going to make you sick at your stomachs . " " Not me , " announced Carlisle Sneed . " I got no stomach left to x  --  sick at . I 'm quitting . " He tottered out followed by several other %offerers . Horace extracted a covered fruit jar from his tail pockets and set it down on the table with a bang . It was half full of dark blobs , some , uf which appeared to be in a state of fermentation . " Flies , " he said . " Collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Mr. Van Wie volunteered , and was obliging enough to gag viontly . " Anyone else ? Dr. Murchison ? Mr. Uperaft ? " The Honest Lawyer shook his head . " What if they do stink ? " said e contentiously . " So does a skunk . But a skunk 's juice is healthy . is good for a rheumy cold . Ai n't that correct , Dr. Murchison ? " " A skunk , " said Horace , " is a cleanly and respectable creature side a fly . So is the dirtiest hog that ever wallowed in a swill-pile , r the foulest crow that ever scavenged in carrion . I 'm going to tell ni something about the flies that light on the food you eat . " With simple directness that brought out every point of disgust nil nausea , he gave a five-minute character sketch of the local muscae , lief r breeding and feeding habits , their capacities as freighters of It f i , and the human ailments which , in the opinion of enlightened Bence , they bore with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appetizing mosquito . When he sat down the huethe faces below him was greener by several degrees . Maltster Vanwizer swallowed a brace of pills from the palm of his hand and broke to uncomfortable silence . " Veil , vot do ve do ? Vot dons de yong man vant ? " " An appropriation for quicklime . " " Vot you do vid it ? " " Lime every drain and cess in town . Scatter and lime such corn  --  t heaps as yours . " " Do you warrant that to cure our gripes and fevers ? " asked Upft . P206Horace was not thus easily trapped . " I 'll warrant the dysentery will lessen , " he replied . " Give me more money to treat the mosquito breeding pools and I 'd almost warrant the fevers . " " I maintain that there is insufficient evidence against the accused insects , " insisted the always lawyerlike Honest Lawyer . Horace had begun to tell them of the experiment at Shea 's camp , when Deacon Dillard interposed the objection that they were deal ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild country where it might be quite different . He sat down , surrounded by the reek of mint juice which clung about all who worked in the minteries . It gave Horace an idea . " Deacon , I 've heard that you boast your workmen are the healthiestin town . " " It 's true , too . " " Do you know why ? " " Because I pay ' em well , treat ' em well and feed ' em well . " " That 's well known . " Horace was not above currying favor by discreet and honest flattery . " But it is n't the whole story . " " What 's your way of it , then ? " " Are you bothered with flies in your distillery ? " " No , sired " " Or mosquitoes ? " " Never see one of the dum things . The smell of the good mint keps ' em away . " " There 's your evidence , sir , " said Horace , turning upon the HonestLawyer . " The Dillard establishment stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mosquitoes ; hence , no fevers . " Post hoc , sect non propter hoc , " growled Uperaft . " That ai n't proof . " " It 's flub-a-dub-dub , " declared Murchison . Chairman Levering joined the attack . " You say the canal breed : disease ? " " It does . The fevers have followed its course . " " Then you would do away with the canal , would you ? " " That 's it , " broke in Jed Parris . " Blow up the poxy Ditch and go back to honest teamin ' . " Genter Latham was on his feet , his face aflame , his eyes brilliant with fever , but his mind under cool control . " That 's what it might come to , fellow citizens , " he said with forcefulquiet . " That , or as bad . If the present excavations are abandoned , if the canal is carried northward to the lake , east of us as the anti- P207Clintonian busybodies would have it , do you know what it means to Palmyra ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed through his audience . That might all be so , somebody grumbled , but was it any reason for giving this young medical upstart the town 's money to spend on bug-fights ? The economy argument was stressed and backed by citationsof householders ' rights . Dr. Murchison heavily ridiculed the younger man 's " fairy-tales with flies for hobgoblins . " Chairman Lever-i ng 's personal enmity for Horace inspired him to an attack upon the young doctor 's professional ability . On the other hand , what Squire Jerrold called the " argumenturn ad nauseam " had made an impression . Deacon Dillard swung to I brace 's support . Decker Jessup , O. Daggett , Silas Bewar and others  --  f the smithy coterie were there to back up their fellow member . Vhen , after sundry threats of personal violence had enlivened the proceedings , the question was put to general vote , the clean-up forces were found to have won decisively . Horace went to work . In three days he made himself the besthatedman in Palmyra . With twenty-five dollars ' worth of lime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outhouses , found offenses in the gardens of such respectables as the Leverings and the Evernghims , scattered Simon Vandowzer 's maggot-breedery , and substituted the pungent tang of the chemical for the more familiar and homey odor of the hot-weather latrine . Lawyer Uperaft , scenting possible business among the new smells , tried to stir up some of his clients to suits for trespass . It came to nothing , because Genter Latham announced that he would bring the best legal talent of the state , at his own expense , to defend Dr. Amlie and his " limers . " At once the dysentery tapered off , presently dying out . But the fever was more obstinate . While new cases were fewer , the incidence was still above normal provided by the comparatively inconsiderable breeding places of the creeks , now supplemented by the canal pools . Both Latham and Jerrold warned Horace of the impracticability of obtaining a grant for draining these latter . Stoutly though he had spoken for it , the proponent of the mosquito theory realized that his case was neither proved nor proveable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fomites . " Read as he might , all procurable data  --  and these were preety scanty and scattered  --  left him with a disturbing modicum of doubt at the back of his brain . If the fomites were , indeed , microscopical agencies of disease lurking on the person and in the clothing of the afflicted as well as inhabiting the unhealthfulP208swamps and marshes , then it was only reasonable to believe that flying insects could and did transport them from place to place , from sick man to well man . Unfortunately no microscopist had yet succeeded in identifying a fomite . If Horace could have produced a sketch of a horrendous crawler , bristling with horns , fangs and stingers , what a telling argument he would have had for the general public ! Lacking such concreteevidence , he was prudently inclined to go slow after the initial clean-up . The taunt of " bugs on the brain " had hurt . He had a natural distaste for his growing reputation as a gratuitous busybody , a medical neversweat . Anyway , he had accomplished one good . Palmyra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Montezuma district . Mysteriously quiescent for months , the fever returned there in exaggerated virulence . Half the working force was laid off . Several deaths were reported . Lock Port and the Western Section still held out their lures , but there , too , malaria appeared . Palmyra deserters began to drift back from both directions to their old jobs . They found the village almost free of sickness . Horace Amlie was doing a good job . Not without opposition , however . Lawyer Uperaft threatened him with the law . Crabbed old J. Evernghim menaced him with a blunderbuss . T. Lay barricaded himself within his brookside privy and announced that if any man tried to interfere with his rights , he'dsquib him like a fowl . Mr. Levering , himself , in spite of his official position , mounted guard over the assorted fragrance of his backyardcompost heap , and Horace was obliged to level it at dead of night and n careful secrecy . All of which did not add to his popularity . " How would you like to be appointed special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " To give you official authority . " " I 'll need it . " " Do n't overdo it . You 're getting yourself disliked already . " " So are the flies , " grinned Horace . Only the fact that they had suffered so bad a scare induced the P210grudging trustees to make the appointment . Thus Horace Amlie , M.D. , became the first public health official in the United States . Center Latham lent him prestige by permitting a darn across his noisome brooklet , since it was no money out of the Latham purse . Dinty , hearing the news , wrote from Albany where she was not too happily settled in school . Will you wear a uniform ? And carry a staff ? I shall be more afraid of you than ever . Do hasten with your old canal so that Wealthy and I may come back on it soon . This is a plaguey fine city , the home of Culture , Refinementand Fashion , and there are many Estimable Young Gentlemen who are admitted to pay their respects at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evening . But the forest is far away , Hudson 's Raging Waters roll between , and the Night Watch stalks abroad . Golden prophecies to the contrary , there was no prospect of an better method than that of the coach for the accommodation of th two little exiles . Still the progress of the canal had become alm normal again . Of the hundred and fifty men sought by Squire je rold , more than one hundred answered his call , and Center Latha was compelled to raise wages to a parity with the rate paid by h neighbor , which he did with a very ill grace . To the east , arou Lyons and Clyde , the work still lagged , but the reaches along G nargwa Valley steadily deepened and leveled . Inspectors arrived , representing the Canal Commission . Palmy held its breath . Rumor solidified into authentic good news when the Canal Advocate abandoned its basic principle of printing nothing local interest to announce that the waters would be let in simultaneously from the Genesee River , Thomas 's Brook , and the Canandaigu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes of the citizen would be gladdened by a nautical pageant , followed by a banquet an a ball .

It never did , because the Commission inconsiderately put a five-mile limit on all canal craft . ) P211Full of patriotism and pride , Genter Latham , who had been to dew York City on a business trip , stopped at Albany to pick up two yous young creatures , freed for the occasion from scholastic tramtcls . Both were objects of marked attention from several of the male itch-fares , to Mr. Latham 's surprised enlightenment and their own Manifest satisfaction . He had not bargained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived in time for the girls , very much bedizened , to take art in the pageant , Dinty as the Spirit of Erie , Wealthia as the Muse Transportation . The banquet which followed was the most eleu ) tin the history of the town . Squire Jerrold , the toastmaster , struck the keynote in his initial proposal , " Palmyra , the Beacon City of InrnalImprovements . " " Westward the star of empire takes its way , " he proclaimed . " I nture to assert without fear of successful confutation that Divine providence has appointed our community to become the metropolis the western region and eventually a second capital of the Empire ile . Twenty-two toasts were responded to , and , as appropriate and ttal , the guests got patriotically tipsy and helped one another home . Ilorace Amlie stayed sober , not from lack of community spirit , -t because he had a busy morning in prospect , including an operaanfor the stone which would be agonizing for the patient and a rresponding nerve-strain for the surgeon . He finished it , successful t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed dram , when e note of Silverhorn Ramsey 's bugle warned him of that flamboyant ruin 's imminent arrival . The young captain was in town for the stivities , Horace surmised . The door was pushed open and the itceful figure lounged in . " I 've come for my bill of clearance . " I Iorace caught a whiff . " You 've been drinking , " said he . " Now , by the bowels of Beelzebub ! Ca n't a man take a single nip hhout being scathed for it ? " " I low can you expect favorable results if you do n't follow directions ? " " Damn your directions , you harping Hippocrates ! I 'm cured . " " I hear you say so . We 'll see . " I Iorace went over him carefully . " You 're improved , " he admitted . " Fit for the merry wedding bells and the parson 's blessing , " intheyoung blade . " Not yet . " Horace leaned forward to touch the other on the knee .   " Make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Ram . sey , " he added sternly . " Oh , the rib ! Do n't worry . I 've got other projects , " was the careless reply . " As many as you like , so they do n't include marriage . " " What 's that to you ? It 's not your patient , I tell you . Our agree ment covers only her . Is n't that true ? " Horace was constrained to admit it . " Then keep your damned hands off ! " He laughed . " Oh , well Do n't look so sour over it . Shall I tell you what ails you , young 1E. culapius ? You 're carrying other people 's consciences on your shou ders . Where 's the profit in that ? What do you get out of it ? " " Nothing that you 'd understand . " Silverhorn looked about him . " They tell me you 've got the witch ' bastard from Poverty 's Pinch in tow . " " I 've taken on the Crego boy as my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him ? " Horace looked hard into the derisive eyes opposite . " Take the powders as directed , Captain Ramsey . Come for further examinatio in ten days . " Silverhorn declined to be squelched . He pocketed the preparation slid a half dollar across the table and observed , " The brat ought to take kindly to medicine . That old she-wol knows some useful things . " Gossip to that effect had already reached the physician 's ear " Such as what ? " " Ask the Settlement girls . " " I 'm asking you . " " Going to try and put her in jail , too ? " " I 'm going to put a stop to any illegal practices that I discover . " Blueskin ! " commented Silverhorn and followed it with a resounding " gardaloo " which , from his full lips bore a particularly rich mea ure of contempt . " You wo n't discover it from me . If Quaila helps poor girl out of trouble once in a while , where 's the harm ? " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Phutt to you and all your blue-nosed kind ! I say she 's a good witch as far as that business goes . It 's a line of practice I thought of taking up , myself , if I 'd finished my medics . " " I 'll live to see you hanged , yet , " said Horace hopefully . " Maybe . But I 'll have had my fun , which is more than you will old sourgut . I 'll be singing in hell when you 're itching in heaven .   " Do n't let me keep you from your occupations , " said Horace politely . " Is the Firefly tied up here ? " No more Firefly . Have n't you heard ? " No . You 're not quitting the canal ? " " I 'm captain and owner now . The Jolly Roger . She 's a Durham , upper-built . Makes her five miles against wind and current .

" Curious as to the change of fortune , the physician accepted . At the in he had no difficulty in picking out the Jolly Roger . The skull ! crossbones of blatant piracy flew at the forepeak . Although but a ighter , she carried all the style of a packet ; a cedar deck , two re-'ting lamps at the prow , boat 's name and owner 's name in colors , e and aft , a carved tiller-bar ; every appurtenance in the whole enty-foot length shipshape and of the smartest . " You 've got a boat there ! " said the visitor admiringly . " Twelve hundred dollars as she came off the ways . " " Did n't hit the grand lottery , did you ? " " Easier than that . I borrowed the stake against my marriage . " I brace frowned . " Must I tell you again . . . ? " " Sheer off , " the captain interrupted . " You 're my doctor , not my non . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His face darked ; his eyes looked angry and hungry . " Let that content you . " " Who is the lucky bride ? " asked Horace grimly .

" He ilcd . " I 'll be sleeping in a berth more often than in a bed when ough navigation opens . Well , keep your weather eye peeled and tr towrope taut . I 'll see you at the ball , later on . " I brace stared hard at him . " You 're going ? " " Why not ? " was the bland reply . " Silverhorn 's a good little boy . w . Fit for any society . " I was no fault of Dinty 's that she had not seen her Uncle Horace immediately upon her return . On the pretext of a small and assiduslycultivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new quarters . Both times he was out . On her second call she wanted to wait , but vainly . Admitted by Unk Zeb , she inspected the mises with a critical eye which observed dust in places beyondP214male discernment . Plainly her attentions were needed . To her sati faction , the sampler worked by her youthful hands had a place c honor on the office wall , between the Hamilton sheepskin and t l State Medical certificate . The more interesting of his medical book however , as she discovered to her resentful disappointment , wet under lock and key . Now that she was growing up , there was maul in some of these volumes , she felt sure , that would be profitable for her to know . It was mean of Uncle Horace to keep them segregated . On the day before the cotillion Horace had his first conversation with her . She was sitting in the bay window of the Jerrold household as he came in sight on Fleetfoot , having attended an accident at tlj ropewalk . She had been reading Gilpin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not her habitual choice I literature . This might mean any one of several things , the most like ) being that it was an imposition of penance for breach of domesicated discipline . Upon catching sight of the doctor , she flung Gilpin in a corner and rushed to the door , yoo-hooing in what her mother aft ward stigmatized as an unmaidenly and hoydenish manner . Horace vaulted out of the saddle , leaving Fleetfoot " hitched to t grass , " and went to meet her . It was cleaning day and , although t Jerrolds kept a living-in , seven-day hired girl , the daughter of t household was expected to help , wherefore she was still in ap and kilted-up skirts , and looked to Horace but little older than t Tilly Tomboy who had first amended the Widow Harte 's frown housewifery . She hurled herself upon him . " Oh , Uncle Horace ! " she bubbled . " I am so glad to see you ! I much changed ? " She preened herself , expectant . " Not a bit , thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she pouted . She felt for the p ' pie , but it was , unfortunately , gone . Her skin was like the inner cu of a roseleaf . " Are you going to the ball ? " " I had n't given it much thought . " " Do , " she urged . " Think about me , too . You could invite me dance . " " Would n't that make young Mr. Marcus Dillard jealous ? " teased . " Oh , Mark ! " She tossed her head . " Two young gentlemen from Albany of the highest respectability have come up on purpose attend Wealthia and me , " she said complacently . P215Picturing the highly respectable young gentlemen as callow , Horace smiled indulgently . " You will come , wo n't you , Uncle Horace ? " she pleaded .
