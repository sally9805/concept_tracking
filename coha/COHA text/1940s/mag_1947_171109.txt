Two figures released in Washington last week dramatized world hunger as well as figures could . The first dealt with food . Reported Secretary General Dennis A. FitzGerald of the 35-nation International Emergency Food Council , after a tally of world harvests : this year 's food production would come to only 93% of prewar . <P> Despite the millions in Europe and Asia to whom World War II brought death , * FitzGerald 's survey estimated that world population had risen by some 200,000,000 in the past decade . This was like adding " another North America " to the claimants for the world 's food supply . <P> Said Economist FitzGerald with dry , official understatement : " Unprecedented efforts-national and international-will be required . . . . There seems little prospect that the world can work its way completely out of its food difficulties . . . for some years to come . " <P> <P> *Secretary of State George C. Marshall this week estimated that more than 15,000,000 men in World War II were killed or missing .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
