THE CONGRESS <P> In Salt Lake City in 1890 , snow-bearded Wilford Woodruff , then President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , received a revelation from the Lord that the world was not yet ripe for the doctrine of plural marriage . Forthwith he banned it , ordered immediate excommunication of all Mormons who insisted on the full life , including polygamy . That obstacle at last removed , Utah was admitted to Statehood , although Reed Smoot , Mormon Senator , was n't sure of his seat until after an exhaustive Senate investigation had disclosed that Mormons did not have two horns and a tail , as charged . <P> Last week another Mormon went to the Senate . Nevada 's Governor E. P. Carville ( a Catholic ) appointed to the seat of the late Key Pittman a 34-year-old L. D. S. bishop , Berkeley Lloyd Bunker , a Texaco filling-station operator of Las Vegas , Nev . <P> Senator-Bishop Bunker , 5 ft. 10 in. , stocky , with dark wavy hair , heavy eyebrows , Clark Gable ears and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like the late Brigham Young , he loves to dance. * He observes the Word of Wisdom ( no tobacco , tea , coffee or strong drink ) , chews hundreds of sticks of gum annually ; as a bishop he marries , buries , and manages church affairs without remuneration . High-school educated , the son of pioneer ranchers , he entered politics four years ago as a Young Democrat , topped the ticket in 1938 in a race for the Legislature , became Speaker of the Assembly in 1939 , was re-elected to the Assembly this year . <P> Although a friend of the Governor , he had not even a wild dream of a Senate seat , wept most of the night after the appointment . He called his wife long distance . She said : " My gosh ! " Said Governor Carville : " He typically represents the young manhood of Nevada . This nation today is calling upon its young men . . . . " <P> As the Senate 's age average dropped , with oldsters being replaced by such men as Senator-Bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its Mormon quota had gone up . Already sitting were Saints William H. King and D.Thomas of Utah . Lame Duck King will be replaced Jan. 3 by chubby Saint Abe Murdock . One indirect Mormon loss : the passing from politics of Mormon-admiring Henry F. Ashurst of Arizona . <P> *No prig , Brigham Young founded the Salt Lake Theatre ( where Maude Adams first appeared on stage , age 9 months ) as one of his first creations ; organized the still flourishing Young Men 's &; Women 's Mutual Improvement Associations , whose sessions ended in dances , which were ( and are ) always opened with prayer . Pioneer Young wanted young Mormons to have their fun in church , not taverns.
