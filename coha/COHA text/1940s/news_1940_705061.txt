txt Officials of the American Red Cross here are growing more and more conscious every day of a definite " fifth column " effort to sabotage the work of the nation 's long-established humanitarian agency . From out over the country come such rumors as these : A woman who made a sweater for a Belgian refugee received a note from a German soldier saying he was wearing it and enjoying it very much . Ground glass had been found in certain Red Cross surgical dressings : and ns a result the Red Cross has ordered these All to be made under close supervision . Dresses made for European refugees by Red Cross patterns were so baggy and ill-formed that they could not be worn . In these and other tales apparently going the rounds of Red Cross workrooms and women 's sewing circles , officials at national headquarters see undercover work on the part of some group trying to stir up dissension against the Red Cross . Facts Contradict Rumors Tho answers to these rumors are : Not a single penny or garment has gone to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ever shipped to Belgium ; a German soldier could not write to an American benefactor because all notes and addresses are carefully removed before garments are shipped abroad . Surgical dressings have always been made in chapter headquarters rather than at'home because of the complexity of specifications . As many persons are complaining about the Red Cross ' use of Vogue patterns as are complaining of the garments ' " bagginess . " German agents have a definite cause for stirring up strife in this country against the Red Cross that they did not have Jn the World War . In those days , the Red Cross was a neutral agency , overlooking the rights and wrongs of international warfare and alleviating suffering wherever found , even behind enemy lines . Today with war engulfing civilian populations as well as armies food is looked upon as much of a weapon in the fight against aggression as are tanks and airplanes . Better to aid the conquered populations of Europe to throw off the yoke of Naziism and aggression now , through hunger , than to abet the dictators by shouldering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promIse to " protect " the people of Europe . That Is United States foreign policy . That is the policy governing Red Cross activity today . British Blockade Respected The lag shipment of Red Cross supplies to the Continent reached there early in July . Since the fall of France , Britain 's blockade has been scrupulously respected . Not even the unoccupied area of France is getting any Red Cross aid today . Nine freight cars of milk and other foodstuffs purchased in Switzerland were sent to Paris to be distributed under careful supervision of American Red Cross officials to children and prisoners of war in the environs of Paris during the coming months . One car was reported lost for a while , but it has since been found , supporting Red Cross assurances that not one mouthful of food nor one garment , sent from this country has fallen into Gorman hands . Meanwhile , the American Red Cross has turned its attention to the British Isles where , according to latest reports , it has sent approximately $4,225,000 in money and supplies to date . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nursing bottles to ambulances , have gone forth to help supply the needs of some 15,000 homeless families . Over 500,000 garments made by American women have already been shipped for distribution by the British Women 's Voluntary ' Services , headed by Lady Reading . Ample Food for Britain Shipments of food to Britain have been discontinued because of plentiful supplies there . Latest American Red Cross gift to the British were 12 canteen units , made up of " snack-bars , " " ten-vans , " and miscellaneous trucks that can be rushed out to feed people in bombed sections of London , However subtle the propaganda against the Red Cross may be , officials are certain that to date it has had little success in undermining confidence in their organization . The effect has been to tighten up public opinion behind Red Cross policy . For the lust two months , headquarters here have been swamped with letters wanting assurance that the Red Cross will not relent in its decision not to aid people in German-occupied areas . Whether they contributed $1 or $1,000 to the Red Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for food that might in any way contribute to better breakfasts for airmen back from raining bombs on tho British Capital .
