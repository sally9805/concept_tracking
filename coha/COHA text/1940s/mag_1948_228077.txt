Bad manners became fashionable in big-time tennis after World War I. Suzanne Lenglen and Big Bill Tilden set the style - and the pace . One day on the French Riviera , so the story goes , a hot-tempered Austrian almost outdid everybody when he won a tournament ; openly sneering at the tiny silver trophy that was presented to him , he set it down in midcourt and squashed it flat with a roller . Last week , in Paris , tomboyish Patricia Canning Todd , No. 4 among U.S. women players , did her bit to keep the tradition alive . <P> When officials asked her to play a semifinal match on a side court , Patricia had a fit of sulks . The more she thought about it , the madder she got . Said she : " I told the committee I would play only on the center court . I 'm the defending champion and I do n't see why I ca n't play on the center court . . . " Just to show them , Pat flounced out of the stadium . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory by forfeit . <P> A few hours later , after Pat Todd had calmed down , and apologized , the committee decided to play the match if the French star consented . But Winner Landry was not to be found .
