The upper west side of Manhattan , an area thick with university buildings and theological seminaries , is dominated by two great churches-the towering Rockefeller-built Riverside Church and the huge , unfinished Protestant Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Divine . Last week each made news . <P> Baptist Arrival . Plain-talking , liberal Harry Emerson Fosdick wanted to retire three years ago as pastor of the Riverside Church . His trustees persuaded him to wait out the war , later agreed to fix the date as his 68th birthday : May 24 , 1946 . Last week , with that date at hand , the congregation announced his successor , Robert James McCracken , 42 , professor of church history and the philosophy of religion at Ontario 's McMaster University . <P> For Professor McCracken-who is as Scottish as his name-Riverside will be only his third parish , though his first this side of the Atlantic . Born in Motherwell , Lanark , and educated at Glasgow University , he had churches in Edinburgh and Glasgow , then became a lecturer in systematic theology at the Baptist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called to his present chair in McMaster as assistant professor . But though this will be his first U.S. job , he is no stranger to Americans , to whom he has delivered many a lecture and sermon ( three at Riverside Church ) . <P> Like his predecessor , Dr. McCracken is a Baptist , but Riverside will continue as the liberal , essentially undenominational institution that Harry Fosdick made it . <P> Episcopal Departure . New York 's Episcopalian Bishop , the Right Reverend William T. Manning , may sometimes have looked to laymen like a U.S. Archbishop of Canterbury , but he is too solid a churchman to make that mistake himself . * His unerring knowledge of the rules and his uncompromising adherence to them have been the admiration of his close subordinates and the discomfiture of his Episcopalian antagonists . Bishop Manning has almost always been right . That rigid position has not endeared him to his opponents-or to the public ; his vigilant guardianship of orthodoxy has often made New York 's Bishop look something of a prim curmudgeon . <P> For a quarter-century he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 252 parishes ) , rich ( 1944 income , $4,000,000 ) diocese of New York . Last week the 79-year-old British-born cleric , who remained stubbornly unbudging two years ago when he Church 's General Convention voted compulsory retirement for bishops at 72 ' , announced that he would retire next fall . <P> <P> To low churchmen , Bishop Manning seems only a split hair 's breadth this side of Rome . He campaigned to change ( he might say " restore " ) the Church 's name from Protestant Episcopal to " Catholic &; Apostolic , " drew many an ecclesiastical brickbat for declaring in 1930 : " The conception of the ministry held by the Protestant Churches is in important respects different from that held by the Episcopal Church . The Episcopal Church holds the Catholic doctrine of the priesthood . . . . The unbroken order of the episcopate coming down to us from apostolic times is the visible , living witness of God 's coming into this world in the Incarnation . . . . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
