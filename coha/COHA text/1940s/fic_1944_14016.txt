TIME : Mid-afternoon of a spring day . The present . SCENE : The library of the old Dowd family mansion  --  a room lined with books and set with heavy , old-fashioned furniture of a faded grandeur . The most conspicuous item in the room is an oil painting over a black marble Victorian mantelpiece at the lower part of the wall at stage L. This is the portrait of a lantern-jawed older woman . There are double doors at R. These doors now pulled apart , lead to the hallway and across to the parlor , which is not seen . Telephone is on small table L.

VETA ( Into phone . ) Miss Myrtle Mae Simmons looked charming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the girdle with a touch of magenta on emerald . I wish you could see her , Miss Ellerbe . MYRTLE ( Crossing up R. Looks through door . ) Mother  --  please  --  she 's almost finished and where 's the cateress ? VETA ( To Myrtle . ) Everything 's ready . The minute she 's finished singing we open the dining-room doors and we begin pouring . ( Into phone . ) The parlors and halls are festooned with smilax . Yes , festooned . ( Makes motion in air with finger . ) That 's right . Yes , Miss Ellerbe , this is the first party we 've had in years . There 's a reason but I do n't want it in the papers . We all have our troubles , Miss Ellerbe . The guest list ? Oh , yes  --  p. 5 MYRTLE Mother  --  come . VETA If you 'll excuse me now , Miss Ellerbe . I 'll call you later . ( Hangs up . ) MYRTLE Mother  --  Mrs. Chauvenet just came in ! VETA ( Arranging flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her father was a scout with Buffalo Bill . MYRTLE So that 's where she got that hat ! VETA ( As she and MYRTLE start to exit . ) Myrtle , you must be nice to Mrs. Chauvenet . She has a grandson about your age . MYRTLE But what difference will it make , with Uncle Elwood ?  --  Mae ! VETA Myrtle  --  remember ! We agreed not to talk about that this afternoon . The point of this whole party is to get you started . We work through those older women to the younger group . MYRTLE We ca n't have anyone here in the evenings , and that 's when men come to see you  --  in the evenings . The only reason we can even have a party this afternoon is because Uncle Elwood is playing pinochle at the Fourth Avenue Firehouse . Thank God for the firehouse ! VETA I know  --  but they 'll just have to invite you out and it wo n't hurt them one bit . Oh , Myrtle  --  you 've got so much to offer . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet about every young girl .

That 's all there is to it . p. 6 MYRTLE If I do they say , That 's Myrtle Mae Simmons ! Her uncle is Elwood P. Dowd  --  the biggest screwball in town . Elwood P. Dowd and his pal  --  VETA ( Puts hand on her mouth . ) You promised . MYRTLE ( Crossing above table , sighs . ) All right  --  let 's get them into the dining-room . VETA Now when the members come in here and you make your little welcome speech on behalf of your grandmother  --  be sure to do this . ( Gestures toward portrait on mantel . ) MYRTLE ( In fine disgust  --  business with flowers . ) And then after that , I mention my Uncle Elwood and say a few words about his pal Harvey .

But how do you know Uncle Elwood wo n't come in and introduce Harvey to everybody ? ( To mantel . Places flowers on it. ) p. 7 VETA This is unkind of you , Myrtle Mae . Elwood is the biggest heartache I have . Even if people do call him peculiar he 's still my brother , and he wo n't be home this afternoon . MYRTLE Are you sure ? VETA Of course I 'm sure . MYRTLE But Mother , why ca n't we live like other people ? VETA Must I remind you again ? Elwood is not living with us  --  we are living with him . MYRTLE Living with him and Harvey ! Did Grandmother know about Harvey ? VETA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote me if she did . MYRTLE Why did she have to leave all her property to Uncle Elwood ? VETA Well , I suppose it was because she died in his arms . People are sentimental about things like that . MYRTLE You always say that and it does n't make sense . She could n't make out her will after she died , could she ? VETA Do n't be didactic , Myrtle Mae . It 's not becoming in a young girl , and men loathe it . Now do n't forget to wave your hand . MYRTLE I 'll do my best . ( Opens door. ) p. 8 VETA Oh , dear  --  Miss Tewksbury 's voice is certainly fading ! MYRTLE But not fast enough .

He is a man about 47 years old with a dignified bearing , and yet a dreamy expression in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the point of gravity . He wears an overcoat and a battered old hat . This hat , reminiscent of the Joe College era , sits on the top of his head . Over his arm he carries another hat and coat . As he enters , although he is alone , he seems to be ushering and bowing someone else in with him . He bows the invisible person over to a chair . His step is light , his movements quiet and his voice low-pitched . ) ELWOOD ( To invisible person . ) Excuse me a moment . I have to answer the phone . Make yourself comfortable , Harvey . ( Phone rings . ) Hello . Oh , you 've got the wrong number . But how are you , anyway ? This is Elwood P. Dowd speaking . I 'll do ? Well , thank you . And what is your name , my dear ?

CHAUVENET Oh , shame on him . That was the main reason I came . ( Takes off scarf  --  puts it on chair L. of table . ) I want to see Elwood . VETA Come  --  there are loads of people anxious to speak to you . MRS . CHAUVENET Do you realize , Veta , it 's been years since I 've seen Elwood ? VETA No  --  where does the time go ? MRS . CHAUVENET But I do n't understand it . I was saying to Mr. Chauvenet only the other night  --  what on earth do you suppose has happened to Elwood Dowd ? He never comes to the club dances any more . I have n't seen him at a horse show in years . Does Elwood see anybody these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glance at each other . ) Oh , yes  --  Aunt Ethel . Elwood sees somebody . MYRTLE Oh , yes . MRS .

ELWOOD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I would be delighted . VETA Elwood , there 's some mail for you today . I took it up to your room . p. 13 ELWOOD Did you , Veta ? That was nice of you . Aunt Ethel  --  I want you to meet Harvey . As you can see he 's a Pooka . ( Turns toward air beside him . ) Harvey , you 've heard me speak of Mrs. Chauvenet ? We always called her Aunt Ethel . She is one of my oldest and dearest friends . ( Inclines head toward space and goes " Hmm ! " and then listens as though not hearing first time . Nods as though having heard someone next to him speak . ) Yes  --  yes  --  that 's right . She 's the one . This is the one . ( To MRS . CHAUVENET . ) He says he would have known you anywhere . ( Then as a confused , bewildered look comes over MRS . CHAUVENET 'S face and as she looks to L. and R. of ELWOOD and cranes her neck to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crosses her towards VETA and MYRTLE MAE . ) You both look lovely . ( Turns to the air next to him . ) Come on in with me , Harvey  --  We must say hello to all of our friends  --   --  ( Bows to MRS . CHAUVENET . ) I beg your pardon , Aunt Ethel . If you 'll excuse me for one moment  --   --  ( Puts his hand gently on her arm , trying to turn her . ) MRS . CHAUVENET What ? p. 14 ELWOOD You are standing in his way  --   --  ( SHE gives a little  --  her eyes wide on him . ) Come along , Harvey . ( HE watches the invisible Harvey cross to door , then stops him . ) Uh-uh ! ( ELWOOD goes over to door . He turns and pantomimes as he arranges the tie and brushes off the head of the invisible Harvey . Then he does the same thing to his own tie . They are ALL watching him , MRS .

Then turns and comes back to MRS . CHAUVENET . ) Aunt Ethel , I can see you are disturbed about Harvey . Please do n't be . He stares like that at everybody . It 's his way . But he liked you . I could tell . He liked you very much . ( Pats her arm reassuringly , smiles at her , then calmly and confidently goes on out at R. After his exit  --  MRS . CHAUVENET , MYRTLE and VETA are silent . Finally VETA  --  with a resigned tone  --  clears her throat . ) VETA ( Looking at MRS . CHAUVENET . ) Some tea  --  perhaps  --  ? MRS . CHAUVENET Why , I  --  not right now  --  I  --  well  --  I think I 'll be running along .

Goodbye  --  goodbye  --   --  ( She exits quickly out L. VETA stands stiffly  --  her anger paralyzing her . MYRTLE finally tiptoes over and closes one side of door  --  peeking over , but keeping herself out of sight . ) MYRTLE Oh , God  --   --  ( Starts to run for doorway . ) Oh , my God ! VETA Myrtle  --  where are you going ? MYRTLE Up to my room . He 's introducing Harvey to everybody . I ca n't face those people now . I wish I were dead . VETA Come back here . Stay with me . We 'll get him out of there and upstairs to his room . MYRTLE I wo n't do it . I ca n't . I ca n't . VETA Myrtle Mae ! ( MYRTLE stops .

I 'm smiling  --   --  ( Waves off R. and laughs. ) and he 's my own brother ! MYRTLE Oh , Mother  --  people get run over by trucks every day . Why ca n't something like that happen to Uncle Elwood ? VETA Myrtle Mae Simmons , I 'm ashamed of you . This thing is not your uncle 's fault . ( Phone rings . ) MYRTLE Ouch ! You 're sticking me with that pin ! VETA That 's Miss Ellerbe . Keep looking . Keep smiling . ( She goes to phone . ) MYRTLE Mrs. Cummings is leaving . Uncle Elwood must have told her what Harvey is . Oh , God ! VETA ( On phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you come in the clothes you have on  --  What have you on ? Who is this ? But I do n't know any Miss Greenawalt . Should you what ?  --  May I ask who invited you ? Mr. Dowd ! Thank you just the same , but I believe there has been a mistake .  --  Well , I never ! p. 17 MYRTLE Never what ? VETA One of your Uncle Elwood 's friends . She asked me if she should bring a quart of gin to the Wednesday Forum ! MYRTLE There he is  --  he 's talking to Mrs. Halsey . VETA Is Harvey with him ? MYRTLE What a thing to ask ! How can I tell ? How can anybody tell but Uncle Elwood ? VETA ( Calls . ) Oh , Elwood , could I see you a moment , dear ? ( To Myrtle . ) I promise you your Uncle Elwood has disgraced us for the last time in this house . I 'm going to do something I 've never done before . MYRTLE What did you mean just now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If it 's not his fault , whose fault is it ? VETA Never you mind . I know whose fault it is . Now lift up your head and smile and go back in as though nothing had happened . MYRTLE You 're no match for Uncle Elwood . VETA You 'll see . ( ELWOOD is coming . ) MYRTLE ( As THEY pass at door . ) Mother 's waiting for you . ( She exits. ) p. 18 VETA Elwood ! Could I see you for a moment , dear ? ELWOOD Yes , sister . Excuse me , Harvey . ( VETA steps quickly over and pulls double doors together . ) VETA Elwood , would you mind sitting down in here and waiting for me until the party is over ? I wa n't to talk to you . It 's very important . ELWOOD ( Crossing C. ) Of course , sister . I happen to have a little free time right now and you 're welcome to all of it , Veta . ( Business . ) Do you want Harvey to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quite seriously  --  not in a pampering , humoring tone at all . ) Yes , Elwood . I certainly do . ( She steals out  --  watching him as she crosses through R. door . After she has gone out we see doors being pulled together from the outside and hear the click of a lock . ELWOOD goes calmly over to bookcase , peruses it carefully , and then when he had found the book he wants , takes it out and from behind it pulls a half-filled pint bottle of liquor . ) ELWOOD ( Looking at book he holds in one hand . ) Ah  --  Jane Austen . ( He gets one chair , pulls it down , facing front . Gets chair L. and pulls it right alongside . Sits down , sets bottle on floor between chairs . ) Sit down , Harvey . Veta wants to talk to us . She said it was important . I think she wants to congratulate us on the impression we made at her party . ( Reads . Turns to Harvey .

Inviting them to the house  --  playing cards with them  --  giving them food and money . And here I am trying to get Myrtle Mae started with a nice group of young people . If that is n't excess I 'm sure I do n't know what excess is . SANDERSON I did n't doubt your statement , Mrs. Simmons . I merely asked if your brother drinks .

Be honest , now  --  do n't you ? p. 27 SANDERSON I really could n't answer that question , because I  --   --  VETA I can . Yes  --  it certainly would have . SANDERSON This person you call Harvey  --  who is he ? VETA He 's a rabbit . SANDERSON Perhaps  --  but just who is he ? Some companion  --  someone your brother has picked up in these bars , of whom you disapprove ? VETA ( Patiently . ) Doctor  --  I 've been telling you . Harvey is a rabbit  --  a big white rabbit  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half ? Heavens knows I ought to know . He 's been around the house long enough . SANDERSON ( Regarding her narrowly . ) Now , Mrs. Simmons , let me understand this  --   --  you say  --   --  VETA ( Impatient . ) Doctor  --  do I have to keep repeating myself ? My brother insists that his closest friend is this big white rabbit . This rabbit is named Harvey . Harvey lives at our house . Do n't you understand ? He and Elwood go every place together . Elwood buys railroad tickets , theater tickets , for both of them . As I told Myrtle Mae  --  if your uncle was so lonesome he had to bring something home  --  why could n't he bring home something human ? He has me , does n't he ? He has Myrtle Mae , does n't he ? ( She leans forward . ) Doctor  --  ( She rises to him . HE inclines toward her . ) I 'm going to tell you something I 've never told anybody in the world before . ( Puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while I see that big white rabbit myself . Now is n't that terrible ? I 've never even told that to Myrtle Mae. p. 28 SANDERSON ( Now convinced . Starts to rise . ) Mrs. Simmons  --  VETA ( Straightening . ) And what 's more  --  he 's every bit as big as Elwood says he is . Now do n't ever tell that to anybody , Doctor . I 'm ashamed of it . ( Crosses to C. , to chair R. of desk . ) SANDERSON ( Crosses to VETA . ) I can see that you have been under a great nervous strain recently . VETA Well  --  I certainly have . SANDERSON Grief over your mother 's death depressed you considerably ? VETA ( Sits chair R. of desk . ) Nobody knows how much . SANDERSON Been losing sleep ? VETA How could anybody sleep with that going on ? SANDERSON ( Crosses to back of desk . ) Short-tempered over trifles ? VETA You just try living with those two and see how your temper holds up . SANDERSON ( Presses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one could eat at a table with my brother and a big white rabbit . Well , I 'm finished with it . I 'll sell the house  --  be appointed conservator of Elwood 's estate , and Myrtle Mae and I will be able to entertain our friends in peace . It 's too much , Doctor . I just ca n't stand it . SANDERSON ( Has been repeatedly pressing a buzzer on his desk . He looks with annoyance toward hall door . His answer now to VETA is gentle . ) Of course , Mrs. Simmons . Of course it is You 're tired . VETA ( She nods . ) Oh , yes I am . SANDERSON You 've been worrying a great deal . VETA ( Nods . ) Yes , I have , I ca n't help it . SANDERSON And now I 'm going to help you . VETA Oh , Doctor . SANDERSON ( Goes cautiously to door  --  watching her . ) Just sit there quietly , Mrs. Simmons . I 'll be right back . ( He exits C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out as she takes coat . ) I 'll just go down to the cab and get Elwood 's things . ( She exits out down L. SANDERSON , KELLY and WILSON come from C. ) p. 30 SANDERSON Why did n't someone answer the buzzer ? KELLY I did n't hear you , Doctor  --   --  SANDERSON I rang and rang . ( Looks into his office . It is empty . ) Mrs. Simmons  --  ( Looks out door L. , shuts it , comes back . ) Sound the gong , Wilson . That poor woman must not leave the grounds . WILSON She 's made with a getaway , huh , doc ? ( WILSON presses a button on the wall and we hear a loud gong sounding . ) SANDERSON Her condition is serious . Go after her . ( WILSON exits C. ) KELLY I ca n't believe it . ( Above chair R. of desk . ) SANDERSON sits L. of desk and picks up phone . ) SANDERSON Main gate . Henry , Dr. Sanderson . Allow no one out of the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hangs up . ) I should n't have left her alone , but no one answered the buzzer . KELLY Wilson was in South , Doctor . SANDERSON ( Making out papers . ) What have we available , Miss Kelly ? p. 31 KELLY Number 13 , upper West R. , is ready , Doctor . SANDERSON Have her taken there immediately , and I will prescribe preliminary treatment . I must contact her brother . Dowd is the name . Elwood P. Dowd . Get him on the telephone for me , will you please , Miss Kelly ? KELLY But Doctor  --  I did n't know it was the woman who needed the treatment . She said it was for her brother . SANDERSON Of course she did . It 's the oldest dodge in the world  --  always used by a cunning type of psychopath . She apparently knew her brother was about to commit her , so she came out to discredit him . Get him on the telephone , please . KELLY But , Doctor  --  I thought the woman was all right , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Wing G. He 's there now . SANDERSON ( Staring at her with horror . ) You had Wilson take the brother in ? No gags , please Kelly . You 're not serious , are you ? KELLY Oh , I did , Doctor . I did . Oh , Doctor , I 'm terribly sorry . SANDERSON Oh , well then , if you 're sorry , that fixes everything . ( He starts to pick up house phone and finishes the curse under his breath . ) Oh  --  no ! ( Buries his head in his hands. ) p. 32 KELLY I 'll do it , Doctor . I 'll do it . ( She takes phone . ) Miss Dunphy  --  will you please unlock the door to Number 24  --  and give Mr. Dowd his clothes and  --   --  ? ( Looks at Sanderson for direction . ) SANDERSON Ask him to step down to the office right away . KELLY ( Into phone . ) Ask him to step down to the office right away . There 's been a terrible mistake and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table to C. ) Explain ? Apologize ! KELLY ( Hanging up . ) Thank heaven they had n't put him in a hydro tub yet . She 'll let him out . SANDERSON ( Staring at her . ) Beautiful  --  and dumb , too . It 's almost too good to be true . KELLY ( Crosses to L. of Sanderson . ) Doctor  --  I feel terrible . I did n't know . Judge Gaffney called and said Mrs. Simmons and her brother would be out here , and when she came in here  --  you do n't have to be sarcastic . SANDERSON Oh , do n't I ? Stop worrying . We 'll squirm out of it some way . ( Thinking  --  starts toward R. ) p. 33 KELLY Where are you going ? SANDERSON I 've got to tell the chief about it , Kelly . He may want to handle this himself . KELLY He 'll be furious . I know he will . He 'll die . And then he 'll terminate me . SANDERSON ( Below table , catches her shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KELLY Oh , no  --  tell him it was all my fault , Doctor . SANDERSON I never mention your name . ( Crossing to door R. ) Except in my sleep . KELLY But this man Dowd  --   --  ( Kneels on chair R. ) SANDERSON Do n't let him get away . I 'll be right back . KELLY ( Crosses to L. of chair R. of table . ) But what shall I say to him ? What shall I do ? He 'll be furious . SANDERSON Look , Kelly  --  he 'll probably be fit to be tied  --  but he 's a man , is n't he ? KELLY I guess so  --  his name is Mister . ( Off chair . ) SANDERSON ( Across chair from her . ) Go into your old routine  --  you know  --  the eyes  --  the swish  --  the works . I 'm immune  --  but I 've seen it work with some people  --  some of the patients out here . Keep him here , Kelly  --  if you have to do a strip tease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry . Speaks to closed door . ) Well , of all the  --  oh  --  you 're wonderful , Dr. Sanderson ! You 're just about the most wonderful person I ever met in my life . ( Kicks chair . ) WILSON ( Has entered from C. in time to hear last sentence . ) Yeah  --  but how about giving me a lift here just the same ? KELLY What ? WILSON That Simmons dame . KELLY ( Crosses to Wilson . ) Did you catch her ? WILSON Slick as a whistle . She was comin ' along the path hummin ' a little tune . I jumped out at her from behind a tree . I says " Sister  --  there 's a man wants to see you . " Shoulda heard her yell ! She 's whacky , all right . KELLY Take her to No. 13 upper West R. ( Crosses WILSON to back of desk . ) WILSON She 's there now . Brought her in through the diet kitchen . She 's screamin ' and kickin ' like hell . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KELLY Just a second , Wilson , Dr. Sanderson told me to stay here till her brother comes down  --  ( Round back of desk. ) p. 35 WILSON Make it snappy  --  ( Goes out C. ELWOOD enters C. KELLY rises . ) KELLY You 're Mr. Dowd ? ELWOOD ( Carrying other hat and coat over his arm . He bows . ) Elwood P. KELLY I 'm Miss Kelly . ELWOOD Let me give you one of my cards . ( Fishes in vest pocket  --  pulls out card . ) If you should want to call me  --  call me at this number . Do n't call me at that one . That 's the old one . KELLY Thank you . ELWOOD Perfectly all right , and if you lose it  --  do n't worry , my dear . I have plenty more . KELLY Wo n't you have a chair , please , Mr. Dowd ? ELWOOD Thank you . I 'll have two . Allow me . ( He brings another chair down from U.C. to L. of chair L. of table . Puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit in chair L. of table . He stands waiting . ) KELLY Dr. Sanderson is very anxious to talk to you . He 'll be here in a minute . Please be seated . p. 36 ELWOOD ( Waving her toward chair R. of desk . ) After you , my dear . KELLY Oh , I really ca n't , thank you . I 'm in and out all the time . But you must n't mind me . Please sit down . ELWOOD ( Bowing . ) After you . KELLY ( She sits chair R. of desk . He sits on chair he has just put in place . ) Could I get you a magazine to look at ? ELWOOD I would much rather look at you , Miss Kelly , if you do n't mind . You really are very lovely . KELLY Oh  --  well . Thank you . Some people do n't seem to think so . ELWOOD Some people are blind . That is often brought to my attention . And now , Miss Kelly  --  I would like to have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and backs up to below desk . ELWOOD rises when she does , and he makes a motion to the invisible Harvey to rise , too . ) SANDERSON ( Going to him , extending hand . ) Mr. Dowd ? ELWOOD Elwood P. Let me give you one of my cards . If you should want  --  p. 37 SANDERSON ( Crossing to C. ) Mr. Dowd  --  I am Dr. Lyman Sanderson , Dr. Chumley 's assistant out here . ELWOOD Well , good for you ! I 'm happy to know you . How are you , Doctor ? SANDERSON That 's going to depend on you , I 'm afraid . Please sit down . You 've met Miss Kelly , Mr. Dowd ? ELWOOD I have had that pleasure , and I want both of you to meet a very dear friend of mine  --  SANDERSON Later on  --  be glad to . Wo n't you be seated , because first I want to say  --  ELWOOD After Miss Kelly  --  SANDERSON Sit down , Kelly  --  ( SHE sits L. of desk , as does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Is that chair quite comfortable , Mr. Dowd ? ELWOOD Yes , thank you . Would you care to try it ? ( He takes out a cigarette . ) SANDERSON No , thank you . How about an ash tray there ? Could we give Mr. Dowd an ash tray ? ( KELLY gets up  --  gets it from wall L. ELWOOD and Harvey rise also . ELWOOD beams as he turns and watches her . KELLY puts ash tray by DOWD , who moves it to share with Harvey . ) Is it too warm in here for you , Mr. Dowd ? Would you like me to open a window ? ( ELWOOD has n't heard . He is watching Miss Kelly. ) p. 38 KELLY ( Turning , smiling at him . ) Mr. Dowd  --  Dr. Sanderson wants to know if he should open a window ? ELWOOD That 's entirely up to him . I would n't presume to live his life for him . ( During this dialogue SANDERSON is near window . KELLY has her eyes on his face . ELWOOD smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) SANDERSON Now then , Mr. Dowd , I can see that you 're not the type of person to be taken in by any high-flown phrases or beating about the bush . ( Sits on lower R. Corner of desk . ) ELWOOD ( Politely . ) Is that so , Doctor ? SANDERSON You have us at a disadvantage here . You know it . We know it . Let 's lay the cards on the table . ELWOOD That certainly appeals to me , Doctor . SANDERSON Best way in the long run . People are people , no matter where you go . ELWOOD That is very often the case . SANDERSON And being human are therefore liable to mistakes . Miss Kelly and I have made a mistake here this afternoon , Mr. Dowd , and we 'd like to explain it to you . p. 39 KELLY It was n't Doctor Sanderson 's fault , Mr. Dowd . It was mine . SANDERSON A human failing  --  as I said . ELWOOD I find it very interesting , nevertheless . You and Miss Kelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say ? ( THEY nod . ELWOOD gives Harvey a knowing look . ) KELLY We do hope you 'll understand , Mr. Dowd . ELWOOD Oh , yes . Yes . These things are often the basis of a long and warm friendship . SANDERSON And the responsibility is , of course , not hers  --  but mine . ELWOOD Your attitude may be old-fashioned , Doctor  --  but I like it . SANDERSON Now , if I had seen your sister first  --  that would have been an entirely different story . ELWOOD Now there you surprise me . I think the world and all of Veta  --  but I had supposed she had seen her day . ( KELLY sits chair R. of desk . ) SANDERSON You must not attach any blame to her . She is a very sick woman . Came in here insisting you were in need of treatment . That 's perfectly ridiculous . p. 40 ELWOOD Veta should n't be upset about me . I get along fine . SANDERSON Exactly  --  but your sister had already talked to Miss Kelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer , Judge Gaffney  --  ELWOOD Oh , yes , I know him . Know his wife , too . Nice people . ( He turns to Harvey  --  cigarette business : he needs a match . ) SANDERSON Is there something I can get for you , Mr. Dowd ? ELWOOD What did you have in mind ? SANDERSON A light  --  here  --  let me give you a light . ( Crosses to DOWD , lights his cigarette . ELWOOD brushes smoke away from the rabbit . ) Your sister was extremely nervous and plunged right away into a heated tirade on your drinking . ( Crosses back to sit on chair R. of desk . ) ELWOOD That was Veta . SANDERSON She became hysterical . ELWOOD I tell Veta not to worry about that . I 'll take care of that . SANDERSON Exactly . Oh , I suppose you take a drink now and then  --  the same as the rest of us ? p. 41 ELWOOD Yes , I do . As a matter of fact , I would like one right now . SANDERSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister 's reaction to the whole matter of drinking was entirely too intense . Does your sister drink , Mr. Dowd ? ELWOOD Oh , no , Doctor . No . I do n't believe Veta has ever taken a drink . SANDERSON Well , I 'm going to surprise you . I think she has and does  --  constantly . ELWOOD I am certainly surprised . SANDERSON But it 's not her alcoholism that 's going to be the basis for my diagnosis of her case . It 's much more serious than that . It was when she began talking so emotionally about this big white rabbit  --  Harvey  --  yes , I believe she called him Harvey  --  ELWOOD ( Nodding . ) Harvey is his name . SANDERSON She claimed you were persecuting her with this Harvey . ELWOOD I have n't been persecuting her with Harvey . Veta should n't feel that way . And now , Doctor , before we go any further I must insist you let me introduce  --  ( He starts to rise . ) SANDERSON Let me make my point first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't spring up overnight . Her condition stems from trauma . p. 42 ELWOOD ( Sits down again . ) From what ? SANDERSON From trauma .  --  Spelled T-R-A-U-M-A . It means shock . Nothing unusual about it . There is the birth trauma . The shock to the act of being born . ELWOOD ( Nodding . ) That 's the one we never get over  --  SANDERSON You have a nice sense of humor , Dowd  --  has n't he , Miss Kelly ? KELLY Oh , yes , Doctor . ELWOOD May I say the same about both of you ? SANDERSON To sum it all up  --  your sister 's condition is serious , but I can help her . She must however remain out here temporarily . ELWOOD I 've always wanted Veta to have everything she needs . SANDERSON Exactly . ELWOOD But I would n't want Veta to stay out here unless she liked it out here and wanted to stay here . SANDERSON Of course . ( To Kelly . ) Did Wilson get what he went after ? ( KELLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rises. ) p. 43 SANDERSON What was Mrs. Simmons ' attitude , Miss Kelly ? KELLY ( Crosses above desk to file cabinet R. ) Not unusual , Doctor . SANDERSON ( Rising . ) Mr. Dowd , if this were an ordinary delusion  --  something reflected on the memory picture  --  in other words , if she were seeing something she had seen once  --  that would be one thing . But this is more serious . It stands to reason nobody has ever seen a white rabbit six feet high . ELWOOD ( Smiles at Harvey . ) Not very often , Doctor . SANDERSON I like you , Dowd . ELWOOD I like you , too , Doctor . And Miss Kelly here . ( Looks for MISS KELLY , who is just crossing in front of window seat . ELWOOD springs to his feet . KELLY sits quickly . ELWOOD motions Harvey down and sits , himself . ) I like her , too . SANDERSON So she must be committed here temporarily . Under these circumstances I would commit my own grandmother . ( Goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too ? SANDERSON It 's just an expression . ( Leans over desk . ) Now will you sign these temporary commitment papers as next- of-kin  --  just a formality ? p. 44 ELWOOD ( Rises , crosses to R. of desk . ) You 'd better have Veta do that , Doctor . She always does all the signing and managing for the family . She 's good at it . ( Pushes chair R. of desk under desk . ) SANDERSON We ca n't disturb her now . ( Sits L. of desk . ) ELWOOD Perhaps I 'd better talk it over with Judge Gaffney ? SANDERSON You can explain it all to him later . Tell him I advised it . And it is n't as if you could n't drop in here any time and make inquiries . Glad to have you . I 'll make out a full visitor 's pass for you . When would you like to come back ? Wednesday , say ? Friday , say ? ELWOOD You and Miss Kelly have been so pleasant I can come back right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aback . ) Well  --  we 're pretty busy around here , but I guess that 's all right . ELWOOD I do n't really have to go now . I 'm not very hungry . SANDERSON Delighted to have you stay  --  but Miss Kelly and I have to get on upstairs now . Plenty of work to do . But I tell you what you might like to do . p. 45 ELWOOD What might I like to do ? SANDERSON We do n't usually do this  --  but just to make sure in your mind that your sister is in good hands  --  why do n't you look around here ? If you go through that door  --  ( Rises  --  points beyond stairway. ) and turn right just beyond the stairway you 'll find the occupational therapy room down the hall , and beyond that the conservatory , the library and the diet kitchen . ELWOOD For Veta 's sake I believe I 'd better do that , Doctor . SANDERSON Very well , then . ( He is now anxious to terminate the interview . Rises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure to have this little talk with you , Mr. Dowd . ( Gives him pass . ) ELWOOD ( Walking toward her . ) I 've enjoyed it too , Doctor  --  meeting you and Miss Kelly . SANDERSON And I will say that for a layman you show an unusually acute perception into psychiatric problems . ELWOOD Is that a fact ? I never thought I knew anything about it . Nobody does , do you think ? SANDERSON Well  --  the good psychiatrist is not found under every bush . p. 46 ELWOOD You have to pick the right bush . Since we all seem to have enjoyed this so much , let us keep right on . I would like to invite you to come with me now down to Charlie 's Place and have a drink . When I enjoy people I like to stay right with them . SANDERSON Sorry  --  we 're on duty now . Give us a rain-check . Some other time be glad to . ELWOOD When ? SANDERSON Oh  --  ca n't say right now . Miss Kelly and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ELWOOD Let us go to Charlie 's at ten o'clock tonight . SANDERSON Well  --  ELWOOD And you , Miss Kelly ? KELLY I  --  ( Looks at Sanderson . ) SANDERSON Dr. Chumley does n't approve of members of the staff fraternizing , but since you 've been so understanding perhaps we could manage it . ELWOOD I 'll pick you up out here in a cab at ten o'clock tonight and the four of us will spend a happy evening . I want you both to become friends with a very dear friend of mine . You said later on  --  so later on it will be . Goodbye , now . ( Motions goodbye to Harvey . Tips hat , exits C. ) p. 47 KELLY ( Places chair and ash tray against back wall . ) Whew  --  now I can breathe again ! SANDERSON Boy , that was a close shave all right , but he seemed to be a pretty reasonable sort of fellow . That man is proud  --  what he has to be proud of I do n't know . I played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody if you want to . Now I must look in on that Simmons woman . ( Crosses below desk toward C. ) KELLY ( At R. C. ) Dr. Sanderson  --  ! ( SANDERSON turns . ) You say you can get to anybody if you want to . How can you do that ? SANDERSON . Takes study , Kelly . Years of specialized training . There 's only one thing I do n't like about this Dowd business . KELLY What 's that ? SANDERSON Having to make that date with him . Of course the man has left here as a good friend and booster of this sanitarium  --  so I guess I 'll have to go with him tonight  --  but you do n't have to go . KELLY Oh ! ( Back of chair L. of table . ) SANDERSON No point in it . I 'll have a drink with him , pat him on the back and leave . I 've got a date tonight , anyway . p. 48 KELLY ( Freezing . ) Oh , yes  --  by all means . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea bored me stiff . I would n't go if I never went anywhere again . I would n't go if my life depended on it . SANDERSON ( Stepping back to her . ) What 's the matter with you , Kelly ? What are you getting so emotional about ? KELLY He may be a peculiar man with funny clothes , but he knows how to act . His manners were perfect . SANDERSON I saw you giving him the doll-puss stare . I did n't miss that . KELLY He would n't sit down till I sat down . He told me I was lovely and he called me dear . I 'd go to have a drink with him if you were n't going . SANDERSON Sure you would . And look at him ! All he does is hang around bars . He does n't work . All that corny bowing and getting up out of his chair every time a woman makes a move . Why , he 's as outdated as a cast-iron deer . But you 'd sit with him in a bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful girl , Kelly . KELLY Now let me tell you something  --  you  --  ( Enter from down R. the great DR . WILLIAM CHUMLEY . DR . CHUMLEY is a large , handsome man of about 57 . He has gray hair and wears rimless glasses which he removes now and then to tap on his hand for emphasis . He is smartly dressed . His manner is confident , pompous and lordly . He is good and he knows it ) . p. 49 CHUMLEY ( Enters with book . ) Dr. Sanderson ! Miss Kelly ! ( THEY break apart and jump to attention like two buck privates before a C.O. ) KELLY AND SANDERSON Yes , Doctor ? CHUMLEY Tell the gardener to prune more carefully around my prize dahlias along the fence by the main road . They 'll be ready for cutting next week . ( At upper corner of book-case . ) The difficulty of the woman who has the big white rabbit  --  has it been smoothed over ? SANDERSON Yes , Doctor . I spoke to her brother and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out here who saw animals , I have never before had a patient with an animal that large . ( Puts book in book-case . ) SANDERSON Yet , Doctor . She called him Harvey . CHUMLEY Harvey . Unusual name for an animal of any kind . Harvey is a man 's name . I have known several men in my day named Harvey , but I have never heard of any type of animal whatsoever with that name . The case has an interesting phase , Doctor . ( Finishes straightening books . ) SANDERSON Yes , Doctor . p. 50 CHUMLEY I will now go upstairs with you and look in on this woman . It may be that we can use my formula 977 on her . I will give you my advice in prescribing the treatment , Doctor . ( Crosses to below table . ) SANDERSON Thank you , Doctor . CHUMLEY ( Starts to move across stage toward C. and stops , draws himself up sternly . ) And now  --  may I ask  --  what is that hat and coat doing on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . Do you know , Miss Kelly ? Was it Dowd 's ? KELLY ( Above table , picking up hat and coat . ) He had his hat on , Doctor . Perhaps it belongs to a relative of one of the patients . CHUMLEY ( Crosses to C. ) Hand me the hat . ( KELLY hands it . Looking inside : ) There may be some kind of identification  --  Here  --  what 's this  --  what 's this ? ( Pushes two fingers up through the holes . ) Two holes cut in the crown of this hat . See ! KELLY That 's strange ! CHUMLEY Some new fad  --  put them away . Hang them up  --  get them out of here . ( KELLY takes them into upper L. office . CHUMLEY starts crossing to table . KELLY has come out of L. WILSON comes in through C. ) p. 51 WILSON ( Very impressed with Dr. Chumley and very fond of him . ) Hello , Dr. Chumley . CHUMLEY Oh , there you are . WILSON How is every little old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes from R. of desk ; R. of table , looking at notes . KELLY re-enters from upper left . ) CHUMLEY Fair , thank you , Wilson , fair . WILSON ( Top of desk . ) Look  --  somebody 's gon na have to give me a hand with this Simmons dame  --  order a restraining jacket or something . She 's terrible . ( To Kelly . ) Forgot me , did n't you ? Well , I got her corset off all by myself . CHUMLEY We 're going up to see this patient right now , Wilson . WILSON She 's in a hydro tub now  --  my God  --  I left the water running on her ! ( Runs off C. upstairs , followed by KELLY . ) ( BETTY CHUMLEY , the Doctor 's wife , enters down L. She is a good-natured , gay , bustling woman of about 55 . ) BETTY Willie  --  remember your promise  --  . Hello , Dr. Sanderson . Willie , you have n't forgotten Dr. McClure 's cocktail party ? We promised them faithfully . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right . I have to go upstairs now and look in on a patient . Be down shortly  --  ( Exits C. upstairs . ) BETTY ( Calling after him ; as she crosses down to chair L. of table , she sits , fixes her shoe . ) Give a little quick diagnosis , Willie  --  we do n't want to be late to the party . I 'm dying to see the inside of that house . ( Enter ELWOOD from C. He does n't see Betty at first . He looks around the room carefully . ) Good evening . ELWOOD ( Removing his hat and bowing . ) Good evening . ( Puts hat on desk . Walks over to her . ) BETTY I am Mrs. Chumley . Doctor Chumley 's wife . ELWOOD I 'm happy to know that . Dowd is my name . Elwood P. Let me give you one of my cards . ( Gives her one . ) If you should want to call me  --  call me at this one . Do n't call me at that one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old one . ( Starts one step . Looking . ) BETTY Thank you . Is there something I can do for you ? ELWOOD ( Turns to her . ) What did you have in mind ? p. 53 BETTY You seem to be looking for someone . ELWOOD ( Walking . ) Yes , I am . I 'm looking for Harvey . I went off without him . BETTY Harvey ? Is he a patient here ? ELWOOD ( Turns . ) Oh , no . Nothing like that . ( Cross to door down L. ) BETTY Does he work here ? ELWOOD ( Looking out down L. door . ) Oh no . He is what you might call my best friend . He is also a pooka . He came out here with me and Veta this afternoon . BETTY Where was he when you last saw him ? ELWOOD ( Behind chair L. of desk . ) In that chair there  --  with his hat and coat on the table . BETTY There does n't seem to be any hat and coat around here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't see him anywhere . ( Looks in SANDERSON 'S office . ) BETTY What was that word you just said  --  pooka ? ELWOOD ( Crosses C. He is looking in hallway C. ) Yes  --  that 's it . p. 54 BETTY Is that something new ? ( Looks in hallway . ) ELWOOD ( Coming down . ) Oh , no . As I understand it . That 's something very old . BETTY Oh , really ? I had never happened to hear it before . ELWOOD I 'm not too surprised at that . I had n't myself , until I met him . I do hope you get an opportunity to meet him . I 'm sure he would be quite taken with you . ( Down C. on a line with Betty . ) BETTY Oh , really ? Well , that 's very nice of you to say so , I 'm sure . ELWOOD Not at all . If Harvey happens to take a liking to people he expresses himself quite definitely . If he 's not particularly interested , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor . Harvey takes his time making his mind up about people . Choosey , you see . ( Crosses above table to door R. ) BETTY That 's not such a bad way to be in this day and age . ELWOOD Harvey is fond of my sister , Veta . That 's because he is fond of me , and Veta and I come from the same family . Now you 'd think that feeling would be mutual , would n't you ? ( Looks in office R. Crosses to chair R. of table . ) But Veta does n't seem to care for Harvey . Do n't you think that 's rather too bad , Mrs. Chumley ? p. 55 BETTY Oh , I do n't know , Mr. Dowd . I gave up a long time ago expecting my family to like my friends . It 's useless . ELWOOD But we must keep on trying . ( Sits chair R. of table . ) BETTY Well , there 's no harm in trying , I suppose . ELWOOD Because if Harvey has said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Dowd , I would do anything for you . " Mrs. Chumley  --  BETTY Yes  --  ELWOOD Did you know that Mrs. McElinney 's Aunt Rose is going to drop in on her unexpectedly tonight from Cleveland ? BETTY Why , no I did n't  --  ELWOOD Neither does she . That puts you both in the same boat , does n't it ? BETTY Well , I do n't know anybody named  --  Mrs.  --   --  ELWOOD Mrs. McElhinney ? Lives next door to us . She is a wonderful woman . Harvey told me about her Aunt Rose . That 's an interesting little news item , and you are perfectly free to pass it around . BETTY Well , I  --   --  ELWOOD Would you care to come downtown with me now , my dear ? I would be glad to buy you a drink . p. 56 BETTY Thank you very much , but I am waiting for Dr. Chumley and if he came down and found me gone he would be liable to raise  --  he would be irritated ! ELWOOD We would n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( He rises . ) BETTY I 'll tell you what I 'll do , however . ELWOOD What will you do , however ? I 'm interested . BETTY If your friend comes in while I 'm here I 'd be glad to give him a message for you . ELWOOD ( Gratefully . ) Would you do that ? I 'd certainly appreciate that . ( Goes up C. to top of desk for his hat . ) BETTY No trouble at all . I 'll write it down on the back of this . ( Holds up card . Takes pencil from purse . ) What would you like me to tell him if he comes in while I 'm still here ? ELWOOD Ask him to meet me downtown  --  if he has no other plans . BETTY ( Writing . ) Meet Mr. Dowd downtown . Any particular place down-town ? ELWOOD He knows where . Harvey knows this town like a book . p. 57 BETTY ( Writing . ) Harvey  --  you know where . Harvey what ? ELWOOD Just Harvey . BETTY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you what . ELWOOD What ? BETTY ( Swings chair R. of desk in position . ) Doctor and I are going right down-town  --  to 12th and Moneview . Dr. McClure is having a cocktail party . ELWOOD ( At L. of desk ; he writes that down on pad on desk . ) A cocktail party at 12th and Montview . BETTY We 're driving there in a few minutes . We could give your friend a lift into town . ELWOOD I hate to impose on you  --  but I would certainly appreciate that . BETTY No trouble at all . Dr. McClure is having this party for his sister from Wichita . ELWOOD I did n't know Dr. McClure had a sister in Wichita . BETTY Oh  --  you know Dr. McClure ? ELWOOD No . BETTY ( Puts Elwood 's card down on desk . ) But  --   --  ( Sits chair R. of desk. ) p. 58 ELWOOD You 're quite sure you have n't time to come into town with me and have a drink ? BETTY I really could n't  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps ? BETTY Thank you . ELWOOD It 's been very pleasant to meet you , and I hope to see you again . BETTY Yes , so do I. ELWOOD Goodnight , my dear . ( Tips hat  --  bows  --  goes to door , turns . ) You ca n't miss Harvey . He 's very tall  --  ( Shows with hands . ) Like that  --  ( Exits down L.

Dowd . KELLY enters from R. to below table  --  she has Dr. Chumley 's hat . ) SANDERSON That 's Mrs. Simmons ' brother , Doctor . I told him he could look around , and I gave him full visiting privileges . CHUMLEY She must n't see anyone tonight . Not anyone at all . Tell him that . SANDERSON Yes , Doctor . BETTY He did n't ask to see her ? He was looking for someone  --  some friend of his . CHUMLEY Who could that be , Dr. Sanderson ? SANDERSON I do n't know , Doctor . BETTY He said it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 SANDERSON Was there anyone with Dowd when you saw him , Miss Kelly ? KELLY ( R. C. giving hat to SANDERSON . ) No , Doctor  --  not when I saw him . BETTY Well , he said there was . He said he last saw his friend sitting right in that chair there with his hat and coat . He seemed quite disappointed . KELLY ( At top of table  --  a funny look is crossing her face . ) Dr. Sanderson  --  BETTY I told him if we located his friend we 'd give him a lift into town . He could ride in the back seat . Was that all right , Willie ? CHUMLEY Of course  --  of course  --  BETTY Oh here it is . I wrote it down on the back of this card . His friend 's name was Harvey . KELLY Harvey ! BETTY He did n't give me his last name . He mentioned something else about him  --  pooka  --  but I did n't quite get what that was . SANDERSON AND CHUMLEY Harvey ! BETTY ( Rises . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , why are you looking like that , Willie ? This man was a very nice , polite man , and he merely asked that we give his friend a lift into town , and if we ca n't do a favor for someone , why are we living ?

By George , we 'll find out about this ! ( KELLY goes out upper L. to get it . BETTY crosses R. to chair R. of table . CHUMLEY and SANDERSON sit at R. of desk . ) BETTY I do n't know where he went .

How is that name spelled ? With a W , not a U  --  Mr. Elwood P. Dowd . Thank you , Judge  --  ( Hangs up  --  rises  --  pushes chair in to desk  --  takes hat from KELLY .

You went to medical school  --  you specialized in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth . ( Holds up hat and runs two fingers up through holes in it . ) Perhaps they neglected to tell you that a rabbit has large pointed ears ! That a hat for a rabbit would have to be perforated to make room for those ears ? SANDERSON Dowd seemed reasonable enough this afternoon , Doctor . CHUMLEY Doctor  --  the function of a psychiatrist is to tell the difference between those who are reasonable , and those who merely talk and act reasonably . ( Presses buzzer , Flings hat on desk . ) Do you realize what you have done to me ? You do n't answer . I 'll tell you . You have permitted a psycopathic case to walk off these grounds and roam around with an overgrown white rabbit . You have subjected me  --  a psychiatrist  --  to the humiliation of having to call  --  of all things  --  a lawyer to find out who came out here to be committed  --  and who came out here to commit !

Go right up . I 'll be with you in a minute . ( Crosses to chair L. of table . JUDGE OMAR GAFFNEY enters R. , an elderly white-haired man .

JUDGE I mean your mother . Where 's Veta Louise ? ( Crosses in front of chair . ) MYRTLE Why Judge Gaffney ! You know where she is . She took Uncle Elwood out to the sanitarium . JUDGE I know that . But why was I called at the club with a lot of hysteria ? Could n't even get what she was talking about . Carrying on something fierce . ( Sits chair R. of table R. ) p. 66 MYRTLE Mother carrying on ! What about ? ( Crosses down to chair L. of table R. ) JUDGE I do n't know . She was hysterical . MYRTLE That 's strange !

Turns to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What are you talking about ? MYRTLE When Mother left the house with Uncle Elwood I went over to the real estate office to put the house on the market . And what do you think I found there ? ( She sits . ) JUDGE I 'm not a quiz kid . MYRTLE Well , I found a man there who was looking for an old house just like this to cut up into buffet apartments . He 's going through it now . JUDGE Now see here , Myrtle Mae . This house does n't belong to you . It belongs to your Uncle Elwood . MYRTLE But now that Elwood is locked up . Mother controls the property , does n't she ? JUDGE Where is your mother ? Where is Veta Louise ? p. 67 MYRTLE Judge , she went out to Chumley 's Rest to tell them about Harvey and put Uncle Elwood in . JUDGE Why did she call me at the club when I was in the middle of a game , and scream at me to meet her here about something important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . Have you got the deed to this house ? JUDGE Certainly , it 's in my safe . Myrtle , I feel pretty bad about this thing of locking Elwood up . MYRTLE Mother and I will be able to take a long trip now  --  out to Pasadena . JUDGE I always liked that boy . He could have done anything  --  been anything  --  made a place for himself in this community . MYRTLE And all he did was get a big rabbit . JUDGE He had everything . Brains , personality , friends . Men liked him . Women liked him . I liked him . MYRTLE Are you telling me that once Uncle Elwood was like other men  --  that women actually liked him  --  I mean in that way ? JUDGE Oh , not since he started running around with this big rabbit . But they did once . Once that mail-box of your grandmother 's was full of those little blue-scented envelopes for Elwood. p. 68 MYRTLE I ca n't believe it . JUDGE Of course there was always something different about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes  --  he was always so calm about any sudden change in plans . I used to admire it . I should have been suspicious .

MYRTLE You do n't dream how far overboard he 's gone on this rabbit . JUDGE Oh , yes I do . He 's had that rabbit in my office many 's the time . I 'm old but I do n't miss much .

JUDGE Steady  --  steady , girl , steady . VETA Please  --  not so fast . JUDGE Do n't rush her , Myrtle  --  Ease her in . VETA Let me sit down . Only get me some place where I can sit down .

MYRTLE Let her get her breath , Judge . VETA Let me sit here a minute and then let me get upstairs to my own bed where I can let go . MYRTLE What happened to you , Mother ? VETA Omar , I want you to sue them . They put me in and let Elwood out . JUDGE What 's this ? MYRTLE Mother ! VETA ( Taking off hat . ) Just look at my hair . MYRTLE But why ? What did you say ? What did you do ? ( Kneels at VETA 'S feet . ) You must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I simply told them about Elwood and Harvey . JUDGE Then how could it happen to you ? I do n't understand it . ( Sits chair R. ) VETA I told them about Elwood , and then I went down to the cab to get his things . As I was walking along the path  --  this awful man stepped out . He was a white slaver . I know he was . He had on one of those white suits . That 's how they advertise . p. 71 MYRTLE A man  --  what did he do , Mother ? VETA What did he do ? He took hold of me and took me in there and then he  --   --  ( Bows her head , MYRTLE and JUDGE exchange a look . ) JUDGE ( Softly . ) Go on , Veta Louise . Go on , girl .

I should say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer . ) What did he do , Veta ? VETA He took me upstairs and tore my clothes off . MYRTLE ( Shrieking . ) Oh  --  did you hear that , Judge ! Go on , Mother . ( She is all ears . ) JUDGE By God  --  I 'll sue them for this ! VETA And then he sat me down in a tub of water . MYRTLE ( Disappointed . ) Oh ! For heaven 's sake ! ( Rises. ) p. 72 VETA I always thought that what you were showed on your face . Do n't you believe it , Judge ! Do n't you believe it , Myrtle . This man took hold of me like I was a woman of the streets  --  but I fought . I always said if a man jumped at me  --  I 'd fight . Have n't I always said that , Myrtle ? MYRTLE She 's always said that , Judge . That 's what Mother always told me to do . VETA And then he hustled me into that sanitarium and set me down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was a  --   --  MYRTLE A what  --   --  ? VETA A crazy woman  --  but he did that just for spite . JUDGE Well , I 'll be damned ! VETA And those doctors came upstairs and asked me a lot of questions  --  all about sex-urges  --  and all that filthy stuff . That place ought to be cleaned up , Omar . You better get the authorities to clean it up . Myrtle , do n't you ever go out there . You hear me ? JUDGE This stinks to high heaven , Veta . By God , it stinks ! VETA You 've got to do something about it , Judge . You 've got to sue them . JUDGE I will , girl . By God , I will ! If Chumley thinks he can run an unsavory place like this on the outskirts of town he 'll be publicly chastised . By God , I 'll run him out of the State ! p. 73 VETA Tell me , Judge . Is that all those doctors do at places like that  --  think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it is they ought to be ashamed  --  of themselves . It 's all in their head anyway . Why do n't they get out and go for long walks in the fresh air ? ( To MYRTLE . ) Judge Gaffney walked everywhere for years  --  did n't you , Judge ? JUDGE Now let me take some notes on this . ( MYRTLE goes to back of table . ) You said name ? VETA Sanderson  --   --  ( Sits up straight  --  glances covertly at them and becomes very alert . ) But , Judge , do n't you pay any attention to anything he tells you . He 's a liar . Close-set eyes . They 're always liars . Besides  --  I told him something in strictest confidence and he blabbed it . MYRTLE What did you tell him , Mother ? ( She is back of table . ) VETA Oh , what difference does it make ? Let 's forget it . I do n't even want to talk about it . ( Rises  --  crosses to back of chair . ) You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told this Dr. Sanderson you can tell us , Veta Louise . This is your daughter and I am your lawyer . VETA I know which is which . I do n't want to talk about it . I want to sue them and I want to get in my own bed . ( JUDGE rises . ) MYRTLE But , Mother  --  this is the important thing , anyway . Where is Uncle Elwood ? VETA ( To herself . ) I should have known better than to try to do anything about him . Something protects him  --  that awful Pooka  --   --  MYRTLE Where is Uncle Elwood ? Answer me . VETA ( Trying to be casual . ) How should I know ? They let him go . ( Crosses to door R. ) They 're not interested in men at places like that . Do n't act so naive , Myrtle Mae .

MYRTLE Listen , Mother , we 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've still got to lock up Uncle Elwood . VETA I do n't know where he is . The next time you take him , Judge . Wait until Elwood hears what they did to me . He wo n't stand for it . Do n't forget to sue them , Judge  --   --  Myrtle Mae , all I hope is that never , never as long as you live a man pulls the clothes off you and dumps you down into a tub of water . ( She exits R. ) p. 75 MYRTLE ( Turning to JUDGE . Behind chair L. ) Now , see  --  Mother muffed everything . No matter what happened out there  --  Uncle Elwood 's still wandering around with Harvey . JUDGE ( Pondering . ) The thing for me to do is take some more notes . MYRTLE It 's all Uncle Elwood 's fault . He found out what she was up to  --  and he had her put in . Then he ran . JUDGE Oh , no  --  do n't talk like that . ( Crosses up to back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of your mother . Ever since he was a little boy he always wanted to share everything he had with her . MYRTLE I 'm not giving up . We 'll get detectives .

Wait till I show you something he brought home about six months ago , and we hid it out in the garage . You just wait  --   --  JUDGE I 'm going up to talk to Veta .

I 'm sorry I missed you at the McClure cocktail party . The people were all charming and I was able to leave quite a few of my cards . I waited until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient had escaped . Where am I ? I 'm here . But I 'm leaving right away . I must find Harvey . Well , goodbye , Mrs. Chumley . My regards to you and anybody else you happen to run into . Goodbye . ( Hangs up , then he sees the big flat parcel against wall . He gets an " Ah , there it is ! " expression on his face , goes over and takes off paper . We see revealed a very strange thing . It is an oil painting of Elwood seated on a chair while behind him stands a large white rabbit , in a blue polka-dot collar and red necktie . ELWOOD holds it away from him and surveys it proudly . Then looks around for a place to put it . Takes it over and sets it on mantel . It obscures the picture of Marcella Pinney Dowd completely . He gathers up wrapping-paper , admires the rabbit again , tips his hat to it and exits R. Phone rings and VETA enters L. , followed by DR . CHUMLEY. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and wait . I 'm suing you for fifty thousand dollars and that 's final . ( Crosses to phone  --  her back is to mantel , she has n't looked up . ) CHUMLEY ( Follows her to chair L. ) Mrs. Simmons  --   --  VETA ( Into phone . ) Yes  --   --  Well , all right . CHUMLEY This picture over your mantel . VETA That portrait happens to be the pride of this house . CHUMLEY ( Looking at her . ) Who painted it ? VETA Oh , some man . I forget his name . He was around here for the sittings , and then we paid him and he went away . Hello  --  yes  --  No . This is Dexter 1567 . ( Hangs up . ) CHUMLEY I suppose if you have the money to pay people , you can persuade them to do anything . VETA Well , Dr. Chumley  --   --  ( Walks over and faces him . ) When you helped me out of that tub at your place , what did I say to you ? CHUMLEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 84 VETA I said , " Dr. Chumley , this is a belated civility . " Is n't that what I said ? CHUMLEY You said something of the sort  --   --  VETA You brought this up ; you may as well learn something quick . I took a course in art this last winter . The difference between a fine oil painting and a mechanical thing like a photograph is simply this : a photograph shows only the reality ; a painting shows not only the reality but the dream behind it  --   --  . It 's our dreams that keep us going . That separate us from the beasts . I would n't even want to live if I thought it was all just eating and sleeping and taking off my clothes . Well  --  putting them on again  --   --  ( Turns  --  sees picture  --  screams  --  totters  --  falls back . ) Oh  --  Doctor  --  oh  --  hold me  --  oh  --   --  CHUMLEY ( Taking hold of her . ) Steady now  --  steady  --  do n't get excited . Everything 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now  --  what 's the matter ? VETA ( Pointing . ) Doctor  --  that is not my mother ! CHUMLEY I 'm glad to hear that . VETA Oh , Doctor . Elwood 's been here . He 's been here . p. 85 CHUMLEY Better be quiet . ( Phone rings . ) I 'll take it . ( He answers it . ) Hello . Yes , yes  --  who 's calling ? ( Drops his hand over mouthpiece quickly . ) Here he is . Mrs. Simmons , it 's your brother ! VETA ( Getting up . Weak no longer . ) Oh  --  let me talk to him ! CHUMLEY Do n't tell him I 'm here . Be casual . VETA Hello , Elwood  --  ( Laughs . ) Where are you ? What ? Oh  --  just a minute . ( Covers phone . ) He wo n't say where he is . He wants to know if Harvey is here . CHUMLEY Tell him Harvey is here . VETA But he is n't . CHUMLEY Tell him . That will bring him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor them . VETA Yes  --  Elwood . Yes , dear . Harvey is here . Why do n't you come home ? Oh , oh , oh  --  well  --  all right . ( Looks around uncomfortably . Covers phone again . ) It wo n't work . He says for me to call Harvey to the telephone . CHUMLEY Say Harvey is here , but ca n't come to the telephone . Say  --  he  --  say  --  he 's in the bath-tub. p. 86 VETA Bath-tub ? CHUMLEY Say he 's in the bath-tub , and you 'll send him over there . That way we 'll find out where he is . VETA Oh , Doctor ! CHUMLEY Now , you 've got to do it , Mrs. Simmons . VETA Hello , Elwood . Yes , dear . Harvey is here but he ca n't come to the telephone , he 's in the bath-tub . I 'll send him over as soon as he 's dry . Where are you ? Where , Elwood ? ( Bangs phone . ) CHUMLEY Did he hang up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me to look in the bath-tub  --  it must be a stranger . But I know where he is . He 's at Charlie 's Place . That 's a bar over at 12th and Main . CHUMLEY ( Picking up his hat from table R. ) 12th and Main . That 's two blocks down and one over , is n't it ? VETA Doctor  --  where are you going ? CHUMLEY I 'm going over there to get your brother and take him out to the sanitarium , where he belongs . VETA Oh , Dr. Chumley  --  do n't do that . Send one of your attendants . I 'm warning you . CHUMLEY But , Mrs. Simmons , if I am to help your brother  --   --  p. 87 VETA He ca n't be helped . ( Looks at picture . ) There is no help for him . He must be picked up and locked up and left . CHUMLEY You consider your brother a dangerous man ? VETA Dangerous ! CHUMLEY Why ? VETA I wo n't tell you why , but if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent commitment for him ? CHUMLEY Then I must observe this man . I must watch the expression on his face as he talks to this rabbit . He does talk to the rabbit , you say ? VETA They tell each other everything . CHUMLEY What 's that ? VETA I said , of course he talks to him . But do n't go after him , Doctor . You 'll regret it if you do . CHUMLEY Nonsense  --  ( He is going toward R. ) You underestimate me , Mrs. Simmons . VETA Oh , no , Doctor . You underestimate my brother . CHUMLEY Not at all . Do n't worry now . I can handle him ! ( He exits R. ) VETA ( After he has gone . ) You can handle him ? That 's what you think ! ( Calls up L. ) Myrtle Mae ! See who 's in the bathtub . OH !

WILSON Tough your gettin ' bounced . I had you pegged for the one who 'd make the grade . SANDERSON Those are the breaks . WILSON When you takin ' off ? SANDERSON As soon as Dr. Chumley gets back . WILSON ( To KELLY . ) Did you get a report back yet from the desk sergeant in the police accident bureau ? KELLY Not yet . I just talked to the downtown dispensary . They have n't seen him . p. 89 WILSON It 's beginning to smell awful funny to me . Four hours he 's been gone and not a word from him .

If there 's no sign of the doctor , I 'm goin ' into town and look for him . He should know better'n to go after a psycho without me . ( Starts up C. ) SANDERSON I 'd like to help look for the doctor , too , Wilson . WILSON That 's swell of you , Doctor , right after he give you the brush . SANDERSON I 've no resentment against Dr. Chumley . He was right . I was wrong . ( He rises . ) Chumley is the biggest man in his field . It 's my loss not to be able to work with him . ( Crosses up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Doctor  --   --  p. 90 SANDERSON Thanks , Wilson . WILSON Do n't mention it .

SANDERSON ( Going on with his work . ) Are you sure you can spare these good wishes , Miss Kelly ? KELLY ( She flushes . ) On second thought  --  I guess I ca n't . Forget it . ( Starts for below desk . ) SANDERSON ( Now looking up . ) Miss Kelly  --   --  ( To back of table . ) This is for nothing  --  just a little advice . I 'd be a little careful if I were you about the kind of company I kept . KELLY I beg your pardon , Doctor ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I told you it was free . I saw you Saturday night  --  dancing with that drip in the Rose Room down at the Frontier Hotel . p. 91 KELLY ( Putting books on desk . ) Oh , did you ? I did n't notice you . SANDERSON I 'd be a little careful of him , Kelly . He looked to me like a schizophrenic all the way across the floor . KELLY You really should n't have given him a thought , Doctor . He was my date  --  not yours . ( Hands book to SANDERSON . ) SANDERSON That was his mentality . The rest of him  --  well  --   --  ( Puts book in box front of table . ) KELLY But she was beautiful , though  --  SANDERSON Who ? KELLY That girl you were with  --  SANDERSON I thought you did n't notice ? KELLY You bumped into us twice . How could I help it ? SANDERSON Not that it makes any difference to you , but that girl is a charming little lady . She has a sweet kind disposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could n't rate a better date on a Saturday night ! SANDERSON And she has an excellent mind . p. 92 KELLY Why does n't she use it ? SANDERSON ( Crossing toward KELLY . ) Oh , I do n't suppose you 're to be censured for the flippant hard shell you have . You 're probably compensating for something . KELLY I am not , and do n't you use any of your psychiatry on me . SANDERSON Oh  --  if I could try something else on you  --  just once ! Just to see if you 'd melt under any circumstances . I doubt it . KELLY You 'll never know , Doctor . SANDERSON Because you interest me as a case history  --  that 's all . I 'd like to know where you get that inflated ego  --  ( Goes back of desk . ) KELLY ( Now close to tears . ) If you are n't the meanest person  --  inflated ego  --  case history !

Look , Sergeant  --  maybe we better  --  ( Looks up as door down L. opens and ELWOOD enters . He is carrying a bouquet of dahlias . ) Oh , never mind , Sergeant . They 're here now . ( Hangs up . Goes toward ELWOOD . ) Mr. Dowd  --  ! p. 93 ELWOOD ( Crosses to C. Handing her flowers . ) Good evening , my dear . These are for you . KELLY ( Crosses to C. ) For me  --  oh , thank you ! ELWOOD They 're quite fresh , too . I just picked them outside . KELLY I hope Dr. Chumley did n't see you . They 're his prize dahlias . Did he go upstairs ? ( Backing up . ) ELWOOD Not knowing , I can not state . Those colors are lovely against your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's such a trying color . ELWOOD You would improve any color , my dear . KELLY Thank you . Did Dr. Chumley go over to his house ? ELWOOD I do n't know . Where is Dr. Sanderson ? KELLY In his office there  --  I think . ( Crosses back to desk . ) ELWOOD ( Going over to door and knocking . ) Thank you . SANDERSON ( Enters . ) Dowd ! There you are ! ELWOOD I have a cab outside , if it 's possible for you and Miss Kelly to get away now . p. 94 SANDERSON Where is Dr. Chumley ? ELWOOD Is he coming with us ? That 's nice . KELLY ( Answering question on SANDERSON 'S face . ) I do n't know , Doctor . ELWOOD I must apologize for being a few seconds late . I thought Miss Kelly should have some flowers . ( Crosses to table . ) After what happened out here this afternoon the flowers really should be from you , Doctor . As you grow older and pretty women pass you by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls of your youth . Shall we go now ? ( KELLY exits . ) SANDERSON ( Pressing buzzer . ) Just a moment , Dowd  --   --  ( Starts R. ) The situation has changed since we met this afternoon . But I urge you to have no resentments . Dr. Chumley is your friend . He only wants to help you . ELWOOD That 's very nice of him . I would like to help him , too . ( At table . ) SANDERSON If you 'll begin by taking a cooperative attitude  --  that 's half the battle . We all have to face reality , Dowd  --  sooner or later . ELWOOD Doctor , I wrestled with reality for forty years , and I am happy to state that I finally won out over it . ( KELLY enters . ) Wo n't you and Miss Kelly join me  --  down at Charlie 's ?

Miss Kelly and Dr. Sanderson and I are going down-town for a drink . I 'd be glad to have you come with us , Mr.  --   --  WILSON Wilson . ELWOOD  --  Wilson . They have a wonderful floor show . WILSON Yeah ? Well  --  wait 'll you see the floor show we 've got  --   --  Upstairs , buddy ! SANDERSON Just a minute , Wilson . Where did you say Dr. Chumley went , Dowd ? ELWOOD As I said , he did not confide his plans in me . WILSON You mean the doctor ai n't showed up yet ? ( Crosses to desk . ) KELLY Not yet . WILSON Where is he ? SANDERSON That 's what we 're trying to find out . KELLY Mr. Dowd walked in here by himself . WILSON Oh , he did , eh ? Listen , you  --  talk fast or I 'm workin ' you over ! p. 96 ELWOOD I 'd rather you did n't do that , and I 'd rather you did n't even mention such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Miss Kelly  --  SANDERSON Mr. Dowd , Dr. Chumley went into town to pick you up . That was four hours ago . ELWOOD Where has the evening gone to ? WILSON Listen to that ! Smart , eh ? SANDERSON Just a minute , Wilson . Did you see Dr. Chumley tonight , Dowd ? ELWOOD Yes , I did . He came into Charlie 's Place at dinner-time . It is a cozy spot . Let 's all go there and talk it over with a tall one . WILSON We 're going no place  --  ( Crosses between ELWOOD and SANDERSON . ) Now I 'm askin ' you a question , and if you do n't button up your lip and give me some straight answers I 'm gon na beat it out of you ! ELWOOD What you suggest is impossible . WILSON What 's that ? ELWOOD You suggest that I button up my lip and give you some straight answers . It ca n't be done . ( Sits chair L. of table . ) SANDERSON Let me handle this , Wilson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , handle it , then . But find out where the Doctor is . ( Back of desk . ) SANDERSON Dr. Chumley did come into Charlie 's Place , you say ? ELWOOD He did , and I was very glad to see him . WILSON Go on  --   --  ELWOOD He had asked for me , and naturally the proprietor brought him over and left him . We exchanged the conventional greetings . I said , " How do you do , Dr. Chumley , " and he said , " How do you do , Mr. Dowd . " I believe we said that at least once . WILSON Okay  --  okay  --  ELWOOD I am trying to be factual . I then introduced him to Harvey . WILSON To who ? KELLY A white rabbit . Six feet tall . WILSON Six feet ! ELWOOD Six feet one and a half ! WILSON Okay  --  fool around with him , and the Doctor is probably some place bleedin ' to death in a ditch . ELWOOD If those were his plans for the evening he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 98 ELWOOD Dr. Chumley sat down in the booth with us . I was sitting on the outside like this . ( Shows . ) Harvey was on the inside near the wall , and Dr. Chumley was seated directly across from Harvey where he could look at him . WILSON ( Crosses a step R. ) That 's right . Spend all night on the seatin ' arrangements ! ELWOOD Harvey then suggested that I buy him a drink . Knowing that he does not like to drink alone , I suggested to Dr. Chumley that we join him . WILSON And so ? ELWOOD We joined him . WILSON Go on  --  go on . ELWOOD We joined him again . WILSON Then what ? ELWOOD We kept right on joining him . WILSON Oh , skip all the joining ! ELWOOD You are asking me to skip a large portion of the evening  --  WILSON Tell us what happened  --  come on  --  please  --   --  ELWOOD Dr. Chumley and Harvey got into a conversation  --  quietly at first . Later it became rather heated and Dr. Chumley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ELWOOD Harvey seemed to feel that Dr. Chumley should assume part of the financial responsibility of the joining , but Dr. Chumley did n't seem to want to do that . KELLY ( It breaks out from her . ) I can believe that part of it ! WILSON Let him talk . See how far he 'll go . This guy 's got guts . ELWOOD I agreed to take the whole thing because I did not want any trouble . We go down to Charlie 's quite often  --  Harvey and I  --  and the proprietor is a fine man with an interesting approach to life . Then the other matter came up . WILSON Cut the damned double-talk and get on with it ! ELWOOD Mr. Wilson , you are a sincere type of person , but I must ask you not to use that language in the presence of Miss Kelly . ( He makes a short bow to her . ) SANDERSON You 're right , Dowd , and we 're sorry . You say  --  the other matter came up ? ELWOOD There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her escort seated in the booth across from us . Dr. Chumley went over to sit next to her , explaining to her that they had once met . In Chicago . Her escort escorted . Dr. Chumley back to me and Harvey and tried to point out that it would be better for Dr. Chumley to mind his own affairs . Does he have any ? p. 100 WILSON Does he have any what ? ELWOOD Does he have any affairs ? WILSON How would I know ? KELLY Please hurry , Mr. Dowd  --  we 're all so worried . ELWOOD Dr. Chumley then urged Harvey to go with him over to Blondie 's Chicken Inn . Harvey wanted to go to Eddie 's instead . While they were arguing about it I went to the bar to order another drink , and when I came back they were gone . WILSON Where did they go ? I mean where did the Doctor go ? ELWOOD I do n't know  --  I had a date out here with Dr. Sanderson and Miss Kelly , and I came out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run into Harvey and the Doctor and make a party of it . WILSON So  --  you satisfied ? You got his story  --  ( Goes over to ELWOOD , fists clenched . ) O.K. You 're lyin ' and we know it ! ELWOOD I never lie , Mr. Wilson . WILSON You 've done somethin ' with the Doctor and I 'm findin ' out what it is  --   --  SANDERSON ( Moving after him . ) Do n't touch him , Wilson  --   --  p. 101 KELLY Maybe he is n't lying , Wilson  --  WILSON ( Turning on them . Furiously . ) That 's all this guy is , is a bunch of lies ! You two do n't believe this story he tells about the Doctor sittin ' there talkin ' to a big white rabbit , do you ? KELLY Maybe Dr. Chumley did go to Charlie 's Place . WILSON And saw a big rabbit , I suppose . ELWOOD And why not ? Harvey was there . At first the Doctor seemed a little frightened of Harvey but that gave way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore on ! That 's a nice expression . With your permission I 'll say it again . The evening wore on . WILSON ( Lunging at him . ) With your permission I 'm gon na knock your teeth down your throat ! ELWOOD ( Not moving an inch . ) Mr. Wilson  --  have n't you some old friends you can go play with ? ( SANDERSON has grabbed WILSON and is struggling with him . ) WILSON ( He is being held . Glares fiercely at ELWOOD . KELLY , dials phone . ) The nerve of this guy ! He could n't come out here with an ordinary case of D.T. 's . No . He has to come out with a six-foot rabbit . p. 102 ELWOOD ( Rises  --  goes toward desk L. ) Stimulating as all this is , I really must be getting down-town . KELLY ( On phone . ) Charlie 's Place ? Is Dr. Chumley anywhere around there ? He was there with Mr. Dowd earlier in the evening . What ? Well , do n't bite my head off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mad . He said Mr. Dowd was welcome any time , but his friend was not . ELWOOD That 's Mr. McNulty the bartender . He thinks a lot of me . Now let 's all go down and have a drink . WILSON Wait a minute  --   --  KELLY Mr. Dowd  --   --  ( Goes over to him . ) ELWOOD Yes , my dear  --  may I hold your hand ? KELLY Yes  --  if you want to . ( ELWOOD does . ) Poor Mrs. Chumley is so worried . Something must have happened to the Doctor . Wo n't you please try and remember something  --  something else that might help her ? Please  --   --  ELWOOD For you I would do anything . I would almost be willing to live my life over again . Almost . But I 've told it all . p. 103 KELLY You 're sure ? ELWOOD Quite sure  --  but ask me again , anyway , wo n't you ? I liked that warm tone you had in your voice just then . SANDERSON ( Without realizing he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KELLY . ) WILSON Oh , nuts ! ELWOOD What ? WILSON Nuts ! ELWOOD Oh ! I must be going . I have things to do . KELLY Mr. Dowd , what is it you do ? ELWOOD ( Sits , as KELLY sits R. of desk . ) Harvey and I sit in the bars and we have a drink or two and play the juke-box . Soon the faces of the other people turn toward mine and smile . They are saying : " We do n't know your name , Mister , but you 're a lovely fellow . " Harvey and I warm ourselves in all these golden moments . We have entered as strangers  --  soon we have friends . They come over . They sit with us . They drink with us . They talk to us . They tell about the big terrible things they have done . The big wonderful things they will do . Their hopes , their regrets , their loves , their hates . All very large because nobody ever brings anything small into a bar . Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grander than anything they offer me . When they leave , they leave impressed . The same people seldom come back  --  but that 's envy , my dear . There 's a little bit of envy in the best of us  --  too bad , is n't it ? p. 104 SANDERSON ( Leaning forward . ) How did you happen to call him Harvey ? ELWOOD Harvey is his name . SANDERSON How do you know that ? ELWOOD That was rather an interesting coincidence , Doctor . One night several years ago I was walking early in the evening along Fairfax Street  --  between 18th and 19th . You know that block ? SANDERSON Yes , yes . ELWOOD I had just helped Ed Hickey into a taxi . Ed had been mixing his rye with his gin , and I felt he needed conveying . I started to walk down the street when I heard a voice saying : " Good evening , Mr. Dowd . " I turned and there was this great white rabbit leaning against a lamp-post . Well , I thought nothing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as I have lived in this one , you get used to the fact that everybody knows your name . Naturally , I went over to chat with him . He said to me : " Ed Hickey is a little spiffed this evening , or could I be mistaken ? " Well , of course he was not mistaken . I think the world and all of Ed but he was spiffed . Well , anyway , we stood there and talked , and finally I said  --  " You have the advantage of me . You know my name and I do n't know yours . " Right back at me he said : " What name do you like ? " Well , I did n't even have to think a minute : Harvey has always been my favorite name . So I said , " Harvey , " and this is the interesting part of the whole thing . He said  --  " What a coincidence ! My name happens to be Harvey . " p. 105 SANDERSON ( Crossing above desk . ) What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . John Frederick . SANDERSON Dowd , when you were a child you had a playmate , did n't you ? Someone you were very fond of  --  with whom you spent many happy , carefree hours ? ELWOOD Oh , yes , Doctor . Did n't you ? SANDERSON What was his name ? ELWOOD Verne . Verne McElhinney . Did you ever know the McElhinneys , Doctor ? SANDERSON No . ELWOOD Too bad . There were a lot of them , and they circulated . Wonderful people . SANDERSON Think carefully , Dowd . Was n't there someone , somewhere , some time , whom you knew  --  by the name of Harvey ? Did n't you ever know anybody by that name ? ELWOOD No , Doctor . No one . Maybe that 's why I always had such hopes for it . SANDERSON Come on , Wilson , well take Mr. Dowd upstairs now . WILSON I 'm taking him nowhere . You 've made this your show  --  now run it . Lettin ' him sit here  --  forgettin ' all about Dr. Chumley ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 106 SANDERSON Come on , Dowd  --  ( Pause . Putting out his hand . ) Come on , Elwood  --  ELWOOD ( Rises . ) Very well , Lyman . ( SANDERSON and KELLY take him to door . ) But I 'm afraid I wo n't be able to visit with you for long . I have promised Harvey I will take him to the floor-show . ( THEY exit U.C. ) ( WILSON is alone . Sits at desk , looks at his watch . ) WILSON Oh , boy ! ( Puts head in arms on desk . ) ( DR . CHUMLEY enters L. WILSON does not see him until he gets almost C. stage . ) WILSON ( Jumping up , going to him . ) Dr. Chumley  --  Are you all right ? CHUMLEY All right ? Of course I 'm all right .

The remarks are not important . CHUMLEY I want to know how she got this creature out of her sanitarium  --  I mean  --  her home . MYRTLE I hate to have you tell him , Judge . It is n't a bit like Mother . WILSON Quit stalling . Let 's have it . p. 111 JUDGE She looked him right in the eye and exclaimed in the heat of anger  --  " To hell with you ! " CHUMLEY ( Looking at door . ) " To hell with you ! " He left ? JUDGE Yes , he left . But that 's beside the point . The point is  --  is it perjury or is it something we can cope with ? I ask for your opinion . ( KELLY enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) SANDERSON Ruthie ! I 've been looking all over for you . CHUMLEY Dr. Sanderson , disregard what I said this afternoon . I want you on my staff . You are a very astute young man . KELLY Oh , Lyman ! Did you hear ? SANDERSON Oh , baby ! KELLY See you later . ( Exits U.C. , blowing him a kiss . SANDERSON exits into his office . ) MYRTLE You 've just got to keep Uncle Elwood out here , Doctor . ( JUDGE . crosses to desk . ) CHUMLEY No . I want this sanitarium the way it was before that man came out here this afternoon . MYRTLE I know what you mean . p. 112 CHUMLEY You do ? MYRTLE Well , it certainly gets on anyone 's nerves the way Uncle Elwood knows what 's going to happen before it happens . This morning , for instance , he told us that Harvey told him Mrs. McElhinney 's Aunt Rose would drop in on her unexpectedly tonight from Cleveland . CHUMLEY And did she ? MYRTLE Did she what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she would ? MYRTLE Oh , yes . Those things always turn out the way Uncle Elwood says they will  --  but what of it ? What do we care about the McElhinneys ? CHUMLEY You say this sort of thing happens often ? MYRTLE Yes , and is n't it silly ? Uncle Elwood says Harvey tells him everything . Harvey knows everything . How could he when there is no such thing as Harvey ? CHUMLEY ( Goes over , tries lock at door R. ) Fly-specks . I 've been spending my life among fly-specks while miracles have been leaning on lamp-posts on 18th and Fairfax . VETA ( Enters down L. Looks around cautiously . Sighs with relief . ) Good . Nobody here but people . p. 113 MYRTLE Oh , Mother ! You promised you would n't come out here . VETA Well , good evening . Now , Myrtle Mae , I brought Elwood 's bathrobe . Well , why are you all just sitting here ? I thought you 'd be committing him . JUDGE Sit down there , girl . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sit down there . ( Sits chair R. of desk . ) WILSON How about you and me stepping out Saturday night , Myrtle Mae ? VETA Certainly not . Myrtle Mae , come here . MYRTLE I 'm sorry . ( Goes down to Veta . ) VETA Is everything settled ? CHUMLEY It will be . SANDERSON ( Enters from his office . ) Doctor , may I give an opinion ? CHUMLEY Yes , do . By all means . VETA ( Sniffing . ) His opinion ! Omar  --  he 's the doctor I told you about . The eyes ! SANDERSON It 's my opinion that Elwood P. Dowd is suffering from a third-degree hallucination and the  --  ( Pointing at Veta 's back. ) other party concerned is the victim of auto-suggestion . I recommend shock formula number 977 for him and bed-rest at home for  --  ( Points again. ) p. 114 CHUMLEY You do ? SANDERSON That 's my diagnosis , Doctor . ( To Veta . ) Mr. Dowd will not see this rabbit any more after this injection . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you call my brother a psychopathic case ! There 's never been anything like that in our family . MYRTLE If you did n't think Uncle Elwood was psychopathic , why did you bring him out here ? VETA Where else could I take him , I could n't take him to jail , could I ? Besides , this is not your uncle 's fault . Why did Harvey have to speak to him in the first place ? With the town full of people , why did he have to bother Elwood ? JUDGE Stop putting your oar in . Keep your oar out . If this shock formula brings people back to reality , give it to him . That 's where we want Elwood . CHUMLEY I 'm not sure that it would work in a case of this kind , Doctor . SANDERSON It always has . VETA Harvey always follows Elwood home . CHUMLEY He does ? VETA Yes . But if you give him the formula and Elwood does n't see Harvey , he wo n't let him in . Then when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . p. 115 MYRTLE Mother , wo n't you stop talking about Harvey as if there was such a thing ? VETA Myrtle Mae , you 've got a lot to learn and I hope you never learn it . ( She starts up toward Wilson . ) ( ELWOOD is heard off stage humming . ) JUDGE Sh ! Here he is . ELWOOD ( Enters C. ) Good evening , everybody . ( ALL nod . ) VETA Good evening , Elwood . I 've brought you your bathrobe . ELWOOD Thank you , Veta . JUDGE Well , Chumley , what do we do ? We 've got to do something . VETA Oh , yes , we must . MYRTLE I should say so . CHUMLEY ( Looking at door . ) Yes , it 's imperative . ELWOOD Well , while you 're making up your minds , why do n't we all go down to Charlie 's and have a drink ? VETA You 're not going anywhere , Elwood . You 're staying here . MYRTLE Yes , Uncle Elwood . JUDGE Stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave . You want me to stay . An element of conflict in any discussion is a good thing . It means everybody is taking part and nobody is left out . I like that . Oh  --  how did you get along with Harvey , Doctor ? CHUMLEY Sh-h ! JUDGE We 're waiting for your answer , Doctor . CHUMLEY What ? JUDGE What is your decision ? CHUMLEY I must be alone with this man . Will you all step into the other room ? ( MYRTLE exits U.L. ) I 'll have my diagnosis in a moment . VETA Do hurry , Doctor CHUMLEY I will . VETA You stay here , Elwood . ( She and JUDGE GAFFNEY exit U.L. ) CHUMLEY Here , Mr. Dowd . Let me give you this chair . ( Indicates chair L. of table R. ) Let me give you a cigar . ( Does so . ) Is there anything else I can get you ? ELWOOD ( Seated in chair . ) What did you have in mind ? CHUMLEY Mr. Dowd  --  ( Lowers voice , looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? Where do you come from ? p. 117 ELWOOD ( Getting out card . ) Did n't I give you one of my cards ? CHUMLEY And where on the face of this tired old earth did you find a thing like him ? ELWOOD Harvey the Pooka ? CHUMLEY ( Sits chair R. of table . ) Is it true that he has a function  --  that he  --   --  ? ELWOOD Gets advance notice ? I 'm happy to say it is . Harvey is versatile . Harvey can stop clocks . CHUMLEY What ? ELWOOD You 've heard that expression , " His face would stop a clock " ? CHUMLEY Yes . But why ? To what purpose ? ELWOOD Harvey says that he can look at your clock and stop it and you can go away as long as you like with whomever you like and go as far as you like . And when you come back not one minute will have ticked by . CHUMLEY You mean that he actually  --   --  ? ( Looks toward office . ) ELWOOD Einstein has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and space  --  but any objections . CHUMLEY And does he do this for you ? p. 118 ELWOOD He is willing to at any time , but so far I 've never been able to think of any place I 'd rather be . I always have a wonderful time just where I am , whomever I 'm with . I 'm having a fine time right now with you , Doctor . ( Holds up cigar . ) Corona-Corona . CHUMLEY I know where I 'd go . ELWOOD Where ? CHUMLEY I 'd go to Akron . ELWOOD Akron ? CHUMLEY There 's a cottage camp outside Akron in a grove of maple trees , cool , green , beautiful . ELWOOD My favorite tree . CHUMLEY I would go there with a pretty young woman , a strange woman , a quiet woman . ELWOOD Under a tree ? CHUMLEY I would n't even want to know her name . I would be  --  just Mr. Brown . ELWOOD Why would n't you want to know her name ? You might be acquainted with the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would talk to her . I would tell her things I have never told anyone  --  things that are locked in here . ( Beats his breast . ELWOOD looks over at his chest with interest . ) And then I would send out for more cold beer . p. 119 ELWOOD No whiskey ? CHUMLEY Beer is better . ELWOOD Maybe under a tree . But she might like a highball . CHUMLEY I would n't let her talk to me , but as I talked I would want her to reach out a soft white hand and stroke my head and say , " Poor thing ! Oh , you poor , poor thing ! " ELWOOD How long would you like that to go on ? CHUMLEY Two weeks . ELWOOD Would n't that get monotonous ? Just Akron , beer , and " poor , poor thing " for two weeks ? CHUMLEY No . No , it would not . It would be wonderful . ELWOOD I ca n't help but feel you 're making a mistake in not allowing that woman to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have picked up some very interesting little news items . And I 'm sure you 're making a mistake with all that beer and no whiskey . But it 's your two weeks . CHUMLEY ( Dreamily . ) Cold beer at Akron and one last fling ! God , man ! ELWOOD Do you think you 'd like to lie down for awhile ? CHUMLEY No . No . Tell me Mr. Dowd , could he  --  would he do this for me ? p. 120 ELWOOD He could and he might . I have never heard Harvey say a word against Akron . By the way , Doctor , where is Harvey ? CHUMLEY ( Rising , Very cautiously . ) Why , do n't you know ? ELWOOD The last time I saw him he was with you . CHUMLEY Ah ! ELWOOD Oh ! He 's probably waiting for me down at Charlie 's . CHUMLEY ( With a look of cunning toward his office . ) That 's it ! He 's down at Charlie 's . ELWOOD Excuse me , Doctor . ( Rises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) No , no Mr. Dowd . Not in there . ELWOOD I could n't leave without saying good-night to my friend , Dr. Sanderson . CHUMLEY Mr. Dowd , Dr. Sanderson is not your friend . None of those people are your friends . I am your friend . ELWOOD Thank you , Doctor . And I 'm yours . CHUMLEY And this sister of yours  --  she is at the bottom of this conspiracy against you . She 's trying to persuade me to lock you up . Today she had commitment papers drawn up . She 's got your power of attorney and the key to your safety box . She brought you out here  --   --  p. 121 ELWOOD My sister did all that in one afternoon ? Veta is certainly a whirlwind . CHUMLEY ( Moving down below desk . ) God , man , have n't you any righteous indignation ? ELWOOD Dr. Chumley , my mother used to say to me , " In this world , Elwood "  --  she always called me Elwood  --  she 'd say , " In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart or oh , so pleasant . " For years I was smart . I recommend pleasant . You may quote me . CHUMLEY Just the same , I will protect you if I have to commit her . Would you like me to do that ? ELWOOD No , Doctor , not unless Veta wanted it that way . Oh , not that you do n't have a nice place out here , but I think Veta would be happier at home with me and Harvey and Myrtle Mae . ( KELLY enters from C. with flower in hair , goes to put magazines on table R. ELWOOD turns to her . ) Miss Kelly ! " Diviner grace has never brightened this enchanting face ! " ( To Chumley . ) Ovid 's Fifth Elegy . ( To Miss Kelly . ) My dear , you will never look lovelier ! KELLY I 'll never feel happier , Mr. Dowd . I know it . ( Kisses him . ) CHUMLEY Well ! p. 122 KELLY Yes , Doctor . ( Exits up stairs C. ) ( WILSON enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wonder if I would be able to remember any more of that poem ? WILSON Say , maybe this rabbit gag is a good one . Kelly never kissed me . ELWOOD ( Looking at Wilson . ) Ovid has always been my favorite poet . WILSON O.K. , pal  --  You 're discharged . This way out  --  ( Takes him by arm down stage . ) CHUMLEY Wilson ! Take your hands off that man ! WILSON ( R. of desk . ) What ? CHUMLEY Apologize to Mr. Dowd . WILSON Apologize to him  --  this guy with the rabbit ? ( He is below desk . ) CHUMLEY ( Looking toward his office . ) Apologize ! Apologize  --   --  WILSON I apologize . This is the door . ELWOOD If I leave , I 'll remember . ( WILSON exits D.L. ) p. 123 CHUMLEY Wait a minute , Dowd . Do women often come up to you and kiss you like Miss Kelly did just now ? ELWOOD Every once in a while . CHUMLEY Yes ? ELWOOD I encourage it , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I 've got to have that rabbit ! Go ahead and knock . ( ELWOOD starts for Sanderson 's door just as SANDERSON comes out . ) ELWOOD Dr. Sanderson , I could n't leave without  --   --  SANDERSON Just a minute , Dowd  --  ( To Chumley . ) Doctor , do you agree with my diagnosis ? CHUMLEY Yes , yes ! Call them all in . SANDERSON Thank you , Doctor . Mrs. Simmons  --  Judge Gaffney  --  will you step in here for a minute , please ? VETA ( Enters . ) Is it settled ? ( MYRTLE and JUDGE enter . ) CHUMLEY I find I concur with Dr. Sanderson ! SANDERSON Thank you , Doctor . MYRTLE Oh , that 's wonderful ! What a relief ! p. 124 JUDGE Good boy ! ELWOOD Well , let 's celebrate  --  ( Takes little book out of his pocket . ) I 've got some new bars listed in the back of this book . CHUMLEY ( Speaking to others in low tone . ) This injection carries a violent reaction . We ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he give it ? VETA Of course he will , if I ask him . CHUMLEY To give up this rabbit  --  I doubt it . MYRTLE Do n't ask him . Just give it to him . ELWOOD " Bessie 's Barn Dance . Blondie 's Chicken Inn . Better Late Than Never  --  Bennie 's Drive In "  --   --  VETA Elwood ! ELWOOD We 'll go to Bennie 's Drive In  --  . We should telephone for a table . How many of us will there be , Veta ? VETA ( Starting to count , then catching herself . ) Oh  --  Elwood ! CHUMLEY Mr. Dowd , I have a formula  --  977  --  that will be good for you . Will you take it ? JUDGE Elwood , you wo n't see this rabbit any more . p. 125 SANDERSON But you will see your responsibilities , your duties  --   --  ELWOOD I 'm sure if you thought of it , Doctor , it must be a very fine thing . And if I happen to run into anyone who needs it , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't care for it . VETA Hear that , Judge ! Hear that , Doctor ! That 's what we have to put up with . ELWOOD ( Turning to look at her . ) Veta , do you want me to take this ? VETA Elwood , I 'm only thinking of you . You 're my brother and I 've known you for years . I 'd do anything for you . That Harvey would n't do anything for you . He 's making a fool out of you , Elwood . Do n't be a fool . ELWOOD Oh , I wo n't . VETA Why , you could amount to something . You could be sitting on the Western Slope Water Board right now if you 'd only go over and ask them . ELWOOD All right , Veta . If that 's what you want , Harvey and I will go over and ask them tomorrow . VETA Tomorrow ! I never want to see another tomorrow . Not if Myrtle Mae and I have to live in the house with that rabbit . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social life ; we have no life at all . We 're both miserable . I wish I were dead  --  but maybe you do n't care ! p. 126 ELWOOD ( Slowly . ) I 've always felt that Veta should have everything she wants . Veta , are you sure ? ( VETA nods . ) I 'll take it . Where do I go , Doctor ? CHUMLEY In Dr. Sanderson 's office , Dowd . ELWOOD Say goodbye to the old fellow for me , wo n't you ? ( Exits U.L. CHUMLEY exits C. ) JUDGE How long will this take , Doctor ? SANDERSON Only a few minutes . Why do n't you wait ? ( Exits . ) JUDGE We 'll wait . ( Sits L. of desk . ) VETA ( Sighs . ) Dr. Sanderson said it would n't take long . MYRTLE Now , Mother , do n't fidget . VETA Oh , how can I help it ? MYRTLE ( Picks up edge of draperies . ) How stunning ! Mother , could you see me in a house-coat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at draperies . Sighs again . ) Yes , dear , but let me get a good night 's sleep first . ( Loud knocking at door. ) p. 127 JUDGE Come in . ( Enter CAB DRIVER . ) JUDGE What do you want ? LOFGREN I 'm lookin ' for a little , short  --   --  ( Seeing Veta . ) Oh , there you are ! Lady , you jumped outta the cab without payin ' me . VETA Oh , yes . I forgot . How much is it ? LOFGREN All the way out here from town ? $2.75 . VETA ( Looking in purse. ) $2.75 ! I could have sworn I brought my coin purse  --  where is it ? ( Gets up , goes to table , turns pocketbook upside down , in full view of audience . Nothing comes out of it but a compact and a handkerchief . ) Myrtle , do you have any money ? MYRTLE I spent that money Uncle Elwood gave me for my new hair-do for the party . VETA Judge , do you have $2.75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a check . LOFGREN We do n't take checks . JUDGE I know . VETA Dr. Chumley , do you happen to have $2.75 I could borrow to pay this cab driver ? p. 128 CHUMLEY ( He has just entered C. , now wearing white starched jacket . ) Have n't got my wallet . No time to get it now . Have to get on with this injection . Sorry . ( Exits L. ) VETA Well , I 'll get it for you from my brother , but I ca n't get it right now . He 's in there to get an injection . It wo n't be long . You 'll have to wait . LOFGREN You 're gon na get my money from your brother and he 's in there to get some of that stuff they shoot out here ? VETA Yes , it wo n't be but a few minutes .

I want you to drive us back to town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my money now or I 'm nosin ' the cab back to town , and you can wait for the bus  --  at six in the morning . VETA Well , of all the pig-headed , stubborn things  --  ! MYRTLE I should say so . JUDGE What 's the matter with you ? LOFGREN Nothin ' that $2.75 wo n't fix . You heard me . Take it or leave it . p. 129 VETA ( Getting up , going L. ) I never heard of anything so unreasonable in my life . ( Knocks . ) Dr. Chumley , will you let Elwood step out here a minute . This cab driver wo n't wait . CHUMLEY ( Off L. ) Do n't be too long . ( Enter ELWOOD . CHUMLEY follows . ) VETA Elwood , I came off without my coin purse . Will you give this man $2.75 ? But do n't give him any more . He 's been very rude . ELWOOD ( Extending his hand . ) How do you do ? Dowd is my name . Elwood P. LOFGREN Lofgren 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Mr. Lofgren .

I been with the Apex Cabs fifteen years and my brother Joe 's been drivin ' for Brown Cabs pretty near twelve . p. 130 ELWOOD You drive for Apex and your brother Joe for Brown 's ? That 's interesting , is n't it , Veta ? ( VETA reacts with a sniff . ) Mr. Lofgren  --  let me give you one of my cards . ( Gives him one . ) CHUMLEY Better get on with this , Mr. Dowd . ELWOOD Certainly . One minute . My sister and my charming little niece live here with me at this address . Wo n't you and your brother come and have dinner with us some time ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when would you be glad to ? LOFGREN I could n't come any night but Tuesday . I 'm on duty all the rest of the week . ELWOOD You must come on Tuesday , then . We 'll expect you and be delighted to see you , wo n't we , Veta ? VETA Oh , Elwood , I 'm sure this man has friends of his own . ELWOOD Veta , one ca n't have too many friends . VETA Elwood , do n't keep Dr. Chumley waiting  --  that 's rude . ELWOOD Of course . ( Gives him bill . ) Here you are  --  keep the change . I 'm glad to have met you and I 'll expect you Tuesday with your brother . Will you excuse me now ? p. 131 LOFGREN Sure . ( ELWOOD exits U.L.

Sometimes we stop and watch the birds when there ai n't no birds and look at the sunsets when it 's rainin ' . We have a swell time and I always get a big tip . But afterward  --  oh  --  oh  --   --  ( Starts to exit again . ) VETA Afterwards  --  oh  --  oh ! What do you mean afterwards  --  oh  --  oh ? LOFGREN They crab , crab , crab .

Take Mrs. Simmons away , Wilson . VETA Leave me alone . Take your hands off me , you white-slaver ! JUDGE You do n't know what you want . You did n't want that rabbit , either . VETA And what 's wrong with Harvey ? If Elwood and Myrtle Mae and I want to live with Harvey it 's nothing to you ! You do n't even have to come around . It 's our business . Elwood  --  Elwood !

CHUMLEY But  --  see  --  here  --   --  p. 134 ELWOOD It 's whatever Veta says , Doctor . VETA Why , look at this ! That 's funny . ( It 's her coin purse . ) It must have been there all the time . I could have paid that cab driver myself . Harvey ! VETA Come on , Myrtle Mae . Come on , Elwood . Hurry up . ( She exits down left . MYRTLE follows . ) ELWOOD Good night , Doctor Chumley .
