A gruff and toothless old lion of U.S.politics growled softly with rheumatism and prepared once more for combat . The Socialist Party held its 1948 presidential convention in Reading , Pa . <P> It was a homely affair . The dingy convention hall was undecorated , except for three red flags and a few tired banners . The 250 delegates smoked steadily and stolidly , causing the chairman to cry : " Keep your butts off the floors ! " There were no parades ; no foolish talk of victory . <P> But though the Socialists did not hope for many more than the 80,000 votes they had drawn in 1944 , they were neither discouraged nor dismayed . They debated as though millions were listening . Cried a redheaded delegate from Michigan : " I do n't want a cheap , lousy , vote-seeking bourgeois platform ! " They sang the Internationale , spoke fiercely against the Communists , the Republicans and the Democrats , publicly pitied Henry Wallace.They argued wildly as to whether they should stand for pacifism , decided against it . <P> After three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he would not run again , it turned out to be Princeton-bred ( ' 05 ) , aging Norman Thomas , who had already carried the Socialist banner in five straight presidential elections . They picked Tucker P. Smith , an economics professor from Olivet , Mich. , to run for Vice President . Then they went back home to hope and argue and wait for the recalcitrant world to come to its senses .
