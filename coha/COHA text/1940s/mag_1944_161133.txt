Ever since last year , when he contributed $160,000 to the then-ailing , now-flourishing Detroit Symphony , Henry H. Reichhold has had the musical world abuzz with rumors . Said rumor : he was about to start 1 ) a musical magazine of national circulation ; 2 ) a new recording company to rival Columbia , Victor and Decca ; 3 ) a national concert-booking agency ; 4 ) a national record-of-the-month club . <P> Last week Henry Reichhold really did start something . The Austrian-born chemist ( who quit Henry Ford in 1927 in an argument over a raise in salary to $7 a day , now runs his own show as chairman of Detroit 's Reichhold Chemicals , Inc. ) offered prizes of $25,000 , $5,000 and $2,500 for the three best symphonies ( half-hour or less ) turned out during the next year by U.S. and Latin American composers . <P> Since no composer has ever been known to make anything like $25,000 from a symphony , the offer sent Western Hemisphere composers flying to the feet of their muses .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
