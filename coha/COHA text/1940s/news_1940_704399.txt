txt Louis ( Lepke ) Buchalter was sentenced yesterday in Federal court to fourteen years in jail , ten years of probation and a fine of $2,500 , and a few hours later Attorney General Frank Murphy , in Washington , agreed to turn him over to District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey for trial on racketeering charges in New York County . Lepke 's sentence , at the hands of Federal Judge Knox , came after his conviction Dec. 20 for conspiracy in a $10,000,000 narcotics ring and his plea of guilty yesterday to nine other such indictments and two growing out of the old racket which formerly preyed on the rabbit fur industry . Immediately aides of Mr. Dewey applied to the Attorney General for leave to try the Federal prisoner on charges connected with a flour racket case scheduled for General Sessions . Mr. Murphy , according to The Associated Press , telegraphed the District Attorney that United States Attorney John T. Cahill would be instructed to consent to the issuance of a habeas corpus , transferring Buchalter to the jurisdiction of the local authorities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be virtually a life sentence . Lepke is 43 years old now . He is in bad health and he can have little hope of being paroled before serving the full fourteen years of his sentence . At the end of that time , if he lives , he will be subject to the strict surveillance of Federal probation officers . Not until the age of 67 will he be cleared of the sentence imposed yesterday . Led a Fantastic Career The proceedings in the two courts lent a striking proof to the fantastic character that had been attributed to the dark , stocky figure of Lepke . The charges to which he pleaded guilty in the Federal court concerned two extremely vicious rackets  --  the narcotio smuggling and distributing business and an extortion system that terrorized the fur industry here in 1932 and 1933 with the use of stench bombs , acid attacks , hijacking , arson and the destruction of merchandise . The charges brought by Mr. Dewey , in the flour racket , concern another branch of the " empire " once ruled by Lepke and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the course of this racket that William Snyder , one-time president of Teamsters Local Union 138 , was murdered . Three of the four men who were to be tried today on the extortion charges also face trial for the murder of Snyder . Both rackets were guided by Lepke and Gurrah with the help of various " protective organizations " and a group of gangsters whom United States Attorney Cahill yesterday characterized as " industrial gorillas . " It was on the recommendation of Mr. Cahill that Judge Knox fixed Lepke 's prison term at fourteen 7 ? rs . The judge said he had anticipa Led the racketeer 's action in pleading guilty and had intended fixing a heavier penalty . Three years ago , when Lepke first was sentenced by Judge Knox in the fur racket , the court remarked that the two-year sentence was a " mere slap on the wrist . " Yesterday , under the twelve indictments , the maximum total sentence could have been 168 years in prison and fines of $190,000 . The shorter term , Mr. Cahill declared , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " seemed " to provide for his confinement and supervsion for the rest of his natural life . " Judge Knox offered no reproof or condemnation to Lepke . After remarking that he had " no wish to revile " the defendant , he expressed his reluctance to measure out punishment to " another man . " He added that , neverthelsss , " society had nothing to do but protect itself against that man 's activities . " After these brief comments Judge Knox followed Mr. Cahill 's recommendations . He fixed a two-year sentence and $2,500 fine on the narcotics conspiracy conviction . Two more years were added as punishment in the fur racket cases , and another term of ten years was set for a narcotics smuggling indictment . The ten years ' suspended sentences were apportioned among the remaining indictments . The act of sentencing Lepke put him out of the custody of the courts here since , according to Federal procedure , prisoners are placed in the charge of the Attorney General . The application to Attorney General Murphy therefore was made yesterday by Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in directing the search for Lepke , which was greatly intensified last Summer after the murder of Irving Penn , a music company executive who was believed to have been shot in error by gangsters intending to murder a witness in a racket investigation . Lepke ended the search , himself : by surrendering to Federal authorities on Aug. 24 . In doing so he saved the city $25,000 , which had been offered for his capture , " dead or alive . " Max Schmukler , who was convicted with Lepke at the conspiracy trial , will be sentenced next Tuesday . Mr. Cahill moved to discharge the bail of David Kardonick , who was acquitted , and thus freed him from further prosecution on the charges . - - Release Ordered by Murphy WASHINGTON , Jan. 2 ( 2P ) ? Attorney General Murphy telegraphed Thomas E. Dewey , New York District Attorney , tonight that the Federal Government would release Louis ( Lepke ) Buchalter to him for trial on indictments pending in the State court . Since the gangster 's trial in Federal Court has been ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had instructed United States Attorney Cahill to consent to the issuance of a habeas corpus , in accordance with the State 's request that Buchalter be delivered to local authorities for trial .
