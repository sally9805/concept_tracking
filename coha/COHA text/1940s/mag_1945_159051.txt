There had never been anything quite like it in the aviation industry . The first to talk was Jack Frye , the burly , kinky-haired president of Transcontinental &; Western Air , Inc . Said he : TWA has spent $30,000,000 to buy 36 Constellations , Lockheed Aircraft Corp . ' s eel-sleek , 340-mile-an-hour airliner . <P> When TWA gets its first commercial Constellations in a few weeks , it will start its commercial flights across the Atlantic forthwith . Jack Frye promised that TWA 's new beauties could fly nonstop from New York to Paris in about 14 hours , little more than half the present flying time of Pan American Airways Corp . and American Export Airlines , Inc . Furthermore , said Mr. Frye unctuously , TWA will cut the present transatlantic fare of $572 substantially , set it at a " reasonable " figure . <P> TWA will also put Constellations on transcontinental routes , to cut the coast-to-coast time to ten hours . <P> Hardly had Jack Frye stopped talking when four other airlines spoke out , suddenly filling the air with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Connie . " Pan Am ordered 21 for its transatlantic routes and Pan American-Grace ordered two for its South American routes ; American Export Airlines ( division of American Airlines ) ordered seven ; Eastern Air Lines ordered 20 . <P> As a result , flying times will go . down on air routes all over the world . The new times : New York to Boston , 45 minutes ; New York to Moscow , 16 hours ; Balboa to Buenos Aires , 14 hours . By Constellation time , no place in the world will be much over 40 hours from New York . <P> By the time this flurry of announcements had died , Lockheed 's smart , shy 48-year-old President Robert E. Gross had firm orders on the books for $68,000,000 worth of Constellations , largest single block of commercial orders in aviation history . With this fat backlog , Lockheed moved into Planemaker Donald W. Douglas ' place as the No. 1 U.S. commercial plane builder . In one hop , the four-motored , 51 passenger Constellation had carried Lockheed to the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lockheed 's Bob Gross has to share the credit with Jack Frye and Howard Hughes , the thin-faced , lanky flyer , tool maker , brewer , financier and movie maker , who owns the controlling interest in TWA . Six years ago , Hughes and Frye decided that TWA should expand its routes around the world . For this , they needed a new plane . So they drew up specifications for the Constellation , gave Lockheed the job of designing and building it . <P> Because of the war , the first one did not roll out of Lockheed 's Burbank , Calif , plant until late in 1942 , and it was for the Army . The Army liked it so well that it ordered 270 more . But Hughes and Frye had a chance to test the bird they had hatched . In the spring of 1944 they flew a Constellation across the continent in six hours , 58 minutes ; another flew from New York to Paris in 14 hours , twelve minutes for the Army 's Air Transport Command . <P> Fortnight ago the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now Hughes and Frye will get the first twelve Constellations before the other lines get any . By the time Pan Am et al get theirs , TWA expects to have such a start that the postwar air race will be just a vapor trail .
