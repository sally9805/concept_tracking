MR . SKEFFINGTON - Elizabeth-Doubleday , Doran ( $2.50 ) . <P> Like Hemingway 's definition of guts ( " grace under pressure " ) , the true test of urbanity is staying power . By that test , " Elizabeth " is one of civilization 's minor triumphs . For readers of her 20th novel , Mr. Skeffington , will find themselves firmly taken in by the same diverting , lightly troubling , perfectly delicate and occasionally outrageous wit that distinguished Elizabeth and Her German Garden 42 years ago and The Enchanted April 24 years later . <P> Lady Frances Skeffington , to whom the reader is introduced in her rose-colored bedroom on a foggy February morning , has been one of the great , the exquisite beauties of England . Her 20th birthday is now less than a month away . Totally unprepared to face this event , she has had brutal warning of it in the fact that her lovely hair is rapidly falling out . Worse , she keeps seeing Job . <P> Job was the very rich Mr. Skeffington whom Lady Fanny married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventh infidelity , and to whose still worshipful settlement she owed 22 years of delicious freedom . Since her illness last autumn , Fanny has found his apparition continually turning up , especially at breakfast . After crying over her grapefruit , Fanny decides this morning to consult a Harley Street specialist , Sir Stilton Byles . <P> A rude shock is Sir Stilton Byles . In stead of expensive sympathy , Lady Fanny gets from him one stinging slap after an other , including the flat statement that her " love-days " are over . As for the spectre of Mr. Skeffington , " Lay him , " says Sir Stilton . " If he haunts you , he must be laid . . . . Make friends with Job . See him often . Ask him to dinner . Lay him , in fact . " <P> So angry that for several hours she feels young again , Fanny sails off to Oxford to reassure herself with a Rhodes Scholar who is ( or was ) her latest adorer . She finds him on a secluded garden bench , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruefully , hopefully , Fanny makes a pilgrimage among the most distinguished of her former lovers , discovers that whether hardened , dried or dimmed with age they all look at her in the same way . The stabbing malice with which Novelist Elizabeth portrays these gentlemen , the skill with which she leads fragile Fanny to put away vanity and resort to wisdom , her airy invention of incident put Mr. Skeffington in the class of favorite novels for women . Few readers will lay it down until Mr. Skeffington is finally laid - and the meaning of his first name incidentally unfolded . <P> The lady known as Elizabeth is now an old lady of 74 . Born Mary Annette Beauchamp ( pronounced Beecham ) , a cousin of the late Katherine Mansfield ( Kathleen Beauchamp ) , she was married first to a German nobleman , Count von Arnim , and in 1916 to the second Earl Russell , elder brother of Philosopher Bertrand Russell . After their separation a few years later , she lived and worked in Switzerland , England and France . Last summer she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at the Dublin Inn , Dublin , N. H. In the autumn , driving her own small car , she proceeded to the Gold Eagle Tavern at Beaufort ( pronounced Bufert ) , S. C. There last week she and her cocker spaniel , Billy , savored the spring .
