Tall , many-talented Alford Joseph Williams has been a baseball pitcher ( for the New York Giants ) , a naval aviator , No. 1 U. S. speed and research air pilot , lawyer , writer . One of his prized possessions is a naval citation in 1929 , awarding him the Distinguished Flying Cross : " In his articles written for the public he has shown himself to be a scholar as well as a master pilot , and the beneficial effect on the public mind of his example , his clear exposition and his loyalty to the service has been great , and it has reflected untold credit to the service . " <P> Lieut . Williams resigned from the Navy in 1930 , soon had another commission as Major in the affiliated Marine Corps Reserve . Last week Al Williams had no commission at all . Reason : the Navy had changed its opinion of his writings . <P> After leaving the Navy , Al Williams continued to fly ( for Gulf Oil Corp . ) . He also continued to write , plugging mightily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a parity with the Army and Navy . The late Brig . Gen. William ( " Billy " ) Mitchell earned fame and martyrdom by doing the same . But Al Williams , on the Marine Corps 's inactive list , considered that he was writing as a civilian . In a column last February he ripped &; tore at the Navy 's sacrosanct Selection Board ( for arranging to kick out eight of the Navy 's best flying officers , who had not gone to Annapolis ) . Last April he received a memorandum from Marine Corps Headquarters in Washington : " Further destructive criticism . . . will be considered sufficient cause . . . that your commission . . . be revoked . " <P> Columnist Williams continued to demand an independent air force and above all a unified Defense plan for all services , meantime asked by what right the Navy Department ( which includes the Marine Corps ) undertook to censor his civilian writings . For answer he got a weaseling memo , finding in one paragraph that as an inactive reservist he was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom and usage " he was under the Navy thumb . Replied Al Williams : " I tender my resignation quietly and without publication . . . . My services will always be at the command of the U. S. Marine Corps . And in case of emergency I shall bring with me my two standard single-seater fighting planes . . . and they shall be donated without cost to the Marine Corps or to the United States Government . " <P> Last week the Marine Corps announced the resignation , said nothing about Al Williams ' offer of himself and his planes . Said Al Williams : " Free speech , hell ! That freedom is only for those in power . " But he contradicted himself by continuing to write his mind about air power . On the day his resignation was disclosed , he wrote : " Ca n't this gang in Washington devise one single diversion from the death march of Europe ? Must we imitate every fatal error to pay the same costly price in blood ? "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
