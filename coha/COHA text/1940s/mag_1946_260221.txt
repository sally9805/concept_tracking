Forty places were set for breakfast in the seventh-floor dining room of Washington 's big white Federal Trade Commission Building . Just before 8 a.m. , the guests arrived . <P> Most of them were men in their fifties - the 14 women averaged 20 years younger . When the last two chairs were filled , sandy-mustached FTC Commissioner Lowell Blake Mason rose and said " Good morning " ; FTC Attorney John Wilson said a simple grace , and breakfast got under way in contemplative silence . For the benefit of the conversationally inclined , slips of paper were placed at intervals along the table , bearing the typewritten admonition : <P> If the persons next to you insist upon talking to you during breakfast-Be kindly toward them . It may be they think you have no inner resources on which to rely , and so they chatter to put you at ease . <P> So began last week the eighth of Lowell Mason 's monthly " Inspirational Breakfasts . " His purpose : to let Government workers escape at intervals from the daily routine of bureaucracy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of life . " <P> Unitarian Mason got the idea in Chicago , where he was one of a group of lawyers who met regularly at luncheon . Mason feels , however , that breakfast is a much better time , because people are quieter in the early morning , hence more inclined to meditation than to small talk . All FTC workers , from head commissioner to janitor , are welcome ; some make reservations two months in advance , rouse themselves an hour earlier than usual to attend . <P> After finishing last week 's breakfast of tomato juice , scrambled eggs , hot biscuits and coffee , guests listened to bespectacled Rev. John J. Queally ( at head of table , see cut ) of Washington 's Transfiguration Episcopal Church . He rose without introduction , to pour out " thoughts from my heart which I hope will aid my hearers . " When he finished , there was a moment or two of silence , then a benediction . His topic : " Unfairness . " Some of his thoughts : " Quiet thinking and meditation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength to meet the tasks ahead . . . . People must seek peace and courage in God . . . . n the words ' Love God and love your neighbor , ' we have the power of peace , tranquillity , courage and inspiration . " <P> " It starts the day off nice , " said Commissioner Mason , " and the next 30 days as well . "
