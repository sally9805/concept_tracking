Children who may babble innocently to the police have always been a danger to underground workers . Last week a story from the liberated Netherlands told how one Dutch Resistance leader solved the problem . With a Gestapo price on his head , the man used to slip home now &; again to play with his baby son . He taught the child his first two Dutch words : " Pappie dood ! " ( Daddy dead ! ) . <P> A week before the arrival of Allied troops , the Gestapo made a last attempt to trap the Resistance leader . They surrounded his house , seized his wife . Then the tough agents crouched around the little boy . One gave him candy . Another dandled him on his knee . While they were playing , the Gestapoboss asked , softly : " Do you love your Daddy ? " Said the little boy : " Pappie dood ! " " When did you last see Daddy ? " " Pappie dood ! " " Where is your father ? " " Pappie dood ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answering : " Pappie dood ! " <P> One hour after they had begun the game , the Nazis stomped out . The little boy watched them go , sucked his candy , babbled : " Pappie dood ! "
