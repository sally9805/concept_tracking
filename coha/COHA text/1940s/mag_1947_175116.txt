From Paris ' Right Bank last week came two messages of hope . The hope could be felt by those afflicted with anything from climacteric melancholia to a tendency to burp at cocktail parties . <P> White-bearded Andr Berillon , backed by the 41 textbooks on hypnosis and psychotherapy which he has written in his 87 years , offered a panacea by hypnosis . Known as the Doctor of Fear because of his pervasive pessimism , Berillon sat hunched in his eerie consulting room , a tight , dusty black suit stretched on his bony frame , a black skullcap pulled over his forehead and a purple velvet tie flapping about his scrawny neck . The floor was littered with bric-a-brac and jagged pieces of skulls . Intricate , whirring machines on the table set colored lights blinking . They were calculated to put patients into hypnotic slumber . <P> Never Again ! Yes , Berillon muttered , by hypnotism he could cure " almost anything . " Could he cure a drunkard that way ? Replied Berillon : " I treated an alcoholic only once . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold up his right hand and swear never again to use it to touch a glass containing alcohol . <P> " The patient returned two days later , saying : ' Doctor , I find I can not use my right hand to drink with , but my left hand picks up a glass quite freely . Could you do something about it , as anyway I am left-handed . ' <P> " To repair this oversight , I hypnotized the patient and made him repeat the formula for his left hand . <P> " But next week my sister told me she had seen my patient in a bar , drinking brandy through a straw . Ever since , I have left alcoholics alone . " <P> An ardent disciple of Berillon , Lucie Guillet , offered the second message of hope . The science she-and she alone-practices , she calls poetico-therapy : the cure , by poetry , of nervous disorders , or physical ailments arising from them . Madame Guillet is a short woman in her middle sixties with an extraordinarily girlish figure , peroxide blonde hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During her poetic treatments , her normally rasping voice , punctuated by peals of raucous laughter , slips easily from a piercing falsetto to a husky , melodramatic whisper . <P> " I bring to nervous therapeutics a new power-the poetic fluid , " Madame Guillet announced . Her science is based on Berillon 's theory of cerebral balance . This theory contends that , in the perfectly adjusted human , the right half of the brain , containing will power and reason , exactly balances the left half , which encompasses man 's sentimental and mystical qualities . When one side greatly outweighs the other , psychological disorders result . <P> Madame Guillet divides poetry 's healing properties into rhythm , sonority and inspiration . Read or heard in the proper prescription and doses , it affects the " poetic fluid " in such a way that the brain recovers its equilibrium and nervous disturbances are cured . <P> Cast Anchor ! At the age of 14 , Madame Guillet treated her first patient . It was her mother 's seamstress , an anemic , timid and depressed creature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Madame Guillet said , " she became so cocky I could hardly bear her company . "
