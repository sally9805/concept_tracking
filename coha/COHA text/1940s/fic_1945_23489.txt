Harper 's VOL 191 No REPENT IN HASTE A Short Novel in Two Parts . Part I JOHN P. IVIARQUAND W ILLIAM BRIGGS was sorry that the press boat was alongside to take him off the support carrier where he had spent the last three weeks . The ship 's officers and the fliers aboard the Rogue River were all good kids , most of them boys just out of college , who had come from diverse home environments , but who were all much the same piece of goods . They always referred to each other as kids , as though to imply their lack of experience with the civilian world they had left . They still talked , aboard the Rogue River , about football and about fraternities and blind dates , when they were not talking about flying and combat . Curiously enough they frequently referred to the Japanese as kids . They used to say that those Japanese kids could n't fly . They had n't seen a kid out there for the last two weeks who had the word . When Lieutenant Boyden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? had returned from one of the volcano islands , he said that thosekids came out on the beach and started firing at him with rifles and he went down low and let them have it . You should have seen those kids go down  --  they had just been kids being trained , that was all . William Briggs was playing gin rummy in the wardroom when the word came . It was like the wardroom of any other ship , furnished according to wholesale standards  --  the leatheroid upholstered seats along the bulkhead , the metal-frame mess chairs , the radio and the phonograph records , the shelf of paper-bound books , the green baize covers on the tables , the hot coffee , the electric toaster , and the cups . " War Correspondent Briggs , " the squawker called . " Report on the hangar deck . The press boat coming up forward on the starboard side . " William Briggs rose and put on his helmet . " Well , " he said , " good-bye , boys , I 'll be seeing you in church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , Briggsie , " they all said . " Do n't get your feet wet , Briggsie . " " Come on , Pop , " Boysie Boyden said . " I 'll see you over the side . " William Briggs smiled at him . " All right , " he said . " Come on , Sonny . " Lieutenant Boyden had molasses-colored hair , sandy eyebrows and stubby fingers  --  he was dumpy , almost fat , but he walked very lightly and easily . From the rail of the hangar deck the sea looked lead gray and choppy . The press boat was an LCI camouflaged for the tropics in black and green and yellow . They had thrown lines aboard and she was bobbing and weaving alongside . Lieutenant Boyden was looking at the light gray sky and the darker clouds on the horizon . " I wish to God it would get blue and keep blue , " he said . William Briggs knew what he meant . An overcast was always dangerous and the radar did not always work . " You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Boyden asked . " Remember it 's East Orange . If Daisy has n't got the gas to meet you  --  but hell , of course the kid will meet you at the station  --  but if she does n't , tell the taxi it 's the third house down on Maple Street , the only double stucco house , and remember there 's a goddam funny tree in front of it , the only one like it there . I do n't know what it is ? like a kind of a weeping something , but it is n't a weeping willow . " " Maybe it 's a Jap tree , " Briggs said . " If it turns out it 's a Jap tree , " Boyden answered , " you tell Daisy I said yank the goddam thing out . I do n't want the kid shoveling sand under any goddam Jap tree . " The officer of the deck was moving toward them and Boysie spoke more quickly . " And you 've got that stuff to give her ; and you know what 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , " Briggs told him . " I 'll call as soon as I get to New York . " " If you take the bus through the Holland Tunnel , " Boysie said , " they 'll let you off at the Socony filling station . If Daisy does n't meet you , just ask for Maple Street . " " Why should n't she meet me ? " Briggs asked . " It 's what I told you , " Boysie answered . " She does too much at once , poor kid . Tell her I said to take it easy . " All squared away , sir ? " the officer of the deck asked . " Yes , " Briggs said . " Let 's go . " He shook hands with Lieutenant Boyden . " Take care of yourself , son , " he said . " Arc you telling me , " Boysie answered , " or am I telling you ? East Orange , not West Orange . " When Briggs was halfway down the ladder , he looked up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Boysie called . It was a choppy sea , but it was only a question of waiting until the LCI rose on a wave , and then of selecting the right second before she began to roll . " I 'll be seeing you , " Boysie called , but his voice was thin and distant , broken by the wind . The LCI was moving away , and there was no telling whether he would see Boyden or anybody else aboard again . Already the episode of the Rogue River was over and everything that Lieutenant James K. Boyden had told him about his love and life was a matter of the past . He assumed that it would be lost in a confusion of other impressions , but instead he could not even forget the tone of Boyden 's voice . Its raucous uncultivated quality kept repeating itself in his memory . In a way it had not been fair , for Briggs had been too clever in piecing together all sorts of silences and stray remarks , so that now he knew too much about Lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping , carelessly , bit by bit , had become a sort of personal responsibility for which he had never asked . Superficially those revelations had the repetitious mediocrity of the story of the typical American boy , and the same sort of dull normality . It was the sort of thing they printed in the Sunday papers . It might have been the story of Master America . A F , TER ALL , when Briggs thought of it , Boyden was as dull as his story . In fact , all his aptitudes and perfections made for dullness  --  he had drawn an 18 on his Schneider , vision 20-20 , emotionally stable , organically sound , high school , three years of college , I. Q. 120 . He was the best that America had to offer  --  God 's gift to the Navy  --  initiative , moderate qualities of leadership , the type that could dish it out and take it without cracking under strain , fine timing under oxygen at 25,000 feet  --  Boysie Boyden , the norm of what they wanted  --  screened at Pensacola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Lieutenant Boyden , Lieutenant America . The only trouble , Briggs was thinking , was that if you knew too much about anyone , even someone like Lieutenant Boyden , there began to be lights and shadows . For instance , there was the way that Boyden called everybody " Pops " who was over thirty-five . Then there was the way he looked at himself in the mirror when he was shaving , just after he had rinsed the lather from his face and was about to apply one of those fancy shaving lotions which he had bought at the ship 's store . Briggs had caught him at it sometimes , as you do when you see too much of someone . Boysie would stand in his skivvies gazing into the mirror , in that complete goldfish privacy of the junior officers ' washroom . He never looked at himself complacently ; instead that tanned , round face of his wore an expression of frank surprise , as though he had never seen himself before . Sometimes he would move his fingers very quickly , making little pellets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cigarette between his thumb and forefinger , as if he were smoking the last quarter-inch of it , even though it had just been lighted . Then his shirt was always riding out of his trousers . He kept pushing back his chair and loosening his belt and wriggling and pushing his shirt back in again . Those were the things you noticed about someone you knew too well , and somehow they were hard to forget . And now Boyden and the Rogue River were a mile astern , and the press boat was leaving the ships of the screen . The lieutenant commanding the LCI was holding a dispatch ; the breeze snatched at it as they stood near the gun platforms amidships . " We 're putting you aboard Transport 240 , " he said . " Where is she ? " Briggs asked . " She is in near the island , " the lieutenant told him E VERYTHING since D-day plus 3 had been moving closer to shore . It was about noon when they were near enough to the land to see it clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray silhouettes of all sorts of ships . They formed a patient cordon , that seemed slowly to he crushing out its life . The closeness of the ships to shore showed that there was no longer danger from land batteries , and that the problem now was one of supply and of blasting the pillboxes and the caves . Even at ten thousand yards you could sec the smoke rising from the island at points where bombers were hitting it as they peeled out of the clouds . It was obvious that resistance was now confined to the southern end , for he could see the shells from the heavy battleships pounding the higher ground . As they came nearer he could distinguish all the familiar sounds  --  the concussion of the big guns , the more violent crack of the 5-pounders , the earth-shaking finality of 500-pound bombs , and in between , the anti-aircraft and the machine guns and the mortar fire , all forming the usual background of an amphibious operation . Attack Transport 240 was lying less than a mile offshore . When Briggs climbed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which greeted him was also familiar . They were hoisting aboard the Higgins boats , and the walking wounded were leaning on the rail looking at the shore , and the deck was still littered with equipment . The black sand of the beach lay just in front , with wrecks of landing craft washed against it and with new ships pushing in . He could see the colored markers , and the tanks and jeeps crawling inland . He could see the bursts of mortar shells dropping near a supply dump , and the greenish figures of a reserve Marine battalion , moving through the dust . Further inland there was a line of tanks , and he could see the flash from their guns and the sudden spurt of a flamethrower . He had thought it was a great show once and now it was commonplace  --  only another part of the Pacific war and so much a part of ordinary living that it became puzzling to think of home . You could accept an environment of violence and sudden death , but once you had faced it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not . That was the great difficulty about going home . There would be that familiar sense of weariness and reaction that feeling of incredulity and doubt as to whether any of it had really happened . No matter how intelligent you might be , no matter how excellent an observer , there were certain things that could never be explained in terms that anyone at home could grasp , things which even the combat pictures in the newsreels had lost . The individual 's response was missing , his unchanging fear and his resigned acceptance . Briggs was thinking of this at six o'clock that evening while the convoy was moving south . He was standing on the bridge , thinking that it was time for the customary air attack upon the shipping off the island , and like Lieutenant Boyden he did not like the overcast . He wished the sky were blue . If there was any sort of air cover , and he supposed there must be , he could not see it . They were a small convoy , eight empty LST 's that rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were protected by a destroyer and a destroyer escort not much fire power against an air attack . Someone had once said that the first fight is always the best fight , and that all of the rest is something more of the same . If you had sailed aboard one transport , you had sailed on them all , for they were all made on a quantity production scale the bridge , the guns , the wardroom , the crew and the troop quarters were all identical . Even the conversation was a repetition that was cut along the conventional lines of the ship . Briggs was standing with two Marine officers , one with a broken arm and one with a bad leg , and they were talking about the island . They had both been on Tarawa and Saipan and they were comparing the actions . The fire here had been heavier but the Japs were about the same . There was the same Jap officer who ran out of the pillbox waving his sword , and the same wounded , dap who blew himself up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same night attack . There was even the same Jap prisoner who asked to be shot , but who quieted down when they said they would spray him with a flamethrower . There were the questions about such-and such company , and what had happened to so-and-so , and there were the old remarks about the dead . In the middle of it there came the rise and fall of General Quarters . The crew were at battle stations already , as they always were at sundown . He heard the destroyer firing before he saw the plane , but it appeared a few seconds later , diving out of the overcast . It was smoking and the 40-millimeters were tearing through it . It was heading , as far as you could tell , straight for the bridge . There was the old sickening moment of standing and watching , and the old impression of silence in spite of all the noise . Then it veered and its control was gone , and it fell into the sea a hundred yards off the bow . It brought him nothing new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same dull relief that became sharper and sharper until it expressed itself in the old excited words . That night before Briggs went to sleep the scenes of the day moved through his mind in a slow orderly sequence  --  the ships , and the island , and the wreckage , and the transports , and the wounded lying patiently in their berths , and the suicide plane . He knew that there had been an instant on the bridge that would be indelible . That was when he thought again of Lieutenant James K. Boyden . There was that tree in the front yard that was a " weeping something " ? the house was the only double stucco house on Maple Street .. . East Orange , not West Orange .. . II -W ILLIAM BRIGGS had first encountered Lieutenant James K. Boyden about eight months before , when people were easier to remember . He had seen so much of the armed forces since then that his faculty for identifying individuals was impaired , and character was lost in the monotony of the uniform . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against that restive background . It was better to think of them all as the kids and the older men ; as a bulk of expendable human material . It was simpler and safer now to divide them not as friends , each with a personal value , but into the Army , the Marines , and the Seabees ; but all of that had been different eight months before . Now he could view his old enthusiasms with the same faint amusement and the same distrust that writers who had been out there for a long while displayed toward the ideas of any new writer just visiting the theater . Eight months before , William Briggs had been very keenly aware of what was wrong with war reporting . He had believed it possible to describe people and places and events without resorting to propaganda and without preconceived opinion . He had believed that an observer could pick out small details , as Tolstoy had done , or Stcndhal . He knew by now that he had been wrong , or at any rate that he had not been up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had tried and failed . It seemed to him by now that the best writing of the war appeared in the impersonal reports and citations which simply accepted everything incredible as everyday , incontrovertible fact . When William Briggs was new in the Pacific , there was an officer at Pearl Harbor assigned to Public Relations who tried to dig up subjects for the correspondents to write about , amazing things that were happening every day , things that they might otherwise have missed . There were kids coming into Pearl Harbor every morning , this commander used to say , who had done the damnedest things you 'd ever heard of  --  kids from Kalamazoo who had crossed the mountains of New Guinea , kids who had been captured by the Lobos in China , kids who had escaped from Japanese prison camps , and who had been with the Philippine guerrillas . He had planned a press conference along these lines one morning so that all the correspondents could see some of these kids themselves , and the kids were going to he allowed to talk right off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast carrier task force of the Third Fleet had made a strike at Formosa . The anti-aircraft fire had been exceptionally heavy over certain of the Japanese installations . Shortly after " bombs away " one of those carrier-based torpedo bombers  --  known as a TBM or Avenger  --  had received a bad hit . Her pilot kept in formation for a time but when he saw he could n't make it , he had ditched the plane about a hundred miles offshore . The crew had been out two days on a rubber raft , and now those kids were back at Pearl . William Briggs had been at Pearl Harbor for such a short while that he was still glad to stand by the hour , looking at the machine shops and the dry-docks and the berths , and this was his first press conference . The meeting was held in one of those Quonset huts , near CINCPAG . There was a table at one end of the room , and then rows of back-breaking metal chairs . When Briggs entered the narrow doorway , the low arched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few women , too , all in khaki . In spite of their uniforms , the correspondents all seemed like civilians . They were beings apart , looked upon with a certain curiosity and suspicion . They all were laughing and talking , slumping down in the chairs and lighting cigarettes , and the whole room was filled with bad jokes and smoke . Middle-aged men , and physically unfit younger ones . were pulling scraps of envelopes out of their pockets , and rummaging for pencils and polishing their eyeglasses . They all wore neckties because neckties had to be worn at press conferences . You could tell the ones who had been in the West Pacific by the bleached color of their khaki , and by their rough Marine shoes . A young lieutenant junior grade opened a door at the far end of the room and stepped up to the table and cleared his throat . " There will be no smoking , please , " he said . His words were followed by a loud derisive titter . " Who said , " someone asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures with all this smoke , " the officer answered . " Who said anyone wanted pictures ? " The officer glanced nervously toward the door behind him . " Listen , " he said , " the word is the smoking lamp is out . " " Listen , sonny , " someone said , " you do n't need to put it in sea language . Go on out through the back bulwarks and tell them to start the floor show . " Then the door opened again , and the crowd in the back of the room began standing up to see . A commander , holding some papers , came in first . Then a lieutenant and two crewmen followed him , looking worried and self-conscious , like bad boys being led out before a school . Their foreheads shone with perspiration . Their hair was very carefully brushed . The lieutenant , short and round-faced , came to a halt behind the table and twisted his head from side to side as though his neck hurt him . The first crewman was a rangy , gangly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose throat kept twitching when he swallowed . The other was thin and blond . He was staring straight ahead of him and chewing gum . Photographers were edging up to the table , assuming crouching attitudes . " No , no , no , " the commander said . " We 'll take the pictures outside . Arc the microphones all right ? " The lieutenant ( jg ) rushed forward and whispered something and the commander nodded . " All right , " he said . " Let 's go . Let 's sit down and go . " The pilot and his crew and everyone else sat down , and the commander fiddled with his papers . T HIS CONFERENCE is going on the sound track , " he said . " So when anyone has a question , I 'd like him to step near a microphone . I imagine everyone knows why we are here . These three men- - " he paused and corrected himself , " an officer and two men  --  are the crew of a bomber from the fast carrier task force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Formosa on the morning of ? " he glanced at his papers ? " the twenty-second . That 's right , is n't it , Lieutenant ? " " Yep , " the pilot said . " The twenty-second , sir . " " They were hit by flak and the motor began missing . They were obliged to land in the water about a hundred miles out . That 's right , is n't it ? " The first crewman swallowed , started to speak , and coughed . " That 's near enough , sir , " he said . " All right , " the commander said . " Two days later they were picked up by the destroyer Scaife . That would be the morning of the twenty-fourth , would n't it ? " A chair scraped . A correspondent raised his voice . " What did you say the name of the destroyer was ? " he asked . " Scaife , " the commander said , " I 'll spell it . S-c-a-i-f-e . Got it ? " " What 's her commander 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his papers . " What was his name ? " he asked . " Do you remember ? " The three boys looked at each other vaguely . " It was a sort of a long name , sir , " the pilot said , " It had something like grass in it . If someone would say it , I 'd remember . " " Was it Snodgrass ? " one of the crewmen asked . Everyone laughed and the commander smiled . " Never mind , " he said . " I 'll get it for you afterwards . But right now I want you to meet these men , and they 'll tell you the whole story better than I can . I just want to say , it 's just a normal story out there . We want folks at home to realize that fliers do get picked up . Here 's the pilot  --  Lieutenant James K. Boyden , USNR. ' 11 spell h  --  B-o-y-d-e-n . " " Where 's he from ? " someone asked . " 21 Maple Street , M-a-p-l-e Street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jersey . " " East Orange , " Lieutenant Boyden said . " Not West Orange . " " Sorry , " the commander said . " There 's something wrong here  --  East Orange . And next is the tunnel gunner , Orrin W. Smith , radioman , USNR . I do n't have to spell Smith , do I ? 21 Parkway Street , Winnetka , Illinois . Got it ? Parkway Street . And then the turret gunner , Alfred J. Komiskey , aviation ordnanceman , First Class , USN. 28-A  --  at least , that 's the way I 've got:it-28-A Thumbull Street . Is that right ? Thumbull Street ? " " No , sir , " Komiskey said , " Trimble Street . " " Oh , " the commander said , " Trimble Street , Boise , Idaho . Got it ? Will somebody open some windows here ? It 's pretty hot . Well , now I 'm going to turn the floor over to these boys . Lieutenant Boyden is going to tell his story just the way he told it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll tell you later . Go ahead , Lieutenant . " ei tJTENANT BOYDEN stood up and leaned his hands on the table . Then he looked down at his shirt and loosened his belt . His two crewmen gazed at him glassily . " I guess , " Lieutenant Boyden said , " I 'm not much at public speaking and there is n't much to tell anyway . There have been lots of kids who have been ditched and on a raft . Rickenbacker was on a raft . You just get out and go for it , that 's all . " The commander started to speak and stopped . There was a long undramatic pause while Lieutenant Boyden stood motionless staring fixedly at nothing . The room was as humid as a college lecture hail , and Lieutenant Boyden was a disappointing figure  --  not the bird-man type  --  a short boy , inclined to plumpness , who was already losing the attention of his audience . " The motor was hit , " he said . " Some days you do n't get it lucky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to give the word we were going to get our feet wet . It kind of threw me when we hit , and I do n't remember much . Maybe Smitty ? that is , Radioman Smith  --  knows something . " Smitty looked startled and swallowed his gum . " Lieutenant Boyden sat her down all right , " he said . " Speak up a little louder , " the commander told him , and Smith spoke louder . " He sat her down all right . " " Then what ? " the commander asked . " We just broke out the raft . You pull a couple of things and poops  --  it inflated , just like they said it would . " There was another dull and clumsy interlude . The plane was on the sea and there was the raft , but that was all there was . The three that had been aboard stood behind an embarrassed wall of silence . " How much time did you have ? " someone asked . But none of them appeared to understand the question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commander asked . " Maybe thirty seconds , but you do n't time it , " Smith said . He rubbed his hand across his forehead . " Was n't it thirty seconds , Lieutenant ? " " How should I know ? " Lieutenant Boyden answered . " I was half out . " " Yes , " Radioman Smith said more brightly . " He was really out , and do you know what he said when we grabbed him in the water ? He said , ' Daisy , get me up on the front stoop . ' He was really out . " There was another silence while bodies shifted uneasily on the hard seats and feet scraped on the floor . The boys behind the table might have been speaking in some foreign language for all they were able to convey . The plane had sunk in the Pacific , one of those orange-colored rafts had inflated itself  --  poops ! Those boys did not seem older or wiser . No fine thoughts had appeared to go through their heads in the struggle for survival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's my wife , " Lieutenant Boyden said . " Mrs. James K. Boyden , 21 Maple Street , East Orange , New Jersey . " " Any children ? " " James K. Boyden , Jr. , five months , " the lieutenant said . " So you were thinking of her out there , " ? it was a woman 's voice ? " and the little boy . " " I would n't know , " Lieutenant Boyden said . " Maybe I was thinking that Daisy and I , that is , Mrs. Boyden , had been out dancing somewhere and I had taken three or four too many and she was helping me up the steps . I would n't know . Then I heard that fellow there -- -Smitty  --  say ' get the hell ahold of him ' and then I was on the raft . When I woke up we were still on it . The kids were breaking out gadgets . There are a lot of gadgets on those rafts . Then the next morning a plane spotted us , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really glad to see that can . When I got aboard , I said to the skipper , ' Let 's get the heck out of here . ' It was enemy waters , but the old man wanted to cruise a while . We were really frightened on that can . " " Well , I guess that 's about all , " the commander said . " And I know that everybody here is very grateful for hearing your own story in your own words . There may be a few points and a little more color , if anyone wants to gather around and ask questions , but I 'm sure we 're all very grateful , so thanks a lot . " R HE CHAIRS scraped across the floor , and there was a perfunctory round of applause . A few of the correspondents gathered around the fliers by the table , but most of them walked out , and William Briggs walked with them into the bright Hawaiian sunlight . He knew he had heard all there was to hear . Those boys would never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as embarrassed as they had been , by that indecent public exposure . He could imagine already the version of it that would reach home . This morning at Naval Headquarters three young fliers of the Carrier Force of the Third Fleet added in their own words another epic to the legends of the sea . They were Lieutenant James K. Boyden , USNR , pilot , East Orange , New Jersey ; his turret gunner , Alfred J. Komiskey , Boise , Idaho ; and his tunnel gunner , Orrin W. Smith of Winnetka , Illinois . Looking at these three lads standing modestly at their first press conference , it was indeed difficult to visualize that they had crashed in the ocean , and had been picked up from a raft only two days previously . Now , no worse for their ducking , they chatted and reminisced almost gaily about sharks and wind and drift , and about their thoughts of home . " I was more frightened when I was aboard the destroyer that picked me up , " Pilot Boyden said , with a merry twinkle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that followed . . . . It was a fair sample of many press conferences , and most of them added up to just as little . Yet William Briggs wondered , at the time , whether it might not all have been different if that interview hadnot been so artificially contrived . If he had seen Lieutenant Boyden alone , for example , if they could have taken a drink or two together , the lieutenant might not have been inarticulate . He thought of Kipling and the three soldiers , and of Owen Wister and The Virginian . It was a question of the personal touch , he thought ? but then there was no basis for companionship between himself and Lieutenant Boyden . It never occurred to him that he would ever sec the lieutenant again . II/ W HEN WitalAn BRIGGS had agreed to go out to the Pacific for a syndicate , he was confident that he would do as well as most . He was rated above the average among special feature writers , although he had never been foolish enough to have illusions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in Paris in 1940 and had been in London during the blitz . He had a clear perspective and a retentive memory , but now , when the time had arrived to produce some sort of article , for almost the first time in his experience he had no concrete ideas . Beneath the window of his room at the Moana Hotel that evening the beach was deserted , except for three small Hawaiian boys in bathing trunks . When a wave broke , they would run for it , fall flat , and glide over two inches of water without ever once scratching their bellies . Now that the darkness was coming on , quickly as it always did out there , a detail of troops had arrived on the seawall and began setting up a machine gun . Somehow these extraneous sights made William Briggs feel lost and unsure of himself . He recalled what an admiral had said to him that afternoon at Pearl Harbor , something about everyone 's being in one big team , and he had not yet become resigned to that almost universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a football game . It was time for him to write a letter home . " Dear Meg , " he wrote . " I got here three days ago and I suppose I shall be moving out before long , but I should like to see the show here first . It is all pretty confusing and crowded . Someone said this afternoon that we are all one big team . . . . " When he went downstairs to mail his letter , everyone else was going somewhere , and most of that coming and going was arranged for in a vast pattern and he was no part of it . He was under his own volition to come or go  --  to take it or leave it . He felt like a neutral observer . In the courtyard that faced the sea he came upon a group of professional entertainers playing Hawaiian music . Colored decide lights were strung beneath the branches of a banyan tree and the artists were gathered on a porch . As he peered over the heads of the crowd that stood listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , clad in white ducks and a batik sports shirt , took his place before a shining microphone and read a piece from a sheet of paper in a mellifluous radio announcer 's voice . " This is the Friendly Voice of Hawaii calling the Mainland , " he was saying . " And before we continue our program of island songs and fantasy , some of your boys here with us are going to step up and say a few words to the folks at home . First we have Pharmacist 's Mate Joe McCloskey . His folks are waiting at Utica , New York , to hear his voice . Step up here , Joe . Tell them how you are , Joe . " Pharmacist 's Mate McCloskey rubbed the palms of his hands upon his trousers and swung backward on his heels and then forward to his toes . " How long have you been out here , J oe ? " " I 've been stationed here for eight months , " he said . The announcer clapped him on the back . " Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New York , " he said . " And while Joe is thinking what to say I 'll tell you he 's looking fine . He 's put on weight and he 's got a good suntan and not from any ultra-violet lamp . " The announcer thrust a piece of paper into McCloskey 's hand and McCloskey began to read . " Hullo , folks , " McCloskey said . " Hullo , Pa  --  Ma  --  and everybody . I want you to know / 'm fine and I like it here . Everybody treats us boys right on this old rock . I want to say ' hullo ' to the old gang , if any of the old gang is left , and I particularly want to say ' hullo ' to a certain party , and I guess you know who 1 mean , and I hope she is listening to me now . Good-bye now . " " Well , that 's fine , Joe , " the announcer said . " And now stepping up is Private 1st Class Norman Judkins , from Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . How long have you been with us , Norman ? " William Briggs ' attention was distracted by an impolite sound just beside him , and he was surprised to find that he was standing next to Lieutenant Boyden . The red glare of the electric light bulbs shone on the lieutenant 's face . Briggs would never have spoken if Boyden had not spoken first . He had a certain feeling of reluctance at presuming to intrude , since he was not a member of the team . " That poor kid must be goddam lonely , " Lieutenant Boyden said , " to face up to anything like that . " William Briggs remembered that he was pleased and flattered when Lieutenant Boyden addressed him . " Yes , " he answered , " it 's a long way from Utica . " Lieutenant Boyden nodded . " That is n't what I meant , " he said . " I had to do the same thing myself this morning in front of a whole goddam room . " " I know , " Briggs said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This accidental meeting was exactly the sort of opportunity that he had wanted . They had all told him that the thing to do was to chat with some of the kids and get their point of view , and there was Lieutenant Boyden , but the difficulty was that there was nothing to chat about . " Gripes , " Lieutenant Boyden said . " I thought you were in the Army , Pop . " " It 's these electric lights , " Briggs said , and then without knowing exactly why , he felt it was necessary to explain himself . " I 'm too old to fight in tl.is war . I just came out to do a little writing . That was quite a talk you gave this morning . " " It was lousy , " Boyden answered . " Do n't kid me , Pop . " " It must have been hard standing up there , " Briggs began . He realized that the conversation was getting nowhere , and he was glad that he did not have to go on with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , " Boyden said . " I guess it 's time I got back to it . Well , so long  --  unless you could do with a drink . " " Why , thanks , " Briggs told him . " If it would n't bother you . " " Tripes , " Boyden answered . " Nothing bothers me . That 's how I keep alive . " TT WAS only in the elevator when they IL were going up to Lieutenant Boyden 's room that Briggs saw that he was drunk . It did not appear in his walk and speech as much as in his defenseless candor . " Yes , " Boyden said . " Do n't let anything bother you . There used to be a friend of mine on the old Lex who said that . Why bother ? " He led the way down the hall with quick brisk steps . " Now , what the hell was the number ? " he asked . Boyden ran his hands through his pockets and produced a key . He pushed aside some empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . Everything in the room had been thrown every which way . There were three beds . The contents of three sea-bags were strewn across the floor . The bureau was covered with bottles and containers of melted ice . Towels , uniforms , bathing trunks , and toilet articles were strewn across the beds and two lieutenants ( jg ) who were also pilots were sprawled on the beds , dead to the world . " Nobody to talk to , " Lieutenant Boyden said . " That 's why I came downstairs . " He picked up a bottle from the bureau and filled two glasses . " Well , here 's looking at you , Pop . Move their legs over and sit down . " William Briggs sat down carefully . " Happy days , " he said . Lieutenant Boyden took off his tic and pulled off his shirt . His undershirt with its quarter-length sleeves had holes in it that displayed ragged sections of the lieutenant 's plump , muscular torso . The lieutenant 's eyes were gray-blue and round , and his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he were not sure that he had heard correctly . " What 's that you said ? " he asked . " I said , ' Happy days , ' " Briggs answered . Lieutenant Boyden brushed some shirts and socks off a chair . " Oh , yeh , pardon me , Happy days , " he said . " Do n't mind the kids . Those two always pass out early . " He raised his glass , threw his head back , and finished half of it . William Briggs sat on the edge of the bed trying to think of something to say , while the sound of music from the courtyard came through the open window . Just before he had left New York , when he had come back to the apartment at five one afternoon , he had found his daughter Clara giving a tea-party for her dolls , and she had asked him to sit on the floor beside the little table . Curiously enough he was now experiencing the same sense of unreality , the same embarrassed effort to adjust himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had lost . Now , instead of a doll 's teacup , he was holding half a glass of raw rye whiskey . Instead of dolls , he was on a bed beside two insensible young officers . Instead of Clara , he was talking to a drunken lieutenant . " There used to be a correspondent on the old Lex , " Lieutenant Boyden said . " What 's his name ? I do n't remember . What 's your assignment , Pop ? " Before he answered , Briggs finished his drink , but the drink made it no better . " I 'm going out with a task force . What 's going to happen to you ? " Lieutenant Boyden had been looking at him and past him , and now his eyes focused unwinking on William Briggs . " Two days ' leave . Doctors . Reassignment , You 've just come out , have n't you ? " " How can you tell that ? " William Briggs asked . " Hell ! " Lieutenant Boyden told him . " Anyone can tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? How 's New York ? " " Just about the same , " Briggs answered ; " not so many lights . " Lieutenant Boyden finished his drink and reached for the bottle . ne other night I heard a New York , nadeast , " he said . " Sometimes I get to thinking , although I do n't let it bother me . That 's my motto , you understand . Do n't let anything bother . It was called Do Our Boys Know What We Are Fighting For ? ' I sometimes wonder why they do n't get over it . " " How do you mean ? " William Briggs asked . He could see that Lieutenant Boyden was struggling with an abstract idea , and it was almost a physical effort . He set his glass on the corner of the writing table , beside some shaving implements , and grasped both his knees with his plump hard hands . " I mean why the heck should it bother them , if we 're in here pitching . We 're in here pitching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm William Briggs was trying to translate the scene into the terms of a human-interest story  --  the clear-eyed young officer speaking confidently of his ideals . Briggs was still thinking of war aims and of why people fought and died . It was true that the atmosphere was not exactly suitable , with two young drunks on the bed , and instead of being clear-eyed , Lieutenant Boyden was having trouble with his eyesight and his syllables . When he reached for his glass again , his arm hit the bottle . It tipped sideways toward the floor , but there was still nothing the matter with the boy 's timing . He caught it when it was in midair and laughed . " Baby , that was close , " he said . Briggs was thinking it would be quite possible to place this conversation in a more palatable setting  --  the beach  --  the sun  --  Boyden back from a long swim , with a trimmer figure and full of the zest of living , defining ingenuously his philosophy . " Well , now you 've brought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell else is there to do ? " he asked . " We 're in here pitching , are n't we ? You get used to it , Pop . What else is there to do ? " " Let 's put it another way , " Briggs said . " What other way ? " Boyden asked . " I mean , " Briggs said , " why do you do it ? And do n't say ' what else is there to do . ' " " Well , that 's still the answer , is n't it ? " Boyden said . " You would n't let the gang down , would you ? That 's the word  --  do n't let down the gang . " " Flow long have you been out here ? " . Briggs asked . " Since late summer of ' 43 . " " That 's quite a while . " " Yell , " Boyden said , " if I last much longer , they 'll begin to call me Pops . " " Did you always feel this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The way you feel now . " Boyden was having difficulty with the line of thought . " If I had n't , " Boyden said , " I 'd have washed out . What d' you think I am , Pops , emotionally unstable ? " " No , " Briggs told him , " I would n't say you were . " Lieutenant Boyden picked up the bottle and crossed the room to where Briggs was sitting . He swayed with his first step , then regained his balance and threaded his way around the sea-bags neatly and easily . " Kill her off , Pop , " Boyden said . " We 've got to kill her off . " " Thanks , have n't you had about enough ? " Briggs asked . " No , " Boyden answered , " you never can tell when you 'll get it next . tell you something now we 're on the subject . The thing is not to think too much . I 've seen a lot of kids thinking , especially the new kids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see how you can help it , " Briggs said . " I 'll tell you , " Boyden answered . " Take torpedoes . You go in over the water , maybe as low as fifty feet . You let it go when you 're two hundred yards away . It 's all right when you 're doing it , if you do n't get thinking first . Just climb in and say a little prayer . " " You pray , do you ? " Briggs asked . " Praying 's better than thinking , is n't it ? " Boyden answered , " but I 'll tell you , now we 're on the subject . There are times when it does n't hurt to let yourself go , and think . " " When ? " Briggs asked . " At a time like this , " Boyden said . " You 've got me thinking . " " What do you think about ? " Briggs asked . Boyden looked up at the ceiling and reached for the bottle again . " Home , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My kid , and when I was a kid  --  all those things . Only there 's one thing you 've got to remember . This is one place and that 's another . You do n't want to get the two of them mixed up . Do you know what I mean ? I do n't know what they 're doing and they do n't know what I 'm doing . That kind of thinking 's all right  --  that 's normal ; and me , I 'm very normal , or else I 'd be washed out . " " So you think about home and when you were a kid , " Briggs said . " I make it into a kind of a story in my mind , " Boyden answered , " at a time like this . " But against that background William Briggs could not help mixing the two things together  --  Lieutenant Boyden in his undershirt and the Boyden back home . " And there 's another thing I 've learned , Pops , " Boyden said , " out here , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be pals with the crowd , but do n't like them too much , because what 's the good in it ? You get to liking a kid and it upsets you when he dies . But it 's all right at a time like this when you have a little time . It 's normal to be more friendly . " He pointed toward the bed . " Now , those kids there are the best damn kids . " He picked up the bottle and it was empty . He tossed it on the floor . " They 're the same as any kids back home . " A TIME went on , William Briggs understood what Boyden meant . It was safer not to get too interested in anyone out there . It was better simply to know everyone superficially and to let it go at that . You could never tell who would come or who would go . New faces appeared from Washington and old faces leftfor shore duty . Submarine s , overdue and presumed lost , an of-kin were notified . You won a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning she would pulled out  --  you never knew just wt . You would go out with a DE and watch the rocket practice , and talk about baseball and the Civil War , and you might never see those boys again ; but on the other hand , perhaps at some officers ' club on some island when the bar was open . you would see a face and there would be the skipper of that same DE . or the transport pilot who had let you sit beside him in the co-pilot 's chair for an hour or so when you flew out to Guam . It was a long while before he saw Boyden again after those few days they had been together at Honolulu . It was not until Briggs had been assigned to the support carrier Rogue River off Ulithi and the whole aspect of the war had changed , and Briggs himself had changed in many ways . The word was that this rendezvous was going to be the beginning of the biggest show yet . There was the greatest concentration of warships that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the horizon , so many that he wondered how an organization could exist that could supply and group and count them and send them on their way . At night the ocean was dotted with their lights , shining contemptuously although the Japanese at Yap were only a few hundred miles to the south . Briggs had just climbed aboard the support carrier and before he had even reported to the officer of the deck he came face to face with Boyden on the hangar deck . Boyden looked well and rested , without a new line on his face . " Hullo , Pops , " he said , " are you going north on this party ? " " Yes , " Briggs said , " and then I 'm heading home . " " Home ? " Boyden repeated . " Just for a month or six weeks , " Briggs told him . " Well , keep your fingers crossed , and wash behind your ears , and maybe you 'll make it , " Boyden said . " Where 's Smitty ? " Briggs had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That kid 's gone . " " Gone where ? " Briggs started to ask , but then he realized where Smitty had gone . " He was a good kid , " Boyden said . " He was n't with us , but we got the word . " " Where 's the other one ? " Briggs asked , " the one from Boise , Idaho ? " Boyden laughed . " Back at Pearl , " he said . " 28-A Trimble Street , not Thumbull Street , re-member ? " It had been quite a while but Briggs remembered . He was transferred to Transport 240 three weeks later . IV TT WAS a fine clear day , and very much warmer than it had been six hundred miles up north , when Briggs got back to Guam . Transport 240 steamed through the narrow entrance of Apra harbor , passing the steep cliffs to starboard with their rich vegetation . The sunlight gave the water over the coral reefs to port tints of green and violet . They were busy blowing out the coral with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geysers of water up toward the light blue sky . There were several new dry-docks and dozens of new berths . The transport edged close to a sand and coral mole , where a column of ambulances was lined up to take off the wounded . Briggs was standing on the bridge with the chaplain , who had been speaking of a group of gravely wounded in the wardroom . " Those boys , " the chaplain said , " have never had a chance to live . " He was partially right , but out there time possessed all sorts of dimensions and a good many of the boys who were dying had experienced years in terms of minutes . In some ways Guam was like an oil town in Oklahoma . The Navy and the Army had certainly struck it rich in terms of the taxpayers ' money . Nothing was too good for Guam , nothing too expensive , because there was a war . Once Congress had jibbed at a few millions for harbor improvements , but now the sky was the limit . They had carved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were leveling off the tops of the hills , and building towns for the natives beside the ruins of Agana . The B.O.Q. 's up on the hill at CINCPAC  --  called Bachelor Officers ' Quarters as though different accommodations for married officers existed there  --  were as comfortable and very much quieter than the B.O.Q. 's at Pearl Harbor . The Officers ' Mess was established in one Quonset but with tables and silver for captains or better , and the Officers ' Club had already opened in another . Briggs recalled that , aboard the Rogue River , when the word came that the Marines had raised the flag on Suribachi , someone had said they would be building the Officers ' Club up there tomorrow . Guam was still enough of a frontier so that the club was like a frontier bar , with a board counter where the drinks were being sold , and a long mess table covered with empty beer cans . The benches were crowded when Briggs came in . Army , Marine , and Naval officers , Red Cross men , and correspondents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over . It was the crossroads to anywhere . You talked and drank your beer and left and only God or Headquarters knew whether you would come back again . HE PASSENGERS were already climbing .1 into the black shadows of the cabin when Briggs reached his plane next morning first the captains , then the com-manders , according to rank , like animals entering the Ark . Inside the two rows of bucket seats faced each other . The life rafts were packed and the thermos of coffee was ready for the evening meal . The plane was gaining altitude and getting on its course . The palms , the deep green , shining leaves of the breadfruit trees , and the roads and the Quonset huts grew smaller . They were well above the island now , so that he could look into the gorges where there were still pockets of Japanese . Soon there would be nothing but cloud and water until they let down at Kwajalein that night . Passengers balancing on their bucket seats , with angles of aluminum to lean against , formed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fliers going back to join new groups , a submarine lieutenant commander , a Navy captain from the Headquarters Staff , a yeoman and three electronic specialists , a captain of the Marines recovering from malaria , three paratroopers , a middle-aged officer from the Seabees , an Army lieutenant with the Silver Star , a lieutenant ( jg ) carrying dispatches . Some of them had pulled out cigarettes . Some were reading paper-covered detective stories , and others were simply thinking . One might have learned a great deal about the war if they had only spoken their thoughts , but they were silent . It was only in the war books that fliers and PT boys really ever talked . Suppose everyone on the seats opposite had begun speaking as they did in one of those books " as told to Bill Sykes or Spike Mahaffey . " For some reason all those authors signed their names in abbreviation . A group of fresh-faced , happy-go-lucky fellows , tanned by the sun and inured to the hardships in the Pacific , gathered about this reporter in a jovial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guam to Kwajalein . " You ought to see the going-over the cans gave us off Yokohama , " the big submariner began . " They shook the paint off the old pipe , " his companion interjected , taking up the tale . " Then we made a pass at that sampan , " the little flier interrupted brightly . " I did n't think I 'd ever see Junior again , " the other flier ejaculated laughingly . " You boys ought to have seen it at Leyte , " the tank man interrupted , unwilling to be left out . " It was really rugged at Leyte , " the paratrooper volunteered . " We really hit the silk . " All those boys were talking so fast that this reporter found it difficult to unravel their skein of experience . That was the way it went in those war books , but William Briggs had never heard them talk like that . ABOUT the time that the sun was setting , he was thinking that Lieutenant Boy-den was a fair common denominator for all these figures seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as a little boy , as a composite of those photo-graphs of children that everyone carried in wallets , or pasted sometimes on the scabbards of their dirks . It was difficult to see across the plane now that it was getting dark . The door of the crew 's compartment opened and one of the crew walked slowly down to the tail , giving the word from the plane commander . They were going to proceed blacked out -- no lights , no more cigarettes . In a little while there was nothing in the plane but darkness . Briggs had once told Lieutenant Boyden that he had first seen New York in 1922 in the spring vacation of his junior year at Dartmouth and Boyden had said it was funny the way things happened . That was the very year that Boyden had been born  --  right there in New York City . There was Briggs , a college man , and Boyden drinking milk . Boyden had said that his father , Philip Boyden , had a job with a printing and engraving company , and had married a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work on layouts . The old man , Lieutenant Boyden said , had been in one of the infantry regiments of the old 77th in the last war , shortly after he had graduated from Hamilton College . Boyden 's mother must have been a fairly pretty girl , and on the whole , the marriage could not have worked out badly . There was one thing the Boydens had always wanted and that was a home of their own , and when the boy was born they moved out to East Orange to a new and quite badly built house which they could pay for finally just like rent . Boyden must have passed through the usual conventional middle-class childhood , and when William Briggs tried to relive the pattern of it , as he sat there in the dark listening to the motors , its simplicity and security conveyed an extraordinary sense of peace . There was so much in those days that one always took for granted . There was a sense of routine activity which included a lively instinct for acquisition usually applied to marbles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some purpose . " I used to have the damnedest tumbler pigeons . " Briggs ' memory of Lieutenant Boyden 's voice chimed in with the motors , " The old man helped me fix them up in the back yard , and Susie was always trying to get in at them . By God , you should have seen them drop , just as though you 'd got a bead on them and let them have it . . .. The boys used to pick on me because I was kind of fat . " It was Boy-den 's voice again . " Until I took two of them on at once . They licked me but I marked them up . I was n't so bad for my weight . I played end once in the game against Summit High . " You could put it all together into a sort of common reservoir of national thought . Despite their disparity in age , he and Boyden must have shared the same superstitions , and the same vulgar word-of-mouth beliefs . They both must have read American Boy magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works of the late Ralph Henry Barbour . They both must have learned not to lie , and not to go back on the crowd . No matter who you might be , you were exposed to certain precepts of conduct . You learned the Lord 's Prayer , and that Christ had risen from the dead , and that you must pledge allegiance to the flag , and that we had fought the British and gained our independence because we could lick anybody in the world . You picked up a few frontier notions as a boy scout or from a visit to a summer camp , and also a few inaccuracies about sex . Those were the things you learned so well that all subsequent knowledge was built on their plain foundation stones . You could disbelieve parts of it afterwards , but you could not forget . HE OLD man used to make gadgets .11. down in the cellar on Saturdays when he was home . " It was Boyden 's voice again . " He had a lathe and a jig-saw . He made a doll 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house . I made a plane down there  --  the kind you bought knocked down , but you had to be some kid to put one of those together . You wound it on elastics , and poops  --  you let it go . " There would be , if Briggs cared to fill in the blank spaces , a front lawn that ran down to a concrete sidewalk , and a flower border with peonies and iris and hollyhocks , and a vine of Indian pipe that climbed along the uprights of the front porch . There would be the house itself  --  a ten-thousand-dollar wooden type of a house that was known as colonial  --  and then beside it two strips of concrete lead-ing to the garage in back , where the pigeons lived behind their netting and where the clotheslines were stretched . " Sundays we would go out in the car . Ma and Susie  --  all of us . The old man taught me to drive it when I was sixteen . He was great at fixing up a flivver . He can still make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty good game of bridge . When he got more in the chips , he joined the golf club because that was the thing to do , but he never had the jack to go there much . " You could place them easily enough from such remarks of Boyden 's . His father would be in the category of a minor executive with an annual income of perhaps eight thousand dollars , one of those thousands of commuters who streamed out of the ferry slip into downtown New York each weekday . " Ma played the piano some . Susie used to take music lessons . " They always did have music lessons in Boyden 's walk of life . There were antimacassars on the parlor chairs and the radio had Jacobean legs and an inlaid front and the gas stove would cook without watching and there was an automatic electric toaster and an electric percolator in the breakfast nook . Boyden always spoke of all those things as though they were in front of him and each endowed with a peculiar importance . He could also remember the titles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was of golden oak and the key was kept in a white glass vase on the piano . There was a set of Conrad which the girls in the office had given his mother as a wedding present , and Specimens of Famous Oratory , and then some of his father 's college books , such as An Introduction to Geology , Chaucer , Shakespeare in two volumes , and a French dictionary . His own room was upstairs over the kitchen . That was where he kept his own stuff and Briggs could guess what it was , even before Boyden told of it . An air rifle , a fielder 's mitt , a box of electric gadgets , schoolbooks , a colored print by Maxfield Parrish of a tall blonde talking to a knight in front of a medieval castle ; and later , a photograph of his high school class , and later still , a picture of the crowd in front of his frat house . When Boyden came back to the States on his only leave , he had gone upstairs to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given him quite a bang . There had been no time to move any of it to his new place , but some day when this show got over , he was going to have a place something like a rumpus room but not exactly , where he could take friends for a drink , and he was going to have a lot of his old stuff in it . He was going to collect a lot of old snapshots of kids , the boys and girls he used to know . Daisy had never cared about those things , because she was always doing too much at once , but someday he was going to get all his things together and sort them out and throw away the stuff he did not want , such as girls ' letters . There was no use keeping too much kid 's stuff around too long . There was the drugstore on the corner down by the car line , and the movie house and the mountain where you could walk along the ridge through the woods and see New York City . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Briggs had asked him once . There had not been a girl next door . She had lived three doors down on the other side of the street and her name was Verna May Lewis . Mr. Lewis had something to do with a public utility company and Mrs. Lewis and Boyden 's mother belonged to the Woman 's Club , and they both were in the Altar Guild at the Episcopal church , but he had never noticed Verna May much . Sometimes in high school he would walk down the street with her , but the truth was that he was afraid of girls when he was a kid , shy , and besides his mother and everyone else seemed to expect him to go around with Verna May . " Would n't it be nice , " his mother used to say , " to ask Verna May over to supper , Jimmy ? And then you two could go to the moving pictures . " Then Susie would begin to giggle , and his father would say , " Yes , why do n't you take Verna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have known what people would say , if you went around with one girl . He wanted it to be very clear that there was nothing whatsoever be-etwccn him and Verna May . His best friend was a kid named Sam Tilton , and God knows where Sam was now ; but Sam was the one who taught him a good deal about women . Sometimes he and Sam would take some of the girls in school out in Sam 's father 's car , and there would naturally be a certain amount of petting and necking  --  nothing very serious ( you know the way kids are ) but he never took Verna May on any of those rides . Verna did n't go around with that crowd ; besides , Mrs. Lewis would have heard of it and Mrs. Lewis would have told the family and then there would have been hell to pay ; besides , Verna would have thought it all meant something , and of course a little necking did not mean anything at all . IIERE WAS one thing that impressed Briggs  --  the unblemished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribute to environment . " Did you ever get to thinking what anything was about ? " Briggs had asked Boyden once . " What the hell do you mean , what anything was about ? " Boyden answered . Of course Briggs had meant the outside world , its economic and political tumult and the events that indicated the end of peace , but Boyden said that there had not been any time to think of any of that stuff . Professors up at college kept talking about that stuff , but Boyden 's idea had always been to let them and Mr. Roosevelt do the worrying , and any kids who began figuring on those angles were in the queer bunch . The family had taken out educational insurance so that he could go to college , and he was having too tough a time with French and chemistry and ancient history to worry about any more deep stuff . He was doing what everyone was doing and it took up all his time . There was the fraternity rush season and he had to put his mind on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and besides there were all the college sports like football , for instance  --  and that was a full job in itself ? let alone passing the exams . He was light for college football but he was quick on his feet and he had played in the last quarter of the game against Summit High . Besides , he was learning quite a lot about life , and that took a lot of thinking . It was n't normal not to go out with the crowd , where there was a juke box and a few drinks , and all that sort of business used up a lot of energy . It took real work just trying to learn and to get things straight without worrying what krauts and frogs and wops and share-croppers were doing . You had to learn how to tell a real joe from a drip , for instance , and how far you could go with a certain type of girl . " Believe mc , " Boyden said , " a kid has a lot to learn , particularly an American kid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about , and besides you had to get to develop some sort of a line so you would n't be a drip yourself . You had to learn the swing steps and the proper clothes , if you wanted to keep up with the crowd  --  and all of that was a full-time job in itself  --  let alone everything else that everyone kept pushing at you . " Did n't you ever plan what you were going to do ? " Briggs had asked him . " Do ? " Boyden said . " Believe me , I was doing plenty , Pop . " Of course , Boyden said , you had to get around to that sort of thing sometime . You could cope with it in your last year at college but there was n't any last year , because the war had busted it all up . Besides you had to get set first , and you had to learn all these other things and look around . Boyden 's idea was that maybe he would have liked to get a job travelling to places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fed up on those places now till they were running out his ears . Anyhow , there were other matters much more important to an American kid than what he was going to do , because you always ended by doing something . Love was more important . There was a problem that a kid simply had to work out for himself . " It 's a funny thing -- love , " Boyden said . " Yes , " Briggs repeated after him , " It 's a funny thing  --  love . " LIB RIGHT , you could be cynical about it if you were an old guy and had worked it out , but the funny thing about love was you could n't tell what was real love and what was n't , not until it was all over and you began loving somebody else . This was n't just Boyden 's own experience either . In fact he knew now that everything that had happened to him was perfectly normal because he had compared notes with a lot of other kids . Of course , he had thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got serious , once with a little number back in high school , and once with the daughter of a professor of physics in Troy , New York , but neither of these was serious . The first time that he was positive that he was in love , so that it fooled him , was the Christmas vacation of his sophomore year , and Boyden said that this was the way it happened . No sooner had he got to East Orange and got his stuff up to his room than his mother came knocking on the door . She was just back from the Altar Guild where they had been working on floral plans for the Christmas services . She gave him a big kiss and said how well he looked It was a funny thing that you never felt grown up when you were with your mother , and that was not just his individual experience either . " Jimmy , " she said , " I 've accepted an invitation for you tonight to go to Verna May 's birthday party . " He had been to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a cake and musical chairs just as though they were all still kids . " But Jimmy , " his mother said . " You know you are very fond of Verna May . " There was no way of getting out of it , because his mother and Mrs. Lewis were dear friends and both in the Woman 's Club , so he put on his tux and walked across the street with Susie , who was just fifteen and old enough to go . " Jimmy 's fond of Verna May , " Susie kept saying . " Jimmy 's fond of Verna May . " There was no use telling Susie to shut up . In fact , it was his experience that you never got anywhere arguing with women . It was easier to take it and walk along and whistle a tune . He was just beginning to learn that some people were more in the chips than other people , but it never bothered him the way it did some other kids . He was just as good as anybody else , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he got around to it . That was why going to a home like the Lewis home never troubled him , although it was pretty big , with a downstairs lavatory just off where you hung your coats , and a sun porch , and a library , besides a living room . No matter haw big those houses were in the Oranges , and no matter how much jack the old people had , they were always looking for an extra man at parties  --  particularly a college man with a good line who was good on his feet . There was quite a crowd at the Lcwiscs ' , even some kids from Llewellyn Park . The dining room table was all covered with little cakes and sandwiches and coffee , and there was a fruit punch and coke and gingerale , and even some sherry . It was a lot better party than he thought it was going to be , if they just had n't played paper games and stuff like " Twenty Questions . " When he saw Verna May standing in the living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that he had never realized what a cute little trick she was . It all went to prove that you could never tell how a kid would turn out until she started working on herself . Verna May was a little taller than he was and that was something that had always put him off her , but now it did not matter , because she had a new hair-do that made her look dark and slinky , and lipstick , and a sort of a yellow-green pastel party dress . " Hi , Verna , " he said , " how 's tricks ? " or something like that , just a casual opening line . Somehow when you liked a girl , it was his experience in some way she could tell it and you also could tell in some way , right off , whether she liked having you like her . That was the way it was right off with him and Verna May . " I never knew you liked me until that night , " she told him . That was one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , you always thought that you had always liked someone that you thought you were in love with , and that was just what Verna May said . " Of course , I always liked you subconsciously , Jimmy , but you were so sophisticated that night . " And that was exactly the way he had felt about her , too . She was sophisti cated . She was sophisticated the next night when he kissed her after he had taken her to the movies . " We must n't be too silly , Jimmy dear , " she said . In his experience you could always tell after you had kissed a girl whether you wanted to go on with it . There was only one thing about Verna May that bothered him  --  or maybe there were two things . She seemed to be too sure about him and she began right off trying to do things about him . It was Boyden 's experience that it was always tough , at any rate for a man , to have a woman feel that she owned you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way about a woman , but if a woman felt that way about a man it was a lot better if she did not show it . Fr HAT CHRISTMAS was in 1940 , and they were always together after that , vacation times . Verna would go with him to see plays in New York , not musical shows but pretty deep stuff . If they were in town in the afternoons , instead of looking in the shop windows or going to a picture , she wanted to go to art galleries where you saw oil paintings of fallen-down barns and skulls of dead animals on the desert . She was different but it did n't gripe him . All that next year , his junior year , he would write her at Smith College where she went to school and she would send him books about China , and books of stories by men like Steinbeck . He read them whenever he had the time , because love was like that . Verna made him finish out his year when the war started instead of quitting cold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been for Verna May , he would have signed up that next Christmas after Pearl Harbor . She had cried when he had told her what he was going to do , instead of being proud of it , and it was uncomfortable having some kid cry on you when there was a war on . It was no time to be studying history and who socked Socrates when there was a war on , but he stuck it out till April because they said you stood a better chance for a commission if you had stayed in college . There was n't any stopping him when it came April , and that was When Verna said something that upset him . She said it the afternoon when he got back from 90 Church Street , after the doctors had spent all day giving him the works . " Jimmy , dear , " Verna May said , " I wish you would n't act as though it were a football game . " Those were not the right words to use at a time like that , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unstable . Verna never seemed to understand that you had to pay your way for what had been given you and that if you did n't get in there and pitch , a lot of little slant-eyed joes would be kicking you around . She did n't seem to understand that anybody with guts was n't going to sit around and let some college turn him into a quiz kid until his number was called . " But , Jimmy , " she said " why do you have to go into aviation ? " She did not seem to understand that all the best kids were trying out for it ; besides , it was better flying than walking in the mud ; besides , you could get a commission and flying pay ; and besides , it was something to aim at because it took guts ; and besides , someone had to do it . Yet this did not answer a part of Verna 's question . Ihrhat sort of faith did Boyden and those others like him have that made them brave ? It must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than pride , or competition , or loyalty to a group . Somewhere there was some meaning in his meaninglessness that escaped all definition . They were dying every day for something . n.ioos was half asleep when he was aroused by someone shaking his shoulder . The pressure in his ears told him that the plane was letting down . The air was growing as sultry as July at home . They were letting down at Kwajalein and a weapon carrier would take them to the mess . Except for the airport and the kitchens , Kwajalein was sound asleep . He could see vaguely the outlines of barracks and supply depots and an occasional decapitated palm  --  the only visible monuments of the taking of the island , When the passengers trouped in and sat on the benches of the mess hall , it looked like an all-night diner . The lieutenant next him asked for the evaporated milk . " It 's a hot night , " Briggs said . " Yes , " the lieutenant answered , " it really is hot . Are you going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee and poured some syrup on his French toast . " The last time I was back I did n't know exactly what to say . Did you ever feel like that ? " " Yes , " Briggs answered , " almost everybody does . " " It 's like being two places at once when you 're on leave , " the lieutenant said . He remembered that Boyden had said the same thing once . It was like adjusting two images in an optical instrument , but no matter what you did those two images would never exactly coincide . V Y THE time Boyden got to Pensacola , Verna May must have heard the other girls talking because she seemed glad that he was in there pitching . Somebody must have told her that what the boys wanted most were good long letters from home , because she wrote him letters that took a long while to read , what with other things on your mind . She told him how proud she was to have someone who belonged to her  --  that 's what she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then she used to ask him what books he had been reading . She would not have understood if he had told her that he used his spare time in other ways . You saw a whole lot of the United States when you were going to those different schools , and you picked up a lot of new ideas . Somehow it was hard for him always to keep Verna May in his mind . He had her picture in his wallet and she had his at home , standing in front of the old crate he was learning to fly  --  but that did not mean he belonged to Verna May . He was definitely not engaged to her , although he and Verna may have talked the way you do sometimes about the future , but she should have known that he always did it in a kidding way , and besides there was a war on . He was getting too many new ideas to be able to read long letters , or to write many back . The truth was that he had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had simply in his mind made Verna May into the sort of girl he had wanted to love . This was the sort of thing that crept up on you and smacked you , without your knowing it was coming . The truth was he could not blame himself for something that was an honest mistake . He had simply known Verna May before he had gone to all those flying schools . They shot a lot of stuff into you there that tended to make you different . You found yourself facing up to a lot of things that were n't the way they looked in print . You realized that you might die if you did n't remember what you were told , about reading a map , or manipulating gadgets . It did n't pay to have too much else on your mind , and yet in a way you noticed more things than you ever had , and sometimes after a hard day when something had almost happened to you but not quite , you were just very glad to be alive . Without its worrying you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally , into a new sort of mood . He could not understand exactly why love should be mixed up in this mood , but it seemed to be that way with lots of people . Once he heard someone recite a poem . It was a kid in a sack near him who had a volume of Kipling , and the poem was about some things being greater than other things , and three of the things that were greater were women , and horses , and war . He did not know anything about horses , but maybe it was true about women . M AYBE LOVE was different at different times according to your mood . At any rate , down at Pensacola , not so long before he got his commission , he was at one of those Saturday night dances at the USO , with no premonition that anything extraordinary would happen . He was simply down there at the dance and someone had introduced him to a little blonde who was quite a cute little trick . She had a turned-up nose and blue eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a bungalow on Mariposa Avenue . She said that she had been dancing with so many boys that her feet hurt and she could not tell one from the other and Boyden had asked her what she could n't tell apart  --  the boys or her feet . Later she said that her feet hurt her so much , perhaps if he would take her home , she could tell him apart from the other boys . So he drove home with her in her car and she took off her slippers , and then she took off her stockings because it was a very hot night . Her name was Daisy Sonberg . Her father had lived in Charleston , West Virginia , before he had retired , but he was really her step-father , because her mother had married again after a divorce and she did not know where her father was and sometimes it made her sad and lonely . After a while they began talking about life and they both agreed that you could not tell what : would happen next . For instance , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither of them had known the other existed the day before . Daisy was engaged to a boy who had left for Pearl , but now that she saw Boyden she was not sure whether she loved that boy or not , and Boyden told her he knew exactly what she meant because he suddenly realized he was in exactly the same situation . He was not at all sure that he was in love with Verna May . It was a very interesting thing to discuss , that lieutenant off at Pearl and Verna May in Orange . " We 're just two lonely people , are n't we ? " Daisy said . It seemed that Daisy 's step-father and mother were off somewhere for the weekend , so they had the bungalow all to themselves  --  just as though it were their own . When they went inside and Daisy got some ice and soda and a bottle of her step-father 's Bourbon  --  running out to the kitchen in her bare feet to fetch the glasses ? it seemed to Boyden that he had always known Daisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that gadget that pried the ice loose out of the tray , he realized the kid needed someone to help her , not like Verna May , who could always help herself . She cut her finger trying to open the soda bottle and then they had to look through the bathroom cabinet to find a band-aid for it . Then out in the kitchen she knocked over two glasses . You better park yourself on the sofa and let me handle this , " Boyden said . She looked up at him with her blue eyes wide open , just like a little kid , and she was shorter than he was  --  not taller like Verna May . " I 'm not fit to marry him , " she said . Of course she was referring to that unknown lieutenant out at Pearl but Daisy was all right . " You park yourself on the sofa , " Boyden told her . " My hair 's a mess , " she said , but he always liked her yellow hair when it was rumpled . It was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sofa polishing off the Bourbon , and they had a pretty interesting and serious conversation . Just for one thing , they were both interested in that radio program where people told their problems once a week , and just the week before there had been a girl on that program who was engaged to one boy , but who had met a second one , and now could not tell which one she really loved . The mediation board had said it was very courageous of her to face the problem squarely , and that if she kept on facing it , her instinct would tell her which one she ought to marry . " Listen , baby , " Boyden said , " you do n't love that heel at Pearl . " " How do you know I do n't ? " Daisy asked . " Because you would n't talk about him to me , if you did , " Boyden answered . That was when he realized for certain that he had simply made Verna May into the girl he wanted to love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toes , with each little toenail done with red nail paint , to match her fingers . " How do you make them match ? " Boyden asked . " They do n't , " Daisy said . " I lost the bottle I did my hands with , and I could n't remember the color when I got one for my toes . ' ' It was true when you looked . Her toes were one color and her fingers were another . " I wish I was n't so mixed up , " Daisy said , and all at once she began to cry . It seemed that Daisy had n't been telling quite the truth about that boy at Pearl . She had n't wanted to because she was so ashamed , but now that she knew Boyden better , she wanted to tell him that the boy had written , all of a sudden , and told her that it was all off . It had not occurred to Boyden until a long while later that the kid at Pearl must have felt about Daisy just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did occur to him , he knew that there was no parallel , because Daisy was not Verna May . " Darling , " Daisy said , " I guess I 'd better go to bed . " Boyden stood up , and picked up his cap . " But where are you going to sleep ? " Daisy asked him . " I 've got a twenty-four hour pass , " Boyden said . " I 've got a sack at the hotel . " " You can sleep on the couch here , if you want , " Daisy said , " the family wo n't be back until tomorrow night . " Now Verna May would never have had the courage to do that . She would have been afraid of what people would have said . At any rate , it was a very romantic thing and Daisy did not care what people said . It was like living in a story  --  parts of it . Daisy 's room was just off the parlor , and while he lay there on the couch they talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerves had never been so quiet . He had never slept so well ; in fact he never woke up until nine the next morning , when he opened his eyes to find Daisy in a pink wrapper leaning over him . It was exactly as though it were their own house . " Darling , " Daisy said , " when I put the coffee on I broke the percolator . " HERE was nothing wrong about it and it was a very beautiful experience . It was quite a rest after all the technical stuff he had been learning , about astronomy and azimuths  --  something he could remember without its taking his mind off his work . The main thing that they wanted to be sure of was that they really loved each other as much as they thought they did , and the week after he was commissioned they knew they did . His pay was large enough to support a wife , particularly since he was going to sea , and so they were married two days later when he got his leave . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which never seemed quite possible . He had bought an old jalopy there at Pensacola and he had a gas allotment to drive it north on leave . Sometimes before Boyden went to sleep he would think about that ride , and of all the places where they had stopped along the coast  --  the pine woods where the tire blew out , the night in the tourist home in Savannah , the day in Charleston , and the day in Washington . There was nothing wrong with a single minute of it as far as he could remember . Of course they were surprised at home when they saw Daisy , but it was Boyden 's experience that this sort of thing was happening all the time , now that there was a war on . Although thirty days was not much , it was time enough to get things squared away . Daisy was not very good at looking out for herself and he wanted her to be in an apartment in East Orange where she could be comfortable and secure , right with his own people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . Sometimes when he thought of luck he thought of himself and Daisy . It had been good luck that they had found the apartment on Maple Street , exactly the right size . It had been good luck after that leave was over that they had been able to travel together , in a lower berth , out to the West Coast and to find two rooms at San Diego . You got to know someone very well , particularly a girl like Daisy , when you batted around here and there the way you did in this war . You got to know what love was , riving in little shacks and one-night stands on the West Coast while you were waiting for your orders . But the best part of it was that there were all sorts of married kids from all over the country in just the same position , so that you made a lot of friends and had a swell time while you were waiting for your orders . Everybody was kind to you , even the brass . His squadron commander had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco , just as though they were the same age . It was a great experience being married to anyone like Daisy , and that was n't like anybody else 's experience . It was something to know that all you had to do when you got leave was to send a wire when you reached the Coast . It was something to remember that she was right there , with a kid fifteen months old that he had never seen , but he had the pictures and the letters . It was something to remember . " It 's kind of funny , " Boyden said , " having a kid in just that way . " " In just what way ? " Briggs had asked him . Boyden shook his head when he tried to think of the right answer . " In that way ? " Boyden said , " all ready-made , " " It 's the fashion now , " Briggs said . " Without doing anything about it , " Boyden said , " that is , at least , not very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it ? " " You 'll believe it when you see him , " Briggs said . " Yes , I suppose so , when I see him , " Boyden said . " You 're married , are n't you , Pop ? Did you ever get so you did n't remember exactly how it happened ? " " You mean , so much else has been happening ? " Briggs asked him . " Yes , " Boyden said , " maybe . You have to work quick when there 's a war on . Sometimes I look at the pictures and I ca n't remember . Sometimes it 's like it 's all ready-made without my making it . That 's what I mean when I say I do n't remember . " There was the story of Lieutenant Boy ' den , a sequence of a few natural impulses and a few automatic responses . Yet the character that produced those impulses and responses was capable of others . With that unpromising background for a beginning , Lieutenant James K. Boyden could wear , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy Cross , the Distinguished Flying Cross , and the Air Medal with a Gold Star . If he still thought about the war as an athletic event , he was winning all the cups . . . T HE LIEUTENANT next to Briggs nudged him . Johnston , " he said , and Briggs turned to look through the small round window behind him . " Remember the sign in the head at . Johnston ? " the lieutenant asked , " about going easy on the water ? One gallon of fuel oil to distill one gallon of drinking water , or is it two gallons ? " It was dawn , and the cloud formations were a soft pink above the pastel blue of the ocean . Johnston Island lay below them , a man-made airstrip built upon a shoal , and Briggs could sec the half circle of breakers on the coral reef . It looked incredibly remote and small , and the faint colors of dawn made it weird and beautiful . Screwball islands , Boyden had called the Pacific atolls once  --  bodies of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screwy sights like that drove some kids nuts . . . Full fathom five . . . . The pink clouds , the half light in the plane , the strained , unshaven faces of the passengers , and then some slight change in the revolution of the motors must have brought the words to Briggs ' memory .. . Full fathom five . . . and too many of those screwy islands drove some kids nuts . The rest of the words came back to him , fantastic restive words , a half-answer to everything he had been thinking . They were all sunk fathoms deep in the unnatural clement of war . No one who had ever been out there would ever be the same again . Full fathom five thy father lies ; Of his bones arc coral made ; Those are pearls that were his eyes : Nothing of him that doth fade , But doth suffer a sea-change Into something rich and strange . Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell . .. . VI IT WAS snowing in New York , and the I snow and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Briggs took the bus to Orange . The bus was crowded and the air inside was thick and wet and damp . He had never been a commuter and he felt awkward and out of place . He had tried several times to get in touch with Daisy , though he had a good many problems of his own . It was hard enough getting ac-customed again to his own friends . There was an atmosphere of unreality about the old faces , and about his former habits , and association had no permanence because he was going out again . When he called the number which Boyden had given him , he was told several times that it did not answer ; then he was told that the number was out of order and finally that it had been discontinued . He sent two telegrams also , but there was no reply . At length on a Saturday morning he was able to reach Boyden 's family , and Boy-den 's father had been at home . That was when he learned that Daisy was away for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't he come out for supper ? " Hello , Mr. Boyden ? " he had said . " My name is Briggs , William Briggs . I am just back from the Pacific where I saw your son , Jimmy . " " What 's that ? " Mr. Boyden asked . From his voice it might have been Lieutenant Boyden speaking . " You say you 've just seen Jimmy ? " " Yes , " Briggs had answered , " he wanted me to tell you he 's doing fine. - Of course he would come out . It would not be any trouble . It would be a pleasure , the least that he could do . Orange was only a step from New York and he would be glad to stay for supper . Boysie  --  that is , Jimmy  --  they called him Boysic out there on the carrier  --  had told him so much about his family that he felt he knew them already . That was the way one always put it . He could n't go back without having seen them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was going back again  --  and it would be no trouble at all . It would be a pleasure , the least that anyone could do . That was the way one always put it  --  the least and it was almost nothing . He knew if he had not gone that it would have been like leaving the theater before the last curtain . There was something along that bus-line for which someone like Boyden cared to die . ( To be concluded )
