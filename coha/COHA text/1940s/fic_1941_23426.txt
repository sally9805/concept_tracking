OVER THE BROW OF THE HILL A STORY BY JOHN MACLIESH The author of this story , a Captain in the King 's Own Royal Regiment , died on the Libyan Frontier , aged twenty-two , and is buried there in an oasis . The manuscript was found among his papers. ? The Editors . F OR what seemed to him a long time he lay in a state of painful throbbing semi-consciousness . A stinging soreness started from behind his eyes and permeated his whole body . At the slightest movement a wrench of pain from his leg made all his nerves shiver . The sun was shining warmly on his face now . It had been dark when he first opened his eyes . The air was cool . The little breeze that fanned him bore with it a fragrance that was new to him . He did not open his eyes because he was afraid of the light . Gradually he fell into a sleep of uneasy whispy dreaming , haunted by a feeling of some unknown responsibility unfulfilled , and all the while conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added to those that already were afflicting him . At first scarcely noticed , it grew in intensity , until eventually he realized that the sun was blazing hotly on his face and neck . The cool fragrance of the breeze had given place to a choking dusty oppression . After a few feeble efforts to shield himself with his arms and hands he opened his eyes . The first thing he saw was a big gray bird circling easily above him with scarcely a movement of its wings . From time to time it uttered a dry little croak . He watched it , troubled by some oddfamiliarity about it . Not to other birds of its kind , but to something else . Something remembered dimly , and yet elusive , like a turned-away face . With difficulty he raised himself on his elbow and looked dazedly around . In front of him a succession of low round sand hills curved away smoothly into the hot dimness of the distance . Their outlines danced in the surges of hot air that shimmered across the ground . There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully a minute and then , with a pitiful expression of incredulity on his face , turned to look round the other way . He found that he was lying at the foot of a fairly large sand hill , whose long ruffled crest prevented him from seeing for more than a hundred yards . About ten yards from him the wreckage of an airplane lay upside down in the sand , its crumpled fuselage , upturned wheels , and bent propeller forlorn in their silence . For the moment this sight stirred a dim recollection in his mind , but elusive as a half-remembered name , it slipped through his dull brain , leaving only the picture of an airplane glinting meaninglessly in the sun and casting a shapeless shadow on the sand . He sighed and lay down again , exhausted by the effort . But it soon became clear to him that he would have to move . Each minute the sun more fiercely , blazing with the increased glare from the burning sand . About the horizon successive waves of heat were setting into the dull shivering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawl over to the shade beneath the wreckage . The movement did not hurt his leg as much as he had expected , but each time he made any progress forward the sand slipped from under him , till he could have screamed with exasperation . When at length he reached the wreckage his head throbbed with pain . He was soaked with sweat . His tongue was dry . The smell of oil that had dripped from the engine into a dark shiny pool , and was being slowly absorbed into the sand around its edges , brought that sour taste that presages sickness into his mouth . Cold prickly perspiration broke out on his forehead . After a fcw moments of doubtful anticipation he was sick . Feeling better for it , he crawled away from the patch of oil and made a hollow for himself in the sand with his shoulders and lay back . The sickness had cleared his head . It ached no longer . With the cessation of the pain behind his eyes some of the soreness about his person subsided . He began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ littered with things that had fallen from the cockpit . There was a notebook with a pencil tied to it on a piece of string . A pair of splintered goggles . Some gloves . The leather cushion from the pilot 's seat . There was a pistol in a leather holster . It was when he leaned over to pull the cushion under his head that he first noticed the pistol . Up to that moment his mind had been kept so busily occupied with the series of facts with which it had been confronted that he had not considered the possibility of death . Now he found himself wondering almost subconsciously how soon he would be driven by thirst to use the pistol . ; Fought94 w dawned on him a feeling of cold uneasiness started in his stomach and spread through all his body . Death ! With his chin rested on his fist , he stared at the thing lying there , cruel , black , efficient , in the sand . How strange it was , he thought , that anything so small should be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn him in a flash from a living thing , full of energy and aspiration , into a pale twisted mass of decay . His overcharged imagination traced the successive stages of his own gradual destruction . The big gray bird would hear the shot and come swiftly down to investigate then , croaking with anticipation and self-righteousness , hasten off to spread the glad news amongst his comrades . He visualized their arrival , at first silent , with only circling shadows on the sand and a faint sound of beating wings . Then , suddenly swooping down , a violent , seething , quarreling mass , pecking , tearing , hopping , and fluttering off to swallow some ghastly tidbit quickly , so as to be able to return , beady-eyed and avid , for more . He saw them , their banquet over , preening themselves about the pink freshness of his newly uncovered bones , and then flying off heavily , one by one , satisfied and sleepy , leaving the completion of nature 's sanitary task to the wind , the sun , and the sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beetle or some other small tenant might find a homc in his skull and rear a family there . And now there came back to him , in dreamlike fantasy , pictures he had seen in his childhood , in children 's books , of various outlandish creatures living in pumpkins or similar lodgings , garnished for domestic purposes with a chimney . Possibly even thatched . It seemed entirely reasonable that his skull might serve the purpose equally well . Desirable residences must be difficult in those parts to come by . He hoped it would be a beetle . In his youth he had had a great affection for them and for all small helpless things . He remembered a cockchafer he had kept in a box . He used to take it out for walks on a piece of cotton . There had been bumblebees too that lived in a tin with muslin over the top . He had brewed for their benefit a beverage he remembered calling Nutmegale . . . . Good friends all , they had been , and he liked to think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . He found himself wondering where the new tenant would find materials for its improvements and its alterations in this barren place . And now the path of memory led him finally back into his childhood , down a narrow path roughly trodden by grownup feet , to a hole in some paling . Clear-cut as a picture it was . He had only to put his two hands on the sides of the hole , to steady himself , and to step through , and there he was . A square little boy in blue rompers again , with a black bullet head . It was somewhere on the east coast of Scotland . He had lived there in a house with his grandmother while his parents had been abroad in India . He remembered that . The gap in the paling had been down at the bottom of the vegetable garden ; through it the little path ran , worn in the grass of a field that led down to , and under , the railway embankment . There was a dark , cool , echoing bridge there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He remembered that . Rounding the bend , you suddenly saw the sea far below . Choppy little waves casting dazzle stars of fiery sunlight from the crest of one to the crest of another . As you went on round the path a wonderful view of caves unfolded itself behind the shoulder of a grassy mound on which sea pinks trembled in the breeze . The rock in one place had been eaten away , leaving only a thin craggy sort of pier that curved up into a big crooked arch . Around it , and around the cliffs of the bay , the sea swelled and surged lazily , from time to time casting up a spout of spray like a fountain of scattered sunlit snow . Then the water subsided with widening creamy rings of foam , swung slowly back , and gathering its wrinkled mass , made another languid onslaught . The voice of the sea he remembered too as if it reached his ears from very far away . It had been a wonderful thing to him , a great sound made up of many smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shingle . The cold echoing slap as they beat against the smooth walls of caves . The melancholy oft-repeated cry of a single gull , snatched away and made faint by the wind , then taken up by gulls all round the shore as they rose in white circling masses , flashed in the sun , and settled again  --  some on the cliffs , some on the waves to be rocked up and down , sideways and down , up and down  --  and sideways and down . And now , from the pleasant coma into which memory had lulled him , there came a particular day . A particular sea gull . The sun was shining . In the house a grown-up made whirring sounds on a sewing machine . His sisters played tedious games with dolls under a mulberry tree . He left them . He left the lot of them and went through that hole in the paling , for the first time in his short life all alone . The currant bushes were a forest . The gorse was a jungle . The rough path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick Whittington trod . Through the field he went and under the railway arch . It was out of bounds . It was strictly forbidden , and that was the joy of it and the delight . Now he was all alone , out on the cliffs . The sea wind ruffled his hair . And to him , over the grass amongst the sea pinks , came Tutu . Tutu had been a half-witted boy from the village . A shambling , dirty , uncouth boy , always hungry , always looking for something to cook . His eye was beady and furtive . He spoke with an odd little dry croak . So oddly familiar now . . . . In a minute , he thought , I shall see . I shall remember . THE INCIDENT IN JAMES STREET TWENTY-SIX HOURS AS AN AIR RAID WARDEN BY JOHN STRACHEY T FIVE minutes to seven on a Friday evening Ford was getting into his overalls when the Blitz began , noisily . He put on his tin hat and went to the door to have a look out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without eating his dinner , which was ready . As he put his head out , a man said " Warden , " out of the dark . " Warden , " went on the voice irritably , " come and see these dreadful lights . Do n't you think you ought to put them out at once ? " Ford went down the street a few yards and found a man in a trilby hat pointing toward the trees in Bedford Court . There were the lights all right , two of them behind the trees and , as they watched , three more came slowly drifting and dropping through the higher sky , red , white , and orange . " I 'm afraid I ca n't put those lights out , " Ford said . " You see , those are flares dropped from German airplanes . " " Oh , are they ? " said the man ; his voice was still censorious . The ' plane droned lower and lower . The guns thumped , spat , and crashed . " Do n't you think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " Ford said . But he failed to complete his sentence . A swish had begun . He dropped like a stone , full length into the gutter . The man in the trilby hat took no notice whatever , either of the swish or of the disappearance of his interlocutor . He began explaining how he had always said that the " best way to deal with them ' Uns . . . " Ford , however , listening , his ear very much to the ground , heard the swish end in a thud without a bang . He thought , " D.A . and near . " So the war plans of the man in the trilby hat passed , literally , over his head . Ford picked himself up ; another swish began . Something in its note seemed to him menacing . He flung open the area gate and had crashed down the steps by the time this swish ended , with what then seemed to be a loud bang ( although a little later he was to think of it as having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area  --  he hoped with dignity  --  he found the man in the trilby hat still explaining his own method of bombing Berlin . He had apparently again not noticed that he had been speaking to the blackout alone . Ford heard , not very loud , but unmistakably , the tinkle of falling glass and the cracking of broken masonry . The man , apparently disgusted at this warden 's inattention , remarked , " Well , I must be going on now , " and passed into the night . Ford began to run . He ran in what he thought was the direction of the noises , along Marlow Square , past the sub-post , deciding ( probably wrongly ) not to go in and report first , but to go straight for the incident . It did not cross his mind that there could be any difficulty in finding it . Nor did there seem to be . He ran into Gage Street , crossed Royal Walk and the top of James Street , which he glanced down . It touched his plowland of the distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fading violet of the dusk was gathering about the fragile outlines of the Judean hills and creeping gradually up the soft blue of the cloudless sky . The air was filled with the scent of the blossoming orange trees . Everything was still . This was the best hour of all the day , and Abdul Al stood for a moment savoring it , the wind parting his beard . From the village came the shrill sound of boys at play . From his own house in the grove came the shriller note of his wives quarreling . An unseen donkey bemoaned its fate . Abdul looked round him , suddenly aware of something missing . It was then that he noticed that Yusseff , his son , his last born , who had come out with him to the grove that evening at the hour of the watering , was no longer there . " Yusseff ? " He cocked his head sideways , listening for a reply , but none came . Then he saw that there was a hole in the fencing around the orange grove , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the sand . " So soon , " thought Abdul , " he seeks adventure , the little one ! " He laughed into the folds of his beard and set out to seek his son . The desert is no place for children , after sunset . Presently he saw his son 's Tom Thumblike little figure , clad in its black-andwhite-striped pillowcase of a smock , plodding along far ahead at the foot of the sand hills . . . . It would be amusing to see where he would go , the little one . Abdul kept his distance , tolerantly following . Yusseff mounted the slope and stood for a moment , thumb in mouth , watching the sun disappear . He wondered whereit spent the night . When it had gone he started to climb the hill . Perhaps if he reached the top he would see it , a golden penny , lying flat in the sand . To get to the top was a pioneer effort for him . He had never before ventured so far afield . The fence of the orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . Neither his short legs nor his small feet were fitted to cope with the heavy embrace of the sand . But get to the top he did . Then he saw something that aroused his curiosity . He advanced toward it . When he was only a few yards away he stopped to stare at the strange motionless figure in the sand . As he did so , a large gray bird that sat as if awaiting a signal gave . a croak and withdrew a little way . Yusseff had a lively contempt for such birds . He picked up a piece of stick and made a sortie at it . It rose and moved off a little way with spread wings and settled again . The child stood for some time , his close-cropped head on one side , his thumb in his mouth , small body swaying slightly as though blown by the wind . His black glistening eyes flickered about trying to take it all in , trying to understand what it meant . Half frightened he was and yet fascinated . Presently he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the still figure with his stick . " Saida ! " he said . The figure stirred . The lips moved framing a word that Yusseff did not understand . " Water . Water . " The child turned , his brief spell of courage ebbing . Now the quiet of the evening was broken up by the voice of Yusseff , calling , calling for his father , as Abdul Al came over the brow of the hill .
