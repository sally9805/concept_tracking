War seemed good to the Athenians that first day . It was like a holiday . Because of air-raid alarms the shops were closed . <P> Bands of enthusiasts walked the streets shouting lusty jests , sticking their thumbs up , singing songs , crying the ancient boast : " We will throw them into the sea . " They laughed about the macaroni-men from macaroni-land , trying to be warriors . <P> The people cheered when they heard what the Generalissimo , Alexander Papagos , had said : " We will write new , glorious pages in our history , and do not doubt that we will win our cause . " The people were gay when they read on walls the slogans of Premier John Metaxas : " Only pessimistic peoples disappear ! Greeks , be optimists ! " They trooped to the British Legation , waving the Union Jack beside the blue &; white flag of Greece . They cheered until Britain 's tall , immaculate Minister Sir Charles Michael Palairet came out on the balcony . Some among them retold the old saw about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was found hours later with his leg broken , his monocle still in place . Just like the plucky British , they said . <P> They rushed on to the Turkish Embassy , and waved the crescent &; star beside those other two fine flags . It was the Turkish Republic 's 17th birthday , and they had heard that in Ankara the paper Ulus had said : " We prefer the hell of war to a dishonorable peace . " Just like the stubborn Turks , they said . <P> When they saw King George II driving out in his uniform of Supreme Commander , they cheered and wept . When they looked out across the city to the heights where the ancient temple columns stood in rows like sturdy fighting men , they were proud to be Greeks . <P> Even on the second day , war was almost fun . It was thrilling to see every taxi , truck , cart , bus and private auto in the town bumping off over the rough road that leads to Thebes and the fighting fronts north and west-vehicles carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a lark to hear that 20 British aviators who had been interned when their planes landed in Greece were now released ; and to carry them through the streets like heroes . It was stirring to crowd into Constitution Square before the Htel de la Grande-Bretagne to cheer King George emerging from the palace opposite . It was moving to learn that Venizelist officers disgraced in the revolt of 1935 had now pleaded to be sent to the front ; and to learn that foreigners , especially Greek-Americans , were signing up : men like 36-year-old John Theotocki , a hash king from Kansas City , who said : " We cleaned up the gangsters in the United States and now we 've got a tougher job here . " But when the Athenians heard that the Italians had sent their bombers over other Greek cities , that Greek women and children had perished , war was not such fun . <P> When they considered the odds , when they learned that the Yugoslavs could not help the Greeks unless the Turks did and the Turks would not move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how little practical support the British could give , they were grave . They gathered in coffee houses and drank thick Turkish coffee and sipped their ouzo , as colorless and full of kick as corn likker . <P> And they talked . Every man gave his opinion , every man was an amateur oracle .
