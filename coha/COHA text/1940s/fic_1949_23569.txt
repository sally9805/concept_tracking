The Best Bread A Story by Bentz Plagemann Illustrated by John Grath T HERE were nine Branwells in their house on a mountain top in the North Carolina Appalachians . It is of Molly , the eldest daughter , that I wish to write , but I find it impossible to see her apart from her family . Indeed , to attempt to do so would be unfair . They stood about her protectively , with an instinct deeper than the mind , such as might prompt creatures of the wood to conceal one stricken of their own . But the comparison may be misleading . They were mountain people , it is true , and unworldly , but they were neither simpler nor more complex than you or I. When I said to Adam Branwell , the father , for example , that farming on top of a mountain must be difficult , he smiled and said that they liked the view . " And we are safe from the atomic bomb , " he added . He pronounced the word atomic differently than we did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is correct , I reasoned ; after all the Branwells had , in their way of speech , a noble precedent . Their people had lived in these mountains since the middle of the seventeenth century . Scholars said it was still possible to trace influences of Elizabethan English in their idiom . Adam Branwell was a tall . spare man in his fifties . In repose his face had something of that grandeur which life in the wilderness imparts . Lincoln had such a face , and he , like Adam Branwell , was a man easy to caricature . I think it was this quality which promptedour Southern friends to caution us when we went to spend the summer in a cabin deep in the North Carolina hills . The mountain people are kind , a letter told us , and we might persuade them to help us in necessary ways , such as in cutting wood , or the bringing in of supplies , but we must not patronize them , or regard them as lesser people . We had been surprised at this . Our concern had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard us as lesser people , but when our son first saw Mr. Bran-well he said , " Oh , a hill-billy . " Then we knew what our friends had meant . We asked Brent , our son , to wait in his judgment . We asked him to be silent and to watch with his eyes , and perhaps he might learn something from Mr. Branwell . He might , if he had any wisdom in his twelveyear-old head , learn to respect him . But we spoke rhetorically , I think now . All or us learned from Mr. Branwell , and our respect gained substance and was translated into human terms , - but we had to overcome our own handicap of chewing tobacco and overalls , just as Brent had to learn to see Mr. Branwell outside of the comic book . Mr. Branwell had shown himself to us first in his most vulnerable light , as if to test our understanding . He came to us almost drunk , with a Mason jar of corn whisky in the pocket of his overalls . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he waited until my wife had left the room to put the boy to bed before he offered me a drink . " It is mountain dew , " he said with a wink . I asked him to wait until she returned . " She needs a drink , " I said . " We traveled far today . And she has never tasted mountain dew either . " I admit I was rather concerned about his visit . It was dark and we were alone in a strange land with only the light of the kerosene lamps and the burning log in the fireplace to show us the outline of Mr. Branwell , tall and uncouth in his overalls , his black hat at his feet , his tobacco stained teeth revealed in a smile . But my wife was not alarmed . With her when she carne back into the room she brought some woman 's magic , and all at once we were not strangers before a fire , but a man and his wife in a new home to which a neighbor had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had brought us , in kitchen glasses , and when our eyes smarted at its potency , Mr. Branwell rose to demonstrate it further . On the hearthstone of our borrowed cabin he poured a small amount and put a match to it . Limpid blue flames danced above its surface . Afterward we said it was then Mr. Branwell had dedicated our cabin . He had made it our home . And then he talked . " I take the Charlotte Observer because it has the best foreign news , " he said . And , - Bear fat makes the best bread . Ma always used bear grease when she baked . " He said , " Dewey is not politician enough to be in the White House . Even a good.man has to be a politician to be President . " And , " You must learn to know the touch-me-not which grows along the branches . You put the leaves in sweet milk and pour it down the dog 's throat when a rattler strikes him . " And finally , " On our mountain we raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are safe from the atom-ic bomb . " I T RAINED all that night . It had rained all the day before , the day we arrived , and on the following morning the trout stream which tumbled by our door rose high enough to carry away our foot-bridge with a noise like a tree falling . We were halfway up the mountain on which the Branwells lived , and our car was on the other side of the stream . " We wanted to be isolated , " I said as we stood on the front porch watching the rain , watching the distant mountains dissolve and reappear , like a series of Japanese prints in which almost nothing can he seen but mist . Suddenly there was a hallo on the steep narrow path which led down to us from the Branwells and while we watched a row of figures emerged in single file from the rhododendron . First was Mr. Branwell . After him came a girl of about seventeen , after her three small children . Each carried something in his hands , and a dog brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the porch and put their burdens down . They had brought us two freshly-killed dressed broilers , a gallon of fresh milk , a pound of newly-churned butter , corn , string beans , squash , onions . " It will help you until you get to the store , " Mr. Branwell said . " When the rain stops I will bring down Prince , my horse , and pull the foot-log back across the branch . " Gratitude is difficult . Particularly if it is felt deeply in the heart . And we were baffled , remembering our friend 's letter . Were we to pay for these things ? Sometimes the only way is to ask . And so while we sat together on the porch , echoing our thanks , I did just that . " Can we pay you for this ? " I asked , hesitating over the words . Their composure banished our indecision . " We brought these things to you , " the girl said . " But you can buy things from us after this , if you like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our callers . The young girl was Mary , youngest daughter of the family , unmarried ; the children were those of her sisters . The small girl with the lovely pensive face , wearing a Kate Greenaway pinafore , and a Kate Greenaway expression , was the daughter and only child of one sister , Martha . The two boys Henry and " Tiny " were the sons of another daughter , Molly . And then there was the dog . I did not recognize his breed . He had thick hair , gray and curly , and a blunt muzzle and dark eyes . In the shy silence of the front porch I sought him as a topic of conversation and I noticed that as he lay with his eyes open his legs twitched , and every now and then a strong tremor passed through his body . " Is he ill ? " I asked . " Why does he tremble ? " " He is a psycho-neurotic dog , " Mr. Bran-well said . I thought I had not heard him correctly and I looked at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the veterans ' hospital , " Mr. Branwell said . I said , " Oh , " as if I were thoroughly familiar with psycho-neurotic dogs from veterans ' hospitals , but the bewilderment must have remained in my face because Mr. Bran-well explained further . " The hospital is five miles over the hills , " he said . " Bully  --  we call the dog Bully  --  came over one time with some friends of Molly 's husband , and since then he comes to see us every once in a while . He was mascot for a group of flyers . He does n't speak English . " " He does n't ? " I asked . " At first we thought he was deaf , " Mr. Branwell said , " but then afterwards we realized he was a foreign dog and did n't speak our language . " Molly 's husband was killed in the war , " Mr. Branwell added . There is nothing to say to that , and we said nothing . " These arc his sons , " Mr. Branwell explained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Tiny here . Tiny 's a mean one . " From his tone and the expression on his face I gathered that the word was spoken in affection , with a different meaning from the one we applied to it . Tiny had found the rocking chair on our porch and with feet extended he was now busily occupied in rocking back and forth as violently as he could . He smiled broadly , showing pink gums and ' white , little-boy 's teeth , but in that smile you could see the man that he would be , and the man that his father was . " He calls me Pa , " Mr. Branwell said . " He 's a mean one . He gets mad , just like that . Sometimes you do n't even know why . And then he goes into the parlor and sits in his rocking chair and rocks . It 's an old chair and we were going to throw it out , but Ma says it 's his chair now and he can have it . " Tiny smiled . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ran his gnarled hand softly over the uneasy haunches . " I could pet him to death , " he said , without looking up . W lilLE the stream was high , Thomas Branwell came down to fish for trout . He looked like his father , and he dressed like him in overalls , and in his pocket along with his can of fishing worms he carried a plug of chewing tobacco . He was twenty-five , and he was a little boy . You do n't need to worry about Tommy , " Mr. Branwell had told us , as something of an afterthought , when they had started back up the hill the day before . " He was sick when he was little . They say it was meningitis , and his mind never grew up after that . But he 's a good boy . He wo n't hurt nobody . " Our son found that out for himself . We had forgotten to tell him about Tommy , and he had not heard about him because he had gone from the porch before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the stream . And when Tommy came down to fish we found them together , sitting back on their heels , like Rousseau 's noble savages . Tommy fished and Brent watched . " Like to fish ? " I asked Tommy . " Yep . " " Catch anything ? " " Nope . " After that the conversation died . It might have been easier to make a further attempt if Tommy had n't turned to look at me every time I spoke . His eyes were mild and clear and incredibly blue , but they were intimidating bcause they were so pure . I had once seen a deer with eyes like that . He had been born and raised in a game preserve and he had never heard the hunter 's gun . ( " I like Tommy , " my son said later . " He 's fun to be with . He always smiles . " ) Tommy 's fishing technique was something to watch . He carried his worms in a Prince Albert tobacco can in his rear overall pocket . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , reach for the tobacco can , extract a worm , and then he would hang it over the hook until he had achieved a nice balance . Back into the stream went the line . In a moment he would pull out the empty hook again , shake his head , reach for the tobacco can , etc . In this sort of friendly fishing , in which neither worm nor fish are disturbed , there is , eventually , an end to the worms , and when he had reached this , Tommy threw away his tobacco can , searched for flat stones where he sat , and practiced skipping them in the water . He skipped one stone nine times before it reached the opposite bank . Brent was rightly impressed . " Tommy 's a good boy , " the voice of Mr. Branwell said behind me . I had been so interested I had not heard him approach . He had come with Prince , to pull the foot-logback from the side of the stream where the current had left it . The great , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reason that I could explain . He looked as if he had been placed there by Picasso , in a collage , perhaps . to achieve a disturbing sense of juxtaposition . But no one else thought it strange . Tommy arose to help . and he was a good assistant who spoke little and cheerfully obeyed instructions . They worked slowly and well , MI . Branwell , Tommy ? and Prince , entertaining us with a running conversation . " Tommy wo n't drink beer no more , " Mr. Branwell said , laughing . " Nope , " Tommy said , emphatically shaking his head , bracing the log which Prince would pull across the stream . " I had him in town , " Mr. Branwell said , " and before I knew what was happening-1 was talking with neighbors , you know  --  they had bought him three glasses of beer . Had to hold his head while he threw up . Old lady gave me hell when I brought him home . ' Getting our son drunk , ' she said . Tommy wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , smiling , shaking his head . Mr. Branwell smiled too , and suddenly I saw him in the round , as now and again we are privileged to see another man , by some sense generally submerged . In his smile as he looked at his son was the same protective kindness which I had seen when he looked at Bully the dog , and at Tiny his fatherless grandson . It was there also when he looked at me where I stood by the stream , leaning on my son and my cane , unable , because of my war-time injury , to help . W HEN the bridge was up the world was ours again , and we went on Sunday to have dinner with the Branwells . We had to drive down through old stream beds to do it , and around the base of the mountain , and start up from the bottom on the other side where the Branwells had their road . After we reached the top I realized that my neck was so stiff from strain that I could scarcely turn it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which circled a mountain , so that at every turn there was nothing ahead of the car but space . Stones rattled away under the tires and sometimes the car skittered nerv-ously over loose gravel . It was a road on which you dared not hestitate and could not turn back and you had a curious sense that the normal landscape had unaccountably tilted up , because you passed cows grazing in perpendicular pastures , and corn growing in neat rows at a forty-five degree angle . At last we came to a clearing near the top , and there was the Branwell house , rising up on a stone base , with a tin roof slanting down over dark-stained batten board . The scene was like a diorama in a museum , cunningly contrived to operate with hidden wheels . Chickens ran helter-skelter from the car . dogs barked , and from his pen the pig groaned . Wood smoke arose lazily from the chimney , ascending upward into limitless space , and all around as far as the eye could see stretched the mountains as God had made them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deliberately , and Tiny , running , the other children in shy eagerness . Mrs. Bran-well stood framed in her doorway with her hands folded in her apron . There is a woman like her in every family , preserved in memory , perhaps , or in a dim daguerreotype . She had a mother's-face , and when afterward I had studied it long enough at discreet intervals I knew what brought my eyes back to it . It was a round face , and soft ; there were no lines in it yet , but the eyes held , like a mirror , the hope and sadness and questioning of life . They were quiet . and they were so innocent that one knew the end of the world was a long way off , but there was no resignation in them . No challenge . either ; an acceptance , and a belief that someday still the answer to everything might he made known to her . " I declare , " she said , " I meant to come to see you long before this . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with beans to can , and tomatoes , and the cows to be milked every day . " We went into the living room and sat down . We met Martha , the little girl 's mother , whose husband was gone away somewhere , and Molly , the girl whose husband had been killed in the war . Everyone was rather quiet , from shyness we thought ; not until after dinner did we understand what presence lay in the room . We had , as Mrs. Branwell explained , a simple country dinner . There was sausage , homemade , and meat loaf , and a large platter of fried chicken . There was macaroni baked with cheese , and mashed potatoes , and hot biscuits . There were garden beans , and sliced tomatoes , and corn on the cob , pickled cucumbers , and fried okra . There was cake and there was pie , and there were pitchers of milk for those who did not like coffee , and for any unfilled corners there was homemade jelly to eat with fresh bread . Afterward , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Branwell told us what occupied their minds . Molly was not in the room ; she had gone into the kitchen to wash the dishes , and with a glance in that direction to make certain that she would not be overheard , Mrs. Branwell told us they had received word that Molly 's husband 's body had been sent back from overseas . It was . in fact , in New York City , and it was now only a matter of days before it would arrive in North Carolina . Mr. Branwell shook his head . When he spoke we could tell From the expression of his voice that he was repeating an opinion which he had stated often before . " It is a mistake , " he said . " The boy should lie where he fell . And how will . we know it is his body in that sealed coffin ? How will we know there is anything in it at all ? " I HASTENED to report that from my own past observation I knew that the graves registration corps was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You may be assured it is he , " I said , with all the emphasis I could muster . Mr. Bran well still shook his head . " It is n't good , " he said ; " It stirs up old feelings . " Here Mrs. Branwell spoke up . " Tiny , " she said . pointing to the small , smiling figure , even now rocking violently in his own chair , his sturdy little legs stuck out in front of him , " was horn on one day , and the telegram came the next . " " Had I been there , " Mr. Branwell said firmly , " she would not have had the telegram . They brought it to her in the hospital . " " They said it was orders , " Mrs. Branwell said mildly , the look of innocent questioning even stronger in her eyes . " They said it had to be delivered in person . " She paused . " Molly has n't had a well day since . " she said . " And she wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , " Mrs. Branwell said . " It was her wish . " Molly came into the room at this moment and she heard what we were talking about . " We have to be ready , " she said . " He may be here any clay . We have to go to the cemetery . " I spoke then rather tactlessly the question that was in my mind . " Why did you want him brought home ? " 1 asked . " For the boys , " she said , without hesitation . " The oldest does n't remember him , and Tiny never saw him . When they are grown up I can take them to the cemetery and I can say to them , there is your father . " As I met her clear eyes I reversed my conviction about such things . " Yes , " I said , " I think he would like to be brought home . I think he would like to lie here in the hills he had always known . " B EFORE we left their house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional , helpless way one says such things , that if there was anything we might do to help them they must not hesitate to call upon us . When such a thing is said among the people I have always known it is generally accepted in the manner of its delivery , as a sort of coinage of kindness . But the next morning Mary Branwell came down the mountain with a message from her mother . Since I had been good enough to offer my services , would I drive them to the cemetery so they might clear a place for his grave ? I would indeed . I would feel honored to do so . It touched me to be taken into their lives , for there were others in the hills with cars or wagons . kin , or neighbors long known . I drove , at the appointed time , down through the stream beds and around the base of the mountain , but when I came to the perilous road they were waiting for me at the bottom . They had walked all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . Mrs. Branwell and Molly wore bright-printed house dresses . Mrs. Branwell carried , with a smile . an old hat of her husband 's , to protect her from the sun . In his hand , Mr. Branwell carried the tools . He had brought a hand scythe and a hedge clippersand we put these in the back of the car . It was a bright day and we drove back into the mountains with an unaccountable feeling of holiday . The cemetery lay some ten miles distant ; away from the highway , where the older people had lived . It seemed , as we drove , not so much a passage of miles as a journey backward into time . The Bran-wells pointed out to each other with delight certain familiar landmarks . Aunt Jessie had lived there . for example , and down that road old Mr. Cooney used to walk in the evening on his cane , to catch a breath of air and talk with the neighbors at the store . The houses here were more as I had imagined the houses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of familiarity about them , with their verandahs supported . by thin poles , the stone spring-houses covered with creepers , the pink mimosa and lilac and myrtle in the yards . They struck a responsive chord in the memory as if always in dreams one had been a child here in a world firmly defined by staunch elders , a world which would always exist unchanged here in the valleys , away from the paved roads , and the soft-drink signs , and the tremulous uncertainty of time . At length we came to the cemetery . The road into it was impassable , rains having deepened the heavy indentures of hearse wheels , so we took to the open pasture and drove across it toward the grove of dark pines before which the tilted grave markers were discernible in a tangle of briars and weeds . When we drove as near as we could approach we got out of the car , Mr. Branwell carrying the clearing tools , and made our way into the tangle among the stones . Only a few of these grave markers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legends had been obliterated by time had never been anything else , I was told , but rude markers , and now that the men who had placed them were dead , and those who had been present when it was done were gone , no one knew who lay beneath . It was true that here and there were conventional monuments from the stone-cutter 's yard , bearing names and dates , and sometimes a few words . The stone on the grave of Mrs. Branwell 's mother , for example , explained sorrowfully that " the joy of our home has left us . " But I was not to be deceived into thinking that where she lay was new burial ground . " Every time they dig a grave here , " Mrs. Branwell said , " they uncover others . " This bothered them ; they did not like to disturb the rest of the dead , but one was buried here where one 's fathers had been buried , and if an early grave was uncovered inadvertently , then it was reverently closed and another spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead are , " Mrs. Bran-well said , " although we think that some are Indians who were friends of the early people . " We were standing , as we talked , at the edge of the Branwell plot ; our job was to choose the spot where Molly 's husband would lie , and clear that , and mark it with a stake , which Mr. Branwell now cut from a nearby tree , and then old friends would come in and dig and make it ready . " We 'd better clear a path , too , " Mrs. Bran-well said , " because the Legion Post is going to send some boys with a bugle , and there will be both families , too , to stand here . " They set to work . Mr. Branwell wielded the scythe , and Mrs. Branwell , her husband 's old hat on her head , went to work with the clippers to clear away the vines and brambles which would slip away from the scythe 's blade . They were clearing generally at first and Molly stood at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here is old Mr. Lampion and his little colored boy , " Mrs. Branwell said , pointing with the clippers . " We must not dig here , and over there by Mama are eight graves , but there is room there , anyway , Molly , if you want him to be near the family . " I turned my head away . Some family moments are too intimate for the presence of a stranger , and although they seemed to have forgotten me , temporarily , I wished that I might have been anywhere else but where I was . I turned toward the pine grove which fell away behind the cemetery , cool and silent , so closely grown that the trees branched only at some height , and looked at the distant mountains through the tall , dark trunks . Molly 's voice was clear and light when she answered . It jarred oddly on the ears , as the cry of a child in the night does , or the voice of delirium in the sick room . " I want him over in that corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to myself , so that I can do anything I want with the grave . " W IIEN they had cleared the corner spot and marked it with the stake , and cleared about it a place for the mourners to stand , we returned to the car and drove away , out of the past and of memory , into the present . The sun was very hot now and beside me Mr. Branwell wiped the moisture of his exertion from his face and Mrs. Branwell fanned herself with the old hat , where she sat in the back seat beside Molly . We talked a little , quietly , as people do when not to talk is a dangerous thing . When we reached the foot of the mountain they would not allow me to drive them up , even though I insisted . " We will bring the cows in on the way , " Mrs. Branwell said . They thanked me , almost too much , I thought . For some reason I could not understand I was almost offended by their gratitude . " Say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then I drove away with the feeling one sometimes has that the episode was incomplete , that none of us had been able to conclude it with a remark that might have given it meaning . I went on to our house thoughtfully , hoping that in conversation with my wife I might resolve this feeling and give the day shape . She was in the kitchen , cooking our supper at the wood range , but while we talked Brent came in to say that Mr. Branwell was on the front porch . " He wants to see you , " he said . There was a gravity in Brent 's manner which suggested that if he did not prepare me for it I might not arise to the demands of ? special occasion . I went to the door and found Mr. Branwell sitting heavily on the front steps of the porch . I was relieved to see that he had a Mason jar of mountain dew with him and I took a drink gratefully . We sat together for a while in silence . I wondered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could well understand , but rather what had brought him down the mountain so soon after seeing him . Then he said , " They do n't like me to drink , " and I began to understand a little . " Who does n't like you to drink ? " I asked . " My wife , the girls , " he said . He was already a little drunk . But then it is very easy to get drunk in the sunlight at that altitude , especially on mountain dew . " They say it is n't Christian , " he said , They do ? " I asked- And it occurred to me how I might come to his defense , or offer him a defense for his own use . I felt it was very clever of me . " In the Bible , " I said , " Jesus turned water into wine at the marriage feast at Cana . And wine of the very best quality , too . " M R- BRANWELL shook his head . It was evident he had been presented with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was only wine , " he said . " It says nothing in the Bible about strong spirits . " We sat in silence a while longer . I sensed then that Mr. Branwell had come not only to share his drink with me , but also , and even though 1 was alien to him in many ways , because I was a man , and there arc ' times when a mart wants to be with another man , especially if he spends his life with women and children , and a grown son who is only a boy . " It is n't that I 'm not a religious man , " he said at length , his thoughts traveling some path opened to him by the liquor . " I. believe in God . But this preacher , now , at the church where the women go . I 've known him all my life . He was a mean one when he was young . He 's got more than one bastard in this county . And then he was saved , youknow . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a preacher . He just had the call . But when I go to be talked to about God , I feel that I ought to go to a man wiser than myself . " As I turned to look at him , seeing the unmasked mortality in his eyes , I knew all at once why the gratitude of Molly and her mother had troubled me- It was because I felt they did not know where their true indebtedness lay ; that familiarity had blinded them to the magnitude of this man . They did not seem to realize that only he stood between them , between Tommy , and Molly , and her fatherless sons , and the world . But I could not say this ; / could not even say what the mountain dew prompted me to say , that perhaps a man wiser than himself would be difficult to find . Something other than natural reticence held me hack , however , some subconscious feeling that in a world where so few men fulfill themselves he must have his own reward . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense . " Sometimes we can only help ourselves , " he said , drinking again from the Mason jar and wiping his mouth on his sleeve . " Like Molly , for instance . It will take time . But I will bring her out of her darkness . "
