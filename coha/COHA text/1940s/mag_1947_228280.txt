Decrying the old family doctor is a fashionable medical pastime . Of the 170,000 U.S. physicians , more than half ( 55% ) are now classed as specialists-and the specialist class is growing . Only last fortnight , Dean Willard C. Rappleye of Columbia University 's School of Medicine predicted that group practice in community hospitals will eventually do away with the independent general practitioner . Said Dr. Rappleye : " Medical knowledge is now so complex . . . that . . . complete medical service can no longer be rendered by an individual physician alone . " <P> But the general run of people still believe that the old family doctor has his points . And last week the No. 1 U.S. medical publishing house placed a sizable bet on the general practitioner 's future : a five-volume , monumental compendium of modern medical knowledge ( An Integrated Practice of Medicine , W. B. Saunders Co. , $50 ) . Its aim : to make the family doctor an up-to-date , " compleat practitioner . " <P> The author of this work , which the publishers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom 's Cabin , is Dr. Harold Thomas Hyman , a top Manhattan physician and longtime Columbia pharmacology professor . A general practitioner himself , whose interests range from psychoanalysis to syphilis ( TIME , April 22 , 1940 ) , Dr. Hyman was spurred by a deep conviction that medicine is an art as well as a science . He and a group of specialists spent six years compiling the five volumes . <P> Subdivided Patients . Dr. Hyman admits that , through specialization , medicine has become " disintegrated , dehumanized and depersonalized , to the distress of all concerned . . . . The individual patient has become divided and subdivided until each of his afflicted organs or systems may be under scrutiny by several technicians . . . . <P> " The physician has lost the ' feel ' of the patient 's home . The patient , in turn , has been separated from his ' Doc ' by receptionists , interns , residents , admitting physicians , house-officers , ward assistants , dispensary workers , specialists , subspecialists , nurses , social service workers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility for the human life are the province of no one practitioner . " <P> The Hyman manual leaves to specialists major surgery and the treatment of complicated ailments . But it provides the family doctor with a meticulously illustrated guide for diagnosing and coordinating treatments for almost every human ill . Conveniently indexed so that a doctor can start with symptoms and follow through to the latest approved treatment , it is a shrewd mixture of modern science and common sense . <P> Skillful Neglect . A good family doctor , observes Hyman , possesses two potent assets not to be found in a laboratory : sympathy and reassurance . Large doses of these healing agents , he says , should be carried in every doctor 's kit . Other Hyman hints : <P> " The great majority of human ailments tend towards spontaneous recovery . " A doctor must know when to apply " skillful neglect " ; i.e. , just tell the patient he is going to get well without treatment , or give him a harmless pill . <P> There is no cure for the common cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on nostrums annually if they frankly admitted it .
