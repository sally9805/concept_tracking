Columbia 's fortyish , bouncy Dr. Gene Weltfish , who teaches anthropology ( the science of Man ) , is a woman , but that is not the only reason she is sometimes dubious about man 's future . Like many another scientist ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) , she is shocked by the horrors of a war in which scientific brains were deciding factors . In September 's Scientific Monthly , Dr. Weltfish proposed a professional oath for all scientists , like the Hippocratic Oath which physicians honor : <P> " I pledge that I will use my knowledge for the good of humanity and against the destructive forces of the world and the ruthless intent of men ; and that I will work together with my fellow scientists of whatever nation , creed or color , for these , our common ends . "
