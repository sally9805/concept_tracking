txt POLITICAL AND BUSINESS circles here are surprised at the vehemence of some American criticisms of the British Government 's program for combatting post-war economic slumps . ( This plan envisions , among other things , manipulation of tax and social security systems and capital markets . ) The American reaction contrasts wittt a chorus of approval from the British press . It also is expected that the new policy will receive general endorsement from all political parties when it is debated in Parliament . Right wing commentators breathed a sigh of relief that the proposals are so moderate and do n't envisage any change in the structure of industry or regimentation of private enterprise , beyond " inducements " that industrialists cooperate with the Government in locating new industries and in regulating their capital expenditure according to trade cycles . Left wing critics , on the other hand , would have liked the Government Co lean further toward permanent controls after the end-ofthe-war transitional period and toward replacement of private enterprise by state- , managed production and distribution . Bankers are unperturbed by the Government 's proposals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought here . The Government 's proposals that employers be asked to seek profits through greater efficiency rather than through higher prices and that trade unions be asked to discard restrictive practices which slow down production are considered encouraging signs of the Government 's attitude toward monopoJ lies . These , together with proposals to ensure greater mobility of labor , are welcomed as attempts to check the ossification of British industry . ? ? ? THE GOVERNMENTS PLAN outlines what may be considered the lowest common denominator of agreement on principles which future governments will act on in order to maintain a steady level of purchasing power by the community as a whole . But governments , like businesses . are run by human beings and when it comes to acting on the advice of its experts , will the Government do so quickly enough and will it have the political courage to do such an unpopular thing as checking a boom ? If the Government makes itself directly responsible , there will be no whipping boy on whom the blame can be laid . On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no political- party-id-=Britain would dare - Lei ' seek electoral support without a definite post-war employment policy , and it would seem that the new policy forms a basis which no party can reject , although there will be different emphasis by different , parties on how it should be operated . Current economic theories on measures for checking booms and slumps may not be the " eureka " some young economists enthusiastically imagine , but sonic such policy as sketched in the white paper on post-war employment must be tried out . most people here believe . It is n't proposed to put the policy into operation until after the transitional period which may last three or four years while war-torn Europe is rehabilitated and reconstructed . ? ? ? THE NATIONAL DEBT in Britain topped $80 billion last month and is likely to reach $100 billion before the close of the war . This will mean an annual debt service charge of around $2 billion at current interest rates . Since more than half the debt has been raised during the war on a short-term basis and will mature within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain a cheap money policy during funding operations or the burden of the debt will be increased . The Government has declared for cheap money during the transition but later it may relax control , Should this be done , there may be some conflict between maintaining the foreign exchange value of the pound and keeping down the burden of the debt . ? ? ? GOOD WILL TOURS of the coal mines are being made by the Minister of Fuel , Major Lloyd George , and the new chief of the Mine Owners Association , Robert Foot , who was formerly director of the British Broadcahing Corp . If the output of the mines is to be regularly increased , a better relation must be established between management and workers . Now that the miners are assured of an adequate minimum wage for some years ahead , the spectre of wage cuts and unemployment after the war should he scotched . A good omen is the luncheon invitation given to Mr. Foot by the miners . It is the first time on record that the owners ' chief has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EXAGGERATED IDEAS about the amount of British art works being exported to the United States were recently dissipated by Captain Waterhouse , parliamentary secretary of the Board of Trade . Many members of Parliament have spoken of the " tremendous outpourings " of the nation 's treasures , but Captain Waterhouse says that since the Imposition of the 1940 export licenses , they have averaged about 3,000 annually ; of those issued in 1942 about 1,000 were for pieces worth less than $20 and another thousand for those between $20 and $100 each . Moreover , the value of works of art and pictures exported annually to America declined to $56,000 in 1993 , against $1,360,000 in 1940 . ? ? ? THE FALL in Britain 's birthrate during the past 20 years is now beginning to have its effect in reducing the juvenile labor force available to industry , Today there are only 2,750,000 boys and girls between the ages of 14 and 18 , compared with 3,250,000 in 1937 . By 1956 these numbers will have fallen to 2,500,000 , about half of whom will he in school owing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years .
