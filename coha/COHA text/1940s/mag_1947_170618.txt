Only a block from the Hudson River pier where the Normandie burned and sank five years ago , fire broke out one day last week on the John Ericsson , formerly the Swedish liner Kungsholm . For three hours , fire engines and boats fought the flames while clouds of yellowish smoke billowed over the 85,000-ton Queen Elizabeth , tied up at the same pier and engaged in loading 2,200 passengers for her scheduled sailing that afternoon . The 20,200-ton John Ericsson , a troopship during the war , is owned by the Maritime Commission and operated by the United States Lines . With damage estimated at more than $500,000 , Maritime officials doubted that she would ever sail again under the U.S. flag .
