Spry , dry Henry Ford is again shaking up his fabulous empire . After 16 years of trying newfangled ideas , the sum of the evidence is that the Ford Motor Co. is going back to first principles . <P> Quietly eased out of the company were three top Ford men who have long espoused the newfangled ideas which old-fashioned Henry Ford has never completely accepted . The three : stocky , balding Laurence Spence Sheldrick , who came to Ford 20 years ago and has long worked as chief engineer ; lean , sandy-haired Eugene Turrenne Gregorie , boss of the body-design division ; quiet , patient Cornelius Willett Van Ranst , who helped develop the Ford airplane motor which now powers Ford-made tanks . <P> Project One . Henry Ford , man of one main idea , has always believed that automobiles are merely means of transportation . They should be mass-produced cheaply , without eye-catching gewgaws , and sold cheaply . He has little regard for the public 's fickle taste and fashions . Once he said : " Give them any color they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to these ideas , he continued to turn out his Model T until it was hopelessly obsolete . Up- &-coming; Chevrolet-and the modernizing influence of his late son Edsel-forced him to junk Model T in 1927 . By then he had lost a big chunk of the cheap-car market . He has never regained it . From then on Edsel 's influence caused the Ford Co. to cater to the public . Edsel established the styling division-Fords had been designed by Detroit 's Briggs Manufacturing Co. up till then-made Fords slicker , more eye-pleasing . He launched the Zephyr and the luxurious Lincoln-Continental . With his death ( TIME , June 7 ) all this was bound to change . The dropping of the three Ford men showed how far the change has gone . They were the last of the tight little group Edsel had formed to carry out his newfangled ideas . <P> Henry Ford kept his shrewd mouth shut clam-tight about the changes . But many a motor-wise man made good guesses . Most likely : when auto production is resumed , Ford will drop its Zephyr and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outsiders again ; will concentrate on turning out frill-free cars cheaper and faster than anyone else . In effect , the Lizzie would again become a kind of family jeep . <P> Henry Ford 's reasoning-if this is it-is obvious : car buyers may be more interested in getting places than in getting chromium cigaret lighters.
