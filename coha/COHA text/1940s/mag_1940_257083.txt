In 1936 a civilian wrote : <P> " The big new factor in the next war will be the motor . . . . Now , just as an airplane covers in an hour a distance which could be covered 25 years ago only by 20 days of marching , just so a mechanized army passing the frontier . . . can penetrate 40 leagues in the enemy country if it overcomes the obstacles it finds on the way . . . . <P> " What limits the power of a fleet is not the number of men , it is the number of ships . What limits the power of an air force is the number of planes . What will limit in the future the power of a land army will not be the number of men , it will be the number and power of its war engines . . . . <P> " It seems likely that the German Army , preceded by its powerful tanks , will roll in through Holland to Belgium where it is ardently to be hoped that the Albert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . If not , it would move toward our northern frontier , 350 kilometers wide . " <P> Last fortnight this prophecy came colossally true , and its author , Paul Reynaud occupied the unenviable post of Premier of France and Minister of Defense . <P> Land Fleets . When German mechanized columns plunged through Poland last September , the French Army , thanks partly to Paul Reynaud , had five mechanized divisions behind her Maginot Line , as well as many battalions of 11 to 15 ton tanks assigned to work with infantry divisions . During the long , dull winter the French sped up their tank production . <P> Lord Nuffield tried to do the same in England . Great Britain 's Royal Tank Corps became the Royal Armoured Corps of two divisions , plus two Territorial divisions , totaling in all about 1,000 tanks , mostly light ( 6 ton ) , with some Packard-motored 12 tonners . The Allies considered their tanks superior to Germany 's in armor and firepower , though slightly slower , less numerous . <P> Germany was known to have twelve divisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 20 tons , integrated into an Army of Attack organized by Lieut . General Heinz Guderian , 54 , a general-staff officer in World War I , since 1938 Commanding General of Armored Forces , now Chief of Motorized Troops . For his juggernauts ' work in Poland he received the Knight 's Iron Cross and the panache , <P> " Liberator of His Fatherland " ( because he was of three Polish divisions and a cavalry brigade east of that river , but the Allies estimated him chiefly from his textbook Look Out , Tanks ! ( 1939 ) , which summarized his basic tactical principle with superb triteness : " It is important to penetrate swiftly and deeply into enemy positions with a great number of tanks . " <P> So stood the tank situation last fortnight when one spearhead of the German Army of Attack darted across The Netherlands to Rotterdam . Three more lanced through above and below Liege , two more above and below Sedan . When General Guderian unleashed his Army , all Allied preconceptions of these columns ' speed and power went overboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans ' land machines so overwhelmed the Allies that only courage and discipline saved " strategic retreat " from immediately becoming " rout .
