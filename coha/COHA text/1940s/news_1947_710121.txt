txt WASHINGTON , Jan. ** meager attention given to that part of the Patterson-Forrestal agreement to coordinate the armed services which provides for a Council of National Defense is probably to be explained by twos circumstances . One is that the concept of the Council is so important and well worked out that no , objection can be found to it , even as to detail . The other is that about the only comment would be an expression of surprise that the Council did not exist in this form from 1939 forward . President Wilson established a Council of National Defense , and it operated very effectively in World War I. The report in 1940 of the committee headed by Edward R. Stettinius Jr . included a recommendation that the group be recreated , but the report was suppressed and this and other proposals were rejected . The concept came automatically to life again , however , when President Truman directed the studies of Army-Navy unification that produced , among otaer useful ideas , the plan prepared for Secretary Forrestal by Ferdinand Eberstadt and finally the basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement nothing is more important than the chart for a Council of National Defense . The President on June 15 , 1946 , gave its outlines to the chairmen of the House and Senate Military and Naval I Affairs Committees as follows : To integrate our foreign and military policies and to enable the military services and other agencies of government to cooperate more effectively in matters involving our national security . The membership of this Council should consist of the Secretary of State , the civilian head of the military establishment the proposed Secretary of National Defense , the civilian heads of the military services the proposed " Secretaries " for Army , Navy and Air , and the chairman of the National Security Resources Board . Mr. Truman then described the duties of this latter board as these : To establish , and keep up to date , policies and programs for the maximum use of the nation 's resources in support of our national security . It should operate under the Council and be composed of representatives of the military services and of other appropriate agencies . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forrestal on Oct. 22 , 1945 , proposed this very establishment under the name of " The National Security Council . " As he saw it at , the time , the President should be chairman , and , in his absence , the Vice President ( when there was one ) or the Secretary of State should act in that capacity . In the present agreement the Secretary of State is to be the permanent head of the group . But Mr. Eberstadt 's suggestion that it should be composed of that official , plus the civilian chiefs of the Army , the Navy and the Air Forces and the chairman of the National Resources Board , has survived . Moreover , the 1President 's statement last June preserves the gist of Mr. Eberstadt 's vision of a Council that would : Afford a permanent vehicle for ? maintaining active , close and continuous contact between the departments and agencies of our government responsible , respectively , for our foreign and military policies and their implementation * * * be the keystone of our organizational structure for national security 4. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coordinating all policies in the political and military fields , ( 2 ) of assessing and appraising our foreign objectives , commitments and risks , and ( 3 ) of keeping these in balance with our military power , in being and in potential . Mr. Eberstadt recommended that the Council should be a " policy-forming and advisory , and not an executive , body " ; that it should have a full-time secretariat , headed by a full-time executive ; and that the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a Central Intelligence Agency should be parts of it . He further proposed that the policies and activities of agencies dealing with scientific research and development , and with the conduct of psychological and economic warfare , should be under the Council 's control , and that the Council should review and advise the President on the combined military budget . Thus , he pointed out , it would be the permanent nucleus of a true War Cabinet in event of hostilities . Expansion of SWNC The probability is that , whatever Congress may do about the details of an Army-Navy- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerge and that most of Mr. Eberstadt 's ideas will be embodied in its charter . At present its closest counterpart is the State , War and Navy Departments ' CoLordinating Committee , known as SWNC and pronounced " Swink . " Its working members are Maj. Gen. John H. Hilldring , Assistant Secretary of State , Howard C. Petersen , Assistant Secretary of War , and John L. Sullivan , Under-Secretary of the Navy . When they can not agree decision is referred to their chiefs and , if thereafter necessary , to the President . Under the Council men like these would do the spade-work and the daily chores , as at present . But meetings of the plenary members would be held regularly . In these meetings the proposed " Secretaries " for the Army , the Navy and the Air Forces would participate on equal terms with the others . In the view of many . who have studied the problem this participation in the Council by these so-called Secretaries makes it a matter of no importance that they are not to be members of the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
