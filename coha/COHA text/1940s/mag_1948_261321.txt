The most important military refugee from Czechoslovakia since the Communist coup turned up in Heidelberg last week . He was slight , soft-spoken General Antonin Hasal , 55 , military adviser to President Eduard Benes until Communist Leader Klement Gottwald took over the presidency in June . Hasal , who at 25 was a general in the Czech Legion in Russia in World War I and fought with other Czech refugees in France in 1940 , began his third exile with an interview . Excerpts : <P> " Czech officials insist there will not be a war . So do the Soviets , and I think they will be very careful to avoid the responsibility for war . . . There does , however , seem to be some Czech urgency in preparing for a possible conflict . . . Czech heavy industry is now working mostly for the Russians , producing not finished articles but certain parts that will fit into armament . " <P> " The whole uranium-mining area of Jchymov is now more or less in the hands of the Russians . They have struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mines ; their numbers are estimated at 70,000 . " <P> " In the Czech army 70% of the 140,000 enlisted men can be counted as antiCommunist . Among officers the percentage is smaller because those with known democratic leanings have been purged . Some 1,200 officers have already been released or purged , including 25 of the 120 generals . About 14 generals have already escaped . Many , many more would like to escape . . . The western frontier is now more heavily guarded than at any time since the war . There are 45,000 police troops guarding the border and patrolling the Bohemian forests . " <P> " Members of the Czech air force have left the country by the hundreds , some of them flying their own planes . Because the government is worried that others may do so , it is removing many from the air force , which as a consequence is undergoing a marked disintegration . " <P> " Benes is not well ; he needs peace and quiet . He is not likely to make any kind of statement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . "
