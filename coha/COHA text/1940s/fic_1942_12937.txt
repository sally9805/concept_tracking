He ought to had sense enough to see , the more they kill up one another , the better it 'll be for us all -- If he had to bring you sorrow , the least he could-a done was make em draft him , stead of tryin to be a hero . NETTIE Hallie , you must be poscessed ! HALLIE I 'm speaking the bitter truth and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is pain and grief . They lead us a dog 's life from sun-up to Sun-down and even at night . They Jimorow us , and rob us , lynch us and kick our hind parts from the cradle to the grave . Then , when they get in a tough spot ; here they come shoutin about Freedom . Expect us to run out and die in their Jimorow Army -- For what ? So they can go on livin like kings while we have to suffer the life of Lazrus -- -If Paul had-a been mine ( and I been aimin to tell you this a long time ) , I 'd a killed him myself before I let him go off and die the death of a fool ! p. 17 NETTIE You 're the fool , Hallie . Not Paul . He did n't go to sea just out of love for this country -- Ai n't no Negro could hardlydo that . He went because he saw the world 's on fire , and he know if somebody do n't put it out we 're all going to get burned.  - -  - A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a bucket . You do n't stand by and watch because you know the owner do n't mean you no good . HALLIE You just tryin to make out a case for him cause you 're hurt . NETTIE I 'm hurt al right , and I do n't deny it . But if you want to know the truth .

They just said he was missing , and you know how big the ocean is . He may have already been rescued . Like Hallie said ; it takes time to check up , and every day you hear about some sailors being saved . WILL ( WITH A NOTE OF PROFOUND DESPAIR ) That boy 's on the bottom of the Atlantic , Nettie --  ( BREAKING WITH GRIEF AND A SENSE OF ABSOLUTE CERTITUDE ) and we 'll never see him no more ! SOUND RUSHING FOOTSTEPS ACROSS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will ! SOUND BANGING OF DOOR MUSIC UP IN FLOOD THEN FADING ANNOUNCER For two hours Nettie Sampson waited for Will 's return . Then , she sent the two oldest girls , Georgia and Clara , to look for him , and now she and Hallie ( who has dropped in for her money ) are in thekitchen , where the youngsters are making their report . SOUND CHILD CRYING NETTIE May , will you hush ! and let me get the straight of this . MAY But , Mother , I 'm hungry ! HALLIE Course you are -- Come here and sit in Miss Hallie 's lap . NETTIE Georgia , did he say what tavern ? GEORGIA Yes . The one on the corner of a Hundred and Thirty-Second and Avenue . NETTIE May , I asked you to hush !  - -  He must be having trouble trying to cash the cheek -- - HALLIE Long as you been living round here ? NETTIE He never had any trouble before -- I ca n't understand it . p. 21 CLARA Mr. said Daddy was drunk ! HALLIE That settles it ! NETTIE Your father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. said . GEORGIA We looked in the tavern but he was n't there -- Did n't we , Clara ?

NETTIE Find him -- There 's no telling what he 'll get into -- Georgia , you and Clara come downstaira with me -- I 'll see if Mrs Cohen will let me have some milk and cookies , so you all can go to bed -- -And , Hallie , do n't fool with May . Make her mind you . SOUND MUSIC UP AND DOWN ANNOUNCER Thus it was that for Three hours Nettie Sampson tramped the streets of Hurlem , searching for the heart-broken Will without success . It was nearly Two O'clock the following morning before he showed up , his head bleeding and his pockets empty after encountering a bunch of young thugs who had robbed him . He is sttempting now to explain while Nettie applies a bandage to his wound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been for the blackout ; they never would 've hemmed me up in that vestibule , where the Air-raid Warden forced me to get . NETTIE Try and tell that to your children when they get up hungry in the morning . WILL Can I help it if I was robbed ? NETTIE Hold your head still -- with a gash like this , you ' should 've gone to the hospital and let them put some stitches in it --  Why did n't you call the police ? WILL I hollered for them , but they ai n't never around when you need them . NETTIE You know conditions in Harlem before you went out of here --  drinking yourself drunk and trying to get yourself killed --  what good did it do you ? WILL I just felt so bad , Nettie -- But them little rats -- All they do is hang around waiting to mug somebody . NETTIE You know there 's no work for them . You know it was only by the Grace of God your own son did n't end up mugging somebody ! Furthermore , the least you could 've done was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's gone now -- Every dime of it . p. 23 NETTIE Yes . But maybe you can tell me , how I 'm going to meet old man Johnson when he comes for the rent in the morning ? Maybe you can figure out a way to convince Mrs. Cohen to let me have food for another month to feed the children ? WILL Go on , Nettie , rub it in . Another pineh of salt or two wo n't make the sting no worse . NETTIE That 's right -- Whine ! WILL I know you think I'mweak . You always did . For all my struggling , you think I 've lead you a dog 's life and been less than a father to the children -- and yet , I 've always done the best I could . NETTIE Like going out of here and throwing your last dime away when you know there 's no place in God 's world you can get another -- You may call that your best , but I call it stupid ! WILL Stupid , oh ? Whose fault is it , out of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose get so much as a Five dollar bill they can loan me or anybody else tonight ? All my friends , just like me -- So poor a moth wo n't even look at their house , less more'n glance at the clothes closet . But I ai n't supposed to care nothing about that . There 's plenty War work . But I 'm supposed to thank God for the WPA . From now on , I reckon , I 'm supposed to go around with my chest stuck out , because I 've proved I 'm an American too , and got the right to put a gold star in the window -- if ever I get far enough ahead to walk into the Five and Ten Cents Store to buy one ! I still say it was stupid ; p. 24 NETTIE You 've had a hard life , Will . But there 's no sense in looking back . WILL What you want me to do , deny my life ? NETTIE Bitterness ai n't going to get you no place and furthermore --  WILL With Paul gone , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the grit of a sparrow ! . WILL You do n't know what he meant to me , Nettie ; you do n't know the hope I had in him . NETTIE You 've got five others asleep in there -- Have you forgotten that ? Whether you love them or not , they 've got to live . WILL Yeah- - for what ?  --  To grow up and run somebody 's kitchen or walk the streets ! NETTIE If I thought that , nobody in this house would live to see the light of day . But I know better . If there 's any sense at all in Paul 's death and this whole cruel war , it 's got to be there 's going to be some changes made in this world . WILL Sure . Let you tell it , we 're right on the brink of freedom ! NETTIE Yes , freedom . But I'mnot going into that again . If you 're so blind you ca n't see it 's just before day in the morning for us , it 's no fault of mine nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

And that 's a sure sign when the war 's over , the people of the world is going to be free --  ' ' free as the fish in the sea --  right where your encouraging him him to his death ! NETTIE Do n't stop . Go right on and scoff . Maybe when you get through , you 'll be in the spirit to put your mind on the predicament you 've put us in ? Maybe you 'll stop looking back and turn forward long enough for once to tell me how you 're going to keep the landlord from setting us out in the street , or the children from starving to death ! SOUND MUSIC UP ANDFADING ANNOUNCER The following morning Will returned to work , leaving Nettie to face the Superintendant , who has come for the rent .

NETTIE But I tell you I 'll pay ; you know I 'll pay ! JOHNSON But you do n't say when .

But the Colored use more hot water ; twido as much and sometimes maybe more . Rent day come , I ca n't never collect , and in the winter they do n't never stop hollorin bout the heat . We tryin to get the coal in now like the Government asked everybody and prices are way up . Mr. Holland say all these old houses ai n't nothin but a chain round his neck . You all think he 's rich .

WARWICK Between your husband 's wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an income of $133.00 per month , while your budget only calls for $36.00 -- How do you account for it that you have n't been able to save anything for just such an emergency as this ? NETTIE I have n't had anything to save . WARWICK You were able to get along on $55.00 before your son went to work -- What 'd you do with the $78.00 he earned ? NETTIE I never got no $78.00 regular from him . He had his own expenses , and furthermore , it 's been three months since he had the chance to give me a dime. p. 28 WARWICK How 's that ? NETTIE I told you , Miss Warwick , it took three months for him to make a trip . WARWICK How much did he give you the last time ? NETTIE A $100.00 -- but that was in February . WARWICK What did you do with that ? NETTIE I spent it for needed things . WARWICK Like what ? Just what did you buy ? NETTIE Well , I too the children 's feet off the ground . My husband had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $25.00 on him -- And I used $11.00 for groceries -- - WARWICK What wereyou doing with a grocery bill ? NETTIE Miss Warwick , you know $55.00 ai n't enough to take care of a family of Seven -- even with the few cabbages and prunes you allow for the suppliment . WARWICK You sayyou spent an $100.00 on your husband and children ? NETTIE I did n't say that . There were other things . I got some sheets , and tubes for the radio and I bought myself a pair of shoes . WARWICK But in the meantime yourhusband was receiving his check . p. 29 NETTIE Yes . And I was getting along all right until somebody stole it last month . That 's what put me in the hole . WARWICK You ' should 've been able to save something if you were n't so extravagant , do n't you think ? NETTIE ( ANGRIE ) Look at this dress . Would you wear it to go fishing ? Look at my shoes !

There are express provisions against rendering aid in cases like yours where the husband has shown himself to be a drunkard . NETTIE A drunkard -- You know that is n't true !

But the following morning found her in Court , tense and bewildered and alone . Convinced that her last resort had failed her , She arose from her seat as SOUND MURMUR OF VOICES CLERK ( CALLING ) Holland Vs Sampson -- -Are you ready for trial ? COLE The Plaintiff is ready . CLERK Are you the plaintiff ? COLE I 'm Attorney Warren Cole , representing him . CLERK Will the Defendant , William Sampson , step up to the bar . NETTIE He had to go to work -- But I 'm his wife . p. 38 CLERK Stop inside the rail -- Your Honor , this is a request for eviction for non-payment of rent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearing , Your Honor . JUDGE Well , what 've you to say for yourself -- Why have n't you paid your rent ? NETTIE I did n't have the money , Your Honor . But for three years I 've always paid my rent promptly . And if the landlord had given me a little time I would n't have to face the disgrace of being dragged here before you . As it is , I 'm sure I 'll be able to pay . I went down to my son 's Union last night , and they promised to help me . I do n't owe but two weeks back rent , and for this month in advance . And I would n't owe that , if I had n't run into unexpected trouble . JUDGE What sort of unexpected trouble ? COLE Your Honor , she probably means her husband 's recent drunken spree ! NETTIE That is n't so , Judge -- - COLE Doyou deny your husband was drunk ? NETTIE Not in the way you mean -- In the first place , Your Honor , my husband ai n't no drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reason and a goodone for getting drunk . And furthermore , he was held up and robbed during the blackout -- - p. 39 COLE This business of therobbery , Your Honor , is a flimsy attempt to influence the judgment of the Court . Last month the family defaulted in half the amount of the rent , claiming then that the husband 's check had been stolen from the mails . Evidently , they felt that was too thin to try again , so they 've invented a robbery . The police have no record of any such crime . On the other hand , we have evidence that will Sampson received his latest check , in the amount of $65. as our resident agent can testify . What happened is that Will Sampson , as usual with his irresponsible type , simply joined his cronies at the bar and spent the money having a good time . In view of these facts , my client has determined to reposses . As consel for the Plaintiff . I therefore respectfully ask that Your Honor enter an order to that effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's twisted things . My husband got drunk because of his grief . When he came home I showed him this telegram and he was sohurt by it he tried to drink , when he was n't used to it . JUDGE Let me see the telegram . p. 40 NETTIE Yes , Sir.  - -  - That 's howcome he was n't able to protect himself from the young boys who robbed him . He ai n't no drinking man , an everybody in our neighborhood knows it . JUDGE Has Counsel for the Plaintiff considered the extenuating circumstance of the son 's probable death in the service ? COLE I am glad to note that Your Honor said probable , for my client has considered the point . While he regrets , just as any good American would , that the boy is missing ; and would , under other circumstances , consider it his patriotic duty to be lenient ; experience indicates that once a subsistence level tenant , as this family , gets in arrears , it is highly improbable that they can ever catch up ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go deeper in . It was , however , in complete disregard of being further penalized that he decided to request the eviction . On the contrary , he felt it the kindess thing he could do , since in that event the family would be able to get a new start without being handicapped by thedrain on its resources in trying to catch up with the back rent . JUDGE The Court appreciates your candor , but can not refrain from expressing his regret that in entering this order he is constrained by the mandatory limit fixed by law . With reference to the Defendant , I must order you to vacate the premises . But I am giving you the benefit of the full ten days , which is the limit of the law , and I trust that by the end of that time you will have received the assistance you so obviously deserve . p. 41 NETTIE But ten days , Your Honor ! JUDGE I regret it is beyond my power to extend it any further . NETTIE But , Your Honor . What am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I ai n't got no place in the world to go , and I 've got five little children -- You ca n't set me out like this . JUDGE I wish I could avoid it . But it 's the law . NETTIE The ship people say they ca n't let me have my son 's wages cause that 's the law . The Relief say the same thing . And here you are , Your Honor , going to set me cut in the street cause that 's the law , and you say you ca n't get round it . I do n't deny your word and theirs neither . But I want you to know one thing , Your Honor . I ai n't lived in this country all my life without seeing some laws overlooked --  the 14th and 15th Amendments for example . They 're supposed to be laws too , but I got my first time to hear where a Judge thought it was his duty to abide by them .
