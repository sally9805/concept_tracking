" My other piece of advice , Copper field , you know . Annual income twenty pounds , annual expenditure nineteen nineteen six , result happiness . Annual income twenty pounds , annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six , result misery . The blossom is blighted , the leaf is withered , the God of day goes down upon the dreary scene and - in short , you are flat . " <P> If the words of that incurable optimist , Mr. Wilkins Micawber , rang in the ears of Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau last week , Mr. Morgenthau gave no sign . He had just floated the biggest peacetime loan in U.S. history-$1,504,425,000* to keep the Government going until Dec. 1 . This loan brought the U.S. national debt to a record high of $52,710,632,552.76 . <P> In Wilkins Micawber language , the U.S. Government 's position is now about this : Monthly income : 700 million dollars ; monthly expenditures : 700 million dollars and one billion more ; results : any man 's guess . <P> The new debt limit , set by Congress earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few months Mr. Morgenthau will have to borrow several more billions . Before another year is out , Mr. Morgenthau will probably have to ask Congress to up the limit again . <P> <P> * Only $1,200,000,000 of Mr. Morgenthau 's bond issue was for sale to the public . Bearing 2% interest , maturing in 25 to 31 years , it was designed to appeal to individuals rather than to banks , and thus to discourage an inflationary increase in bank credit . The issue was snapped up by hungry investors in a few hours . Another $204,425,400 will be exchanged for old bonds , bearing 1% , which mature in December . The remaining $100,000,000 will be reinvested in Government trust accounts .
