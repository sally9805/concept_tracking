The Tory gentlemen of the House of Lords were angry . Peer after peer rose to condemn Britain 's decision to quit India next year ( TIME , March 3 ) . The Conservative leader , Viscount Cranborne , said the Government was " throwing up the sponge . . . abandoning our friends , washing their hands of the whole business . " A motion of condemnation came from an old India hand , Viscount Templewood ( as Sir Samuel Hoare he had been Secretary of State for India four years , then Foreign Secretary in 1935 ) . He and others argued that the Government 's decision was a betrayal of India 's minorities and " a gambler 's throw , " with civil war at stake . <P> Laborites pleaded strongly against taking a vote on the motion . The Tories and Liberals were in a mean mood and , with a predominant majority , were certain to pass it . An adverse vote would not alter the Government 's policy ( only a defeat by the House of Commons could do that ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain itself was disunited on India policy . <P> No Better ' Ole . In this tense situation up rose another old India hand : the Earl of Halifax , Viceroy of India from 1926 to 1931 , Britain 's great wartime Ambassador to the U.S. He sadly admitted that Britain 's position in India was " rapidly becoming intolerable , " and he thought that the Government 's decision to pull out next year was " at least as likely to encourage disunity as to encourage unity . " But , said Halifax : " The truth is that for India today there is no solution that is not fraught with the gravest objection , the gravest danger . . . . With all that can be said against it ... I am not prepared to condemn what His Majesty 's Government are doing unless I can honestly and confidently recommend a better solution . " That he could not do . <P> Tory Halifax powerfully pleaded that an anti-Government vote would have serious repercussions in India : " I should be sorry if the only message from this House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what I must fully recognize are very natural feelings of failure , frustration and foreboding . " Halifax 's appeal carried the day . Laborites cheered him . The Loyal Opposition backed down from a vote . <P> No Better Yet . In India last week progress toward unity seemed to be in reverse . The Moslem League rejected overtures from the Hindu-dominated Congress Party to dicker over their differences . In the Punjab a Sikh army was being organized , just in case the Moslems tried to lay the cornerstone of a separate Pakistan in that province . In Sind , the League-dominated provincial government talked about arming a Moslem militia , just in case a Hindu army invaded Pakistan after the British withdrawal . <P> Politics , like nature , abhors a vacuum . <P> As the British withdrawal became more certain , the Indian factions rushed in with increased determination to inherit the Raj . If civil chaos ensued , who would bring order ? The U.N. ? The U.S. ? The U.S.S.R. ?              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
