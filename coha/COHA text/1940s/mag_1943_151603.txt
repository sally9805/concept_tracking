Nearly every Congressman , at least once in his life , is suddenly struck with a grand-scale idea about money as the root of all evil . Forthwith he takes pen in hand and writes either a book or a bill . <P> Latest Congressman thus smitten is California 's anxious , serious young Jerry Voorhis ( Dem . ) . Last month he published a book , Out of Debt , Out of Danger ( Devin-Adair ; $3 ) . <P> Jerry Voorhis pours into its 238 pages the same Messianic energy with which he once served on Yale debating teams , and now server in Congress . He indicts " sound money " financiers all the way from Alexander Hamilton to J. P. Morgan , and incidentally does some hard thinking on one of the biggest and most difficult subjects of all . <P> The Thesis . Jerry Voorhis starts with the incontrovertible fact that the national debt is rising at an appalling rate . He guesses it may reach $300 billions before war and reconstruction are done . <P> Some of the Government 's borrowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voorhis considers all to the good . But easily 50% of the borrowing is done by selling Government bonds to the banking system , which in turn creates deposit money to the Government 's favor . <P> This , according to Jerry Voorhis , is all wrong , not because it is highly inflationary-the conventional reason-but because the issue of new money should not be a private banking function at all . Nor should the issue of new money involve the creation of debt . If the Government has to have more money over &; above what it raises in taxes , it should be able to create it free of charge . This might be done , Reformer Voorhis suggests , by the Government 's taking over the Federal Reserve System , creating out of it a super-monetary authority , and giving this authority exclusive powers of note issue . <P> Credits &; Debits . Mr. Voorhis ' thesis is not new . He has drawn heavily on Professor Irving Fisher 's book , 100% Money . His argument that the Government should , in practice as well as theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectable backing . <P> Mr. Voorhis assumes that the country 's economic ills could be cured just by changing the technique of money issue . The real cause of the inflation , as Voorhis himself suggests , is the failure of Congress to tax sufficiently hard . But , to the question whether Congress would be more or less disposed to tax if Government could just print up money indefinitely without going into debt , Voorhis says bluntly " More . " <P> &gt; Believing in the quantity-of-money theory , Voorhis argues further that the supply of money controls employment. * <P> Best part of Jerry Voorhis ' book is his reiteration that no nation can go broke if it keeps its men and machines at work . Most dubious is his emphasis that money is the prime mover in accomplishing this desirable end . Worst slip is his martyrish hint that President Lincoln was shot because ( according to Mr. Voorhis ) Lincoln had ideas about money like those of Mr. Voorhis . <P> <P> *In 1926 , when the U.S. had tolerably full employment , there was $4,885,300,000 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency and deposits were substantially higher yet the country had over 7,500,000 men out of work .
