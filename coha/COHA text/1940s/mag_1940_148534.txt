ARETINO , SCOURGE OF PRINCES - Thomas Caldecot Chubb - Reynal &; Hitchcock ( $3.50 ) . <P> Two centuries ago , Pietro Aretino 's fame was still such that Joseph Addison could doubt whether a single man alive did not know who he was . Today , except to literary specialists , his name is the mildest of pornographic hearsay . Thomas Caldecot Chubb 's somewhat frumpish but thoroughgoing biography should do a lot toward resurrecting him . <P> Starting as a hill town cobbler 's son , Aretino became the most powerful and popular writer in Europe , was perhaps the greatest and certainly the dirtiest master of low vernacular prior to Louis-Ferdinand Celine . Through blackmail , stark flattery , incredible effrontery , and a genius for spotlighting weakness wittily , he forced most of the greatest men of his time to pay his way and to acknowledge him as equal . His great friend Titian described him as " a condottiere ( gangster boss ) of literature . " Biographer Chubb compares his fame to that of Byron , his influence to that of Voltaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took his name from his town , Arezzo , where he was born on Good Friday of the year Columbus sighted America . ( Good Friday , as his enemies loved to remind the world , was the legendary birthday of the Antichrist . ) Mature and restive at 15 , he quit home . He worked , during the next few years , as a servant in Rome , a street singer , a hostler in Bologna , a moneylender 's agent , tax collector , mule driver , hangman 's assistant , miller , courier , pimp , mountebank , swindler , galley slave . At 24 he got into the service of Agostino Chigi , one of Rome 's biggest business men . He had already published a book and was watching his chance . It came in the death of Hanno , fat Pope Leo X 's pet elephant . <P> Aretino wrote the beast 's Last Will &; Testament , assigning Hanno 's various organs to those cardinals they most scandalously fitted . Leo made him his court jester , and on the next fat chance-a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's death-Aretino made himself famous all over Europe . <P> After that Aretino began working the nobility . The crooked Marquis of Mantua , violent Giovanni della Bande Nere became patrons and friends . Then through miscalculating some smart moves he was nearly murdered , moved to Venice for safety . He spent the rest of his life there . Emperor Charles V and the Doge were among his patrons . He spent his cadgings bottomlessly on himself , on poor people , and on the women and artist bums who swarmed his house . He tirelessly promoted his friend Titian ; managed , by two extraordinary letters , to scare Francis I out of an alliance with Turkey ; quarreled with everyone from his own secretaries to Michelangelo . <P> In the midst of this stertorous and priapic life , in a house so crowded that travelers mistook it for an inn , Aretino cranked out an enormous mass of writing - plays , letters , parody horoscopes , obscene dialogues , an uninspired epic , religious tracts , florid and fulsome eulogies .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
