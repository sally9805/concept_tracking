The biggest A.E.F. of newsmen in World War II last week went into action in Australia . <P> Its components : 34 uniformed newsmen and photographers who arrived with a big convoy of U.S. troops , plus such veterans of the Battles of Java and Singapore as A.P . ' s C. Yates McDaniel , U.P . ' s Harold Guard , the Chicago Daily News 's much machine-gunned George Weller-a total of over two dozen correspondents , photographers , broadcasters , newsreelmen . <P> The first action of the newcomers was a battle with censorship . The uniformed , Army-regulated correspondents , who had waited weeks in Washington for credentials , were forbidden to send stories until USAFA headquarters , several hundred miles away , re-accredited them . First they were scooped on the news of the arrival of U.S. troops in Australia when the Chicago Sun 's Edward Angly , who arrived on an earlier convoy , went to a neighboring town and filed a dispatch which the censor let slip past . <P> Then , tipped off that big news was coming , the correspondents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell how he got there . So they were scooped again by the Chicago Sim 's H. R. Knickerbocker and the New York Herald Tribune 's Allen Raymond , who presumably had not heard that details of MacArthur 's trip were off the record . <P> General MacArthur , who has no mania for secrecy , soon dynamited the worst censorship log jams . Then the correspondents were left to fight the battle of transmission . Before the war the South Pacific had eight cables , several big radio stations . Only two cables remain , one of them a slow , alternate route around Africa . These puny facilities are jammed by Government priority messages ; correspondents sometimes have to wait in line for as many as 400 Government code messages . <P> The correspondents ' third battle was coverage . Australia is roughly the size of the U.S. , and action is scattered around much of its frontier . Moreover , although Canberra is technically the capital , the Cabinet just as often meets in Melbourne or Sydney , and communiqus are issued all over the lot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well schooled in **31;8954;TOOLONG , had got themselves settled in two " certain hotels " in the " same city , " were scouting around for the most likely action spots .
