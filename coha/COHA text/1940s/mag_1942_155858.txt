Without fuss or feathers , 27 farmers ' wives gathered in Chicago last week to draw up a " wartime platform for American farm women . " <P> The 27 farmers ' wives , picked by Farm Journal and Farmer 's Wife as representatives of the nation , were determined that , as far as they could manage it , the helter-skelter , out-of-kilter of World War I should not happen again . With stout good sense , they therefore agreed that : <P> &gt; " For most farm women the biggest challenge of patriotism will be to do what they are already doing-only to do it better . An extra dozen eggs may be more vital than knitting an extra sweater or an ill-fitting sock . <P> &gt; " It is the duty of every woman who can spare time from her home to volunteer with existing organizations . We need no new ones . <P> &gt; " We call on draft officials to draw physicians for the armed services largely from cities . . . and not from rural communities which are already seriously underserviced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . and to fortify themselves ... by taking current training on home nursing and first aid . <P> &gt; " We pledge a family garden on every farm . . . . Conserve the year 's food needs of the family . ... By preserving our own food we undertake to release the commercial pack for urban people , Red Cross needs and our allies overseas . <P> &gt; " Food production is as essential to winning the war as the production of munitions . . . . Draft boards should determine the contribution toward victory of each boy . Voluntary enlistment should stop . <P> &gt; " We recommend that school schedules be adjusted to free children for farm work during seasonal peaks-without sacrificing . . . standards . <P> &gt; " We urge WPA officials to terminate nonessential projects to release labor for farms .
