As Government troops closed on Yenan last week , leaders of opposing groups in the Kuomintang allowed themselves a brisk foreign policy debate , largely on the preoccupying question of relations with Russia . Here is the account of TIME Correspondent Frederick Gruin : <P> Good , greying Wang Shih-chieh , China 's Foreign Minister , generally regarded as one of the progressive-minded " Political Science Group , " had reported on the past year 's conduct of foreign affairs . But few members of the Kuomintang council who listened-and especially the right-wing " CC " clique-were satisfied with the way the Chinese Government had followed the U.S. Far Eastern policy of trying to pla cate Russia . They cleared their throats for some sounding off . Next day it came . Accentuate the Positive . Said mandarin-gowned Ku Cheng-ting : " We are suffering either from fear of Russia or from hate of Russia . Neither feeling is right , for each is negative . The U.S. and Britain have taken an open , positive attitude toward Russia . We , too , can adopt such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protest over looting in Manchuria ? Ku found fault , too , with Wang 's attitude toward the U.S.-China could use the $500 million credit , but not on cringing conditions : " We must have courage . ... If we feel a course is right , we must follow it even at the risk of failure . . . . " <P> A procession of Wang 's critics followed until , finally , long-gowned , gnomelike Shao Li-tse spoke up for fellow liberal Wang and next-door neighbor Russia : " We must remember China and Russia have a long , common border . We must have friendship with Russia . . . must remember Russia , . in spite of recent actions , helped our revolution in the past . . . actually gave us the first outside material aid ... against Japan . " <P> " In foreign policy , " Wang 's defender said , " we must be careful . This is no time for desperate heroics . . . . " <P> Original Critic Ku burst in : " Everyone knows about the long frontier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and respect . " There was applause . <P> Eliminate the Negative . Now it was time for Foreign Minister Wang to speak for himself . Outwardly composed but inwardly agitated , Wang defended his record . He reminded his colleagues : " To carry out an effective national policy we must have a united front of all China . If this is impossible , we must have a united front of the party . " Then , stung as only a face-conscious Chinese high official can be by the criticism of his official juniors , Wang said the debate convinced him that he was not " the man to carry on . " He would , indeed , be grateful for a rest and would offer his resignation as Foreign Minister . <P> This did not silence the critics , either . <P> " Wrong attitude ! " shouted one party-man . " When anyone criticizes a Minister he wants to resign . A Minister must accept criticism and strive to correct his faults . Wrong attitude ! "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
