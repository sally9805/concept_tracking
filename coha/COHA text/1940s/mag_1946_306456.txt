Most of the white spectators jamming the small federal courtroom in Jackson , Miss , had a real good time laughing and winking . Sometimes they shouted : " Tell ' em , Bilbo ! " " The Man " himself was in high humor-despite the fact that he faced possible loss of his Senate seat . <P> Even the Senate Campaign Expenditures Committee , which conducted the four-day hearing , had trouble keeping an inquisitorial face . Somehow , way down there in Mississippi , the investigation of ailing , aging Senator Theodore Gilmore Bilbo on charges of having coerced and intimidated Mississippi 's Negroes not to vote seemed kind of silly . <P> An early witness , a Negro veteran , said that white men had whipped him with a piece of cable after he had tried to register for Mississippi 's white primary and had then given him a ride back to town . ( This brought guffaws from the spectators . ) Then a shoe repairman and a taxi driver admitted that they had each received $25 for warning fellow Negroes away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polling officials why his parishioners were not allowed to vote , had received the answer : " No Negroes are going to vote in Pass Christian Miss. unless they paint their faces white . " <P> " The Best Way . .. . " Throughout the whole parade of 96 witnesses-most of them telling a tale of violence , jailing , bribery or " friendly advice " from white folks-only one piece of evidence connected the confident Bilbo with the fact that only 1,500 of Mississippi 's 500,000 eligible Negroes had voted in July . That was one phrase , from a Bilbo campaign address in June : " The best way to keep a nigger away from a white primary in Mississippi is to see him the night before . " <P> When the hearing was over , Bilbo , his five lawyers , the committee , and particularly Louisiana 's Democratic Senator Allen Ellender , committee chairman and Bilbo buddy , seemed well satisfied . The committee returned to Washington to write a report . Few expected that it would recommend unseating the Senator . <P> But The Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Investigating Committee said that it had well-documented evidence that Bilbo had accepted $100,000 in goods &; services from Mississippi war contractors-and it wanted to find out about it . Senator Robert Taft had announced that the new Senate would inquire into Bilbo 's qualifications . The Man might have a harder time laughing himself out of these probes . <P> - <P> In Chicago , Colonel Robert R. McCormick 's arch-Republican Tribune suggested a scheme to penalize states which will not let all their citizens vote : <P> " The second section of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution says , in effect , that any state which denies Negroes the right to vote shall have its representation in Congress reduced in proportion to the number suffering discrimination . Thus if the right of Mississippi Negroes to vote was infringed , Mississippi 's representation in the House should be cut from seven to perhaps four or five . . . . "
