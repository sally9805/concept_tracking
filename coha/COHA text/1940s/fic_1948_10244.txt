made the wharves in a few minutes , and woke a fat Frenchman who slumbered beneath the single mast of a roundbelliedboat hollowed out of a cypress log . A moment 's conversationand the musical clink of gold pieces were enough to rouse him into astonishing activity . He kicked the Negro slave who slept under the long arm of the tiller , and started clumsily to unfurl the single sail . Kit aided him , and five minutes later the fat-hulled hoy was butting its way out of the harbor of BasseTerretoward the southern part of Haiti , and Aux Cayes . Kit stood in the bow , gazing at the shore line of Aux Cayes that grew more distinct with a slowness that was pure torture . Before the hoy had pushed its prow into the sand , he was over the side , wading through the surf . Bernardo followed him from a distance , seeing him racing up the beach toward a group of French freebooters who lay in languid conversation under the shadow of the palms . They looked up at Kit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumble of his words became clear . Then broad grins split their leather countenances . " The little red one ? " one of them said . " But certainly ! She came ashore over there  --  on the Isle des Vaches . We 've heard she stabbed five men before she was subdued . " " Subdued ? Pahl " one of his companions spat . " That red-haired sea witch was never subdued ! She came wading through the surf naked as a newborn , with a knife in her teeth , and . . . " " Damn your eyes to deep-blue hell ! " a third put in . " These creatures of a most incredible imbecility have not yet the right of it , Monsieur le Capitaine ! The little Rouge came ashore , and those stupid beasts on Cow Island ... " Kit looked from one to another of them . " Do any of you really know what happened ? " he demanded . " Were you there ? " " That , no , " the filibusters said reluctantly , " but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damn their intelligence , " Bernardo growled . He had come up during the Gallic uproar and had heard most of the dispute . " Let 's cross over to Cow Island and get the truth . " " Aye , " Kit growled . They retraced their steps to the hoy and40silenced the protest of the weary captain with another louis d'or . An hour later they hove to in a sheltered cove off Cow Island . Then they inched their way quietly ashore between the throngs of French vessels that always tied up there . Kit 's queries made him at once the center of a voluble crowd . Of the many who attempted to tell the tale , there were three who spoke with authority . " But yes , " an old Gascon said , " we were there . This child with the red hair swam ashore on the seaward side where a corvette lay at anchor . She had n't a stitch on her back and her skin was like the milk of eyes , like pearl , like ... " " That I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She was exhausted , the poor little one . But for the blind stupidity of those insane ones , she would have had no time to rest . Instead of lining up and taking their turn like men of discretion , they began to fight over her . Seven men were killed in the fight . I do believe that this little Rouge enjoyed it . When at last most of them were wounded , she got hold of two pistols that had fallen to the sand and pointed them at the men . She forced a little Parisian to remove his doublet and trousers and dressed herself in them . This done , she made them bring her water and food . " " They did not rush her ? " Bernardo demanded . " All of them together could have ... " " They were too bemused by her beauty  --  and her courage . No , the knaves swore on the nonexistent honor of the strolling street wenches who bore them that they would not molest her further , and asked her to choose a husband from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kit growled . " No . She laughed at them . The next night , since the captain of the corvette had fallen in the battle over her , the crew of that vessel set about electing a new leader . In the midst of the dispute , the little Rouge strode among them and declared that since she had more wit and courage than any twenty of them , she would be their captain , and that the election was at an end . " " Mother of God ! " Kit breathed . " All seamen , " Bernardo declared , " fear the presence of a woman aboard ship worse than the plague . " 41 " But yes , " the old Gascon agreed . " Still , they looked at the milky curves of her legs under those tattered trousers , and heryoung breasts pushing their way half out of her shirt , and decidedperhaps that once at sea . . . " " Where is she now ? " Kit demanded . The old Gascon swept his arm out over the great blue curve of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And I will wager my life , what there is left of it , Monsieur le Capitaine , that wherever she is , she commands that vessel still . " " Why do you believe that ? " Kit said quietly . " Because in her there is a hatred that is absolutely bottomless , a cruelty that burns bright as the flame of her hair . She hasdeclared war on the whole race of men . That war she cannotwin . But many a brave matelot will die in his blood before they swing her from a yardarm . " " That , " Kit said slowly , " they will never do . Not while I have life . Come , Bernardo . " " What now ? " Bernardo said as they tramped through the sand toward the waiting hoy . " Back to Basse-Terre . Back to the Sea flower . Then , Bernardo , we will comb the sea of the Caribbees . Till I find her again , this little Rouge , there will be no rest for me , nor any joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muttered under his breath . " Would God they had cut her throat ! " Kit glanced at him over his shoulder . " What did you say , Bernardo ? " he asked quietly . " Nothing , " Bernardo growled . " I need my feeble breath . Let us be off . " But Kit was already gone , running hard toward the place where the hoy danced in the freshening surf. 423DURING ALL THE TIME that Lazarus had commanded her , the Sea flower had been forced to sail shorthanded , but now at last Kit found it possible to take his pick of seamen to man her . Of these , the greater part were Frenchmen from the provinces of Brittany , Normandy , and Gascony ; but the remainder includedWelsh , Irish , Scots , and Englishmen who had fled to the French Antilles to escape punishment for crimes committed in their homelands . There were boys , too , who shipped as powder monkeys and cabin boys , and one or two runaway Negro slaves . Kit had appointed Bernardo his master 's mate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dupre read the sailing articles , the former in English , and the latter in French . " Each man to bring his own powder and shot , " Smithers bellowed , and Dupre repeated the announcement in French . No prey , no pay ! " The circle of men nodded grimly . They were quite accustomed to such arrangements . " Our good captain , Christopher Gerado , receives one thousandecus in pay . Our master 's mate , seven hundred . Our second mate  --  myself , lads  --  five hundred . The carpenter and shipwright , three hundred . The surgeon , two hundred and fifty , including medicines . All others one hundred , except the boys , who get fifty . Recompense to the wounded is as follows : Six hundred ecus or six slaves for the loss of a limb ; three hundred ecus or three slaves for loss of a thumb , an index finger of the right hand , or an eye . " " But matey , " a Welshman protested , " I be left-handed ! " " Them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others 43do for the right , " Smithers ruled at once . " One hundred ecus for the loss of any other finger . Each man to select a partner or matelot to fight at his side , to nurse him when hurt or sick , and to inherit all his goods if he be killed and has no woman . " Smithers paused for breath . " Now for divvying up the loot , " he continued . " After the pay and the recompense to the wounded is taken out , we share in this fashion : Six portions to the cap'n . Two to the master 's mate . One and three-quarters to the second mate ; one and one-half to the shipwright ; one and one-quarter to the surgeon . All others one share , except the boys , who get one half-share . Fair enough ? " " Fair enough , " the throng of grimy men agreed . " Then aboard with you ! " Smithers bellowed . " Look alive and pull right hearty ! " Kit watched them as they came aboard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Smithers , " he said quietly . The courtesy was deliberate . Lazarus had taken care to instill into Kit all the niceties of seamanship , even to the courtesiesusual among officers of Their Majesties ' Royal Navy . That this formal turn of speech was somewhat out of place aboard a freebooter apparently never had entered the old leper captain 's head . As for Kit , he followed what he had been taught without question . The winch clanked and the thick coils of tarred hemp tightened . Slowly the ring of heavy , hand-hammered wrought iron broke water . At Kit 's side , Bernardo Diaz cleared his throat . ' What is it , Bernardo ? " Kit asked . " This  --  quest of yours for Rouge , " Bernardo said in a tone inaudible to Smithers , who stood not two yards away . " You do not intend to tell the men ? " Kit 's firm mouth widened into a slow smile beneath the whitegoldmustache . " No , I do not , " he said . " Always long of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've reached nigh on to forty winters by taking thought , " Bernardo said dryly . " See that you do as well . You have a responsibility to the men , Kit . You can not sacrifice them to your desire to take vengeance on Del Toro or your quest for Rouge . Unless they find enough loot to make the voyage worth while .... 44 " They 'll mutiny , " Kit finished for him . " That I know right well . But consider this , Bernardo : If Rouge is herself seeking treasure , will she not ply the same sea lanes frequented by the Spanish plate ships ? Ca n't we kill two birds with one stone ? " " Yes  --  if you do n't consider it a waste of time to board a Spanish vessel instead of continuing your search ! " Kit gazed upward where the men were swarming amid the rigging , bending the Sea flower 's broad sails to the wind . When he turned back to Bernardo , his eyes were smiling . " When I die , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manor , soft with linen sheets . I have no desire to be hanged , Bernardo . Besides , such limbs as hers should be caressed by silks . What vessels cross our paths , we take . Rest quietly on that score . " " Good ! " Bernardo grunted , and cocked his weather eye aloft . " We 'll make good speed , " he added . " The wind is almost dead astern . " The Sea f lower slid quietly out of the harbor of Basse-Terre and headed westward , along the long arm of the upper peninsula . Bernardo looked down at her knife-sharp prow . Already it was breasted with foam . " The wind will hold , " he observed . It was the season for the trade winds . They could cross the entire Caribbean with a wind that varied no more than three points off dead astern . On the other hand , the Spanish vessels coming from Mexico and Peru would have to tack into the wind . The advantage in speed would be all in their own favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kit had the feeling that luck was with them . The Sea f lower seemed a thing alive , rolling gently with the rising swells , and running before the winds like a great white-winged bird . True , most of the Spanish vessels would lie at anchor in the roadbeds of the Mexican and Peruvian harbors , waiting for the winds to shift . But some of them would start to inch homeward toward Spain . The insatiable maws of the homeland would brook no waiting . Spain was too near disaster to wait long for the treasure that she was tearing from her colonies . The Sea flower 's luck held , and in four months she had capturedand sunk seven Spanish vessels . The booty was excessive , 45the Spanish ships having been loaded with the treasure that was now so urgently needed in Spain . Kit was firmly entrenched with the crew , for in addition to their rich spoils , the losses aboard the Sea f lower had been light . But during all this time there had been no sign of Rouge or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Late one day they espied a dainty caravel , convoyed by a fleet of four Spanish ships of the line . The Sea flower , with her tremendous advantage of speed , bided her time during the late afternoon and early evening , then under cover of night swooped in among the cumbersome ships of the line and cut the caravel out of the miniature armada . When Kit and his men boarded her it was early morning , and she was already listing dangerously . By the time the Sea flower 's crew had combed her for booty and taken the captives aboard , she was heeling for her last plunge into the deep , night-black waters of the Caribbean . Among the captives were two women , whom Bernardo half led , half dragged before Kit , who was standing at the rail . Kit turned to the women . The elder , a lean and formidable matron of some fifty winters , spread her arms as though to shield her charge from his impious glance . Kit put out an arm and set the duenna gently aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the younger , a mere slip of a girl no more than eighteen or nineteen . Bernardo Diaz watched his face keenly . Now , the Jew exulted , now the red-haired witch will be forgotten . If blood flows in his veins , he will forget her for this one ! .. . Kit 's blue eyes , cool and grave , studied the girl before him . She was as slender as a willow sapling and as graceful . Her hair hung loose about her shoulders , as black as a vulture 's wing against the spring snow of her face . Under her slim brows her eyes smoldered blacker even than her hair , and firelit in their depths . Kit watched the corners of her mouth , blood-rose red , tender-soft . Her lips were moving , shaping words , but it was long before their sense came over to him . " I have no English , Senor Captain , " she whispered . " But if you do not know Spanish , I will try French , although poorly . " 46Kit 's mouth spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish will serve , senorita , " he said in flawless Castilian . " Go on . " The girl drew herself up proudly . " I would like to know the meaning of this ! " she said . " What manner of man are you , to wage war upon women ? Why did you sink our ship ? " Kit took a step toward her , looking down on her small face from his great height . " I ask the questions here , " he said quietly . " What is your name ? " And if I do not choose to answer ? " " The senorita will not be so unwise . I should regret having to employ harsh measures . " The girl 's black eyes flashed somber fire . " You would not dare ! " she spat . " Would I not ? " Kit asked softly . Then , turning to Bernardo , he said , " Bring me the whip ! " Bernardo hesitated , searching Kit 's face . But the blue eyes were impassive . Shrugging , Bernardo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lash . Kit slipped the loop over his wrist and played the nine-foot lash out along the deck . The girl hung there , her face ghost-white , staring at it in breathless fascination . " Your name , senorita ? " he said quietly . Mutely the girl shook her head . Kit drew his hand far back , and held it there ; but it was the duenna who broke . " It is Valdiva ! " she screeched . " Do not strike her , you murderer ! You 'll pay for this , just you wait ! The house of Del Valdiva is mighty . " " And so is your tongue , " Kit said wearily , and brought down the whip so that its loaded tip cut through three of the duenna 's many petticoats . The duenna leaped skyward , shrieking . " Tie her up , " Kit commanded . " And gag her . I 'm tired of her noise . " He turned back to the girl . Putting out his hand , he lifted her chin and gazed into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shaking his head , " I 'll not whip you . Your skin is much too lovely to be striped . " The girl jerked her head away angrily . " What is your name ? " Kit asked again . " The rest of it , I mean ? " 47The girl stared up into his face , seeing it pale bronze , the mustache and Vandyke white-gold , the hair gold too , like a great mane about his shoulders , and the plume white above the maroon of his broad-brimmed hat . " It is Bianca , " she whispered . " Bianca , " he muttered , " the fair one  --  it fits . " Bianca del Valdiva stood looking up at him , her black eyes endlessly dark , searching his lean face . " Senor Captain , " she said , " I am innocent . If you plan to be dishonorable toward me , I ask that you take my life instead . " Kit looked at her and slowly , deliberately , began to laugh . " Dishonor you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The girl stiffened as though she had been struck , her warm mouth tightening into a thin line . " Then set me ashore , " she snapped . " I am betrothed to a good and generous man , who will reward you for your kindness . By your speech you are from Spain , though your hair and eyes belie it . Surely you must have heard the name of Don Luis del Toro . " Kit stared at her . Then , slowly , his head came back and laughter crashed from his throat . It was a hard , bitter sound , entirely without mirth . Hearing it , the girl drew back in terror . Her eyes widened . " You  --  you know him ? " she stammered . " Know him ? " Kit echoed . " His stars and mine have been entangled since my youth  --  so much so that I can not pluck a mermaid from the bosom of the sea upon whose hand he has not set his seal . But I have sampled that grandee 's vaunted kindness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a marriage ! " Bianca 's hands flew up like two white birds and covered her ears . Kit stood there a long time , studying her face before he turned away . " Very well , senorita , " he said , " have it your own way . " Then to Bernardo , " Take her to my quarters until I decide what to do with her . " The duenna struggled furiously at her bonds , her lean face livid above the gag that stopped her mouth . The girl looked at him imploringly , her own small face white with terror. 48 " She may have her woman with her , " Kit added . Then he turned on his heel and strode aft . Bianca del Valdiva stood there staring after him , her black brows knit and puzzled . Then as the old shrew joined her Bernardoheard her whisper : " Why does he hate Don Luis so ? " Bernardo took the women to their quarters and left them there . Then he sought Kit . He found him on the poop staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to him , his own dark face twisted with forebodings . " Why , Kit , " he demanded , " have you taken prisoners of no conceivable use to us  --  or of any value . More , they are an actual hindrance and a danger . Is it your intention to revenge yourself on Don Luis by molesting her ? " Kit turned to his friend , a slow smile lighting his eyes . " Truly , my own duenna matches and exceeds hers . Still your long and worried tongue a bit and listen . Ca n't you understand what a stroke of luck this is ? That girl in her own small and dainty person represents half the wealth of Cartagena . " " How so ? " Bernardo growled . " You 're devious , Kit . Explain . " " The girl is dear to Don Luis . Dear enough to bring a ransom of say a hundred thousand crowns . Did you note the emerald on her finger  --  those green stones for which the district about Cartagena is so justly famed ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might it not occasion some concern within his heart ? Followed later by one of her small fingers to speed him ? " " That you would never do ! " Bernardo spat . " Of course not , you know me too well , " Kit sighed . " I would not harm her . In some strange way she reminds me of the other , though God knows there is no similarity between them . " " Except that they are both beautiful , " Bernardo said . Kit looked up , his blue eyes questioning . " Is she ? " he said . " I had not noticed it . " " Your masculinity ! " Bernardo swore . " This one is as beautiful as the angel of dawn moving under the wing of night ! Have you eyes ? Or has that red-haired witch enchanted even them ? " " Yes , " Kit said , " she has . And while she lives , I can see no other woman . " Bernardo frowned thoughtfully , peering out to sea . " This49ransom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how would you manageit ? " " I would leave her under guard at Basse-Terre , " Kit began . " That would be noticed , " Bernardo growled . " And no don would be foolhardy enough to put into Basse-Terre for any reasonwhatsoever . And neither could we enter the Boca Chica in order to deliver her ashore at Cartagena if Don Luis should pay us the ransom . Between the twin fortresses of San Luis and San Jose we 'd be caught like rats in a trap . And the Boca Grande is too shallow to even think of putting in there . " " Therefore , " Kit said , " we must select another cove into which Don Luis might come . What do you think of Cul-de-Sac ? " " Excellent ! He could land in Cuba , then beat straight across the Windward Passage with little danger of being intercepted . Cul-de-Sac is of no importance . The French keep no garrison there . " " All of which Don Luis knows well . What troubles me is that if I give Don Luis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can I then cut his evil throat ? " " He will give you excuse enough , once he arrives . But there are other considerations . Under whose guard would you leave the maid ? " " Yours , of course , Bernardo . " " No , Kit , I know my own desires . The maid is too fair  --  I have a weakness for such . And that ancient she goat , could I restrain myself even from her ? " " You refuse me , then ? " " I must . " " But there is nobody else . Look , Bernardo , these satyrs of mine would ravish the girl , and perhaps even the duenna , by the time we were out of sight of land . " " Then you must stay yourself . "  --  I ?  --  " Yes . I can put the Sea flower across the Caribbean and heave to off the Boca Grande channel while the message is dispatched by dinghy . Meanwhile , you can learn something of the ways of women  --  a lesson that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frowning . " But what about Rouge ? " he growled . Bernardo grinned . " I strongly suspect that by the time we return Rouge will be of scant concern to you . If I am wrong , there will be time and to spare to search for her . Meanwhile , we gain a fortune , and maybe your vengeance too . " " Yes , " Kit sighed , " it is a pleasant thought . " At this moment Bianca put her head through the cabin door . A shaft of sunlight fell across her face , lighting her eyes . Above her snowy skin her hair was blue-midnight jet , startling in its contrast to her fairness . Bernardo leaned close to Kit 's ear . " It will not be too hard to stay , will it , Kit ? " he whispered . " No , " Kit growled , " it will not . " So it was that the helmsman put the whipstaff of the Sea f lower all the way over so that she came about in a wide circle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boom of the foreand-aftsail on the rear mast swung back and forth constantly as the trim vessel tacked into the teeth of the wind . Her progress was necessarily much slower than it had been before , but she still made good speed . They slid by the towns of Leogane and Petit Goave in the night , seeing the lights dim-flaring and yellow beneath the palms . When they had rounded the point of the lower peninsula , the sea was quiet and the dreadful pitching that had kept both the girl and her duenna confined to the quarters that Kit  --  much to the astonishment of his crew  --  had vacated for them ceased . The waters that lay in that blue crescent between the upper and lower peninsulas were well sheltered from the trade winds . The Sea f lower beat eastward through a sapphire sea broken only by the long iridescent swirls of sargasso weed , and now and again by the rainbow flash of a flying fish . The women appeared again on the deck , followed by the eyes of the entire crew . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dark eyes strayed frequently toward his tall figure . Standing there against the deep blue of the southern sky , with the great masses of tawny gold hair spilling down over his51broad shoulders in leonine curls and the trim spike beard and pointed mustache gleaming white-gold in the sunlight , Kit was totally unaware of the confusion he was causing . Bianca 's glances were no longer furtive ; she was gazing at him openly now , a tiny frown marring the smooth expanse of her forehead . Dona Elena , the duenna , leaned close . " Have a care , my girl ! " she said . " You 're making a spectacle of yourself ! " " Oh bother ! " Bianca said . " I do n't care a fig what these ruffians think . " " Nor what he thinks ? " Dona Elena said , jerking her head in Kit 's direction . " Of course not ! " Bianca snapped . " Why should I ? " " That I can not tell . But it is strange that you made me spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a great grandee , a man of parts and property , while this curled and beribboned jackanapes . . . " " Hold your tongue ! " Bianca ordered . " I dress as I please  --  and for my own amusement ! " " That may be , " Dona Elena said gloomily . " All I know is that I left Spain with a pure and innocent maid in my charge , and I wonder what I shall deliver to Don Luis . " Bianca whirled , the tears sparkling in her black eyes . " You wicked old woman ! " she cried . She might have said more , but Kit 's step sounded lightly above the soft wash of the seas , and a moment later he stood before them . He swept off his hat and made them a bow compounded equally of mockery and courtesy . " I trust that the ladies are enjoying their voyage , " he said smoothly . Bianca 's black eyes widened in her pale face . " Enjoying ? " she got out . " We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with only heaven above knowing what fate awaits us ? " Kit 's face was grave and unsmiling . " This is the second time you have mentioned the hideousness of your fate  --  perhaps not in quite the same words , " he said slowly . " On that point I cannotreassure you , not knowing precisely what fate you consider hideous . But if you will permit me , senorita , I might state that you are completely safe from any fate that requires my active personalparticipation , as I am relatively fastidious in such matters . " 52Thereupon he bowed again and was gone , leaving the girl standing white-faced and close to tears . The Sea flower moved quietly into the harbor of Cul-de-Sac . On the shore the palms had taken on a brownish hue , for it was long since it had rained . The waves ran slowly up the white beach between the long seaward-pointing fingers of the mountains , and all the brush was burned and reddish from the heat . The Seaflower 's sails flapped listlessly in a ghost of a breeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fixed in a yellowish-white sky from which every trace of blue was gone , blasted out by the heat . Bianca waited at the rail , gazing at the rows of tumble-down palm-thatched cabins that looked fitter for occupancy by swine than by human beings . She heard the groan of the winch and the splash as the anchor went over the bow into the water . Turning , she faced Kit , one hand nestling at the base of her throat . " We  --  we go ashore  --  here ? " she faltered . " Yes , senorita , " Kit said calmly , " here . " Kit assisted Bianca and Dona Elena into the dinghy , then took his own place . They were rowed in by the old left-handed Welshman who would serve them as servant . Kit had selected him because whatever the man 's intentions , his advanced state of senility made their accomplishment impossible . Bianca sat in the bow of the small boat while the old scoundrel grunted and strained , winking his one good eye at her whenever she glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had pushed its way into the slushy sand , the entire population of Cul-de-Sac turned out to greet them . This consisted for the most part of blacks , with a thin scattering of mulattoes and here and there a white man . The whites were usually old men , buccaneers who had quit the sea or criminals wanted in the larger towns of Hispaniola , come to this God-forsaken hole to die . They were , Kit surmised , no doubt responsible for the mulattoes ; but there were more pressing matters to occupy his attention at the moment . Addressing the populace in French , he made his wants known . In a few moments every able-bodied man was busy in the53erection of two new huts , on a site some distance down the beach from the rest of the town . When they were finished , Bianca noted that they smelled fresh and clean , which was more than could be said for the other huts of Cul-de-Sac . She noticed , too , that Kit and the Welshman had taken up quarters together in one hut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted privacy , at least . She opened her lips to sigh with relief , but the sigh did not come . A little puzzled frown hovered above her eyes . She was safe . Apparently , this outlandish pirate captain meant merely to hold her for ransom  --  this outlandish young captain whose hair was spun gold , and whose eyes were sea water . Her person and her honor were both safe , but she was not relieved . More , she was rather piqued at his indifference ; through her small , intensely feminine mind ran the ghost of a scheme to bring him to heel . Then later on I shall spurn him , she thought . I shall turn aside from him and leave him in the dust like the fool he is ... . She stopped short , her black eyes widening into a night beyond her ken . At the moment she saw Kit coming up the beach toward her , and as she ran into the hut , she was not sure whether it was from Kit she fled or from herself. 54BIANCA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watched the Sea flower putting out to sea . God grant her a safe voyage , she prayed silently , and a speedy return  --  so that I may go home to the good man who is to be my husband before .. . But she stopped her mind before it reached the final thought , and went back into the little hut she was to share with Dona Elena . Sleep , she soon found , was an utter impossibility . Not only was there little abatement of the heat , but the very air sang with swarms of mosquitoes . Her eyelids were soon swollen shut , her lips , her nostrils  --  every exposed portion of her body was a stinging torment of itching , burning welts . Across from her in the darkness , she could hear Dona Elena groaning in her sleep , but the older woman 's age-toughened skin fared better than her own . She sat up on the edge of her hammock , great tears running down her red and swollen cheeks , her ears ringing with the sound and the impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crushed corpses of half a hundred mosquitoes , but among the multitude of their fellows their demises went unnoticed . So busy was she that the man was entirely inside the hut before she noticed him . She stood up with the long swirls of the gown which Kit had presented to her , along with a complete wardrobe  --  snatched , no doubt , from some poor unfortunate 's back  --  sweeping behind her . There was time for the long rasping intake of breath before the rough hands seized her , then she threw back her head and screamed. 55 As the man bore her out on the beach , she heard the swift thud of running feet behind her . Then the heavy bark of a pistol sounded and the ball whined overhead . At once the man dropped her unceremoniously to the sand and sped away in the darkness . Kit strode past her , and took aim again . She got to her feet and stumbled after him . When she reached his side , she said , " You  --  you would kill him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror . " Of course , " Kit said calmly . " What would you have had me do  --  kiss him ? " " I know , but to try to shoot him like a dog . . . " " When men behave like dogs , they should expect a dog 's fate , " Kit said . " But a thousand pardons , senorita . When another such  --  suitor comes , I shall not interfere with your  --  pleasures . Adios . " He bowed then , and started back up the beach toward his hut . Bianca gazed after him , rage and fear contending for mastery within her . Finally fear won . " Kit ! " she cried . " Kit ! " He halted at once . She came running up to him , her young face pale silver in the moonlight under the blue-jet cascade of her hair . " I  --  I 'm afraid ! " she confessed . " He  --  he tried to . . . Oh , Kit , , it was awful , and there might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall not sleep , " he said gently .... " But , Mother of God , what happened to your face ? " " The mosquitoes , " Bianca said . " They 're eating me alive . " " I might be able to help you . Wait a bit . " He disappeared into the doorway of his hut , and reappeared almost at once with a round earthen pot called an olla . In his hand was a thick pile of dried leaves . He crossed to her hut and entered , paying no attention to the hysterical sobs of Dona Elena , who thought he was the would-be ravisher come back again . Kneeling on the floor , he packed the pot with the leaves and ignited them with flint and steel . At once a rich , fragrant smoke curled skyward . " Tobacco leaves , " Kit explained . " And here are more to replenish the olla when these are burned through . That should 56 keep the little beasts at bay . " Then he bowed and went out . Bianca found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  completely successful in driving the swarms of mosquitoes from the hut . So it was that , worn-out by tenor and discomfort , she fell at last into a deep , dreamless sleep . When she woke , the sun was driving a shaft of white heat directly into the window . She got up and dressed hurriedly . Then , followed by the groaning Dona Elena , she sought Kit . She found him surrounded by a council of the town fathers . She heard his voice ring out : " Any other man who dares touch her will not get off so easily . " The men , Bianca saw to her vast astonishment , were nodding their heads in assent . She came up to Kit and took his arm , then dropped it abruptly , her face covered with blushes and confusion . Such a gesture , she realized , had been well enough last night under the cover of darkness and the stress of circumstances , but today , in the sunlight , before the eyes of half a hundred men . . . True @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another man . Strange how remote Don Luis had become ; she was having difficulty in recalling his face . Kit looked down at her , smiling . " I trust you slept well ? " he inquired . " Very  --  thanks to you . " Her tone was much warmer than she had meant it to be , so she hastened to correct it . " Of course , if it were not for you I should have been neither in discomfort nor in danger . " " Alas , " Kit sighed , " that 's all too true . But it will be ended soon . Are you hungry ? By now Jim should have our breakfast ready . " On an open fire before the huts , Jim was boiling palm cabbage in an olla . In another , plantains steamed , while on a flat rock thin cakes made of the sawdustlike flour of the cassava or manioc root were baking . Jim saw them coming , and a wide grin split his toothless countenance . " Come and eat , " he called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve ! " Bianca sank down before the fire on the sand , and after amoment Dona Elena joined them . The older woman was muchthe worse for the heat , but Bianca noticed that it did not affect57her appetite . Bianca tasted the strange fare gingerly at first , then , finding it surprisingly good , ate well . After they had finished , Jim brought them gourds of a pale liquor that tasted like beer . Bianca raised her eyes questioningly . " Veycou , " Kit explained . " They make it from fermented cassava meal . It aids digestion in this heat . " That might well be , Bianca thought , but after having downed half a gourd , she realized that it also aided the mind to giddiness and the heart to levity . For the life of her , she was unable to keep her lips from smiling as she gazed at Kit . This was a very sorry state of affairs . She forced the corners of her mouth down , but they persisted in crawling up again . Kit 's frown deepened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperately , ca n't I stop smiling ? It was at that moment that she felt something very like a white-hot needle entering her arm . She shrieked softly , and Kit bent over , his face filled with concern . With his thumb and forefinger he pulled out the little red insect that was burrowing into her skin . " What  --  what is it ? " Bianca quavered . " Bete rouge , " Kit growled . " It 's a very serious matter . They lay their eggs under the skin and make ulcers . Jim , bring some fat . " Jim disappeared into the hut and returned with a gourd full of thick , vile-smelling hog fat . " Smear it on your face and arms , " Kit commanded . " It willkeep them away during daylight and the mosquitoes at night . " Bianca sat there staring blankly at the evil-smelling mess . " Do as I say , " Kit growled . " I do n't want you to get sick on my hands . " Timidly Bianca stretched forth a hand and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soothing to the skin , despite its smell . Dona Elena did likewise , and afterward Jim and Kit . So began the long days of waiting . This , the chief island of the Antilles , Bianca found , was far from the jeweled isle of romance that the tellers of tales have made of the green chain that dots the Caribbean Sea . In addition to the five thousand varieties of insects , all of which stung or bit , there were the58wild hogs that came rooting through the streets and which charged at the swish of her broad skirts ; there were the wild dogs that howled all night , the hideous-voiced parrots and crows ; there were the pigeons that made it unsafe to sit under the trees , and whose flesh was so tough and bitter that it was impossible to eat it . There were the horses and cows of the townsmen that poked their heads through the windows and frightened her half out of her wits ; and there were the little chickens , the pintadas , which were always underfoot . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great blue herons split the night open with their ugly asslike braying . Moreover , the white skin that all her life she had protected from the hot sun of her native Spain had here no protection from this much hotter sun . She burned bronze , blistered and peeled and burned all over again . Dona Elena kept to her hammock most of the time and this was an additionalburden , for in her loneliness Bianca was forced more and more to seek Kit 's company . His cool courtesy , his almost maddening indifference , were fast becoming a goad she could not resist . If she could have bathed in the sea , it might have been better , but even this method of cooling body and nerves was denied her , because the great dorsal fins of the tiger sharks cut the water in plain sight of land . As she sat now in the partial shade of a wine palm , she could see Kit 's blue eyes gazing at her , and her breath caught deep in her throat . I wonder what he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifetime to know ... . Kit 's thoughts at that moment were black and troubled . The Sea flower should be back by now , he thought . It must come back ! She is so fair , this little one , so soft and so tender . And she is his  --  his ! What concern is that of mine ? There is still Rouge . Hold on to that . Never forget her , never . With her sea-green eyes that slant upward in the corners , her hair like hibiscus petals , and her skin like ewe 's milk . No , never forget her who lay close to me when she thought me dying of her shot and wept out her despair ; do not forget her for Bianca , who belongs to my enemy , who can not be mine  --  for all her unstarred midnight wave of hair and her mouth , soft , tender , 59secret-smiling . . . . He got up abruptly and started down the beach . Bianca stood up and took a step or two behind him , then her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jungle lay thick-tangled , cool and inviting . She started walking , slowly at first , then with gathering speed and deliberation , toward the matted brush . Inside , it was cool and dark , and a few yards from the now invisible beach a little stream ran placidly inland . I 'll follow it , she decided . I can always find my way back ... . So thinking , she moved along the stream until she came to a place where it widened and deepened into a shaded pool beneath a bamboo thicket . The water was slow-moving , clear , and inviting , and the heat lay like a blanket about her head . Without thinking she kicked off her shoes  --  her stockings having long since fallen prey to the sand and rocks on the beach  --  and holding her skirts high , waded into the water . Bianca could not swim . Such an accomplishment would have been unthinkable in a Spanish noblewoman . So she contented herself with wading back and forth in the cool green water , moving so smoothly and quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay like a gnarled log on the dark bottom . She might have kept up her wading indefinitely had she not moved farther out and inadvertently stepped into a hole . She splashed downward , the water coming up to her waist , drenching her garments . " Holy Mother ! " she cried . Then , as the coolness reached her skin , her temper vanished , and she laughed aloud . I 'll take them off , she decided , and really bathe . She started shoreward , held back by the weight of her waterlogged clothing . But the splashing and the laughter had disturbed the ancient cayman . Slowly he moved upward , his rusty snout sliding easily along the surface . Bianca neither saw nor heard him ; she had reached the far end of the pool and put one slim white foot ashore when he reared , bellowing . The girl whirled and hung there a moment frozen as the great jaws , lined with hideous teeth , came open . Then she started to scramble up the bank , and as she gained it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment that the sound of her cry came to him , Kit was standing on the beach a few yards away , peering out to sea with profound relief in his heart , for there on the horizon was the white blob of the Sea f dower 's sails . At the cry , he whirled and plunged into the brush . He saw Bianca floundering toward him amid the snarl of the underbrush , held back by the drenched weight of her clothing . She hurled herself upon him , and through all the layers of her clothes he could feel the pounding of her heart . He heard the crashing noise in the brush , and freed himself of her grasp . Then , as the great , clumsy beast came through , he fired one of his pistols , the shot going straight into the gaping mouth . The alligator thrashed about in a frenzy , flattening the brush for yards around ; then at last it lay still and hideous in death . Kit turned back to Bianca and saw that she was swaying , even her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he drew her to him . She nestled against his chest , her shoulders shaking with sobbing . At long last , she quieted and raised her small oval face . Suddenly , without premeditation or conscious thought , he put down his head and kissed her . It was a gentle kiss , light and tender , entirely lacking in desire . She stood very still with her dark eyes closed , her mouth warm against his . Then very slowly she moved away from him , her eyes coming open , studyinghis face . " Why did you do that ? " she whispered . " Why ? Truly , I do not know , Bianca . " " Ca n't you say it , Kit ? " she murmured . " Ca n't you say what I want most in all the world to hear ? " Slowly he shook his head . " Forgive me , " he said at last . " That was much against my will . . . . Come , the Sea f lower is in sight . " He put out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ averted , the tears rising like jewels over her lashes and spilling down her cheeks . " Do not weep , " Kit said . " It is all over now . " She whirled suddenly and faced him , turning her back toward where the white sails of the brigantine were growing on the 61horizon . She put up both her hands and let them rest lightly on his broad shoulders . " I am betrothed , " she said slowly , " to a good and honorable man . You should not have done that , Kit . You should not have kissed me . For now you force me to acknowledge what my heart has known all along : I love you and none other  --  now and foreverand always , till the day I die ! " Kit looked down at her , bleak pain in his blue eyes . " You must not say that , " he said . " You must not even think it . " " Why not ? " Her eyes sought and held his gaze . " There is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tone . Her words were a statement , flat and controlled and dreadfully calm . " There is Don Luis , " Kit growled . Bianca shook her small head slowly . " No , not Don Luis , " she said . " What is she like , Kit , this woman ? What manner of creature is she ? " Kit looked out past her to where the Sea f lower danced on the horizon . " Like an angel , " he said , " like a witch  --  I can not decide . Her eyes are sea emeralds , her hair Greek fire . She kissed me once as I lay dying and brought me back to life . Her beauty is a wound in my heart that will bleed until I find her again . " Bianca gazed up at him , her eyes diamond-bright . " God speed you in your quest , " she whispered . " I would not have you unhappy for all the world ! " Then , rising on tiptoe , she kissed him , her mouth moving upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone beyond his will , tightened on her waist . Her face was twisted with pain , but she did not resist . At last , slowly , she swung back against his arm , so that he could see the streaks of her tears . He released her almost at once , and stood looking after her as she walked away , her head bent , her slim shoulders shaking . Then he turned back toward the Sea f lower , feeling with a curious sense of finality that never again in life would he know either happiness or certainty or peace. 62KIT STOOD on the beach of Cul-de-Sac with Bianca and Bernardo Diaz and watched the great ship Garza of Don Luis del Toro inching her way over the horizon . " He 's on schedule , " Bernardo growled . Kit said nothing . Instead he turned his head in a half-circle and gazed wonderingly at this sun-stricken , heat-killed land . It was the same , nothing had changed . And yet , magically , everything had changed . The long blue fingers of the mountains that ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were an even paler , more pastel shade , until they seemed suspended in time and space like the sea haze that marked their base . Behind the tiny hamlet , the tangled fringe of marsh and jungle , which ran back for a few score yards until it too was halted by the omnipresentmountains of Haiti , seemed greener than he had rememberedany jungle to be : a dreamscape out of neverland . The Garza beat in across the Windward Passage with majestic deliberation . Of all the multicolored confusions about him , she was the only certainty . Kit glanced down at Bianca , seeing the girl 's face pale and set , her mouth held in a hard line , her black eyes unwavering . Bianca looked up at him and put out her small hand . " Good-by , Senor Cristobal , " she said brightly . " And many thanks for saving me from the ennui of a most tedious voyage . But for you I would have known nothing of piracy , mosquitoes , alligators , and other interesting matters . " Kit took her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow smile . " Is this all you have to say to me ? " he asked . " Yes  --  what I would like to say , I dare not . It would only 635pain you to listen to it , and shame me to say it . This way is better , is n't it ? That we pretend that there was no yesterday . For when you find your Rouge I would not have you troubled by any fleeting memory , by one disloyal word . " " And Don Luis ? What of him ? " " I do my duty , " Bianca answered simply . " I see , " Kit said . Bianca looked up at him , her night-dark eyes soft with tenderness . " I think the world will someday learn great things of you , " she whispered . " I think that you will become a prince  --  how else could you have been born so princely ? And I shall make my final voyage to Cartagena of the Indies  --  out of your life , my Kit . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great grandee . I shall spend all my days forgetting you . And there will come an hour when I shall succeed in the attempt . Do you know when that will be , Kit ? " " No , " Kit said . " When will it be , Bianca ? " " The day I die , " she whispered . Kit put out a sinewy arm and drew her to him . " You have bemused yourself with loneliness , " he said . " I am not the man you think me . Remember what I am  --  a sea rover , brutal , poorly lettered , my soul besmirched into hell with the blood of the innocent , a murderer and a thief , unfit to touch your finger tips . Remember only those things , and forget the wretch who caused you so much pain . " Bianca straightened . " That , never ! " she said fiercely . Bernardo touched Kit 's arm . " He 's coming in now , " he said . " Better get the girl and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , " Kit said . " Jim will take them there . I 'll meet this murderous hidalgo face to face . " Bianca turned and joined Dona Elena , and the two of them followed the wizened little Welshman across the beach to where the thick brush nestled at the foot of the mountains . Kit looked after them for a moment , then turned back to where the Garza 's boat beat through the white wall of the surf toward the pale-gold sand. 64He and his company , which consisted of Bernardo , Patricio , Smithers , and Dupre , walked down to the water 's edge . Without hesitation Don Luis del Toro stepped out into the water , not troubling himself to remove either his black kidskin shoes or his fine silk stockings . He was clad altogether in black , after the fashion of the Spanish nobility , and Kit knew at once that here was an opponent to respect . Don Luis del Toro , though not so tall as Kit , was well above middle height , a compactly built man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beneath the sleeves of his black-velvet doublet , his arms were as big as Bernardo 's , and his shoulders were broader than Kit 's own . His nose jutted boldly from his brown-granite face and his chin , whose deep cleft was hidden by an inky short beard , was heavy after the Hapsburg fashion . His eyes , brown , and deep-set under his heavy brows , rested quietly on Kit 's face . " Where is she ? " he demanded in English . " First let me see the color of your gold , " Kit said in limpid Castilian . Don Luis leaned forward , peering intently into Kit 's face . " I have seen you before , " he growled . " But where ? " " Many times , " Kit told him , " over the barrel of a gun . In Cadiz , when you whipped my mother with your lash . In the harbor of Cadiz , after your people had taken her life . Off Port Royal , when you made pretended rescue an excuse for ravishment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bound by a safe-conduct to spare you . But enough of this . Where is the money ? " Don Luis nodded to one of the helmeted and cuirassed soldiers who attended him . The man stepped forward , grunting under the weight of an oak chest . When it had been opened , the dull gleam of the roughhewn pieces of eight gleamed dully in the sunlight . Kit picked up a few of the heavy coins , minted at Lima in Peru from a single heavy bar of gold , and all of them so roughly cut that there was not one of them that was truly octagonal , or bore all the letters of the inscription . He felt the sharp edge where the chisel of the mint worker had hacked the single coins away from their fellows , and hefted them65for their weight . They were up to standard or even heavier , weighing as much as a hundred and eighteen grams rather than the hundred and thirteen specified by law . " Fetch the girl , " he said to Bernardo . All this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the grandee 's countenance was an expression less of anger than of regret  --  a look of baffled pride oddly commingled with admiration . " You are as I should have expected you , " he said , " knowing whence you sprang . But , Cristobal , I did not order your mother 's execution . Indeed , I pleaded for clemency . But the authorities of the town were overzealous . In this I crave your indulgence , and ask that I be not blamed . " " You lie in your teeth ! " Kit spat . Don Luis shrugged resignedly . " That the cub roars and has fangs I should have known , " and he sighed , half to himself . Then his brown eyes lighted , for Bianca was coming down the beach , her face pale and colorless , her lips unsmiling . Kit watched Don Luis sweep her into his great arms . This is nothing to me , he told himself ; but a slow , deep feeling of sickness curled at the pit of his stomach . He noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the grandee 's kiss just missed her mouth . " He has not harmed you ? " Don Luis growled . " And if I had ? " Kit spat . " You would die , " Don Luis said simply . His tone was quite empty of emphasis or of any quality of threat . It was as though he were discussing the weather  --  a statement of fact so calmly , so confidently self-evident that Bianca 's heart turned over within her . " No , Luis , " she said quickly , " he has not harmed me . Save for the abduction , he has been the soul of courtesy . " Don Luis studied Kit 's face , as though to inscribe it on his memory . " You have your gold . Have we your leave to depart ? " " Yes , " Kit said . " Depart and be damned ! " A slow smile played across Don Luis 's dark face . " We shall see upon whose head the damnation will fall , " he said quietly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl loosely in the66circle of his embrace . But at the last moment she whirled , freeingherself with one swift motion , and ran back to where Kit stood . She swayed before him on tiptoe , the light in her dark eyes shifting behind the bright film of her tears . " Good-by , Kit , " she whispered . " God speed you , and guide you , and bring you every happiness . " Then she was gone , running back toward where Don Luis waited , his face as black as a thundercloud . Kit said no word . Instead he turned back to his company and said very softly : " To the Sea flower . There is work to be done . " The Garza was still big on the horizon when the winches of the Sea flower drew her anchor free of the blue water . The white sails unfurled beneath the yardarms , dropping downward until the light breeze bellied them out and the great fore-andaftsail on the mainmast filled , the boom swung far over . Effortlessly , the sleek brigantine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving it drifted in pale light-filled , rainbow-hued mists . " You 've done well , " Bernardo said . " By this one coup you 've gained us more than on all our last voyage . " Kit did not answer ; he was peering at the Garza , drifting almost motionlessly on the sun-filled sea . Then he knitted his brows . " Yes , " he said softly , " but we have not yet brought home our treasure . Look , Bernardo . " Bernardo squinted against the light , following Kit 's pointing finger with his gaze . " Fiends and whoresons ! " he got out . " I knew that dog of a grandee was not to be trusted . " Kit looked out frowning toward the end of the harbor , where the twin lines of war vessels were converging , each of them coming from opposite directions , from behind the long blue fingers of the mountains . From one side four ships of the line came , from the other , three . Quietly he called Smithers to his side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gunners to their stations . Stand by to repel boarders. " 67 " If we could gain the open sea , " Bernardo groaned , " we might have a chance . But bottled up here , we are doomed ! Of what avail is the Sea f lower 's speed in this deathtrap of a harbor ? " " If we can force them to break that line . . . " Kit mused . " They are not fools , " Bernardo snapped . " The trap was well baited and better sprung ! " Smithers came up on the forecastle and faced Kit . " Begging the Captain 's pardon , " he began , " I have an idee . " " Then speak , man ! " Kit roared . " Them dons draw twice and three times the water as us . Now if we was to put back into the harbor , they 'd have to come in after us . Inside , they 'd run aground as sure as all hell  --  leastwiseenough of ' em to let us out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Smithers , " he said . " They mount basilisks and long culverins aplenty  --  with chaces of sixteen and twenty feet . They could stand out so far that only our one basilisk could hit them  --  and what good would an occasional hit with a fifteen-pound roundshot do us ? " " From that distance they could n't throw heavier ! " Smithers argued . " Yes , but how many could they hurl to our one ? Even fifteen-pound shot will smash the Sea flower to pieces if she 's hit with one every ten seconds . " " Yet if we go out , " Bernardo mused gloomily , " they 'll lay on a broadside with sixty-four-pounders  --  full cannon , Kit . Four such shots as they throw can sink us . Suppose we were to lie low and wait for night . In the darkness , perhaps . . . " " It 's our only chance , " Kit growled . " But pray God there is no moon ! " At Smithers ' shouted order the helmsman came about on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish vessels . Then she put all the way about and headed back into the harbor . As she neared the shallow water , every man aboard her held his breath . The helmsman put her about again , and she started a slow glide across the harbor , again parallel to the Spaniards , but in water so shallow that they could not follow her . Now was the time for action , Kit knew . If the Spaniards68were seamen , they would kill the Sea flower in a matter of hours . All they needed to do was to close in until their immensely long and slim basilisks and long culverins were in range and they could pound her to pieces , entirely without risk to themselves . These long guns threw a very small shot , but they hurled it by such an immense weight of powder through such long barrels that they could outrange guns throwing shot of almost six times greater weight . The Sea flower had only one such gun aboard , mounted in her bow as a chase gun ; but the seven Spaniards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spaniards came in before night , the brigantine was doomed . But to Kit 's immense relief , they did not break their line . They continued to patrol the entrance to the harbor with majestic deliberation , crossing and recrossing the open mouth of the cuplike declivity between the Haitian hills . Smithers ordered a ration of rum to give the men courage , but neither Kit nor Bernardo touched it . The day dragged on . The sun burned red as blood on the western horizon . Imperceptibly , it dropped to the water 's edge , laying a track of orange and scarlet across which the Spanish ships crawled like black water spiders . The pastel-blue of the mountains became pale violet , then royal purple , then they lay night-black against the bloody blaze in the western sky . Kit could see the black-crowned silhouettes of the palms leaning over against the deepening blue of the night , then the sky darkened until they were drowned in night , blackness upon blackness , and the great stars rode the bosom of the sea . He had turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's groan . Above the reappearing edge of the mighty hills , the great pale-yellow disk of the moon was rising . It grew brighter . The palms stood up again , crowned in silver , the sky silvered into grayness , the water was like the vats of the Peruvian mints , a hard white blaze so bright that on the Sea flower 's decks one could have read the finest print without difficulty . Kit looked around him , seeing the twin fingers of the mountainsrunning darkly down into the sea , the black-trunked , blacksilver-crownedpalms bending seaward before the trade winds , 69the night soft and slumberous with spring , the breeze perfumeladenwith all the flowers of Hispaniola , singing down across the bay toward where the dark outlines of the vessels of death passed and repassed in the moon-silvered night . What a night on which to die , he thought . Turning to Smithers , he said quietly : " You may crack on all sail , Mr. Smithers . " Bernardo came up to Kit and put out his hand . " You 're a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen many who bowed to odds  --  and died in the torture chambers and under the lash . There is no shame in death on the high seas when a man goes down with all guns blazing . I am proud to go that way , and with you . " Without a word , Kit took the great hand . Then he went into his cabin . A moment later he returned , bearing the Sea flower 's pennant  --  a great golden hawk on a field of blue . He gave it to Bernardo . " Bernardo , " he said , " nail our colors to the mast , so that no man among us may strike them ! " The Sea flower stood out from the harbor with the wind quartering off her stern . And out there in the silver blaze of the moon track the Spanish vessels waited . " Hold your fire , " Kit commanded , " until we are too close to miss . We will take one at least of them with us this night . " Cannily , the helmsman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sailing her dangerously inshore , so that before the Spaniards saw her , she was among them . She slid into line so close to one of the great vessels that a stone could have been hurled by hand to the Spaniard 's decks without great effort . Kit 's hand came down , and all of the Sea flower 's port guns spoke at once , making bass thunder , every shot going home . Kit saw the Spaniard 's masts crashing down , bringing with them a wild tangle of sailcloth and cording , and something like hope awoke in his heart . On the impact of the recoil the guns leaped back to the limits of the breeching rope . " Point-blank range ! " Kit roared , and the gunners lifted their hammers , knocking the elevating quoins from beneath the trucks of the guns . As the wedge-shaped pieces of hardwood fell70free , the muzzles of the guns dropped until they were pointing at the water line of the reeling Spaniard . The other vessels stood by , unable to fire their guns for fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower lay so close to the ship of the line that such nicety of aim by the Spaniards was practically impossible . Again Kit gave the signal to fire , and the broadside boomed out , shaking the ocean . Plainly , through the echoes after the fire , Kit could hear the crash of the Spaniard 's timbers and the screams of her dying crew . Then , to his amazement , a glow of fire showed amidships of the Spanish vessel . Hungrily , it ran upward into the broken rigging ; in three minutes the whole vessel was ablaze . This , Kit saw at once , was a stroke of ill luck , for what illumination the moon had so far failed to give was now provided by the blazing Spaniard . The Sea f lower lay in the middle of the Spanish fleet , etched starkly against the dancing flames . At once the Spaniards opened up with their great cannon , splitting the night asunder . Kit could see the yellow tongues of fire probing the dark for the range , then afterward sea and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ echoes reverberatingendlessly among the encircling hills . White geysers stood up like momentary columns all about the Sea f lower while she fought back , giving them shell for shell . Such was the accuracy of her fire that in a few minutes not one of the Spanish vessels remained unhurt . But the Spaniards were getting the range now . A blinding explosion of fire , water , and oak splinters filled the air not ten yards from where Kit stood . He saw four of his gunners crumple like broken dolls beside their pieces , the pale scrubbed surface of the planking running thick and red with their blood . Beside them one of the demicannon had overturned on its carriage , lying grotesquely on its side with the wooden wheels still spinning . Another ship veered into a parallel track , and swept the Sea f lower 's deck with a hail of small shot . When she had passed , less than half of the brigantine 's crew were on their feet . Kit saw Dupre sitting on the deck , his linstock flaring beside him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guts back into the gaping wound in his belly . He sat there a long time , 71pushing desperately with both hands , not uttering a sound , until at last his hands were too slippery with his own blood to be any longer effective . Then he let his intestines spill out , and sat staring at them glumly , with an expression of acute disgust on his round , swarthy face that did not change even after he died . It was only when a forty-eight-pounder hit the Sea flower squarely , causing her to roll and sending him over limply on the deck , that Kit knew he was dead . " Mother of God , " Kit muttered , " why do n't they sink us and get it over with ? " But the Spaniards continued to slash at the brigantine with small shot , killing her crew one by one until less than two dozen men remained on their feet , and of these not one was unwounded . Kit and Bernardo were but slightly hurt , only cut in five or six places by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whipstaff , so that the trim vessel veered aimlessly , losing steerage , wallowing helplessly in a trough of the sea while the Spanish men-of-war went by her one by one in a beautiful line and raked her decks . Kit heard at last that most hideous of all sounds to a seaman , the splintering crash of a broken mast ; then almost at once another , so that the Sea flower lay naked on the bosom of the sea , denuded of her white wings , unable to gain headway . He looked around at Bernardo , blackened like himself from head to foot with gun soot . Only the flesh about their eyes showed white , streaked here and there with the rivulets of their own blood . Kit put out his hand and Bernardo took it . He stood there with the young captain whom he had followed and counseled and guided across half a world , waiting for the death that both of them knew was imminent . And looking into Bernardo 's eyes , Kit saw no fear . It was a long moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firing . They turned as one man , peering through the deafening silence to where the gigantic bulk of the Garza bore down upon them . The huge ship of the line rose in close and the grappling hooks dropped into place . Kit saw Don Luis , splendid in a coat of mail , climb down to the Sea flower 's decks , followed by a score of soldiers . Of Kit 's men , 72there was not one left with either the strength or the will to oppose them . Stiffly Kit and Bernardo advanced to meet the grandee . The moonlight glinted blue-silver on the armor , and white on the great plumes above the helmets . The Spaniards were a brave sight . Kit glanced from them to the broken bodies of his dead and tired , sooty , wounded living ; the rage and humiliation in his breast was like white fire and poison . Don Luis 's even white teeth showed brilliant in his dark face . His big hand came up and gave his short beard a contemplativetug . " You fought well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know could have stood us off so long . " " Words ! " Kit spat . " Do with us what you will , and have done with it ! " " Be not overhasty , " Don Luis said calmly . " I require of you only the ransom money . Where is it ? " Kit 's blue eyes widened in his soot-blackened face . He nodded to Bernardo . The Jew started off and returned after a few moments with the chest . " Open it , " Don Luis commanded . Kit 's tired , stiffened fingers worked clumsily with the lock . When at last it was opened , the gold pieces glinted dully in the light of the moon . " Take it up , " Don Luis said to one of the soldiers . The man bent and grunted under the weight of the chest . Don Luis raised his sword to the visor of his helmet and saluted Kit . " Adios , " he said softly . " And when you remember your mother , remember also that I spared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went back up the ratlines to the Garza , leaving Kit and Bernardo standing there caught in a vast stupor of astonishment . " Mother of God ! " Kit whispered . " Why in the name of everything holy did he spare us ? " " We shall know someday , " Bernardo muttered . " But come now , we must bind up the wounded and bury the dead . " Nevertheless , Kit remained motionless , watching the long line of men-of-war beating out to sea , moving slowly , silently past73the place where their fellow blazed , bloodying the sea and the sky with the ruddy glow of the flames . Then at last he wentdown the splintered , slippery deck , moving stiffly , automatically , his eyes blank and unseeing. 746KIT SAT on the beach before Cul-de-Sac with his elbows resting on his knees and his two hands toying with the soiled and bloodstained folds of the Heron Banner . He was almost completelymotionless , his blue eyes staring blankly out to sea , while behind him people of the village were digging a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossed . Bernardo Diaz looked at him , seeing his whole body freighted with abject dejection . He crossed quietly to where Kit sat and laid a kindly hand on his shoulder . Kit looked up quickly into Bernardo 's dark face . " Bernardo , " he said , " I 've been a fool ! " " That 's the beginning of wisdom , " Bernardo remarked . " But then , what man is not ? " " But none so complete , so colossal a fool as I. I am the crown prince of asses . " " And I , " Bernardo grinned , " am your prime minister ! " Some of the moroseness left Kit 's face at Bernardo 's remark . " He has bested us again , " he said slowly . " Whenever we meet , he is always the victor . Why is it so , Bernardo ? " " Because he is older and wiser . You must fight him with his own weapons , Kit . When your tongue has become as forked as his , when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kit stared at Bernardo , his blue eyes narrowing in his tanned face . " In my hands , " he said , " I had the instrument of his destruction . I could have made a cuckold of him before his vows were said , delivered to him a used baggage , deflowered , dishonored , damned ! Whenever he looked at her , whenever his hands touched her flesh , he would have been faced with the75thought that here were my leavings . Only , Bernardo , she was so fair  --  so gentle and so fair . " " All the better , " Bernardo growled . " A forced maid freezes up her loins to pleasure , but one as willing as she so plainly was redoubles your joy with the fury of her passion . If it had been I , I would have set my mark upon her flesh so that he could never forget it ! " Kit studied Bernardo gravely . " He has wronged you too , " he mused , " as grievously , almost , as myself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dryly , " that the records of my conversion , my baptismal papers , are recorded in the cathedral . Only by forgetting could he appropriate for his own purposes my houses and lands and my ships . And on what pretext ? That I am a Jew , a fact I can help as littleas he can help being the Spanish grandee he is . But enough of this . What now , Cristobal ? " Kit stood up suddenly . " First , " he said , " we must cut a mast and erect a jury rig to take us back to Tortuga . Then we will commence anew . " He looked at Bernardo , his forehead creased with frowning . " I shall put to sea again , " he said slowly , " and skirt the coast until I devise some method of luring Del Toro from behind those walls of Cartagena which now so effectively protect him . During this time of waiting , I must take ships , many ships , and pile up a mountain of gold . For when I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her beauty . " " So you would still find your Rouge ? I had thought that perhaps this other had ... " " Shaken me in my purpose ? " Kit frowned . " No , Bernardo , in this I remain unshaken , though someday I shall perhaps discover why the thought of Bianca as the wife of that swart beast makesa taste like rotten mangoes in my mouth . But come , time enough later for thinking . " The task of making the Sea flower seaworthy was not an easy one . Before a day was gone , Kit was forced to give up the idea of duplicating her original rig . His crew was sullen and badtempered , held back by their wounds , but held back even more by their renewed conviction that the Sea flower was indeed a hell ship , cursed with misfortune at her launching . Fortunately76for Kit , they had neither the strength nor the will for open mutiny , so that finally the Sea f lower limped back into the harbor at Basse-Terre , her green unseasoned mast bending before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along at a rate of speed so unbelievably slow that often Kit was in doubt as to whether or not she moved at all . Were it not for the singing perfection of the lines that her French builders had so lovingly shaped , the Sea f lower would have been unmanageable . As it was , she barely maintained steerageway . Night and noon and morning Kit and Bernardo had scanned the horizon , fearing the appearance of a line squall , or even mildly heavy seas , or most of all the chance passing of an English or Spanish vessel . But the gods of mischance had had their fill , The low , humpbacked form of Tortuga rose over the rim of the ocean , and grew with a slowness that crawled along Kit'staut nerves . But when the entrance to the harbor of Basse-Terre was in sight , Bernardo sought Kit out , a most impious grin stretching his swarthy countenance . " Kit , " he said , " do you know what will happen when these rascals of ours go ashore ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tale of our misfortunes and we will not be able to obtain a crew of blind men , boys , and women , let alone seamen . " " That must be prevented , " Bernardo said cheerfully . Kit let his gaze rest on Bernardo 's face , wrath gathering in his blue eyes . " And how would you do that , my good Bernardo ? Put them in irons , so that they ca n't go ashore ? Or perhaps we should heave them overboard at this point ? " " That , " Bernardo grinned , " is a pleasing thought , considering their actual worth . . But I have a milder suggestion . Think a moment , Kit . Why do these he goats go to sea ? " " To obtain gold , " Kit said . " Yes  --  but do they love gold for itself , or for what it can buy ? " Kit 's frown relaxed , recognition lighting his eyes . " I follow your drift , " he said . " If they go ashore hurt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drunkenness or the favors of women , that is one thing , but ... " 77 " Shall I summon them ? " Bernardo inquired quietly . " Yes ! Call them up . You are always long of head , Bernardo ! " In a few minutes the survivors of the battle stood sullenly before Kit . Most of them were clad in rags , and all of them displayed filthy , blood-caked bandages . They stood in a waveringline , their eyes filled with cold hostility . " Men , " Kit began , the ghost of a smile hovering about his mouth , " our luck has been bad , fiendishly bad . But that you know right well . " The crew stood there silently , the hostility in their eyes unwavering . " Our misfortune , however , was not due to any fault of yours . You fought well and bravely . We were outnumbered and beaten . That is no disgrace . Because it was no fault of yours , because you did your part and more , I can not permit you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will receive your pay . Moreover , tonight at the Hotel des Boucaniers we will celebrateour late defeat , and our coming victories  --  at my expense . Of course , if any of you are not disposed to accept ... " The crew turned incredulous faces toward one another , their lean , bearded jaws dropping open . Then the look of amazement was replaced by slow-dawning joy . Smithers stepped out of line . " Cheers for our Cap'n ! " he bellowed . " The best what ever sailed the seas ! " The men responded , roaring out their cheers in half a dozen tongues . Kit smiled quietly . " When we go ashore , " he added , " say nothing to the people . Within the hour you shall have your pay . Back to your places now ! " The men leaped to their stations . The Sea f lower crawled into the harbor . " In this expense , " Bernardo declared , " I shall share , since it was I who suggested it . " Kit shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I must take the responsibilities , since I am captain . " Bernardo grinned at him . " We will need new masts , new sails , new cording . There is ten days of work here for a shipwright 78and ten sea carpenters . You have n't enough for the twin necessitiesof these repairs and conciliating the crew . Whether you like it or not , you must accept my help . " Kit looked toward the quays of Basse-Terre , growing slowly before the Sea flower 's slim prow . " You are a good friend , Bernardo , " he said quietly . The rest of the day passed quickly . Kit went out to the small monastery where the good Fathers kept his gold . For this service , they received a handsome yearly offering that served the wants of many of Basse-Terre 's sick , poor , and aged . To those who censured them for receiving money gained in so barbaric a fashion , the friars said frankly that the good they so selflessly did with the gold at least balanced the evil incurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shipwright were swarming over the hull of the Sea flower , healing her hurts with sound , seasoned timber . On the morrow they would begin to erect her tall new masts . As for the crew , they were already half-drunk , noising abroad in the streets and the alleys the news of Kit 's generosity . And many a stout fellow was already turning over in his mind the advantages of shipping aboard her once she was ready to sail . That night at the Hotel des Boucaniers the noise of revelry beat deafeningly on Kit 's ears . He sat a - little apart , cool amusementlighting his eyes . A slim , dark creature who had spent her childhood cutting purses in the streets of Marseille lay beside him , her head pillowed in his lap . On his right , the blonde Bretonne sat quietly , one arm encircling his broad shoulders . That neither of them had so far gained the advantage was the only thing that kept them relatively at peace . A tall beaker of cane rum rested almost untasted in his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew well , but there was somethingfitting in the knowledge . Gold gained from the bosom of the sea had a quality like quicksilver , running in bright drops through the open hand . As for Bernardo Diaz , he joined gleefully in the riot . The gold he had gained at the risk of his life was now gone to the last sou , yet that seemed exquisitely comic to his richly ironic mind. 79He laughed as loud as any of them , and pinched bottoms and took kisses , his broad , clean-shaven chin red with the rum of the Antilles . He had already chosen a woman to ensure that he would not spend the balance of the night in thinking or in vain regrets . The revel lasted late . When it was over at last , Kit walked on the moon-silvered beach under the slim-trunked palms  --  alone . Now , as always , he took out the tattered , bloodstained pennant about whose somber symbol so much of his life had revolved . The moonlight fell on the wings of the Black Heron , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poised for flight . And all that had been clear before was unclear now , murky and confused . He could imagine Don Luis sitting now in his house in Cartagena , bastion of the Indies , a city whose walled strength could not be matched anywhere on earth either in the Old World or in the New . At one time that had meant little to Kit ; he would have climbed over the walls and laid down his life gladly for the privilege of first flinging the hated grandee into hell . His hatred of Del Toro had in no degree diminished , but he was checkmatedby his own new-found desire to live . And for that , Rouge was responsible . " Rouge . " Saying the name alone was enough to start kettledrumsin his blood . Like white fire in his mind was the image of her swaying before him on the Sea flower 's deck , the few tattered rags the Spaniards had left her clinging to her figure : sea-foam whiteness of hip and thigh , and breasts so proud that they flaunted their conical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poppy-petaled , a trifle full and petulant , self-willed , spirited ; the shell-pink lobes of her nostrils flaring , and above them the oddly Mongolian slant of her emerald eyes beneath the flame of her soft-curling hair . Before Rouge he had fed his soul on hatred , and battened on dreams of vengeance . Now , because of her , whole new vistas were opened up to him : he heard the ring of hammers and the rasp of saws and in his mind saw the vast edifice that would be her domain erected in fair and pleasant fields ; his eye piled up vague , half-imagined furnishings of unbelievable richness  --  silks8osoft enough to caress her skin , velvets , satins , jewels whose glitter paled the noonday sun . These he would tear from the holds of the Spanish plate ships , and lay in mounds at her feet . This would he do  --  after Luis del Toro was dead by his hand , his house in ashes about him , his Bianca widowed . Kit stopped short , his face heavy with frowning . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing there on tiptoe before him , her dark eyes tear-bright , filled with hauntingsweetness , with poignant , almost insufferable longing ; he could see the clean , innocent outlines of her ethereal young face framed in the soft night cushion of her hair . Bianca was an angel out of heaven , too beautiful to touch or believe ; Rouge was born to sear a man 's mind into fevered disorder  --  and he , Kit , was after all mere flesh and blood . Of this he must not think too much . That way lay madness . " Rouge , " he whispered to the night wind , " come back to me  --  for I am no fit consort for a saint . But you and I could make suchjoy on earth that angels looking down would desert their starry thrones . We could spin sunlight into garments , and wear the blue water like sapphires . " His mood changed suddenly and he groaned . This was madness . Rouge was far beyond his reach , or indeed she might even be dead . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muffled booming of the sea . It was a far , sad sound , not unlike the music of a dirge . Above his head the palm trees caught the sea wind and talked in dark voices . Somewhere inland , a parrot screeched hideously , making a sound like demented laughter . Slowly , Kit walked up the beach , his high red heels kicking up little spurts of sand that caught the moonlight like silver as he moved . His head bent and troubled , he returned to the town , which lay buried deep in quiet and in slumber. 8aTHE Sea flower swung southward down the chain of the Antilles , speeding like a great white-winged bird past islands strung like emeralds on a string looping in a great curve toward South America . To Kit 's ears , even their names were like jewels : Hispaniola , Puerto Rico , Guadeloupe , Martinique , Granada , Santa Lucia , Trinidad . . . . And the sea that they encircled  --  cupped by them between the green poniard that is Florida and the long , rugged arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mexico and the towering peaks and mighty rivers of the mainland  --  was like sapphire , topaz , lapis lazuli . Wherever she went , into whatever waters she pushed her prow , the Sea flower left a trail of broken ships bloodying the blue waters with the ruddy glow of fires as they flamed downwardto destruction . From as far north as the mouth of the Mississippi to as far south as Rancherias , where the Rio de la Plata sweeps downward through the pampas of the Argentine into the sea , the black-hulled brigantine pulled down her prey . True , she confined her attention to the galleons of Spain , but this discrimination was but little dictated by gallantry . Kit hoped one day to settle in France or in one of the French colonies , and hence wanted no black mark on his record . He spared the English , in part because they were fellow countrymen of Lazarus and Rouge , but more because they were almost without exceptionprivateers embarked on the same errand as his own . The Dutch with their cargoes of hides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all ; but the Spaniards bore bullion of gold and tons of silver plate , and he hated them with all his heart . By mid-March of 1694 , his name was known and feared82throughout the Caribbean wherever the Spanish tongue was spoken . He flew the banner of the Golden Hawk , like his golden , lionlike mane . Men spoke of the fury of his attack , of his cold and smiling ferocity . But the ones who could speak with any authority were few indeed , for they owed their lives to occasional lapses on the part of Kit 's crew , who , being men and thus liable to error , sometimes failed to make sure that the Spaniards they left on the decks of the plate ships were all dead . It was not a thing that happened often . Kit stood on the deck , his fingers moving softly over the cloth-of-gold sash that encircled his waist . The wings of the Black Heron on it spread fanwise over the bulge made by the barrels of his pistols . His blue eyes were cloudy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was thinking , at the moment , of his mother . After the usual surge of pain at the memory of the cruelty of her death , older questions rose to plague him . How had she come to Cadiz , this gentle , lovely woman , as blonde and fair as her Norse ancestors who had settled centuries ago on the northern shores of France ? Why , in the name of God and the Virgin , had she ever come to be married to that posturing peasant , Pierre Labat ? That Pierre did not deserve his distaste Kit knew well , for with all his unmanly fussiness , he had treated Kit most kindly . He had adored the lovely aristocratic woman who had become his wife , and had provided for both Jeanne and Kit well , having made money as hairdresser and wigmaker to the grandees of southern Spain . They had come to him from as far away as Valencia and Barcelona to have their great blue-black manes fashionably curled ; and those afflicted with baldness paid him princely sums for the magnificent wigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his small way , Pierre Labat had been an artist , but he had never wholly recovered from his awe at finding himself married to a gentlewoman of Normandy . If he had remained in his native France , that would have been beyond his wildest dreams . Kit suspected that he himself was the cause of that particular mystery , for it was more than certain that Pierre Labat had never sired him . His own lean and towering height had never sprung83from that fat little dwarf Labat ; nor did the fine , chiseled purity of line of his features bear any resemblance to the pudgy countenanceof his foster father . There had been about Cristobal Gerado from his earliest youth an arrogance and a swagger that bespoke proud Spanish blood . Bernardo , Kit was certain , knew in part or entirely the answers to these riddles , for he had been a fast friend of Jeanne Giradeaux from that long-past day when she had first set foot on the shores of Spain . It was characteristic of Jeanne that she had never wavered in her regard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " new Christian , " as the converted Jews were called , could be done only at considerable risk to herself . In the Spain of 1689 , there were no others . Masses were being said in the former synagogues , and thousands of these brave and faithful people lay in indistinguishable heaps in common graves outside half the cities of Castile and Aragon . Pierre Labat had almost fainted in pure terror each time Bernardo had approached his door , but both Kit and Jeanne had stoutly championed his right to enter as a friend . The father-and-son relationship had existed between Kit and Bernardo for as long as he could remember . Kit had lavished on that stout , battle-scarred old campaigner the devotion he instinctively withheld from the effeminate Labat . Yet even this was not enough to make Bernardo divulge any secrets . " Some things , " he growled , when asked , " are better left unknown . " And neither threats nor persuasion could move him from his stand . Kit had half-turned toward Bernardo , but now he turned away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bianca . Why was it that the idea of Bianca as the wife of Del Toro was so distasteful to him ? What precisely was the emotionthat he still felt toward that soft and lovely creature ? Was it love ? How was it possible for a man to love two quite dissimilarwomen at one and the same time ? He could see them both as vivid as life before his eyes , both with their sea-foam whiteness of skin and matchless loveliness . But where Rouge 's snowy body was complemented by the hibiscus fire of her head , the vulture-feathered blackness of Bianca 's hair made her fair-84ness doubly startling by contrast . Bianca was a song in the darkness , solace to a man 's wounded spirit ; Rouge was brush fire and volcanoes beneath spring snow . And he , God help him , loved them both ! In that moment a confusion that had long been troubling him was suddenly made clear . Why had he not , after so long a time , made good his vengeance on Del Toro ? He realized that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolhardy , rimmed as that grim gray city was with mountainous walls of stone ; but subconsciously he had been troubled by Bianca , and the declaration of devotion she had made to him . If he killed his enemy , would he not of necessity be forced to assume the responsibility of Bianca ? And however delightful that prospect might seem , what , then , of Rouge ? Rouge was in his blood . The mention of her name was a kind of autointoxication . If only I had been born a Mussulman , he thought bitterly , I could have them both ! .. . He was , he was beginning to realize , driven by fierce surges of emotion that often ran quite counter one to the other , for besides the fact that he loved two women , and hated Don Luis with a hatred as bottomless as the pit , yet another current surged within him , no less strong than the others : a powerful , mounting tide of ambition . His boyhood had been spent under a cloud of mystery , in humble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatness . Wealth ? He had that . No , it was more than wealth that he desired . It was a name that men would reckon with , holdings spreading out from horizon to horizon , and tall sons of his loins to carry on his name . Those sons  --  would they wear manes of scarlet on their heads , or would their scalps be crowned with night-black curls ? That thought again ! Angrily , he put it from his mind , and turned to planning the details of his manor , picturing it lovingly in his mind , furnishing it room by room with all the luxuries he had ever seen or heard of . The furniture would be hand-carved and brightly gilded , and on the back of each chair would be carved his crest . That thought brought him up short ; a low , mocking laugh escaped his lips . His crest ! What heraldic device could he employ ? The bar sinister across an empty shield ? Nameless , 85fatherless bastard that he was , what escutcheon had he upon which to charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the plunderer bird ? He threw back his head to laugh aloud , but at that moment the unmistakable slow-rolling boom of gunfire came to him . He turned to Bernardo , but there was no need to ask . Bernardo was bending forward , his nostrils quivering , his whole body at attention . " Crack on all sail , " Kit ordered . It was still daylight when they came on the scene . A Iow , black-hulled corvette stood in the midst of three huge plate ships and hammered at the gigantic vessels as though her crew were possessed of the fiends . Kit had no need to give the order , his men were already at their stations . One plate ship was a windfall that a man dreamed about for years , but three ! Into these great ships the Spaniards crowded the plate and bullion that had once made up the cargo of a fleet of galleons , on the theory that one ship was more likely to escape detection than a fleet . This theory was quite correct  --  it was hellishly difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ocean . These ships , no doubt , were loaded to the gunwales with silver from Peru , which was explanation enough of the fury with which the corvette fought . But without aid the little vessel did not have a chance . True , the plate ships were not handy fighters  --  the small buccaneer was escaping their fire with mocking ease  --  but neither could the light guns of the corvette dent their heavy timbers . After a while she would be forced to give up . The Sea flower swept down on the battle like a white-winged bird . When she was within range , Kit concentrated her fire on the plate ships ' rigging . In four broadsides , the Sea flower demasted two of the great Spaniards . Seeing this , the third struck her colors . At once the Sea flower 's crew swarmed over the sides and began the labor of bringing the heavy pigs and plates of silver topside . While they were thus gleefully engaged , the corvette slid to the opposite side of the Spaniard , and her crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutlasses and pistols were drawn as the Sea flower 's crew prepared to defend their spoils. 86Seeing the approaching trouble , Kit swung down to the Spaniard'sdeck . " Hold ! " he cried . " There is enough for us all . We will share it with you . " " Who said anything about sharing ? " a voice answered him . " These prizes are ours ! " Something in the tone arrested Kit . The voice was a clear soprano , like that of a cathedral choirboy . He whirled , his eyes widening in his bronzed face , seeing as though through a faint haze the mouth as red as a blood rose , the emerald-green of the eyes , and the long sweep of the hibiscus-red hair . " You . " His mouth shaped the word , but no sound came out , no sound at all . Rouge walked toward him , her bare legs white under the boy 's trousers that reached but halfway between hip and knee . He could see the black lash of the Spanish whip that was coiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the young , upthrusting breasts which pushed their way half out of her tattered shirt . A sash of scarlet , exactly matching her hair , encircled the almost unbelievable slimness of her waist , and into it a brace of pistols was thrust . She approached him slowly , swaying lightly on her feet like a young willow in a spring breeze , and as she neared her green eyes widened in recognition . " Kit , " she whispered . " Kit of the golden mane ! And I thought that I had killed you ! " " No , " Kit exulted , " your aim was bad . I have searched the seas these many years in order to find you ! " He put out his arms and swept her toward him . At once her hands came up , dagger-taloned , reaching for his eyes . He caught them in midair and held them there , slow amusement curving the corners of his mouth . " Have you forgotten ? " she spat . " No man embraces me  --  not even you ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly , " I lay between life and death because of your shot . For that I shall exact payment  --  and now ! " But Rouge swung backward , wrenching herself from his grasp . She put up her slim white hand , which all the sun in the 87Caribbean had been able only to freckle a bit , and grasped the butt of the Spanish whip . Then she slipped down and out of its evil coil , playing it along the deck . " Come no closer , Kit , " she warned . Kit looked at her , seeing her young figure , lithe , soft-curving , revealed in all provocative purity of line by the abbreviated costume she wore , seeing her hair flaming about her shoulders , her eyes making green fire , her mouth scarlet , all the more inviting because of its fury . And , laughing aloud , he stepped toward her . Her crew lolled against the rail , grinning . This indeed was going to be a show . Kit took another step . The lash whistled through the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it away , the slow , thick ooze of blood followed it . Kit did not even glance down . He took another step and another , until Rouge was forced to retreat , the whistling crack of the whip sounding all the time , and the stripes on his arms and shoulders growing until they crisscrossed ; his fine linen shirt was a thing of bloody rags , and still he advanced upon her . Finally , in desperation , she swung the whip so that the lash curled across his face , leaving a bloody stripe from cheek to mouth . Kit raised a hand to his face . It came away wet with his own blood . Then , his blue eyes cold with fury , he sprang forward and caught her to him . His hand came up and caught her chin , forcing her face upward until he found her mouth . She struggled furiously in his embrace for a long moment , then her struggles lessened , ceased , her hands hung limply at her side so that the loop of the Spanish whip slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deck . Kit kissed her slowly , lingeringly , moving his mouth upon hers , pressing her backward until her lips broke against her teeth . When at last he released her she swung back against his arm , her eyes star emeralds behind the shifting haze of her tears . " You should not have done that ! " she cried . " You should not have shamed me so ! " Then , whirling , she ran to the rail and swung down the lines to the deck of her own vessel . Kit watched88her go , a crooked grin on his bronzed , bleeding face . Bernardo came up to him and touched his arm . " Those stripes , " he growled . " They want attention . Come , Kit . " Quietly Kit followed him . But before he quitted the Spanish vessel , he called one of Rouge 's crew to him . " Tell your Captain , " he said , " that I will discuss the terms of the division of the spoils with her  --  later . " Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face heavy with disapproval . " I suppose , " Bernardo growled , " that this ends our voyage . " " No , Bernardo , " Kit answered , laughing . " It means only that we do not go alone . " Bernardo paused in his sponging of Kit 's stripes and looked at his Captain gravely . " I know well , " he began , " that you will listen to nothing against her . But , Kit , she is not for you . When a man marries he should seek out a young maid , innocent and sweet of mind and body , pure in thought and deed , whom he can lead and instruct in the duties of wife and mother . " " And Rouge , of course , " Kit said dryly , " does not fit this description . " " Judge for yourself . Aside from the fact that she goes halfnaked , and has probably consorted with whatever member of her crew or ... " " Enough ! " Kit snarled . " I will not hear this even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fiend , the will of a shrew , and the morals of a she goat . " " Enough , I said ! " Kit roared . " Did you not hear me ? " Bernardo shrugged his enormous shoulders and fell silent , his deft fingers moving gently over Kit 's bruised and broken flesh . Through the heavy silence , broken only by the creaking of cording and tackle and the soft wash of the seas , came the noise of a new uproar . Kit could hear the high , clear tones of Rouge 's voice , but her words were muffled by the distance . No distance , however , could hide the pistol-shot sounds of her whiperacks . Kit bounded to his feet and raced toward the deck , with Bernardoat his heels. 89The two of them swung up to the lofty deck of the captured Spaniard , and running across it , peered down the other side , where the corvette lay . Rouge was walking on the foredeck , moving forward one step at the time , swinging the heavy Spanish whip while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cowed jackals . " Dogs and sons of dogs ! " she shrieked . " Knaves and whoresons , born of filth and abominations ! Have I not told you that I am not to be touched ? Must you be whipped to rags before you learn who is master here ? " Kit turned toward Bernardo , a slow smile lighting his blue eyes . " You spoke of her morals , " he said quietly . " In that perhaps I was mistaken , " Bernardo conceded . " But not in her temper . I would sooner mate with a fiend out of hell ! " " The matter of mating does not concern you at all , " Kit said with a grin . " Come , let us go to her assistance . " Groaning , Bernardo passed Kit a heavy pistol , and the two of them slid down a line to the low deck of the corvette . " Perhaps , " Kit said mockingly , " perhaps we can be of assist-ance ? " Rouge whirled , her eyes a hard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Have n't you done me enough harm ? " " I ? " Kit said . " I harmed you ? In what way ? " " I have taught these dogs , " Rouge said , " with good and sufficientexample , that no man lays a finger on me . Then you come and spoil it all with your pawing and mouthing ! Now they would like to follow your example , and I must whip them all , every man jack of them ! " " I see , " Kit said gravely , but with cool amusement crinkling the corners of his eye . " Perhaps I should allow you to shoot me again to convince them you do not lie ? " Rouge glared at him , her small face hot with rage . " Do n't tempt me ! " she said . " Nor shall I , " Kit said lightly . " I do not like being shot  --  or whipped . But enough of these incivilities . I came merely to extend an invitation to my fellow captain to dine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little of the anger left Rouge 's green eyes . " No , " she said shortly . " Why not ? Surely you are not afraid . I shall not harm you . " " You can not harm me , " Rouge said contemptuously . " But I can think of no good reason for dining with you  --  or with any other man . " " The division of spoils , " Kit said softly , " will give you excuse enough to offer your crew . As for yourself , I do not think you need any further excuse . Shall we say at eight , then ? " " At eight , " Rouge said . " Yes  --  at eight hours after you arrive in hell ! Off with you , Senor Cristobal . " Kit made her a mocking bow and turned away ; but as he placed his hands on the line , he turned once more toward the girl . " Before you come , " he said cheerfully , " do me the honor of bathing . I do not like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or sweat  --  it ruins their charm . Adios , Rouge . " He saw her hand reach down for her dagger , and despite his agility , the broad blade of the knife hissed past him so close that it sheared off a lock of his tawny mane . He bent down and picked up the lock . Then he crossed to where the dagger still quivered in an oak beam . Before her astonished eyes , he quietly wrapped the bright gold of the hair around the hilt of the dagger . Then he hurled the dagger back so that it stood in the mast above her head . " Keep it , " he said , " as a tender remembrance of me  --  to be pressed to your bosom of nights ! " Then he went up the line hand over hand , leaving her trembling with fury . " She 'll not come , " Bernardo said . " No ? On that score I 'll wager you a hundred ecus . " " Done ! " Bernardo growled . Kit went to his cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was as fine as any prince , ablaze with jewels , bedeckedwith yards of snowy lace and fine embroidery . Bernardo held up the mirror of polished silver before him , remarking as he did so : " Of three things there is no end : the cawing of the raven , the braying of the ass , and the vanity of a man in love . " By the end of the seventeenth century , masculine foppery9 1had reached an extent that was never again to be equaled in Western history . Five years Iater the reaction against its extremes had set in , but in April 1694 it still took Kit two and a half hours to dress himself adequately . So it was that when he again mounted the Sea flower 's deck he had a scant half-hour 's wait before the time he had set for the dinner . Actually , his wait was shorter . Fifteen minutes later he felt Bernardo tapping his arm and , looking up , saw the leather bag of coins dangling from that worthy 's hand . " You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , take your loot ! " Grinning , Kit pocketed the wager and walked eagerly toward the rail , over which Rouge 's crew was laying a plank . He saw them help her up , then the significance of all this ceremony came to him . Rouge was clad in a gown of exquisite Cordoba lace like a mist of midnight , cut in extreme decollete , its somber hue chosen deliberately to accentuate her natural fairness , so that above its black filigree work made in the pattern of strange , unearthly flowers the whiteness of her neck and shoulders and bosom was like a cry in the darkness of a man 's heart . The dress was caught about her waist and clung like the clasp of a lover ; at one and the same time it shielded and flaunted the proud upflare of her full , young breasts ; from her waist it arched down like the inverted bell of a black orchid plucked in a dream garden in a season of fevers and delirium . On her head the great masses of her hair were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his fingers and warm them at that living flame . He put up his hand and helped her down . Then he stood a moment , looking into her face . He took a stride toward her , swift and purposeful , but he halted abruptly without taking another . It was her eyes that had stopped him . They were as clear as sea water , but a light of pure mockery danced in their depths with a glee that was almost diabolical . Do what you will , they challenged him , I can match and top every move you make , " I changed my attire , " Rouge said tartly , " not to please you , but so that we would waste no time in banter . I can masquerade as a woman still , though the woman I was died long ago . " 92Kit took her arm and guided her toward his cabin . " I doubt that , " he said , " for if you are not alive , nothing on earth is . " " I live for one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm , curiously controlled , " and that is to see Luis del Toro , grandee of Spain , dead in his blood at my feet . " Kit poured out two goblets of wine from a stone flagon that had been cooling since morning . " I share that feeling , " he growled , " perhaps with better excuse than you . " He lifted the knife and carved slices off the breast of a smoked fowl . " Perhaps it was only a small deed , " Rouge said slowly , " as men count deeds . Only a bit of sport . . . . And what difference does it make if it cost my sister her life ? Or that I was to be married in another month ? I  --  who now must remain forever unwed . " " I do n't agree , " Kit growled . " Was your suitor so poor a man as to reject you for a fault in no way your own ? " " No , but I too have my pride . I could not come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green eyes were very clear . " To him , " she added , " or to any other man . " " I see , " Kit said quietly . Rouge lifted the goblet of ruby-colored wine . The dying sunlightcame through it and touched her long , graceful fingers with deep rose . " You said , " she mused , " that you share my feeling about Del Toro . Why so , Kit ? " " My mother , " he said , his voice husky , " died of torture  --  at his command . " Rouge drew in her breath sharply , her eyes widening until they dominated her entire face with their emerald blaze . When she spoke , her voice had dropped to a whisper . " I 'm glad I did not kill you , " she said . " And I too , " Kit said , smiling . " Dead , I could do nothing for you . Alive , perhaps I can lead you back to happiness . " " I shall never be happy again , " Rouge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kit said . " On the sea , surrounded on every side by rude men who know how to sink a vessel , cut a throat , and force a maid , but nothing else  --  perhaps not . But in93a home of your own with a man who loves you as your husband ... " " You ? " Rouge snapped . " Yes , " Kit said softly , " I. " Rouge stared at him a moment , her green eyes filled with soft lights that moved in unbroken progression as her gaze followed the clean , sculptured outlines of his face . " You love me , I suppose ? " she mocked . " How can you ? You 're a man , and men know nothing of love . Lust , yes  --  the satisfying of their grosser desires , but love . . . " She threw back her head and her laughter came out hard and mirthless . " Marry you ? And when I have grown old and fat have you looking in the village for some younger maid ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , " would you be so anxious to take me as a wife if I insisted on separate rooms and no intimacies between us ? Would you marry me for the pleasure of my company merely , for the music of my sweet voice ? Would you ? " Kit 's gaze dropped and his whole face was a picture of woe . Rouge 's laughter rang merrily through the tiny cabin . Then abruptly she halted . She leaned forward across the table , and her finger tips traced lightly the lash stripe on Kit 's face . " I have hurt you , " she said , " in more ways than one . And I am sorry , for in some ways you seem different from the rest . " She stood up , as if to go . Kit got swiftly to his feet and came around the table . He stood looking at her for a long moment , then , very gently , he drew her into his arms . As light as his touch was , he could feel her body stiffening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside from his kiss . He released her at once and , bringing both his hands up , cradled the soft oval of her face between them , looking quietly into her eyes . " You can not go on forever evading life , " he said , " or including me among those who have no other thought beyond their own gratification . You were made for me , Rouge  --  not for a day only , but as the partner of my soul . I must break through the wall you have built around your heart , so that you live again  --  warmly , as a woman should . " He bent down then and found her mouth . It was warm and sweet , but with nothing of response there  --  nothing at all . There94was something maddening in her coolness . His hands swept downward and encircled her waist , drawing her to him in a grip that was likely to crush her wholly , and his lips flamed upon hers , moving , searching , until slowly , softly , he felt the trembling start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surf-pounding surges , her face slanting itself now across his at a sharper angle , so that her mouth fitted more and more closely into the contours of his own , her hands creeping up , moving slowly , caressing the surface of his sleeves until at last they met and locked behind his head , her fingers working through the heavy masses of his hair . He could feel her lips slackening and parting . Then they were suddenly scalding , fiercely demanding , upon his own . Without freeing himself from her embrace , he dropped one arm to the level of her knees and , lifting her off her feet , laid her gently on the bunk . " No , " she whispered , her voice low and intense . " You must not !  --  But he sank down beside her and stopped her protests with his mouth until she lay trembling in his embrace , her lips , softsighing , brushing against the hollow of his throat . He straightenedafter a time , and she lay there staring up at him , her eyes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she spoke , her voice was so low that he had to bend down to hear the words . " Loose me , " she whispered , and turned over face downward , so that all the buttons and laces of her back lay under his trembling hands ... . Afterward , when time came blurring once more into focus , she lay very still beside him in the darkness , and a single ray of moonlight stole in through the porthole and fell across her face . He looked down at her , seeing the big teardrops filtering through her dark lashes , more jeweled than any diamonds in the world . And suddenly he felt curiously ashamed and unclean , as though his act differed not even in degree from the brutality of Del Toro . " Forgive me , " he whispered . " I never intended that you should be hurt because of this . Between us two there can be no thought of sins and sinning , for always it was meant to be thus . " There95was only silence from beside him except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he pleaded . " Say that you will sail with me to Saint-Domingue , and there we will be married . " Rouge sat up slowly , the tears streaking her face , then she swung the long singing curves of her legs outward and down , and gathering up her clothing , began to dress , still without uttering a word . Kit got up too and drew on his own clothing . When he had made some semblance of order among all his ribbons and laces , he turned once more to Rouge and drew her into his arms . She made no move to resist , but came quite woodenly , like one half-alive . He bent down and kissed her once more , his lips as light as a breath upon hers , as reverent as a prayer . She lay back against the circle of his embrace , her green eyes deep and somber , a little puzzled light moving in their depths . " I must have time , " she whispered . " Much time  --  in which to think . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fear which moved in her eyes and shook her voice was of herself , of her tremendous capacity for response to him , who , of all men on earth , had broken completely through her defenses . All her ideas were in need of revision . Passion , in spite of the Spaniards ' brutality toward her and her dead sister , existed in her after all . Her own blood , then , was as hot and eager as that of any panting animal of a man . . . . Yes , she must think ; she must have much time for thinking . " One year from today , " Kit said gravely , " I shall put into the harbor of Petit Goave . If you have changed your mind by then , join me there . Is that time enough ? " " Yes , " she whispered , " quite . " " Will you come ? " he whispered . She looked at him , a long , slow , searching look . " Who knows ? " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TORO sat alone in her room . Shewas as still as a statue of marble , and almost as pale . But for the green fire of the emeralds from Muzo and Chiquinquira , she seemed a masterwork by some priestly artist designed ultimately for the nave of a great cathedral . Only the occasional flutter of her snowy hands and the faint flare of her nostrils showed that she lived . But her young mind , alert to the point of rebelliousness , was far from inactive . Behind the dark screen of her eyes moved thoughts so daring that they frightened her . Just four years before , the Sister Juana Ines de la Cruz , sitting amid the shadows of the cloister into which masculine disapproval of her brilliance had forced her , had penned her immortal answer to the Bishop of Puebla , Fernandez de Santa Cruz , quietly defendinga woman 's right to have thoughts , and to express them , to cultivate the intellect that God had given her . And here and there throughout tropical New Spain an occasional woman had spoken out against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as their inalienable right . But Bianca , lacking the knowledge that she was not alone in her secret revolt , prayed to the Virgin to be delivered from the dark tumult of her thinking . If , she mused , I were not alone so much . If Luis would lessen his desire to devour the entire earth and take from it all its treasure , I might in time become accustomed to him . I might someday learn to care for him a little , for he is a man of great parts and even a little kindness . What more power can he want ? He is president of the Audencia , commander of His Majesty's97fleet in the western Caribbean . He owns three haciendas  --  why , in Spain his holdings would constitute an actual latifundium ; there are princes on the continent of Europe who possess less land . He owns mines at Cali , Muzo , and Zipaquira , and his petition before the King for the title of Count will surely be honored . He has indigo , bananas , and cane , three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lightest whim ; an encomendero over the services of another thousand Indians . What else is there in this world to gain ? .. . Her face darkened perceptibly as the answer to her question came unbidden to her mind . There is one thing more , which only you can give him  --  a son and heir . But he has sons , Bianca recalled . I 've heard him say . . . Mulattoesand mestizos , her reluctant mind taunted . Any Negress can give him a son , but only you can give him the noble Spanish son of his loins , the heir for whom he has built his empire . You alone can mother the straight-limbed , fair-skinned lad he dreams of , you alone can bring him the assurance that the proud name of Del Toro will not vanish .. . She remembered well the day she had first entered Cartagena with Don Luis . As they had driven down the cobblestoned streets of the city toward the Del Toro mansion , a painted woman , clad in a saya cut so low that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a halt . Bianca had stared at her . Never before had she seen a woman so shamelessly dressed in public . The woman had moved toward the carriage , calling to Don Luis with obvious familiarity . " Luis darling , what have you got now ? Diablo , but she 's a beauty ! Oh , but you 'll tire of her  --  the pale , pretty thing . Then you 'll come back to me . I 'll be waiting . " Bianca had turned a frozen face toward her betrothed . Don Luis nodded grimly to a hidalgo who rode alongside . The man spurred his mount forward , uncoiling a loaded whip as he rode . " Luis ! " the woman had squealed . " Stop him ! Stop him , for the love of God ! " Bianca had seen the whip rising against the sky . Then it sang downward , wrapping itself halfway around the woman 's body . When the rider drew it away , the cloth of the saya had been98cut through as cleanly as with a knife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's blood . Her scream had been a dreadful thing , high and thin and edged with terror . Again Don Luis had nodded . The hidalgo brought down the whip again , the loaded lash whistling through the air . Quietly , Don Luis put his head out of the window and addressed the coachman . " Drive on , " he had said . Now , recalling the incident , Bianca shuddered again . How can I give myself unconditionally to him ? she whispered to herself . His lightest touch freezes my blood , and his caresses bring only fear and trembling . I think that if a woman 's heart and mind are not opened to a man , her body will reject his seed . No , he must seek elsewhere for this son of his bosom ... . And you ? Will you also seek elsewhere for fulfillment  --  even across the Caribbees , to where he with the star-sapphire eyes and a mane of tawny gold roams ? Are you not really glad of your husband 's absence ? " Yes ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , I am glad , and I will think no more of this ! " She stood up suddenly and looked about her as though she were seeing the details of her room for the first time . Her eyes wandered over the great beams of quebracho wood  --  wood so heavy and strong that it sinks when tossed into the sea , so hard that it blunts the edge and shatters the handle of any ax used against it  --  down over the carved furniture with its gilt and brightly colored leatherwork to the cool red tiles of the floor . Great vases of Indian pottery stood in the corners , silk tapestry ornamented the walls , and everywhere there shone the moonlight gleam of silver mirrors . Through the open arch , Bianca could see the silver dishes glowingsoftly on the immense table of red lapacho wood , which was as hard as quebracho and as lasting . The dishes caught the flickering light of the candles that gutted and flared in silver sconces. - Beside her now the girl Quita entered the room as silently as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver brazier , the ruddy fire of the charcoal lending a slow , smoldering glow to the somewhat barbaric beauty of her face. 99Bianca looked past the mestiza toward the fine swirling lines of the iron grillwork that barred her windows . And these , of all the handsomely wrought details of her surroundings , registered upon her consciousness . In spite of all the delicate artistry of swirling vine tendril and leaf shape into which the iron had been tortured , they were still  --  bars . Such bars , she told herself , were necessary for protection against thieves and other intruders . But , her mind mocked , it is against the " other intruders " that they are chiefly designed . Since our fathers insist upon giving us in marriage to men about whom we know nothing , and since our husbands insist upon their right to sire bastards upon every Negress or Chibcha maid who crosses their path , they must pay for these privileges with the endless fear that we may retaliate in their absence , and we must pay in our turn for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they call homes ... . She stopped short , once more appalled at her own thoughts . There was something unfeminine in such thinking . It is only , she told herself again , that I am alone so much . . . . And there is nothing , the dark whisper in her mind mocked , of which you are more glad . And this of the bars  --  if Kit were to appear tonight at an unbarred window , would you not help him up and clasp him to you ? Bianca halted her thoughts at last , her convent-trained mind aghast at the dark , unruly tumult in her blood . Don Luis never woke such wild confusion within her . With him , she was the gentle , submissive wife who knew her duty and did it , repugnant though it might be . Perhaps her repugnance was the reason why , after all this time , there was no child . She would have been glad to present him with the son he so ardently desired ; perhaps then there would have been peace between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood there silently , the fragrant tea steaming in the silver bowl she held in her hands . " No , not here , Quita , " Bianca said . " Outside in the patio . " She got up and walked through the dining room to the enclosedsquare garden floored with tile , where a multitude of tropical flowers perfumed the night . She took the tea from'coQuita 's hand and sat sipping it slowly , her eyes dark and brooding . " Senora , " Quita whispered . " Yes ? " Bianca said without turning her head . " Why are you unhappy ? " Quita said slowly , shaping the unaccustomedSpanish words clumsily . " You are so lovely  --  with a beauty like the moon and the stars and the night . Why do you sigh ? Why do I sometimes hear you weeping in your chamber ? " Bianca looked at the half-breed girl . " It  --  it grieves you , Quita ? " " Much . " " Why , Quita ? Why are you concerned for me ? " " Because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are kind and gentle and never have me beaten . So my heart is a stone within me at the sight of your grief . But why is it , senora ? You , who have so much ... " " I , who have everything , " Bianca whispered , half to herself , " save that without which all else is nothing . " Quita leaned close , her black eyes warm with sympathy . " There is perhaps a man ? " she murmured . " A cacique greater than the Senor Capitan Don Luis ? " Bianca jerked upright , the red wings of anger beating in her fair cheeks . " You are impertinent ! " she flared , but the anger died as quickly as it had come . The smooth , kindly face of the mestiza was soft with pity ; and , too , realism was replacing the early mysticism of her religious training in Bianca 's mind . It posed a baffling question : In what way am I different from this slave girl ? I have wealth , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enslaved , but am I free ? When she finds love , she will go to her man and love him with all her body 's passion , and it will be a clean thing , a fine thing , a thing far better than this  --  this bondage in which fate and custom hold me bound ... . Gently she put out her hand and laid it on Quita 's arm . I was hasty , " she said . " I have no lover , Quita . But there is a cacique , greater than all the caciques of earth , whom I love . And but for the fact that he did not want me , I would not behere now . " IOI " Then he is a fool ! " Quita said fiercely . " Or a man of honor , " Bianca said wryly , " which is , perhaps , only another way of saying the same thing . " " Yet he will come back to you , " Quita said firmly . i  --  will see to it ! " Bianca looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corners of her mouth . " And how , " she demanded , " do you propose to work this miracle ? " Quita 's slim hands disappeared within the folds of her saya , to reappear after a moment with a necklace of gold . " Here , " she whispered , " take it ! " Bianca stared at the necklace , which was made of gold wire drawn to the fineness almost of a human hair , and soldered together in a pattern so intricate as to defy the skill of the makers of the finest European lace . At its apex swung the figure of a woman , cast in heavy gold . The figure was nude , and all the attributes of femininity were vastly overemphasized , but for all its primitive heaviness of form , it was beautiful . Bianca 's black brows rose questioningly . " It is a tunja , " Quita explained . " I do not know her name , I am vastly ignorant of the lore of my people . But this I do know  --  she will aid you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny Chibcha Astarte , grossly sexual almost to the point of obscenity , then looked up at the state of the Virgin , standing serenely in her niche . With quick revulsion she started to put the little figurine away from her , but midway in the action she wavered , halted . There was a curious fascinationabout the little pagan goddess ; there was something fresh and free about her  --  a hint of open fields and blue skies and mountains veiled in rainbow mists like those encircling the Cauca Valley near Cali . And suddenly Bianca understood that whatever evil there was in the little goddess she herself had read into it with her European-trained mind , with its habitual deification of the asceticism it finds so hard to practice . The little Indian figurine would henceforth represent to her the fertility of the earth , the fruitfulness of fields , and a clean and joyous love , free of shame and dark doubts and questionings , wholly good . IO2 " Thank you , Quita , " she said . " I shall treasure it always . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is n't it ? " Quita laughed . " I am no Spaniard , " she said . " Gold is nothing to me . We get it from the Panches , who grub it up from the earth and sell it to us for blankets , pottery , and salt . And who knows but what they get the better bargain , since they obtain useful things for this yellow dirt ? " Bianca looked at the girl , dawning respect in her gaze . " You are wise , Quita , " she said , " very wise . " Quita opened her mouth to say something , but outside in the street they both heard the clatter of hoofs . Quita bent and picked up the silver bowl and fled silently to her own quarters . Bianca heard her husband 's heavy tread in the hallway . Swiftly she dropped the figurine down the front of her dress and , picking up a goose quill , dipped it into a bottle of ink that stood on a table at her side . She put out her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Don Luis entered the enclosed patio he found her busily engaged in writing . He stopped short , his dark face twisted into a scowl . " You can write ? " he asked . " I do not like that . And can you also read ? " " Yes , " Bianca said firmly . " Though this is but a poor greeting from a husband away so long . " Don Luis strode to her and took her gently into his arms . " Forgive me , Bianca , " he said . " Seeing you writing shocked me . A woman 's mind is too delicate to be troubled with such things , and there are many things set down in print not fit for feminine eyes to see . " " I read only my catechism and my prayer book , " Bianca said tartly . " Besides , I am no longer a girl  --  marriage , naturally , has robbed me of my innocence . " Don Luis threw back his head and laughed aloud . " A ready tongue , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most accomplishedwife in Cartagena . There is not another woman in all this region who can read print or scrawl her name . But , knowingyour goodness , I will not let it trouble me . Besides , I have news for you . Letters granting me a patent of nobility , carrying103with it the title of Count of the Realm , arrived from Spain today . " Bianca freed herself from his grasp and made him a deep curtsy . But Don Luis , who was not lacking in subtlety , detected in its very graveness a hint of mockery . " My lord , " she murmured . " You do not seem overjoyed , " he remarked dryly . " No , but I am pleased , " Bianca said , " for you . As for myself , what can a title add to my life ? " " Nothing , " Don Luis growled , " since you have perversely persisted in gloom since the day we were married . But do n't mistake me . I care little for the empty honor or for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presently fawnupon me . It is only that it carries with it a of ma orazgo that warms my heart . " grant Y " That means that the land . . . " Bianca began . " I can not recall  --  explain this thing , Luis . " " You know what it means . My holdings can never be sold ordivided , but must pass down in unbroken succession from eldest son to eldest son  --  forever . " " From eldest son . . . " Bianca whispered . " Yes , " Don Luis said quietly . " And in that you have failed me  --  but no more . Tomorrow we set sail for Lima . There are physicians there who will put an end to your barrenness . " " You took me to Cali , " Bianca mused , " because there the air was good . And so it was . I loved the Cauca Valley with all my heart . It was a paradise of light and color , and the air was like wine . I hated to leave Popayan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good did it do ? Or the valley of the Rio Atrato inChoco when we stopped there for some weeks on our way back ? " " I did n't want to take you to Atrato , " Don Luis growled . " You insisted upon going there . " " Yes , " Bianca sighed , " and I wish now I had not . Those Indians standing waist-high in the waters all day panning out your gold , with the hot sun beating down on them and the whips of your overseers continually biting into their flesh . . . How many of them died while we were there , Luis ? " I Oq " Enough ! " Don Luis spat. " 1'hey were beaten , " Bianca went on as though she had notheard his command , " for panning out the green gold . Your men made them throw it back , and whipped them for bringing it out of the water . Why must it be thrown back , Luis ? Is n't itlovely metal  --  much like silver ? " 1 " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides , ifleft long enough it ripens into true gold . But enough of these silly questions . You have work to do . We sail at full tide tomorrowfor Porto Bello . " Bianca bent her head in a gesture that was just a shadetoo submissive . " As you will , my lord , " she murmured , but in the doorway she turned and her black eyes lifted to her husband'sface . " What reason does my lord give to the oidores and the caballeros for this voyage ? It is best that I know , so thatI may be in accord with you if I am asked . " Don Luis looked at her keenly , a sardonic smile playingabout his bearded mouth . " What would you tell them if I didnot instruct you ? " he asked . " That I am barren and my lord would have me cured of it , " Bianca answered . Don Luis frowned . " Say rather that my godson RicardoGoldames , nephew of the Archbishop of Cartagena , has completed his studies for the doctorate at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must attend the ceremonies  --  bear the expense , as is befitting a godfather . And that , my pretty little wife , happens to be true . " He sighed . " The expenses willnot be light .... But off with you , there is much yet to be done . " Again Bianca made her husband a low curtsy , and sweptthrough the doorway to her bedchamber . The next day when the tide was at the full , the great ship Garza , which is by interpretation the Heron , moved silently down the Bay of Cartagena , heading southward toward the Boca Chica channel , which led out into the open sea . Bianca1 The metal was platinum . The Spanish , who did not know its value , threw it back to " ripen into gold . " The San Juan and Atrado rivers in Colombia still produce the world 's chief supply. io5sat on the high deck under an immense silk canopy that shielded her fair face from the sun , and watched the Getsemani section drop behind . The ship inched over to starboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fortress of Santa Cruz . Beyond it the land sank suddenly almost to the level of the sea , and lay flat and regular until the rounded hump of the Terra Bomba rose out of the ocean . It was nearly nightfall when they hailed the fortress of Boca Chica , almost a full day having been spent in passing through the treacherous lower reaches of the Bay of Cartagena . But once in the open sea , the Garza spread her wings and moved majestically over the face of the waters . Three days later she dropped anchor in the harbor of Nombre de Dios and restedthere for the night . The next day she sailed the short distance to Porto Bello . Bianco was most anxious to go ashore , for if there is any one thing true of the Caribbean , it is that its waters are never calm . Even upon bright , blue days the Garza had rolled and pitched with ponderous deliberation , the very slowness of the motion lending misery to the seasickness that it caused . As the great vessel nosed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port its name , Don Luis stood on the forecastle andswore softly . Bianca lifted a white face with greenish circles about her eyes toward her husband . " What ails you , Luis ? " she demanded . " It 's fairtime , " he growled . " We could not have chosen a worse season in which to arrive . " " Why ? " Bianca asked . " Look , " Don Luis said , and pointed . Even from that distance Bianca could see the throngs on thewharves . In front of the vast customhouse , the streets were black with humanity . " Did a fleet arrive at Cartagena during my absence ? " Don Luis asked . Bianca nodded . " Diablo ! " he swore . " Every thieving merchant from Lima to Mexico City is in Porto Bello tonight . Once they have news of the convoy 's arrival they descend on this place like a flock of-vultures. " io6 " Why do n't they come to Cartagena ? " Bianca said . " That is where the fleet first drops anchor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Besides , the Isthmus has its narrowest neck here , so the merchants from Lima and other cities on the Pacific coast find Porto Bello easiest to reach . If we can find a place to lay our heads tonight , we may thank the Holy Virgin for her kindness . " A few minutes later Don Luis had handed Bianca over the side to the young officer in command of the ship 's boat . Then he climbed down beside her . As they came in to the quays , the helmsman had to weave his way through the tightly packed mass of pirogues , hoys , and even rafts that blackened the water , lying so close to one another that it was impossible to glimpse the sea on which they rode . Ashore it was worse . Though she was flanked fore and aft by her husband and his retinue , Bianca was buffeted and shoved by the howling crowd of merchants . Tents had been set up in the main thoroughfare ; open-air stalls were everywhere , piled up with all kinds of cloths , laces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , notions , tools , oils , perfumes . And there were slaves . Before these last , Bianca halted , staring openmouthedat the slim Dahomey maidens whose glistening naked bodies looked as though they had been carved out of ebony . Nor was she the only one ; a crowd of men were clustered about the slave mart , and from their winks , gestures , and bawdy talk , Bianca soon gathered that it was the singing perfection of the black girls ' willow-slim bodies , the curve of hip and ebon thigh , the high , conical upthrust of breast , that was evoking the feverishbidding , rather than any work that the Negresses might be able to do . She turned a stricken face toward her husband . " I should have warned you , " Don Luis said grimly . " Come . " At the intersection they had to wait a full hour before there was any break in the parade of mule trains , come from over the Isthmus , laden to the limits of the beasts ' endurance with sugar , cacao , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pearls , gold , silver , copper , tin , salt , cochineal , and emeralds . Finally they made their way to a smoky hostel , where for a single night 's stay Don Luis was forced to pay a thousand pesos. 107Their meals , Bianca soon discovered , were to cost them twenty times the price of a much better meal in Cartagena , and when the food was brought she found it inedible . After supper Don Luis left her in the care of Quita , guarded by two stout menat-arms . Bianca lay talking to Quita , and then began a short prayer for her husband 's safe return . He had , she knew , gone to engage mules to transport them and their goods over the Isthmus to the Pacific side , where they would board another ship and sail southward to Lima . But midway through the prayer the face of Kit interposed itself , and all unbidden , her thoughts set sail upon dark voyages . . . . If , she mused , Luis were not to return  --  Holy gentle Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and send him word . . . . But no , this is wickedness . It is evil to think thus . I must not , I must not ... . It was at this moment that Don Luis returned . Overcome with contrition for her secret wickedness , Bianca sprang up and flung herself into his arms . A moment later she discovered her mistake . The smoldering fire in his dark eyes blazed fiercely in an instant . His great arms tightened about her until her breath was almost gone . " Leave us , " he growled over his shoulder to Quita . Bianca heard , with a kind of icy terror , the swift rustle of the girl 's departure . Then , slowly , with oddly mingled strength and gentleness , Don Luis laid her down on the great bed . Afterward , as he lay sleeping beside her in the darkness , Bianca sat upright and stared into the lightless void of night . This time it had been different ; this time her traitorous body had leaped with unbidden fire ; this time her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hot in the close little room , and her naked body was wet with perspiration , but upward from her heart the glacial chill of terror stole slowly until she was shivering in all that dense tropical heat like one half-frozen . " Good-by , my Kit , " she whispered . " Now and forever , goodby . " Then : " Holy Mother of God , blessed among women , grant me that it be a son . " 1 o89KIT SAT STIFFLY on the back of the great white stallion . In his early youth in Cadiz he had ridden frequently on the pack mules that formed the backbone of Spanish overland transportation . And not infrequently he had obtained from one hidalgo or another employment that meant his riding the blooded Andalusian horses of the peninsula . But years at sea do not help a man 's horsemanship , and Kit found that managing the spirited animal he had bought from a neighboring planter required more attention an it had formerly . He was aware , too , that Bernardo Diaz was watching him with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a fact that Kit found somewhat annoying . Kit tightenedhis already firm grip on the bridle and touched the white stallion 's side with the big Spanish spurs he wore . They were of silver , as were the great stirrups hammered from the soft metal into the shape of the toe of a jackboot . To the horse , however , the rowels of the silver spurs felt the same as those of any baser metal ; his rearing almost unseated Kit . Kit brought him down again , loosing about the beautiful animal 's head a volley of trilingual oaths . Bernardo grinned wickedly . " You should never leave the quarter-deck , Kit , " he said , chuckling . " With horses you display a most unpracticed hand . " " Enough , " Kit growled . " What brings you here ? I can see by the look of smug contentment on your homely face that you have news . " " Alas , " Bernardo said cheerfully , " I have always had an open109countenance . It is my greatest misfortune , Kit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and guile . " " Never mind the philosophy , " Kit said . " Get to the news . It must be important to part you from your gaming and wenching . " " A wench or two might cool the fever of your impatience , " Bernardo observed . " You were not cut out for monkhood , Kit . " " The news ! " Kit roared . " I have none , but I do have an invitation from His Excellency the Governor for you to dine with him on Monday next at his house at Leogane . " " The Sieur Ducasse invites me to dine with him ? How did that come about , Bernardo ? " " I have often ridden through his cane fields . Three times a week , to be exact . Near Leogane there 's a small pigeon who puts up enough resistance to the plucking to make it interesting  --  and the shortest route to her home lies through the Sieur Ducasse 's lands . " " Are you sure you did not waylay him with some tortuous scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grinning , " at your suspicious nature . What scheme could I have ? " " Who knows , my old one ? " Kit smiled at him . " You of course chanced to meet Ducasse ? " " Yes . And the Governor , who is of Huguenot parentage , can take a mass or leave it , though I think he likes the leaving better than the taking . Therefore neither the question of my birth nor the fact of my conversion concerned him in the least . We talked of ships and sailing . It was a good talk , Kit  --  the man knows the sea . " " So ? How came this invitation to dine ? " " I dropped , in passing , word that I had served aboard the Sea flower . The good Sieur was at once all ears , and asked if I knew you . Your fame has spread abroad , Kit . The Governor very probably would like to employ you in some service . " " I do n't like that , " Kit growled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Patience , Kit . For miles on end one rides through a sea of cane , tilled by blacks brought from Africa . His Excellency hinted that such a plantation was not beyond your attaining . II0Here in the New World great wealth is much easier earned than in the Old . If I were you , I would lend a most attentive ear to what Ducasse has to say . " " This has a pleasant sound , " Kit agreed , " still ... " " What harm can come of eating the man 's food and drinking his wine , since both are reputed to be excellent ? " " I stand persuaded , " Kit said . " You will of course also be present ? " " Of course . Now ride with me a bit while I inform you about His Excellency . Nothing is more pleasing to a man 's ear than knowledge of his previous doings  --  especially when they have been noteworthy . And Jean-Baptiste Ducasse is a great man , I assure you . He began his career as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once distinguished himself by helping to drive the Dutch out of the island of Goree . Then he took all the rest of the islands in the Cape Verde group . He made his first voyage to Saint-Domingue in 1680 . . . . Are you listening , Kit ? " " Attentively , " Kit said . " Go on . " There he displayed his intelligence by taking heed of what everybody in the Antilles knew , but what no dealer in black ivory had ever bothered to consider : the fact that to continue to bring in Coromantes , Fantis , Ashantis , and Dahomeans was not only foolhardy but suicidal . Those tribes of blacks fear neither a white skin , God , nor the devil , and wait only for the first dark night to begin cutting their masters ' throats . He came back loaded with Whydahs , Nagoes , Pawpaws , Congoes , and Angolans  --  all diligent , tractable slaves . And to prove that the man can think , he brought not one Ebo , the easiest of all blacks to obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ducasse made his fortune  --  never before or since has a shipload of Negroes commanded a higher price . " " You are oddly expert in these matters , " Kit mused . " Have you studied the blacks , Bernardo ? " " Yes , " Bernardo replied with a smile . " When you get to be a planter , you will need a manager . " " You were speaking , " Kit said slowly , " of Jean-Baptiste Ducasse . The selection of my plantation manager can wait . " III " So I was . My wits grow addled with age . With the money that he made , Ducasse outfitted himself as a privateer . Soon he had made such a name for himself that Louis XIV commissionedhim a lieutenant in the Royal Navy . By this time Pouancay was dead and Paul Tarin de Cussy had become Governor of Saint-Domingue . We were in these waters with Lazarus when the news of De Cussy 's elevation reached us , remember ? " Kit nodded patiently . " Ducasse was exceedingly busy . He attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of St. Kitts ; then he sailed back to France . When he returned he found that he was now governor , for De Cussy had fallen in the sack of Cap Francais in 1691 . Ducasse chased the British away from Guadeloupe . Then he settled down to rule , with such effectivenessthat Saint-Domingue has become a model colony  --  even the buccaneers obey him . There the matter rests until this day , except for the forays by Daviot and Laurens de Graff against Jamaica  --  also at His Excellency 's orders . All in all , a most excellent leader , in my opinion . " " Yes , " Kit mused , " he seems a real man . Have you any idea what he wants of me ? " " Something touching Jamaica . It would do no harm to find out . Out here the world is young , and there are not the old quarrels , old schemes , and old jealousies to contend with . If filibustering were the only way a man could gain sustenance in the Antilles , I would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the great hogsheads of rum will make all the gold of El Dorado paltry by comparison . It will not be amiss to gain the Sieur Ducasse 's favor . " Kit did not answer . He bent his bronzed face and stared fixedly at the white arch of the great stallion 's neck , feeling the rhythm of the horse 's motion . They rode on in deep silence . The sun burned blood-red into the Caribbean and the night crashed down without twilight or dusk between it and the dazzling day gold . The palms and the mountains and the thickets disappeared in the abrupt darkness , and the profligate heavens flung out their treasure of stars . I 12 , The horses moved on slow-clopping through a night like man 's destiny  --  filled with sound and motion , traveling unceasingly onward toward a goal whose outlines can not be discerned . Exter , Jean-Baptiste Ducasse 's residence at Leogane , was a pleasant mansion built of great cypress clapboards , and the Governor himself was a tall , heavy man whose immense brown wig , curling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a benevolent lion . He greeted Kit and Bernardo with bluff cordiality , and led them to the great dining salon . Glancing at the silver service , Kit saw at once that the table was laid for only three . This was strange . For what reason had the Governor thought it necessary to maintain such privacy ? His Excellency was not slow in getting to the point . Over the golden mound of the roast fov  --  , i he eyed Kit quizzically , the light of humor dancing in his small blue eyes . " The captain of the Sea flower , " he chuckled . " You are young for such a command , Monsieur Gerado . " " What do years matter ? " Kit answered . " It is the straightness of the aim and the strength of the arm on the tiller that make the difference . " Ducasse reached out a powerful hand and took up a glass . He raised it to his lips and held it there without tasting the amber wine while his eyes studied Kit above the rim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my office at Port de Paix a record of French ships lost to enemy action in these waters . I seem to recall a Cygne , a Gallant , and a Gloire sunk by one brigantine called the Sea flower . There were more , but those come most easily to mind at the moment . " Kit put his own glass down with deliberate slowness and his eyes were cool and grave . " Not while I commanded her , " he said flatly . " I have never fired on the fleur-de-lis . " " So ? " Ducasse said calmly . " If not , it is most strange for one who was born in Cadiz , in the realms of His Most Impotent , Bewitched Majesty , that royal idiot Charles II of Spain ! " Kit looked at Ducasse , and smile wrinkles played about the corners of his eyes . " Would you bait me , your Excellency ? " he113asked . " If so , you take the wrong track . My mother , it happens , was born in Normandy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet . His arm swept across the table , reaching for Kit 's hand . " There ! " he roared . " I knew you were no dog of a Spaniard ! I should have known it before  --  your French is better than mine . " . And if your Excellency 's records are complete , " Bernardo put in dryly , " they should show that the Sea flower has sent twenty-two Spanish ships to the bottom within the past three years . " " They do show that , " Ducasse said , and laughed . " That was what puzzled me . But no more of this . Now to business . You know that the town of Port Royal was ruined two years ago by an earthquake . " " Yes , " Kit growled , " we were in the harbor when it hap-pened . " " So ? You were supremely lucky to have escaped , then . " " We were , " Bernardo said , " but pray continue . You were speaking of Port Royal . " " Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my small way , have implemented the arm of the Almighty . I have sent Daviot and De Graff to slow the English work of reconstruction , but for all that they rebuild much too fast and too well . " He leaned forward confidentially . " Not that I fear their fortifications and batteries , but there is a slower thing that over the years can ruin us here . " He glanced past Kit and Bernardo and his eyes took on a dreaming look . " All the world will one day make a track over the waters to Saint-Domingue . The Cul-de-Sac and Cap Francais and the harbor at Port de Paix will be black with shipping come from Europe to buy our sugar and our rum . There is where our wealth lies ! Let the Spaniards grub gold out of the earth  --  still it will flow back to us . I do not fear the Englishman 's guns , but I do fear their sugar mills and their slaves . They must not compete with us here ; in this Saint-Domingue must reign supreme ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want me to take the Seaflowerout and raid them once again ? " " No ! I would have you join me in a full-scale expeditionagainst Jamaica . I shall have more than twenty ships , and from this blow the English will never recover . But I can use your youth , courage , and skill . What do you say , Captain Giradeaux ? " " I do n't know , " Kit mused . " I have no quarrel with the English . The only Englishman I have known well was a kindly man . Still , this inaction begins to pall on me . " Ducasse crossed to where Kit sat and took his ann . " Come , " he said , helping Kit up . They walked to the window , and Kit followed his finger pointing over the immense expanse of cane fields to the very foot of the mountains . " There is , " he said softly , " over against Petit Goave , arpent upon arpent of such rich land , as yet untilled . As governor of this colony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whomever I will  --  in reward , of course , for services justly performed . " " And if I refuse , " Kit said , " you might recall to a court the Sea f lower 's former misdeeds , and leave it up to me to present proof that I had no hand in them . " Ducasse looked at the lad , seeing him young , fair , and very spirited . " No , Christophe , " he said quietly . " Your choice is free . Accept or refuse as you will . " Kit frowned . He tugged thoughtfully at the golden spike of his beard . " When do you sail ? " he asked . " Next month . " The next month was June of the year 1694 . There were yet nine more months of waiting before Kit 's promise to Rouge was to be fulfilled . And there was little hope that she would appear before the time appointed . He had much to gain and nothing to lose . " The Sea flower will take her place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of June 22 , 1694 , Kit and Bernardo lay in a little copse of woods on the island of Jamaica , looking out on a great cane field . Behind them hid the crew of the Sea flower . " Look , Kit , " Bernardo was exulting , " you have no country . By birth you are a Spaniard , but Spain 's star is setting and you have killed too many dons to face the reckoning . Likewise , you are not French , for men reckon descent after the father , and no man , not even I , knows with any certainty who your father was . But now you have gained a country ! Ducasse loves you like a son . He could not be more joyful over the feat of saving Major Beauregard 's troops from that ambush if he had performed it himself . He will not forget how many times you have turned the tide of battle in his favor . As a planter of Saint-Domingue , who knows what greatness you might attain ? " " Who knows indeed ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits unhappily in my gullet . I have known but two people of English blood in all my life . One of them was a great sea captain and the other the woman I want for my wife . " " She will know nothing of this , and she would care less if she knew . What can it matter , since by this you gain the means to make her the greatest lady of Saint-Domingue ? " " Yes , " Kit growled , " as to that you have much logic , though small right . But right and logic were always at variance , is it not so , my old one ? " " Always , " Bernardo agreed . To their left the tall chimney of a sugar mill sent volumes of black smoke into the air . Kit paid scant attention to the mill . He was watching the young Englishman who was directing the116Negroes as they fed the stalks of cane into the great stone crushers . A team of mules drew the millstones around . Kit could see that their left eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their endless circling from making them dizzy . A humane people , the English , he reflected , and turned his attention back to the young man . He was , Kid had to admit , an uncommonly handsome youth . A shade too handsome in fact , Kit thought . The young man was shouting at his blacks and his clear tenor voice came over to Kit . It took Kit a moment to understand the meaning of the English words . Had it not been for Smithers ' insistence upon speaking English to him , Kit might have forgotten the tongue that Lazarus had taught him with such painstaking care . " ' Od 's bodikins ! " the young man swore . " You black beasts ! Get it in there  --  push it closer or I 'll have your bloody hides ! " " Yas , Marsa Reginald , " the black who was feeding the crushers groaned . " Doin ' best I kin . " Kit saw the young man rise in the saddle and bring his riding crop down , full across the Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stalks of cane a convulsive shove . The next moment Kit heard him scream . It was a terrible sound , like a loon nightmaddenedor like a parakeet loosing his insane , fiendish laughter . Looking closer , Kit could see that the Negro had caught his hand in the crusher . " Mother of God ! " he whispered . " Why does n't he stop the mules ? " But the young Englishman  --  was n't it " Reginald " the Negro had called him ?  --  sat there like one stupefied . The great millstonesdragged the black 's wrist and forearm and upper arm between them , so that the slave was pulled round and round the outer rim of the crushers and the cane juice came out red with his blood . " Idiot ! " the Englishman shrieked , suddenly completely beside himself with rage . " You 've ruined the entire batch ! Brutus ! Bring the ax ! " Kit and Bernardo watched in cold stupefaction while another Negro hurried off , to return after a moment with a broadbladedax . I17 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brutus , his black face the color of old ashes , swung the ax skyward . Kit saw it arching against the sky . Then it whistled downward to strike the imprisoned slave 's shoulder with a sound like no other sound on earth  --  except , perhaps , the sound of the poleax in the slaughter pens . The black man lay on the earth , his arm sheared off at the shoulder , and the great flood of his life pumped out until all the earth beneath him was muddied . No one made the slightest effort to aid him or to stop the bleeding . Grimly Kit turned to his buccaneers . " All right , men , " he said quietly , " burn the field ! " In a trice the flints snapped against the steel , and the buccaneersblew lustily on the smoldering tinder . One of them got a tiny yellow flame and stuck the tarred end of the huge torch into it . Instantly it flared , and all the buccaneers crowded around the man , lighting their torches from his . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jamaica that their land was exceedingly arid . They were able to grow cane only by irrigation , and even so many of the stalks that stood in the fields were brown and dry . To the north , beyond the mountains , torrents of rain fell ; but the Blue Mountains  --  as the Jamaicans so accurately called the range that separated the north from the south of the islands  --  effectively stopped all rainfallfrom reaching the southern shore . It was in the south that the flatlands lay , and the industrious English had made them grow . The cane about the margins of this field was so much tinder . The system of irrigation was crude and misapplied . So it was that when the Englishman looked up from his blood-ruined cane juice and his dead slave , he saw a wall of flame advancing upon him , and through it a horde of buccaneers , shrieking like fiends and firing their great muskets . He stood there open-mouthed until Bernardo was upon him . The Jew 's great arm swept up , and his open palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's face . The next moment the Englishman was rolling in the dust . The fierce buccaneers pulled him to his feet and began to bindI18his arms . He jerked his face around and his eyes fell on Kit , beplumed , beribboned , lace at throat and wrist , a slim Spanish sword dangling at his side . " Your name , " Kit demanded . " Reginald Parish , " the young Englishman spat . " And if I were not bound ... " Kit 's blue eyes searched his face ; they were as cold as ice . " Release him , " Kit said quietly . The buccaneers hesitated . " Isaid release him ! " Kit growled . The men hurried to obey . " I have no sword , " Parish said . " Give him your sword , Bernardo , " Kit said . " I would not deny even such a dog as this the chance of an honorable death . " " You 're a fool , Kit , " Bernardo said . " How do you know this fop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance it , " replied Kit , smiling . " On guard ! " Reginald Parish brought his sword up in a practiced flourish . The blades made blue lightning in meeting , the air was loud with the clang of steel even above the crackle of the flames . Parish pressed the attack so that Kit was forced to give ground , parrying the Englishman 's thrusts with negligent , deceptive ease . " Reginald ... " he mused aloud as he fought . " That name has a familiar ring . " He stretched forward suddenly , his right knee bending , his left leg straightening out until the lace at his knee swept the earth , and the Englishman 's sword swept upward from his hand . Kit straightened and put the point of his sword against the earth . " Recover your weapon , " he said coldly . " You 're twice a fool , " Bernardo muttered . " Run the bastard through ! " Reginald Parish picked up the sword and saluted Kit with it . Then he lunged forward , beginning a furious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tierce and his blade continued along his opponent 's sword , opening a cut above the man 's eye . " Have you had enough ? " Kit asked , lowering his weapon . Instead of answering , Parish lunged forward with all his might , so that Kit was forced to leap aside , parrying in seconde so late that the rounded bell guards of their weapons ' hilts119clanged together . Kit came up body to body , forcing his opponent'sarm upward while the ribbons of sweat and blood bedewed young Parish 's face . " Without honor , ah , Reginald ! " he mocked . " Now to make an end to this . " He started forward , his blade a moving blur , so that Reginald was forced to give ground , meeting Kit 's blade in quinte , in sixte , now in prime , his hand held up before his face , the blade angling downward across his breast while Kit laughed and beat him back . Then , in sudden riposte , Kit laid the point of his rapier against Parish 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reginald ! " he whispered . " Now I know ! It 's the name of the man Rouge was to wed ! " " Rouge ? " Parish panted . " I do not know that name . " " A maid , " Kit said , " with hair the color of flame and eyes of emerald . " " Jane ! " Parish croaked . " Lady Jane Golphin ! " Kit sheathed his sword . " Take back your life . I will not harm anyone once dear to her . " " Then it was you , " Parish cried , " who barbadoed her away ! " He sprang forward , the point of his rapier aimed straight for Kit 's heart , but the crash of Bernardo 's pistol echoed above the raging flames . Reginald loosened all over at once , becoming suddenly boneless , Bernardo 's rapier spinning from his hand . Kit stood there watching him fall slowly toward the earth , then he raised his blue eyes to Bernardo 's face . " Thank you , my old one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground coughing blood . " Rosalind , " he gurgled . " You will not harm her ? . . . Swear it . " " Rosalind ? " Kit said . " Who is she ? " " My wife , " Reginald gasped , but the word brought a rush of blood to his throat , so that he strangled from it , his face purpling . " I swear , " Kit said . Something like peace came into Parish 's eyes . He opened his mouth to say something , but whatever it was it was never voiced , for at that moment he died . " An ugly business , " Kit said . He looked out at his men , I20who were busily overturning the vats and prying loose the millstoneswith great staves . " The price of becoming a gentleman of Saint-Domingue runs high , " he mused . " He had scant claim upon Rouge , " Bernardo observed . Then : " I wonder where the manor house is ? " As if in answer to his question , the high cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later the woman came in sight . She was as naked as the day she was born , except for a few rags of clothing that clung to her arms and shoulders . Behind her as she ran pounded two buccaneers . Hope flared suddenly in the woman 's eyes . She sped straight toward Kit , forgetful of her nakedness . When she was close she hurled herself into his arms and lay against his iron-hard body , shivering and whimpering like a whipped child . Kit disengaged her grasp gently , and taking off his greatcoat , wrapped it about her . The buccaneers gathered about Kit and the woman , mutters running from man to man . Kit faced them , one hand about the woman , the other holding a freshly primed pistol that Bernardo had that moment given him . " I told you last night , " he said flatly , " that I would have no rape ! Whoever disobeys me dies ! Understand ? " The freebooters fell back , their faces black with scowls . Kit heard the woman gasp . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead Englishman . " I am sorry , my lady , " Kit said in his slow , accented English . " I would have spared his life , but he forced the issue . " Lady Rosalind Parish turned her heart-shaped face toward Kit , seeing the clean chiseled lines of his jaw , the thin falcon 's beak of a nose , the mouth firm beneath the white-gold mustache , and the great mane of his hair spilling down over his shoulders like a golden fleece . Kit looked at her , seeing her face small , lovely , fierce . There were no tears in her blue eyes , the trembling was gone from the corners of her rose-pink mouth , which was curving upward at the corners in a terrible kind of joy . " I 'm glad ! Now I 'm free ! " she said , her voice calm with a dreadful calmness . " How I hated him ! " I2IKit was puzzled , but said , " Lead me to the manor  --  if these dogs of mine have not yet burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " they have not  --  they were far too busy  --  with me . " Kit turned back toward Bernardo and commanded , " Bury the dead . " Then very gently he led Lady Rosalind away from the smoke and cinders of the burning cane field . She marched ahead of him . Only three buttons of his coat were fastened , so that her white legs gleamed softly in all their slender length each time she took a stride . Once inside the manor house she asked him to sit down while she went to the wine cupboard . She returned with a decanter and two large goblets . " To my freedom ! " she cried , and drained her glass . Kit sat there with his glass untouched , looking at her in amazement . The three fastened buttons of his greatcoat concealednothing of her , but she moved before him like a graceful doe , entirely without shame . She downed another glass , then a third , her blue eyes brightening , her gaze moving intently over his face . " Had n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosalind Parish threw back her head and laughed . " No , good Captain , " she said , laughing . " I have no shame ! Your sea dogs removed all need for it . Besides , it 's nice to be naked  --  so very cool . " " Your husband , " Kit said . " Why did you hate him ? " She put down her goblet with a crash . " Because he did n't love me ! Because he was always mooning over another woman , Jane Golphin , who was barbadoed during the earthquake ! Because he was a weakling and I needed a man ! " She leaned forward , her lips dew-petaled , warm and inviting . " Such a man as you  --  perhaps . . . " She stood up suddenly , her slim fingers toying with the topmost button . " If you had come yourself , instead of sending those evil-smelling rogues , I fear I would not have struggled . " She came slowly up to Kit and put her head against his chest . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You can continueyour raid  --  tomorrow . " 122Kit put his hands roughly on her shoulders and pushed her away from him . " This day your husband has been killed . I fear that the dog in the human race is not confined to the male alone . " She looked up at him , her smile sensual and excited . " Yes , I am evil ! " She laughed as she said it . " I am glad of it ! I have held it pent up too long . " She studied Kit 's frowning face . " Do not go ! " she whispered . " In my lifetime , " Kit growled , " I have sent many a soul to hell . But I have not sunk so low as to kill the husband and take my pleasure with the wife . Good day , madame ! " He bowed , and turning , marched through the doorway . And as he strode through the woods , he heard the high , hysterical titter of her laughter . Four days later , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back toward the sea . His men drove a hundred Negroes  --  all Eboes , selected by Bernardo  --  before them . The raid , as a raid , had been a success . Two hundred and fifty mills and plantations had been destroyed and more than thirteen hundred Negroes captured . But the attack designed to reduce Jamaica to the status of a French colony was an abysmal failure . The English had been wounded . They had not been defeated . The long line of buccaneers , their faces lost amid the great dark forests of their beards , filed downward toward the shore in ragged lines , driving the slaves . Behind them , above the royal crests of the palms , Kit could see the huge plumes of black smoke billowing in the still air . " Fifteen , " he counted silently , " sixteen , seventeen , eighteen , nineteen . . . " And every one of them the house a man had loved or the mill he had built or the cane field he had made to grow on the arid soil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smoking embers of their manors ? How many of their women had run shrieking into the thorn thickets and marshes , only to be pulled down by these goats and satyrs he had helped loose among them ? His fingers strayed down to the frayed sash of gold he had made from Don Luis 's Heron Banner . Now while he was loosing 123his fury on the innocent , Luis del Toro was taking his ease in his house at Cartagena . Beside him , no doubt , Bianca was sitting , fair Bianca whose beauty still moved with troublesome brightness through Kit 's memory . If , he mused , it were not for the chance that Rouge might yetjoin me at Petit Goave , I would scale those walls and strike him down ! No , more than that , there is the possibility of a still richer vengeance ! What worse could I do , before I send him into hell , than to bind him hand and foot to a pillar , with this banner stuffed in his mouth for a gag , and then take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends all suffering , but with the sight of her writhing in my arms , even in the grave his sleep would be troubled ... . They topped a rise and looked down at the surrounding country . Kit frowned , for there before them lay still another plantation , which somehow had escaped burning . Bernardo looked up at Kit with questioning eyes . Kit 's frown deepened , his hand came up and tugged at the golden spike of his beard . Then he looked about at his men . " Well , lads ? " he said . " God 's blood ! " Smithers said . " A few more blacks wo n't hurt none . The more the merrier ! " The others nodded assent . Kit sighed . From the first he had known what they would say . " Spare the manor , " he ordered . " I will drink the owner 's wine . And no ravishment  --  there will be bawds aplenty when we reach Saint-Domingue . " " If we do n't bust first , " said Smithers , grinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor , which increased with the imminence of their homeward voyage . At Kit 's signal they swept down on the cane fields . Kit and Bernardo made straight for the house . Long before they reached it the dry cane fields were a sea of flame , and the crash of the overturning vats and crushers resounded from the mill . They turned down a neat roadway flanked by rows of white-trunked palms , leading to the great white mansion in the center . They had brought with them five or six buccaneers , considering this number sufficient to overcome the scant resistance they expected. 124When they were a hundred yards from the manor , a dozen armed Negroes came out . Bernardo peered at them intently , gauging the shape of their heads , their bone structure , and the flare of their nostrils . " Whydahs , " he pronounced . " Have no fear , these blacks are not fighters . " " Fire a volley over their heads , " Kit commanded . The long buccaneering muskets leaped to the freebooters ' shoulders . The crash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke drifted up through the palms , Kit saw the timid blacks scrambling for safety . " Life is strange , " Bernardo philosophized . " Either a man buys fierce Dahomeans or Coromantes and gets no work , or he buys noes , or Whydahs and has no defense from aggression . " 1Kit did not answer . He was leaning forward , pinpoints of fire in his blue eyes . A woman had come out of the manor and was beating the blacks back to the fray with the flat of her sword . She used the weapon as though she had handled a blade all her life . Kit hung there a moment , staring . Wildly , wordlessly , he began to run toward her . Bernardo looked after him in astonishment . He lifted his eyes toward the woman , then he too broke into a gallop . Even from that distance he could see that her hair was as red as the flames that devoured the cane fields . Kit came running straight toward the trembling blacks . The muzzles of their muskets came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them sharply . " Hold ! " she commanded . Kit came up to her , his blue eyes searching her face . " Rouge , " he whispered , " my little Rouge . " " Lady Jane Golphin , you murderous dog ! " she said , her green eyes fixed upon his face . " Get away or . . . " Kit slowed , a smile playing about the corners of his mouth . " Or what , Rouge ? " he mocked . " What , my red-haired sea witch turned gentlewoman ? " " You are mistaken , " she said evenly , her red mouth moving , 1 The troops of Toussaint , Dessalines , and Christophe , a century later , were nearly all of Dahomean descent , as were their leaders. 125shaping the words , her skin white as the petals of water lilies beneath the amazing brush fire of her hair . " I know no Rouge . " " Then I will instruct you , Lady Jane . You are oddly expert with that sword of yours , and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still hungers to be kissed . " He moved toward her , but the point of the rapier came up and rested on his bare chest . " Come no farther , " she spat , " or I 'll kill you ! " Kit glanced down at the rapier making a small dent in his bronzed skin . Then slowly , deliberately , he moved forward . A drop of blood showed around the point . Then , as he lifted his foot to move forward again , she drew the sword back , and the next instant Kit held her in his arms . Tears spilled over her dark-gold lashes and penciled her fair cheeks . " I am weak , " she wept , " weak ! You should die ! " " Why , my little Rouge ? " Kit whispered . Her pale face lifted , and her eyes blazed with emerald fire . " For taking away all I had left of belief in the goodness of men ! For proving that you too are a murderer , when I was learning in my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , the tears in her eyes like diamonds . " You came here to a land that had never harmed you . You burned and ravished and destroyed . And when you found Reginald Parish , you killed him because I had once loved him ! You fool , he was married , and I had long ago become merely his friend and neighbor ! " Kit tried to interpose , but he could not stem the rush of Rouge 's words . " You killed poor , spineless Reginald , " Rouge continued , her voice rising , " and then you lay with his wife ! Forced her , she says , though I doubt that , for Rosalind has scant need of forcing ! " Kit stared at her , light dawning in his eyes . " She lied , " he said gravely . " On all counts , she lied . I did not slay Parish . I left Rosalind untouched . " " I will not listen to you ! " Rouge cried . " All men are dogs , and worse ! Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my forbearancewears thin . " Kit did not move back . Instead , his arms swept up and drew her to him , and his lips found her mouth . He could feel her I26body trembling through the rich fabric of her clothing , sense the terrible warfare within her : the fierce demanding surge of desire , the great swift , sweet lassitude of assent struggling with her rage , her hurt , her hate . His mouth moved on hers , feeling her lips slackening into surrender , the beat of her heart beneath the soft-cushioning globes of her breasts becoming a drum roll , swift-pounding against his own . He bent down and swept her into his arms , oblivious of the stares of the buccaneers . With one booted foot he kicked open the door and entered the cool gloom of the great mansion . " Which way ? " he said , his voice hoarse . Mutely , she motioned with her head . He shouldered open the second door , and paused for a moment before the large bed , canopied with netting against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her down upon it . " No , " she whispered , " not yet , Kit . Talk to me  --  say that you love me , that I am not another Rosalind whom you take because you can . " Kit murmured : " No , never that ! You are my love , my heart , my bride . " Her white hands came up and lay along the bronzed curve of his cheek . " I am through with fighting against you , " she whispered . " I came here to Jamaica to learn again to be a woman , that I might not be ill of grace when I came to you . The lesson went hard . Teach me , my Kit  --  teach me to be whole again . Kiss me  --  hold me  --  never let me go ! " Kit bent down and kissed her mouth . Her pale fingers stole upward and caressed the bright blaze of his hair . " Now , " she sighed , " I am ready . Do what you will . Perhaps this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lean , iron-hard fingers trembled on the fastenings of the gown . Then suddenly her hands caught at his wrists and she sat up , staring out of the window . " My fields ! " she said . Then she turned the great blaze of her slanted eyes on him . " You , " she whispered , her voice edged and harsh , " you did this too ! You ordered the burning ! " Kit swung about , seeing the great wall of flame riding before the wind , roaring down upon the manor . The house , he saw in an instant , was doomed . He half-turned back toward her , butI27the motion came too late . He saw the flash of the silver candelabra as she swung it with all her force . He jerked aside , but not fast enough or far enough . The blow that might have stoved in his skull merely glanced along the side of his head , leaving him swaying dizzily on his feet and shaking his head to clear his reeling sight . He heard the swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and staggered after her . She fled down a long hallway toward the rear of the house . Kit ran unsteadily after her , and came out into the courtyard in time to see her mount and ride away . He was still there , supporting himself by an arm about a pillar , when the others joined him . Bernardo looked at him with anxiety , but Smithers and the men , seeing the thick ooze of scarlet spreading down his face , roared with unconcealed joy . " No ravishment , eh , Captain ! A good rule , sir ! You should practice it sometime ! " Kit looked at them , and a wry grin spread under the blond mustache . " I am bested , " he admitted . " But for this , that redhairedsea witch shall pay ! " Then he turned and took Bernardo 's proffered arm . An hour later they started their final march to the sea . I2811Krr STOOD MOROSELY 011 the foredeck , watching the Sea flowerthread her way delicately between the whitecaps , pushing her prow into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had been running due west , almost at right angles to their true course , but now the gale whose fury had driven them some three hundred leagues out of their way was blowing itself out . In another hour , perhaps they would be able to set a new course for Saint-Domingue . His fingers stole up and touched the swath of bandages that encircled his aching head . I almost had you won that time , my little Rouge , but for a wind and flame and obedience to the orders governing an expedition I joined against my better judgment  --  which , in fact , I joined only to gain for you the station befitting you . Now I have gained these things only to lose you .... Lose her ? Lose Rouge ? Never while she lived ! Twice now she had lain trembling and lost within his arms , soft with the lassitudeof surrender . And the second time would have been the first repeated , made more glorious , but for the hellish mischance of that burning field . That first time on shipboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the last , to brand him hip and thigh with her beauty that was both snow and flame  --  with how bright a glow did the memory flare in his mind still ! To the end of his days that thought would warm him , no matter how cool his blood would grow with age . But what had been could be again  --  and this time for as long as they both should live . He had burned her house . Very well , he would build her another , and such a house as she could notI29now imagine in her wildest dreams . He had burned her fields . Now he would fling down at her feet fields bathed in sea mists , fragrant with rains , in which in the space of days the cane would spring up taller than a mounted horseman  --  fitting recompense for those dry , brown Jamaican fields that had to be watered at the cost of so much labor . He stopped short . He would do these things , but what then ? How was he to find one small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years had passed between the time he first saw Rouge standing drenched and trembling on the Sea flower 's deck and the time when by purest chance he had stumbled upon her attacking the great plate ships . How many weary years would pass again before he found her ? She would not go back to Jamaica , that he knew ; she would hurl her renewed fury down upon the heads of men  --  and he , God help him , must find a tiny craft that might be anywhere within three thousand wind-whipped leagues . He was interrupted in his reverie by the lookout 's shout , floating down through the diminishing shriek of the wind . " Vessel astern ! " he called . " Three points to sta'board ! " Kit and his officers crowded aft , staring at the apparition , their minds refusing to credit the evidence of their eyes . For there , on the crest of the still wildly racing waves , a ship rode with every sail bent to the wind , heeling over at so great an angle that her lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed no sailing vessel was ever intended to make . The vessel alternately appeared and disappeared as she drove through the walls of spray , and each time they saw her she was nearer . Now she was upon them , and Kit could see that she was a corvette with lines as clean and trim as the Sea f lower 's own . Then as she drew abeam a great roar burst from her single line of guns , and she disappeared momentarily behind the cloud of gun smoke . Instinctively , Kit hit the deck , and the balls sang over him by inches , smashing the gunwales into matchwood , and overturning four of the Seaf lower 's guns . " Gunners to station ! " Kit howled , and the Sea f lower became an anthill of frenzied activity . The passers and the powder monkeys skidded over the wet decks , their deadly burdens130cradled in their desperate arms . The gunners had trouble with their matches , but after several agony-laden minutes they got them burning despite the storm . The touchholes had to be cleared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were ready , the Seaf lower had taken another broadside that killed three of the men . Bernardo swung at Kit 's sleeve , pointing . Kit looked down at the glowing object that hissed on the wet deck . " Mother of God ! " he breathed . " They 're serving red-hot shot ! " Then he turned back to his gunners . " Hold your fire ! " he called . " Helmsman , run her in until we ca n't miss ! " Again the corvette loosed her murderous hail , but the men were better sheltered now . The Sea flower veered in toward the attacking vessel , riding in so close that Kit could see the name on her prow . " Seawitch , " he spelled out , his brow knitted with frowning . He lifted his sword high , holding it there while the gunners crouched beside their silent pieces , waiting for his signal . The Sea flower fell off a bit , running exactly parallel to the corvette , her guns at point-blank range aimed at the slim and deadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sword arm started downward . Halfway down he halted the movement abruptly , his breath a tangled burning within his lungs , for there on the high deck of the corvette the woman stood , her long red hair streaming to leeward like a banner of blood . " Hold ! " he got out , but the word was a mere croak . The wind snatched it from his lips , and before he could reshape it the titanic thunder of the Sea flower 's guns rocked sea and sky with their belly-deep roar . The walls of smoke rose before his eyes , and he heard his own voice shrieking like a man gone mad : " Hold ! Hold your fire for the love of God ! " Then the smoke cleared , and he saw the light corvette , never designed to match guns with so stout a vessel as the Sea f lower , heeling over as though mortally wounded . Even as he watched , he saw the fire break out amidships , and as he swayed there , his face gray as death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hot shot ! " Bernardo yelled . " Knocked it over , hand bellows and all , and the bastard 's burn-131 ing ! Give him another , Kit ! Finish him off ! God 's blood , did n't he know enough not to attack the Sea flower ? " " Ride her in , " Kit called . " Cease fire . Grappling irons ready ! Stand by to board her ! " Bernardo turned an incredulous face toward his captain . " You 're mad , Kit ? You ca n't board her in such a sea ! " Kit turned his face , gray-pale and haggard , to Bernardo . " It 's her ship , " he whispered . " And board her we must , though we drown in the attempt . " The Sea flower drew closer , her own crew watching the mountainous seas with fear-stricken eyes . From where they stood , Kit and Bernardo saw Rouge walking up and down the deck , swinging the long Spanish whip , the crack of the lash sounding even above the storm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the guns roared out one after another . At such a distance , it was impossible to miss . Kit kept his gaze fastened on the dying Seawitch , but as he watched , the Sea- flower veered suddenly , the distance between the two vessels widening . Kit turned to growl at the helmsman , then his jaw dropped blankly . Where the Sea flower 's dos d'ane had been there was only a smoking mass of timbers , the whipstaff itself was a thousand ragged splinters , and the brigantine was entirely out of control . He stood watching the blackening seas growing broader between the two vessels . The tarred stays , shrouds , hal- yards , and clews of the corvette were burning rapidly , the sails catching , too , despite their wetness . A great weakness stole up through his limbs . He sat down abruptly on the deck , watching the boiling masses of mist and cloud blotting out the Seawitch 's outline . For a long time he could mark her by the bloody glow that she cast upward on the enveloping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and death . He sat very still on the Sea flower 's deck , without moving , until Bernardo touched his arm and led him away . Bernardo knew it was not well for the Sea flower 's crew to see her captain weep . In the morning the sun broke through the high , fleecy mare's-tails and all the sea to the east was a rosy pink , breaking 132 in gentle swells so mild that the brigantine scarcely rolled at all . On the deck the ship 's carpenter and a crew of hands sweated and swore as they fitted a new whipstaff into place . Kit trod the deck forward and aft , his blue eyes blank and unseeing , his thin mouth held in a tight line , his fingers clenchingand unclenching . He stopped before the laboring group . " How long now ? " he demanded . The ship 's carpenter looked up and wiped the sweat away from his brow with a grimy hand . " God knows , Cap'n , " he said . " Another four-five hours . " " Mother of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantlyat his side , put out a restraining hand . " It 's no use , Kit , " he said kindly . " By now that corvette has gone down with all hands . It was vile luck , but you must not blame yourself . " " Not blame myself ! " Kit exploded . " Whose fault was it , then ? Had I not seen that vessel before ? Had I not set foot on her deck ? And the name  --  how often have we both applied it to Rouge herself ? That little sea witch  --  that little red-haired sea witch ! If I were not a prince of asses , she might be here nowaliveand with me . Holy Mother of God ! What have I done to deserve this ? " " Gently , Kit , gently . In this life there is much that a man can never understand . You are young , and all of life is before you . Time heals all wounds , and ... " " Enough of your ancient saws ! There is nothing left in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on my hands . " " She tried to kill you often enough , " Bernardo remarked . " Would to God she had succeeded ! Better that than this ! " Bernardo shrugged and turned away . Then , after three longstrides , he stopped short , perched on one leg like a grotesquewaterfowl . " Kit , " he whispered . " Be quiet ! " " No , Kit , this you must see ! " He pointed , and Kit , raising his head , saw what it was that had stopped Bernardo . There on the horizon lay four bright sails . Kit stared at them fixedly , watching them grow larger. 133 " Ducasse 's squadron ? " Bernardo ventured . Kit shook his head . " No , " he said . " I fear they are English , from their cut . Order more men to help the carpenter . " For two hours more a beehive of men sweated and fumbled and swore , trying to complete the repairs , while the sails of the four vessels grew ever larger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast English frigates , bristling with guns . While the stubborn timber resisted all efforts to fit it into the badly bent socket of the former whipstaff , the first of the English vessels drew close enough to open fire with her chase guns . " Gunners to their stations , " Kit ordered quietly . His voice was a husky whisper , flat and calm , drained of all feeling . The men scurried to their places , but at the moment only the guns beneath the stern castle could be brought to bear . Kit watched the Englishmen 's roundshot tearing through his rigging with to expressionless face . If , his whole bearing seemed to say , this be doom , then I am ready ... . But Bernardo turned a face dark with fury upon him . " You have no right to do this , " he said coldly . " We can not maneuver , while they can . They outgun us four to one . They can beat in and pound us to pieces ! " Kit shrugged eloquently . " If you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least consider the men ! " Kit studied the face of his friend , his own eyes cool and grave . " I think they would prefer to die as seamen should , " he said , " rather than to hang on the end of a yardarm . " " Stop , Kit , " Bernardo said , " the English are not wanting in honor . Do we not bear letters of marque from both His Excellencyand the King ? As the crew of a commissioned privateer , all they can do is hold us prisoners of war until this conflict ends . " " But will they honor these letters ? " Kit asked mildly . " The Sea f lower is well known in all these waters . " " We have never taken an English prize , " Bernardo reminded him . " We have preyed chiefly upon the Spanish , with some minor forays among the Dutch . I think they will treat us well . " Kit gazed toward the fat mushroom of smoke that ballooned out of the mouth of one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball as it passed overhead . " Very well , Bernardo , " he said quietly , " you may order134Smithers to strike our colors . " Then , turning on his heel , he marched below . The English vessels moved alongside and slung over their grappling hooks . Then their boarding parties came over the side , to find the Seaf lower 's crew drawn up ready to receive them . Kit had returned to the deck . " So , " the young English captain said , smiling , " this is the celebrated Sea flower ! I had expected a hotter reception , Captain Gerado . " Kit made a slight bow . " We were disabled , " he said shortly , " in a chance encounter with one of your vessels yesterday . I wished to spare my crew needless bloodshed . " " So , " a cold , sneering voice spoke up from the English captain'selbow , " you deliver them up to be hanged ! " Kit turned and looked at the Spanish officer who stood there in breastplate and helmet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hanging , Don Enrique ? " the English captain demanded . " Is it not the fate commonly dealt out to pirates ? " the Spaniard countered . " The court at Port Royal will have that to decide , " the Englishmansaid coldly . Kit smiled . " I trust that the good Captain ... " " Neilson . " " That Captain Neilson will be so good as to remind the courtthat the Sea flower has never taken an English prize . " " But what of Spanish vessels ? " Don Enrique demanded . " What of England 's ally and true friend ? " " I have had the pleasure , " Kit mocked , " to send to hell above a hundred of the vessels of that monarchy which lacks both wit and honor . I think that Their Majesties of England will one day thank me for a signal service , once their eyes have been opened to the tragedy of this mesalliance . " Don Enrique sprang forward and struck Kit full across the mouth with his open palm . Kit smiled softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid England of one more false friend , " he said quietly . " No , " Neilson growled . " Enough of this farce . Captain135Gerado , you will be good enough to accompany me to my vessel , the Glorious . You may bring with you such of your officers as you designate . " Kit nodded to Bernardo and Smithers . An hour later , they sat with Captain Neilson in his own cabin drinking his good wine . " I will do what I can , " Neilson said . " I like this alliance as little as you do . The letters will be presented in evidence . I think they will do some good . " Four days later the crew of the Sea flower stood before the King 's magistrate at Port Royal , listening to a fierce denunciation by the royal prosecutor . " These men have shed English blood ! " he roared . " They have burned plantations and ravished Englishwomen ! If your lordship is so disposed , I would call in evidence Lady Parish who suffereddishonor at the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned to their defense made a perfunctory gesture of protest . It was quickly overruled . There was a rustle of skirts and the whole court rose as Rosalind Parish was led to the witness box . She raised her hand and took the oath in a quavering , tear-laden voice . The court was hushed and silent . " And now , my fair lady , " the Crown prosecutor began , his voice sinking to a low rumble that he evidently intended to sound benign , " the court wishes to spare you as much embarrassmentas possible . If you will answer my questions as simply as you can , I think we can word the matter so as not to offend your  --  ahem  --  delicate sensibilities . " " Object ! " the defense squeaked . " Overruled , " the magistrate boomed . " Do you , my dear lady , " the prosecutor began , " recognize this man ? " Rosalind 's blue eyes lifted and met Kit 's cool stare . " I  --  I do , " she whispered . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " the prosecutor thundered . Again that quick nod . Kit smiled grimly . " And  --  ahem  --  afterward did he not force his way into your 136bedchamber  --  and hah  --  ahem  --  force you to submit to  --  ah  --  certainindignities  --  at  --  ahem  --  pistol point ? " Kit looked at Rosalind and threw back his head and laughed aloud . A furious buzz ran through the courtroom . The magistrate thundered with his gavel . Rosalind 's face was scarlet , her blue eyes alight with anger . " He did ! " she said in a high , clear voice . " And afterward he turned me over to his crew ! " The whole court became bedlam . The magistrate pounded his gavel in vain . It was long minutes before order was restored . " Captain Gerado , " the magistrate boomed , " what have you to say to these charges ? " Kit stood up with almost insolent deliberation . " I am not so ungallant , " he smiled , " as to contradict a  --  lady . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I might say that my crew and I were here in open warfare , at the orders of the King of France . The letters of marque submitted bear that out . I say that this court has not established our guilt upon the charge for which we were brought to trial , that of piracy against the Crown . Since we have not been charged with violation of the articles of warfare , it seems strange that we should be tried for it . As for our having violated the honor of Madame Parish , I dare say that half the young blades of Port Royal have personal knowledge that such a feat is beyond possibility  --  since one can not destroy what does not exist . " Again the thunderous uproar . The head of the gavel broke away from the shaft under the magistrate 's furious pounding . As the room quieted , Kit could seen Don Enrique standing with his right leg forward , his head bent in a half-bow in the magistrate 's direction . At once the magistrate recognized him . " Don Enrique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Majesty 's Government could but regard it as an unfriendly act if these men receive less than the extreme penalty , " the Spaniard said smoothly . The magistrate waved a hand airily , as though to dismiss all thought of that remote possibility . Kit watched Rosalind 's face as the magistrate rose . It was chalk-white and her eyes were13712seeking his . He gazed at her coolly , ignoring the agonized pleadingin their depths . " The prisoners will rise and face the bar , " the bailiff intoned . The Sea flower 's crew rose in a ragged semicircle . " In view of your high crimes and misdemeanors against Their Majesties ' Government and against that of our royal ally , Charles II of Spain , I hereby sentence you to be taken from the gaol at dawn tomorrow , paraded through the streets for the edificationof the populace , and finally hanged by your necks until you are dead . And may God have mercy on your souls ! " The silence had thickness and texture . It could be felt . Every man in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daring to be the first to let it out . So it was that Rosalind 's explosive gurgle had all the carrying power of a musket shot . Every eye in the court swung in her direction . She stood up , swaying a moment , before she crumpled in a dead faint at the foot of the bar . Silence then  --  heavy as death . Then the uproar , complete and terrible . AFTERWARD BIANCA preferred not to think of that journey across the Isthmus by mule train . Here was country the like of which she had never seen before  --  steaming jungle through which a path had to be hacked with brush hook and machete ; fetid swamplands alive with mosquitoes , filling her delicate nostrils with their ugly marsh stench ; monkeys and harsh-voiced parrots howling overhead ; fer-de-lance and venomous bushwhacker slithering their deadly , twisting bodies through the undergrowth . To make matters worse , her miserable morning sickness brought her daily proof that she was indeed with child , and the jolting of the mule did nothing to add to her comfort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bore his chafing with silent dignity . Finally , however , her condition had become so bad that Don Luis was forced to use a litter for her , which was suspended between two mules . After that the journey was easier . They came down to the Pacific side , passing the blackened ruins of the old city of Panama , which stood in silent rebuke to Henry Morgan 's infamy . Bianca turned away , and the weary mules clopped the last league of their journey into the small but bustling hamlet that was growing into the new Panama . When Bianca sat up in her litter and saw the great ship that was awaiting them on the blue waters of the Gulf of Panama , she wept from sheer joy . Once aboard ship , she recovered her health with the boundlesselasticity of youth . By now , her morning sickness had passed , and she felt so well that she was a little ashamed of her high spirits , having been taught that delicacy , especially during pregnancy , was the hallmark of the patrician. 138 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring . Here , off the northwestern coast of the vast Viceroyalty of Peru lying along the rugged Pacific shores , the sea was of a blueness that stunned the imagination , rolling majesticallyinland in waves like long folds of lapis lazuli until it reached the shoal waters . There , as clearly and as sharply as though the line of demarcation had been drawn by the hand of a giant , it blazed pale-green , as bright as emerald . On the shore , in the declivities between the mountains , thick forests of palms and thickets of bamboo tossed their bluish-jade crowns against the azure sky . Birds like feathered jewels , crimsonand maize-yellow and topaz , exploded their rainbow brillianceagainst the somber trees . They sang and screeched and arched their bright trajectories between sun wash and tree shadow until , watching them , Bianca wept . Don Luis laid his arm gently across her shoulders and drew her to him . He looked down at the small face from which all color had drained , leaving it like Andean snow except for the almost savage scarlet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroked the hair  --  black almost to the extent of suggesting blueness , so that in its sheen no hint of brown or red showed  --  that fell like starless night shadow about her shoulders . He felt again the momentary start of surprise that this foaming cascade of blue midnight was so warm to the touch ; his eyes registered for the thousandth time the startling juxtaposition of ebony and spring snow , so that when he spoke the boom of his great bass had an underlying hint of pain in it . " Are you thinking of another bird of fine plumage , Bianca ? " he said . The quick black eyes lifted to his suddenly and their gaze rested cool and grave upon his face . " All that  --  is past , " Bianca said , her voice utterly wanting in expression . Don Luis frowned . The little nagging whisper that had lain buried since the day he had retrieved his captive bride from the cove of Cul-de-Sac probed its ugly way to the surface of his consciousness . " Is it ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " 140The dark eyes darkened even more , becoming night-black . Bianca searched her husband 's face , and the corners of her mouth stole upward in the merest ghost of a smile , but she did not answer . She stared at him coolly , gravely , quietly , until the great veins of his temples stood out and beat with his blood . " Answer me ! " he thundered . " Have you forgotten him , Bianca ; forgotten this nameless bastard of a worthless Frenchwoman ? " " At any event , " Bianca said quietly , " you have not , my lord . " Don Luis glared down at her , his face dark with anger above the jutting night cloud of his beard . " I am not sure , " he said evenly , slowly , spacing his words with the menacing deliberation of a man accustomed to control all things , even his rages , " that I have heard a convincing account of what happened in Hispaniola while you were  --  detained . " " Did n't you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangled jungleland of the shore . Don Luis stared at her , lovely and defiant , the green bile of tortured jealousy boiling inches below the level of his throat . His hands shot out and spun her around , none too gently . " Speak ! " he roared . " What happened there ? " " Your voice is overloud , " Bianca said with exasperating sweetness . " Would you share our tete-a-tete with the crew ? " " Enough of your raillery ! " Don Luis said , but his voice was lower . " I think an answer on that score is due me . " " Why ? " Bianca asked innocently . " Because . . . " Don Luis began . Then he realized the trap into which he had fallen . It was impossible to maintain dignity and at the same time admit his jealousy . " It is enough that I await an answer and command that you give it , " he said . " And if I refuse ? " " To refuse , " Don Luis said heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I  --  perhaps  --  took a dishonored woman for my wife . " Bianca paled , her eyes black fire coals in the whiteness of her face . " Has it ever occurred to you , " she whispered , " that such a supposition is a most vile insult ? " " That I do not know , " Don Luis blustered . " I know only that he is young and fair to look upon , and that you are young and141susceptible . " He paused , searching her pale face , and the rage died within him , leaving only the sickness and the hurt . " Say again that nothing happened there , " he whispered , " and I will believe you . " Bianca studied this great , strange man who had become her husband , who would sire whatever children she would have , and the intimacy of both these reflections did not detract from his strangeness . He might have been a graven image for all the warmth that kindled in her eyes . She could answer him , she knew . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened between her and Kit  --  nothing , save only a kiss . So her thoughts ran . But Bianca was not lacking in that strange quirk of utterly feminine cruelty which is so much a part of every woman . " Think what you will , my lord , " she said at last . " I will not deny you the solace of your thoughts . " Then , very deliberately , she turned away from him . Don Luis took a half-step toward her , but his dark eyes fell on a little group of harquebusiers who had stood staring curiously at him and Bianca . He stopped short and turned his furious countenance toward the slowly backward-slipping land . The ship butted her way southward across the equator , and suddenly all the warmth was drained from the air . Bianca stood on the deck with a shawl about her shoulders and watched the steaming tropical forest disappear to the northward while directlyabeam of the vessel lay scrub trees , dwarfed by the chill . She was conscious of her husband 's dark , tormented gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under the prow of the ship the water was icy-green , and the bleak , forbidding , bone-dry land stretched southward in austere beauty as far as Bianca 's eye could see . She gazed at the gray skies lowering above land that might have been the Sahara for all the moisture it contained . Then she turned puzzled eyes upon her husband . " So many clouds , " she mused , " and yet there is nothing here but sand and rock . Why is that , Luis ? " Don Luis spoke up quickly , almost jovially , delighted that142Bianca had at last broken the strained silence between them . " It has not rained in Peru , " he said , " for seven years . Often , it is said , babies have grown to manhood in these parts without seeing rain . Yet in this season the clouds are always there . God and Virgin alone know why no rain falls from them . " " Then , " Bianca queried , " how do the people live ? " Don Luis put out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lower foothills of the coast ? In the season of clouds , a mist but little heavier than a fog descends upon them . It is called in this country the garua . Where it sits on the mountains , the soil is drenched with moisture , and overnight , almost , plants and grasses spring up . Men call these grasses the loma . They make excellent feed for the cattle , the sheep , and the llamas . " " Llamas ? " Bianca echoed . " A beast not unlike a camel , but without a humped back . Truly there are many wonders in Peru . " Within the first hours of the next morning , Bianca was given proof of the truth of her husband 's words . She was awakened by the cries of sea birds , and the beat of uncounted wings . She dressed hastily and mounted the deck . Looking up , she could no longer see the sky , except as momentarily revealed patches of light between the wings of the birds . The whole heaven was blackened by them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their wing tips and made the air hideous with their screeching . Over the port bow a line of pelicans passed , their ugly sacked beaks thrust out and their small heads resting on their curved necks in the recess between their wings . Bianca watched them pass with a growing sense of amazement . Idly , she began to count them , but she wearied when she reached five hundred , and she missed count frequently because of the sameness of the birds . So she stood quietly and watched the pouch-beaked sea birds fly past until her knees ached with the standing . She shifted position and hung on , unable to tear her gaze away from the spectacle . At last she gave way to her wearinessand sat down on a coil of rope . She was still sitting there watching the pelicans when she heard the clang of the watch bell , and realized with a sudden disbelief in the evidence of her143senses that she had been watching a line of pelicans fly across the ship for two full hours and that the last bird was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side of the ship and saw that the water ahead was boiling ceaselessly . She watched this for another half-hour until the ship nosed into this white-whipped whirlpool . Then she saw that the wild white foam was the continuous splash being made as one gannet after anotherdived into the sea after fish . She stared at them until she realized that this too was not going to end , and turned her eyes to a stop just abaft of the starboard beam where a black cloud hovered over the water . She heard a step at her side , and Don Luis was pressing a telescope into her hand . " Cormorants , " he said . " Look ! " Through the glass the black cloud became broken up into a mass of individual birds , whirling across the lens so fast that they made Bianca dizzy . And above them all soared albatrosses , frigate birds , man-of-war birds , terns , plovers , and the omnipresentgulls . There was nowhere she could look without seeing the flash of wings . Even the surface of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floating shapes of the sea birds , resting quietly on the dancing wavelets with folded wings . Bianca turned an awed face toward Don Luis . " How many are there ? " she said . " God alone knows , " 1 Don Luis replied . " A man standing in one spot might wear out ten lifetimes counting them  --  and yet would not have begun . . . . Come , it is time you went below . We should reach Callao before nightfall . " But the galleon made even better speed than he had hoped . It was still bright afternoon when the cold , greenish Peruvian current flattened out into still , almost waveless waters . On their starboard the great island of San Lorenzo lay , with its low foothillsbreaking the force of the waters . Off to the port side Bianca could see the promontory aimed like a dagger straight at the heart of San Lorenzo , and beyond it the low , thatched huts of Callao . The galleon beat in against the wind , which on this1 A twentieth-century naturalist has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This flock alone consumes a thousand tons of fish a day. 144stretch of coast blows forever from the southwest , and came gracefully up alongside the wharf without having to drop anchor at all . On the wharf there was a great bustling , but a bustling in slow , dance tempo . The Indian roustabouts took the hawsers of the galleon and belayed them about the piles in a manner that stated plainly that tomorrow or the day after would have served as well . Standing beside her husband , Bianca let her dark eyes stray over the nondescript crowd . Then , abruptly , her gaze halted . For there on the wharf a young man had swept off his great plumed hat and made her a sweeping bow . As he straightened , she could see that he was uncommonly handsome , with brown hair so light that it was almost the color of honey and eyes as blue as Kit 's own . I shall always , Bianca thought miserably , have a most uncomfortable weakness for eyes of that particular shade . ... Then she turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling and returning the young man 's salute with rare good humor . " My godson , " Don Luis said . Bianca took Don Luis 's hand and came down the gangplank . At its foot , Ricardo Goldames waited , his blue eyes widening with every step she took toward him . " My esteemed godfather , " he whispered . " I am overwhelmed ! " " With your joy at my coming , no doubt , " said Don Luis , chuckling , his deep voice filled with irony . " Of course ! " Ricardo was smiling . " But also at the sight of my new godmother . I trust that the closeness of our relationship will permit me to kiss her hand . " Thereupon he did so though with a great deal more ardor than any religious dutifulness could have inspired . " Senora , " he said cheerfully , " I am desolate ! " Bianca looked at his young , handsome face on which not the slightest trace of sadness showed . " Why , senor ? " she said gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mine has snatched the fairest flower of all earth 's beauties , and hereafter I must mourn my loss in vain . " This quite outrageous statement was made so calmly and with145such a pleasant expression that Bianca took a half-step backward , glancing fearfully at Don Luis . But her husband merely threw back his head and roared with laughter . " You are not changed , Ricardo ! " Again he chuckled . " You are still a scoundrel . I warrant that the proctors at San Marcos grew so weary of your deviltry that they closed one eye at your lack of knowledge . But come , you have transportation to Lima for us , have n't you ? " " The best , " Ricardo said . " I have prevailed upon the Viceroy himself to lend me his own coach . And His Excellency hopes that you will honor him with your presence in his house during the festivities . " Bianca glanced up at her husband . This was high honor indeed . In his own right , the Viceroy of Peru was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than many a princeling of the worn-out houses of Europe . Don Luis took the invitation calmly , as no more than his due . " We accept , of course , " he said . " Lead on . " The Viceroy 's coach was a splendid conveyance , carved of quebracho wood and much ornamented with giltwork and metal fittings of pure silver . It was drawn by four of the finest horses Bianca had ever seen . The coachman and the footman were Negroes of a blackness defying description , but the sable hue of their skins set off their splendid livery all the more vividly . The whip cracked over the backs of the horses , and the coach moved off toward Lima . Despite the dust and the jolting of the heavy vehicle  --  which was entirely wanting in springs or any reasonable substitute  --  Bianca found the eight-mile journey from the seaport of Callao to the mighty capital of Lima most interesting . Ricardo talked incessantly , but Bianca heard scarcely a word . She was far too busy gazing out the window at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So far she had not seen another white face . All about her were Indians talking quietly in their liquid Quechuan tongue , moving slowly over the dusty highroad driving their herds of llamas or alpacas before them . She noticed that one of the strange camellike beasts was lying down and , despite a shower of blows from his driver , was refusing to get up. 146 147 " This , " Ricardo said , grinning , " is worth seeing . " Putting his head out the window , he called to the driver to halt . As the coach ground to a stop , the incensed Indian made a grievous mistake . He moved around to the beast 's head and began to tug furiously at the bridle . At once the llama lifted its slim head and spat a mouthful of foul green liquid into the Indian 's face . The Indian sprang back , wiping his blinded eyes . Then he whipped out a knife and sprang at the animal 's throat . " Stop ! " Ricardo cried . " You know better than that ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned a sullen face toward the young Spaniard . Slowly he sheathed his knife , and walked around to the side of the squatting beast . He opened the great bag it carried and handful by handful began to throw out the dried maize it contained . He had thrown out no more than ten small handfuls when the llama gave a low , contented grunt and got awkwardly to its feet . " You see , " Ricardo said triumphantly . " A llama has far more brains than an Indian . He knows how much he can carry . There are times , " he added ruefully , " when I myself have been less wise . " Then he put his head out the window again and ordered the coachman to go on . They followed the curves of the Rimac River past the thatched adobe huts of the Indians . The stench of the cooking fires smote them in the nostrils . Bianca lifted a perfume-drenched handkerchief to her nose and glanced inquiringly at Ricardo . " Taquia , " he said . " Dried llama dung . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the beasts , they would have no fuel . Everything here depends upon nature . You have seen the birds ? Well , we send ships out to their nesting places , which return loaded with their offal . We call it guano  --  and with it we enrich the land . " " I think , " Don Luis growled , " that this is hardly a subject to talk about to your godmother , Ricardo . " " A thousand pardons , senora , " Ricardo said . " Here in our barbaric land it is easy to forget our manners . " " Not that you ever had any , " Don Luis observed . " Is n't that Lima ahead ? " Bianca put her head out the window and took her first look at the capital of the great viceroyalty . Lima , she saw at once , was a great city  --  a great Spanish city . The spires of the cathedral , the cabildo , the Casa Real , rose in the faintly misty air . As they moved into the city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lima  --  was altered but not dispelled . Through the streets shuffled hundreds of Indians , the descendants of the proud Incas , now broken and dispirited . They moved with bent heads , their colorful serapes and rebozos picking up the light , gleaming dully brown and blue and white and green over their bent shoulders . Before them moved the herds of mules , sheep , cattle , llamas , and alpacas . These latter , unlike the hardier llamas , were bearing no burdens , being driven in merely for the shearing . Here in this quarter the filthy huts of plastered mud , shared alike by Indians , goats , pigs , and chickens , assailed Bianca 's gaze . The naked children stared back at her with great wonderingeyes . Then the earthen streets of the Indian quarter gave way to the paved avenues of the Spaniards , and the **25;3647;TOOLONG of the mighty stared forbiddingly down upon them . Through the middle of the street the stinking gutters ran , and now and again a window of an upper story opened , to reveal some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , with a mumbled cry of " Agua va ! " she would unceremoniously dump the foul-smelling contents into the street , and woe betide the passer-by who failed to dodge ! Bianca shuddered , seeing all this . However , Lima was alive with pageantry , too : the caballeros on their fine steeds , dressed in velvets stiffened with embroidery and sitting tall in their splendid gold-inlaid saddles ; the dark eyes of the limenas peeringcoquettishly through the curtains of their coaches at the magnificent charros in their broad-brimmed hats edged with silver and gold lace , fur-trimmed and embroidered jackets , silverbuttonedpantaloons , leather leggings and immense silver stirrups and spurs , raising their ivory-inlaid whips in gallant salute to the senoritas . Lines of goldsmith shops vied with the even more numerous ones of workers in silver . Portuguese Jews , whose wealth and business acumen had won them a measure of security148from the grasping fingers of the Inquisition , hurried through the streets intent upon their drafts and papers . Nuns and bearded friars lent a note of sobriety to the otherwise brilliant throng . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseased paws even into the windows of the coach , so that Don Luis was forced to strike them with his cane . Here too were the Negroes , permitted by law to wear the cast-off garments of their masters , so that it was easy to tell a mulatto from a mestizo , though in coloring and features they might be identical . Here were the women of the town , gay , abandoned , noisy , of every race and hue and combination thereof . Jewels sparkled on hatbands ; mere merchants adorned themselves with almost priceless pearls . Even the half-breed women , the lovely mestizas , wore sandals and belts of silk and gold , with pearls and rubies  --  presents , no doubt , from doting hidalgos , as were their ornamented skirts and jackets of fine cloth . On the walls of the public buildings the rude scrawls prohibiting public nuisance testified to the want of even the rudiments of delicacy or restraint among the people , but half a glance sufficed to show that these warnings had no effect . Bianca turned her scarlet face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ears . Looking out , she saw a crowd of Negro retainers engaged in a furious brawl . One group , dressed in bright liveries of green and gold , was having much the better of it . They were armed with short swords , pikes , and daggers , while the others , whose much more splendid livery was of gold and royal purple , had only staves . Don Luis turned questioning eyes on his godson . " The blacks in green , " Ricardo explained , his tone full of good-humored enjoyment of the bloody riot , " are the retainers of the rector of the university . Of all the slaves in Lima , they alone are permitted to wear sidearms . The others are the servants of the Viceroy , who hold it ill that they are not so honored . They fight every time they meet . All the blacks  --  those of the Archbishop , the oidores , and the regents of the Audencia  --  hate the Negroes of the rector worse than poison . They always attack them , which is most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , here come the officers of the guard ! " The officers of the guard , heavily armed and wearing coats of149mail , swept down on the brawling Negroes . For a moment the uproar increased , then abruptly it ended . The guards had brought the shafts of their heavy pikes down over the heads of half a dozen blacks , leaving them sprawling in the street . The rest stared down the gaping muzzles of the muskets of the guards and discretion took precedence over valor . The driver of the coach cracked his whip , and the heavy vehicle moved on toward its destination . That night Bianca sat at the fiesta table and tried to follow the light chitchat of the conversation . At the head of the table the Viceroy himself was suffering from mild social confusion . The recent elevation of Don Luis to the rank of count had upset protocol . The Count of Monclovia knew how to talk to his inferiors . If Don Luis had been a mere grandee , he could have dealt with him with graceful condescension , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was at a loss . Don Luis 's dry , halfironicremarks did nothing to help the situation . Little by little he was letting Monclovia know that in wealth , in extent of holdings , in everything except the office of viceroy , he exceeded his superior officer . The silences between the two men lengthened . Bianca too found the evening difficult , but for a different reason . Across the table from her , Ricardo Goldames 's glances dwelt more and more on her face . And his eyes were naked with adoration . She wanted to warn him , to tell him to turn aside his gaze , but the women prattled on . Bianca was sure that they had noticed , that every senora in the great salon was aware of this wild and secret indiscretion . The evening dragged on , every moment crawling with leaden feet over her tortured nerves . When at last it was over Bianca found that she was to be alone except for Quita , for Don Luis had been summoned to discuss urgent matters of state . Sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night-black hair , Bianca was not even surprised when small stones thudded against her window . Quita smiled slowly and prepared to depart. 150 " No ! " Bianca said , her voice high , breathless , filled with terror . " Stay  --  I need you . " Then step by slow step she crossed to the barred window and stared down at Ricardo Goldames. 13SOMETIME DURING THE NIGHT of July 1 , 1694 , the great clockof time stopped for Cristobal Gerado . He was made aware of it by the stars . On many a night before , while the Sea f lower swung at her creaking hawsers , anchored in some quiet cove , he had seen them wheel in great white circles above the masthead . Sometimes under full press of canvas , the sails tugging at the sheets , he had watched them reel and dip with the cadenced rise and fall of the leeward rail . There had been a slow and awesome majesty about their dance , as though if a man listened hard enough , he might be able to attune his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , they were still . It was , Kit knew , simply because he saw them from the land  --  more exactly , through the stout iron bars of the Port Royal gaol . Strange , he mused , that never since my youth have I watched the stars from land ... . The stars were the seaman 's friends , guideposts in the great inverted bowl of heaven , but now they were still , for time had stopped . . . and his life , too , would presently stop with it . Sighing , he looked at the humped silhouettes of his crew , black and motionless in the fetid darkness . The gaol was scarce a year old , but already it had taken on the noisome stench common to dungeons everywhere , reeking with human smells and more  --  the indefinable gaol odor , the sweet-sick putrefaction scent of liberty dead and hope lying rotting . He shook his head to clear it of such thoughts . Oddest of all , it seemed to him , was the fact that he did not want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Rouge was dead , and by his own hand . Bianca was perhaps worse than dead  --  living152in the loveless thralldom of his ancient enemy . In either case , he was powerless to remedy the situation . On the morrow it would be remedied for him . The choking embrace of hemp would assuage his griefs forever . He heard the swift-scurrying passage of rats in the darkness , then the low intonation of Patricio Velasco 's prayers : " Hail Mary , full of Grace , the Lord is with thee . Blessed art thou among women . Blessed is the fruit of thy womb , Jesus . Holy Mary , Mother of God , pray for us now , and at the hour of our death . . . . Amen . " He found his own lips repeating the solemn words , murmuring , " Sancta Maria , Mater Dei , ora pro nobis peccatoribus , nunc et in hora mortis nostrae ! " He crossed himself reverently at the end , and saw from the movement of Bernardo 's great shoulders that the Jew was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melted : Bernardo could pray in two religionswith no sense of conflict . The heretic Smithers knelt alongside the Catholic Velasco , and the sins of them all were heavy burdens of scarlet on the nakedness of their souls . Kit heard the rustle of motion as Bernardo rose and approached him . The great hands groped through the darkness and found his shoulders . " Kit , my son , " Bernardo whispered , " forgive me . I brought you to this . " " We could not have fought , " Kit reminded him . " They would have sunk us with ease . " " Yes , but better that death than this . Better a clean death at sea than this filthy , dishonored dying . " " Fret no more about it , my old one , " Kit said gently . " It is good that we end the voyage as we began it  --  together . " " Kit , " Bernardo began , but the sound of footsteps halted him . Every man in the dank common cell was on his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Avast , ye rogues ! " he bellowed . " Stand back ! I have a visitor to see Christopher Gerado  --  and mark ye that ye show her every courtesy ! It would please me to add a taste o ' the cat to what awaits ye tomorrow . " The key turned in the massive lock , and the door creaked153open a little , just wide enough to admit the slender figure of Rosalind Parish . She held a lantern in her hand , and by its light Kit could see that her blue eyes were filled with tears . The moment she saw him she passed the lantern to Bernardo and sank on her knees before Kit , her whole body shaken with sobs . Kit stretched out his hand to her . " Get up , " he growled . " This is not fitting . " Instead of rising , she caught at his hand and covered it , back and palm , with kisses . Kit bent and raised her gently to her feet . Then he glanced around at the others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his eyes . " The wench might save us yet ! " The men drew apart hastily . Rosalind 's white arms stole up and encircled Kit 's neck . " I am sorry , " she said , weeping . " God and His Angels witness that I love you ! " " So much , " Kit remarked dryly , " that you send me to the gibbet with your lies . " " I  --  I know , " she said at last , her voice scarcely a breath . " I have been to see the magistrate to tell him the truth . He refuses to believe it . Oh , Kit , can you forgive me ? Say that you can ... . Please  --  for the love of God . " Kit looked down at her , his blue eyes luminous in the semidarkness . " My life is nothing to me , " he said gravely . " And for it , I forgive you freely . But why did you do it when a word from you would have freed us ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " Consider , Kit , I was never really in love before . I married Reginald thinking I could learn to love him , but I could not . I have taken lovers  --  out of bitterness , out of hatred for the fop that he was  --  but I am a decent woman at heart , that you must believe . . . . Say that you believe me , Kit . " Kit smiled above the bright crown of her head . This he could grant her ; this small comfort he could give her before he died . " I believe you , " he said gently . " Go on . " Rosalind raised her head and searched his face . It was grave and calm . With a glad cry she went up on tiptoe and kissed him . " When you came , when you saved me , everything stood still for me . " " And then ? " " And then you scorned me . I know it was my fault . I was lacking in subtlety . I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had felt your arms and I was on fire . Kiss me , Kit  --  kiss me . " She was oblivious to the mockery in his deft embrace . At last she sighed , slowly and with deep content . She drew back a little , and her hand disappeared in the bodice of her gown . It came out holding a razor . " Here , " she whispered , " take it and shave off your beard ! Your hair and mine are much alike in color . I will strip off these garments and you shall change with me . Before morning you should be far away . " Kit threw back his head and laughed . " You have read far too many romances , Rosalind ! " he said . " Look  --  I am over six feet in height . Your gown would swirl about my knees . That bodice of yours would rip into pieces if I forced it over my shoulders . No , Rosalind , I fear that I must accept my fate . " " Try it ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloak and bent your head . . . The skirt contains much cloth . I could let it down so that ... " " No , " Kit said gently . " Even if I could , I would not leave my men . I hope that you will enjoy the spectacle tomorrow . " Again she hurled herself upon him , convulsed with such a titanic upheaval of grief that her wild sobbing brought the turnkeyhurrying to the gate . He put his head through the bars to see the better and opened his mouth to bellow at them , but no sound came out  --  no sound at all . For Bernardo 's enormous hands were encircling his neck . Kit saw the man 's eyes bulge from their sockets , saw the sweat rise and glisten on his forehead in the dim light of the lantern , then the man 's ugly face turned blue and his tongue came out of his gaping mouth . Bernardo hung on long after he was dead . Then , holding the turnkey effortlessly with one hand , he sought and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cat-o ' - nine- tails , " Bernardo said contemptuously . " Sleep well , you obscenity , until Satan wakes you up in hell ! " " The streets are alive with soldiers , " Kit observed . " Let us decide on a plan . " " No , " Rosalind said , " there will be no soldiers . Captain Neilsonassured me of that . They are all at the tavern , being entertainedat his expense . " " And the guards at the doors ? . . . " Smithers growled . " They have drunk by now at least a gallon of sack I brought them with the good Captain 's compliments . " " Uncommonly thoughtful of him , " Kit mused . " Why should he be so kind to me , Rosalind ? " " Because I asked him to . Also because the verdict angered him . He said that he would be pleased to meet you at the cannon 's mouth on the open seas , but that he 'd be damned before he 'd serve at the hanging of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real man ! " Bernardo grunted . Kit stared at Rosalind a moment , then turned to his crew . " Away , lads ! " he said softly . " Make no sound . We will seize the Sea f lower . We can rig two gun tackles at each side of the whipstaff socket and station a man at each . A tug at the ropes and she will heel right handily . And God knows there 's no vessel afloat can catch her . Come ! " With the ease born of long practice they went down on their bellies and worked their way through the corridor . The gates opened one by one to the keys on the iron ring that Bernardo had taken from the turnkey . At the gates , the guards fell an easy prey , one to the butt of the turnkey 's pistol , the other to Bernardo'sencircling fingers . " " Scatter ! " Kit commanded . And make for the harbor . We will reassemble there . " By the time they had all reached the place where the Seaflowerlay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pistols , and cutlasses they had taken from the drunken soldiers they had met reeling through the streets . At the end of the wharf they slipped into the water and swam out to the Sea f lower . Coming up on her decks , they swarmed over the sleepy Britishers who guarded her . They used belaying pins , musket butts , pistol barrels , and the flat of their cutlass blades , for out of respect to Captain Neilson , Kit had ordered156that there was to be no killing . Then they loaded their unconsciousvictims into a longboat and set it adrift . Bernardo and a picked group worked feverishly at the jury tackle . In twenty minutes they had it rigged . Soon the square sails bellied out on the foremast , the spritsail ballooned , the white triangles of the flying jibs caught the fresh night wind , the great spanker on the main heeled hard over , its boom almost at right angles , and the Sea flower moved out of the harbor , running free before the wind like a spirited thoroughbred that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in less than two days , steering southward toward the lower peninsula , for at the command of Ducasse their old haunt at Tortuga had been deserted , the entire town of Basse-Terre having been moved to Port de Paix . When they finally reached the harbor of Petit Goave , the men turned gleeful eyes toward the white town sliding in toward them . over the port bow . True , the English had taken back the Negroes with which the crew had hoped to gain a fortune . However , they had not bothered to search for the loot the men had taken from the manor houses , thinking , no doubt , that they would have time and to spare to search the Seaf lower 's hold after the hangings . There was enough left , the men knew , for one brave rout . Watching Kit 's face , Bernardo was aware that he did not share the mood of his crew . One would think , Bernardo mused , that he was going toward the gibbet rather than away from it . When the Sea f @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men , adding liberally , to their loot from his own share . Then , after having told them to hold themselves in readiness if he should require their services again , he and Bernardo went down the ladder into the last of the boats . That night every bawd in Petit Goave and above half of those from the near-by town of Leogane descended on the tavern in which the Seaf lower 's crew celebrated their return . These were reinforced by many of the young matrons and maids of the town who so far had escaped the professional status . Kit , however , was not present . Bernardo sighed as he contemplated the plump little maid who was turning a most attentive ear to his157flattery . Time enough tomorrow to console his captain , tonight there were more attractive prospects in view . He was not to go uninterrupted . An hour later he looked up from the lips of his companion into the smiling face of a richly attired courtier . The man was obviously a gentleman . Even to Bernardo 's rum-bemused eyes he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his feet . " A thousand pardons , Monsieur Diaz , " the man murmured . " It pains me deeply to interrupt your most pleasant occupation , but I am here in behalf of His Excellency "  --  Bernardo stiffened in anticipation  --  " who urgently wants to see Captain Giradeaux . The Sieur Ducasse asked me to congratulate the entire company on their miraculous escape , and to present every man with a purse as a token of his gratitude and esteem . I trust you will see to the distribution of the money ? " Bernardo grinned . " That I will ! But as for Captain Giradeaux , I do not know his present whereabouts . " " A pity . Still , there is no great haste . His Excellency is much taken with the young captain . He desires to reward him suitably for the great part he played in the late expedition . " " I will have him at Exter , " Bernardo promised solemnly , " the day after tomorrow at the very latest . " " My thanks , Monsieur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . . . " He held out a huge leather sack , crammed to the bursting with gold pieces . Bernardo saw at once that here were at least a hundred gold louis for every man . Catching the courtier 's arm to prevent his escaping , he sprang to a table and bellowed in a forecastle voice : " Look , my lads ! Gold ! From the land of His Excellency the Sieur Ducasse ! Give a cheer to his messenger ! " The men shook the rafters with their lusty hurrahs . The bewildered gentleman found himself hoisted to the shoulders of two sweating , evil-smelling seamen and paraded about the hall , half the trulls in the place smearing his hands with winy kisses . The courtier took these attentions with good grace , and made them all a flowery speech in beautiful Parisian , which the bearded buccaneers and their blowsy women only vaguely understood . But if he thought he was going to be permitted158to escape , he soon discovered his mistake . He found himself seated at a table with a lithe quadroon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his manicured hands . After three pulls at the tankard , he began to relax ; after five he found , to his amazement , that he was actually enjoying himself . Besides , the quadroon was lovely . When the dawn light poured into the windows , the fine Parisian gentleman , his rich attire in disarray , was roaring a lusty sea chantey with as much fervor as any sea wolf in the tavern . When Bernardo recovered himself enough to recollect his promise , it was afternoon . He was , he realized , no longer in the tavern , but in a room belonging , in all probability , to the plump maid . By a mighty effort he raised his head , now of ten tons ' burden , and surveyed his surroundings . His surmise had been correct . The girl slept , in all her voluptuous innocence , by his side . Bernardo lowered his great head and groaned . Of what worth were pleasures taken in the dark that a man could not remember in the morning ? But such thoughts must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Groaning again , he heaved himself erect and began to dress . When he had finished and started for the door , he glanced down . The plump maid , her skin dewed all over with a faint film of perspiration , had not even stirred . Bernardo made the doorway in one great lurch , and stood outside blinking blindly at the brilliant light . He knew where to find Kit . Half an hour later he came to the door of a small hostel that was vastly unpopular in Petit Goave because the angular Huguenot widow who kept it insisted upon at least the appearance of respectability . He had no excuse to enter , because Kit was standing there beside his white stallion , holding the lead rope of a pack mule in his hand . Bernardo 's brows made pothooks of questioning . " It is no concern of yours , " Kit said almost cheerfully , " but if you must know , I am bound to Notre Dame de Leogane to pay a call on Father Dumaine . " Bernardo surveyed the heavily laden pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "
