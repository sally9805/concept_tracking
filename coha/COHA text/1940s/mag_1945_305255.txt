" The giggle is a dirty Caspar . The cattle are aggieing about him . " <P> If a visiting lecturer had chanced to overhear this remark at Mooseheart , Ill. , site of a Loyal Order of Moose home &; school for some 1,000 orphans , he would either be mystified or mortified . Translated from recorded Mooseheart slang , the remark means : " The visiting lecturer is a very queer person . The girls are gossiping about him . " <P> The first study of slang in this small community , a self-contained unit ideally suited for the purpose , was made in 1930 by Leonard W. Merryweather of the Mooseheart School . Recently Psychologist Edmund Kasser made a second study . In the current Journal of Genetic Psychology he reports that : <P> Of 135 slang words used in 1930 , only 18 survive in the current slang vocabulary of 78 words . ( The decline , says Kasser , is the result of better teaching . ) <P> Although the children are freely exposed to visitors , movies , newspapers , most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current 78 , they made up 45 . <P> Perhaps because of better relations between the children and their supervisors , old names for Mooseheart staff members-sluefoot , screw , night-caller , supreme being , walking tree-have died . An increase of tolerance has presumably caused the disappearance of such words as fish and fisheater ( both meaning Catholic ) , and aquarium ( a Catholic priest 's home ) . Also gone are smutch ( sneak-out ) , squirrel ( psychologist , i.e. , one who looks for " nuts " ) . <P> Current words include snags ( tonsils ) , tank ( stomach ) , hilk ( an interjection indicating embarrassment ) , storky ( tall , scrawny ) and bughouse ( the Mooseheart Laboratory for Child Research ) .
