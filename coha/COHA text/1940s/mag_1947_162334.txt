Two of The Netherlands ' top plant pathologists arrived in Washington , D.C. last week on an important commercial mission . They were there to talk the Department of Agriculture out of limiting imports of Netherlands bulbs ( 1946 imports : $8,000,000 ) . The department wanted to cut bulb shipments to " amounts needed for propagation . " Its ostensible reason was the threat of importing contagious plant diseases along with the bulbs . <P> But the real pressure for the ban had little to do with disease ; it came from Washington and Oregon nursery men , who resented the popularity of Dutch bulbs among U.S. home gardeners . Whispered one member of the department : " The problem is commercial , but we are trying to solve it biologically . " <P> Squaw Grass . Such biological warfare annoyed not only the Dutch , but also Mrs. Frank Ball , representative of the Virginia State Federation of Garden Clubs , who is convinced that without Dutch bulbs , U.S. gardens will degenerate into " patches of broom sage and squaw grass . " Cried Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutch the opportunity to earn in trade the very dollars we are called upon to give them ? " <P> But while the department deliberated , the Dutch government took its own swing at free trade . <P> One of Holland 's largest corporations is the Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. , a $440,000,000 concern . An estimated one-fifth of its stock , or $45,000,000 worth , is held by U.S. investors , who , like the Dutch stockholders , have first option to buy any new shares issued . Last week the company announced a whopping new $114,000,000 stock issue . But the Dutch government , by means of new currency controls , virtually froze U.S. investors out . <P> Investors could buy the new shares only in Holland and at the official rate of 38 to the guilder , more than three times the free market rate in New York . They could either sell their options in the U.S.-at a huge discount caused by the Dutch regulations ; or in Holland , where the proceeds would be frozen . The Dutch blandly said they were only trying to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made a pretty good answer to the U.S. 's highhanded threat to ban bulb imports .
