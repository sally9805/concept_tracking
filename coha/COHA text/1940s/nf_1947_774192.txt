txt  | It is a well-known fact that frequency of intercourse is considerably greater in newly married couples than in those married for a period of years . It can be safely assumed that normal persons can determine without difficulty how often they desire complete intimacy with each other . They are not likely to go wrong if each act is an expression of love to the point of mutual orgasm and entire satisfaction . The quality of the embrace is more important than the intervals between repetitions of it . And sex play short of orgasm has its place , where both enjoy it . Masculine Sex Hygiene . A man may well wash his penis every day with soap and warm water , dry it with a cloth or absorbent paper , and even powder with a good grade of scented talcum . In the uncircumcised this will prevent the accumulation of white , bready material that tends to form beneath the foreskin after a few days . This secretion , known as smegma , has an objectional odor . The warm , moist incubator underneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease . The occasional individual who has a long foreskin with a small opening that hinders or prevents complete retraction ( " skinning " ) may develop accumulations of smegma calling for circumcision . Young boys occasionally suffer from an annoying inflammatory condition around the head of the penis and just back of it . This is readily amenable to treatment with soap and water , followed by drying and application of talcum powder . Ointments , such as vaseline , can be used , but the dry powder treatment is quicker and better . Feminine Sex Hygiene . Every woman should have either a fountain syringe with a vaginal nozzle ( long , slightly curved ) or a large vaginal bulb syringe . In some women a douche is advisable after each menstrual period . The natural secretions from the cervix present in the vagina and the whitish cells of the shed lining have a characteristic odor . In some women no odor is perceptible , while in others it is quite objectionable . A certain amount of caressing or fondling of the female genitals is part and parcel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odorless as a rule , in other cases it does have odor and a man washes his hands and parts after coitus . The douche material may be warm water . Many proprietary products are widely advertised for use in maintaining " feminine hygiene , " but under this label most are intended for contraception , however ineffective . Such products are too expensive for use as cleansing agents , and for this purpose  | they are not better than good soap and water or vinegar , two tablespoons to the quart , as this latter matches the normal slight acidity of the vagina . Many women , if indeed not all of them , show more or less of this whitish secretion derived from the slight steady shedding of the surface layers of the passage , just as our skin is constantly invisibly peeling its surface cells . If this is considerable it may appear at the vulva or after intercourse . If a man withdraws temporarily , as in play of one kind or another , and sees a little " leukorrhea , " it might seem to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vulva , with soap and water should thus he done daily . There is little that is more attractive than daintiness . And there is little that leads more happily to this loving closeness in marriage than knowledge that brings liberation from the old blockades of shame and repression ? to train expertness and variety in mutual satisfactions . There are few expressions of gratitude that come to medical advisers or other marriage counselors that are more keen and enduring than those which are the outcome of perfected ? or corrected ? adjustment of the interlocking spiritual , mental , and physical act of love between husband and wife .  | Nearly everyone agrees that people need to know much more about sexual adjustment in marriage . Such difficulty is by no means the only cause of divorce and separation . Yet the increasing separation and divorce rates , as well as the increased amount of extramarital sexual indulgence , are an indication that many married couples are not finding sexual compatibility and happiness . Some authorities blame the woman and her lack of interest in sex and her failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the male . Others say the man is chiefly responsible because of his inadequacy as a lover . Conservative estimates report that less than half of the marriages show sexual compatibility . Less conservative ones indicate that not one marriage in ten has a satisfactory sexual relationship . Today 's woman is doubtless by reason both of biological endowment and sociological training less prone to physical response . But the father of the daughter today is conditioning somebody 's wife of tomorrow . We rarely meet an American man who is n't doing his best to discourage the development of any sexual interest in his daughter toward other men of her age and class . Not only can the man be indicted as an inadequate lover with his new wife , but he is also working to perpetuate what he complains most bitterly about ? i.e. , the sexual frigidity of the American woman . We have the woman complaining that her husband never shows any interest in her or any tenderness toward her unless he desires sexual relations . He is unappreciative of her daily activities . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to excite her through caresses , kisses , soul endearments . When intercourse begins he is not enough interested in the  | position assumed , the timing of orgasm , or in his verbal appreciation of her as a love partner to make her happy . The man in turn complains that his wife is never interested in sex relations , or ca n't be made interested often enough , or is not appreciative enough of his advances . Or in sex relations she is physically inactive , emotionally unresponsive , takes too long to come to orgasm , or has no orgasm at all . She may even be critical of him as " low , " " bestial , " " brutal , " " lustful , " " unaesthetic , " " ungentlemanly , " or " lacking the proper appreciation of her " in wanting to have intercourse with her . Millions of married people want to love and appreciate each other , and they are able to do so in every other way , but they disapprove of each other in sexual relationships which potentially hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FAULTY ATTITUDES ? Why is the sexual situation so bad at present ? The difficulty begins in childhood when the mind is being formed . Adults have so much fear of the sexual impulse ? far more fear than is warranted . There are two basic urges in mankind ? sensual gratification and aggression . The former is no more dangerous to society than the latter ; in fact , less so . Yet aggressive impulses are not feared as the sexual impulses are . Fighting is discouraged among children , but it is not taboo . In fact , sports and games are encouraged and even open fistic encounters among boys are regarded as desirable to the child 's development . Even murder , while condemned , can be discussed with children and they are allowed to see it in the movies and the comics and hear about it on the radio , but that same child must not hear of sex . Is sex more powerful or more malicious to man 's welfare than aggression ? We think not . Yet sexual activity ? the only means of complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earliest days onward . It is assumed we have the power to control aggression but that we can not control our sexual desires . Now truthfully we have n't controlled our aggressive impulses . But we are at least wise enough to admit we have them . We have various agencies working at modifying our aggressions ? racial , religious , industrial , and even those leading to war waged country against country . This is progress , and we must be equally progressive in the realm of sexuality . We must admit we have sexual impulses and needs ; that they have a purpose ; that they can be misused ; but that they can also be controlled and used constructively . In fact , we have n't begun to tap the reservoir of value that lies in more  | wholesome and satisfying body relationships . This is true not only between man and wife but also between mother and child and even father and child . We have been made afraid and ashamed to be close to one another and enjoy one another . Until we overcome this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall ever bring our aggressive and destructive forces under satisfactory control . THE INFANT AND ITS MOTHER The infant likes to be close to the mother ? to enjoy the warmth and touch of her body and nurse from her breast . This is all-satisfying and gives him a sense of well-being . It is the forerunner of happiness , tolerance , magnanimity , gentleness , and generosity . Even when the child has given up the breast for other foods he will want to snuggle up to the mother in a gradually diminishing amount for several years . In fact , it hits a minimum only around the age of ten , to break forth afresh at puberty , but now directed , instead of toward the parent , toward a member of the opposite sex of his own age . This is the rhythm of life ; this is psychosexual development . It needs guidance and fostering rather than the taboo , criticism , and silence which has prevailed for so long . As the child leaves the nursing period and goes through toilet training he need not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training completed . Co-operation in these as well as other social obligations can be achieved without invoking shame , anxiety , and criticism . This is most important because love is made with the organs associated with excretion . Put morbid emotional attitudes around the excretory organs and you have involved the organs of love . True love is expressed with the eyes , the lips , the hands , and with a clothed embrace , but in marriage the ultimate expression of love must be with the unclothed body and a union of the genital organs . If the latter are regarded as shameful , disgusting , or otherwise unaesthetic , the sexual union can never be an act of happiness or beauty for that person . The man who said , " I can not think of anything more horrible and revolting than a man on top of a woman in sexual intercourse , " expresses a lurking feeling in most humans , even in the minds of some of those who feel themselves most sophisticated about and in accepting sexual relations . It is inconsistent twaddle for adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship ( meaning the sexual relation in marriage ) if they have n't given the child some glimpse of this possibility during his formative years . 1 ) uring or soon after his toilet training period he is going to meet two  | critical episodes of his sexual development . These are ( I ) when he begins to ask questions pertaining to the human sexual relation and ( 2 ) when he discovers that he can obtain pleasure from touching his own body , particularly the genital region . It is a wise and well-adjusted parent who can answer his questions calmly , sensibly , factually , and stick to what the child wants to know . It is inherent in adults to feel that " knowing " will do the child harm or that " his mind is too weak to integrate such strong stuff , " or " with his lack of judgment he will surely misuse it . " The answer to these attitudes is that knowing wo n't do him harm , sex is n't a bad or dangerous thing to absorb ( it is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and any lack of judgment he has about using sex knowledge should be neutralized by some positive useful philosophy about when and how sexual expression is acceptable and desirable . As for touching himself for pleasure , this is no threat to health , morals , or aesthetic standards . It is a natural phenomenon , necessary to awaken the genital area to a capacity for sensation and pleasure , and never produces any problem in the child who is ( I ) on good terms with his parents and ( 2 ) has playmates and wholesome interests for his age . Around the age of three the child of either sex is likely to pass through a stage of frequently touching the genitals . Nothing need be done about this except keeping the child occupied and happy and it will pass . Occasional manipulation of the genitals for pleasure may and probably will occur up to marriage , carried on in privacy . The only concern of the parent should be ( I ) that the child has no guilt or fear over the activity and that ( 2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play , and social activity that he does not fall back upon his own body too frequently as a source of satisfaction . SEXUALITY IN THE CHILD The acceptance and tolerance of sexuality in the young child is most important . Let no one erroneously assume that sexual activity does not begin this early in the human being . At this time the basic attitudes toward sexual feeling and functioning are established . If children are made to feel fear or shame or even if their interest has never been allowed to gravitate toward sex , then we allow to develop one of the most difficult conditions a physician has to treat or any husband or wife to change or any counselor to modify . Moreover , once the parent has failed to play his role adequately in this early period of attitude building ? if he has been too severe or has ignored the subject ? the child is prone never to turn back to the parent and take a trusting attitude toward him on this subject . He falls prey to the  | misinformation and the gutter information and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing we want to change . The morbidly curious or even the uninformed child between the ages of five and fourteen who has n't been given the wholesome truth about sex from his parents is likely to gather much of the worst and little , if any , of the best about the subject during these years . SEX ADJUSTMENT AT PUBERTY At puberty a new situation prevails . The sexual glands become active , sending their hormonal secretions throughout the body and adding a greater impetus to the general desire for body contact and release of sexual energy through the orgasm . In addition to the hormone factory appearing at puberty there is a social factor at work also . Adults push the young people of both sexes together in order that they gain poise and find mates , while the social environment of movies , radios , and magazines predisposes to heightened imagination and fantasy surrounding sex . In general the adult attitude toward sex at this age is no wiser than before . Parents and children are generally farther apart at this age than ever and more self-conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay discussions of sex until the teens , when the child supposedly needs it . By this time both parties are so embarrassed that neither can carry on a satisfactory conversation on the subject . So the talk is indefinitely postponed or tried unsuccessfully and ends in a sense of futility for both . Without parental guidance the child has to struggle with his sex desires himself . He may be in conflict about masturbation ; in any case , he has to undergo more of what is called repression ? pushing the dangerous subject out of consciousness by various means . Some of these phenomena of repression are quite healthy and valuable . The young person unable to gratify his love needs directly may become an exceptionally good student , athlete , musician , actor or actress , or inventor . But others less well motivated can become overpreoccupied with religion , using it not as a means of a fuller , more meaningful life but as an escape from the realities of life . In other words , to avoid the evils of sex they avoid everything constructive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal of daydreaming in which they achieve exceptional merit , having so much love and prestige from the group that they do not have to resort to home and family life for emotional satisfaction . In fact , they often look upon the home with its day-to-day physical problems in which body needs are so much concerned ( in eating , sleeping ,  | bathing , elimination , sex , illness ) as unaesthetic , uninteresting , and unworthy of the interest and enthusiasm of a remarkable person like themselves . Or , never having been taught that they must play a part in these activities with pleasure , they retain a childish attitude which , put into words , would be something like this : " Well , those things are for Mother or Father to do or for the servants to do but not for me ; I should be allowed to be a privileged character and remain aloof from these crass realities . I shall enjoy only the clean , well-ordered , already arranged , neat , gay , glamorous things of life , but nothing which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which requires persistent effort or painful thinking . " WRONG ATTITUDES TOWARD SEXUAL ADJUSTMENT The majority of parents have two or more of the following attitudes which interfere with the maturing of their children into emotionally mature young adults . They fear that ( I ) their adolescent child will have sexual experience and become morbidly unhappy over it , or ( 2 ) that he or she will have it and be a party to an unwanted pregnancy , or ( 3 ) that he will be a participant in the sexual relation and be found out and suffer some degree of social condemnation , or ( q. ) that he will have the experience and contract a venereal disease , or ( 5 ) that he will have some pleasurable experience the parent himself has missed . Now most of these are definite matters of concern and should be faced and discussed as such rather than remain an unverbalized barrier which spoils the friendship and value of closeness in the important years of adolescence . Millions of parents and their adolescent children have been on bad terms all during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicious and did not understand why he was distrustful , suspicious , of and restrictive toward the child . It would seem to be a mistake to try to train our children to go through adolescence without conflict about sex or without sexual desire . To attempt this leads to a repression of the sexual impulses , which leads to too much trouble in later life . In order to have enough sexual desire to be reasonably normal during the adult years it is inevitable that the adolescent have sexual desire . Moreover , having it is n't necessarily painful or unpleasant or dangerous . It is healthy and human . We should accept it and also the responsibility of making the children such good friends of ours that they will control it if we show them why they should . It is a sad commentary on many intelligent parents that they never seem to think of using a positive education in connection with sex by telling the child the facts and then asking him to  | control himself and live up to a certain ideal of behavior in the setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this : Facts of sexuality plus personal social ideals plus a well-balanced work and recreational program equal morally good , happy , and responsible citizens . In contrast to this let us put the formula most people are struggling and worrying along with : No facts of sexuality plus no personal or social ideal plus a restricted and empty work and recreational life ( out of the parent 's fear of the child 's coming into contact with temptation ) equal unhappiness , inefficiency , poor marital adjustment , neurosis , and personal defects contributing to alcoholism , delinquency , psychosis , and suicide . THE NEED FOR COMMON SENSE AND THOUGHTFULNESS IN CASES WHERE ADJUSTMENT IS GOOD IN THE BEGINNING Few people today realize the long history of the development of the sexual emotions . They are present at birth and have to be integrated into the rest of the personality during the whole period of growth from infancy to the day of marriage ? and even thereafter . Anyone who assumes that the sexual emotions can be ignored for a lifetime and that they will start functioning satisfactorily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in the dark ages of thought regarding the welfare of the human animal . This historical perspective of individual sexual development , as it struggles to unfold in an unsympathetic world , applied to any married person will give some indication as to whether he can make love pleasurably with his body or not . The love emotions ( including the physical expression of them ) must be in some continuous interaction with other people who are receptive . Through late childhood and adolescence some , though not all , of the physical must be withheld until marriage . This takes continuous wise and kind counseling ? not rejection . But it is also true that there are few people after marriage who do not need counsel . In the best marriages , where sexual adjustment is harmonious , the partners accept the fact that they need to help each other to derive the most pleasure from their contacts together . They need to guide and advise each other upon how the satisfaction of each can be obtained . SEXUAL ADJUSTMENT IN THE NEWLY MARRIED Each newly married couple should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy life . It is more than a luxury to be accepted if present but ignored if absent . For each married couple there are years of hard work , responsibility , and at times a variable amount of suffering ahead . To neu-  | tralize the adverse effect of life 's conflicts and struggles upon the mind a man and woman should do everything they can to find what happiness they can enjoy with each other . They need a close communion and sympathy which is so much easier to achieve if they can give each other the ecstatic happiness of frequent sexual relations . Pleasure begets gratitude , and the thoughtfulness which makes one capable of giving pleasure begets respect and love . Such a state of mind existing between man and wife is worth working for , but it does have to be worked for . There is probably no young couple so well adjusted sexually that they wo n't have to keep working at it to retain that adjustment . They must feel free to talk about their sexual desires and each feel free to say when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where one partner must avoid the dangerous attitude of seeming to have from some obscure source an innate knowledge of what is proper , aesthetic , or good . For instance , one of the partners may want to have intercourse in the daytime or early in the evening or in the morning , but the other feels that sex relations take place only late at night in bed , the last thing before going to sleep . Actually they can take place any time , anyplace , if mutual happiness is the goal . One of them may want a different position other than the usual one of the man lying on top of the woman , between her thighs . Naturally any position is acceptable which makes the partners happy . The woman may like the man to caress her a great deal in order to get her excited before the act begins , yet the man is impatient of caresses ? perhaps regards caressing the woman 's breast as childish . He should realize that when he fails to please her he runs the risk that in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Less common than the kissing of the breast is the desire to kiss other parts of the body before the act begins . The wife may desire this when it does not appeal to the man . In either case the thing for each to remember is that no laws prescribe what is good or bad for those who , loving each other , want to bring happiness to each other . They should avoid getting blocked by a feeling of " It is n't done , " " Nice people do n't do it , " or even the more smug statement , " I may not be able to say who condemns it , but I have an instinct for decency and I know it is n't right . " Such convictions in matters of sexual activity preclude mutual adjustment and are unfortunate . If a young married couple have a good sexual adjustment to begin with they must take care not to disturb it through selfishness in behavior . For instance , the husband should continue to be tender and affectionate during mcnstruation . He should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness , the last month of pregnancy , and the first few weeks after the birth of a child . The wife should be considerate in her demands if the husband is overtired from work , but in her defense we must insist that the husband is n't continuously too tired . If so he is either in the wrong job or is organically ill , neurotically working too hard , or suffering from a neurasthenic neurosis in which chronic fatigue is one of the symptoms . Neither partner should be averse to giving the other orgasm manually should they desire it in any situation where normal relations are temporarily not possible . In short , plain human consideration on the part of two reasonably well-adjusted people should keep a good adjustment working . The importance of that consideration can not be overemphasized , however , as many such people have let a good adjustment deteriorate through carelessness , thoughtlessness , and laziness until a major amount of counseling on the part of an expert and much hard work on their part have to be done to get things in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE ONE WHO HAS A PROBLEM IN SEXUAL ADJUSTMENT There is a great tendency for the person with a difficulty in sexual adjustment to avoid facing it and doing something about it . There are many reasons for this . Having been brought up to think of sex as a shameful , dirty , unbecoming aspect of one 's behavior , he is reticent to discuss it . Never having dealt with sex openly , he feels justified in keeping it a " personal " matter and therefore hidden from others . However , since in the popular mind the capacity for sexual enjoyment also connotes vigor and strength of a kind , the one who is unable to function adequately would like to keep his weakness hidden . It stands as an evidence of imperfection , and he finds it hard and sometimes impossible to face any imperfection in himself . For example , a wife says , " John , I feel I might obtain orgasm if you could retain erection a little longer . " Instead of replying , " Well , I wonder how that might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " ? instead of seeking out that help ? he feels criticized , is wounded , pouts , withdraws , wo n't admit he may be at fault , and insists upon continuing the present status , disregarding his wife 's lack of pleasure . Or the husband might say , " Jane , I feel you do n't give any thought to or allow any room in your mind for physical lovemaking . You make yourself very busy with other things , all of which arc important , but you ignore my recurring need of enjoying your body and your enjoying mine . " Instead of accepting this as a helpful suggestion and  | stopping to think if it is true and why it should be true , she feels criticized , cries , defends herself , says her work is not appreciated and that he is just a nasty man with a low sexy mind . Before marriage husbands and wives feel they are marrying the cleverest , the wisest , the most agreeable , co-operative person in the world , but find after marriage how hard it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything helpful or worth heeding . So the first plea to husbands and wives with a problem in sexual adjustment is to have an open mind , some degree of humility , and a continuous conviction that the other may be helpful if listened to . If the one with the greatest problem could just admit he had a problem and humbly ask for and use the help of the partner many difficulties in sexual adjustment could be solved by the husband and wife themselves . Each could act as counselor for the other . For example , the common problem of disinterest or frigidity of mild degree in the woman is best described tersely by one husband as follows : " I can never get my wife to be interested in enjoying herself sexually with me unless I take her away from home for a few days on a holiday . " The fact that she can enjoy sex away from home indicates that her frigidity is not too deep . If such a woman would realize that such a state of affairs is not good and say to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it ? " then he could say something as follows : " Be less absorbed in cleaning the house and having everything in such perfect order all the time . Give some thought to what I would like from you rather than being constantly prepared for some unexpected visitor who never arrives . Relax and read a little romantic literature once in a while . Change a little your idea of how a decent married woman behaves and be a little sexy and seductive with me and see if my appreciation does n't repay you for the effort you make . " A woman , to profit by this , would have to have more respect for her husband and his needs than for her parents ' values which made her the way she is , but that capacity for learning new attitudes and values constitutes the means and practically always the only means of improving sexual adjustment . Happiness in physical love is a gift which husband and wife give each other . A few people give it easily and naturally all their lives , but they are exceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as they grow older . Generally people improve on their ability to do things as they get older , but in love-making in marriage the common trend is more toward deterioration in the love relation . For the husband who is deficient in precoital tenderness , affection , caresses , and comes to ejaculation too soon , the very acceptance of the defect  | itself and making a resolution to do something about it do a certain amount to remedy the condition . Certainly he can control the affection , tenderness , and caressing . If he will do this and endeavor to be more considerate of his wife 's needs in between the times of intercourse and for a few times apply a mild and aesthetic ointment to the male sex organ , well rubbed in , he should achieve a much more sustained erection and love relationship for both . THE USE OF PHYSICIAN OR MARRIAGE COUNSELOR The preceding section may be a little too optimistic about what can be done by husband and wife themselves in improving their sexual relations . But we hope not . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties in sexual adjustment are rarely due to organic disease or hereditary defects . They are practically always developmental defects in the personality and remediable to the degree that people are willing to work on themselves to correct wrong habits in thinking and feeling . And anyway it is better to be optimistic than pessimistic in what people may accomplish with a little information and encouragement . For those husbands and wives who in spite of information and good will can not help each other we suggest a marriage counselor without delay . Once a problem is known to exist , the longer seeking help is postponed , the harder it is going to be to eradicate it . This is partly due to the fact that bad attitudes tend to get fixed and rigid , but also because good will ? i.e. , patience and friendliness ? in both husband and wife are so necessary to effect a change . Hence a couple should not wait until these important qualities have become dissipated in either or both partners . Since it is so hard for husbands and wives to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by consulting a third person who has had some training in the science of human relations and who can impart the necessary information , appeal for new attitudes , encourage and give approval for accomplishment , and act as referee when questions arise as to which one of the partners should defer to the other . The same rule can not be applied to every couple , since in some marriages the woman will need more consideration than average or in another marriage the husband will need more tolerance and understanding than average . While in marriage complete partnership and equality in giving each his own way should be the usual goal , there is no getting around the fact that some marital partners have more to give than others , and this may be either the man or the woman . When counsel is sought it should be the best quality available . Many  | people take their marital problems to a friend or some advertised adviser , and this is dangerous . It is an unusual occurrence to find a friend with the objectivity to be helpful . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for helping with these problems . Within the last ten years many cities have set up marriage-counsel organizations with people especially trained for helping in marriage . The Planned Parenthood Federation is taking a greater interest in marriage counseling , and a committee is now working on optimum standards for those who work in this field . A counselor , whether he be physician or layman , must have as much experience with life as possible , be as unprejudiced as possible toward either sex , not to mention being unprejudiced in regard to race , religion , political belief , and sexual expression in any form or under any condition . He or she should preferably be married , although this is not the most important qualification . He should be optimistic and be able to expect and get the best from people ; in other words , be good at inspiring , encouraging , and getting people to work together as well as being an expert analyst upon what is wrong . So after choosing a counselor in whom they have confidence a couple should work hard as on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Surely marital harmony is worth as much time , effort , and practice as is put into learning a new sport or hobby . This may seem an undignified comparison , but the fact is that people are less prone to exercise their " mental and emotional muscles " than they are their physical muscles . CASES REQUIRING A PSYCHIATRIST There are finally some cases which will be unresponsive to ordinary counseling . As might be inferred , these are cases with a much more profound personality disturbance . The psychopathology is so marked , so unconscious , or requires the combination of so much time and so much skillful handling to effect a change . One type of such cases is that in which there is so much love of self that the patients find it extremely hard , if not impossible , to think of anyone 's feelings but their own . They have been starved of love as children and hence have none to give anyone else . They have been given neither warmth nor affection nor had any example of it shown them . So during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love they possessed to themselves . They know no other way of behaving ? when they hear of altruism and devotion being shown they feel that such a person is a " sap , " a " sucker . " The women are calculating and frigid , are determined to be kept , waited on , served by men , without giving anything in return . The men  | feel women arc out to exploit them , and they reflect this feeling in their every conversation . They feel that tenderness and affection are " silly rot . " They have a conviction that there is n't anything that ca n't be bought with money , if one has enough . Both sexes are relatively disinterested in children . A man and woman of this type , each one needing so much and disinclined to give , usually avoid each other and hence usually pair off in marriage with a type of mate who can give them more . These people are referred to in psychiatric terms as narcissistic . They are often attractive and glib and hide their emptiness behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what they feel they deserve . Their explanations usually sound well until the other partner has been heard . Then their emptiness , coldness , and inability to give become apparent . Their sex problem may be simply stated . The woman may be " just frigid " or the man " just unable to maintain erection . " But this one symptom can harbor beneath the surface a lifetime of coldness , self-centeredness , stubbornness ; ungenerosity , irritability , criticism , and lack of social interest which will take two to three years of continuous psychiatric treatment to modify , and some of them are n't modifiable at all . The woman will never feel any vaginal warmth or pleasure until she learns to be warm and friendly to all . The man will never be able to have and hold an erection until he has modified the character traits enumerated . If this can be accomplished at all it can be done best by two to three years with a Freudian psychoanalyst . Some of these people can not be changed even with such intensive treatment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may become clear and the couple can be told the outlook and the decision left to them as to whether they continue together or not . There is already so much separation and divorce that any counselor is reluctant to suggest any more . Yet it must be kept in mind that living in an atmosphere of affection expressed physically is necessary to the health and well-being of most people . If we can be reasonably sure the partner can not change and the continued emotional and sexual coldness is going to be detrimental to the partner , we owe it to both parties to make the situation as regards the future as clear as possible . A physician would not expose a man or woman to live with a spouse with active tuberculosis without warning of the danger . The same holds for sexual and emotional frigidity . Close to this narcissistic type and almost a variant of it is the man or woman who is really in love with his or her own sex . These people are latent homosexuals or , psychologically at least , bisexual in nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give to the opposite sex . What is n't being used up in loving themselves goes over to their own sex . These cases are serious and require plenty of strenuous psychologic study . They must come to understand the nature of their delayed emotional development and learn to love in a more altruistic way . It can be seen that if love is n't in the mind it does n't find its expression through the genital organs . There arc women who envy the man his role in life and his sexual organs and psychologically refuse to submit to him or to feel or expose any pleasure his sexual organ might give them . There are men who envy the woman her role and who refuse psychologically to play the male role . They do not wish to give a woman an orgasm , children , a home , or any of the things a woman receives from a man . They want to be the recipients of these things themselves . If this unconscious psychologic constellation is strong enough it is surely going to interfere with the man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women who , deep within them , just ca n't get over a feeling of sin or wickedness connected with sex or a fear that they will be hurt , punished , or have to suffer in some terrible way for sex pleasure experienced . Naturally the changing of these attitudes takes considerable work with a psychiatrist . Sexual maladjustments vary in severity , depending on the severity of the personality disturbance behind them . They are all too numerous . We have to think of preventive treatment through better sex education , as we can never treat the large number of individual cases through individual treatment . Fortunately the younger clergy are taking an active interest in better personality adjustment , including the sexual adjustment , of those they marry . This will help to neutralize the strong sense of sin and guilt so long associated with sex . We need more education for marriage in the high school and college , including the sexual side of marriage adjustment . THE USE OF BOOKS AS AN ADJUNCT TO COUNSELING In the course of counseling the more normal couples or those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , the interview can be supplemented by reading . Marriage and Sexual Harmony , by Oliver Butterfield , published by Emerson Books ( 1943 ) , is a brief , concise , inexpensive , and excellent guide to the physical aspects of sexual adjustment . Ideal Marriage , by T. H. van de Velde , published by Random House ( 1926 ) , and Your Marriage , by Norman E. Himes , published by Farrar and Rhinchart ( 1940 ) , are larger , more inclusive , and more expensive , but valu-  | able for those who need more than Dr. Butterfield 's pamphlet . The Happy Family , by John Levy and Ruth Munroe , published by Alfred A. Knopf ( 1938 ) , is an excellent book to stimulate that tolerant thinking of each other which is so necessary to happy marriage and the mutual understanding necessary in the background for good sexual adjustment . Love can not survive without its physical expression . Every effort made to achieve a happier , more satisfying sexual adjustment is an effort toward healthier , more peaceful living everywhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. MEASURING THE HAPPINESS OF A MARRIAGE It is obviously impossible to identify the factors that make for successful marriage without some kind of criterion as to what constitutes marital success . One criterion is whether the marriage proves to be permanent or is later broken by divorce or separation . This criterion is useful , but it has three shortcomings : ( I ) it is an all-or-none score and measures only the extreme degree of marital adjustment ; ( 2 ) it is a criterion that can not be applied without a wait of several years ; ( 3 ) the likelihood of ultimate resort to divorce is determined not only by degree of marital dissatisfaction but also by the presence or absence of religious and moral scruples . Early investigators solved the problem roughly by having subjects rate their marriage on a five-point scale as very happy , above average in happiness , average , below average , or definitely unhappy . Hamilton ' improved the method by using a numerical index of marital satisfaction based on the answers to thirteen questions . The more elaborate techniques employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon that devised by Hamilton . *The investigations summarized in this chapter were financed in large part by grants from the National Research Council on the recommendation of its Committee for Research on Problems of Sex , Robert M. Yerkes , chairman . The author wishes also to acknowledge the valuable assistance rendered by Dr. Winifred B. Johnson in the selection and formulation of many items in the psychometric techniques which have been used . Some of the material in this chapter has been more fully treated in Chapter XVIII of the volume by ' Ferman and Oden.5  | The test we are concerned with in this chapter calls for information on fifteen aspects of the marriage , as follows : r . Proportion of outside interest the spouses have in common . 2 . Rated amount of agreement in each of ten different fields . 3 . Method of settling disagreements that arise . 4 . In a list of forty specific activities respondent ( a ) checks once those he ( or she ) enjoys doing , and ( b ) checks twice those enjoyed with the spouse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spouse if life could be lived over . 7 . Contemplation of separation or divorce . 8 . Admission or denial of present unhappiness . 9 . Preference for spending leisure with spouse . ro . Gaiety and happiness when spouses are alone together . Ii . Extent to which the spouse irritates or bores respondent . 12 . Rated satisfactoriness of the spouse 's personality . 13 . Degree of certainty that no other spouse would have been so satisfactory . 14 . Subjective rating of happiness of the marriage on a seven-point scale . 15 . In a list of thirty-eight common faults respondent ( a ) checks once those that the spouse has , and ( b ) checks twice those that have affected the happiness of the marriage.f The marital-happiness test in its present form was given in 1940 to more than six hundred members of a gifted group and to their spouses . Their average age at the time was about 30 years . All the gifted subjects in childhood had IQs in the top one per cent of the school population and when retested for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the adult generality . The intelligence scores of their spouses in 1940 averaged considerably lower than those of the gifted subjects themselves but were about on a par with scores of typical college graduates . The score weights ( credits ) assigned to the individual items and to the various possible responses to each item were based upon experimental work with several sets of tentative weights . Those finally chosen were weights which gave a suitably high correlation of each item with the sum of the remaining scores and which also gave a wide distribution of total scores . The intent was that the test as a whole should have a high degree of internal consistency and thus get at the same general factor of happiness from different angles . That this result was accomplished is demonstrated by the fact that the total scores have a reliability coefficient of .89 for each sex . More'f For exact wording of the test items see Appendix of the volume by Terman and Oden.6  | over , the score distributions which the test yields are much less skewed toward the high end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marital adjustment . The possible range of total scores is from o to loo , and the scores of the gifted subjects and their spouses extended over almost the entire range . The mean for husbands was 63 and for wives 66 . Although this difference is numerically small , it is statistically reliable ( critical ratio=3.8 ) . The difference could mean either that wives on the average tend to be a little better satisfied with their marriage than husbands are , or that wives are more willing to give verbal expression to their satisfactions . The mean happiness score was almost exactly the same for gifted wives and the wives of gifted husbands , but the mean for gifted husbands was a little below the mean for husbands of gifted wives . In the case of each sex the two distributions were sufficiently alike to justify combining all husbands into a single distribution and all wives into another . The total score gives a fairly reliable measure of the marital happiness at a given time , but it does not tell how the same person would score on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to enable an investigator to follow the happiness trends of marriages over an extended period . It is extremely significant that a test of this kind does not yield a high correlation between the happiness scores of husband and wife . For these subjects the husband-wife correlation was only .52 . Marriage is evidently a venture in which the two principals can not be guaranteed an equal share of the proceeds . A low happiness score on the part of either spouse is predictive of divorce or separation , and the wife 's score appears to be somewhat more predictive than the husband 's . II . SEX ADJUSTMENTS IN MARRIAGE The subjects who took the test of marital happiness also answered a number of questions on specific sexual adjustments in their marriage . Information requested from both spouses included usual frequency of intercourse , frequency preferred by the respondent , an estimate of the average duration of intercourse , a rating of the relative passionateness of the spouses , and a rating of how well mated they were sexually . Three additional questions asked the wife for information regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the satisfaction ( release ) which she obtained from intercourse , and the amount of pleasure and/or pain which she experienced at her first intercourse.  | A sex-adjustment score for each subject was computed by assigning weights to the various possible responses to each of the sex items . A response given most often by subjects of high happiness was considered a " good " response and was weighted more heavily than a response less associated with happiness . The maximum sex-adjustment score possible was 23 for husbands and 30 for wives , the higher maximum for wives being due to the fact that more questions were asked of wives than of husbands . Amazingly close agreement was found between the present group of gifted subjects and the less selected group of 792 couples . There was , in fact , no very significant difference between the two groups . This appears to warrant two conclusions : ( 1 ) that the subjects in both groups were probably reporting the facts as accurately as they could ; and ( 2 ) that intellectually gifted persons are just as normal in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The total score on sex adjustment correlated with marital happiness to the extent of .40 for husbands and .43 for wives . As we shall see presently , the sex-adjustment score is much less predictive of later divorce or separation than is the score on marital happiness . III . THE TEST OF MARITAL APTITUDE The test of marital aptitude to be described here is the result of several years of search for correlates of marital happiness . The work of Burgess and Cottrell ' has emphasized the importance of factors in the childhood and family background and of facts and circumstances in the immediate background of the marriage . My own data confilin in large part the conclusions of those investigators but suggest that factors of personality and temperament play an even more important role . The test given to the gifted subjects and their spouses included most of the items which Burgess and Cottrell had found predictive and all the items which had shown some evidence of validity in my earlier study . The items fall into three categories , including ( 1 ) 117 relating to personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family background , and ( 3 ) 30 on the background of the particular marriage in question . The items in the first two categories can be used with any adult subject , married or single , but those in the third category can be used only with subjects who are married . The test was given in 1940 not only to the married gifted subjects and their spouses who took the test of marital happiness , but also to 371 gifted  | subjects who had not yet married . The purpose of the test was disguised by labeling it as a test of personality and temperament . Consider first the validity of individual items in predicting scores on the happiness test . This was judged by the extent to which the item discriminated between subjects with high happiness scores and subjects with low scores . The " high " group used for this purpose was composed of 150 couples who had scored high in happiness , and the low group was composed of 150 couples who had scored low . Valid items are those showing a reliable difference between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the method . figure Responses which yielded differences having a critical ratio as high as 2.0 but less than 3.0 were given a score weight of one point ; responses yielding a critical ratio of 3.0 but less than 4.0 were given two points ; those with critical ratios of 4.0 or higher were given three points . A subject 's total score on the test was the sum of the score weights carried by all the responses the subject had made . Weights for Category z . Personality and Temperament . There were four sets of items in this category , as follows : ( 1 ) 53 items of the type used in the Bernreuter personality inventory ; ( 2 ) 34 items from the Strong vocational interest test ; ( 3 ) 16 items on the subject 's opinions about the ideal marriage ; and ( 4 ) 14 items calling for self-ratings and ratings by the subject 's spouse on fourteen traits of personality . About three fourths of the 53 items of the Bernreuter type were predictive $Another check on validity was made by comparing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the mean happiness of subjects who gave a different response on the same item . The general principle is the same as in the high-low comparison .  | , of happiness . The following carry a score weight of either two or three points for each sex , unless otherwise specified : figure  | There are 19 other items in this list with a weight of one point for one or both sexes . Only a few of the 34 items from the Strong vocational interest test were predictive of happiness with this group of subjects . Men get one point for liking picnics , Bible study , public speaking , writing letters , conservative people , and women cleverer than themselves . Women get one point for liking picnics , teaching children , contributing to charities , emotional people , Negroes , or old people . The only weight of two points for men is for liking old people and the only one of two points for women is for liking women cleverer than themselves ! Of 16 items on opinions about what constitutes the ideal marriage , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or lesser degree . Opinions about which subjects were asked to express themselves concerned such issues as whether the husband should be some years older than the wife , whether the husband should " wear the pants , " whether vacations should be taken together , whether marriage should be postponed until income is comfortable , whether the wife should be financially independent of the husband , whether the wife should have a definite budget , whether children should be given religious instruction , importance of the single standard of sex morals , and similar subjects . The fact that so many items in this list were predictive indicates that one 's happiness in a marriage is definitely influenced by the attitudes one brings to it . The traits rated were happiness of temperament , freedom from moodiness , caution vs. impulsiveness , self-confidence , freedom from emotionality , conformity to authority and the conventions , how easy to get on with , enjoyment of social contacts , persistence in accomplishment of ends , integration of life toward a definite goal , inferiority feelings , vanity and egotism , exclusiveness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been used as indicators of marital aptitude . They proved to be among the best in the entire battery , all but one of them carrying score weights of two to three points for one or both of the sexes . Weights for Category 2 . Childhood and Family Background . Items which are not predictive of happiness for either sex in this group include birth order , number of sibs , number of opposite-sex sibs , report of having experi-  | enced a sex shock , amount of " petting " during the high-school period , and rated attractiveness of the same-sex parent . Items which justify the highest score weights for these subjects include the following : Rated happiness of childhood , two points to men for " extremely happy " ; women two points if " above average . " Childhood punishment , score weight of two points for men and one point for women if there was little or no punishment . Attitude of parents toward the child 's early sex curiosity gets a weight of two points for men if it was described as " frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having experienced any desire to be of the opposite sex gets two points for men and one point for women . Lack of conflict with the father gets two points for men and one for women . On attachment to father , the husband gets two points if the response was either " very strong " or " none , " and the wife one point for either of these responses . Rated attractiveness of the opposite-sex parent gets a maximum of two points for each sex , the favorable condition being attractiveness rather than the reverse . High rating on happiness of the parents ' marriage carries two points for men and one point for women . The type of home training ( whether strict , firm but not harsh , usually or always had own way , or irregular ) gives two points to men and one point to women for any one of the first three conditions . The following have lower weights in estimating chance of happiness : Amount of religious training , history of Sunday-school attendance , church membership , rated adequacy of sex instruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adolescent shyness , preferred parent , and dominance between parents . Weights for Category 3 . Background of the Marriage . Items in this category which showed little or no correlation with marital happiness for these subjects include number of years married , length of engagement , length of time over which the couple " kept company , " number of persons with whom the subject " kept company " before marriage , rated resemblance of spouse to respondent 's opposite-sex parent , husband 's occupation at marriage , outside employment of wife after marriage , ownership of home , height of hushand , height of wife ( however , one point is given to the husband if he is not 12 or more inches taller than his wife , and one point to the wife if she  | is less tall than her husband ) , weight at marriage , change in weight of either spouse since marriage , weight deviation from the average person of the same height , number of social organizations in which the husband holds a membership , whether or not the subject wants children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's last paid occupation . Age differences between the spouses give the husband a score weight of one to three points ; three if he is 12 or more years older than the wife , two points if he is 3 to I I years older , and one if he is either o to 2 years older or 4 or more years younger . Age difference is less important for the happiness of wives , having a maximum weight of one point if the husband is of the same age , I to 8 years older , or younger by 4 years or more . That each spouse should get a score weight of one point if the husband is 4 or more years younger may be surprising , but it is in line with the data of my earlier study . On age at marriage the husband gets one point for age 23 to 28 and two points for age 29 or over . The wife gets one point if the marriage occurred between the ages 23 to 28 inclusive . The husband gets one point if the marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this item has no weight for wives . If the marriage ceremony was performed by a minister the husband gets one point , but again there is no weight for the wife . It appears that the very circumstances of the marriage ceremony about which brides traditionally are so much concerned are totally unrelated to the marital happiness of wives in this group . On length of acquaintance before marriage the husband gets one point if the acquaintance was not less than one year ; the wife one point if it was not less than six months . Apparently the woman can size up her future spouse more quickly than can the average man . This was also true in my earlier group . On number of opposite-sex friends before marriage the wife gets one point for the response " many , " the husband one point for the responses " few " or " several . " One of the most heavily weighted items in this section is the subject 's report on whether his or her parents favored or disapproved the marriage . The weights here run to three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this connection is the fact that the father 's judgment is as predictive as the mother 's . Another predictive item in this list is the respondent 's rating of the relative mental ability of the spouses . The husband gets four points if he rates his own ability as equal to or somewhat less than his wife 's , two points if he  | rates his own ability considerably less , and one point if he rates it somewhat greater . Contrary to common opinion , the least favorable condition for the husband is that he should consider himself " very superior " to his wife in mental ability . In the case of the wife it is most favorable for her to judge her own ability to be " considerably less " or " somewhat less " than her husband 's . The score weight is three points for each of these responses . The wife gets two points if she says they are " about equal , " and one point if she says her own ability is " somewhat greater . " The condition least favorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " very superior " to that of her husband 's . The story changes when we consider the difference between the two spouses in scores on an intelligence test given in 1940 . Surprisingly enough , there was only a slight relationship between the happiness score of either spouse and the difference between them in tested intelligence . A score weight of only one point could be given to each , the most favorable condition being a score by the husband somewhat superior to that of his wife . Unemployment of the husband after marriage is mildly associated with his unhappiness , justifying a score weight of one point if the amount of unemployment represented less than 20 per cent of the period since marriage . The wife , however , gets two points if her husband has experienced no unemployment . Similarly , the husband gets only one point if he has rarely or never changed his position without improving his condition , whereas this circumstance gives the wife two points . Amount of husband 's savings at marriage is relatively unimportant . The husband gets one point for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if her husband 's savings amounted to $500 or more . Regarding husband 's income at marriage , he gets one point for any response except " none , " the wife one point for any sum from $200 upward . The income of a couple at the time the test was taken is also of very low predictive value . The husband is given one point if the couple 's income is not below $ I oo or above $500 per month ; the wife one point if it is not below $ioo . This relative unimportance of income and savings is in line with the results of earlier studies . Size of the community in which the subjects live is not very important , though the husband gets two points if they live in the country . The maximum score for the wife on this item is one point . An item that shows higher correlation is the subject 's rating of his own and his spouse 's health . Three points to each spouse for either of the two ratings " perfect " or " superior , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | On number of children the husband gets a weight of one point for the response " one " or " none " ; the wife gets two points for " none " and one point for " one . " Number in excess of one gets no weight for either sex . Both this and earlier studies indicate that in our present culture the relation of marital happiness to presence of offspring is less than it is commonly supposed to be . Absolute amount of education has no predictive value , but the husband is given one point if his own education is about the same as or less than that of his wife . The wife gets one point if the husband 's education is equal to or slightly less than her own , and two points if the husband 's education is greater than her own . Husband 's present occupation shows no correlation with his own happiness , but the wife gets one point if her husband belongs to the professional class . This agrees with my data for 792 couples . Many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the great majority of them are closely in line with results previously obtained for a less selected group . It seems that many of the current beliefs regarding the importance of this or that factor in the marriage background are based upon nothing more than tradition . The maximum possible scores on the three parts of the test are as follows : figure Excluding the third group of items , which can be used only with married subjects , the maximum total for the first two categories is 155 for men and 117 for women . The reliability of the total marital aptitude score is .86 for men and .82 for women . Its validity is indicated ( i ) by the fact that it correlates with marital-happiness score to the extent of .62 for men and .55 for women , and ( 2 ) by the fact that it predicts later divorce almost as well as college aptitude tests predict college marks . On the test of marital aptitude , as on the test of marital happiness , the gifted men averaged somewhat below husbands of gifted women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had almost identical means . This suggests that if either sex is handicapped for marriage by very superior intelligence it is the man and not the woman ( as popular opinion would have it ) .  | IV . THE PREDICTION OF DIVORCE OR SEPARATION Between 1940 and the end of 1946 there were 88 marriages of gifted subjects that ended in divorce ( N=74 ) or separation ( N=14 ) . ? For most of these subjects , scores as of 1940 were available on marital happiness , sex adjustment , and marital aptitude . The relative value of these three variables in predicting marital success or failure was estimated by comparing the mean scores of subjects who became divorced or separated by 1946 with the mean of subjects whose marriage remained intact to that date . The results showed that happiness scores and aptitude scores are both predictive of marital failure , and to about the same degree , but that the sex-adjustment scores have very little predictive value . For husbands the happiness scores are somewhat more predictive than the aptitude scores . On two of the variables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predictive than husbands ' scores . For none of the three variables is the average of husband-and-wife scores appreciably more predictive than the wife 's score alone , and in the case of happiness the husbandwife average is less predictive than the wife 's score . The low predictive value of the sex-adjustment scores suggests that the role of sex , per se , in marital happiness is secondary rather than primary . Couples who are psychologically well mated show a surprising tolerance for the things that are not entirely satisfactory in their sexual relationships . The psychologically ill-mated show no such tolerance , but on the contrary are prone to exaggerate any trifling amount of sexual incompatibility that may be present . Analysis of the sexual complaints expressed by my earlier group of 792 couples gave convincing evidence that such complaints are often just a convenient peg on which to hang psychological discontent . ' The Role of Temperament . Perhaps the most important conclusion suggested by the data reported in this chapter is that one 's marital happiness is largely determined by one 's all-round happiness of temperament . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not to be confused either with Pollyannish or sugary attitudes or with the happy-go-lucky disposition . Its meaning is best defined in terms of the specific responses in the maritalaptitude test which correlate with scores on the marital-happiness test . This conclusion regarding the role of temperament in marriage is supported not only by the present study but also by results obtained from a less ? In the gifted group separation is almost always followed by divorce .  | selected group . It seems that there are persons who could live comfortably with any but the most disagreeable mate , and others who would find almost any marriage unbearable . The truth of the latter statement , at least , could be illustrated by the case histories of several of my subjects who in the course of a few years have gone through three or four marriages and as many divorces . The role of temperament in marriage is further indicated by the low correlation between the happiness scores of husband and wife . As previously noted , this was only .52 for the present group and only .6o for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so low were there not a considerable tendency for each individual to go through life in his own happy or unhappy way . This , of course , is not to say that neither spouse is ever to blame for the unhappiness of the other ; such an extreme view would be manifestly absurd . If the theory here proposed is sound one would expect to find that maritalaptitude scores are correlated not only with later marital adjustment but also with the social and general adjustment in childhood and youth . A check of the aptitude scores against many case-history variables in the gifted group has revealed a number of significant relationships . For example , women who had been rated in 1928 as having " some " or " marked " nervous symptoms averaged 8.5 points lower in the marital-aptitude scores of 1940 than women who in 1928 had not shown such symptoms . The difference is quite reliable ( CR=4.18 ) . Both men and women who had shown " some " or " marked " social maladjustment in 1922 averaged , eighteen years later , 6 points lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustment were " satisfactory . " Men with " satisfactory " social adjustment in 1928 averaged , a dozen years later , 12.6 points higher in marital aptitude than those with " some " or " marked " maladjustment ( CR=4.53 ) . The corresponding difference for women was 8. g points ( CR=3.00 ) . Men rated " satisfactory " on general adjustment in 1940 averaged 15.8 points higher in the marital-aptitude test taken the same year than men with " some " or " serious " maladjustment ( CR=9.62 ) . The corresponding difference for women was approximately r o points ( CR=7.00 ) . Checks of this kind were also made on the correlations of case-history data with scores on the marital-happiness test , and with similar results . In conclusion , we have a fairly satisfactory measure of the marital happiness of a husband or wife at a given time , and we also have at least a rough measure of an individual 's aptitude for marriage . The latter , when  | perfected , has greater potentialities for usefulness than the former because it taps more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often ephemeral ; aptitude for happiness is an abiding trait . A shortcoming of the aptitude test is that it measures only the general aptitude of a given person . What we most need is a test that would predict the compatibility of a given couple . There has been a good deal of search for the magical combinations of likes and dislikes , agreements and disagreements , resemblances and differences , that are favorable or unfavorable to marital happiness ; unfortunately , few have been found . Terman and Buttenweiser4 computed tetrachoric correlations between marital happiness and agreement and disagreement of husbands and wives in their replies to some 500 questions relating chiefly to interests , habit patterns , likes , and dislikes . There were a good many items which appeared to be valid measures of compatibility within the group studied ; however , when these promising items were tried out with another and larger group few showed much sign of being valid measures of compatibility , although many remained valid as indicators of happy or unhappy temperament in the individual spouse . The search for " good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but much work will have to be done to carry us very far beyond the present general measure of happiness of temperament . We have seen that some combinations are better than others with regard to age , education , estimated intelligence , and a few other variables . The problem is to find enough predictive combinations to yield a reliable measure of compatibility . Finally , there can be no universally valid test of marital happiness , marital aptitude , or marital compatibility . The things that go to make the " good " marriage vary from culture to culture . They are not the same for the Hindu and the Moslem , for the Samoan and the Scot , or for the peasant and the plutocrat of the same nationality and religion . They may differ as between California and South Carolina , Minnesota and Mississippi , Vermont and Virginia . Regional studies should be made for the purpose of analyzing and plotting such differences .  | NOTES 1G . V. Hamilton , A Research in Marriage . New York : Boni , 1929 . ' E. W.

Stanford University Press , 1947.  | PROFESSOR OF CHILD CARE AND TRAINING , UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI The couple are now ready to plan the wedding , since all the preliminaries of the engagement and the engagement adjustments are apparently successfully met . The wedding may be of six types : ( I ) the secret wedding , ( 2 ) the elopement , ( 3 ) a small home wedding to which only the family is invited , ( q ) a large home wedding , ( 5 ) a simple church wedding , ( 6 ) a large church wedding . THE SECRET WEDDING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of the simplest home wedding . Its disadvantages far outweigh the saving of time and money . In all other types of weddings except elopements there is a steadily heightened emotional tone leading up to and through the festivities which precede the wedding to the wedding itself . This is true of the family , their friends , and the engaged couple . The result is an emotional tone favorable to marital adjustments . After the ceremony the parents and friends are ready to release the couple from adolescence and to welcome them into the " young married group . " For the couple the high tension of the parties and the final ceremony is ready to change over into the physiological and psychological states which accompany love , including sex . The bride has been the center of attention which she knows will terminate adolescence for her and for the groom . Having been the center of the stage , which is the desire of all normal adolescents , she should now be willing to relinquish this position . All her social group and the surrounding social groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously approved to such an extent  | that the wedding has proceeded publicly . Society approves and , with the proper notices in the papers , the parties , and the ceremony , has given its final sanction . The guests have had a part in setting the stage for a successful marriage , as most of them have contributed presents with which the couple will set up housekeeping . They have had a part in the entire procedure from the announcement of the engagement to the actual starting of the couple 's home . Naturally , then , they will co-operate in making this marriage a success . Even if the wedding is a small one to which only the family is invited , these attitudes and adjustments are still present . In a secret wedding none of these things can appear . The relatives and friends who have been deceived and whose generosity has been frustrated may carry actual dislike for the couple and a conscious or unconscious desire to see the marriage fail . This is as true of the immediate family as it is of its friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if it is announced within a few days after it occurs . If it is not announced for several months , only a few men of extraordinary good will can fail to suspect an element of " shotgun " technique in the marriage . If this is complicated by the birth of a child within a few months after the marriage is announced the child carries a definite stigma and society will accept the child and its parents only if the families on both sides stand back of them wholeheartedly . Emotionally the situation may be even worse . The whole wedding procedure has been surreptitious and therefore associated in the minds of both with the fear which accompanies concealment . Fear inhibits love and produces throughout the entire physiological organism conditions which make normal sex adjustments impossible . The irritation which arises is likely to be directed by the couple against each other . The emotional pattern is one of fear and anger , not love . The first adjustments are the most important . Only in very rare instances indeed will these be good . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is announced immediately after it occurs . ELOPEMENT An elopement is also a poor method of starting married life . Frequently these elopements are not based on long engagements discussed with and approved by both families . They are a result of a sudden whim or an escape , by one or both of the couple , from something which should be faced before they marry . When the couple have decided that they prefer to save the cost  | of a simple home wedding they should nevertheless have the backing of the family on both sides and have the immediate family ? that is , mother , father , sisters , and brothers on both sides ? attend . Elopements are not on the whole successful . Statistics show they result in many more divorces than do marriages entered into in the usual fashion with a church or home wedding . THE SIMPLE HOME WEDDING The simple home wedding comes next on the list . The ceremony may be performed by any legal authority who is a friend of the family or , more frequently , it is performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to plan , as the church and the state are concerned with the adjustment of the couple . With the position of marriage as uncertain as it is today , the more social pressure that can be brought to bear to keep it together , the better . For a simple home wedding without bridesmaids the cost should not be more than that shown in the following table . figure The major expenses of this type of wedding are the trousseau and linens which present-day custom states are to be the gifts of the bride 's family . The refreshments , if they are supplied , should not cost more than fifteen dollars , since at a wedding of this sort champagne is not provided and a caterer is not employed . This type of wedding has every advantage and few disadvantages , since the expense for the groom is equally light . figure *For assistance in gathering these figures I am indebted to two members of my staff , Mrs. McDermott and Miss Dupps.  | The change from summer to winter makes no difference in the groom 's expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met . Both parents of bride and groom have come and shown their approval . The bride has appeared in the traditional bride 's clothing , complete with veil , so that her husband can remember her at her loveliest for the rest of her life . The too great excitement of complicated church weddings has been avoided and the couple have saved sufficient funds to set up housekeeping in a more normal way . The figures for an average wedding today with their expense to all concerned follow . figure  | figure It is hardly necessary to point out the general effect of overexpenditure . The parents are left with so many bills to pay that they can not easily help the couple in their normal plans . The groom has been put to an enormous expense . Unless he has saved a great deal he enters married life with a crippled financial status . The wife may have to work for several years in order to save enough to meet emergencies . Instead of entering married life relaxed , both are worried . Weddings of this type are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessions at the expense of spiritual growth . There can be little if any advantage in such increase in complications , except that they make the bride feel that she has had as good a wedding as any in her set and better than most . For families of large incomes and grooms who are well on their way toward financial success , these expenditures present no problem , but very few couples are so well situated financially . THE LARGE WEDDING The large home wedding and the large church wedding are so far beyond the means of the average family that tables of expenses for these sorts are not included here . THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS Whatever the kind of wedding , every superstition should have its inning , and there are many of these still present in modern society . The bride should wear traditional dress to give the husband the traditional impression . She should have something old , something new , something borrowed , and something blue . If throwing confetti is the custom , this procedure should be followed . Rice is dangerous , so confetti should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both indicative of fertility and is a part of many ancient wedding ceremonies in which the bride and groom eat from the same rice bowl , it seems a pity that its use has become so dangerous . If it were thrown after the couple it would be safe , but , thrown at them , it has injured a num-  | ber . Wedding customs which have their origin in primitive societies , such as carrying the bride across the threshold , " Happy the bride the sun shines on , " and " June brides are happier than other brides , " may and should be conformed to if the couple feel strongly about them . The psychological state which immediately precedes weddings other than sudden elopements should be kept in mind . For at least twenty-four hours before the actual wedding takes place there is a mounting tension in both men and women , but it appears to be higher in women . The girl begins to worry about the marriage and finally comes to the conclusion that the man is a stranger and that she does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so strong that at the last minute she will elope with someone else as an escape . Such elopements are doomed to failure . Generally the groom is in the same state and at the dinner which occurs before the wedding he may drink too much and the ushers must see him home and put him to bed . He wakes up just about in time to dress and to rush to be married . The girl has no such easy way out and must fight her fears . THE FEARS OF THE BRIDE One hundred and fifty brides have described their fears , including the final one , in very much the same language . When they enter the church and look at the groom they feel that he is a complete stranger . This feeling increases as they go up the aisle . When the groom speaks the fear may be dispelled . For some it is dispelled only when at the end of the ceremony the groom kisses the bride . Emotional disturbances of every kind are less for home weddings than they are for church weddings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in every one of the one hundred and fifty brides interviewed some fear did develop . Other things being equal , the simpler the festivities , the better . The bride and the groom are already somewhat tired from the festivities preceding the wedding , and the longer they stay with their friends in a state of high emotional tension , the less they will have to give to the wedding night . In many cases the number of parties given for the bride and groom and the complexities of the wedding itself , together with the reception which follows it , produce such fatigue in the bride and groom that the marriage may not be consummated for as much as forty-eight hours after the wedding . There are many instances in which twelve hours ' sleep is necessary to relieve exhaustion before any emotion other than irritation can arise .  | THE HONEYMOON The choice of the place for the honeymoon should have been made in advance of the wedding and in the light of the financial position of the groom . lie has not only to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also to have a sufficient reserve to meet the expenses incident to establishing a new home and supporting his family . No one should accompany the bridal couple under any conditions . The presence of a third person , no matter how loving and considerate , is sufficient to bring about a state of frustration in both bride and groom . It may easily become a source of serious quarrels . Relatives and friends should not " surprise " the bride and groom with visits during the honeymoon for the same reason . To go where there are a number of friends who will entertain for the couple is equally unfortunate and again for the same reason . The purpose of the honeymoon is to provide a period of adjustment to marriage and not to provide an occasion for further entertainment and further follow-up by the family . The simpler the honeymoon , the more provision should be made for many activities of an interesting sort in which the couple may engage . Anyone who has had a long train trip ? say , three days ? with a good friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first day was interesting enough but that by the end of the third day the friendship was strained or even terminated . No doubt married couples think they wish to see each other all day long without any special activities planned , but this is far from the case . No one is fascinating enough to provide a source of stimulation and interest for twenty-four hours a day for ten consecutive days . Camping trips on which the couple constantly need to adjust to a changing environment , motor trips which are not too long and too wearing , places where there are sports in which the couple are mutually interested , or a city with motion pictures , theaters , museums , and parks , if the couple have sufficient funds to finance the expenses , are all good choices . Long train trips are not . During the honeymoon certain psychological states will be present of which it is well to take account . They should be met before they produce lasting conflicts . Strain has pointed out that these are ( 1 ) the desire to tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a willingness to promise anything , ( 3 ) a desire to possess completely . Each of these must be watched carefully . I t is always interesting to talk about one 's self , and this is usually more corn-  | mon in brides than in grooms . Nothing is more boring than a person about whom one knows everything . While the bride and groom know each other very well , or they should not have been married , some things should be left for them to discover about each other for many years to come . If the material talked about is in the nature of a too full confession , it is likely to produce shock effects from which they may not recover . If the couple are adult , and they should be , then each has fallen in love with someone else before the final engagement and marriage . Unless what has occurred during the preceding experience is of so serious a nature that it should have been told before marriage , then to give names , places , dates , and " the blow-by-blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously involved is simply to make clear and vivid images in the mind of the confessee which may interfere with all later marital adjustments . If a couple who have been happily married fifteen years or more arc asked if they had ever been in love with anyone other than the wife or husband , the answer will be that they fell in love only once and were never in the least interested in anyone other than the person to whom they are now married . All previous experiences are forgotten rapidly unless they are told in detail . If they are so told the partner in marriage will not let them be forgotten and they become inhibitory in their effects . If the honeymoon is not satisfactory to the bride a number of things may happen . All girls carry into marriage a species of imaginary playmate whom they bring out for their own satisfaction whenever life is not sufficiently interesting or rewarding . For brevity 's sake this imaginary playmate may be called " the fantasy lover . " The fantasy lover is usually someone whom the girl might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tells herself that life would have been entirely different had he been her choice for a life mate . If the honeymoon is dull he may be brought out at once , and in the process of telling her husband everything she may make the imaginary playmate too real and too vivid to herself and to him . Even if he is never discussed with her husband she may make her adjustment to the imaginary lover rather than to her husband and never thereafter adjust to married life . Most marriages are made permanent or lost in the first two or three months . Many are lost through the failure of the honeymoon to satisfy psychological and physical needs . Brides should recognize the presence of the imaginary lover as a fantasy . Husbands should never be made aware of the device which their wives are using for an escape from dullness and frustration .  | The second attitude , a willingness to promise anything , should also be watched . No promise of any kind should be made during the engagement period or the honeymoon unless it can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married couples lose confidence in each other ; for if promises are made and then not kept the marriage partner feels his mate to be untruthful and unreliable , two conditions on the basis of which no good marriage can be set up . Complete possession is frustrating to both . All adults need a sense of freedom , but not too much freedom . They wish to be loved , cherished , and needed , but also to feel that they can function in the normal life pattern without being pulled back by strings . This is somewhat more true of men than of women . The young man who told his wife that she might bow to any man that she had known before her marriage but that she was not to stop to speak to him on the street or to let him buy her an ice-cream soda is a case in point . The girl who continued to accept luncheon dates when her husband was busy and dinner dates when he was out of town was misusing any freedom which her husband had allowed her and should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still worse was the girl who while still on her honeymoon insisted on having time to write to the men who had rushed her before marriage . Finally the honeymoon may simply be dull . All marriages are characterized by periods which in a learning curve would be called plateaus ; namely , periods which are somewhat dull and boring and in which the marriage seems to have come to a standstill . The first of these may occur during the honeymoon , which is much earlier than they tend to appear in an average marriage . A bride and groom who have some months of adjustment behind them do not find it difficult to pass through a plateau when it occurs . There is no such background of the habit patterns required in normal living to help the honeymooning bride and groom through a period of dullness and frustration . If there is the least chance of a plateau occurring it is far better for the bride and groom not to take a trip but to move into their new home and spend their time together making it ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is not time enough for a plateau to develop . Any disagreements which they might have as to where articles shall be placed and who shall plan what arrangement of which room are forgotten in the first rush of affection and in the joy of being together .  | It should be made clear that large issues arc not the ones which often cause the most serious difficulty . It is the sudden quarrel about unimportant matters , followed by a series of such quarrels , which make the marital adjustment poor . A recent bride reported to me that the first quarrel with her husband was about picking wild flowers . After that he and she avoided all quarrels with excellent techniques . Every quarrel results in pain . Pain inhibits the setting up of habits which make being together enjoyable , just as it inhibits the setting up of all other habits . Every quarrel sets a brick in the wall between the people who engage in it . Every quarrel produces blocking and frustration . It also makes the person with whom one quarrels a stimulus to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The age for quarreling is nine to eleven , not adulthood . It is to be hoped that such disagreements as exist will be met by other techniques , and the honeymoon is the time to establish these . A busy , active , constructive honeymoon which results in joy in companionship and constructive work and thinking together sends the marriage more happily and more permanently on its way . The sooner the couple adjust to the circumstances which are to surround their first year or more of married life , the more stable the foundation for permanent adjustment .

Marriage provides security in personal relations . It provides social status , a base from which to operate in activities outside the home , a place to go for care when sick , for rest and relaxation when well , and for love and companionship and affection . And it is also a place where a lot of necessary work gets done . On the economic side the family provides for the wants of its members . While of necessity the members of a family group sacrifice some personal freedom for emotional and economic security , at the same time they gain a significant degree of independence of markets and money income by pooling their money and skills and personal possessions and doing for each other many things for which single persons must pay . Everyone knows that it is impossible for two persons to live more cheaply than one . But it is entirely possible for two people to live together for a much smaller money outlay than they must spend if they live apart . How much better the members of a family will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage the family 's resources . THE FAMILY 'S RESOURCES The resources of the family consist of the family 's money income from employment and from investments , the skills , abilities , time and energy of its members , equipment and personal possessions which it has available for use in supplementing its purchases in the market , and the community re , sources available for the use of families of its type .  | In taking stock of their resources , families think first of their money income . This is important , but it is also important to remember that money incomes generally are much smaller than most people think . Even in 1946 , when the national income for the first time passed $16o ; 000,000,000 , the majority of families in the United States had incomes between $1,500 and $5,000 . In 1946 , $4,000 was the average family income , and at any time three quarters of the families in this country have less than the average family income . In 1946 half of the families in the United States had less than $2,750 . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At the same time at least half the families in the United States own their own homes free and clear or have a substantial equity in them . Two thirds of the families in the United States own automobiles . There are more radios in use than there are families , though there may be a few families without one . Probably three quarters of the families own at least part of their furniture and a substantial amount of household equipment . Every family has some sort of clothing inventory . Every member of every family has a more or less extensive list of personal possessions . A substantial proportion of families , even in the lower-income groups , have some small income from investments , if nothing more than a few war bonds . At least half , and perhaps more , of the gainfully employed are or are becoming eligible for some sort of social-security benefits . There are few if any families that do not make some use of community resources ? schools , churches , parks , highways , police and fire protection , health services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for servicemen by the Veterans ' Administration . Thus resources of the family include much more than the family 's money income , though in a market economy such as ours a minimum of money income is fundamental . There is plenty of evidence that successful and happy family living is possible at every income level , except possibly the very lowest , and that too much money , instead of making successful marriage easier , often makes it more difficult . The fundamental problem in family management and finance is to make the best possible use not only of the family 's money income but of the time and energy and skills of the family members , of their possessions , and of available community resources . Front the point of view of the individual family , the best possible use is that which will enable the members of the family to satisfy as many as possible of their most important wants .  | THE FAMILY 'S WANTS The family 's wants may be listed in general terms . Every family wants food , warmth , clothing and shelter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health , education , and recreation . In addition to these wants , which are satisfied for the most part with material goods , are a number of intangible but equally important wants : security , independence , companionship and affection , social position , the respect of others and self-respect , and even a bit of adventure now and then . In the satisfaction of wants the material and the immaterial aspects can not be separated . Some social prestige comes from being able to order an expensive steak in a crowded butcher shop . In a time of housing shortage homeownership gives a much-wanted sense of security . Ownership of an automobile gives freedom of movement . For some people the knowledge that they are well dressed gives a sense of personal security fully as important to them as the respect of others which their clothing commands . Even the affectional side of family living has its economic aspects . Personal relations within the family are often improved if the husband brings home a box of candy now and then or an extra pair of nylons . Flowers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are supposed to be primarily concerned with keeping down expenses appreciate a good-looking new shirt or a new cigarette lighter if it is purchased with money the wife has saved from her share of the family money . There are three general ways in which families may provide the goods needed to satisfy the wants of their members . They may purchase what they want in the market , they may produce them for their own use , * or they may use the facilities , both governmental and non-governmental , which are available in their community . There is no one way in which all families satisfy any one want . Most families get their own meals , but many families buy their meals outside the home , and most families eat out at least oc*At the present time , most families ? urban families even more than farm families ? spend more time in supplementing their purchases with goods and services which they produce for themselves than they spend in earning money income .

They are limited in their homeproduction activities to production for family use .

Women buy much of theirs , though if they like to sew , or are hard to fit with the current styles , or want better clothing than they can afford to buy ready-made , they may make a good deal of their own clothing . Some families buy the children 's clothing as a matter of course , while others are equally matter-of-fact about doing most of the sewing for their children . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious groups prefer parochial to public education ; in some communities excellent private schools do a flourishing business . In metropolitan areas most families live in rented apartments . In smaller communities a substantial majority own their own homes . Similarly , in smaller communities probably three quarters of the families have at least one family car . In the larger metropolitan centers ( with the possible exception of Detroit and Los Angeles ) only from one third to one half have automobiles , and even the car-owning families depend to a large extent on public transportation . The quality of living which a family enjoys depends in part on the number of wants satisfied , in part on the ways in which those wants are satisfied , and in part on the balance maintained between different types of wants . Because of the diversity in individual family situations there can be no one best way for all families to work out their problems of management and finance . Instead there are many right ways , and there are also many wrong ways . Each family , therefore , must work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due regard for the physical and social environment in which its members live , for the resources which the family has available , for the work which its members are called upon to do , and for the special needs and interests of all the family members . WHO DOES WHAT In managing family affairs there is no longer any traditional division of men 's work and women 's work . World War I , the depression of the 1930 's , and more recently World War II have ended the tradition , so far as America is concerned , that the place of women is in the home . If a woman can contribute more to the family by working at home , that is her place . If she can contribute more by working outside and adding to the family 's money income , that is what she should do . However , if wives are to help by working outside for money , husbands can expect to help with the work of the family at home . The eight-hour day and the forty-hour week have left the husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which his wife did of necessity when her husband was employed from seven in the morning till six at night every day in the week . In the 1920 's it was taken for granted that the husband would earn the money and his wife would spend most of it . Now he has time to help with the spending . Especially at the super-markets men go along to help carry home the week 's groceries . During the war , when husbands were away in the service , wives took over the complete management of the family affairs , including such activities as the payment of taxes and insurance , the supervision of repairs to the house , and the upkeep of the family car . The problem of management , therefore , is no longer a simple problem of automatic division into men 's work and women 's work . Instead each family is free to work out for itself the division of work and of management which makes most effective use of the abilities and connections of both the husband and the wife . As the children become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibilities . There are a number of typical work-and-management patterns . A family can select the one best suited to its immediate situation and adapt it to its immediate needs , modifying it from time to time to suit changing conditions . For example : If both husband and wife are employed , both will be helping to earn the money income , both will share in the spending , and both should share in the other work of the household . If the husband only is gainfully employed , the wife will assume a larger responsibility for the work of the household , for much more of the routine planning and management , but she will plan some work and some purchasing for him to do , selecting the sort of thing that he can do best . If the husband is a business executive or a professional man whose work makes heavy demands on his time or takes him often away from home , it may be wise for the wife to take over almost completely the management of family affairs , even if she has to hire some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchasing and management . This will leave him only the responsibility of the family 's investments and insurance and taxes , which he can handle along with his business or professional activities . There are similarly a number of ways in which to divide the detailed work and management of the family . One frequently used is for the wife to plan the meals and purchase and prepare the food , shop for her own and the children 's clothes , and take care of the details of day-to-day household operation , while her husband sees that the rent is paid , or that the payments  | are made on the house , and that taxes are paid and the home kept in repair . Usually the husband sees to the upkeep of the car and to the heavy work around the yard , though if his wife likes to work outdoors she may take over the care of the flowers and the kitchen garden . The husband usually manages the family 's savings and investments , though if his wife has good business judgment he may consult her about individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any articles in which his business connections give him special advantages . If his wife has better money sense than he does and is a good shopper , he may turn over most of the buying to her and put in his time doing more work around the house . Many families find that it works better to change their division of work from time to time . When the children are small it may be wise for the husband to take over some of the buying and some of the heavier work which his wife did earlier in their married life . Or his wife may prefer to have him take over the care of the children when he is at home and leave her free to get out of the house and do the shopping . In any case , it is important that each family work out either formally or informally a clearly understood and definite plan for the handling of family affairs . So far as possible it is desirable for each of the members of the family to do what he or she can do and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothly if each member of the family keeps the other informed as to what he is doing and participates in current planning . Usually formal planning sessions are not necessary , though it often helps to sit down and talk over some particular problem . Members even of fairly large families usually know each other well enough so that in their planning they can take each other 's preferences into account without formal votes or majority decisions . In fact , some formal family councils which are dominated by one or two strong personalities are actually less democratic in their processes than less formal planning procedures . TECHNIQUES OF FINANCIAL PLANNING Many families find that financial planning is one of their most difficult problems . The first step in working out a spending plan for a family is to snake a rough plan in general terms , so much for food , so much for clothing , so much for shelter , so much for the family car , and so on , in order to get an idea of what can and what can not be done with the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family should plan in terms of take-home pay rather than in terms of income before taxes and other  | deductions . If the family has any considerable amount of business or investment income it must be sure to make adequate allowance for taxes . Some families like to make a preliminary plan by setting aside a given percentage of the family 's income for each of the major divisions of family expenditure . Others find they get a better idea of what they can do with their money if they make their preliminary estimates in dollars and then see what the available dollars will buy . When the members of the family have a general idea of what can and what can not be done with the family 's income they should work out a detailed spending plan . Since there are a number of expenditures which must be made once a month , many families prefer to work out in detail each month 's expenditures . Others prefer to plan the use of their money from payday to payday , as they expect to receive it , planning exactly how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spending plan , a family must provide for both expenditures , like food and rent and utilities , which must be made each week or each month , and for expenditures which come at longer intervals , like insurance , taxes , vacations , the license for the car , and the winter 's coal . Some families include these occasional expenditures as an integral part of their detailed spending plan , adding them in the months in which they must be met . Other families prefer to make a separate plan for these larger occasional expenditures , setting aside each payday in a special account enough to cover them . Time is required to make a comprehensive , realistic , and workable spending plan . It can not be done in an hour between the supper dishes and the evening movies . The things for which a family must spend its money are so many and varied that it seems almost impossible to make a plan without overlooking something . But by working out the plan a little at a time , first planning in detail for expenditures for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ; then putting the parts of the plan together and finally checking to be sure that there will be money available to make each expenditure when it must be made , any family that can add and subtract can make a usable plan which will enable its members to get more for their money than would be possible with unplanned spending . FOOD For most families food is the largest single item of expenditure . The family 's food should be nutritively adequate , though not necessarily elaborate  | or expensive . In the last few years information about nutrition has become available in simple graphic form . By observing a few simple , easy rules one can plan a nutritively adequate diet for a family and at the same time make plenty of allowance for reasonable food preferences . People can have a nutritively good diet at every income level except the very lowest , although there will always be a few families , even in the upper-income groups , who spend generously for elaborate but nutritively inadequate diets . Although it is not necessary to spend large amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend more for food than families of the same size with smaller incomes , but their food expenditures usually take a smaller percentage of the family income . Large families in any given income group usually spend more for food than do small families , but they spend less per person . The best way to estimate the amount that a family should spend for food is to plan in terms of so many cents per person per day , rather than in terms of a given percentage of the family income . In 1935-36 , 40 cents per person per day was the national average . In 1946 ? 47 , food costs were approximately double what they were in 1935-36 . On that basis a family of four persons in 1946 ? 47 would be doing a good job of feeding the family if they are spending not more than 8o cents per person per day , or $22.40 a week , or $g6 a month . A family of two may find it necessary to spend from 10 to 20 cents per person more than the average , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger family , of five or six or more , may be able to save from Io to 20 per cent over a family of four . Any family can cut its food costs materially by spending time to save money . It can cut from to to 20 per cent and sometimes more from the cash outlay required to provide the family with food by careful buying in self-service super-markets instead of full-service stores , by buying raw materials and preparing food , baking bread and cakes and pastries , by cooking potatoes , beans , turnips , and cabbage instead of opening cans , by buying low-cost stews and roasts instead of minute steaks and chops , and by growing a garden and doing the family 's canning . CLOTHING The provision of clothing for the family involves the purchase of three types of items , those like shirts , ties , and hose , which must be purchased more or less regularly throughout the year , a group of seasonal items which must be purchased in the fall , winter , spring , and summer , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suits ? which must be purchased only once in two or three years . Studies of family expenditures indicate that for any group of families at almost any income level the proportion of the family income spent for clothing is surprisingly uniform . In 1935 and 1936 , families the country over averaged I o per cent of their income for clothing . Families in the larger cities spent slightly more . Families in the rural areas spent slightly less . These percentages held true for the most part regardless of the size of the family . But while the average expenditures were uniform , variation from the averages on the part of individual families was greater than in almost any other item of family expenditure . In any year in which a family must buy a number of expensive garments its expenditures for clothing will run much above the average . In years when the family is using garments bought a year or more before the current outlay for clothing will be less than the average . How the family 's clothing expenditures are divided among the different members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in part upon the occupation of the husband , in part on whether or not the wife is working outside the home , and in part on the number and age of the children . Usually when the children are small parents spend more money for their own clothes than they do for the children 's , but when the boys and girls are in high school and college , usually the family spends more for the daughter than for her mother , and more for the son than for his father . For this is a time in the life of the young people when it is highly important for them to feel well dressed . There are a number of ways in which to plan for clothing expenditures . Some families prefer to make the bulk of their clothing purchases at two or three times during the year , buying a complete outfit of spring clothing just before Easter , some summer things early in June , and their fall clothing in September or October . Other families plan to buy a few new things at the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till the end-of-season sales . The family with a regular income frequently finds it easier to spread clothing expenditures along through the year . The family with irregular income may find it easier to outfit the family completely when they have the money available . There are definite advantages to planning clothing expenditures for two or three years at a time . A family can even cut its clothing expenditures by planning to purchase expensive articles for the husband one year and for  | the wife the next . Except for the periods when the children are growing rapidly , it is also possible to do the same thing for them , selecting garments which are large enough and of good enough quality to last for two years . Families purchase a number of garments with the intention of using them for several years . Most women buy street dresses with the idea of wearing them at least two years . Fully as many plan to use them for three yours as plan to discard them at the end of one year . This does not mean that they do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new dress every spring or fall , and they also have a last year 's dress to wear shopping and perhaps a dress two years old to wear to the market on rainy days . Similarly there are some indications that men average three quarters of a suit a year . That means they buy a suit every year for three years . The fourth year they buy an overcoat or a topcoat instead . Thus they usually have two or three wearable suits hanging in the closet . There are a number of ways to keep down the outlay for clothing . Clothing should be bought with the length of time it is to be used definitely in mind . By spending a fifth or a quarter more for a better quality of garment it is possible to get one which will wear twice as long , but if the garment is needed only for a single season it is usually cheaper to buy a quality which will be worn out when it is to be discarded . Substantial savings are possible by buying out of season those articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to save by buying one article which can be put to a number of uses , or a few articles which can be combined in a number of ways , rather than by duplicating complete outfits . In families with children , clothing can be passed from one to another , redesigning the garments when necessary . The cost of clothing can be cut substantially by buying materials and making the garments , since materials usually cost only one third to one half as much as finished garments of similar quality . HOUSING The type of housing a family selects should depend largely on what the family wants to do at home . In the middle forties families have had little choice . They have had to take what was available in the community and adjust their manner of living to the kind of shelter they could obtain . In ordinary times , however , it is usually possible to choose both the type of shelter and the way to pay for it . If both the husband and wife are employed they may prefer a small , conveniently located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work . If only the husband is employed  | the family may prefer a larger house in which the wife can do more for her family . A young couple with small capital may start housekeeping in a couple of light-house keeping rooms or in a small rented apartment . Then when they have had time to save a little money they can buy some furniture and move to a somewhat larger unfurnished apartment . If they plan to locate permanently in the community they may use part of their savings for furniture and part for a down payment on a house , and use the money they would otherwise save to complete the payments on their home . The family 's choice of a home determines not only the amount which must be paid for the house itself but a number of other expenses as well . If the family rents a completely furnished , heated apartment , the rent includes the payment for fuel , utilities , and the upkeep of the furniture . If it rents an unfurnished house , the type of house , its construction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount the family must pay for fuel and utilities . The size , design , and construction of the house determine the amount of work necessary to keep it clean , in good order , and in good repair. - j-  The location of the house determines the amount and type of transportation the family must use and the amount the family will have to pay for transportation to and from work , to stores , to church and school . It is impossible to make any exact statement about the amount a family should spend for shelter . Usually in the income groups under $5,000 or $6,000 , families with small incomes must spend a larger proportion of their income for shelter than do families with the larger incomes . Larger families usually spend a somewhat smaller proportion of their incomes for shelter than do smaller families , though frequently they get as much or more space per person by living in the older , larger houses . Families in large cities usually spend more for shelter and get less for their money than do families living in smaller communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 20 or 25 per cent of its income for the rent of an unfurnished house . A family living in an apartment with everything furnished can expect to pay 35 or 40 per cent f A large house does not always require more housekeeping than a small one . For in a small house , if the space provided is not quite adequate for all the different things the numbers of the family do , frequent getting out and putting away of equipment is necessary , while in a large house , with separate space for different activities ? a sewing room , a laundry , a rumpus room , and the like ? it is possible to walk out and close the door for a time on partially finished tasks .  | of its income for accommodations of similar quality . If the family plans to own a car it should keep payments for shelter to not more than one sixth of its income . A family ordinarily should not buy a house which costs more than twice its annual income , or three times its present income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period it is planning to live in the house . If a family is paying for its home on the installment plan it must be sure that the payments on the house and provision for taxes , repairs , and insurance do not add up to more than the family is able to pay for rent and set aside regularly for savings . In deciding whether to rent or buy a home a family must consider the advantages and disadvantages of each method of payment for shelter . Ordinarily , if , over a period of years , the family rents the same kind of shelter it would be willing to own , there is not much difference in the cost . For while the home-owning family does not have to pay rent every month , it must pay taxes , make needed repairs , and either invest substantial amounts from time to time in modernization and improvement or take a substantial loss in the value of its property from depreciation and obsolescence over a number of years . And it must count as part of the cost of owning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the home would earn if invested in securities . When it buys a home the family determines once for all the type , the size , and the cost of its home . The type of shelter can not be easily adjusted to changes in the family 's shelter needs . The family is protected against increases in shelter costs which come with increases in property values , except in so far as these increases affect the cost of repairs and taxes . The cost of the family 's housing can be reduced only by sale . Once its home is paid for , however , the family has more flexibility in making expenditures for shelter , for when it is necessary to keep expenditures to a minimum it can postpone improvements and reduce its current outlay to no more than the payment of taxes , insurance , and a minimum of absolutely necessary repairs . The family that rents its home must make regular payments every month . By moving from time to time it can adapt its shelter to changing family needs and to changes in the family income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during periods of rising prices and housing shortages . It can adjust its expenditures for shelter downward when prices or incomes decline . The family that buys its home on the installment plan has some of the advantages of owning and some of the disadvantages of renting . There is no landlord to raise the rent , but the family must make the payments on the  | property regularly or lose not only a place to live but a substantial part of what it has already paid as well . And it must remember that it has no landlord to make repairs and pay the taxes . It must plan for larger cash outlays while paying for the home than when renting , for it must pay not only the current cost of its shelter but make payments on the principal as well . THE FAMILY AUTOMOBILE For the two thirds of the American families that own one , the family car represents a fourth major expenditure . Before the war car-owning families with incomes up to $5,000 or $6,000 spent on the average from i o to 15 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that buy a new car every year usually spend from 12 to 15 per cent of their income each year . Families that buy a new car only once in four or five years spend as much as 20 or 25 per cent of their income for a car the year they purchase a new one , but as little as 5 per cent for upkeep and operation the years they " make the old car do . " When a family owns a car there are two types of costs to be met ? costs of ownership and costs of operation . Ownership costs continue as long as a family owns a car , whether the family uses it or not . Ordinarily an automobile depreciates in value almost as much if it is not driven at all as if it is driven any reasonable amount . Garage and parking space must be provided . Insurance costs are based on the value of the car and where it is garaged , rather than on the miles it is driven . License and taxes must be paid each year . Operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for repairs and servicing depend on how much the car is driven and under what sort of road and weather conditions . Ownership costs are determined when the family buys a car . Operating costs depend on how much the car is used . The more a family drives in a year , the larger will be its total expenditure for the automobile , but the lower will be the cost per mile . In deciding whether to buy a car , the family must consider the total cost of owning and operating the car . In deciding whether or not to take a particular trip , it needs to consider only the additional cost of the particular use , since the overhead cost of ownership goes on whether the car is used or not . It costs more to own a new car and more to operate an old one . When new cars are available at moderate prices it may cost less to trade in an old ear for a new one every year or two than to buy new tires and pay for  | a motor overhaul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in price it may cost less to drive the old car another year or two and pay the extra operating costs . If some of the members of the family can do most of the work on the car the family can get satisfactory transportation at low cost by buying an older car and doing the repair work necessary to keep it in good running order . If the family must pay for all the servicing a newer car may in the course of a year or two actually cost less money . In deciding whether or not to own a car , a family should consider not only what the car will cost , but what will be the effect of car ownership on other family expenditures . Owning a car may make it possible for the family to live in a less expensive neighborhood and to trade in low-service stores and super-markets . Sometimes the head of the family can get a better job than would be possible without the car . Owning a car may , however , make the family want to go about more and spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The decision , therefore , should be based first on the relative cost of living with and without an automobile , and second , on whether the more expensive way of living is worth the extra cost . HEALTH Adequate provision for the health of the family involves two types of expenditure ? more or less regularly recurring expenditures for minor illness and preventive medical and dental care , and occasional heavy expenses for incapacitating accidents and serious illness which may require hospitalization and surgery or long-continued medical treatment . These occasional heavy expenses are often accompanied by loss of income if the husband is incapacitated , or by extra expenses for additional service if the wife is unable for some time to do her usual work about the house . The cost of routine care varies from family to family , depending on the size of the family , the ages of its members , their general level of health , any special physical handicaps which may be present , and the types and cost of medical care available in the community . On the basis of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of routine care , but it is impossible to anticipate either when there will be heavy expenditures for incapacitating accidents or serious illness , or how much the necessary medical and surgical care will cost . The members of some families seem to have low resistance to disease . Some people work in occupations in which there is more exposure to accidents and illness . Other families seem to be lucky and avoid serious ac-  | cidents , or have a higher level of health . Often , however , this higher health level is due at least in part to preventive measures . Many families save money in the long run by spending money for regular physical checkups , for the correction of minor difficulties before they become serious , and by the observance of reasonable rules of hygiene . Often the expenditures for medical care may be reduced materially by being sure to provide the family with proper food , comfortable clothing , adequate shelter , and suitable recreation . Families find that their expenditures for health vary widely from year to year . In the nineteen-twenties , 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90 per cent of the total cost of medical care , while the other 6o per cent made only Io per cent of the expenditures . A family can provide in advance for a substantial part of the cost of a serious illness or accident by carrying insurance to cover the cost of hospitalization and surgical care . Families can carry health and accident insurance which will provide them with a minimum of income during most of the disability of the wage earner . Insurance can , however , cover only part of the cost . An insurance company will not knowingly provide health and accident insurance paying more than 8o per cent of a person 's regular income . Most policies provide for at least a seven-day waiting period before payments begin . In order to keep the cost of hospital insurance within what most families can pay , the number of days of hospital care provided in any one year is limited to what most families find adequate . Insurance for the cost of medical attention is still experimental . While families find that hospital insurance helps in meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide for a substantial part of the cost out of savings or , if their savings are inadequate , to arrange for credit , and adjust their other expenditures so that they can gradually pay the balance of the cost . There are two types of hospital insurance now available . One type pays a stated amount per day for each day that an insured member of the family is confined to the hospital . The family pays the hospital bill and is reimbursed by the insurance company when it presents evidence of hospitalization . This type of insurance provides a given number of dollars to apply on the cost of hospital care . The insurance company pays a stated amount per day , regardless of how much the hospital facilities cost . If the patient uses a ward bed which costs less than the per diem payment , the family has the difference to apply on other costs . If the bed costs more , the family pays the difference . The other type of insurance provides a stated amount of a given type of  | hospital care . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is due under the provisions of the policy , and bills the patient for any services not covered by insurance . The cost of hospital insurance usually varies with the amount of coverage it provides and whether the insurance is purchased on an individual or a group basis . Usually it is easier for the head of a family to qualify for hospital insurance as a member of a group . Under a group plan he can usually get a given amount of protection at substantially lower cost . A number of industrial group plans now written include provision for continuing the insurance on an individual basis at somewhat higher cost if the head of the family changes his employment . In any case , it is important to learn exactly what any given insurance plan does and does not cover and to observe the terms of the policy carefully so that you will be sure not to be left without insurance when protection is most needed . RECREATION Recreation is an item for which it is possible to spend almost any amount of money . Some recreational expenditures are expenditures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports equipment , memberships in country clubs ? while others take the form of additional expenditures for food , clothing , car operation , extra current for the radio , or extras on the grocery bill , like candy and cigarettes . Recreation is capable of greater elaboration than almost any other type of expenditure . At the same time , by care in planning , it is possible , by the expenditure of some time and energy and thought , to have a good time with little if any cash outlay . The family which must keep expenditures to the minimum may entertain simply at home instead of inviting friends to theater or restaurant or night club . If food is indicated they may select meals which do not call for much food , like Sunday-night suppers . In returning dinner invitations they may serve inexpensive but interesting meals , perhaps with a few extra trimmings , placing the emphasis on attractiveness rather than elaborateness of serving , and on the taste rather than the expensiveness of the food . Much can be added to the significance of anniversaries by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the gift of personal items that would be bought sooner or later but which give added pleasure because they are constant reminders of important days . Even when a family must keep its money outlay at a minimum it must not neglect adequate provision for suitable recreation , for recreation is an  | important clement in maintaining the family 's physical and mental health . If the members of the family have plenty of time and energy at their disposal they can concentrate on the type of activities that require time and effort but little outlay of money . If the family is using all the energy it can safely spend on necessary work its recreation program should provide a maximum amount of relaxation with a minimum expenditure of time and energy , using whatever money the family can afford . The family should plan its recreation with all its other activities in mind . If the husband is meeting people all day long his recreation may well take the form of quiet evenings reading or listening to the radio . If he is seated at a desk all day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf , bowling , or tennis , or by working in his garden or at some physically releasing type of hobby . If the wife is kept rather closely at home most of the time her husband should take her out to dinner and the theater occasionally . If both husband and wife are employed and are often away from home they may get the variety they need by entertaining their friends at home . The family 's recreation program should not use money which the family can not afford . But it should provide the release from the current strains of daily living which is necessary to keep the members of the family in good physical and mental health . PLANNING FOR THE LONG LIFE OF THE FAMILY If a family is to use the resources at its disposal to provide the richest and most satisfying life for its members it should plan for each particular period in the life of the family with the whole life of the family clearly in mind . This is not so difficult a problem as at first it might seem , for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly defined stages ? marriage , the establishment of the family , the birth , schooling , adolescence , maturity , and departure of the children , a few quieter years in later middle life , old age , retirement , and death . Each of these stages brings with it characteristic needs and wants which make varying demands on the family 's current money income . The number of years an individual family spends in each of these stages varies somewhat with the age of the husband and wife at marriage , the number of their children , the intervals between the children 's births , and the amount of education with which the children are provided . Even families without children pass through a somewhat similar cycle , which makes chang-  | ing demands on their incomes as their interests grow and change with the passing years.t Similarly , the swing of the business cycle and other business changes bring changes in the family 's income and other resources . Changing business conditions affect the prices a family must pay and the income it receives . They affect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the market . They affect opportunities for employment of the family members and for the saving and investment of family funds . Changing business conditions affect the age at which marriage is economically feasible , the size of the family which it is wise to rear , the length of the effective earning period of the family members , and the age at which retirement is imperative or financially possible . Every family will live through several complete swings of business cycles , each one just a little different from all the others . Most families will experience at least one period of pronounced inflation and probably will live part of their lives during periods in which the long-time trend of prices is up and part in periods in which the long-time trend of prices is down . Because of these concurrent changes in the family life cycle and the business cycle , the family 's current income will not necessarily vary proportionately or even directly with the family 's changing needs . There may be a few families in which the husband 's earnings increase more rapidly during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the demands upon those earnings . But most families face years in which necessary expenses are larger than the family 's current income , years in which the family 's income is more than adequate for current needs , and years in which the family , by careful management , is able to live within its income with varying degrees of financial strain . The establishment of the family involves the investment of considerable money in furniture and other household equipment . This usually is not too difficult to manage , especially if both the husband and the wife are employed . The years in which the children are born bring new expenses at a time when the family must get along without the wife 's earnings . Usually the years when the children are in elementary school involve a minimum of financial strain . But during the peak of the life cycle , when the children are For childless families the necessity of providing for their old age entirely from their own invested savings takes the place of expenditures which other families make on their children . And families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend money for many interesting things with which to fill the time other families spend caring for and enjoying their children .  | in high school and college , only a few families are able to provide everything the members of the family need out of the husband 's earnings , or even out of the family 's current income , unless several members of the family contribute from their earnings . ADJUSTING TO CHANGING WANTS AND CHANGING INCOME There are a number of ways by which a family may adjust to the changing demands on its income . Usually at one time or another every family uses all of them . A family may plan in advance for large expenditures , spreading them along over a considerable period , seeing to it that not more than one or two must be made at the same time . This is what a family with a weekly pay check does with its larger monthly bills , when it pays the rent out of one week 's check , pays for the utilities out of another , stocks up with staple groceries with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's check for new clothes or for the payment on the family car . The principle is the same when the family is planning for larger occasional expenditures which are made only once in several years . No family in the lower or middle income groups is able to make more than one or two major expenditures out of any one year 's income . When the family buys a new car that is the one major expenditure for the year . Next year there will be money for a vacation trip . The year after that it will be possible to redecorate the living room and modernize the kitchen . And the next year the family will want to purchase another car . A family may provide itself with expensive durable goods by purchasing them in advance of the time they will be needed , when there are not many other demands on the family income . Many families buy and complete the payments on their home early in the life of the family , or buy a new car which they drive for five or six years while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may save money for specific expenditures which require a larger outlay than the family can make out of any one year 's income . Most families find that several years ' savings are necessary to provide for the children 's college education . Some families prefer to save their vacation money for two or three years and take an extensive trip rather than to have two or three inexpensive vacations nearer home . A family may want to make some large expenditure before it has had time to save all the necessary money . If it is sure that it can make the necessary payments it may decide to use its credit . Faced with the necessity of making  | extensive repairs on their car , a family may decide to turn in the old car and pay for a new one on the installment plan . If there is an acute shortage of furnished apartments a family may find it easier to get suitable shelter by renting an unfurnished house and using their credit to get the furniture they need . In using credit it is important to distinguish between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchases which , once they are paid for , will reduce the family 's current outlay . And since there is a great deal of difference in the terms on which credit is available , it is important to know what different kinds of credit cost and to use the type that will let the family buy on credit at the lowest additional cost . It is wise to use credit only when having something now rather than saving first and buying later is worth the additional cost of buying on credit . A family can reduce the demands on its money income by having the members of the family do more for themselves and by making more use of community resources that do not cost money . A family can cut its food costs by doing more baking and canning . It can cut its clothing costs by making and by making over more garments . It can cut its recreation costs by having good times at home and by using public parks and playgrounds , attending municipal concerts , or getting new books to read from the public library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and contingencies , like the loss of a job , the opportunity to move to a better job , a chance to make an unusually fortunate purchase or investment , accidents , or unexpected illness , a family can carry insurance of various kinds and can set up a cash reserve for contingencies . Ordinarily a family finds that it pays to carry insurance against the contingencies in which there is a small chance of a large loss , and to set up cash reserves to cover the contingencies for which the total amount of expenditure varies little from year to year . A family should never neglect to insure its home and furnishings and personal possessions against loss by fire . Usually it is wise to add the additional protection against windstorm and other types of damage which are included in what the insurance man calls " extended coverage . " Automobile insurance is a necessity . Coverage against loss from fire and theft is inexpensive . Property damage and public liability insurance is required in many states for the protection of others . Collision insurance is more expensive but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some thirty-five million people have found it pays to carry hospitalization insurance ; an increasing number of families are adding insurance  | to cover the cost of surgical care . But since bills for routine medical care do not vary much from year to year , most families prefer to pay their doctors ' and dentists ' bills direct , setting aside a little extra in savings in years when medical expenses are low to use in other years when the family has more than the usual amount of illness . Most families carry some life insurance on one member or more of the family , to provide funds for funeral expenses and something for the family to live on in case of the death of a family member . Every family needs a substantial cash reserve to draw on in case of any one of a number of contingencies . If possible , the family should have about the equivalent of six months ' income in a savings account or invested in government bonds or other easily marketable securities , where it can be got at on short notice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes . If the head of the family loses his job , his unemployment insurance will help to defray some of the family 's current expenses when he is not working , but savings are necessary to keep up payments on insurance , a home , the car , and other essential fixed charges . The fund may be drawn on to meet unusually heavy medical expenses . It may make it possible for the family to move to better employment , or to take advantage of an unusual opportunity to buy a new home , or new furniture . In case of serious damage to the automobile , it will provide funds with which to buy a new car . Contingent reserves are to be used . But when funds are withdrawn for these perfectly legitimate uses they should be replaced as soon as possible , so that they will be available for other contingencies . A WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT The management and financing of a family is not an unimportant job to be carried on in spare time . For the way a family manages its affairs has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the means at its disposal . Nor is it something to work too hard at . There is no value in management for its own sake . The test of success in family management is not the amount of money earned or saved or spent , nor the amount of work done by the members of the family , but rather the quality of living the family makes available for its members , not only this year , but every year throughout the whole long life of the family .  | Extramarital relations include any sexual relationship outside of marriage . Premarital relations may not involve the prospect of marriage ; they may involve only the intended spouse . I believe that larger numbers of young people of this generation are more free in sexual expression than they were a generation ago . However , our present methods of obtaining knowledge concerning the sexual experiences of young people compared with the little knowledge obtainable twenty-five years ago make comparison largely a matter of guesswork . A number of statements by competent investigators ' reveal that a relatively high percentage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding . Of the engaged couples coming to me in preparation for marriage I have found that between 65 and 7o per cent have been having intercourse , and in this I am not counting heavy petting or intimacies that fall just short of intercourse itself . A few years ago I had an opportunity to interview eighteen married women out of a group of twenty , all of whom were over forty-five years of age . I took advantage of this opportunity to ask each whether or not she had had sexual intercourse with her husband before marriage ; thirteen admitted that they had . This , together with a large number of older wives who during counseling have also made such an admission , makes ones speculate as to the actual sex practices of the previous generation . In a reply to sex questions during a psychiatric examination at Army induction centers two doctors ' report that out of a study of 4,600 cases of unmarried males between the ages of twenty-one and twenty-eight , 79.4 per cent had had sexual experience . Some 56 per cent of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " nice girls , " meaning by this a girl whom the man could introduce to his parents and would consider marrying . These psychiatrists make the observation that " intercourse with future spouses before marriage will become universal by 1950 or 1955 . " Were investigation possible , the results might reveal that having sexual intercourse with the intended spouse before marriage has been a practice for a much longer time and by much larger numbers than we have imagined . What has happened to bring about such a change ? It is reasonable to assume that there is no difference in the sexual natures of the young people today from those who preceded them . We will look at the changing customs for our reasons . A type of knowledge fairly widespread among the young today has greatly minimized three controlling fears of the past , the fear of detection , fear of infection , and fear of conception . Last but not least as a definitely controlling factor is the change in our attitude toward supervision of the young . Modern education , which teaches that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has pushed chaperonage to the background and to a large extent eliminated it as a social custom . Automobiles make it possible for young people to travel a great distance in a short time , and so the effectiveness of community supervision is eliminated . A great deal has already been said about drinking , trips to roadhouses and overnight cabins , and a lot of emphasis has been placed on the breakdown of religious controls . When considering promiscuous behavior or isolated episodes which have followed some drinking or party experience these are undoubtedly important factors , but this evidence is misleading in the total picture . For a large number of those who are intimate with their intended spouses their greatest protection against detection is their own impeccable behavior . Some admit to moderate drinking , many report that they do not drink at all , they do not visit roadhouses , they have never been in an overnight cabin , and seldom do they ever report the use of a hotel room . No , the locale more often reported than not is their own homes , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present-day attitude that chaperonage or parental supervision is considered unnecessary . Premarital relations are discussed in another chapter . The subject is introduced here only to show changing attitudes toward having sexual intercourse without legal or religious sanction . The sex life of the unmarried adult has always posed a social problem . While celibacy has been the expressed ideal , it has been recognized that this  | is difficult for many and impossible for some . Together with this there is considerable evidence that in striving for such an ideal the resulting nervous tensions , the fears and worries which are caused by lonesomeness or feelings of insecurity that are the natural corollaries of singleness combined with sex hunger put such persons in a state of readiness for sexual intimacy when the closeness of companionship tends to bring the erotic factor clearly into focus and the time and the place make capitulation easy . Most males beyond the age of thirty who are not married are single because they are the sole support of a dependent parent or have some form of family obligation or have been unreasonably long in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those males who reject marriage ; from lo to 15 per cent of males prefer bachelorhood , but preference for bachelorhood does not necessarily include a preference for celibacy . Whereas a few women may deliberately choose to remain unmarried , many of them are single because of such factors as a prolongation of their educational program , overprotective parents , lack of prospective males in their circle , family responsibilities , and a lack of sex drive during those years when an interest in mate selection should be paramount . Some men and women are , because of conditioning or otherwise , homosexual and thus find heterosexual relationships unattractive . Others in practice are bisexual and because of this are not inclined to tie themselves to a permanent relationship . Here also we must consider the single woman who has fallen in love with a married man and , having developed a romantic attachment for a man who is conventionally unobtainable , she prefers to enter into a sexual liaison with him rather than to give him up . The older a man gets beyond the age of thirty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of marriage . The woman never seems to give up hope . This may be accounted for in many ways . The need for emotional and physical security and the uncertainty concerning her vocational and social future concern her to a much greater degree than they do the man . Yearning as she does for a home and children and the love and protection of a mate , without them she pictures a dreary future and becomes increasingly anxious to avoid it . As her diminishing prospects of marriage are brought more sharply into focus she finds herself at the same time becoming more than ever conscious of her sexual needs . Personal counselors have for some time been aware of the fact that girls in their late adolescence and early twenties are apt to have much less desire for sexual intercourse than does the woman who is eight to ten years older . This fact is substantiated  | by the evidence that has been brought to our attention concerning the peak of male sexuality being reached somewhere between the sixteenth and twenty-second year and very slowly but steadily declining toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolves slowly and so much so that many of them are not aware of any particular drive until they are in their late twenties and early thirties . We are told that they will reach the peak of desire somewhere between their thirty-fifth and fortieth year . ' We can see from this that the man 's desire for a permanent sexual relationship may be decreasing at the very time when the woman 's is radically increased . This , then , together with the breakdown of social controls , helps to explain why there may be a considerable increase in the number of unmarried people who lay no claim to celibacy . We have to recognize that sex is an appetite that man is predisposed to satisfy , and the stronger the drive , the more insistently he strives to find a means of circumventing a convention which would prevent it . In the male this has always been recognized . While in precept we have rather feebly denounced it , in practice there has been social acceptance . The man will be blamed only if he is caught flagrante @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the woman 's behavior . Here again we are faced with the changing mores . The fears concerning conception , infection , and detection have been greatly reduced . The woman no longer has a fear of being ostracized if a decent regard for the proprieties is being observed . It is quite common for friends to dismiss their suspicions of what is going on with a shrug of the shoulders and a " none of my business " attitude . Security , a home of her own , children are much stronger motives in the woman than in the man . With all this she becomes acutely aware that , having passed her thirtieth year , her childbearing years are growing less ; while at the same time , whatever a particular male 's procreative ability may be and whether or not his chances of fathering children also diminish , certainly the average male does not think of this as a probability . All this , then , leads many a woman as she gets older to decide in desperation to get a man by hook or by crook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many of such sexual relationships are looked on by her not only as a means of emotional release but as a device leading to a permanent union . I have talked with many refined and educated young women in their late twenties and in their thirties who in reporting a liaison are so forlornly clinging to this lope that they arc placing reliance on tenuous promises despite their better judgment .  | There will always be sexual activity among the unmarried , but encouraging all this by a laissez-faire attitude is certainly not conducive to a strengthening of marriage and the home . STATISTICS There are few published surveys that make any pretense at giving statistical information concerning postmarital relationships . While there have been a number of published reports concerning premarital relationships and other types of sexual activity , any account concerning illicit behavior of married people is largely conspicuous by its absence . One of the leading and competent studies , that by Terman , ' frankly admits that there was no attempt to get at postmarital relationships because the author feared that in doing so he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , make a study of their desire for such experience . Dr. Hamilton , " in his studies of a selected group of one hundred married men and one hundred married women , reports that " twenty-eight men and twenty-four women had had illicit sexual intercourse while married to their spouses . " Dr. Katharine Davis ? sought to correlate opinion with practice and found in the matter of opinion that while about one fifth of the women agreed there were occasions when the wife might be justified a somewhat larger number sought to justify such an experience on the part of the husband . Then when measuring opinion against practice she found that many who accepted some justification had had no such actual experience in their own marriages , while a number of those whose opinions were negative reported that such experience had taken place . Any critical opinion from the standpoint of available data would at this time be of little value . At the same time it can be easily understood that in any statistical study it is far easier to get people to commit themselves about other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in marriage itself than it is to elicit information concerning their present unconventional behavior , especially where such behavior involves serious legal as well as social implications . If current literature reflects the times , certainly a number of popular authors who deal with social subjects make statements inferring that adultery today is the rule rather than the exception . One writer$ in particular , whose book is currently the vogue , takes this viewpoint . Undoubtedly these authors intend to awaken our people to what is going on around them and hope for a recrudescence of social conscience and individual responsibility , but one ca n't help wondering if it may not have the opposite effect , that of  | encouraging a person to excuse his own conduct in the flippant words , " Everybody 's doing it now . " In many of the question periods following my lectures , although this subject has not been a part of the discourse , I have had the question raised , " Is n't it true that a great many people have extramarital relations ? " A common question is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extramarital relations ? " Another question is , " What attitude is the wife to take when she finds her husband has been having relations with another woman ? " To consider , therefore , that this subject is of interest and of great concern to thousands of our population whose lives are definitely affected by this type of behavior is reasonable . Here is an excerpt from a ten-year report of our Service , 1934-44 , covering 1,834 individuals . Males , 33.9 per cent ; females , 66.1 per cent ; education : below secondary , 7.8 per cent ; having secondary , 30.5 per cent ; above secondary , 56.9 per cent ; not obtained , 4.8 per cent . About 20 per cent of the married couples who come to me for counseling report infidelity on the part of one or both partners , generally one , and generally the husband . I have had a number of cases , however , in which the wife was the offending partner . In some of these instances there was reported but a single episode of unfaithfulness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confined to one partner . Illicit experiences involving a married person incidentally revealed in a conversation on irrelevant matters ? for instance , an unmarried woman with a personal problem who reveals a relationship with a married man ? would not be included . The term unfaithfulness refers to sexual intercourse and does not include reported behavior that falls short of intercourse , such as flirtations , petting , or group behavior , such as nude bathing parties or strip poker . Again for emphasis let me repeat that this statement can not be used as a valid index for the general population . Most people who come to a counselor seek to preserve their marriages . Probably a far greater number of couples involved in infidelity are among those who want separation or divorce . Certainly records of divorce proceedings disclose infidelity as a major cause . In a study of this kind one becomes overwhelmed with all of the possible avenues of exploration . The personalities of the man , the wife , the paramour , their personal maladjustments with all the contingent factors , similarities and differences in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of religious conviction , parental and sibling affections and hostilities , happy  | or unhappy home life , vocational and social adjustments , all make such a complicated mosaic as to defy any breakdown into simple patterns for group study . We can not classify husbands and wives under specific reasons for illicit relations . No matter how hard we try we will always have to come back to a study of the individual case . This attitude is emphasized and confirmed by publication of results of the far-reaching studies in human sex behavior by Dr. Alfred Kinsey . Dr. Groves , in his book , ' differentiates between acute unfaithfulness and chronic unfaithfulness , defining the first as being an extramarital relationship which has happened but has not become a habit . To this I add a third classification , quondam unfaithfulness , referring to that situation where the illicit experience has been long past but recently disclosed . The marriages in which the problem is acute or quondam are the ones more likely to be seen by the marriage counselor . While in conference that which could be classified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although often the affair has been so discreetly carried on that the mate has no knowledge of it and consequently it has had little traumatic effect on the marriage itself . It is the single incident or occasionally repeated unfaithfulness or the discovery of an incident which has happened since marriage but now is long past that creates in the spouse a fear for the future , and as their love has not been entirely alienated they seek counsel in the hope that something may be done to save their marriage . The following are a few of the sociosexual behavior patterns disclosed in cases of unfaithfulness : Where the husband is the offending partner : r . He has marital as well as extramarital relations . z . He has extramarital relations with no marital relations . 3 . He has been unfaithful and yet considers his marriage a success . 4 . He complains that his wife 's lack of orgasm has made intercourse with her uninteresting . 5 . He reports interest in deviated methods of expression or in precoital preparation which are displeasing or uninteresting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis that he has a greater sexual need and capacity and that it would be unfair to the wife to expect her to submit to his frequency . 7 . He will complain that she faits to meet certain fetishistic needs of his : complete nudity , variety in coital positions , some sadomasochistic approach , oral stimulation ; he seeks a woman who shows reciprocal interests .  | Where the wife is the offending partner : 1 . Neglect of her sexual needs on the part of the husband . 2 . She complains of him as a lover ? he does n't show affection , does n't compliment her , is abrupt and inconsiderate in his sexual approach ? she complains of marriage monotony. 3 . She complains of lack of orgasm but feels the husband does little to help her to a climax . 4 . She is masochistic and longs for strong and aggressive action on the part of her husband ; he fails to comply . 5 . Occasionally the wife will report an illicit experience and yet report her marriage is a success . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as classifying cases is concerned . They are merely excerpts from the original complaint and tend to show that adultery is usually but a symptom of a deeper and more basic problem . Because of this it is extremely difficult to isolate this problem as a subject and to discuss it constructively . One immediately finds oneself tempted to get into personality problems and is immediately conscious of all the neurotic and psychiatric implications , the importance of background factors and family conflicts . This chapter does not include consideration of sociopathological problems in which a married person is involved in rape or pedophilia , nor does it include resort to the prostitute , nor homosexuality . I shall indulge in an oversimplification and for this purpose make the following assumptions : Assumption i . That in most well-adjusted marriages neither partner is in a state of readiness for illicit experience . Assumption 2 . That where a state of readiness exists there are both positive and negative factors operating for or against such an experience . Here is the age-old conflict between duty and desire . While duty sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of males who are not married and the number of unmarried females , most of whom would be if they could , plus a growing number of unhappy mates , one does n't have to go far for the opportunity . In fact , opportunity often comes knocking at the door in the form of a little subtle seduction and some that is not so subtle . The seducer , by the way , is not always the married one nor always the older . All that has previously been said about the sex life of the unmarried ( this includes the divorced and widowed ) becomes a part and parcel of this whole problem . One who is in a state of readiness for an illicit experience may find it  | difficult and may never surrender because of the conflict with his social and religious ideals , but if in doing this he becomes a martyr to righteousness , heaven help the family ! In justifying one 's behavior the human being 's ability to rationalize is so remarkable that there is no limit to the reasons given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : z . Sexual frustration ? difference in intensity of desire , difference in ability to respond , difference in individual love requisites ? impotence of husband , frigidity of wife , etc. 2 . Lack of ego satisfaction ? lack of prestige in the family , no build-up at home , being unfavorably compared to others , conflict with in-laws , inadequate income , etc. 3 . Propinquity ? there was the opportunity , the excuse ; it just happened . 4 . Pseudo-romantic love . Here I am not referring to the romantic idea on which the marriage may have been based and which has turned out to be a hoax , although this may be the case , but rather to the romantic idea which causes a man or woman to " fall in love with someone else " and thus implicitly out of love with the spouse . In three recent cases involving postmarital relations of the husband a composite statement would read something like this : " I loved my wife when 1 married her . We have been getting along very nicely . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a fine housekeeper and a wonderful mother , but I am in love with this other woman . I ca n't get her out of my mind . " All three of these husbands deny that their sexual relations with their wives have been satisfactory , but the three wives claim that for them the sex life was very satisfactory up to this time . The husbands are still living with their wives , and each reports that because of the counseling the wife has received she is a better sexual partner and that on the whole the domestic relations have improved , but the wife knows and I know that each is still carrying a torch for the paramour . How long the marriage can continue in this state is anybody 's guess . At the beginning each husband talked about divorce and the wife was appalled at the idea , but a woman who has done everything to co-operate and has inventoried her personality traits and tried to make adjustments and has become more active and responsive sexually reaches the limit of her endurance when she finds her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasantries and attentions , and sitting around the house with a bored expression or finding every possible excuse to go out on business .  | In these three cases each husband found something more than sexual satisfaction with the other woman , and it is this something to which he is tenaciously clinging . I refer to the many little things that are inflationary to his ego . She makes him feel important while his wife has taken him for granted . One thing all three of these men have in common is that each was brought up by a dominant and overprotective mother . In two of these cases the father was reported as lacking in aggressiveness ; in the third the father was dominant but in conflict with the mother . In business all three men were successful , but the history of each showed that he tended to withdraw from reality and flee from responsibility in any emotional crisis . If their marriages do not survive all three of these women are by now better prepared to meet the eventuality , and while their homes will become broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children toward the parents and between the father and mother will be fraught with much less tension than would otherwise be so , for there is such a thing as education for divorce . Where by deed or word the partner 's ego has been hurt it is much more difficult to effect a reconciliation than where the problem is merely that of a sexual experience outside of marriage . Running concurrently with the effort to prepare young people for marriage by providing courses and counseling on successful marriage and family living , there is a similar effort in the direction of re-educating those who have been off to a poor start or have already run into difficulties . This second effort , like the first , is already paying dividends . Hundreds of couples varying in ages from their early twenties to their late forties , but perhaps the largest group in the age range from twenty-five to thirty-five , are being helped every year by competent counselors to re-evaluate their problems in terms of a better understanding of each other 's personalities and needs , of understanding and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to realize that the more we put into a marriage the more we take out , and that spouses are , after all , only human beings with human frailties , and that marriage itself is no panacea for character defects or personality maladjustments . Where there is a will on the part of both there is a way to rebuild their marriage and make it a lasting and satisfactory experience . Adultery , like poverty , we have with us always , but he who helps a couple to make or maintain a happy marriage makes a direct contribution to a reduction of extramarital relations .  | NOTES ' Lewis Terman , Psychological Factors in Marital Happiness , 1938 , Chap . 12 ; Clifford R.

Where this is so these difficulties are readily over-come by reasonable educational procedures . A psychologically healthy person can learn about relationships in marriage as he can learn about any-thing else . At the other extreme are the more serious disturbances encoun-tered in marital life . Impotence caused by psychological factors , premature ejaculation , frigidity , and other serious interferences are problems that can-not be discussed in general terms . Such conditions require patient diagnosis and treatment by skilled psychiatrists in each case . Many marriages are difficult for one or both partners by virtue of certain lacks in personality development . These create problems that lie between the extremes that have been mentioned . The vicissitudes of these marriages are the subject of this section . Sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the partners , as judged by the maturity they have developed . As in other adult life relationships , sexual conduct and associa-tion are expressions of one 's understanding of his own role and of the meaning and role of his partner . In the course of development from infancy to adulthood a continuous series of changes and readjustments in personal relationships is made by every one . This series of changes is characterized by a process of separation from situations that have been secure and satisfying , and the entering into re-lationships in which some measure of the previous security must be relin-quished . Thus , the secure , intra-uterine position of the unborn child is  | disrupted by birth . He is thrust into an environment that makes new demands upon him . In turn , the nursing infant is soon weaned from breast or bottle and must eat in a more mature fashion . The preschool child must go to school , get along with a bit less of his mother 's protective care , and learn to take his place among a group . Similarly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relinquished for the more demanding world of active work in our society . Marriage can be regarded as the final step that brings one to the position of adult and parent , in which one is fully responsible for oneself and others . Each step in this development implies a readiness to meet a new situation that makes greater demand upon the more mature capacities of an individual than did the previous life period . This readiness involves an understanding of the situation to be met and an acceptance of the role to be played in the new situation as desirable . What has just been said places emphasis upon the necessity to emerge from attitudes of too great dependency in order to meet the demands of adult life . A corollary of the basic proposition involved is the necessity to achieve adult attitudes and capacity for relationships in the sexual field . Sexual reactions and the forms they evidence in adult life can not be separated from the history of the child 's emotional life and development . His sexual perspectives in adulthood reflect the history of his interpersonal relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial emotional attachment of any child is to the mother , the source of all comfort and security in infancy . All physical and emotional gratifications stem from the experience the child has in being tenderly cared for by her . The training he undergoes , in cleanliness , in habits of eating , sleeping , will color his earliest expectations of what is and is not permissible in life . This initial exclusive attachment to the mother is soon modified by the fact that a father begins to play a role in the child 's life , a complicating role . While the major relationship between a child and father is that of affection and warm regard , there are many diverse aspects of feeling that color the relationship at various age levels . Children consider the father 's presence , in some measure , as a threat to their own exclusive claims to the affection of the mother . Sometimes fathers feel the same way about the children . Fathers arc commonly reacted to as threatening ; they are big , overwhelming to a very small child , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward their fathers and inwardly tend to question very much the possibility that they will ever be able to attain his adult , masculine qualities . This competitive attitude of boys later continues to be expressed in the highly competitive relationships between growing boys . The boy who can outdistance , outfight , outswim his mates is accorded the primary position among them . When a father is able to relate himself to a small son in terms that mean to the boy that the father basically approves of him and accepts him , this tends to bring to the son the assurance that he is a potentially adequate and acceptable person . He can see the possibility that someday he may be a person like his father and expect to assume the responsibilities and prerogatives that go with masculine adulthood . Such a basic attitude is called identification with the father . This identification serves as a psychological platform on which the son may stand as he struggles through the various phases of his development through childhood and adolescence . On the basis of this identification he can project his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group alone in terms of eventual interests in a man 's work , a man 's social life , a man 's sexual life . A similar evolution occurs in the basic attitudes of girls . Girls must evolve through an even more complicated series of relationships , the normal end result of which is an identification with the role of the mother as a woman with a corresponding capacity to face a woman 's familial , social , and sexual role in life . The personalities and training attitudes of parents may facilitate the course of development or cause deviations or even serious disturbances in this development . A mother can be too protective , too possessive and encompassing , too directive and domineering to permit a son to develop the necessary certainty about his own masculine capacities . Or a father may be too intimidating , too unaccepting of the son 's potential masculinity to permit the boy the development of masculine attitudes and outlook . The result sometimes is , in less serious situations , a young man without sufficient independence of spirit and normal aggression . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for independence in work , social life , sexual life . The alcoholic , the homosexual , the incompetent , all derive in appreciable measure from disturbances in development of this nature . Here are some excerpts from actual case histories . The case histories are not to be approached in a spirit of pessimism . Most " successful " marriages , if scrutinized , would show some or many of the human situations here dis-  | cussed . Such successful marriages art those in which the marital partners have learned to understand disturbing aspects of their relationship sufficiently to ensure the comfortable continuance of family life . A frequent source of failure to achieve good adjustment in marriage is that seen in the life of a young man or woman who remains basically too dependent upon a mother or father . Some mothers refuse to give up their " prerogatives " as mothers ? continue to feel their demands upon the affection and interest of a son or daughter come first , resent the intrusion of an " outsider " to replace them . In turn , a son or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents rather than to spouse , may remain too convinced of the wisdom and power of the parent and too dependent to discover that he or she and the spouse constitute a family apart from the parents and are in a position to determine their own way of life , with or without parental sanction . THE MOTHER ATTACHMENT A young businessman , R. S. , sought the advice of a psychiatrist because he had a tendency toward depressive periods that at times severely interfered with his ability to devote himself to his business affairs and periodically he drank to excess . Superficially R. 's marital situation seemed to be satisfactory . Interview with his wife , however , made it clear that he was infantile and demanding toward her . She said : " I have three children , not two . " The family continued to live in the home of R. 's widowed mother . The mother presumably remained in the background , but actually all decision and program reflected her judgments and wishes . R. was the younger of two children , an energetic older sister whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere . As a child he was frail ; his mother remained solicitous , overprotecting , and maintained a strong guiding hand . The young man grew up , convinced of the high idealism and great wisdom of the mother to whom he referred all life decisions . His father had been a rather successful and capable businessman but obviously played a secondary role in the family life . The marital life developed by this man reflected a continuation of his role as a son who looked to women as protecting , maternal persons . His healthy ideas impelled him toward marriage and the establishment of a family . The childish and dependent aspects of his personality determined a great compromise , however ? that his family continue to live with his mother . I Ic refused to adopt that independent , active attitude toward his own wife that would make it impossible for her to find in him a " third child . "  | A situation such as this usually is not well tolerated by either partner in a marriage . This capable young man inwardly rebelled against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his idealization of his mother masked an intense resentment toward her as the person who limited and restricted him . His sense of duty and loyalty to her did not permit him to be aware of this deeper hostility . This conflictful attitude served to make it impossible for him to function freely either as dutiful son or independent man . When he was able to win for himself the permissions his mother was unable or unwilling to grant him , he found it quite possible to arrange a healthier mode of living and a happier marital relationship . THE FATHER ATTACHMENT This familiar picture of persistence of attachment to a mother on the part of a son has its counterpart in attitudes some young women maintain toward their fathers . An attractive young woman , H. S. , mother of a son and daughter , complained of fatigue , a feeling of inadequacy and discomfort when among her friends . She had lost her previous capacity to work actively at her home tasks and among a group of young women friends who were interested in various club and welfare activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had been married six years . Until recently she had considered her marriage successful , but now she questioned whether her discomforts might not be related to dissatisfactions in her marriage . She expressed affection for her husband . The sexual aspect of their marital life had always been on a wholesome and pleasant basis . Mrs. S. , however , indicated a growing disinterest in her husband 's physical approaches , and she was critical of him in many ways . She had concluded he was dull and uninspiring , too devoted to his business interests , not socially as active and as " interesting " to others as she thought he should be . Actually Mr. S. was a personable , pleasant , and capable man . He was head of a small manufacturing firm , successful financially . During the war he devoted long hours to his work , showed much ingenuity and capacity in bringing the wartime production of his plant to a high degree of efficiency , and made a real contribution to the war effort . He was rather a reserved man , friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as socially inclined as his wife , he encouraged her own social activities and took part himself with good grace , but only at times with enthusiasm . When Mrs. S. spoke of her father her voice kindled with enthusiasm . She described him as a dynamic , energetic , capable person , imaginative , resourceful , very successful in business affairs , inventive , and ingenious . Her father , she felt , was a much bigger personality than her husband . Somewhat  | pensively she commented on her father 's great preoccupation with his affairs that kept him away from home much of the time . Actually she had had relatively little contact with him during her childhood . Her affection and esteem for him , however , were unlimited . Mrs. S. 's dissatisfactions with her lot and her highly depreciatory attitude toward her husband reflect her appraisal of her father and her expectations and longing as a child toward him . By virtue of his very remoteness , her father could remain the highly idealized being he still represented in the fantasy of the daughter . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband was measured against the image of the ideal father and most certainly found wanting . No matter how effective he may be in reality , no flesh-and-blood husband , with the faults and weaknesses that usual husbands are bound to have , can stand the test of such a comparison . The childish longings in relation to such an idealized father remained to obstruct the possibility of a realistic appraisal of a husband . For Mrs. S. recognition and acknowledgment of the overemphasized role of this ancient , childhood feeling toward her father permitted a more mature evaluation of her actual life situation and of her relationship to her husband . She found it possible to recapture normal enthusiasm about the everyday affairs of real family and social life and to go ahead effectively in her role as wife and as mother . PERSISTENCE AS A CHILD The basic persistence of the concept of oneself as son or daughter , rather than as adult man or woman in marriage , reflects itself in many ways . A successful businessman , J. L. was anxious and uncertain about his work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his firm and placed in a position of authority over other men . Heretofore he had always been in a secondary position , with a boss over him to whom he could turn for advice and who had ultimate responsibility . He made no complaints about his marital life , but his wife was somewhat unhappy about their childless state . When questioned about this childlessness J. L. indicated that there were no children because his wife " had not insisted upon it , " that early in marriage it seemed quite a responsibility to have children , and now , relatively late , he thought himself and his wife a little too old to begin the rearing of a family . He knew of no physical obstacles to the having of children . J. was the younger of two sons , reared by a strict and authoritative father . Both boys obeyed him implicitly without thought of ever questioning the  | father 's authority , even when quite grown into manhood . When drafted into military service in World War I , J. L. was recommended for training in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying he preferred the position of a private rather than that of an officer with responsibilities possibly involving lives of other men . He served through the period of enlistment in a very competent manner , evidenced considerable personal courage in action , but never got beyond non-commissioned officer rating . On return to civilian life he started in a subsidiary position in the firm in which eventually he was promoted to a managerial position . Throughout life J. L. inwardly considered himself the son who should dutifully carry out the orders of a stronger and wiser father . He refused the authority that goes with the position of a father in rejecting training as an officer ? and in avoiding fatherhood in his marriage . When life circumstances made it impossible for him to escape any longer the real responsibilities of a fatherlike person he became psychologically upset and was finally forced to recognize and evaluate the limitations he had imposed upon himself . On gaining an understanding of the nature of his discomfort , he was able to make a good adjustment to the demands of his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life to start the rearing of a family and the rounding out of an otherwise good marital life . TIME REVEALS SOME MARITAL DIFFICULTIES Time and experience serve to bring about modifications in attitudes toward life situations . This fact is at times overlooked by a partner in marriage . A forty-three-year-old attorney , R. B. , had concluded he wished a divorce , but he was concerned about the possible effects of family disruption on his only child , a thirteen-year-old daughter . R. B. was an only son . His father , successful in law , tended to treat him much as " his boy . " Only in recent years had R. decided to pursue an independent career . He severed his professional association with his father and established a new firm . He remained quite close to his own parents , however . He considered his childhood life a happy one , spoke of the great devotion his mother had to home and family , and of her capacity to understand and anticipate his needs and those of his father . R. said that there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last two or three years this had been increasing . His wife was from a family of artistic and literary interests . She had achieved a modest success as a writer of short stories and radio scripts . R. was more impatient than pleased with her success , felt she neglected the home and her child in the service of her outside  | interests , and constantly compared her attitude toward home and family with that of his mother . Actually the household was a well-conducted and well-regulated one in which , however , the wife made generous use of household help to relieve her of routines . R. told how he was " madly in love " with his wife at first . He showered her with gifts and affection and did everything to meet her wishes . During their engagement they had a rather serious difference which led to a threat on the part of his fiancee to withdraw from the engagement . He " gave in " and never risked such a threat again for many years . During recent years , however , he had increasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself independently in his work there was a period of relative stringency ; he felt his wife did not go along with him in necessary reduction of expenses . He worked harder and harder , grew short and impatient with his wife . He concluded he was not in love with her any longer , became critical of her person , of her manner , of everything about her . He withdrew from her sexually and felt there was nothing attractive about her in any sense . He toyed with the idea that maybe he would fall in love with someone else , essayed a mild flirtation or two , but soon realized that his dissatisfaction with his wife had nothing to do with the possible attractiveness of other women . Finally , embittered by the innumerable deficiencies he apparently found in his wife , he concluded a divorce was in order . Mrs. B. was taken completely by surprise by the suggestion of divorce , as she had always considered herself fully devoted to her husband . She had been fully aware of his increasing irritability with her , attributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs , and had been urging him to find time for a holiday away from the demands of his work . She had long been uncomfortable and unhappy but assumed the " fault " was entirely with her husband . Here again two intelligent and well-intentioned people almost brought their marriage to dissolution because of inability to see their problem clearly . The initial equilibrium in this marriage was established by the somewhat too passive and too dependent attitudes of the young husband . Loving and affectionate by nature , he early adopted the attitude that security in love was dependent on conformity to all wishes and desires of his beloved . It was pretty much a matter of being a good boy so as to risk no rejection or anger , an attitude he held toward his parents as well . Relatively late in life , particularly under the stimulus of his successful independent activities in his profession , he achieved a basically more active attitude and reacted against his own earlier too-compliant tendencies . The wife , in the meantime , in all good faith , accepted the initial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband ,  | unaware of the fact that people can and do develop and change as they mature in years . The result was , finally , a " strike " on the part of the husband ; after having taught his wife over years of time to expect certain reactions on his part , he rebelled against the very situation he had largely brought about . It proved not too difficult for each of these people to gain perspective about their marriage and the nature of their difficulties . The real maturity the husband had achieved enabled him , albeit a bit painfully , to recognize the immature , dependent attitude that determined his earlier need to yield in all issues . The wife was truly surprised to discover that she had been much too complacent in her expectations of her husband . It was interesting to note that she was actually stimulated and challenged by the necessity to understand herself and her relationship with her husband . Not infrequently failure on the part of a young woman to cope adequately with marital life is determined by disturbing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two related pertinent concepts are ( 1 ) the idea that sexuality is vulgar or " bad " and hence forbidden , possibly dangerous , and ( 2 ) a woman 's role , particularly in marriage , is considered by her to be a secondary and depreciated role . It is not difficult to understand how and why many young women consider sexuality and sexual behavior undesirable ? something at best to be tolerated more or less under duress in marriage . This attitude is in part a heritage of the recent Victorian era in which all sexual interests were considered , at best , bad taste ; at worst , sinful . Some mothers succeed in transmitting to their daughters attitudes toward sex that make it difficult , if not impossible , for the daughters to accept the sexual marital role as one consistent with self-respect and dignity . At times the sexual role is envisaged not merely as " bad , " but as brutal , painful , dangerous to physical health ; something to be suffered rather than experienced as part of a creative way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a conscientious , scrupulous mother . She concerned herself carefully with the rearing of her daughters , with emphasis upon personal cleanliness and strict morals . While her children were quite young the emphasis upon health was extreme ; e.g. , regularity in bowel movement occupied a position of first importance , with ready recourse to enemas or other means of internal " purification " at the slightest provocation . The father in this family was a mild-mannered , good-natured bookkeeper , who provided for the material security of his family but left the rearing of the daughters entirely to the energetic wife and mother .  | As the girls matured the mother was insistent that marriage was something to be avoided , sexual behavior to be deplored , and the bearing of children an onerous and distasteful burden to which no daughter of hers should submit . She emphasized the dangers and discomforts of pregnancy and the trials and cares involved in the rearing of children . One devoted all one 's time and energy to the rearing of a family with no prospect of thanks , reward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations had no justification . The daughters in this family were intelligent and capable . All of them , nevertheless , were sufficiently impressed by the mother 's attitudes that none was able to accept the prospect of marriage . Of the three , one , after a period of residence away from home , was able to question the desirability of a life without marriage and sought psychiatric advice . She came to an understanding of the distortions in the mother 's attitudes and the effect of these on her own life relationships and eventually she married , armed with understanding which should prevent a repetition of the mistakes in her own rearing in relation to a daughter of her own . The two sisters remained victims of the great limitations imposed by the mother , unmarried , restricted in social outlook , both still preoccupied with problems of physical health in keeping with the mother 's great concern in this field . Without the specific depreciation of the sexual role as above discussed , many girls grow into womanhood with the deep conviction that women are cast in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman 's position is a depreciated one . We can not discuss those important cultural and social considerations that play a large role in the determination of such feeling on the part of women . It is a fact that in some societies women may be in the position of chattel rather than in equal partnership in life relations . But even in a society such as our own , where in some respects femininity carries with it special prerogatives , there is still a tendency on the part of some women to feel that the world is essentially a man 's world ? boys and men only can achieve full personal freedom and full expression of their potentialities , while women are thwarted and can not do the same . The result is a tendency to regard homemaking , the bearing and rearing of children as routine , dull , and not a source of gratification as creative work . Whether or not social attitudes provoke convictions as to presumable inferiority of women as compared with men , we can recognize very early a questioning by both boys and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A not uncommon conclusion arrived at by very small  | children is that girls are in some measure deficient . To the small child the lack of an obvious genital organ seems to constitute a deficiency . This is not a theoretical assumption about children . It is something that quite a few children remark upon directly and openly and about which , at times , they need correct information . Often , however , because of anxiety on the part of a child or lack of awareness or prudery on the part of a parent , the whole questioning attitude is repressed . The uncertainty and depreciated evaluation of the little girl remain , however , to color the attitude of both boy and girl . As might be expected , such attitudes toward the person or the functioning of women are likely to evolve in families in which little girls may be given reason to believe that their brothers are more highly valued by one of the parents . Some parents openly prefer sons to daughters . In such a family a girl may remain convinced that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strive to become the sort of person the desired son would have been . A certain number of professional women soft-ball players are daughters of fathers who had really hoped to have a son rather than a daughter ; a son who should be a fine figure on the baseball field . The daughter attempts to meet the father 's hopes and expectations by pinchhitting , as it were , for the desired son . It does not help them much in their development as girls and women . A child 's greatest need is to be loved and valued by parents as he is ; this is the key to the possibility of developing self-dignity and a sense of personal worth-whileness . If this self-evaluation is disturbed by the concept that only boys are truly valued by parents , there ensues a never-ending struggle with the proposition that to accept femininity is to accept something inferior . Many marriages are disturbed by this hidden repudiation of femininity . Resistance to acceptance of the sexual role in marriage , resentment at the demands of household and children , envy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband disturb the equanimity of many families . Any realistic appraisal of the relative positions of man and woman in marriage would allow for the biological fact that men and women are different in their roles ; that their differences can not be gauged on a single scale of values but in terms of complementary functions and activities that make for successful joint living together in marriage . Whenever , by virtue c ; f circumstances or because of pressures depending upon personality pecu-  | liarities , one partner is thrust unduly into the role usually carried by the other , a natural equilibrium is disturbed . This equilibrium , in a healthy marriage , is one in which the wide range of basic needs and desires of both partners is adequately met . These include the need for love and affection , satisfaction of the more ideal expectations of a respected and beloved partner , material security , social prestige , parenthood , sexual expression of love . To be sure , the manner and degree to which these needs are met vary widely , and the nature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage may sustain some degree of limitation in both degree and range of satisfactions in the several fields , but . it is clear to see from the cases cited above that the possibility of a workable equilibrium can readily be disturbed . This is particularly true when the basic attitudes outlined earlier tend toward a denial of the validity of one 's own or one 's partner 's needs in marriage . Psychiatrists who have an opportunity to scrutinize the conflicting rational and non-rational attitudes of their patients are able to outline with considerable precision the nature of some of these situations of conflict . Referring back to the attitude on the part of some young women that their role in marriage is secondary , or a depreciated one , one finds with rather astonish'ng regularity a characteristic sequence of inner reaction and external behavior . Such a young woman , impelled by healthy impulses toward marriage and motherhood , nevertheless unconsciously tends to select as a mate a man who she instinctively feels will not overwhelm her sexually or otherwise , will not dominate or coerce her , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In actuality , however , such a woman to whom prestige and position mean so much will expect a great deal of her husband , real adequacy if not superiority in all fields , vocational , social , sexual . She will wish him to achieve for her all that she feels she is denied because she is a woman . Having selected as a mate a man whom she considers not too dangerous or threatening , she now senses and resents in him the very deficiencies that enabled her to accept him as a mate . She becomes depreciatory toward him , aggressive and hostile toward him for failing to meet her more conscious concepts of what a husband should be like . Many versions of this theme are encountered in real life . If a wife is able to see through the contradictory character of her own expectations she may be able to protect herself from the effects of such a vicious cycle , gain more assurance as to the valid aspects of her relationship with her husband , and achieve a workable association in marriage . Similarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implications of such an attitude he , too , may be able to do much to promote a healthier equilibrium . It must be remembered that it takes two to create any given life situation . The husband , in the type of marriage we are discussing , certainly has made his initial contribution to the difficulty . Those attitudes of unaggressiveness and passivity that made him seem sufficiently non-dangerous to the neurotic part of his wife 's feeling do exist in him ; the question is whether they exist in such degree and operate so automatically as to play into the cycle of fear , depreciation , expectation , and disappointment to which we have referred . He may be able to see that , after all , his apparently domineering and aggressive wife is really dependent upon him and his life success for basic satisfaction as he is dependent upon her . If so , he may surmount his own reactions of resentment and hostility toward his wife , insist on fulfillment of standards of performance he sets up for himself , and in this manner tend to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the persistence of psychologically disturbed patterns of behavior in marriage . It is apparent from what has been said that deeply implanted attitudes inimical to successful adjustments in marriage disturb or disrupt many marriages in the ways described . It has been stated that these attitudes usually evolve during the course of development of the child toward maturity and are dependent in considerable measure upon the nature of the training and rearing . It should here be emphasized , however , that all too often the nature and the very existence of these disturbing attitudes are not recognized or are explicitly denied by the victims themselves . In personal relationships and in understanding of inner motivations , desires , and strivings , objectivity and rational understanding are achieved with much greater difficulty than in other fields of human inquiry . Many people are never able to approach rational understanding of their own behavior and motivations , although maturing life experience helps in the direction of such understandings . Our medical experience shows , however , that precisely those people who are most disturbed in their marital relationships often fail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the divorce court is frequently followed by a marriage in which the same marital difficulties are again encountered . One has succeeded in separating oneself from an unhappy situation , but not from the basic attitudes and expectations that made the first marriage an unhappy one and that operate the same way in a second marriage . Perhaps there is little point in the termination of marriage unless there is basic  | clarity as to the nature of the deficiencies in the relationship . Nothing short of such understanding can offer much in the way of insurance against the possibility of a repeat act in a subsequent marriage . On the other hand , such understanding frequently makes possible the successful continuance of a threatened marriage .  | Let us suppose that the choice of the marriage mate has been such that there is a reasonable hope that the partners can carry through their respective roles with at least average success . The excitement of the wedding and the precarious decisions of the honeymoon are recently past , and the happy couple are back home , ready to begin the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the housing problem is passably well solved , and there is need to meet the perplexities of everyday life as married couples everywhere must meet them if they are to accomplish the purposes of marriage on an adult level . The health and hygiene of marriage must take the place which until now has been played by starry-eyed romance , though we shall wish , of course , that some of the latter may linger . As a matter of fact , a state of health in the marriage relation will enable romance to persist , just as wholesome food will permit health in the usual sense to persist . Romance must be fed with solid food ; it can not long thrive on cake and kisses . We may suppose that the couple have married at a time when each was hungry for sexual contact with the beloved one . If such is not the case they should have waited longer , or , failing this , should continue the courtship even though the marriage vows have been said . Healthy young people will find the new privileges extraordinarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them so . They must learn to use sexual gratification somewhat as they use food , to the end that they may grow in vigor and in appreciation , and thus to accomplish the purposes of sex .  | PURPOSES OF SEX RELATIONS What are the purposes of sex ? They are three : 1 . Procreation . If civilization , culture , race , and nation are to be preserved , persons of health , character , and ability must reproduce themselves and furnish heredity , environment , and the training so necessary to the continuation of the species on a high level . This is a duty of those who have good bodies and minds ? even more , it is a privilege . 2 . Self-expression . There is something in the nature of men and women which makes them desire intimate contact with a loved one of the opposite sex , and with that one to produce and enjoy his or her own offspring . A deep sentiment is involved and must be gratified if the individual is to reap a rich emotional family life . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he or she enjoy this family relation and is the better for that enjoyment . 3 . Security . Men and women are more secure when there is between them a rich sexual relation and their children share this security . The infancy of the human child is longer than that of any other species of young ; he needs his parents until he is fully grown and even beyond that time . Anything , then , which will hold his parents together is a protection to him and to , the entire family . The ability of the parents to use sex for such a purpose is of vast importance to all who comprise the family group . A marriage starts then with a couple hungry for sexual contact . It is well . But the happy lovers must remember that it will not always be so . They will soon satiate themselves to some extent , at least . Is that , then , the end of love or the beginning of the end ? It may well be the death of romance unless there is an understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be supposed that the institution of marriage was designed merely to furnish safe conditions for intercourse , though obviously that is one of the objectives . There will come a time when even the most ardent man or woman will desire something else ? something more . Early in married life the couple must begin to develop other objectives than intercourse . As the years pass these will become more satisfying and precious and will come ultimately to replace the pleasures of sexual union . As a result happiness can continue indefinitely as a reward for wise and meritorious behavior . An analogy may serve to illustrate our point . Let us suppose that a man is building a new house in which he expects to live . In the beginning he is enormously interested in the digging of the foundation and visits the site  | twice a day to observe progress . This foundation seems most important ? as indeed it is ; it even seems most fascinating ? as indeed it well may be . Later , as the house progresses , he transfers his interest to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completion , he moves into and lives in it with no further thought for the foundation . This is as it should be unless one strangely prefers to live one 's whole life in the basement , as so many do ? speaking sexually . We repeat that the basement of the house is important and that sexual intercourse , which is the foundation of happy married life , is important , but it is not the whole of the house or of the marriage . We shall hope that the foundation upon which the house or the home is built is utterly sound and secure ; we wish that it will be as carefully and scientifically constructed as able workmanship can provide , but we must remember that it is a means to an end rather than an end in itself . Intercourse between two persons deeply in love has many rewards in addition to and exceeding those of physical gratification . The householder who comes home after an honest day 's work has a right to expect an attractive , well-cooked , and nicely served dinner ? provided , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excessively worn by the day 's work . If the food is on the table at six o'clock he will eat , enjoy the food , and then give no more thought to food during the remainder of the evening . If he is still waiting at seven he will be restless ; by eight o'clock he will be angry if he is not served ; by nine o'clock he will be furious , and probably long before ten he will have gone to the corner restaurant . Sex is much like food in this respect ; persons who are not fed at home are tempted ? at least ? to go elsewhere . Or if the food is on the table at six but consists of a can of salmon , a bottle of milk , and a box of crackers ? all of it nourishing but carelessly served ? the man of the house is likely to think that it is a poor home that is his and may go elsewhere . The wife whose husband is too lazy or too stupid to try for a bit of glamour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more consideration for her feelings . We are not attempting to justify the implied misconduct associated with this analogy but only to show the attitudes of mind which lead to such misconduct . CLEANLINESS ESSENTIAL But enough of analogies . What are the actual factors which have a good or a bad effect upon marriage happiness ? There is tidiness , for example . It is doubtful if there is anything more destructive to romance than soiled underwear or body odor . They must be guarded against with the utmost care , and  | yet one must have a smattering of good judgment too . If the housewife must do her own laundry she may not wish her husband to be overly free with the linen . She may prefer to have him wear his underwear until it is really soiled a bit than to be confronted with a mountain of washing and ironing each week . Possibly her husband would rather have her wear her dainties longer than to have her exhausted with the effort to keep herself " as sweet as when she stepped out of her bath two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a husband may be so dainty that there is no comfort in living with it , or her , or him . One can not relax well in a home or with a person who is too nice to get a bit messed up . After all , there is the work of the world to be done , and it is impossible for workers to avoid soil and perspiration entirely . All of this is a matter for adjustment . Much the same may be said of the matter of personal cleanliness . Surely we can not compromise with cleanliness , and yet cleanliness is a relative term . A home can not be managed as would be the surgery operating room in a hospital . There are those who bathe twice or more times a day and others who follow the once-a-week pattern . Certain parts of the body require particular care ? the genital area , the feet , the armpits , the hair , and the mouth . Genital odors ? if they are not excessive ? may be stimulating to some , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they can be detected in casual contacts or when one is in the same room with the individual from whom they exude . External cleanliness is all that is necessary to prevent such objectionable odors . A cleansing douche is often refreshing , but it is not usually necessary for the prevention of odor . An antiseptic douche will tend to kill the useful bacteria found in the vaginal tract and is best not used . Such a douche is not an adequate contraceptive device and may lead to abnormal discharges which are more offensive than the natural odors of the vaginal tract . Bathing should be adjusted to the sensitivity of the conjugal partner and the convenience of the bathing facilities . Those persons who are so fortunate as to have hot water and a modern bathroom should remember that bathing may be a major operation in a crowded home without modern sanitary conveniences . Clearly in such a home frequent bathing could put a serious strain upon the one bathing and upon those who must live with him or her . In any consideration of health an evaluation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely possible to make such a fuss about matters pertaining to health as to cause health to be lost rather than gained . Just as nothing can 1w so dangerous as the assurance that one is absolutely safe , so nothing can be  | so injurious to health as to give to health matters one 's entire attention . The couple who work too hard and worry too much attempting to make the home perfection in these matters are likely to be too tired and harassed to enjoy the precious privileges when and if they arc attained . Such is far from being a healthful state of affairs . The mother who spends so much time working for the children that she has no energy left to play with them is not being wise . The father who kills himself or injures himself in the effort to provide everything for his family is failing to provide them with what they need most ? himself . His sacrifice is noble , perhaps , but strangely unappreciated in many instances . It is wrong from the standpoint of the healthfulness of a marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be spendthrifts and to keep the economic status of the family in a perpetual state of jeopardy ; it is equally wrong for them to make such a fetish of the economic stability that they keep the emotional status of the family in a perpetual state of jeopardy . It is possible to be a spendthrift in more ways than one . He who wastes love , the opportunity to play with his children , and to be one in a lovely family is of all spendthrifts the worst ? the one most to be pitied ? or despised . HYGIENE OF THE BEDROOM The bed and bedroom of a married couple hold an important place in their health and hygiene relations . Obviously there are several reasons why it is better to have separate beds , and the hygienists will feel disposed to insist upon these points . One sleeps better when he or she is alone , the cover can be better adjusted , there is less danger of transmitting respiratory infections , and there are several other advantages . On the other hand , there are definite disadvantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more bedroom space . The crux of the matter lies not in such practical considerations , however , but in those emotional and conjugal ones which are the heart and soul of marriage . There are many conveniences and enjoyments in the double bed which can not be well set down on paper . They lead to a rich warm comradeship which is utterly priceless to many couples who would not wish to be labeled " old-fashioned " at all . We should recommend that young people give the double bed a try and that older couples make the transition from one twin bed to the other easy and frequent , and as often in one direction as the other . We can hardly imagine a more effective damper of romance than separate rooms for husband and wife , or the prac-  | tice of having one or the other sleeping with a child . The practice of sleeping in separate rooms or beds so that the number of children can be held down may or may not have the desired results in this respect , and it may or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less unattainable . We are keenly aware that there are many differences in tastes and that there are really good reasons for separation of the beds . Bad breath , body odor , snoring , restlessness , pulling of the covers , marked differences in sleeping habits , and other peculiarities may make it desirable for the couple to separate themselves in the interest of continued affection . Certainly the beds should be separated when one or the other has a transmissible disease . Sometimes the beds may be set so close together as barely to avoid touching and the advantages of both the single and the double bed pretty largely attained . Whatever the arrangement , it should be the one which gives the least cause for mutual dissatisfaction and the greatest possible opportunity for the unhampered enjoyment of marital rights and privileges . There are persons who like to indulge in minor " vulgarities " when under sexual stimulation . They may wish to use words which they would not use at other times , and they may rightly feel that the technical words properly used in a scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimacy of sexual stimulation . All of this is a matter for adjustment . The relation should be neither stilted nor vulgar . It is an intimate contact which calls for words of endearment , for pet names and delicate shades of meaning ? for anything , indeed , that will enhance the enjoyment and bring appreciation and happiness to both partners , but in particular to the other partner . Cave men may be desirable to cave women , but most women probably prefer to live and make love under more civilized surroundings . A man may wish his wife to be free in her affections , but he will rarely want her to be wanton . NUDITY Whether or not the nude body is to be exposed to view is another matter for individual taste . A great many women have been reared in such a way that nudity will inevitably seem vulgar to them . In such case the husband who seeks to indulge his wish to see his wife in that condition may spoil all chance of enjoyment on her part . Women with beautiful bodies may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derive much pleasure from such behavior , but a puritanical man may sec in it an evidence of vulgarity which is highly repugnant to him . Women with less attractive  | forms may well wish to dim the lights or prefer darkness for their lovemaking , much to the disgust of the husband who feels that he needs stimulation of every sort to attain the degree of stimulation which his tardy responses require . Men should remember that the " human form divine " is usually feminine . Clearly the male body is less glamorous in itself than is that of the " pin-up girl " variety . This matter of degrees of exposure and light in the room when making love is something to be given careful consideration if success is to be expected . Each of the couple should be very careful to avoid pressing the point . Obviously it is a matter of taste rather than morals , but there is no accounting for tastes in this or any other regard . FREQUENCY OF SEXUAL INTERCOURSE The question as to how often intercourse may be " indulged " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is amazing that a great many books and pamphlets written to instruct in such matters should attempt to answer this question by giving a definite number ( " twice a week " ) . Nothing could be more absurd . It would be like undertaking to say how often a couple should go to a dance or to a picture show . Individual preference and ability will vary so widely that it is utterly impossible to give a categorical answer . Since the act is good and gives great pleasure ; since it is perfectly legitimate in marriage and binds the couple closer together when performed properly , it would seem that repetition as often as it can be satisfyingly performed should be encouraged . Even writers who profess to great beauty in the act will tend to warn against what they call excessive indulgence . Obviously the determining factor should not be a dictum in'a book but one that is closely related to the desires and the capacities of the couple . Without wishing to be arbitrary in such a personal matter we believe that the following principles are sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the husband and the wife desire it . 2 . It should be an invigorating experience leading to a state of relaxation , satisfaction , or exhilaration which is conducive to sound sleep or peace with the world as determined by the time of day . 3 . Due consideration must be given to the matter of childbearing in the determination of frequency and methods to be used . Within these limits satisfying intercourse in wedlock is of tremendous value to the couple , to the family , and to the stability of society at large . It is impossible to see how one can come to any other conclusion than that ?  | within these restrictions ? intercourse is an extremely practical art which should be studied , improved , and finally made perfect . On the other hand , it is doubtful if anything could be more disgusting or irritating than a husband ? or a wife ? who coaxes or demands sexual satisfaction at the most inopportune and embarrassing times , or who wishes to indulge himself or herself at the expense of the other partner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even exhausted as a result of his demands must surely feel a marked sense of shame if he can feel at all . The wife who sees her husband going tired to his work need not be surprised if he amounts to nothing and is unable to-tarn the home and the security which they need . Excessive childbearing can make of the marriage bed a place of danger and fear ; can make the home a place of chaos full of squalling babies and wet , smelly diapers . It is a wise couple who know how to steer a course between excessive indulgence on the one hand and sexual starvation on the other . When the husband and wife are rather equally balanced in their sexuality the problem is obviously much easier than when one is hot and the other cold . In the latter instance great tact , patience , and forbearance are needed in the early months of marriage if a satisfactory arrangement is to be expected . Let us suppose ? for the sake of variety ? that the wife is the more amorous ; that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can give to make her thoroughly satisfied with her home and marriage . In such case the husband will do well to play with her as much as he can before beginning the act itself ; as soon as she has attained an orgasm he will do well to withdraw and save his energy for the next time , which will come all too soon for his relatively weak powers . At once it will be pointed out by those who still believe in the old-time physiology that he will seriously injure his nervous system by indulging in an incomplete act . Actually the incomplete act is less injurious in such a case than would be overindulgence . If he does not permit himself to get too close to the orgasm it is not injurious at all . Such an arrangement allows many happy acts of love on the part of the husband and a corresponding number of highly satisfying experiences for the wife . The incomplete act ? so far as the husband is concerned ? is a sort of kiss of affection and endearment at a time when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be exhausted by the complete act . The wife of such a considerate man should be very grateful and appreciative and should be more than eager to make up to him for any inconvenience the seance may have caused him . By such an arrangement  | he will not need to wonder whether the eager wife is tempted to make a cuckold of him ? a source of considerable additional satisfaction . He will be able to feel a great pride of accomplishment in being able to hold the love of an amorous woman ? no small accomplishment ! He will be insuring the safety of his home for himself and his children . It is generally supposed that it is more likely to be the husband who is excessive in his demands . What can a conscientious wife do to take care of such a situation ? other than make a martyr of herself ? There is indeed much that she can do if she loves the man and wishes to make him happy . Sexual intercourse is exhausting to a wife only when she puts herself into it actively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or nearly so , she can satisfy her husband without tiring herself . At such a time she may well ask him to get along with the project of attaining an ejaculation ; she may ask that he cut short the amorous dallying which at other times would be welcome ; she may likely need a lubricant ; and she may properly ask him to take responsibility for the contraceptive used ? if one is used . She should not pity herself and pout about it , but should co-operate to the extent that is necessary for the quick attainment of the relaxation that he may greatly need . How great must be the appreciation of a husband whose wife , observing his unrest , suggests or gladly acquiesces to a short act of intercourse which will ease his tension and permit him to get the sleep which he needs if he is to do the work of the morrow . It is. of such things that happiness in marriage is made . We understand that intercourse with a passive wife may not seem exciting , but when it makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his appreciation of the unselfishness and love she bears him , it serves a purpose which is very precious indeed . It is far to be preferred to the arrangement which may make him too susceptible to the charms of his secretary or the unsatisfied woman he may meet when he is away from home . DISPARITY OF SEX ORGANS While the genital organs of a given couple are usually of average size and therefore quite compatible , it is entirely possible that there will be some degree of physical disproportion . It must not be supposed that such disparity will necessarily present great difficulty if there is the desire on the part of the two partners to make the attempt to correct the situation by making adjustments . If , for example , the penis is too small to give full satisfaction compensation may be made if the wife will place under her buttocks a pil-  | low or , even better , a few folds of firm , thick blanket which will have the effect of preventing her from sinking down too low in the bed . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small of the back will turn her pelvis away from her husband in such a way as to avoid too deep entrance . The use of a lubricant such as a surgical or a contraceptive jelly will be of assistance . Investigation by a physician of muscular spasm at the vaginal entrance or search for inflamed or tender areas may be called for . It must be borne in mind that by means of different positions of intercourse and other adaptive measures the organs will gradually become more yielding to disproportions . TIMING IN SEXUAL INTERCOURSE There may be difficulty in timing . Usually such differences can be overcome by the exercise of some effort on the part of the one partner , or restraint on the part of the other . As a rule it is the husband who tends to come to the climax first . In such case he is likely to ejaculate too early and leave the wife unsatisfied . This can sometimes be corrected by spending more time with sex play before the actual conjugation is attempted , or the husband may cease his movements but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tardy wife . There is a belief that the two orgasms must be simultaneous if the best results are to be obtained . This is by no means necessary . There are indeed advantages in having the wife reach the climax first . Usually she will have no objection to a brief continuance after she has attained satisfaction . By this arrangement the one or the other is in full possession of control at all times and can more readily assist the other in the climax of the act . This is of course a matter of personal preference and control as to whether the one or the other method shall be used . The husband can usually attain satisfaction from the very first though he may not be very expert in the early months of marriage . The wife , on the other hand , may have to learn to relax and to induce the orgasm . Many brides are bitterly disappointed that they are not successful at first . It is not unusual to hear of a young wife who is relatively unsuccessful until after the birth of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frigid but only that she is inexperienced . Rarely does the condition continue if the husband is co-operative and skillful and she is willing to relax and to learn . The matter of relaxation is quite important . Young women have been taught to restrain themselves ; the muscles of the pelvic region ( perineum ) are tight and strong . The nervous type of girl may need more rest and sleep than she had  | been getting in the premarital period ; she may need to sit in a warm bath for ten or twenty minutes before attempting intercourse ; she must have great love for and reliance in her mate ; she needs to have perfect confidence in her contraceptive protection or , even better , to be willing to accept a pregnancy as the natural outcome of the act of copulation . Quite naturally she probably will not wish to become pregnant immediately after marriage , nor will she wish to be submerged by a deluge of children . In such case she can relax only when she is reasonably sure that pregnancy will not ensue . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude toward marriage will fail to attain success in intercourse if she has a husband whom she loves and respects and who is willing to put the attainment of her success before his own . Sometimes we hear of women who arc so eager to experience an orgasm that they try too hard and exhaust themselves in the effort . Hysterical tears and frenzied effort are hardly consistent with the reasonable hope of success in such case . They may be quite disastrous . Success in this important matter is something that may be requested but not commanded . Rarely is a frontal attack upon the objective successful . One may eagerly invite happiness of this sort , but one is not permitted to demand it at the cost of tears and sobs . It will not obey such a summons . It must be pointed out that women of this sort are not frigid ? the frigid woman just does n't want anything to do with such business , Frigidity is far too complex a phenomenon for us to discuss in detail here . The too-eager wife usually needs only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PREVENTION OF CONCEPTION It is not our purpose in this place to discuss in detail methods of contraception . They do , however , relate themselves to the whole matter of marital hygiene . They may constitute an occasional hazard and so need to be discussed in this place . There are those women and men who will feel a twinge of conscience in the use of them inasmuch as they have been taught that they are somewhat immoral or that they are dangerous in some way . There are couples who hold such a warranted fear of pregnancy that they can in no wise enjoy conjugal relations without them . There are some methods , like the intra-uterine stem , which are actually somewhat dangerous to health and should be avoided for that reason ; others are ineffectual , like the douche , and by failure lead to a distrust of all such means ; and still others  | are such a nuisance as to be quite disturbing , particularly to the less amorous member of the pair . How shall these dangers be avoided ? In the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter for the individual couple and one which would best have been decided before marriage . It seems to the author that intercourse has three purposes , as mentioned in an earlier paragraph , not merely the one purpose of procreation . It is argued by some that not even the beasts are so crass as to have intercourse for pleasure only . Well , maybe that is the reason they have remained beasts , while man has developed all of the lovely sentiments and emotions which cluster about the home and have made the human species ' ' superior to the cattle of the field . It just seems to us that a husband and wife need to be much in each other 's arms , while at the same time in this complex world they need to have some control over the number of children they may beget . It must be admitted , however , that such is only one man 's opinion and not to be considered binding on others . To practice contraception or not to practice contraception is a matter for the individual couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can and do agree on the principle and the methods involved . DANGEROUS DOUCHES As a matter of danger there is little to be said except that the use of poisonous douches is obviously wrong . The vaginal mucous membrane will absorb bichloride of mercury , phenol , and other such products , as does the stomach . Irritating douches are a menace . For example , suppose a cresol douche is made up with hard water and the strength is gauged by the color of the mixture . The milky color is really due to the hardness of the water . When a wife uses soft water ( away from home , perhaps ) and the white color does not develop promptly , she is prone to add more cresol and to get a bad burn . Sometimes warm water is not available for a douche . Cold water may be a considerable shock to the organs flushed with blood as they are after intercourse . A stem pessary reaching into the cavity of the uterus obviously may carry infection upward from the vagina . A method of contraception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it fails at a crucial time , causing either the husband or wife or both to be very much put out and possibly to be excessively outspoken on the subject . It is our opinion that there is no contraceptive device which is absolutely foolproof . All of them require intelligent use and a certain amount of self-restraint at a time when restraint is not easy to attain . A failure at a  | crucial time may jeopardize the possibility of confidence in such methods at all subsequent attempts . Couples using contraceptives should remember that in all probability the product of a failure will at a later period be the most precious thing in their lives , and that an occasional failure is nearly always a good thing . It will be fortunate if they remember that he who dances must at least occasionally pay the piper . By all means the method chosen must be one which puts the burden of bother and responsibility upon the one of the pair who is most anxious to have intercourse . The amorous man who requires his reluctant wife to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? may have his enjoyment and then get to sleep is certainly not being very wise in looking after his own pleasure . A more accurate way of destroying the last vestige of passion could hardly be devised . Early in marriage the use of the condom is safer in such a time of inexperience . The method has its many objections but is far preferable to diaphragms , douches , and contraceptive jellies , foams , suppositories , and the like , so long as the wife is relatively uninterested . Even after the wife has become more passionate it would be well if the husband would share with her the trouble , restraint , and annoyance that is inherent in all of these methods . We want it distinctly understood that we are not urging the use of contraceptives but merely pointing out the various possibilities of physical injury or annoyance which may result in injury to the lovely relation which should exist between a husband and wife . We are strongly of the opinion that couples will be far happier as a rule and the marriages will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as will satisfy the natural parental desires of the individuals concerned . It is well known , for example , that women with children live longer on the average than those without children . There is no doubt that marriages with children are less likely to end in divorce . Certainly it must be evident that couples with children get tremendous enjoyment out of them and that there is no place in the world so lonely as the old people 's home for childless men and women . Men who have something to work for are more likely to succeed in business or in the professions and , in spite of the increased expense of children , amass more wealth on the average than do men without such expensive responsibilities . There is such a thing as being compelled to make good . A man with a family of four or five children has a far more definite incentive than does he who rides alone . When pregnancy occurs there is much for the wife and the husband ? now prospective parents ? to learn . They should first go ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have not made such a connection they should do so at once and stay close to such an adviser during this period ? a period of some stress , but also one capable of very high and most Aatisfying idealism . The emotions of two good persons loving each other , legally married , and conscious of the soul-stirring fact of pregnancy are so precious and so colnplicated that it is utterly impossible to give any conception of them on a printed page . The individual who has missed this experience has missed the most exalted experience which life has to offer . What about intercourse during pregnancy ? This question has been answered negatively in a categorical way far too many times . One who understands the anatomy and physiology of pregnancy will see in the relation no danger whatever , provided two or three things are remembered . 1 . Need a loving husband be reminded that he must be very careful and gentle at such a time and that he must under no possibility hurt his wife ? It would seem that this is very evident . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural labor is evidently likely to happen within the next few weeks . The reason is to be found in the fact that infectious germs might be introduced into the birth canal . 3 . If such an act would leave the wife nervous or restless it should be avoided because nothing must be permitted to disturb the mother and child at such a time if it possibly can be avoided . It is significant that many wives are unusually passionate during pregnancy . Sometimes it is the only period in their married life when they can have intercourse without fear of pregnancy ; sometimes the consciousness of the tremendous role which is being enacted makes the couple more than commonly precious to each other . Pregnancy is ? and properly should be ? a period of high purpose and unselfish dedication to a great function . Under such a stimulus the prospective parents may well draw nearer to each other in their resolve that , come what will , they will protect , develop , and cherish the child which is developing between them . If refraining from intercourse will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? within the limits mentioned above ? has the effect of binding them together more permanently , their own welfare and that of the child is served . INTERCOURSE AMONG THE ELDERLY What about intercourse as one grows older ? Quite naturally the hot fires of youth will abate as the years pass . It is well . There are other things in life than passionate love ? other things which are even more precious and en-  | during . The appreciation of these other things should be developed as one becomes more and more mature . Then as the fires of passion grow dimmer there will be other sources of warmth and comfort in the days that would otherwise be cold and lonesome . How foolish is the man who says , " When I get too old to chase a blonde I shall be willing to begin chasing a golf ball ! " Or the man who says , " When I grow too old to be interested in a pretty woman I shall be ready to die ! " How foolish is the woman past the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and act as if she were eighteen . It is surprising sometimes that she should succeed so well with her skin and fail so badly with her understanding of life . She , of course , fools no one but herself ? if we may suppose that she succeeds in fooling herself . Be your age , Grandma , and be happy ! It will surprise many readers to know that many old couples still are able to enjoy sexual relations ? even ardent intercourse ? when they are in their seventies and even occasionally beyond . Which ones are they ? They are the ones who have been highly successful in such matters in their younger years , the ones who have saved their precious powers and protected them from disease , promiscuity , and abuse . They have not wasted or thrown away their heritage but have developed it and used it to make themselves strong and capable . Many such women greatly enjoy intercourse for long years after the menopause . By having " passed " in the early years of enjoyment they have earned the right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beautiful picture it is to see an elderly couple supremely happy with life as it is lived by a good old man and a sweet old lady . One can only envy the one who at eighty is able to enjoy the companionship or the memory of the one who has meant more to him or her than any other . Surely this is success in life ! It would be better to fail in all else and succeed at home than to succeed in all else and fail at home .
