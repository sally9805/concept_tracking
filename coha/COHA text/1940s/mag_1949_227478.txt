The 600 people who met last week in Rome 's stifling little Teatro Valle were Fascists-or the closest thing to Fascists at large in Italy today . The occasion was a four-day national congress of the Movimento Sociale Italiano , which since its furtive foundation 2 years ago has managed to make itself a minor political force in Italy . In last year 's elections , M.S.I , polled half a million votes ( out of more than 26 million ) ; it is the largest political group at the universities of Pisa , Perugia , Naples and Palermo . M.S.I , is chiefly a refuge for discontented white-collar workers and disenchanted youths . <P> Past Glories . Among the delegates at the congress were a few grey heads , schoolteachers and oldtime Fascist functionaries , but most were youngsters . In the red and gilt boxes sat such patrons as Marchesa Eloisa Marignoli , one of the party 's chief backers , who languidly fanned her stiff , white-powdered face . <P> From another box , eight plainclothesmen watched the proceedings . Italian law forbids " apologies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their language . Most of the time , when they meant fascism , they simply spoke of " past glories . " <P> Chief attraction was the leader , Giorgio Almirante , small-time journalist and propagandist formerly in Mussolini 's service , who , after the Duce 's fall , made a living as a messenger boy and traveling salesman . A ferret-like little man , he stood behind the microphone while the delegates cheered . Said he : " I stand at attention before the legion of sorrow . " He continued : " They say we are sentimentalists , that we long for a past which died with one man . But we are like the apostles who gained their faith through the martyrdom of Christ . " <P> The seance continued . Once it looked as though Mussolini 's own ghost had returned when one Luigi Filosa , a Fascist henchman , got up to speak ; Filosa was short and bald , stood squarely with his hands on his hips and stuck out his lower lip in characteristic Mussolinian truculence . From dark corners of the auditorium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who shouted : " Democracy is a fraud ! " was arrested by the watchful secret service men . The hysterical speakers babbled on . Yelled a woman teacher : " They come , these Americans , these ignorant bushmen , to show us-the heirs of Michaelangelo and Da Vinci-how to build ! " <P> Future Dreams . The legion of sorrow became bored . The youngsters churned aimlessly around the lobby . Whenever the Duce 's name was mentioned , their eyes lit up . A young man with a slight lisp boasted : " We are getting bigger and stronger . Last month we beat up 400 leftist bastards and put 17 in the hospital . " <P> For all the impassioned oratory , the party agreed that it must proceed carefully so as not to lose its legal standing . One speaker defined the party 's task : " To dream of a perfect , serene , ideal world preceded by years of torment and contemplation of spiritual ideals . " Despite its recent gains , M.S.I , was still more notable for dreaming than action . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , you ca n't raise the dead without raising a smell . "
