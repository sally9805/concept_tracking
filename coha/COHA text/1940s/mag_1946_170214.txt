For more than 20 centuries a mass of superstitions , half-truths and prejudices have accumulated about epilepsy . Ancients thought that seizures were due to " demons , " which could be released by opening up the skull ; a latter-day legend insists that epileptics are " backward . " * Yet some of the world 's ablest men have been victims of the falling sickness : Van Gogh , Julius Caesar , Paganini , Byron , Dostoevski . <P> An estimated 600,000 people in the U.S. suffer from epilepsy ; another 10,000,000 have a predisposition to it ; and about 5,000,000 are subject to the related but socially acceptable migraine headache . The great and continuing tragedy is that epileptics , most of them normal and healthy in other respects , live under the shadow of a few cataclysmic moments which may blight their chances for success . <P> Most epileptics suffer from grand mal , the violent form of the disease in which patients often turn blue in the face , slaver and fall unconscious . Others are victims of petit mal , which most often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes exhibit convulsive twitches , occasionally fall to the ground . <P> The Treatment . The main protection against seizures has been phenobarbitol , a sedative , and more recently a non-sedative called dilantin-sodium . Other therapy : luminal , fatty ( and unpleasant ) diets , the dehydration of " wet brains , " surgery , electric shock . Last week in Chicago the American Psychiatric Society heard of two promising new drugs to combat epilepsy : tridione ( pronounced try-dye-own - TIME , Nov. 26 ) and phenantoin . <P> Dr. William Gordon Lennox , a top U.S. authority on the disease , reported " marvelous assistance " from tridione in treatment of petit mal . One of his Harvard proteges , Dr. Harry Leo Kozol , told of impressive results with phenantoin : of 104 difficult cases at Boston City Hospital , 60% had their epileptic attacks reduced 90% ; the interval between attacks was tripled . <P> Phenantoin can be administered in larger doses than dilantin-sodium or phenobarbitol ; it does not have a disagreeable taste , and can be given to babies ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallow ; its stoplight is drowsiness and not ataxia ( loss of muscular coordination ) , as in dilantin-sodium . Dr. Kozol emphasized that phenantoin is not a replacement for accepted treatments : it can be used alone or with other drugs , particularly dilantin-sodium . <P> <P> * The facts : 67% are average or above average in intelligence ; 23% are slightly below average ; only 10% are in state institutions .
