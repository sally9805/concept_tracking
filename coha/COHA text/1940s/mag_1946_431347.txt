AUGUST 1946 ANA aid Aryl GOOD HOUSEKEEPING  | In five years , " a friend of mine said , " I 'm going to retire and enjoy life . " " What are you going to do in the meantime ? " I asked . " Go on working , " he said , a little baffled . " Working a little harder than usual , I expect , knowing I 'll soon be through . " Right then and there I knew he never was going to enjoy life . His focus had been wrong for thirty years , and he did n't know how to change it . In spite of all his opportunities , he never really had enjoyed life . He had flexible hours of work , ample vacations , enough money to live more than comfortably . But he had buried himself so thoroughly in his job that he never really came up for air . Now he was focusing on that point five years hence , when he expected the whole world suddenly to become interesting to a mind too deep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never learned to play . He simply had n't learned how to live in any but a fixed pattern of routine . And @#  | he was n't doing anything about that situation now . When industry was using retirement of older workers as a means of distributing jobs during the early 1930 's , I discussed retirement with personnel managers in Michigan , Pennsylvania , New York , Connecticut . The consensus was that retirement was successful ? that is , happy and healthful ? for only two kinds of worker : those who had lived active lives with outside interests , and those who thoroughly disliked their jobs . They said frankly that their best workers , those who immersed themselves in their jobs . were poor risks , humanly speaking , for retirement . Without their jobs they lost interest in life , sometimes lived only a few years . Just before the recent war a doctor friend of mine in Colorado told me he was going to retire and turn over his private hospital to his son , who was finishing his internship in Denver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 've been practising thirty-five years , and I 'm a tired man . We 've bought a trailer , and when Johnny takes over , we 're going to go places , talk to people , watch folks fish . I do n't care to fish , but I like to watch .  | But , " he added , " I 'm going to relax gradually . " The war came , and Johnny became an Army doctor , and Dr. Mack stayed at his job . Eleven months a year he stayed there , doing two men 's work . But one month each year he and Mrs. Mack went to Yellowstone with the trailer . His weary body and nerves had to have that rest , but those trips also fitted into his longrange plan . Johnny is home now and in charge at the hospital , and Dr. and Mrs. Mack are taking longer and more frequent trips in the trailer , seeing new places , talking to people , watching folks fish . In another year , or maybe two , he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is relaxing gradually . He knows that retirement , like a strong stimulant , should n't be gulped . ANOTHER man was less wise . At fortyfive he said he had a long rest coming to him . He quit work and made rest his sole aim . He rested for six months , and his doctor told him that another six months of it would finish him . Mind and body , he knew only one way of life ? work . When he turned his back on that , both mind and body let down . So he went back to work , in a routine , and soon recovered . He tried it again five years later , and the same thing happened . Then he said : " If I want to live , I 've got to keep going . It seems that retirement is something you 've got to learn , like a trade , and I 'm too old to learn . " A druggist with whom I went to school looked at the matter squarely and decided to try his own method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is getting away from it entirely . " I 've lived with that store for twenty years , " he says , and it 's time I made a new friend , if I 'm ever going to . Some outside interest . I 'll probably be restless as a cat , but I can go out and work on my son 's farm if it gets that bad . I think I 'd like to travel . and I 'd like to learn something about music . Maybe I can learn enough in a year to be ready to retire ten years hence . This is just a trial flight . " One of the happiest retirements I know of was that of a newspaperman who worked at a routine desk job until he was , most sixty . The retirement idea struck him in his late forties , when he got an idea for a scholarly book that would require years of research here and abroad . He scheduled his life from then on , bought a modest house , invested in annuities , and spent his vacations doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set arrived , he quit his job , went abroad , did the research he had planned , and then returned to his own house . Before he had finished that first book , he had another on his hands demanding to be written . He will be happily busy to the end of his days . My friend who wants to retire " and enjoy life " is starting too late and in the wrong direction . He does n't know where he is going or what he will do if he ever gets there . He has n't even the vague goal of a boy playing hooky from school . The boy knows , from previous excursions , where to swim or fish or lie in the sun and listen to the oriole 's song . My friend never learned that you do n't retire to get away from something ; you retire to go to something . Retirement succeeds only if it enables you to enjoy more of the life you already know is worth living .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
