" An area of agreement has been reached , " said the Paris reports one minute . Next minute the word was : " Complete deadlock . " The outcome of the Big Four talks at Paris was still uncertain ( see below ) , but it remained probable that the Russians wanted a limited settlement in Europe . They wanted it not because they had stopped being Communists committed to world revolution , but because Communist progress in Europe had been checked while Communist progress in Asia was rolling right along . <P> Cabled TIME 'S Paris Bureau Chief Andre Laguerre : " If any agreement comes out of this conference , it will only reflect the realities of the present position ; it will not create new realities . The fact is that in Europe the West is stronger than Russia . Either the Russians , who are usually realists , will accept that fact and make a deal favorable to the West , or they will refuse to accept it , and keep on fighting the cold war , in which case they ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our Time ? Awareness of the Russian position brought words of optimism from President Harry Truman last week ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) and Winston Churchill . Said Churchill in London : " There was a time in 1935 and 1936 when I used to hear . . . ' ancestral voices prophesying war ! ' But now I am thankful to say I do not hear those voices ... I have a growing hope that by the strength of our united civilization , and by our readiness and preparedness to defend freedom with our lives , we may avert forever the horrible vision of a third world war . " <P> These were not imprudent hopes , and they were ardently shared by all the West . Nevertheless , there were signs last week that the West must guard against overestimating Russia 's strictly limited desire for settlement . One such sign was furnished by United Nations World , a monthly magazine not officially connected with the U.N . but devoted to U.N . affairs . In an article quoted by major U.S. newspapers , the magazine said that Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West . Andrei Gromyko , explained the U.N . World , had persuaded Joseph Stalin that the U.S. did not want war and that U.S. economic aid to Russia and Eastern Europe might be forthcoming if Moscow offered a genuine demonstration of good will . The Politburo , after heated debate , had accepted the " Gromyko Plan . " <P> U.N . World claimed to know all this from certain Eastern European sources who had access to Moscow directives , but whose identity " it would be neither prudent nor proper to disclose . " <P> Heads Against the Wall ? Washington believed that the story in U.N . World was based on a plant , probably by the Polish or Czech delegation at U.N . Its purpose : to help persuade U.S. opinion that the Atlantic pact was unnecessary . The Atlantic pact is still a great concern of Russian propagandists ; a recent Krokodil cartoon showed Uncle Sam launching human torpedoes-Winston Churchill and John Foster Dulles-from a submarine labeled Atlantic Pact ( see cut ) .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
