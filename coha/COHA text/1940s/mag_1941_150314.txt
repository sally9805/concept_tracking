The citizens and editors of London grew petulant last week over what seemed to them a gross blunder in British strategy : denuding Libya to undertake a hopeless campaign in Greece . The apparent threat to the Suez Canal had them scared . " This is no diversion , " said the London Evening News . " Glossing it over with vague , official words of comfort-words which long since have lost all their par value on the public market-is mere futility . The blunt truth is that while we were sitting back easily congratulating ourselves on our triumphs over the Italians , the Germans got to work . " <P> But the brave people of London were half-informed , and their nerves were worn down by many things . They were wrong about the blunder . <P> The original British strategy in the Mediterranean was based upon , and for many months has been daringly pursued in accordance with , a fundamental theory of Winston Churchill 's . He propounded it not at his present age of 66 , but at the age of 40 , during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said then , " whether the downfall of your strongest foe can not be accomplished through the ruin of his weakest ally ; and in this connection , a host of political , economic and geographical advantages may arise and play their part in the argument . " <P> So the British went to work on Italy . Far ahead of schedule they brought about the weak ally 's ruin in North Africa-so far ahead and so brilliantly that the strongest foe was obliged to pay attention and to plan Balkan and African campaigns . Germany 's appearance on the scene revised the fundamental British strategy . <P> The new strategy in the Mediterranean was hinged on the premise that Britain could not even dream of going on to the offense against Germany until 1942 . The aim meanwhile was to use Britain 's in adequate forces in as many places as possible to delay , hamper , bother and hurt the Nazi machine as much as possible . In the colorful language of Colonel William Joseph Donovan , who talked with General Sir Archibald Percival Wavell not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wanted to make it a foothold . " <P> The gamble of Greece was taken in full knowledge of the odds-made with forces which the British hoped would be strong enough to hold the Germans , but knew were not sufficient to defeat the Army against them . The extreme hope in the Balkans was that Italy might be knocked out . The minimum hope was that a heavy cost might be inflicted on the Germans . By last week it was certain that the minimum rather than the maximum hope would be realized . The Germans had already counterattacked across Libya and developed a threat to the Suez Canal ( see p. 23 ) . They accomplished this , in spite of the British Fleet , by flying some troops to Tripoli . The British suspected that the French had helped the Germans supply their Libyan Army .
