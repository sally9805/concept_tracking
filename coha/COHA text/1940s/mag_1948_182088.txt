Just before his visit to Suchow battlefield , TIME 'S Robert Doyle had a look at North China . There Nationalist General Fu Tso-yi , with Reds north , east and south of him , was pulling back from advance positions , preparing for a last-ditch defense of Peiping and Tientsin . Doyle 's report : <P> Most of North China 's people accepted the Red threat with wizened calm . A typical point of view was shown by a note on the bulletin board of a club in Tangshan , center of the richest coal-mining region in all Nationalist China . The note read : " For sale-Hawaiian guitar , on view at the club . Keep your spirits up by playing the above . ( Signed ) Honorable Secretary . " <P> " We Will Stay . " A more common attitude was expressed by a Tangshan miner in blue dungarees , driving a donkey cart heaped with coal . " My life is now bitter , " he said . " For ten shifts I get a bag of flour . For 20 shifts I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the Reds came ? The miner snorted . " Flee ? Flee where ? To America ? " A crowd of workmen chorused their agreement . " Nothing could be much worse than our life now , " said one . " We will stay . " <P> Many , however , were already fleeing . On a train from Tientsin to Peiping , I noticed a freight train headed the other way toward the port , bearing three shiny new automobiles . A young , black-uniformed railway guard watched the cars pass . " Yu-chien-ti tu pao " ( Have-money people all run ) , he observed . <P> Next day I got ready to accompany a group of " have-money people " on a flight from Peiping to Shanghai . Under the curved roof of a windowless Quonset hut at Peiping airfield , 40 people huddled in the dim light around a tiny coal stove . A flimsy door banged open , and the airline manager poked his head in and announced that the plane was due in 15 minutes . But instead of the scheduled DC-4 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall Chinese in a long , fur-lined gown plucked off his fedora hat and rubbed a handkerchief over his shaven pate . " Ai-yah , " he groaned . <P> " I would not complain , my friend , " said the manager . " You are lucky to get out on anything . " <P> " What Next ? " After the manager had left , a group of seven elderly American women near the stove buzzed with conversation . " What next ? " said one , through the black veil pulled tightly under her chin . The others shrugged . On the first lap of a world tour , they had taken a week out to visit Peiping . " I understand Bangkok is nice , " said another hopefully . <P> A heavyset , spectacled Chinese in a black overcoat with brown fur collar separated himself from the group at the stove , and paced slowly back &; forth across the width of the hut . He talked readily . He was General Hu Chia-yi , former Mukden garrison commander . He had left Mukden on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last few days before Mukden 's fall . His force of 500 military police was the city 's only defense . What did he think of the government strategy in Manchuria ? He hesitated . " Pu-tui-ti " ( Mistaken ) , he said , and resumed his pacing .
