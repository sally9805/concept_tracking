After her farmer-husband died , Mrs. Lessie Mills , of Fort Meade , Fla. , took to babying the youngest of her five children . As a result , Jimmy Mills got to be known as " mama 's pet , " grew up so timid that he was afraid to go to bed at night unless his mother were close at hand . <P> Painfully shy , he shunned school athletics for solitary quail-shooting in the woods , sprouted too rapidly to a frail and awkward 6 ft. 2 in . <P> When Jimmy was called up for induction early in 1943 , he did not look his age , was classified 4-F because he was " immature . " Calling him up again six months later , the Army finally decided he might just about be able to stand the gaff , took him in . <P> Last week Mrs. Mills heard startling news about frail Jimmy : in Italy , 21-year-old Private James H. Mills of the infantry had won the Congressional Medal of Honor for conspicuous gallantry during his first encounter with the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had knocked out two Nazi machine-gun nests singlehanded by killing four Germans ( with five shots ) and capturing seven more . Then he had repeatedly set himself up as a decoy target while his platoon surrounded an enemy strong point and captured 22 prisoners without suffering a casualty . <P> Said Mrs. Mills : " Just think of my baby doing that .
