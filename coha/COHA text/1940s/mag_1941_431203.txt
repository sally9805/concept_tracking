THE dramas of machinery and the test tube have in the present generation seized the limelight from the classics in education . The classics are still in the schoolroom but they no longer occupy the front seat . The growing emphasis on vocational education is neither an attempt to liquidate classical learning nor surrender to inferior minds and standards . Vocational education is indigenous to life among the mechanisms and gadgets , just as schooling in the scientific method must be a part of education in a world turned topsy-turvy every half generation by the findings of the laboratory . Some students who are verbally minded can absorb the classics readily and those who can think in the symbols of science can absorb science readily ; but everyone , whether verbally minded , scientifically minded , manually minded , or with very little mind at all , needs a skill that will enable him to earn a living . Such skill , whether verbal or manual , whether predominantly intellectual or physical , can not readily be picked up to-day ; it is rarely passed on from father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and capacity for a given vocation are by no means guarantees of employment . The fact that young people are made more employable does not in any great measure make jobs where the economy of the world does not otherwise provide the incentive or means to create employment . But the possession of skill is essential , not only as a means toward bread and shelter and greater stability in job holding , but also toward the achievement of that sense of capacity which raises the self-esteem and stabilizes the character of people . These are the aims of vocational instruction . To deny them a place in the scheme of education , and a respected place , is to live among shadows . Some day the schools and colleges will recognize that all students are entitled not only to acquaintance with their cultural background but to vocational skills ? each in accordance with and to the extent of his capacities , whether they be hand , head , or machine skills , highly specialized or more general . Such recognition should come because cultural background without vocational interest and skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the relations of things and people is invariably servile . In Book I of The Laws , Plato writes : We call one man educated and another uneducated although the uneducated man may sometimes be very well educated indeed in the calling of a sea captain or of a trader or the like . But we are not speaking of education in that narrow sense . We are speaking of that other education which makes a man eagerly pursue the ideal perfection of citizenship . I cite this passage , not as authority , but because it illustrates two phases and objectives of education which are relevant and also because it presents the classical point of view of schoolmen who , in large measure , through the ages have regarded trade education as education in a " narrow sense . "  | The words I have quoted have vitality and they might have been written not by Plato twenty-four centuries ago in Greece , but by Thomas Aquinas in the thirteenth-century Papal states , or by Hutchins and Adler in Chicago to-day . For they all hallow a " higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing a mere bone of condescension to popular education in the vocational field . This is no mere matter of emphasis , nor would it be either fair or an answer to accuse these men of learning of being intellectual snobs . Rather we are presented with fundamental concepts of living and of social relationships ; and we must inquire not only into these concepts but into their relevancy and validity in the world in which we are now living . Why is the student of symbols , the reader , deemed educated and the man " very well educated indeed " in a calling or trade requiring skill of the hand and eye and decisive judgment deemed uneducated ? Why should it be assumed that the sea captain with the education of his calling and the trader with the education of his trade would not " eagerly pursue the ideal perfection of citizen-ship " ? In the Athens of Plato traders and artisans , even the great sculptors , did not share in the citizenship of the city . Citizenship meant membership in an aristocracy , a membership which entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplation . Farmers might be citizens , but by the Periclean Age many of them had become gentlemen farmers . The sea captain and the trader were foreigners , the cobbler and the artisan were slaves . The land and the capital , the leisure and the intellectual life were Greek . It was inevitable that sea captain and trader should not be deemed educated in a democracy which was democratic only within the confines of an hereditary class and in which social practice severed on class lines those who might labor from those who might think and rule , who might pursue the perfection of citizenship . When the first great rush of abstract thinking was over , after Aristotle had summed up all that was known of man and nature ( perhaps all that could be known without the willingness of thinkers to make manual effort ) , thought was devoted to piling untried fantasy on untried fantasy until its heights were reached in realms of mysticism . The ideal perfection of citizenship , which had at least a class basis in Plato , became in Plotinus , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieved through contemplation of the Good ; and in early Christian thought , by way of Plotinus , it became a faith in God and participation in the congregation of Christendom , where for centuries education was only something for the clergy and the court . Here were the elect of the elect ? for only those of the faith had grace , all others being infidels or heretics and thus ineligible to citizenship in the City of God . The great mass of believers were offered such education as was thought necessary to give them that faith which would cause them eagerly to pursue the ideal perfection of citizenship in the City of God . This education consisted of the learning of a few responses in order to participate in religious observances . Their trades they learned from their fathers or as apprentices . The elect , those who ruled from altar and throne , were taught to read and figure and sing . In England , as late as the 13th century , a man could escape the death penalty if he could read . Among the Jewish people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his problems and interests , and those of tradesman and artisan , except in so far as they presented ethical considerations , were not the problems and interests of the schools which , in Talmud and cabala and continual annotation and discussion of such work became the possession of a favored group . With the fall of the Moorish Empire in Spain and the destruction of its schools roughly the same thing occurred to  | Moslem education , which buried itself in the mosque . And among the Hindus one finds the classic example of culture and education which disregards the common things in common lives for the " higher " things of ideals and perfections and classical interests . A caste of untouchables must lead to a Buddha contemplating his navel . For so long a period had the Middle Ages consumed the classics cooked in the wine of theology , and so thoroughly had the Middle Ages digested these classics , that it came as a shock in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries to meet the animal face to face , actually to read the original Aristotle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used his eyes , the scholars annotating and disputing and the Buddhas contemplating and contemplating were in : anger of coming to resemble intellectual Tibetan lamas , searching " ideal perfection " in fantastic isolation . It was the genius of Thomas Aquinas for Christendom and Maimonides for the Jews to feel this crisis and to solve it by reconciling the rediscovered wisdom of the ancient world with the basic ideologies of their own world . Here were triumphs of synthesis which in themselves became classics to be thumbed over , annotated , becommentaried , and befootnoted , until the contemplating latter-day Buddhas beatified them in doctor 's dissertations . I am not suggesting that the classics or the civilization of former ages are not worthy of study . On the contrary , they may be useful to an understanding of the problems of the day and an illumination of the things which men have sought or which they have feared . An understanding of the classics may explain the thinking of succeeding generations , if ? and the if is important ? if the men who wrote them and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lusty , and fearful people seeking ideologies or philosophies only incidentally to obtaining satisfactions and shedding feelings of guilt . In primitive society custom was not pursued merely because it was disagreeable to change but as a ritualistic experience ; thought was not an end in itself but a prelude to action . It took civilization to raise the pattern of neuroses to a virtue for normal men , to make thought worlds real worlds , to pursue the ideal of perfection . And it took civilization to transfer from totem and departed spirit to classic and departed sage its conflicting emotions of love and hate , fear and satisfaction . When the new God , the new ideology seems to fail there is again the longing for a golden calf ? the old totem and classic . Departed spirit and sage appear to possess a power which living and familiar persons lack . II It was not the attitude of classical contemplation , but a mood of dynamic inquiry as to how the needs of men were to be met and as to what were the limits of man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days of Copernicus and Galileo , just as it had set into motion the arts , the inquiries , the political and commercial adventures of the Greek era . Buddha might not be interested in the nature of the navel he was contemplating , or in the nature of himself and the phenomenon of his contemplation . But others were . These were men who were not content only to think ; who examined themselves and others , studied the technic of thinking and what lay behind it physiologically and anthropologically , guessed at generalizations and tested and retested these . They were interested in the ways of the sea captains , in their skills as well as their voyages and cargoes ; they accepted the trader ? perhaps because the trader was taking over some of the power that had resided in the church and court . Sovereignty placed its powers behind the law merchant and science made itself of service to commerce and later to industry . In the seventeenth , eighteenth , and nineteenth centuries men educated only in " that narrow sense " took over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created knowledge and spread it as the classicists had never been capable of doing . Of course the schools did not offer " education in that narrow sense . " It took centuries to bring about the teaching of post-Aristotelian science , more centuries to introduce laboratory science ; and only in our own day has education for a vocation been introduced below the college level ( and there , except for medicine , it has been largely in the classical professions of lawyer , teacher , and clergyman ) . It is only recently that universities and secondary schools have ceased to be institutions for the select few , that sea captains ' and traders ' sons and daughters , and future mariners and grocery clerks have been able to enter such schools . In western Europe , in the United States , in the commonwealth of the British Empire , in a few other lands education has been broadening its base to include every child through childhood ? and this means children and young people of every capacity and interest , every economic group and family educational background . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with education of such catholicity . Yet this very broadening of the educational base , this expansion of opportunity for schooling ( and the concurrent enlargement of scope and diversification of program ) provides the brightest and most dynamic chapters in our history . We go to extraordinary effort and considerable expense to develop the capacities of mentally and physically handicapped children ; classic Sparta left them in the mountains to die . We take artisans into high places in our government and make men of humble origin chief men in our states ; classic Attica kept them as slaves or otherwise denied them citizenship . We cultivate the silliest little artistic talents for the joy and satisfaction and self-realization they may yield ; in Greece they were little practiced by citizens and in some forms , notably architecture and drama , they were for millennia the monopoly of the state and its religious institutions . The rapid expansion of cultural opportunity and the dynamic qualities of democracy and experimental science have inevitably diluted classical learning and altered the quality of liberal arts education through a dispersion of individual interest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political sciences , in fine arts , and in vocational subjects have taken places of equal rank with the liberal arts , have even replaced in great measure the seven liberal arts which for about two thousand years were traditional : grammar , rhetoric , dialectic , arithmetic , geometry , music , and astronomy . Logic as a tool has replaced logic as an end . As a tool it is important to experimental science ; as an end it brought sterility to nineteenth-century Anglo-American common law as it had to twelfth-century scholasticism . The question is , has this been a price worth paying ? And this question can be disposed of only by answering other questions . Do you accept the present-day diffusion of educational opportunity or are you continually weeping for the lost virginity of your classicism ? That is to say , do you accept the idea of education as a process in which everyone may train himself and be trained in the development of his capacities and the cultivation of social intercourse on a better-informed level , or do you hold fast to the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts you in a special class and gives you a membership in a caste ? III We shall return to education in a democracy , particularly in the United States . But first let us pause to consider the aberration of some current goldencalf worshippers , located not far from the stockyards of Chicago . President Hutchins of the University of Chicago , with the categories of Aris- totelian logic on his lips and the lays of ancient Athens in his heart , would make the classics the core of education . He would find a place for science , a lesser place , but to him the education of sea captain and trader is definitely education in a narrow sense , perhaps even in an unworthy sense . He would have us drive by looking into a mirror at the rear of the car rather than through the windshield . Escaping from the microscopic attitude of statistical social science ( which by all means should not be permitted to envelop one ) , he would substitute the periscopic version . A neo-Platonist , he can point to Plato , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plato believed that he could not find any greater reality except through contemplation . While purporting to be a follower of Aristotle , he does so through the reflective eyes of St. Thomas , whereas Aristotle the Platonist could accept the theory of the master but he looked long on life and nature and established his universals on the basis of his own observations , not on shadows . Neither Plato nor Aristotle had the telescope at his disposal , nor the flexible powers of electricity at hand . If they had had these things , it is not impossible that they would have viewed the universe differently , that the Greek tradition of social respectability which left handicrafts to slaves and metics would not have controlled them . No such excuse is available to Hutchins , any more than it is to the British aristocracy which fed the young of its ruling group for centuries on classics and ruled with one eye on the feudal system . It might be pointed out that one can not long look on reflections and shadows as a way of viewing life without speedily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governed by ghosts , by ancestral shades , but not progressive societies . Free of guilty feelings , they can accept and try to comprehend the past without the compulsion to propitiate or repeat it . Professor Mortimer J. Adler makes the excellent point in How to Read a Book that most people do not know how to read . If they did , he argues , they could then read the classics , they could study with the great dead teachers instead of only learning from a rehash of the great in the classrooms of the ordinary . It is a good point that reading is at best not merely an ability to understand the words on a printed page ; that a proper reading should develop an understanding of the purpose of the author , an appraisal of the success with which he achieves his purpose , and a judgment as to the relevancy of the argument of the book in the light of the reader 's other experience and knowledge . Good teachers have known this for a long time . Within the generation remedial reading technics ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading deficiencies have been developing . They have in large measure , though not entirely , been made necessary by the very circumstance of which Adler complains : that most students have not learned to read with understanding . Now why is this ? I believe it is an outcropping from the democratization of education . Formerly student bodies were composed of people who wanted to go to school ; now in the primary years , and more and more in the years of secondary schooling , young people must go to school . When the student body was small it comprised principally the children of people who already had an educational background above the average . It was not the children of the illiterate and the semi-illiterate , of the immigrant , the ditch digger , and the laundress who went to high school ? and certainly not in droves to universities . Wanting to learn rather than resisting learning makes learning easier and more certain ; and research has indicated that family educational background is at least one important factor affecting intelligence quotients ? the measure of learning facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolhouse hundreds of thousands of dull-minded children who can not be  | expected to read on a collegiate or even high school level , but who in a democracy are entitled , nevertheless , to such education as will develop their capacities . They have swamped the schools , which have failed to meet their needs , because , in the academic tradition , they have placed these dull children year after year in unequal competition with brighter children . This hodgepodge of students also interfered with the learning progress of the brighter children . But in this we have only the growing pains of democratic education which can readily be corrected by any society willing to pay the cost . Though they may not be potential classical students , those dull but otherwise normal young people are educable , as anyone who has worked with them knows ? that is to say , educable if one conceives of education as the development of individual capacities and as opening the way to individual satisfactions and social co-operation . They would be unable to master the cornucopia of great books listed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dunce cap would scarcely answer the problems of democratic living . As citizenship to-day is more inclusive than it was in the days of Plato it is difficult to see how the state can exclude its duller members from educational opportunity unless it is also prepared to exclude them from full participation in citizenship . I would not accuse the Chicago classicists of any such intention , although many another has believed in educational tests for voters . If the dull were to be deprived of their privileges as citizens either because they were dull or because they failed to absorb that picture of the culture and institutions of the state which state narcissism desired to preserve they would , with progressive rapidity , lose the competence to maintain themselves and to defend themselves , and they would gradually be pushed into becoming a class of untouchables . For if there is anything to be learned from history of human institutions it is that any group in a community deprived of rights or powers possessed by others becomes increasingly degraded and weakened , increasingly feared and hated , until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to itself . That is why the schooling of the dull members of a democracy must not be regarded as something less than education or even as a lesser or narrower education . As human enterprises develop our needs and new means for their satisfactions , the social studies and scientific and vocational education have entered the schools to challenge the monopoly held for so many centuries by the traditional liberal arts . The breakdown of this monopoly of educational content parallels ( ex post facto , it is true ) the breakdown of the monopoly of social and political control by church and aristocracy , and the monopoly of scientific knowledge by church and university ? it parallels the division of labor , the disappearance of feudalism , and the passing of static society . Recent centuries have incorporated vast spheres into our knowledge and have developed inventions which in classical days would have condemned the inventor to exile or unpleasant death as a magician ; these are now accepted as a functional part of everyday living . These spheres of knowledge and these inventions arouse the curiosity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know how and why these wizardries occur ; they want to try for themselves , and by trying they learn . At the same time doing things , trying things in school is in part compensation for the lack of a chance to do things and try things in urbanized life . Mechanized homes , mechanized farms , mechanized transportation , mechanized entertainment have transformed our social ways more than we realize . Domestic skills have atrophied , household functions which had always placed responsibilities on the family and its members no longer  | exist . The janitor , the cannery , cheap factory-made clothing , the replacements to be obtained in the five-and-ten-cent store for what is worn or broken , gas and electric stoves , mechanical refrigeration , installment buying , and many other conveniences and facilities have taken from people activities and purposes which had been a normal or even necessary part of everyday life . Those activities and purposes in themselves had educational values . It is because these daily contacts with facts and skills and responsibilities have been so drastically reduced that facts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program of schools . The old school could carry on a verbalistic program , it could limit its field principally to words , with little danger of engendering a schism between ; the world of books and the world of experience which goes beyond books . For life outside the school , domestic and social life , supplied opportunities for translating school symbols into terms of sensory experiences . Political democracy was not threatened by the frustration of hundreds of thousands of young people from whom civilization has withdrawn creative opportunities at home , and to whom it has denied opportunity for work after graduation from school . The modern school , on the other hand , must act in a world of more limited home experience , and it must teach the tool subjects ( reading , writing , and figuring ) and the cultural heritage under the shadow of post-graduate frustration for a large part of its students . Therefore schools to-day must approach education differently than the old schools did , differently even than the schools of half a generation ago did , if they are to fulfill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been too narrowly educated in the classics , the sciences , the social sciences , or even the more directly vocational subjects , if he has the teaching spark , will it matter in the long run where the point of departure may be ? Electricity , the law of real property , or the mercantile system may not afford identical ramification , but each of them may offer an avenue of culture to the teacher who is not wedded to the " dead teachers " of his specialty , and a learning situation to the student whose mind is stimulated by the particular approach . But there is no deader dog than the mishandled classics , as generations of Latin students can attest ; and there is no more vitiating intellectual effort than that which commences with a worship of past greatness and leads to regurgitative contemplation of ideas disrupted from the current of their context . IV Let us return to the opening quotation from Plato 's The Laws . In considering this quotation , suppose we omit subjective or moral judgments as to whether this or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense " or in a broad sense ; and whether the citizenship which is to be pursued is an " ideal perfection " or just citizenship . As a matter of fact , this is precisely what the age of science and the democratic state and the democratization of education have accomplished ? and it is this tendency toward detachment of educational criteria from subjective judgments , expressed by moralistic adverbs and adjectives , that the classicists fear . They neither want to surrender their subjective judgments nor to test moral judgments in situations of life , in the development of children , and the satisfaction of their needs . To concede that education for the practical is not narrower or lower education would be a concession that classical learning stands on a par with vocational training , consumer education , or laboratory science ; that the discussion of great books of science is not better than the use of the faculties of experience ? the hand and the eye , the senses and the emotions . Experience has taught us that " beauty is truth , truth beauty " only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one needs to know ? that " ideal perfec- tions " are only subjective , for they are the fabric of ideas and aspirations which are not subject to scientific proof or observation . This does not mean that such ideas and aspirations , such equation of beauty to truth , are not valid as ennobling subjective experiences and as the material for achieving educational values . But just because they are subjective they are not criteria for forming educational judgments and controlling educational practices . Because your beauty and mine are not the same your ideal perfection and mine may differ . Consequently , our truths will not prove to be identical . If education is to be regarded as basic in a dynamic democracy let us not only subject it to the test of the judgment of the past but also to the criteria of its relevancy to the age of science . The age of science and the trend to democracy have given stature to objective judgments and to the common things in the lives of all people . You can not fashion a democracy if the different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow , ideal or common , if the capacities of one group are to be satisfied and those of a less complex nature are to be ignored . Who in a democracy could make such a classification ? Would it not require a caste system which in itself would be a contradiction in modern democracy ? It may be worth while for a democracy to pay highly for the training of a technical expert , but for that reason it need not regard as less worth while the development of hundreds of untalented young people to perform unskilled tasks , to lead satisfactory lives , and to express at the polls their beliefs as to what is best for them and theirs . Industrial and mechanical development , moreover , have opened more opportunities for men and women . Not necessarily more opportunities to win fortune or power ? but certainly they have brought a multiplication of occupations , an expansion of leisure time , a transfer of accent from isolated farm to congested city , and a stimulation of imagination and necessity through advertising and entertainment . From this development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educational satisfactions that are not to be circumscribed by the needs of candidates for the ministry , the bar , and the pharmacopoeia of medicine . Indeed , we can not underscore too strongly the educational effects of our commercial culture , which convince average and subaverage people that there are new and splendid necessities which they must obtain , and offer them entertainment which flatters them with introductions to the fictional grandeurs of the screen and the periphery of the fine arts . And these educational effects call in turn for schooling that is not divorced from them , which does not close its eyes to the educational processes of life beyond the schools . The products of mass production may not be works of art and the entertainment of the masses may not be of classical standard ? but there they are , plus the political power of millions to insist that the things they live by and enjoy shall be given respectability and vitality in their lives , that they shall be taught to use and appreciate them . Moreover , an economic system , whatever it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adaptability in consumption . It is one of the tasks of schools ( whether or not they are conscious of it ) to develop those skills and foster such adaptability in the maintenance of a thriving economy . Thus the novelty of to-day must illuminate the lesson of to-morrow . It is certain that all state-maintained schooling aims at education in the duties of citizenship as well as its privileges , showing how the former are to be performed and the latter realized . Every state seeks to assure its longevity by continuance of its ideals and customs . Propaganda of the political and economic faith of the dominant groups of the state ( narrow groups in autocratic states , broader groups as democratization is realized ) is the long-term technic to this end . And schooling which aims to  | perpetuate such ideals and customs has come to be the primary long-term institution for this propaganda of faith . But with democracy there has been introduced not merely a public school of a narcissistic culture seeking its political and economic immortality . In that school ? perhaps because the interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narcissism has expanded ? people have demanded to be taught not only the generalities of citizenship and the political and economic world , but specifically the realities of their own functioning in their own environment . Men and women in democratic lands have come to accept Jefferson 's , not Plato 's , objective of education : " To give to every citizen the information he needs for the transaction of his own business . " It is this impact of the scientific age , this humanism of democracy , that the classicist fails to appreciate . Like the scientist , he starts with the a priori idea , the feeling , the intuition ; unlike the scientist , he embellishes it with some reason and more feeling but fails to give it objective valuation . He is sure of his criteria . Beauty tends to be truth to him absolutely , not in a relative sense , not as it springs from new experience or the satisfaction of individual impulses . Such absolutism was relevant to the work of St. Thomas Aquinas , who was demonstrating the philosophic validity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German philosophy and its Marxian offspring , which again are phrased in authoritarian idioms . But neither scientific nor democratic thinking can by its very nature be absolute . The one can not evade exceptions which prove new rules , nor the other avoid variations inherent in mankind , and remain science or democracy . Neither science nor democracy can find release in the paternal protection of certainties ; but it is this very need for dependent thought and action , the search for protective certainty , which has thrown faltering peoples into the arms of dictators , has encouraged them to find in father-fantasies the hope of security . The intellectual phase of this neurosis is to be found in present-day classicism . For classicism that is unrelieved by objective experiment , thought that is unrelated to eye and hand , have become again and again through the years retreats for neurotic scholarship , escapes for him who sees daring in an asterisk and finds immortal security in a footnote.  |                    @
