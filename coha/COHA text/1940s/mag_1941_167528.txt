Scientific solutions from last week 's University of Chicago meetings : <P> &gt; Why do plants bloom faster when their flowers are picked ? The dominant bud , explained Plant Physiologist John William Mitchell of the U.S. Department of Agriculture , apparently produces a hormone which inhibits growth of the other buds on the same stem . If it is snipped off , the uninhibited buds can burst into bloom . <P> &gt; Why are there evergreens in the South , oaks in the North ? Botanist William Spinner Cooper of the University of Minnesota studied fossil tree pollens in peat , concluded that " in America the climate following the glacial epoch was warm and dry , with a return to a cooler moister climate during the last few thousand years . " Thus the cone-bearing evergreens of the Southern U.S. are relics of the glacial invasion ( which halted at the Ohio River ) , and the North 's oaks and other hardwoods are relics of the warm postglacial period . <P> &gt; " Why is rubber so elastic ? " asked Physicist Eugene Guth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baffled scientists for a long time and it was not until recently that an explanation could be offered . . . . A property of rubber , not well known , can easily be demonstrated with a rubber band . Stretch it quickly against the upper lip . It feels warm . Conversely , if it is kept stretched for a little while , then released , it feels cool . This generation of heat by the band . . . proves that the relation between the heat of the rubber and its compression is similar to that of gas compressed by a piston in a vessel . If the gas is kept at a constant volume . . . the pressure on the piston will increase proportionately with the temperature . " <P> On the mechanism of rubber elasticity . Physicist Guth said : " The molecules of rubber are like long flexible strings . . . . If one throws a flexible string into the air , it will land in a curved , coiled-up form , rather than a straight form . Similarly , in an unstretched rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stretching the rubber actually stretches its long flexible molecules from the curved to the straight form . "
