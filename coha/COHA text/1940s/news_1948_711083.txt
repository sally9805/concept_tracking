txt THE TREASURY EYES with suspicion sertain types of stock dividends , especially those of closely controlled corporations . Stock dividends are non-taxable unless they change the proportionate interest of the shareholders in the company . For instance , if company declares a 100% dividend on common stock in common stdck , all it does is give each holder another piece of paper evidencing ownership . Each stockholder 's equity remains the same . Similarly , if a company with only common stock pays a dividend in new preferred . this ordinarily would be a non-taxable transaction since there would be no change in proportionate ownership . However , Treasury experts believe such stock dividends may sometimes be used to give stockholders an indirect cash dividend . If paid in cash , a dividend is fully taxable . The Treasury has been working for some time on the problem , but conclusions so far have been general . Each case will be treated on its merits . ? ? ? THE BUSINESS PURPOSE of each dividend distribution will be scrutinized . Stock dividends usually are paid for sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its shares . This would normally follow the issuance of more shares which would reduce the market price . Or the company might want to give its stockholders , in effect , a pledge of larger dividends while retaining cash for business needs . But where there is no apparent business purpose or benefit to the company from the dividend distribution , it may be challenged as an indirect cash dividend . HERE 'S A CASE that 's almost certain to be held equivalent to a cash distribution . The " XYZ Corp .. - with only common stock . distributes a dividend of 10,000 shares of new 1.100 par preferred . The stockholders at once , or reasonably soon after , sell this stock to an insurance company at $105 a share . If the dividend were non-taxable , they would be taxed only on the profit from the sale . $50,000 . This would be a long term capital gain subject only to a 25% levy ( 50% of half the gain ) . The stockholders would thus get $1.037,500 cash ( $1,050,000 for sale of the stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get $12.500 and the company nothing . In such a case the Treasury would almost certainly allege that , for the corporation , there was no , businisss purpose . Where there as a sale , or evidence of intent to sell the stock issued as a dividend , the commissioner of internal revenue is expected to hold that the whole transaction is a legal fiction designee to funnel off cash to stockholders . The dividend would therefore be fully taxable . He is expected to take the same position when a company issuing a stock dividend reserves the right to redeem the stock within a short time or sets up a sinking fund for this purpose . ? THE SUPREME COURT has made it plain that mere adherence to legal form is not enough to make a transaction tax free . It looks at the reasons for and results of a transaction as well as its form . In its drive against stock dividends which it considers substitutes for cash , the Treasury will rely largely upon High Court decisions in the case of J. Robert Basely and also in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basely owned all but one of the 1,000 shares of J. Robert Basely , Inc . The company recapitalized in 1939 . It gave stockholders five shares of new no-par stock for each $100 par share . It also created a $400.000 issue of bonds which were given to stockholders . The bonds were callable at any time at the company 's option . The Adams case was somewhat similar , although the company 's surplus was not reduced by the reorganization as in the Basely case . The Third Circuit Court of Appeals held that only reorganizations " required by business exigency " or " undertaken for reasons germane to the continuance of the corporation " qualified for tax exemption . The Supreme Court , in upholding the decision , denied tax free privileges to a reorganization " which is merely a vehicle , however elaborate or elegant , for conveying earnings from accumulations to the stockholders . " Treasury experts believe the courts will hold , similarly , that stock dividends which merely convey cash to stockholders are taxable . ? ? ? ADVERTISERS MAY USE institutional advertisements and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-will ) . advertising was permitted during the war as a deductible business expense . Companieffewhich devoted all their activities to war work and had no commercial goods to sell thus kept their names before the public To qualify for tax exemption , expenditures had to be reasonable ? based on past advertising outlay . the needs of new products , increased advertising costs and similar factors . With the war over manufacturers wondered if such advertising would still be acceptable for tax purposes . Edward 1 . , deputy commissioner of internal revenue , recently told a congressional committee the bureau would not attempt to define what form of advertising a corporation must employ . ? ? ? LOCAL INCOME TAXES may yet become an important source of revenue for cities and municipalities . Philadelphia was the first city to impose such a levy , in 1940 . In the past two years several other towns have followed suit . The City of Brotherly Love has found the tax an increasing source of revenue . Last year receipts reached nearly $27.8 million , a new record . Since February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city has garnered a tote. ? of $180.4 million from its earned income levy That averages nearly $2 million a month .
