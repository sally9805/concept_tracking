Up in Central Park ( book by Herbert &; Dorothy Fields ; music &; lyrics by Sigmund Romberg &; Dorothy Fields ; produced by Michael Todd ) is a period musical about Manhattan that attempts to graft the nefariousness of the Tweed Ring onto the nostalgia of Currier &; Ives . The grafting practiced by Boss Tweed and his Tammany henchmen ( who " spent " $7,500 on two thermometers and $3,852,196.75 on carpets for the County Courthouse ) was , while it lasted , considerably more successful . Pictorially delightful , with gay costumes , ruddy skating scenes , and stylish and evocative sets by Howard Bay , Up in Central Park is theatrically more than a trifle dull . <P> It is not that the show has nothing to offer but atmosphere . Composer Romberg ( Maytime , Blossom Time ) has contrived a tuneful if reminiscent score , nicely sung by pretty Maureen Cannon and Wilbur Evans . Choreographer Helen Tamiris has fashioned some pleasant and unhackneyed dances . Herbert &; Dorothy Fields have walked right up to Boss Tweed with a courage rare in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of horse- &-carriage; days , badly lacks pace . It equally lacks variety-the songs , dances , Central Park vignettes keep striking the same note . Most of all it lacks humor : Tweed and his gang , who could have been rollickingly lampooned in the style of The Beggars ' Opera , stomp around with the authors ' sober research still clinging to them like burrs . <P> Much gayer than the show were enterprising Producer Todd 's opening-night flourishes . He invited critics to drive to the theater ( itself opposite Central Park ) in broughams and barouches . After the curtain fell , first-nighters clambered into tallyhos and victorias , drove along the Park 's snowy , moonlit paths to its brightly lighted Tavern-on-the-Green . There hundreds of guests made merry on champagne &; caviar at what New York 's onetime playboy mayor , Jimmy Walker , dubbed the greatest party " since the days of Diamond Jim Brady .
