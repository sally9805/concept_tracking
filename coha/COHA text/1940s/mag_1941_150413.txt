At the time of Imperial Rome , in a sacred grove by Lake Nemi in the green Alban hills was a hoary oak . Around it day &; night prowled a grim , wary figure with sword in hand . He was Diana 's priest and the King of the Wood . He was also a murderer . He had succeeded to the priesthood by first plucking from the sacred oak a branch of mistletoe , the golden bough , then by slaying his predecessor . And in turn he would grow weak or unwatchful and himself be slain . <P> In Cambridge , England , last week died an old , old man whose work had left a lasting mark on science , literature and the history of Western thought . Those who put on mourning for Sir James Frazer could well reflect that doing so was a reversion to primitive custom , when survivors dressed in black so that returning ghosts might not find them and do mischief . For it had been Frazer 's lifelong task to collect the magic , myth and folk lore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encyclopedia , The Golden Bough , one of the 20th Century 's most influential books . <P> James George Frazer was born in Glasgow in 1854 on New Year's- the day when Bohemian rustics fire guns into the air to frighten witches away ; the day when Scotsmen once ran clamorously sunwise around their houses to assure a twelve month 's bounty . At Cambridge he became a scholar of classical literature , a fellow of Trinity College . In Virgil he first found mention of the golden bough . He spent his life writing an interminable footnote on the passage . <P> Why , asked Frazer , did this priesthood of the oak grove devolve by mortal combat ? And why did the challenger first have to wrest a bough from the sacred oak ? Stepping into the sacred grove at Nemi , Frazer soon found himself lost in a vast , darkling forest of folk rites and superstitions which covered the whole planet . <P> In time he dimly perceived that the oak was identified with the sky god , hurler of lightnings , and the golden mistletoe contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which yearly rekindled the sun , and it was the seat of the mystery of fire . As Frazer 's eyes opened , he realized that the sacrificial succession of priest-kings represented the annual death and resurrection of the vegetable world , the prime phenomenon of nature . The mystery of the golden bough was at heart the mystery of all sacrificed gods-Adonis , Attis , Osiris , Odin , the Aztec Texcatlipoco - and the mystery too of still higher religions . <P> The Golden Bough first appeared in 1890 as one slim volume , waxed into a sturdy 12-volume series by 1915 , proliferated riotously until at Frazer 's death his work filled some 284 books . Husky and bearded , he worked ten or twelve hours a day for 60 years . He explored primitive magic , tree worship , the divinity of kings , taboo , human sacrifice , the scapegoat , fertility rites , myths , festivals of fire . Into his chapters he crowded allusions to the Sioux , Bushmen , Greeks . Eskimos . Samoans , Saxons , Babylonians and dozens of other peoples . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Frazer 's pioneering and his endless heaping up of source materials make The Golden Bough and its offshoots the world 's greatest work of cultural anthropology .
