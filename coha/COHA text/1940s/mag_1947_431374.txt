 | In observance of the centennial of the birth of Alexander Graham Bell , inventor of the telephone , on 3. 1947 , the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE presents this story of the Bell Telephone Laboratories , carry on the work that Dr. Bell began . Dr. Bell was one of the original members of the National aphic Society when it was founded in 1888 . While President of The Society , 1898 to 1903 , he initiated extension of its membership and the popularization of its Magazine . He contributed to the NATIONAL , RAPHIC MAGAZINE and served as a trustee of The Society until his death in 1922 . Mrs. Bell and her s- gave The Society its first building , Hubbard Memorial Hall , in memory of Gardiner Greene Hubbard , President of the Bell Telephone Company and first President of the National Geographic Society .

" How Alexander Graham Bell , born in Scotd 100 years ago , March 3 , 1847 , would have joiced at " visible speech " ! He was origilly a teacher of the deaf , and it was his est for better means of teaching them to ak that led him to invention of the teleone ( page 282 ) . Bell himself once tried ' th only modest success to work out a milar idea as an aid in teaching his deaf pils to utter sounds properly . Though not yet ready for general use , modern " visible speech " has great possibilities . Deaf people can and have learned to read it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are saying . Hooked on to a telephone or radio , it would serve the same purpose , though that is still in the future . Teaching the Deaf to Speak Better still , deaf people can use it to improve their speech , a difficult task normally for those who are deaf from birth or early childhood , for they are unable to hear the proper pronunciation of words and their speech is likely to be harsh and unnatural . With " visible speech " they can practice by watching the patterns of their voices on the screen and comparing them with patterns of normal speech , until they learn to speak correctly . Its use in teaching deaf children to speak is now being carefully studied by specialists at the University of Michigan . All the " miracles " of telephone engineers have come from the study of electric waves , which are among the most sensitive and temperamental things in the Universe . the Telephone 275 Electric waves used in the telephone have only about one-millionth of the power that lights the electric lamp beside your chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear over thousands of miles of wire or through the air as radio waves , passing them safely through millions of connections and relays , and doing it always better and faster , is the main task of Bell Laboratories men . In doing that job , they have reached out through 93 million miles of space to study the sunspot cycle and to learn to forecast the showers of electrified particles from the sun that periodically disrupt radiotelephone channels across the oceans . They have probed into the mysteries of how electrons , dancing inside the atoms of a copper wire , transmit the energy of speech from one end of the wire to the other . Bell men 's problems are never-ending and ever new . Inside the mouthpiece of your telephone , for instance , behind the little holes that you talk into , a thin diaphragm of duralumin is vibrated by the energy of your voice . To protect it from rust-producing moisture , it used to be covered with a membrane of oiled silk . But cigarette and cigar ash , mixed with the moisture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposit that ruined the oiled silk . So Bell men worked up a synthetic rubberized protector that is impervious to that caustic action . They 've developed a paint for telephone operators ' chairs that wo n't snag the girls ' stockings or rub off on them . They 've raised termites to find out what those pernicious insects do n't like to eat , to help find a preservative for telephone poles in termite-infested country . In the process they discovered that termites will pine away , refuse food , and even digest themselves if their colony is disturbed . Maybe that will be some comfort to you if you have termite trouble ! They have a movie camera in which the film runs 70 miles per hour , taking up to 8,000 pictures a second , to slow down the movement of fast-acting automatic switches to see just how they work , or why they do n't .

Constantly delving into endless secrets , solving countless problems , searching for knowledge that will be useful in ways as yet unknown , Bell Laboratories is typical of the many great industrial research institutions of the United States which have helped give this country its high standard of living and its leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Make Your Telephone Work To tell all the things that Bell men do would take up volumes of this MAGAZINE , but a few examples will give you an idea . Consider the coal in your telephone . Yes . coal about 50,00 finely crushed granules of it , in a pea-sized box just behind the diaphragm inside the mouthpiece ( Plate IV ' . Through these bits of coal flows the current that carries your voice over the wire . Coal is used because it 's carbon , and carbon is not only a good conductor but quite elastic . As your voice vibrates the diaphragm , pressure of the granules against each other changes the area where they touch . That varies its resistance to the curren passing through , a translates your volt waves into waves o electric current . .

That thin layer of carbon works just as as the solid carbon of the little lumps of and , unlike real coal , its quality can be trolled and never varies . Eventually " synthetic coal " may be in your telep making it work even better than now , lasting longer , too . Metal Is Rolled to Calling-card Thinness Walter S.

Heart of each filter is one or more quartz crystals , each of which vibrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filter lets through only the one conversation to which it is tuned . Those crystals are made from a special grade of quartz found almost exclusively , in Brazil . That brings up the story of how Bell scientists actually " improved on Nature " and made artificial crystals better for some purposes than the natural Brazilian kind . Those artificial crystals played a big part in helping to win World War II . When German submarines began sinking Allied vessels wholesale , the Navy issued an urgent call for a device better than those then in use for locating submarines under water . Best way to locate a submerged submarine is to send out sound waves through the water which strike its hull and bounce back to their source . When converted into electrical waves , they reveal the distance and location of the submarine . To convert the sound waves into electrical waves precisely enough to locate a submarine accurately , the best method is to use crystals which vibrate at a very precise frequency . Crystals of natural quartz had some limitations for the purpose and also were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a better way to do the job . Bell men saved the day with artificial crystals .

He Talks to a Man " in a Distant Place " The inventor of the telephone , in 1892 , opens long-distance service between New York and China over 800 miles of open wire line .

The Bell men began the same way , but instead of ordinary salt they used a chemical solution that contained ammonia , hydrogen , and phosphoric acid . They evaporated a little of it , and what they had left was a small crystal . This was too rough and imperfect to use in submarine detectors , but it served as a " seed " to build larger and better crystals . If you revolve a crystal seed in a tank full of the chemical solution , more of the chemicals will come out of the solution and deposit on the seed ( Plates XII and XIII i . Gradually a large , clear synthetic crystal is built up . When it 's large enough you take it out , cut off the good part , and use the seed over again to build another crystal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built in almost the same way that Nature makes quartz crystals .

They helped clear the seas for the troopships and cargo vessels that made possible the successful Allied invasion of the Continent . Later , American submarines used sonar to hunt down Japanese ships . Now that the war is over , artificial crystals are still being made , because the large sizes needed in filters in the telephone system are rarely found in natural quartz , even if there were enough quartz , which is doubtful . Another example of how little things helped win the war is the story of the molecules of gold . In all the countless radio sets in airplanes , tanks , command cars , ships , and gun batteries , crystals of natural quartz were u to select out the different wave lengths which these radios operated . To make a crystal vibrate at a certain i quency , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to cut crystal to certain exact dimensions . achieving just the right thickness to pick the higher radio frequencies is too delicate job to do accurately with tools . That 's where the molecules of gold came Bell scientists cut their crystals an infinites amount off the required thickness . Then , heating a tiny bit of gold , vapor was bo off from it and deposited on the crystal in layer a few molecules thick , until the cry was altered to produce just the right frequen 288 The National Geo  | Not long ago a man riding in an automobile in Washington , D. C. , picked up a telephone on the dashboard and talked to his wife in England , learning , incidentally , that their grandson had had his first tooth . That was a demonstration of the new mobile radiotelephone service which is rapidly being put into ise in large cities and on major highway routes in this country ( Plate III ) . With this service you have in your car a telephone with its own number . If you are a salesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the boss may want to tell you right away about a new good prospect for a sale . He merely calls your car telephone number , the call goes by wire to a radiotelephone station , then through the air to your car . A bell rings and a light flashes on your dashboard . You pick up the phone and carry on a conversation . Later , if you want to call the boss to tell him you put over the deal , you can call him direct from the car . If you 're out on the road between New York and Philadelphia , the boss can get you by calling long distance , giving your car telephone number , and saying he thinks you 're about 20 miles south of Newark . The toll operator routes the call through the radiotelephone station that is nearest to that locality . If you do n't answer , she tries the next station on down the road . You can see this system 's usefulness for salesmen , police , doctors , buses , newspapers , delivery trucks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineer on a moving train also will be possible . Eventually , you may be able to talk this way from one train to another in different parts of the country or even of the world , and probably between passenger planes and the ground . Just delivering your voice anywhere you want it sent , over the existing maze of American telephone wires , is a big enough job . To transmit a human voice over the telephone , you need first to know how the voice works and what it can do , and to make it heard at the other end you need to know how the ear works and what it can and can not hear . Alexander Graham Bell , in one of his early experiments , sang songs into a human ear obtained from a medical school . He attached a thin straw to the inner part of the ear , fixed so one end rested against a plate of smoked glass . When he sang into the ear , the sound waves set up by his voice vibrated the eardrum , and the straw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way he obtained a picture of sound waves that helped in his invention of the telephone . You can still see those old glass plates with the wavy lines on them , preserved at the Bell Laboratories ( page 281 ) . Today Bell scientists are still experimenting with the human ear . Between 20 and 40 thousand nerve fibers connect the ear to the brain . These nerves , telling the brain what the ear hears , form the last link in the process of transmitting the voice over the telephone . New knowledge of deafness and what to do about it also has come from these studies of the human ear . A device to measure the hearing of a whole roomful of school children at once was developed by Bell scientists . The children listen to a series of numbers spoken with steadily diminishing loudness , and write them down as long as they can hear them . The last number written indicates the degree of the child 's deafness , if any . These tests , now widely used in schools , have shown that one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work by some degree of permanent or temporary deafness . One Person in 10 Is a Little Deaf The hearing of more than half a million people was tested in the same way at the New York and San Francisco world 's fairs of 1939-40 , the first tests ever made of the hearing of a large cross section of the population . Results showed that one in every 10 persons is deaf to some degree , but that some people have supernormal hearing . Speaking , of course , is just as important as hearing in the telephone system . It begins with the larynx , which contains the vocal cords . They really are not cords but two curtainlike membranes , in your throat behind your Adam 's apple , that vibrate when you talk . Seeking to learn how the vocal cords wor to see if the telephone transmitter was pr erly designed to handle the sounds that t cords give out , Bell Laboratories scienti took the first high-speed movies ever made the vocal cords in action ( Plate II ) . Peo used to think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , run in sl motion , showed that they really have a of wavelike action , somewhat like clo flapping on the line on a windy day . From the movies they learned , too , sound comes from the vocal cords in p Since the telephone was already designed handle this type of energy properly , no chan were needed . The movies revealed that person with a well-trained voice keeps vocal cords closed until air pressure is b up in the chest and expelled strongly . In person with an untrained voice the cords open most of the time .  | Women 's vocal cords are shorter than men 's , this is the reason why their voices are : er-pitched . Opera singers have had their ? il cords photographed by the Bell people , - fforts to improve their performance . Docare using the high-speed camera to photo : ) h diseased vocal cords . First step in making a telephone work ht is getting your voice into it , " one of the 11 engineers told me . " That 's not as simple it seems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavities of your mouth and oat and are shaped by your teeth , tongue , late , and lips . " About half the sounds you utter are made ' thin the mouth , the other half coming from e vocal cords . When the sounds come out your mouth , they billow and eddy all ound your head , besides traveling straight rward . To find out how the voice behaves and how is transmitted , we use an artificial voice which reproduces all typical voice tones ( Plate Il ) . We found that our efforts to make voices more understandable over the telephone tended to reduce naturalness , and so we try to strike a happy medium . The human voice ranges over about five or six octaves , but not more than about four octaves need to be transmitted over the telephone for good hearing . To transmit the other octaves would be unnecessarily expensive and complicated . Artificial Voices at Work Incidentally , we have artificial voices ) rking regularly as part of the telephone system . Sometimes from a dial telephone you may call a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls ; so , when you turn the dial , it starts an artificial voice speaking , and this repeats aloud in the operator 's headset the number you have dialed . This is done with numbers recorded on sound movie film , and the dial system selects the numbers to be played . ' " To do its job well , the telephone mouthpiece should be right in front of the mouth , and the receiver end of the handset should be right by your ear . That means the handset has to be just about the proper length to reach from the average ear to the average mouth . The connecting piece has to fit around the face . We measured hundreds of human heads , big and little , fat and thin , male and female , to design a handset that fits them all . " How many times have you dropped your telephone on the floor ? How many times in a year do you bang it down on the hook when you finish talking or get a busy signal ? Not long ago a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the head with her telephone when he tried to stop her from calling the police . It did n't break . " We make the handset tough by baking the plastic with an electronic process that generates heat inside the material , heating it equally all the way through . On a testing machine we can bang down a handset on the hook enough times in 24 hours to duplicate the wear it gets in 40 years of use " ( page 314 ) . Why is it hard to understand women ? That , too , is a problem for Bell Laboratories men . It 's not a matter of " advice to the lovelorn " or trying to figure why ladies change their minds . It 's why women are somewhat harder to understand over the telephone than men . The answer is that higher-pitched female voices disturb the inner membrane of the ear in only half as many places as the lower voices of men . The higher frequencies of their voice tones are not heard because the ear is less sensitive to them . Yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you telephone today in any goodsized city , your voice is directed to its destination by a mechanical brain that works faster and in many ways better than any human brain ever could ( Plate X ) . This " brain " is part of the " dial system , " developed in its present form by Bell Laboratories engineers . When you pick up the telephone and start to turn the dial wheel , the " brain " goes into action . First it notes the number you 're calling , which is , say , Elmhurst 6-6352 . Then it hunts through the maze of telephone channels for a clear route from your own exchange to Elmhurst . It sets controls to keep that route clear , connects you to Elmhurst , finds the terminal of the 6352 line , connects you to it , and then drops out to handle another call , all in a matter of seconds . If in setting up a call the " brain " runs into trouble in getting through , it turns on a set of lights to show where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief 's office . Relays Run the Dial " Brain " Electrical relays play a large part in making the dial " brain " work . A relay may have as many as 60 electrical contacts which can open and close much as you open and close your thumb and forefinger . Part of each relay is an electromagnet made of a coil of wire wound on an iron core . When current flows through the coil of wire , the iron becomes a magnet and pulls the " thumbs and fingers " of the relay together . Current then can flow through and on to another relay , where it activates another magnet , thus closing another contact ; and so on .  | No Man Left the Ground to Build Dr. Bell 's Tetrahedral Tower at Baddeck Wanting a lookout on his mountaintop , he invented this type of construction using tetrahe cells . Two legs of the tower were constructed on the ground from %-inch pipe and joined together . the third leg was built and jacked up , the tower was hoisted until erect . The 84-foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The inventor is buried here overlooking the Bras d'Or La When all the relays between you and the number you 're calling are closed , the current carrying your voice can travel all the way through . When you hang up , the current stops flowing , the relays spring open and are ready to handle another call . On an average call in the latest type of dial system about 5,000 such contacts operate to make the connection . Each contact is really a pair of bars only 1/16 of an inch long . When the thumb and finger of the relay close , those two bars must meet firmly . If a single relay fails to close , or to spring open again when the call is ended , or if the two contacts do not touch properly , or are worn , or dirty or tarnished , trouble will result . Relay contacts used to be made of platinum , because , like all precious metals , it does not tarnish and will not melt under the heat generated by current passing through it . But platinum is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when foreign supplies may be cut off . So engineers developed a contact of palladi another precious metal , also tarnish-proof much less costly than platinum . But dirt may collect even on palladiu Dirt on a contact interferes with smooth p sage of current and may stop its flow entirely This puts unwanted noise in the telephone may even make it go dead . In their intensi war on dirt , Bell scientists have taken dust contacts and analyzed particles of it weitzh as little as 24 millionths of an ounce . They 've had to deal with cotton lint bl o on contacts from a near-by laundry ve lator , and with gases and smoke part ' present in the air in some industrial ci To cut down this kind of trouble , air is flit before it enters the rooms where dial " br are working . As a further safeguard , contacts now built in twin arrangements so that , if p 300 In " Visible Speech , " the Words " National Geographic Society " Take This Form With an apparatus developed by Bell Telephone Laboratories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read . They form lines and shadows of varying shape and intensity which represent not letters but sounds . Note the similarity of the patterns made by the short " A " sounds in " National " and " Geographic . " Music , bird songs , and noises also can be made into visible patterns . spoils the working of one pair , the other can handle the entire load of current . By cutting down the size of contacts , the cost of the twin arrangement has been made less than that of the former single contacts . Today the dial brain is even handling many long-distance calls . A man in Philadelphia , calling a Richmond , Virginia , number , gives the number to the Philadelphia toll operator . She dials a code number that connects her with Richmond and then dials the Richmond number direct from Philadelphia . This method is already in use in several large cities and eventually will be extended over the whole United States . Giving Your Voice a Boost Electrical energy rapidly dies away as it travels along a wire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the current , the faster it dies . In some cases it may die away to one millionth of its starting energy in only seven or eight miles ! In Alexander Graham Bell 's day people used to speak loudly to overcome this loss on local calls , but on a transcontinental call that would n't help . In old times they used wire as thick as a pencil to cut down the loss , but with the number of telephone lines in use today such wire would be outrageously costly . Bell Laboratories men overcame that hurdle with the vacuum tube amplifier , or repeater , which in effect takes the faint dying whisper of your speech and turns it into a mighty shout that carries as far as the next amplifier . On a typical New York to San Francisco call it takes about 180 repeaters , spaced every 16 miles , to boost your voice along , like a series of men on mountaintops , each one hearing the faint call of the man to the east and bellowing it on to the next man to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die away too much before amplifying it , however , for then it gets fainter than the noise of the electrons eternally dancing inside the circuits which carry your voice . Then , when you amplify , you amplify the noise , and the voice is lost in the vastly magnified roar of those dancing electrons , which otherwise no human ear ever hears . Amazing as it may seem , on a cross-country call voice tones echo back along the wire from the other end of the line , a real transcontinental echo . Even though your voice travels thousands of miles a second along a wire , there is sufficient time lag so that the man on the other end hears both you and your echo . a kind of confusing double talk . Bell men finally licked the echo with a device that stops it from returning while you 're talking . Ever since Alexander Graham Bell telephoned his first sentence over a wire between two rooms in 1876 , telephone talk has traveled over ordinary parallel wires . But today su wires can not do the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your voice . One of th is the new coaxial cable , consisting of seve hollow tubes with a single thick wire ins each tube .

With " visible speech " they can compare patterns made by their . ices with those of correctly pronounced words until the two match . In a similar way the device can used for teaching pronunciation of foreign languages ( page 273 ) . studied by Bell men . They are experimenting with very short electric waves vibrating billions of times per second . Such waves wo n't stay on wires . They must either be shot off into space as radio waves or captured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipe . Some day these extremely short waves may be carrying hundreds or even thousands of telephone conversations at the same time , each on its own wave length , without interfering with each other , over a single electrical pathway . Television , too , is coming more and more to the fore . Television can be broadcast through the air only a few miles around each broadcasting station . To travel any distance it must be carried over some kind of channel or pathway , and the telephone system provides a network to do this ( Plate XV ) . But , to transmit a television picture , you must transmit almost instantaneously all the degrees of light , shadow , and perhaps color in each of several hundred thousand different parts of the picture , and do it all over again 30 times each second . It takes a broad band of frequencies to do this job , and such a broad band can not travel more than a short distance over ordinary telephone wires . Telephoning Without Wires So new kinds of telephone pathways , which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well , are coming into use . One is the coaxial cable , already mentioned , with its hollow tubes or pipes with a thick wire inside each . Through such a cable , using six different tubes at once , you can send 1,000 telephone conversations and several television programs , all at the same time . Another new kind of telephone pathway is radio-relay , which uses a tight , straight , pencilshaped beam of very short radio waves instead of wires or cables . These waves are largely free from static . Bell engineers see the time when many hundreds of telephone conversations or as many as half a dozen or more television programs may be sent over this beam at the same time . Radio-relay uses short radio waves that travel in straight lines and , unlike longer waves used in broadcasting , do not follow around the curvature of the earth . Beyond the horizon these short waves go off into space ; so , in order to transmit them any distance along the earth 's surface , they must be picked up at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again to the next horizon . Thus they move in a series of short jumps between towers on mountaintops or other high points . Radio-relay is now being installed by Bell engineers between New York and Boston . A radio-relay network eventually may spread all over the country , supplementing longdistance telephone cables . Still another new kind of telephone pathway , a revolutionary new way of transmitting electricity , is the " wave guide , " which is really just a hollow pipe . Electric waves travel through it like sound waves through a speaking tube . It can handle very short waves that would  | In a Characteristic Pose , Dr. Bell Plays with a Grandson On the porch of the Bell summer home at Baddeck , Nova Scotia , the inventor entertains the boy by ausing " an earthquake , " collapsing his knees suddenly . Dr. Bell is survived today by two daughters , Mrs. Gilbert Grosvenor and Mrs. David Fairchild , nine grandchildren , and 19 great-grandchildren. , luickly die away in a wire : so someday , using such waves , it may be possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one time and many television programs . Some time , perhaps , wave guides may be used for long-distance telephoning , supplementing present-day cables , so that your voice would be " piped " to its destination instead of " wired . " As electric waves come out of the end of a wave guide , they can be focused by a special metal lens so that they form a narrow , tight jet or beam , just as a glass lens focuses a searchlight beam . You can aim that beam to hit something , or move it around to find something , as you would a searchlight beam . Talking over a Radio Beam Such a beam is used in radio-relay telephoning and in radar . In radio-relay you can aim the radio beam to hit squarely a small 10-foot receiving antenna 30 miles away on the next mountain . In radar you can sweep the beam around to find hostile planes or ships , or to locate other planes or ships in fog or darkness . But wave guides , radio-relays , and coaxial cables are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry . Those waves , just like the waves that travel on wires , need a good strong boost every so often to help them on their way . Bell scientists are experimenting with a new way to do this by using a sort of " electron wind . " This " wind " does its work in a new kind of vacuum tube , the " traveling wave tube . " Short waves carrying your voice or television signals are fed in at one end of the tube and travel inside it through a coil of wire . An electron gun at one end of the tube shoots a stream of powerful electrons down through the inside of the coil . Just as a wind blowing past ripples in a pond makes them into bigger waves , the electron " wind " gives a boost of energy to the electrical waves traveling through the coil , sending them on with new power . Other Bell Laboratories men , meanwhile , are doing things perhaps easier to understand , such as finding how tree branches rub insulation off wires and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when small boys throw rocks at them . Such things may happen right in your own yard , a little closer to home than the mysteries of the electron . On a 100-acre " test farm " near Chester , 304 The National Gec  | New Jersey , is a dense grove of young birch trees among which are strung strands of " drop wire , " the kind of wire that connects your telephone to the main line along the street . These little birches quiver and sway in the slightest breeze and their branches rub on the wire , to show whether they will rub through new , tough kinds of insulation . Even out in the open where no branches rub on it , insulation on a drop wire sometimes breaks down . Bell scientists found it was caused by ultraviolet light from the sun and ozone in the air causing a chemical reaction in the insulation . In the laboratory they made new kinds of insulation , bathed them in artificial ultraviolet light and man-made ozone until they had something that would stand up . Only " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed where various kinds of fungi grow in a low , moist , shady place . Driven into the ground in the bed are stakes made of samples of all kinds of wood , to test how fungi in the soil may cause the wood in telephone poles to rot and how various kinds of chemicals protect the wood from this attack . On a near-by hill are set up rows of fullsized poles , some treated and some not , to see how they resist moisture and rot ( Plate IV ) . Poles are impregnated with creosote under pressure to prevent rot , but Bell men found that fir poles are best treated when green , while poles of southern pine need to be seasoned first . Dancing Wires Make Trouble Out in the West 's " great open spaces , " and in other exposed places , strong winds often set wires and overhead cables to swinging . As wires swing , they may make contact with one another , spoiling the transmission of telephone talk . Swinging cables may crack the protecting lead sheath . This Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as the wind does it , over and over , millions of times , at the same time checking the number of hits when the " wind " blows at various speeds . From this Bell scientists figure how far apart to string wires so that they wo n't hit each other . They 've even taken movies of wires dancing in a high wind and then run them in slow motion . They slip sections of rubber hose over wires , too , to imitate the effect of icing , to see how much more leverage this gives the wind in swinging the wires and how much strain built up in this way is needed to break a wire . Here , too , they bury samples of cable , conduit , and other things used under ground in the telephone system , to learn how they stand up and whether water will seep in . Once a neighboring farmer , seeing two scientists digging up a piece of cable about dark one evening , thought they were gangsters hiding a victim 's body and called the State police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new and better telephone link between America and Europe , a telephone cable under the Atlantic , first transoceanic telephone cable ever laid . You can telephone across the Atlantic now . of course , by radio . Most of the time it works well enough . Radio waves that carry your voice travel in a series of bounces between the earth and the ionosphere , an electrified region of the upper air between 50 and 250 miles aloft . But when sunspots are numerous , showers of electrified particles shoot off from the sun and disrupt the ionosphere . Instead of bouncing back down from it , the radiotelephone waves are absorbed in it or go on through and are lost in space . Sometimes , too , different components of the radio waves arrive at slightly different times , causing fading and distortion . In a cable this would n't happen . You may ask , then , why a telephone cable was n't laid long ago , since transatlantic telegraph cables have been in use since 1866 . A telephone cable was designed , about 1930 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So radiotelephone circuits now are handling thr at once to Europe . To make an ocean telephone cable that c carry that many or more conversations at one you need to put repeaters along it , the same on long-distance cables on land , to pick up t dying power every so often and give it a n boost onward . On land the repeaters above ground where you can get at them make repairs and replace the tubes and bat teries . You ca n't do that on the ocean botto But now Bell men are working on a to phone repeater that fits inside a cable can be wound on a cable drum without b &; damaged . They 've designed a new , tiny . long-lived vacuum tube for these repeat which has every prospect of lasting m years inside the cable on the ocean bott They plan to send power out to the tubes fr land along the cable itself and hope the ca will carry up to 20 conversations at once . Radar , Child of the Telephone When the Nazi menace began to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparedness , scientists of the Bell Laboratories cooperating with the Army  | and Navy quietly began to get ready for war . Since 1937 they had been experimenting with radar , but no one had found a way to generate short waves for the radar beam that ould reflect back an accurate image of what found , so that you could tell whether your dar had picked up a battleship or merchantman , a bomber or a fighter plane . One day in 1940 , long before Pearl Harbor , when England stood alone against the Germans , some English scientists brought to America a new kind of vacuum tube , the magnetron , which they had developed . It was a new , powerful generator to produce short waves that would bring back a more accurate image of what the searching radar beam found . Bell men , cooperating with the British , developed and improved the magnetron even further . Radar was " right down Bell men 's alley . " Working in peacetime to improve the telephone , they had developed new gadgets and ' know-how " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets used many of the same things that Bell men had developed for the telephone system . Vacuum tubes , used in radar to amplify the faint returning echo , were developed from similar tubes that amplify telephone signals . Saucer-shaped antennas , used to direct radar waves outward and catch them when they echoed back , are near kin to antennas used in telephoning by radio-relay ( Plate XVI ) . And the wave guide , already mentioned ' page 301 ) , which was used to carry the more sensitive types of radar waves from generat'ug tube to antenna , grew out of Bell Labo ? atories ' search for ways to transmit electric waves of very high frequency . What radar did is well known . One U. S. warship , with radar-aimed guns , sank an enemy vessel eight miles away at night with only two salvos . At Anzio beachhead radarequipped guns and planes broke up German pattern bombing . Radar-directed guns shot down all but three of 105 buzz bombs launched one day against London . Radar in America was jointly developed by Bell Laboratories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Technology , the Naval Research Laboratory , the Army Signal Corps Laboratory , and other Government , industrial , and university laboratories . All cooperated fully , and , together with British scientists , they gave America and her fillies radar sets better than the enemy ever had . Undoubtedly radar greatly shortened the war and saved countless lives . When the Germans invaded France and the Low Countries , nothing seemed to be able to stop their air force . Antiaircraft fire was not much more accurate than it had been in World War I , when it took an average of 17,000 shots even to hit a hostile aircraft . One Bell scientist , who like many others had been worrying about the Germans ' successes , happened to be working on a potentiometer , or voltage-measuring device , used in connection with sending currents through long-distance telephone cables . Scientist 's Dream Helps Win the War One night this scientist had a dream . In the dream he saw a potentiometer mounted on the trunnion of an antiaircraft gun , and the gun was automatically " tracking " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreams , this one stayed with him . When he woke up he jotted it down , and in this way was born the idea of the amazing electrical gun director , which gave American and British antiaircraft guns almost unbelievable accuracy . It was developed entirely by Bell Laboratories men , based directly on work they did to improve the telephone . You can appreciate what the gun director had to do if you 've ever shot ducks on the wing or tried to swat an elusive fly . You know how hard it is to figure in advance where the ducks or the fly are going to be the next second so that you can put your bird shot or your fly swatter in the right place at the right time . Think how much bigger a job it is to fire an antiaircraft shell so that it comes near a plane flying 300 miles an hour , and with the fuse set to explode when it is near enough the plane to do some damage . To score a hit you have to know the height of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance from the gun to the plane , which is constantly changing . You must know also the velocity of the shell leaving the gun , the speed and direction of the wind blowing against the shell , the temperature of the air , the pull of gravity on the shell , and the effect of air friction . All this helps determine how far ahead of the plane to aim , so that shell and plane will meet . When you 're shooting at a flock of ducks flying past , you may " lead " them with your gun by three or four yards ; but you often " lead " a bomber formation with your antiaircraft guns by three or four miles ! When you have all the data , you have to perform an intricate mathematical calculation , and from the result you aim your gun . If you did this by ordinary methods , the planes would be long out of sight by the time you finished .  | torie set ci ture tions speec longlines . Th of p that well poor the t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i telei T to 1 dete tern as 1 cen cabl c , , Ic n Wa I'he kite pht the and pas in ; But the Bell Laboratories men developed an electrical brain that does all the calculating in a fraction of a second . Its working is not really hard to understand . Into the calculator is fed so much voltage for the plane 's speed , so much for its height , so much for the shell 's velocity , pull of gravity , force of the wind , etc . You might say that each intake of voltage in effect turns the gun a little to the right or left , or pulls its muzzle a little up or down . When all the voltages have finished pushing and pulling on it , the gun is pointing so that the shell it fires will hit the target . The electrical brain does all this pushing and pulling in a fraction of a second . It also operates the fuse setter , which adjusts the fuse on each shell to make it explode at just the right time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director went into action . American and British gunners shot down enemy planes with an average of only 90 shl its instead of thousands . When the Germans started shooting buzz bombs at the great Allied base at Antwerp after the Normandy invasion , the gun director enabled our guns to shoot down all but a few of the 4,856 knows to have been launched .. Best of all , the idea behind the gun direct . r has great potential uses in peace as well as war Out of it has come new knowledge of how to build new high-s calculators to solve a few minutes mat matical problems would take weeks for man with paper a pencil . The principle the gun director 's e trical brain also find new uses in b1 landing systems for planes and in control the heavy airplane t fic around airports . Another " secret weapon , " ready for act when the war ended but never used , is a vice that can detect a man just by the of his body a quarter of a mile away , and cate ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiate . You can sweep this device around a d ened landscape and it will pick up the heat anything , such as a man hidden in the bu that is only slightly warmer than its roundings . From a high-flying plane it indicate the pattern of a river by the d ' ence in the heat radiated from land and ter .

Cull rr " Drop Test " Helps Make Handsets Hard to Break Dropping nearly six feet down a slide , this one bounces unharmed off an iron anvil . Others , on the floor , illustrate how some samples fail when carried to destruction in this type of test . Modern handsets are molded from plastic powder electronically preheated to increase strength ( page 297 ) . ma net me pe an for Pal me of c h. t hi C1 sir th  | tories engineers to offset changes in temperature that cause variations in the loudness of speech traveling over long-distance telephone lines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when warm and poorly when cold ? just the opposite of most good conductors , such as copper . Tiny specks of thermistor material are imbedded in a glass bead the size of a pinhead and connected to the amplifiers along the telephone line . They are so sensitive to heat that they can detect variations in temperature as small as 1/1000 of a degree centigrade . As the cable grows warmer or colder , the loss of power in the transmitted waves goes up or down . The thermistor regulates the amplifiers so that they keep the telephone signal always at the proper loudness and conversations a r e passed on with unvarying clarity . Mine that " Remembers " Still another almostmagic weapon , the magnetic mine that " remembers , " was made possible by permalloy , an easily magnetized alloy developed originally for telephone use . This mine played a large part in helping defeat Japan by sinking her merchant ships . Since it rested on the bottom of ship channels , it could not be swept up . When a steel ship passed near , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the mine . But its best feature was that it could be set to let one , two , three , or any desired number of ships go by unharmed and then explode under the next one . Thus the Japanese never knew when a waterway was clear of mines . One of Bell Laboratories ' biggest contributions to winning the war was the development of special telephones for tanks and giant planes . The frightful noise that accompanies modern war presented a whole new problem to engineers , unlike anything they had to deal with in designing telephones for use in civilian life . An ordinary telephone that worked well in a quiet home or office was useless against the tremendous roar of hundreds of airplane motors on a great bombing raid or the deafening din of a 400-horsepower engine inside the Gilben Dr. Bell with One of His Water-distilling Devices He was interested in finding a way to provide fresh water for fishermen lost at sea in small boats , long before the problem became urgent in World War I. In this apparatus moisture evaporated from salt water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of glass . Pure distilled water trickled down the small tube and into the bottle . Six of these stills supplied his house with drinking water when tap water became contaminated . Dr. Bell also condensed fog with a bellows actuated by the rise and fall of the waves .  | steel walls of a tank . It was often a matter of life and death for a pilot or tank driver to hear correctly a radiotelephone message above the roar of the motors in his ears , and equally vital that his own words spoken into the telephone transmitter should not be drowned out by the noise around him . Shutting out surrounding noise in order to hear clearly was not so difficult . Bell scientists developed a soft rubber pad for the earpieces of telephone headsets which fitted tightly against the ears and cut down outside noise well enough to permit satisfactory hearing when there was no static on the radio . Such earpieces were used in aviators ' helmets and in tank crews ' headgear . But keeping unwanted noise out of the telephone transmitter or microphone was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unlike ordinary telephones , in which a diaphragm picks up vibrations of the air set up by the voice , the throat " mike " had the diaphragm strapped tightly against the user 's neck . When he spoke , the diaphragm picked up the vibrations set up by his voice in his throat walls , and other noise was largely shut out . But the throat microphone was not entirely satisfactory , because it did not transmit the speech sounds formed in the nose and mouth which are important for complete clarity ( page 297 ) . To overcome this difficulty the Bell engineers built a microphone with a shield which covered the nose and mouth . This excluded outside noise and permitted the user to speak in the normal way with all the speech sounds transmitted . This type of microphone was built right into aviators ' oxygen masks , which formed a noise shield in themselves . Still another antinoise device was the lip microphone . It operated on the principle that if sounds strike both sides of a telephone diaphragm they will cancel out its vibrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one side they will be . The diaphragm of the lip microphone is placed very close to the mouth . Surrounding noise still strikes both sides of it and cancels out , but the voice strikes only one side , and so the diaphragm vibrates and transmits the voice sounds . The lip mike was used in directing landing operations above the noise of battle and in persuading enemy troops to surrender . Altogether , the Bell Laboratories worked on 1,200 military projects during the war , some of which are still so secret that Bell men do n't even mention them to each other . Its staff was expanded from 5,000 to 8,000 men and women during wartime , and $150,000,000 was spent on war developments . To train Army and Navy officers and men in the operation and maintenance of the new weapons developed there , the Laboratories operated a school in which more than 4,000 students received instruction . So numerous were the instruction books for these scientific weapons that during the war the Laboratories became , next to Uncle Sam , the Nation 's largest book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the days when all a soldier needed to know was how to load and fire a squirrel rifle ! Telephone By-products From telephone research have come not only these many scientific weapons but also many other by-products for peacetime use which have helped make Bell Laboratories famous . Bell men developed the orthophonic process of recording sound electrically , and " auditory perspective , " a method of picking up the music of a symphony orchestra from several different points , to make it sound more natural when reproduced over loud-speakers . They made the first radiotelephones used on commercial air lines . Bell men 's research made possible new vrays to measure accurately the noise in subways , traffic tunnels , airplanes , and factories , and c it down ; and improvements in acoustics auditoriums ( Plate XIV ) . Vitamin B , , or thiamin , so essential health and now put into many " vitamin riched " foods , was first produced in pure fo by a Bell chemist in his spare time .
