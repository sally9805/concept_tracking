When the first raw conscript soldiers drifted in last fall at Fort Jackson , S.C. , Major General Henry D. Russell , in command of the post , was appalled at the number of them who could neither read nor write . Before long he had on his hands some 600 total illiterates . General Russell got in touch with WPA . Result : at Fort Jackson last week elementary classes , taught by WPA teachers , were going full blast , and an Army education program had spread from coast to coast . <P> In World War I , 25.3% of the first 1,500,000 U.S. citizens examined for the Army were illiterate . The average soldier had only half completed the seventh grade of grammar school . No figures were available last week on the number of illiterates in the draft , but the average soldier has finished his third year of high school . <P> But modern armies require a much better-educated personnel than was needed in 1917 , and there are still too many ignoramuses in uniform to suit Army leaders . So WPA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write in the past six years , last week had 82 teachers on the rolls in 16 Army camps . <P> Some of their activities : <P> &gt; WPA has published an elementary textbook , First Days in the Army , for soldiers learning their ABCs . First lesson : " I ate in the mess hall . I ate and ate . I ate with the company . The company ate in the mess hall . We ate in the mess hall . ... " Other lessons stress the benefits of Army life-good food , clean barracks , etc . <P> &gt; Candidates for appointment as flying cadets ( who must have the equivalent of two years of college credits ) learn algebra , trigonometry , history and other academic subjects at a number of Air Corps bases . <P> &gt; At Fort Des Moines , Iowa , noncommissioned officers study shorthand . <P> &gt; Ohio 's National Guardsmen are taught to read maps . <P> &gt; All commissioned officers in the Air Corps ( about 10,000 men ) have signed up to learn Spanish . This will put some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four defense bases in Puerto Rico classes in English have been started for island recruits . <P> Classes are usually held in mess halls or recreation buildings . But at several Southern posts , including the Savannah , Ga . air base , soldiers assemble at night for instruction at local high schools which by day are filled with giggling girls in socks and sweaters .
