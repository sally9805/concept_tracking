The President of the U.S. can now requisition private property needed for defense . Until he signed the bitterly fought property requisition bill last week , his power to do this was vague and general . Now it is definite and specific . <P> He got the power just in time to use it . Priorities Chief Donald Nelson last week told a Congressional committee that 1,378,000 Ib. of copper , some of it " undoubtedly Axis-owned , " lay in U.S. warehouses , untouchable despite the acute copper shortage . Not only will that copper now be requisitioned , but also carloads of machinery , steel , silk , rubber , tin plate , manganese and other hoarded , hidden and frozen inventories . Economic Defense Board and OPM agents combed New York City , Philadelphia , Boston and San Francisco freight yards for them last week ( TIME , Oct. 20 ) . <P> The new Presidential power over private property is not as complete as he has asked for . Dictator-fearing Congressmen limited it so that : <P> &gt; The act automatically expires June 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes first . <P> &gt; The President , before seizure , must determine an immediate need which will " not admit of delay or resort to any other source of supply " after " all other means . . . have been exhausted . " <P> &gt; The Government must pay " fair market value " of the property . <P> &gt; Seized property no longer needed must be returned by Dec. 31 , 1943 , if the original owner wants to buy it back for " a fair price . " <P> &gt; Authority to requisition or require registration of firearms used for sport or individual self-protection is specifically excluded . <P> &gt; Requisitioning of equipment in actual use in any operating business is barred . <P> This week an executive order is expected to put the law into actual operation . It will also name a requisitioning tsar , probably tough-minded Brigadier General Philip B. Fleming , hitherto Wages &; Hours administrator . OPMites eagerly awaited the order to see whether Administrator Fleming would be given real power to deal with non-cooperators.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
