Last week the U. S. Navy shook itself violently , prepared to settle down Feb. 1 under a new seagoing command , a new organization . The shakeup , announced by Secretary Frank Knox , was not particularly notable in its dimensions . But to most naval officers it was of extreme interest , for if war comes , this is likely to be the new command and this the new organization under which the Navy will fight . <P> To many a landlubber it has long seemed odd that , with a war going on in Europe , the Atlantic is policed only by a U. S. Naval Squadron , incongruously called the Atlantic Patrol Force . After Feb. 1 that Patrol Force will be the Atlantic Fleet . Its present commander , frosty-eyed Rear Admiral Ernest Joseph King ( who is also a naval aviator ) will take his orders direct from Chief of Naval Operations Harold Raynsford Stark in Washington . King can logically expect soon to get four-star rank . <P> The Atlantic Fleet will have 125 vessels , led by three old battleships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get more strength , Frank Knox said , as new warships are put into commission . How many or what types , he would not say . The Navy has decided that the less said about movement and assignment of men-of-war the better . <P> For the Pacific Fleet , Secretary Knox had a new Commander in Chief U. S. Fleet , No. 1 seagoing job of the U. S. Navy , to announce . Upped from command of cruisers of the Battle Force to the highest seagoing job in the Navy was Rear Admiral Husband Edward Kimmel , jumped over 46 admirals to fly the four-star flag of CINCUS at the main of the flagship Pennsylvania . As CINCUS , 58-year-old " Hubby " Kimmel will be in charge of operations of his own fleet , of training in all three , will command two or more of the fleets if they are concentrated in one operation . Relieved from command will be the present CINCUS , tall , square-chinned James Otto Richardson . When new CINCUS Kimmel takes over , 62-year-old Jo Richardson will head for Washington for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the Pacific Fleet is based , the U. S. 's third fleet , the Asiatic , last week kept a wary eye cocked on Japan and the combustible China coast . But the shake-up did not shake it much . Still flying his flag on the flagship Augusta was 63-year-old Admiral Thomas Charles Hart , whom fellow Annapolis cadets called " Dad " ( because he had a baby face ) . Wise in the ways of the Orient , Tommy Hart has only five months to go to retirement , has done too good a job to be pulled out before his time is up .
