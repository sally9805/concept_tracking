There was a hand-scrawled sign on the fence post of a cross-roads farm : come in for coffee and cake . <P> There were any number of signs like it in the Far West . Soldiers stationed near by , passing along the gravel roads , miles from nowhere in the middle of winter , saw them even when they could not stop . Over the U.S. last week people saw their soldiers in a new light . But the change was greatest in the West , where the war seemed nearer , where the whole region was a military area and where , outside the cities , the line between the soldiers and the people dissolved and all but disappeared in the countryside of scattered farms , small towns , big trees and rain . <P> War made the Pacific Coast conscious of its own immensity . Nearly ten million people live on the 318,000 square miles between Bellingham and San Diego . But four million of them are concentrated in the ten big cities ( Los Angeles , San Francisco , Seattle , Portland , Oakland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sacramento ) ; the others are spread out over a territory as big as France and the United Kingdom combined . <P> At forest-fire lookout towers , in little tarpaper-covered shacks scattered on the hills along the coast , spotters watched the grey skies , 24 hours a day , in three-hour shifts . In the forests , the biggest remaining forests in the U.S. , trees crashed as trails were cut up the slopes of commanding peaks . In the dripping , head-high underbrush of Oregon grape , salal , devil 's club , under the giant trees that reach as high as 20-story buildings , in the jungle thickets where only the Indians feel at home , the Northwestern countryside reached a sense of war . <P> On Whidbey Island in Puget Sound , on the channel to Bremerton , farmers kept watch all night on volunteer beach patrols , moved into shacks when the wind blew down their tents , tending cows when not on patrol . <P> At every lumber mill the tower of the refuse burner glows day &; night . In a big lumber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 18 ) , the dull red domes of these burners stand out on a rainy evening as bright spots in the gloom , looking like a dozen autumn moons simultaneously rising . During the blackouts men with fire hoses rushed in , doused the fires . It took 25 barrels of crude oil to get each fire burning again , and there are more than 500 burners in the lumber country . <P> No one could say where , in the continental vastness , the West Coast 's sense of the closeness of war dissolved . It was still present in Arizona . Towns along the Colorado blacked out with the Coast cities . The cowboys herding Arizona 's 147,000 beef cattle became airplane spotters . Texas ranchers felt their isolation and formed bands called the Guerrillas , each member being required to have a high-powered rifle , 500 rounds of ammunition , and a tankful of gasoline for his car .
