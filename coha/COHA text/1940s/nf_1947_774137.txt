txt  | to editorialize in direct violation of the Constitution and Section 326 of the Communications Act . This brings us to a series of very practical points affecting a broadcaster 's day-to-day operation . When the Commission , in violation of the First Amendment and in violation of Section 326 of the Act , specifically requires a station to cease editorializing in order to retain its license ? and then applies the rule to more than a thousand broadcasting stations ? is that considering " over-all " program policy ? or is that censorship ? When an FCC opinion warns radio stations carrying religious programs that they had best provide facilities for atheists to deny the existence of God ? is that a consideration of " over-all " programming ? For 25 years it has been the voluntary practice of the vast majority of U.S. radio stations to give equal time to opposing points of view on controversial issues . Indeed , this practice was a cardinal point in the NAB Code . So effective and so widely observed was this policy that in public opinion polls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? have voted radio the fairest of all the media of mass communication in giving both sides of arguments . Yet the FCC , again , based on its policy of making decisions in the crucible of individual cases , has assumed this function as one of government and has required , as a prerequisite of maintaining a station license , that a broadcaster must " provide full and equal opportunity for the presentation to the public of all sides of public issues . " Is this a consideration of " over-all " policy ? Incidentally , in the bill now before you , this provision becomes law ? and with a new twist ? for in Section 17 of this bill , radio stations giving time to one side of a controversial question will , in effect , have to give twice as much time to the opposing side . In his testimony before a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee recently , Chairman Denny , of the FCC , was asked about the Commission requirement that broadcasters report percentage of commercial programs and the number of commercial announcements carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in effect , if the amount of commercial content reported is large , that 's like running up a red flag and then we will examine further to see whether the station should be set for hearing on its application for renewal of license . Is that not the same kind of indirect censorship by economic control which the Supreme Court has steadfastly prohibited in its decisions against efforts to tax or withdraw the second-class mailing privilege from newspapers and publications ? The bill cures none of these existing evils and , indeed , amends Section  | 326 of the present Act in such a way as to confirm them as the will of Congress . If this he the intent ? and I can hardly believe it ? allow me , as a longtime radio station operator , to make a few observations on the future implications of such intent . The same electronic miracles that have brought you radio have a great many more wonders in store . Some weeks ago , in Philadelphia , two newspapers and their affiliated radio stations successfully demonstrated a sustained and near perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the journalistic and radio field believe , as I do , that tomorrow 's newspaper may be printed daily on a facsimile receiver in your home . When that day comes , the newspapers of America will be subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission . Where will be the freedom of the press which successive Congresses and Courts have protected for 156 years when the regulation prohibiting editorializing applies to the facsimile newspaper , and when the rule requiring equal opportunity for all sides of public questions becomes law for the American press ? Incidentally , by the standard applied to radio broadcasting stations , a good many American newspapers would be virtually 100% commercial . Certainly they would not be denied facsimile licenses on this basis ? I have been urging U.S. editors and publishers to examine carefully the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission in the light of the miracle of facsimile broadcasting . This is a pursuit worthy of every free American 's attention . Even closer to realization than facsimile is television ? an art of great import to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For much of television will be broadcast from film ? whether it is received directly into the home or by groups in tele-theaters which are already being equipped for the purpose . Television , of course , like broadcasting and facsimile , is subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission . Would the opinion requiring broadcasters to devote time to atheists to answer religious programs apply ? If the " King of Kings " were shown in tele-theaters , would the producers have to provide a spectacle on atheism to counteract it ? I note with interest Eric Johnston 's recent announcement that the film industry will undertake editorial shorts as a public service . If these are televised , will the movie industry be hauled into hearing as were broadcasters ? I 've urged moving picture executives also to examine the rules and regulations of the FCC in light of television .  | I earnestly believe that we are face to face here with a grave decision , of incalculable importance to our national well being and the future of our democratic institutions . I sincerely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as free as the press " ? or ? stand by and watch the press and motion picture subjected to the same government controls ? the same methods of intimidation , the same " censorship " ? as radio suffers today . Section 9 of the White bill amends subsection ( b ) of Section 307 of the Communications Act and is found on page 11 of the bill . It provides that in considering applications for licenses . . . the Commission shall make such distribution of licenses , frequencies , hours of operation and power . . . as to provide a fair , efficient and equitable distribution of radio service .. . giving effect in each instance to the needs and requirements thereof . In this section of the White bill , the authors probably refer , in the words " needs and requirements thereof , " to the economic needs and requirements as well as others . Radio broadcasting in the United States is a free competitive enterprise and is not , in any sense , a public utility . This concept is clearly spelled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow of a doubt by the Supreme Court in the decision in the Sanders Bros. case in which the Court prohibited the Commission from taking into account , in its licensing process , the economic aspects of a grant . This Section 9 could , in effect , nullify this decision of the Supreme Court and would give the Commission discretion to take into consideration , in the granting of licenses in a community , the economic consequences of the addition of stations in that community . The National Association of Broadcasters takes strong issue with this section . Since the very beginning of broadcasting , our people have devoutly hoped that the day would come when there would he frequencies available for any person , firm or corporation desiring a radio station and when an absolutely free competitive situation would exist . Slowly but surely , with the coming of FM , with scientific advancements in the art of electronics , we have been approaching a condition in which there might he available frequencies for anybody who had the qualifications and the money to enter the business . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of program regulation , which we feel are an infringement upon freedom of speech , would vanish . Now comes this Section 9 of the White bill , which would extend the powers of the Commission in their licensing function and would give them the right to determine , though certainly not to capacity , the number of broadcasting stations which a community could support . It seems obvious to us that if a government agency has the right and power to protect existing broadcasting facilities in a community against  | competition and to create artificial quasi-utilities , that it must , in turn , have the power to regulate rates , sales prices and so on . I hardly need call to your attention the fact that such power over the economics of a medium of mass communication is a serious threat to its freedom and to freedom of expression . I feel sure that the authors of this bill had no intention of overriding the Supreme Court decision and , indeed , in Section 16 , amending Section 326 of the Act , they evidence an opposite view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects of broadcasting . We strongly urge that the words " giving effect in each instance to the needs and requirements thereof " be deleted and , in their place , the words " with due consideration to proper engineering standards " be substituted . With respect to Section 8 of this bill , amending subsection ( j ) of Section 303 of the Act , I have a very brief observation . I am at a loss to understand why it is necessary to place upon the radio stations of America the onerous burden of providing voluminous records of programs , and to prescribe burdensome uniform systems of financial reports , if the language in Section 16 of the Act is interpreted literally . I can not understand the necessity for detailed financial reports if the Commission is prohibited from regulating the business aspects of radio , and I can not understand the need for voluminous program reports if the Commission is prohibited from controlling the substance of any material to be broadcast by any radio broadcasting station . It seems to me that the two sections are inconsistent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program reports can serve would be to provide the licensing authority with specific information upon which to regulate programs and business practices in some form .  | Director of Public Relations , National Association of Broadcasters WISH to offer a statement highlighting the corollary development of publishing and broadcasting in the United States . This is presented in an effort to reinforce the thesis that radio broadcasting is governed by the First Amendment to the Constitution and subject , therefore , to the same guaranties of freedom that apply to the press , the pulpit and public assemblies . This statement is intended as supplemental testimony to that heretofore offered in support of the contention that Section 326 of the Communications Act of 1934 ( Section 16 or S. 1333 ) should be strengthened to provide such guaranties . The intention here is to establish that radio in the United States can be as free as the press ; that such latitude in broadcasting is desirable , consonant as it is with the requirements of democratic government ; that broadcasting will not have attained its full development as an instrument of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest is determined by the people ( as is the case in the press ) rather than by the licensing authority . That there is danger of censorship where there is power to license is implicit in S. 1333 , wherein it is provided that Section 16 shall amend Section 326 to change the titular heading to " Censorship . " Appearing in the new language ( S. 1333 ) is the statement ( b ) " The Commission shall have no power to censor , alter , or in any manner affect or control the substance of any material to be broadcast . . . etc. "  | If it is the intent of the language to deny all mechanics of censorship to the licensing authority , then Section 3 of S. 1333 should contain specific definitions of the words " censor " and " substance . " I subscribe to the belief that the Federal Communications Commission 's Blue Book ( Public Service Responsibility of Broadcast Licensees , March 7 , 1946 ) and the Mayflower Decision ( which holds that licensees have no privilege of advocacy ) are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thought processes of man : the eye and the ear . If we are to undertake a philosophy of Government which anticipates free access to those avenues , as I understand the Bill of Rights to assert , we can not differentiate between them . Whether a man reads something or hears something does not fundamentally alter the proposition that he thereby acquires knowledge . The same knowledge transmitted over a broadcasting station to listening ears or transmitted through new columns to reading eyes is , in the final analysis , directed to the mind of man . Consequently one instrument of transmission should be subject to no more control of its product than the other , if the avowed purpose of free media in a free nation is to enlighten the people . If such premise is acceptable , then new legislation governing broadcast licensees should endeavor to clarify beyond any reasonable doubt the limitations placed upon the licensing authority . I do not believe the present Act does so , for despite its language the Commission has adopted such a decision as that encountered in the Mayflower Case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? as defined by Chairman Charles R. Denny , Jr . before the Appropriations Committee of the House of Representatives ( 1947 ) ? establishes " standards " that " comprise the gloss which the Commission 's decisions have written around the words public interest , convenience and necessity ' . " Nor do I believe that S. 1333 , as written , does so , for it incorporates in its language the undefined term , " substance , " and adds the proviso : " Provided , that nothing herein contained shall be construed to limit the*/ authority of the Commission in its considerations of applications for renewal of licenses to determine whether or not the licensee has operated iii the public interest . " The Commission 's Chairman has testified that this phrase " public interest " permits the establishment of standards which represent " gloss . " I understand that " gloss " has a special meaning to a lawyer , i.e. , functions and powers not conferred by law . Five of the seven members of the Commission are attorneys and would be conversant with this definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most part of attorneys acknowledges that legislative language gives it the power to " legislate beyond the statute , " we encounter here two specific dangers : ( 1 ) The surrender of legislative power by the duly constituted lawmaking body , the Congress of the United States . ( 2 ) Negation of our historic governmental concept that the law should comprehend , and make provision against " the insolence of office . " A brief examination of the development of a free press in this nation illustrates the emergence from " licensed authority " of one of our great media . Movable type was discovered by Gutenberg in 1443 . ( One might consider this in context with the discovery of the audion tube by Dr. Lee DeForest in 1906 . ) The first press established in the Colonies was installed at Harvard College in 1638 . ( Exactly 280 years later , in 1918 , the vacuum tube began to replace the old spark and arc transmitters . ) The first newspaper published in America issued in 1690 from the press of Richard Pierce in Boston , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly operated standard broadcasting stations in the United States ? KDKA Pittsburgh and WWJ Detroit ? went on the air in 1920 . ) The early newspapers , such as Publick Occurrences , were licensed by the Crown . And the first radio stations were licensed by the radio division of the Department of Commerce . Radio stations , in the early days ( circa 1920 ) were licensed primarily because of the confusion which resulted from the limitation on the number of available frequencies . The first newspapers were licensed arbitrarily , for purposes of Governmental censorship . According to Robert W. Jones in his Journalism in the United States ( E. P. Dutton &; Co. , Inc . ) , " The first American editors were confronted by coldly hostile officials inclined to discipline any critical comment . " This policy is best evidenced by one instruction from the Crown , which stated " and for as much as great inconvenience may arise by liberty of printing within our said territory under your Government you are to provide by all necessary orders that no person keeping any printing press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other matter whatsoever printed without your especial leave and license first obtained . " It is interesting to observe , inasmuch as in the current broadcasting legislation we are dealing with the phrase " public interest , convenience and  | necessity , " that even in this early 17th century regulation by the Crown , the word " inconvenience " was introduced . The term , in this instance , anticipated that the inconvenience was one which the Crown felt would cause most distress to the king 's ministers , with little concern given to the " convenience " of the public . During these early days of colonial printing , the hand press in use ? similar to the screw-type wine press ? was so small that a four-page paper usually required four impressions . The paper was moistened before the impression was taken and between runs the paper was suspended from strings to dry . Printing ink was of poor quality , for the most part homemade . It was smeared on the form by hand with a piece of buckskin . ( One finds analogy here in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listeners who could hear stations listened on headphones , and found the static as disturbing to their ears as the smeared newspapers were to colonial eyes . ) Newspaper printing as a mechanical art really made little progress until the 19th century . Had Gutenberg walked into an American print shop in 1800 , most authorities agree , he would have found little to surprise him . In 1822 , Daniel Treadwell of Boston built a press with a wooden frame designed to be driven by steam . Isaac Adams , of the same city , improved the Treadwell press in 1830 . ( In 1923 , the principle of negative feed-back to stabilize and reduce distortion in transmission circuits , modulators , amplifiers , and detectors , also describing automatic volume control , was developed by Stuart Ballantine . ) The newspaper then , about one century before broadcasting did so , was emerging from the experimental " baling wire " era as a result of laboratory research . Most of us consider the emergence of broadcasting from a distorted signal reaching a mere handful of people to its position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet the newspaper proceeded from small weekly operation with limited circulation to metropolitan daily operation with large circulation in a span of 30 years ? between 1830 and 1860 . In 1775 there were 37 newspapers in the Colonies . In 1840 , there were 1631 in the United States ; and by 1850 , the figure was 2302 . ( On Jan. 12 , 1922 there were 30 broadcasting stations in the United States ; by 1940 , there were 814 ; by Jan. 1 , 1947 there were 1523 . ) Mechanical development accounted for the increase in both media ? mechanical development which made it possible to establish more units and to extend the coverage of the individual units .  | Impetus was given to newspaper development by the first cylinder press , developed in 1846 . It was installed by the Philadelphia Ledger . A ten cylinder rotary press was capable of 20,000 impressions hourly ? heralding the day of big newspaper circulation . ( In 1925 , KDKA Pittsburgh and WGY Schenectady tested 50,000 watt transmitters which were to multiply manifold the audience available to radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the newspaper field . ) In 1848 newspapers discovered a system for employing telegraphic and Iandwire communications to form a network news-gathering agency , the Associated Press . ( The first network broadcast was between WEAF New York and WNAC Boston in 1923 ? five years before the National Broadcasting Company was to establish the first coast-to-coast network . There are now four coast-to-coast networks , and four nationwide newsgathering services . ) In 1861 , the curved stereotyped plate was developed ? and cylinder presses thereafter imprinted by this plate process , rather than by cylinderset type . ( And in 1932 , the velocity microphone was perfected by RCA ? making possible more faithful reproduction of sound , as the stereotype made possible more faithful reproduction of typeface . ) The analogy between the development of the press and the development of broadcasting can be carried forward in greater detail . But this should serve sufficiently to indicate that there was sharp correlation between the two in the mechanical phase . The importance of this historic relation is to be found in this remarkable development : as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , the cause of a free press has advanced as well ; BUT as licensed broadcasting stations have advanced in their capacity to serve the people , their freedom has been retarded . We have then a situation which is not consonant with the philosophy of our form of government . The conception that the FCC is trustee for the American people is completely erroneous . Sovereignty in the United States is vested in the American people . The American people delegate it to Congress . That authority ? the people 's authority ? can not be delegated to anyone , except for limited purposes designated by Congress . As a consequence , there exist no trustees for the American people , for the Constitution 's guarantee of rights reserves those rights to individual citizens . This theory finds successful acceptance and is practiced in the area of the press . It is not practiced in broadcasting .  | One of the nation 's first newspapers of pre-Revolutionary days to sue cessfully oppose the oppressive censorship of the Crown was Benjamin Franklin 's Pennsylvania Gazette . In the early 18th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Superfine crown soap ? it cleanses fine linens , muslins , laces , chintzes , cambric , etc. , with ease and expedition , which often suffer more from the long hard rubbing of the washer , through the ill qualities of the soap than the wearing . " That was probably the first " soap commercial " in American history and it was written by Benjamin Franklin himself in 1732 ? just 42 years after the first newspaper was founded in America . ( Radio , considerably maligned these days in certain quarters for its commercials , is 27 years old . ) It is at least diverting to note also that Benjamin Franklin was in other diversified pursuits ; this in view of the fact that some regulatory implications have been attached to the diverse pursuits of a few broadcasting station owners . Mr. Franklin was not only a trader of considerable renown but , additionally , owned a company which produced two popular patent medicines of the day : ( 1 ) True and Genuine Godfrey 's Cordial and ( 2 ) Seneka Rattlesnake Root . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fienklin might consider a philosophy for regulating broadcasting today ? especially in light of the fact that he not only was one of America 's first editors to militantly demand freedom of the press , but also found a place in chronologies of radio 's development through his kite experiments in an electrical storm in 1749 . As the Colonies approached the revolutionary period of our history , several newspapers were established which began to shake off the yoke implied in that masthead dictum " Published by Authority . " Among these was 21-year-old Isaiah Thomas of the Massachusetts Spy ; Sam and John Adams contributed richly to the Boston Gazette ; Benjamin Edes , John Gill and John Hancock were others . Attempts to suppress such papers as the Massachusetts Spy , and indict its publisher as guilty of seditious libel , failed . The public was beginning to awaken to the value of the press as a force for common good . This process was hastened by the famous pamphlets of Tom Paine during the revolutionary period . It was the newspapers ' active part in the Revolution which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict with something of the dignity which identifies editors today . It was a far cry from November 17 , 1734 when Peter Zenger was tried for " publishing several seditious libels having in  | them many things tending to raise factions , tumults and sedition among the people ... " It was the stirring defense of Mr. Zenger by Andrew Hamilton which laid the foundation for free press in the United States , when Mr. Hamilton said : " I hope to be pardoned , sir , for my zeal upon this occasion : It is an old and wise caution that when our neighbors ' house is on fire , we ought to take care of our own . ' Withal , blessed be God , I live in a government where liberty is well understood , and freely enjoyed ; yet experience has shown us all ( I 'm sure it has me ) that a had precedent in one government is soon set up for an authority in another and therefore I can not but think it mine , and every honest man 's duty that ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) we ought at the same time be on our guard against power , wherever we apprehend that it may affect ourselves or our fellow-subjects . " This brief review of the development of the press as it relates to the development of broadcasting is offered to indicate that the difference between the two media is not one that can be defined by the boundaries of public interest . Both exist to serve the public interest . Both have emerged into fuller development after distressing periods of trial . Each survives by revenue collected from advertisers . Each , in its way , strives to inform and to entertain . The difference that originally did exist is one not accentuated by method of operation , historic development , or content , but rather by a physical phenomenon : the limitation on the number of frequencies available for broadcast . But even this phenomenon has grown less important in recent years . Additional frequencies have been found so that the Federal Communications Commission was able to allocate in the year 1946 more broadcasting stations than had been allocated in the U.S. in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June 16 , 1947 that 100 new FM channels would be available in July . ) We shall now see coming into play in the broadcasting business , more directly than ever , the principal factor which has caused a leveling off in the number of newspapers in the country ? the economic factor . Chairman Denny of the Commission himself testified before the Appropriations Committee that he thought many stations would fail because economic survival was impossible in such a competitive market . But even in the presence of this development ( the lessening of the factor of scarcity of frequencies ) there has been an increase in regulatory control . This increase has been evidenced by regulatory actions of the Commission in interpreting the Communications Act of 1934 . It is the opinion of most broadcasters that these regulations have gone far beyond the intent  | of Congress . They have enforced these regulations upon broadcasters " by authority " that has been assumed . They have in many ways ( viz. , Mayflower Decision and Blue Book ) , reintroduced into a free medium in our democracy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be argued logically that one man , a broadcaster , is less capable of serving the public interest than another man , a publisher . Or if this is asserted , then what of the anomalous situation which finds approximately 35% of the broadcasting stations in the country owned by newspapers ? Does it follow that one who can operate a newspaper with the public 's interest at heart ( without " over-all review " ) must be subjected to such " over-all review " in the content of his radio programs ? Between 1830 and 1860 , the newspapers of this nation left the laboratory mind and entered the social conscience ? with the development of new methods of printing . Nothing less than this has happened to broadcasting in the last three decades . Today American newspapers use about 4 million tons of newsprint annually . Last year $200,000,000 in raw materials were converted by the newspapers into a product which sold to the public for $750,000,000 . Radio , which once reached only a handful of our population , today can be heard by over 90% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the historic development of publishing and broadcasting , both as mechanical devices for communications and as instruments for social progress . Let us look at them , side by side , today , considering the nature of their content . About 20% of the average station 's time today is devoted to news . ( This is approximately the percentage allocated to news by representative metropolitan dailies . ) About 5% of a station 's time is programmed for commentaries ( and you will find about that percentage space allocated to columnists who are commentators for the readers ) . The liveliest news on the air is programmed at best listening hours ? 8 a.m. , 12 noon , 11 p.m. ? when a maximum audience is available . The newspaper accomplishes this same purpose by headlining news on page one . The following comparison highlights the similarities in content between the newspaper and broadcasting station :  | figure Radio has pursued not only the tradition , but the pattern of the press ? in all but one vitally important respect . Radio has no editorial page . Radio is denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communications Commission and that existing threat to radio 's freedom is compounded by such made law as the Blue Book . On July 3 , 1945 , President Truman ? who is spokesman for the Democratic Party ? stated , in a letter to Broadcasting Magazine : " In my opinion , the free voice of radio never has faced a more important challenge in its 25-year history than that which lies before it now as Allied weapons are turned upon the last enemy of liberty . Broadcasters must direct their energies in the future , as they have so nobly in the past , toward the liquidation of all resistance to the principles upon which their own free charter is founded . " Our lawmakers demonstrated admirable foresight by decreeing that America , as the birthplace of radio , should have a free , competitive system , unfettered by artificial barriers and regulated only as to the laws of nature and the limitation of facilities . That this system has worked is demonstrated by radio 's remarkable strides as a public service medium . The wisdom of that original policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fullfledged war service ? a task yet unfinished . Since Pearl Harbor , American radio has written its own Magna Charta . But beyond the day of final victory there lie myriad problems . " Radio , with the press , must give inspired leadership and lend its facilities to making more intimate and workable the relationship between the people and the Government . For radio itself there are challenging days ahead . New services are in the offing ? services such as television and FM broadcasting , which will open new vistas of opportunity for public service .  | " American radio is in good hands . With many hundreds of new stations possible by virtue of the opening of these new frontiers by our scientists and engineers , the free competition of the present will become even freer . " The American system has worked and must keep working . Regulation by natural forces of competition , even with obvious concomitant shortcomings , is to be preferred over rigid Governmental regulation of a medium that by its very nature must be maintained as free as the press . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their fashion , warriors for our common purpose and solicit their continued zeal in the cause of freedom and decency .

Federal regulation of radio is necessary in view of the natural limitations of wave lengths , but this gives no excuse for censorship . We oppose the use of licensing to establish arbitrary controls . Licenses should be revocable only when , after public hearing , due cause for cancellation is shown . " The Constitution guarantees against enactment of law which will abridge freedom of speech . The Democratic Party wants radio " as free as the press .

Certainly , Section 16 , S. 1333 , as written , does not do so , for it offers less protection than the existing Act . This is the cornerstone provision of radio legislation . Even now , facsimile is emerging ? as did radio and the press , in their early days of development ? from the laboratory . It is now possible to transmit an 8 ? by 11 inch page via facsimile in less than one minute . The question may not be , in the world of tomorrow : Will radio be as free as the press ? It may be , and in the context of this proposed law lies the answer : Will the press be free ?  | SINCERELY appreciate this opportunity to appear before this Committee and express my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposed legislation now under discussion . I respectfully urge that the language of Section 16 of the bill be revised to make it unmistakably clear and unqualified that the Federal Communications Commission shall have no authority to regulate the business of a broadcast licensee , nor to exercise any control over the economics of this form of free and competitive American enterprise . The present language of Section 16 of the bill , proposing to amend Sec. 326 of the Act is , in my opinion , ambiguous ; on the one hand it states that " Nothing in this Act shall be understood or construed to give the Commission the power to regulate the business of the licensee of any radio broadcast station unless specifically authorized in this Act , " ( Sec. 326 , a ) and later it states : " Provided , that nothing herein contained shall be construed to limit the authority of the Commission in its consideration of applications for renewal of licenses to determine whether or not the licensee has operated in the public interest . " ( Sec. 326 , b ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to regulate much of the business of the licensee , and if the above proviso is enacted into law , it is believed the Commission will engage even more actively in regulating the business of the broadcaster . For example , in filing applications for a broadcast license , the applicant has been required by the Commission to state what percentage of his pro-  | grams will be commercial , and what percentage will be sustaining . This promise has been weighed by the Commission in granting , or refusing , a license . In periodic reports to the Commission and in subsequent applications for renewal of license , the licensee has been required to state what percentage of his time was devoted to sustaining programs and what percentage was commercial . The effect of this regulation over the business of the broadcaster is restrictive , inimical to the best interests of the American system of broadcasting , and therefore is not in the public interest . For instance , an applicant for a license may in all good faith state that he intends to devote 60% of his time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then is committed to this arbitrary division , year after year . But in the meantime , economic conditions are likely to change . Rapidly rising costs of operation may alter his situation sharply . The commercial rate that he was able to charge in order to operate on a sound basis by selling 60Io of his time , may have to be lowered because of one or more variable factors such as the influx of more radio stations into his market and consequent division of audience ; increased competition from other stations or from other advertising media at lower rates ; a loss of network affiliation or a change in network affiliation that might bring about a loss of audience and a resultant necessity for lowering rates ; development of new techniques or of new advertising services , including radio services such as FM , television , facsimile , and so forth . In short , it is impossible for any broadcaster definitely to set up an arbitrary division of his time into sustaining and commercial , and be sure that he can always continue to operate on a sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitrary limits forced upon him by Commission regulation may drive him into bankruptcy , or into a lowered standard of operation in the public interest . The alternative under the present system , of course , is for the Commission to allow a licensee to change from time to time the arbitrary division of his broadcast time into commercial and sustaining , but to allow this , the Commission would thereby be forced to consider the economics of radio broadcasting , and this is believed to be contrary to the intention of the Congress in writing the Act . It should be emphasized that any arbitrary division into " sustaining " and " commercial " time is actually meaningless , insofar as public interest is concerned . Broadcasts of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra were unquestionably in the public interest when they were carried on a sustaining basis by stations of the CBS network ; were they any less in the public interest under sponsorship by the United States Rubber Company , when that company used about 31/2 minutes during the intermission of the hourand-a-half program to deliver a commercial message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in the public interest . Does  | make them any less so , if the Atlantic Refining Co. sponsors the broadcasts and uses approximately five minutes out of every hour of broadcasting to tell about its goods and services ? It can be asserted that , in nearly every instance , a program that is worthy of being broadcast on a sustaining basis is worthy of sponsorship ; that programs thus sponsored nearly always become better programs , by virtue of extra promotion placed behind the program by the sponsor , as well as by the broadcaster who is being remunerated and thus can afford additional promotion ; by the guarantee of the best possible time for broadcasting to reach a maximum audience of those interested in that particular type of program ; by assurance that programs thus sponsored will not be shifted or moved on the station 's schedule ; by increased interest and attention to the program and its innumerable details by all those concerned , including top management which is naturally conscious of the remuneration received ; the announcers and artists who under present labor contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs ; the continuity writers , producers and all other station personnel who are , of course , always aware that it is the commercial sponsorship of programs that makes their jobs secure . As a matter of fact there is no such thing as a " sustaining " program anyway . All programs are " commercial " in the sense that somebody pays the bill . No programs are " free . " If the expense of broadcasting a program is not paid by a commercial sponsor , it is paid by the owner of the station , who thereby becomes its " sponsor . " So the arbitrary designation by the Commission of " sustaining " and " commercial " is actually meaningless , especially to the listener . ( Cf. " The People Look at Radio , " University of North Carolina Press , edited by Lazarsfeld and Field and based on a nationwide survey of radio listeners conducted by the National Opinion Research Center of the University of Denver . One person out of every five interviewed believed that all radio programs were sold to advertisers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justifiable reason for the Commission to insist on a fixed percentage of " sustaining " time . Action of the Coinmission in so doing results in : a ) a violation of the Communications Act b ) unwarranted regulation over the business of the licensee c ) unauthorized interference with the licensee 's control over program content Therefore , this bill should specifically prevent the Commission from interfering in any way with the business problems of broadcasting under the American system of free and competitive enterprise . Such a specific prohibition upon the Commission is believed necessary because otherwise ,  | their interference will result in confusion and chaos . It is obvious , I believe , that commercial problems in the American economic system and within the radio industry are constantly shifting and changing . For example , we are now witnessing what has been termed an " economic revolution " in some of our southern states . Wages and salaries , terms and conditions of employment , the number and size and character of advertising sponsors , the number and character of competitive advertising media ? these and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radically within recent years and are still changing . Is it not unreasonable to expect that a broadcast licensee should still maintain the exact methods of doing business under these new conditions that he was able to maintain when he first applied for his broadcast license many years ago ? Or , to take another example , what of the licensee who obtained his license many years ago in a city like Los Angeles , only to find in the intervening years that the population of that city has increased by 100 per cent , that living conditions , business conditions , advertising practices , - ompetition , radio listening habits and many other factors have changed so radically that there is hardly any resemblance between the city in which he began operations , and the city in which he is now forced to observe the same conditions that were set forth in his original application ? Some opponents of the American system of radio broadcasting have pointed to the prosperity of broadcasters as evidence that the Commission should have power to regulate their business . The Commission itself in some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It should be pointed out , however , that the profit figures which are cited in such instances are based on earnings generally in the period of 1940 to 1945 ? those years immediately before and during the war when nearly all American business enterprises enjoyed unprecedented prosperity ( and when such profits were largely drained off anyway by excess profits taxes of about 90% ) . This was , furthermore , a period when the licensing and construction of new broadcast stations were " frozen . " This meant that the relatively few existing stations enjoyed an abnormal prosperity . But one does not find these opponents or critics of the American system citing the income figures of broadcast stations , say , for the period of 1930-40 , when many stations operated at a loss , and when some were forced out of business . Nor do these critics take into account the fact that since the " freeze " on licenses and construction of new stations has been removed , literally thousands of new competitors have appeared on the American broadcasting scene . It is confidently predicted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AM , FM , television , facsimile and other forms of broadcasting . This will inevitably have a profound effect upon  | the business of broadcasting in the years to come , and constitutes a compelling reason for preventing the Commission from interfering with or regulating the business of the licensee . The Commission 's argument in justification of its interference with the business of broadcasting , has been the assertion that it exercises jurisdiction over a scarce commodity ? the limited number of radio frequencies available to any single community . Now , as a matter of fact , the simple and historic economic factor of ability to operate at a profit is a more sound and effective control over a commodity that is no longer scarce , than would be the Commission 's interference or regulation . Under old Commission standards it was often true that the number of radio broadcast frequencies available to any single community was limited . But this is no longer true . With AM and FM and television and facsimile , there are now more radio facilities available to any market than the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach the Commission with an application for a license until they have first made sure , by their own independent study , that the market in question gives reasonable promise of being able to support the new enterprise . For that same reason , applications submitted to the Commission have subsequently been withdrawn . Also for that same reason , hundreds of available FM facilities are still going begging , despite all the pressure put upon AM broadcasters by the Commission to apply for them and despite all the encouragement the Commission has been trying to give to entrepreneurs outside the radio industry , by articles and speeches pointing to the high profits that some broadcasters have made during the recent lush years . For example , we may point to Gadsden , Alabama , a city of only 36,000 population , which formerly had only one radio station , but now has five . ( ) r Phoenix , Arizona , a city of 65,000 people , where formerly there were two stations and now there are six , plus another two in nearby Mesa which also cover Phoenix , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point to our own city of Washington , D. C. , where until a few years ago we had only six radio stations . But now , counting the new stations that the Cornmission has licensed within the District as well as in the nearby suburbs - stations that deliver a very good signal to the residents of the District ? we can count thirteen AM stations , 11 FM stations and four television stations already licensed or with construction permits ? a total of 28 radio broadcasting enterprises where formerly there were only six . In the face of these facts , surely the old argument of " regulation because of scarcity " will hardly hold water . For reasons given above it is believed that the legitimate limiting ( Actor in broadcasting should be the economic factor operating in its  | normal American way , rather than the unauthorized , unwarranted , unrealistic and disruptive factor of interference by the Commission with the business of the broadcast licensee . Further , and parallel , evidence to support this request for specific language in the Act to prohibit the Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commission 's prevailing practice of requiring the licensee to devote a stated percentage of his time to various types of programs , including such categories as education , religion , agriculture , news , entertainment , fraternal , etc . Yet the nature and the needs of the community may change completely over the years . The character of the population may change . Local customs and institutions may change . What was once a definite need in the community , to be served by the broadcaster , may have become a surfeit , and the licensee may be powerless to supply a new need of the community because of the arbitrary limitations and antiquated obligations imposed upon him . Again , he can petition the Commission for relief or for permission to change his arbitrary table of percentages , but this takes time , may involve some expensive hearings , and forces the Commission to investigate the economic factors involved which are , and should be , outside their jurisdiction . This inability of the licensee to remain flexible , to serve his listeners to the best of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may have a profound effect upon his business . It may deprive him of listeners and thus of the means of obtaining the advertising revenue necessary to support his operation ; it may play into the hands of a competitor who is not thus artificially restrained by the Commission . It places an unnecessary and unfair hardship upon the licensee . This bill should specifically prevent the Commission from requiring any such arbitrary division of program time into stated categories . In its prevailing practice of regulating the business of broadcasting the Commission is also making use of certain arbitrary definitions , yardsticks or rules-of-thumb which work a hardship on the licensee . For example , under the present system , when a broadcaster submits his program report as required by the Commission , any program in which one commercial announcement appears is counted as a " commercial program , " even though that announcement takes up only a few seconds of a l5-minute program . This , roughly , would be comparable to stating that a full page of a newspaper is " commercial " if only small advertisement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitrary rulings or interpretations the broadcast licensee must cope with at present . By specifically preventing the Commission from assuming any control or regulation over the business of  | broadcasting , this Act would render a great service to the American radio system . The Commission now requires a station to submit numerous lengthy and involved reports , disclosing in minute detail all of its earnings and expenses . Other reports are required , disclosing complete information regarding programs . Yet , under the Act , the Commission has no authority to require this type of information . If the Commission has no use for this material , why should it place such a burden upon broadcasting stations ? The man-hours required to keep and compile such reports , the accounting system required by the Commission in order to submit the information in specified form , and the extra expense involved in this year-round compliance is an unnecessary burden upon all stations , especially upon the smaller stations with limited personnel and income . It is therefore respectfully urged that this bill specifically prohibit the Commission from requiring such irrelevant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , insofar as it seeks to amend Section 3 of the Act , adding subsection ( dd ) , to define a " Network organization " as meaning " any person who sells or clears time . . . for the presentation of programs , produced either by itself or others , to be broadcast simultaneously over more than one broadcast station irrespective of the means employed . . . ; but shall not include advertising agencies or persons who contract directly with the licensee or broadcast station for broadcast time for their own use . " It is believed that such language would cover the many firms of national radio sales representatives who have been in business for many years and who render a necessary and valuable service , yet who should not be subject to network controls because they by no means perform the functions or occupy the place of a network , and actually are no more than sales agents for the stations they represent . Such language also covers the individual licensee who has an AM station and an FM station which broadcast some programs simultaneously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undoubtedly will be hundreds more , it is extremely doubtful if it is the intention of the Congress to require these hundreds of licensees to be considered as " networks . " Such language also covers many situations of dual ownership that now exist , much as one in Nebraska , where station WOW in Omaha , for example , is connected by line with station KODY in North Platte , for the simultaneous broadcast of some programs . Both stations are owned by the same corporation , WOW being the principal outlet and KODY being a satellite station to complete the market coverage picture of WOW , and in this sense is considered as a " bonus " or a " booster " station . Yet under the language of this bill , that licensee would be a " network organization . "  | Presumably these licensees would be required to conform to all the Commission 's regulations respecting network organizations , including the keeping of special records , the filing of special reports , and numerous other burdensome obligations that might work an intolerable hardship in a direction not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This bill therefore should be revised to provide for such further exceptions . Section 15 of this bill is too restrictive , places undue restraint upon the licensee , and would serve to prevent him from operating in the public interest . This section proposed to amend Section 315 of the Act , subsection ( c ) , so as to limit the use of a station 's facilities during any political campaign to the candidate himself , or some person designated by said candidate , or by a political party whose candidate 's name appears on the ballot and those whose duly chosen responsible officers designate a person to use such facilities . Under the terms of this limiting language , some of those persons or organizations in a community , who may have a great stake in the election , would be prohibited by law from using radio facilities . Such organizations as the League of Women Voters , or the Parent-Teacher Association , or the School Board , or the Ministerial Alliance , or the Boy Scouts ? or any one of dozens of other worthy and responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inability to obtain the written endorsement of some candidate . Candidates and issues could not be impartially discussed . Thus would American political practices be reversed ; instead of the candidate seeking the endorsement of such civic organizations , as in the past , the organizations would have to curry the favor of the candidate and obtain his written endorsement in order to express their views or explain their convictions to the public . No such restrictions are placed upon newspapers or any other means of communication . Radio stations would be placed at an unfair competitive advantage . With the development of facsimile broadcasting , it is believed that for all practical purposes this part of the bill would be rendered inoperable by the First Amendment . It is respectfully urged therefore that the bill be revised to place within the exclusive control of the licensee the authority over all political and other programs to be broadcast over the facility he is licensed to operate . Subsection ( c ) of Section 15 , as proposed in this bill , is also restrictive and unfair inasmuch as it would prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Again , no such restriction is placed upon newspapers or other media . Facsimile broadcasting would present an insuperable problem of compliance in view of the First Amendment .  | The public interest would not be served . Stations which rely for a necessary portion of their revenue on the sale of time for political programs would be unfairly penalized by this substantial loss of income . Section 17 of this bill is contrary to the public interest , in that it specifically denies to broadcast licensees control over program content . In the language of the proposed new Section 330 of this Act , this bill would require a licensee to permit the broadcast of any program on a public or controversial question , merely provided it would not subject him " to liability for damages or to penalty of forfeiture under any local , State , or Federal law or regulation . " He is specifically denied the power to censor , alter , or in any manner to affect or control the substance of any program material so used . Subject to that narrow restriction of liability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent the broadcast of programs which , although stopping short of libel or slander , by ordinary standards of good taste might violate the sensibilities of large numbers of listeners ; might subject the licensee to abuse , scorn or ridicule by his listeners ; might result in the loss of business through cancellation of contracts , expiration of contracts and failure to renew , or simply in the failure of prospective advertisers to use the facilities of the station . It is respectfully submitted that the most priceless possession of the licensee is the goodwill of his listeners . Upon that intangible , sensitive , delicate and highly mutable thread hangs the very existence of the broadcasting station . Yet the licensee would be powerless to protect the goodwill of his station against those who could use its facilities in the manner described under Section 17 of this hill . Such persons would in every case ? or certainly in nearly every case ? be " special pleaders " because they would be appearing on behalf of a political candidate or on either side of a public issue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented . The standards of good taste that the station might have carefully and painstakingly built up over a period of many years , the broadcasting policies the station might have established after long experience , these would mean nothing to the occasional user of the station , who might , indeed , be making his first and last appearance before that microphone . While his script might contain nothing in the nature of libel or slander , or anything that could definitely be said to put the licensee in danger of penalty or forfeit under the law , it might he shot through with statements completely out of keeping with the character of the station and its listening audience , with half-truths , with vulgarisms , with remarks that would antagonize , or inflame , or disgust large segments of the station 's audience .  | In fact , the author of this bill apparently recognizes the need for the licensee to be able to protect himself , his station and his audience , because in Section 19 of this bill , it is proposed to add the following subsection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is affiliated , by prohibiting " any contract , arrangement , or understanding , express or implied , with a network organization , " " ( 5 ) which prevents the station from rejecting or refusing network programs which the station reasonably believes to be unsatisfactory , unsuitable , or contrary to the public interest , or from substituting a program of outstanding local or national importance for any offered by the network ; " ( emphasis supplied ) . In other words , if this bill is careful to protect the licensee against his own network , which has a definite stake in the success of his station and the goodwill it has built , why should it not be equally zealous to protect him against the casual user , the special pleader with no stake at all in his station or in the goodwill of his listening audience ? If the licensee is considered by the author of this bill to be a competent judge in rejecting network programs which he reasonably believes to be unsatisfactory , unsuitable , or contrary to the public interest , why is he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to program material submitted not by a network , which from a practical standpoint would hardly have any ulterior motives to serve in his market , but submitted by an infrequent and inexperienced user of radio , a special pleader with a definite axe to grind , and to whom the welfare of the station is surely secondary , at best ? Therefore we urge that the Congress give to the licensee the power to control the content of every program broadcast over his station ; the power to censor any speech or other material in the light of the public interest , good taste , established station policies , and all other proper considerations that would be consonant with the licensee 's stewardship of the facility under his charge . In summary , then , I respectfully submit : That this bill should specifically and unqualifiedly prohibit the Com-mission from interfering with the business of the broadcast licensee . The Commission should be prevented from requiring arbitrary commitments for dividing time into commercial or sustaining , or with respect to program content , and from requiring irrelevant and burdensome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " network organization " should be revised to exclude national radio sales representatives , operators of AM-FM stations , and certain other types of dual-station operators which  | are not in effect and are not intended to be network organizations . The broadcast licensee should be given complete and exclusive control over program content , including the sole right to determine who shall speak , and the right to censor any material intended for broadcast . No arbitrary time-ban should be placed upon any type of program to radio 's competitive disadvantage . In his business operations as well as in program control , the broadcaster should truly and effectively be set free .  | I SPEAK to you from over twenty years of experience in building and producing radio programs , both local and network , including twelve years as program manager of one of the largest and most active broadcasting stations in the Middle West , WHO , Des Moines . I wish to speak on the following sections of S. 1333 , known as the White Bill . S. 1333 . Sec. 9(b) . This section will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission , subject to limitations of the Act , to grant a license when public convenience , interest , and necessity will be served thereby . The lack of definition of the term " public convenience , interest and necessity " has presented broadcasters with an ever-present ambiguity , which has invited misinterpretation and therefore invasion of the licensee 's complete right to control the character and substance of his programs . Section 9(b) of S. 1333 adds that the Commission shall distribute licenses , frequencies , and hours of operation and power among the several states and communities so as to provide fair , efficient and equitable distribution of radio service , giving effect in each instance to the needs and requirements thereof . Here again , in the word " service " there is ambiguity , which through the same misinterpretation could be construed to mean " program service . " It has seemed inadvisable or impossible to define the term " public interest , convenience and necessity " but in this instance , if our assumption is correct that both terms apply only to technical facilities ? that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to broadcast an adequate signal in a given area ? then such a definition could and should be included in Paragraph ( b ) , making perfectly clear the meaning of the word " service . " In this context , it is possible that the term " public interest , convenience and necessity " would assume the same connotation and to that extent at least remove the threat of increased control of program content by the Commission . S. 1333 . Section 14 ( a ) . This provides that : " Any station license may be revoked ( 1 ) because of conditions coming to the attention of the Commission since the granting of such license which would have warranted the Commission in refusing to grant such a license . " This presupposes that the license was granted partially on the basis of proposed or promised program policies contained in the original application . Strict application of this provision would restrict materially deviation from such policies even though in the opinion of the licensee this deviation would be desirable and necessary from the standpoint of good programing . Conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could conceivably change during the period of the life of the license to such an extent that material changes in program policies would be desired or required . Changing economic conditions could seriously affect station programming . Available talent from local resources might alter or dwindle ; changes in the station program and production personnel might result in different program policies as skills and talent of new staff members varied . These and other perfectly normal developments might dictate deviation from original program plans , yet the possibility of negative or punitive action on the part of the Commission as a result , would he an inhibiting factor and tend to retard progress or advisable change in those previously established policies . S. 1333 . Section 15 ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( d ) . While all three of these paragraphs reflect recommendations in the proposed NAB Standards of Practices , now in the process of development , they seem to me to prescribe the station operator to an uncalled-for degree . The self-regulation which recommends equal time for all candidates is an agreement to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free expression . To my knowledge , no such law regulating newspapers exists . If we are in fact to emerge with a law which makes radio as free as the press , I believe these three paragraphs should be stricken . Furthermore , if we have , as we insist , the right to editorialize , these provisions make it mandatory for a licensee to provide free time for reply to any statement of opinion he or his editor might make over his own facilities o78 regarding a political or public controversy . Again , to my knowledge there is no such law regulating newspapers . S. 1333 . Section 15 ( c ) . The apparent intent of this paragraph is to protect the candidate from unauthorized attack , or support . Provision for this has been made in the proposed Standards of Practice . However , the language of this paragraph is so specific that if taken literally it would eliminate the presentation of a candidate 's case by any means other than a straight political speech . In the past such presentations have taken many other forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . The proposed NAB Standards of Practices also recommends a prohibition against dramatization of a political or public issue broadcast with the intent of keeping such broadcasts on an intellectual and thoughtful plane rather than appealing to emotions through dramatization . This is , however , entirely beside the point and the wording of Section 15(c) places a definite restriction on the manner or method of presenting political broadcasts . If the industry deems it advisable to make such a prohibition it falls rightfully within the realm of self-regulation for the reasons stated above . I do not believe such regulation has any place in this law . I believe that the wording of this paragraph should be changed to permit such programming . or the use of such techniques as are deemed advisable so long as they are not misleading to the public , and conform in every other respect to the law . A further , and more serious objection to this Section 15(c) is the fact that it prohibits any responsible citizen or group from voicing an opinion on such matters without written authorization from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Parent Teachers Association could and should be vitally interested in candidates for the local school board , regardless of political affiliation . Such a group would be in a position to know the duties and qualifications of a board member , and their opinions , as voiced by their spokesmen , would be of sound value . Yet this law clearly and unequivocally prevents them from using the air for such a purpose . S. 1333 . Section 16 ( b ) . This section , which amends Section 326 of the 1934 Act , states unequivocally that the Commission shall have no power to censor , alter , affect or control the substance of program material broadcast by a licensee . However , the same paragraph , ( b ) , gives the Commission unlimited authority to determine whether or not an applicant has operated in the public interest . I realize that a definition of the term " public interest , convenience , and necessity " is difficult or virtually impossible to achieve . Therefore , the  | present bill retains this ambiguity which permits such elasticity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wording I can see no reason to expect relief from those philosophies of the Commission already expressed in the Blue Book , other than that relief provided by review and hearings before the Commission or the courts . Of equal or greater importance , in my mind , is the fact that the new bill accepts this philosophy and in so doing constitutes a continued threat to the fundamental right of freedom of speech . There is no question as to the reaction of station managers and program managers to these implications . It is only natural that program policies will be formulated that will tend to conform to these philosophies already expounded by the Commission in the Blue Book . Even in my own experience as a program manager , I have many times seen programs of doubtful quality and effectiveness given time on the air simply because they would improve the appearance of the station 's program record if and when examined by the Commission . S. 1333 . Section 17 . My thinking on Section 15(a) , ( b ) and ( d ) as expressed earlier in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this section preceding the first proviso .  | I AM Vice President and Treasurer of The Fort Industry Company which operates radio stations in the middle west and south . I should like to qualify myself today as a witness principally as former assistant director of the Office of Censorship , during the war , and only secondarily as a broadcast licensee . In the former experience , I served as assistant director in charge of the Broadcasting Division under Byron Price , director , from December , 1941 to April , 1944 ? subsequently serving for fifteen months as president of the National Association of Broadcasters . My references in testifying are particularly to Section 18 of the bill , which provides an amendment to Section 332(a) of the Communications Act of 1934 ; and to Section 16 of the proposed bill , which amends Section 326(a) of the Communications Act . SECTION 18 ? This section of S. 1333 is entitled " Identification of source in news broadcasts . " I should like to say as one who has had experience as a censor during time of war ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our free media legal in the United States ? that Section 18 of S. 1333 is harsher as an instrument of censorship than was the code of wartime practices issued by the Office of Censorship during the war , and by terms of which broadcasters voluntarily governed their operations against releasing information of value to the enemy . The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States  | entrusted the censorship of communications to the Office of Censorship . At no time did the Office of Censorship impose any such far-reaching restrictions as identification of source upon any media . During the war , as a matter of fact , we undertook to pursue a policy diametrically opposed to this ? for the reason that we felt a practical and workable system of censorship could be evolved , on a voluntary basis , which would forward the aims of our armed forces and , at the same time , not do permanent damage to one of our most important Constitutional guaranties : freedom of expression . The code of wartime practices for American broadcasters , referred to above , asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadcast over their facilities during the conflict ; it requested that stations be prepared to delete such information as was defined in the code with one exception ? where such information was released by an appropriate authority . An appropriate authority , for example , would have been General Marshall , who , it was presumed by the Office of Censorship , could and would weigh the values of national security before releasing any statement of implied military significance to the enemy . Consequently , there were frequent conferences when some persons in high positions during the war gave newspaper and radio correspondents background information which they felt could be broadcast or published , without attribution , in the best interests of forwarding the cause of victory . We knew of these instances in the Office of Censorship and we did not require correspondents to identify the source of such material . I should like to testify to the great success of the voluntary system of censorship which was originated and blueprinted by Byron Price . Among broadcasters there was no single instance in which the licensee of a broadcast station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wartime practices . To set up , in peacetime , a censorship of our greatest means of mass communication that is more severe and restrictive than any censorship observed during wartime is unthinkable and can be fraught with the most dangerous results . I earnestly appeal for the elimination of Section 332(a) and ( b ) as amended in its entirety . I should like to quote also , in this regard , from a book Weapon of Silence , written by Theodore F. Koop , who served during the war both in a civilian and military capacity as an executive assistant to Byron Price at the Office of Censorship . On page 188 of that book in a sentence concluding a chapter on the activities of the Broadcasting Division , Mr. Koop writes : " Thanks in no small part to Byron Price , as well as to its own members , the broadcasting  | industry was able to stand before freedom-loving America on an equal footing with the press . " SECTION 16 ? It is my belief that anything in this Section that anywise impairs freedom of speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire nation and should be eliminated . I , consequently , find objection to the phrase , " the substance of any material , " etc. because I believe this will be greatly misunderstood and I am sure , from past observation , that it is subject to diverse interpretations . I also feel that the right and duty of the licensee of such radio stations to determine the character and source of material to be broadcast should not be given " subject to the limitation of this Act , " and that , consequently , the quoted phrase should be eliminated . I note with much concern that any mention of the right of free speech which appeared in this original section has been eliminated , and for the sense of security and for reasons of clarity this phrase should be restored to this section . As for the last proviso , " that nothing herein contained shall be construed to limit the authority of the Commission in its consideration of applications for renewal of licenses to determine whether or not the licensee has operated in the public interest " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b ) as amended by Section 14 of the proposed bill , the Federal Communications Commission is given the right to serve upon the licensee a cease-and-desist order regarding any action of the licensee in violation of any rule or regulation of the Commission authorized by this Act . The proviso to which I object has been the means by which the Commission has assumed to exercise control and censorship over the programs of radio stations , and has been the means by which such pseudo-regulations as the Blue Book have been promulgated . Consequently , to protect the broadcasters ' right of freedom of speech as custodians for the people , and to provide against any misunderstanding or any inclination on the part of any body regulating radio broadcasting to assume unto itself powers not expressly given to it , this proviso should be eliminated . As a long-time broadcaster , I have always believed that radio must be as free as the press . The guarantee of freedom of speech in the First Amendment to the Constitution , I believe , applies just as thoroughly to the spoken word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safeguards of radio legislation give as great a freedom to broadcasting as is given to the press , then ultimately freedom of speech , as we know it in the press , will be assailed and weakened . This becomes especially evident when we consider facsimile , which ultimately may result in a newspaper of the air produced by electrical impulses , and which will come under the jurisdiction and the regulatory  | power of government , just as broadcasting does today . If , therefore , the amendments to the existing Communications Act do not clearly assure freedom of broadcasting , they may serve as an entering wedge against our traditional freedom of the press , which has been maintained by such costly and determined efforts .  | I AM , and have been for eight years , a director of the National Association of Broadcasters . I am a director of The Advertising Council . I am a director of Broadcast Music , Inc. and I am Chairman of the Stations Planning and Advisory Committee , representing independent stations which are affiliated with the National Broadcasting Company . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today as Vice President of the Travelers Broadcasting Service Corporation and General Manager of WTIC . While there are many sections of the bill with which I am not in accord , I would like to speak specifically on the following sections : first , Section 17 , which amends Part 1 of Title III of the Communications Act of 1934 ; second , Section 18 of the White Bill , amending Part 1 of Title III of the Act . This section is titled " Identification of Source in News Broadcasts . " Finally , I should like to speak to Section 19 of the bill which also amends Part 1 of Title III of the ' 34 Act and which section is entitled , " Limitations on Chain Broadcasting and Station Ownership . " The proposed Section 330 of Section 17 seems to me impractical in operation because of the proviso starting in line 12 , " That the time , in the aggregate , devoted to different views on any such question shall not be required to exceed twice that which was made available to the original user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double the amount of time which any radio station would have to allocate to the discussion of any public question . All radio stations at present operate on the principle that  | both sides of a public or controversial question shall receive equal treatment , and as there are usually two substantially opposing views on any public question , two broadcasts on that subject virtually covers the subject . It seems to me that under this provision ? as above quoted ? the door would be wide open for innumerable facets of opinion to demand time for the presentation of a view which might very well differ in such a minor degree as to be inconsequential to the main issue . Again , if two opposite viewpoints are permitted to broadcast to counter the original broadcast from the proponent , I would assume , in all fairness , that the proponent would again have the right to present another broadcast to equalize the time . And , if during this broadcast , there was presented a small difference in viewpoint from the original broadcast , then the door would be open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of procedure under this provision would be to place the power of enforcement in the hands of the Federal Communications Commission , since I assume that any complaints of non-compliance with the provision would be addressed to that body . Because the broadcaster would have no way of knowing what the Commission would consider important or unimportant , and could have no previous knowledge as to what a decision might be , he would be in an unenviable position in judging his operation . The ultimate end of such a provision might well be to curtail the discussion of public questions rather than to encourage them . In times like these , when it is so important for people to be informed on all the important questions of the day , public discussion should be encouraged by all practical means and not discouraged . It might very easily have an effect directly opposite to that which is intended . This provision might well require a broadcaster to devote entirely too much time to a subject which was of minor importance to the public , to the detriment of the presentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to be devoted to a single subject without regard to its importance . Proposed Section 331 , also a part of Section 17 , requires an immense amount of detail . It requires that before a broadcaster may permit the use of his station for a presentation of any public or political questions under Section 315 or 330 , he must procure in writing from the person or persons arranging or contracting for the broadcast time ( a ) the name of the speaker or speakers ; ( b ) the subject of the discussion ; ( c ) the capacity in which the speaker or speakers appear ; that is , whether on their own account as an individual candidate or public officer , or as the representative , advocate , or employee of another ; and how the time for the broadcast was made available , and if paid for , by whom . All of this information must be announced at the beginning and end of each broadcast .  | During political campaigns , it is not unusual for a political party to use five-minute broadcasts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this proviso , most of that five-minute period would be devoted to comply with this provision to the great detriment of the speaker , his cause and the public . The speaker would have paid for time on which he could not propound his views and the public would merely be hearing two lengthy and repetitious announcements . Even on quarter-hour programs , particularly where more than one speaker was involved , this requirement would be very onerous and wholly impractical . Radio stations at the present time fully identify speakers , parties and subject-matter , but not in anything like the detail required by this provision . I assume that the objective here is to provide the listener with sufficient information so that there will be no possible deception . I feel that that is adequately covered in the present Act and by the voluntary custom and tradition within the industry . There is a further provision in this section , relating to the case of a public officer , where the announcements are not quite so detailed but still require the announcement at the beginning and end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the office is elective or appointive , and the political unit or political officer involved in the election or appointment . A great many stations have regular programs each week from their Representatives , Senators , Governors and locally elected and appointed officers . It would be extremely onerous to have to follow this procedure as outlined for broadcasts covering such well-known figures as Senators , Governors and local officials . I come now to Section 18 of the bill and proposed Section 332(a) ? " Identification of Source in News Broadcasts . " The first sentence of this section reads as follows : " All news items or the discussion of current events broadcast by any radio broadcast station shall be identified generally as to source and all editorial or interpretative comment , if any , concerning such items or events shall be identified as such and as to source and responsibility . " This part of Section 332(a) would directly limit the ability of any radio news reporter to gather news . For instance , as soon as the fact were known that every news broadcast had by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately important sources of news would dry up as far as radio was concerned . This is a point on which news reporters have gone to jail ; have suffered rather than reveal the source of their news . Hundreds of radio stations , realizing their responsibility in the dissemination of local news , have their own local and regional news reporters , as we  | do at WTIC . We have legislative reporters in Connecticut , and our reporters , if they were to be required to identify all the sources of their news , would be immediately handicapped in a competitive way in delivering our listeners the same news that the newspapers would be able to deliver to their readers . This is a clear discrimination as between media , and would place radio at a distinct disadvantage in its reportorial function . More than that , responsible surveys now show that 64% of all of our people get most of their news from radio , and to place such a limitation upon our reporters who gather and disseminate the news is a public disservice and I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition to the fact that it would cut down news service to the people , the provision , in my opinion , is impractical . It would require frequent interruption of news broadcasts to identify sources , to the complete confusion of the listener . At WTIC , our present custom is to announce at the conclusion of each news broadcast the fact that our broadcasts are made up from dispatches from Associated Press , International News Service , Transradio and our own reporters , and this is a practice generally followed by radio stations throughout the country . More detailed and specific disclosure of sources than this would run into the objections which I have outlined . The last part of my testimony concerns Section 19 of the bill , entitled " Limitations on Chain Broadcasting and Station Ownership " ? the proposed Section 333 . I do n't believe that contractual relations between a network and an independent station should be made the subject of legislation . The result will be an inflexible set of rules which will certainly not conform to the rapidly changing needs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as facsimile , frequency modulation and television , and no expert could write statutory provisions of this kind which would be just and equitable for all segments of the broadcasting industry . Part 4 of Section 19 , under ( a ) , reads : " which gives any network organization an option upon periods of time which are unspecified or which gives one or more network organizations options upon specified periods of time totaling more than 50 per centum of the total number of hours for which the station is licensed to operate or upon a total of more than two hours in any consecutive three-hour period . - . " As I understand Part 4 , all independent stations licensed to operate 24 hours a day would be permitted to option to one or more networks 50% of that 24-hour period ? or 12 hours . This is more than the present regulations allow , and any regulation which permits the network to demand more time on option is , to my mind , detrimental to the best interests of the independent stations and the service which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is particularly important at the present time because of the increased number of stations , which fact gives the networks more stations to choose between and , consequently , increased bargaining power . The present regulation covering option time which has been in force for the last few years has , in my opinion , worked out very well and allows flexibility in the arrangement of program schedules . In addition , this regulation has allowed sufficient time at peak listening hours for local stations to do a perfectly adequate job for their local audiences . I feel that the suggested provision would hamper the presentation of the best programs at the most suitable times . In conclusion , my general comment on the provisions which I have discussed is that they are detrimental to good community and regional operation because they take away from the flexibility of the individual broadcaster 's operation . Flexibility ? and in flexibility , I include timeliness ? is one of the great public assets of radio and each step toward inflexibility makes for poorer not better service to the listener .  | AM a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Broadcasters . In reference to Section 8(j) of the bill , which amends subsection ( j ) of Section 303 of the Act ? such amendment provides that uniform systems of financial reports may be required from the licensee of each station doing a particular type of broadcasting , which reports shall disclose the financial statements of any such radio organizations ; and further provides that this information may be used by the Commission on its order " in any proceeding before the Commission . " This bill seeks to prohibit the Commission from regulating the business management of any radio station or to fix or regulate rates charged by any station . The filing of such detailed financial reports is , therefore , unnecessary . Stations are not common carriers , and this detailed information of a confidential financial nature is not within the scope or province of the Commission . Further , the amendment gives the right of the Commission to make such information public in any hearing or proceeding of any kind before the Commission , which could act to the damage of the station and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the contrary , should carry a provision prohibiting the Commisson from inquiring into the financial affairs of licensees , or requiring regular financial reports , as contemplated in the amendment ; and stipulate that only such financial information be furnished as is necessary to convince the Commission , in the case of an applicant , that it is financially  | qualified to carry out the terms of the license sought ; or , at renewal time , to review the financial condition of the licensee to the extent that it may determine if it is still financially sound and able to discharge its obligations under the terms of its license . Any further information of this character is unnecessary and against the spirit and provisions of Section 16 of the bill limiting the Commission 's powers in regard to regulation of the business of the licensee . Further , a provision should be written into the bill requiring the Commission to keep all such information as may be necessary to it to determine financial responsibility in the case of a grant or a renewal confidential at all times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Section 307 of the Act , which is amended by Section 9 , subsection ( b ) of the bill , the final clause of the amendment , which reads " giving effect in each such instance to the needs and requirements thereof , " should be eliminated and the words " consistent with standards of good engineering practice " be substituted therefor . As it now reads , this last clause transfers the matter of station grants to a quasi common-carrier status and brings into the Commission 's decision factors of competition . The Commission would have to decide whether the grant would be proper to eliminate a condition of monopoly , or , on the converse , whether it should be denied because to grant same would create too much competition from an economic standpoint . Other sections of the bill do not give the Commission such powers . It would tend to regulate the business of broadcasting in any given community , and to regulate the business of broadcasting is to invoke the powers of censorship through the pocketbook ? which can be just as effective as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15(c) of the bill , which amends Section 315 of the Act , this amendment prohibits sale of time to individual citizens who wish to speak for or against the candidacy of an applicant for public office unless such individual is approved in writing as the spokesman or representative of a candidate . It also would act to prohibit the sale of time for the same purpose to organizations such as the Grange , the Farmers Union , the PAC , or any other organization of citizens who have a stake in an election but are neither the representatives of a candidate nor a recognized political party . These persons and individuals , under the general safeguards governing political campaigns , should not be denied a right to the air . This amendment should also be rewritten to define a legally qualified candidate or a political party as one which is legally qualified in the State in which the station is located . In connection with Section 15(d) of the bill , which amends Section 315  | of the Act , this subsection as amended is too vague . There might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shades of opinion in connection with a public measure to be voted on . How is it to be decided which person or organization shall give the " different " view in the event that fifty such persons make application to do so ? As written it could be interpreted that all who apply must be given equal opportunity to air their different views . This provision might well result in no discussion of the matter on the air as a defense measure on the part of the station to avoid excessive time being allotted , and putting the over-all program structure of the station badly out of balance , to the detriment and annoyance of the listeners . In reference to Section 15(e) of the bill , which amends Section 315 of the Act , there is no valid reason whatever why political broadcasts should not be made the day before an election . Interest in an election is highest the final day of the campaign ; listeners are most receptive to political messages at that time and they are most appropriate in the program structure . As most elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell time for political programs on Sunday ? nor do candidates wish to buy time on Sunday ? this amendment , in many instances , would mean that the last broadcasts of a political campaign would be three days before the election ? on the previous Saturday . It appears to this witness that such a restriction is in violation of the rights of free speech , as it says , in effect , " you can talk on certain days but you can not talk on one day . " It also is discriminatory against broadcasting as no other method of reaching the public is so restricted ? newspapers , public meetings , billboards , films and the like being permitted under our laws to give political messages to the people on any day and at any time . In reference to Section 15(g) of the bill , which amends Section 315 of the Act , the wording of this amendment is too vague and general . The word " approximate " in reference to the time of the day or night is too general and hard to administer by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time should be spelled out more precisely , by stipulating segments of the broadcast day that follow industry practice as to " equal time , " such as time between the hours of 8 a.m. to 12 noon , 12 to 6 p.m. and 6 to 11 p.m. , with the proviso that any equal segment of time within these time divisions be considered " equal " from the standpoint of the amendment . It should also be provided that equal opportunity can be accorded by the station by allotting equal time as defined above on any day or night of the week of the campaign , with the exception of the final and last day of the campaign when the equality of time would have to be observed on the same day , within the same time division .  | In reference to Section 17 , Part 1 of Title III of the Act , which is amended by adding two new sections entitled " Discussion of Public or Political Questions , " this section seems to be vaguely written and , therefore , subject to conflicting interpretation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is meant that , aside from giving the licensee the right to delete slander , libel , obscene or indecent statements and the like , he can not otherwise alter or change the text once he has agreed to broadcast such a talk or program , then the word " context " should be substituted for the word " substance . " These sections further put the burden of deciding what constitutes libel or slander , or the like , on the licensee . If he decides in conflict with the opinion of the person or organization seeking to broadcast the statements and he deletes same according to his , the licensee 's , best judgment , then the licensee may find himself faced with a complaint to the Commission which , in turn , will find itself faced with making a judicial decision as to whether the items did indeed constitute libel , slander , or the like . At the least , the licensee , in agreeing to permit each such public or political question broadcast under the terms of these new sections , runs the hazard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiety and loss of prestige in his community . The practical result of these provisions , as previously written , will ? in this witness 's opinion ? tend to diminish instead of increase the airing of public questions . To accomplish the results sought by these new sections , safeguarding provisions should be written into the section saving the licensee harmless from libel and slander damages , exactly as is provided in the sections dealing with talks of candidates for political office . If this is not done , then the licensee should be given the specific right to cut the speaker off the air if he departs from his prepared speech after it has been cleared for slander , libel and the like by the station management . In the past it has happened that a speaker , who had previously submitted a written copy of his talk that contained no statements that were illegal , suddenly , while broadcasting , departed therefrom and uttered slanderous and libelous statements . The station is then put into a difficult and dangerous position . Either the licensee should be protected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the station should be permitted by the bill to cut the speaker off the air if he departs from the written speech as submitted to the station in advance .  | THE proposed changes in and additions to Section 315 and other related sections need considerable scrutiny and clarification . Section 315 of the Communications Act of 1934 provides for " equal opportunities " for duly qualified candidates for political office only , with no censorship . The proposed changes and additions contained in Bill H.R. 3595 and S. 1333 give the same rights and privileges to representatives of candidates and to regularly organized political parties in a political campaign ; also to both sides in any public measures to be voted upon . Paragraph ( c ) , Section 315 , proposes that " No licensee shall , during a political campaign , permit the use of the facilities of a broadcast station for or against any candidate for any public office except ( 1 ) by a legally qualified candidate for the same office ; or ( 2 ) by a person designated , in writing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly organized political party whose candidate 's or candidates ' names appear on the ballot and whose duly chosen responsible officers designate a person to use such facilities . " ( Subparagraph ( 3 ) can not apply in primary elections . ) What about persons whose names do not appear on the ballot ? being prohibited by law , as in some states ? but who are the candidates of their party ? I refer to the Communist Party candidates particularly . In some states " write-ins " are legalized . This is a point that should be clarified so that the licensee can definitely determine the status of such candidates . Paragraph ( f ) , Section 315 , proposes , " Neither licensees nor the Commission shall have power of censorship over the material broadcast under  | the provisions of this section : Provided , that licensees shall not be held liable for any libel , slander , invasion of rights of privacy , or any similar liability imposed by any State , Federal or Territorial or local law for any statement made in any broadcast under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the licensee or persons under his control . " ( This last sentence seems superfluous , as the licensee as such is prohibited from making any statements under the provisions of this section . ) Is the licensee fully protected by paragraph ( f ) from criminal or civil liability in States where laws are in force prohibiting libel and slander from being broadcast over the radio ? I would suggest that copies of all talks should be in the hands of the radio station authorities at least twenty-four hours before the time set for the broadcast ? forty-eight hours would be preferable ? so as to give the speaker sufficient time to make changes or corrections , and to delete profane , obscene , or indecent language . Paragraph ( b ) , Section 326 , proposes , " The Commission shall have no power to censor , alter , or in any manner affect or control the substance of any material to be broadcast by any radio broadcast station licensed pursuant to this Act , and no regulation or condition shall be promulgated or imposed by the Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licensee of any such station to determine , subject to the limitations of this Act , the character and source of the material to be broadcast : Provided , that nothing herein contained shall be construed to limit the authority of the Commission in its consideration of applications for renewal of licenses to determine whether or not the licensee has operated in the public interest . " I would say it would be better if the Commission would immediately inform the licensee of any violation either by commission or omission and ask for an explanation and correct its practices , rather than let it go until the term of the license is about to expire . The licensee might be ignorant of any violations , and it would be rather severe to punish him by depriving him of his opportunity for a livelihood and his investment , while perhaps not being wilfully guilty of any violations of the law or regulations . Section 330 proposes , " When and if a radio broadcast station is used for the presentation of political or public questions otherwise than as provided for in Section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licensee of any such station to afford equal opportunities for the presentation of different views on such questions . " It provides , among other things , that neither the licensee nor the Commission shall have the power to censor , alter , or in any manner affect or control the substance of any program material . It also  | provides , " That no licensee shall be required to permit the broadcasting of any material which advocates the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force or violence . " It provides further , " That no licensee shall be required to broadcast any material which might subject the licensee to liability for damages or to penalty or forfeiture under any local , State , or Federal law or regulation . " It also provides that the licensee shall have the right to demand and receive a complete and accurate copy of the material to be broadcast a sufficient time in advance of its intended use to permit an examination thereof and the deletion therefrom of any material necessary to conform the same to the requirements of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are the " political or public " questions other than those provided for in Section 315 ? Would Communism be one of them ? If so , must the licensee give time to the Communists or any of their related organizations , such as the fellow travelers and underground workers ? Must they ( the Communists , etc. ) actually say they will if they can overthrow the form of government of the United States before the licensee can claim the right to refuse them the use of his radio facilities ? There are those who claim that the right to overthrow or abolish the form of government of the United States is provided for in the U. S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights ; but there is no such provision in the Constitution or the Bill of Rights . There is a provision in the Declaration of Independence that peoples have the right to change their form of government or to abolish it . But that was written years before the Constitution or the Bill of Rights . It was written when a foreign power governed the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was written and approved was achieved at Yorktown , Va. , in 1781 , and confirmed in Paris in 1783 ; and subversive elements should not be aided in any manner in nullifying the great accomplishments for which so many sacrificed their all . Radio facilities should be denied them in the promotion of their designs . One part of this Section 330 prevents the licensee and the Commission from censoring , altering , or in any manner affecting or controlling the substance of any program material , while another part of the section gives the licensee the right to demand and receive a complete and accurate copy of the material to be broadcast a sufficient time in advance of its intended use to permit an examination thereof and the deletion therefrom of any material necessary to conform the same to the requirements of this section . Those two parts of Section 330 seem to be contradictory .  | after all , we strive always to attract listeners . If enough people are interested in any question , we 'll do something about it ; and of course , we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to clutter up the airways with long-winded dissertations , pro and con , on the love-life of the Hottentots or on someone 's ideas as to how every one can make a thousand dollars a day without working . If the licensee is worthy of a license in the first place , then he should be trusted to decide whether or not an issue is of sufficient importance and interest to warrant time on his station . But it should be made crystal clear that there is no compulsion to throw open facilities . Permit me to cite a case showing how the lack of such a proviso has fostered bureaucracy . On my own station , for 27 years we have tried by every means at our disposal to run the finest kind of radio station , observing and exceeding both the letter and the spirit of " public interest , convenience and necessity . " I could submit a truck-load of testimonials from every walk of life which would attest to the fact that our efforts have been recognized . Yet , only a few months ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commissioners refused to cast his vote for renewal , but instead voted for " further inquiry " ? a fact which was widely publicized in the industry and which cast an unwarranted stain on a long and honorable record . Why did he do this ? He did it , as he informed our representative , because some 18 months previously we had become involved in one of those situations which are inevitable in broadcasting . A professor who is an eminent scientist from one of the mid-western universities had been invited by a local group to speak in my town . It was the sort of thing which happens every day . You can judge of the impact this visit made on our community by the fact that while we have a number of auditoriums which will hold from 5,000 to 15,000 people , the sponsors of this appearance scheduled it in a school auditorium , holding perhaps 1,500 people . And the professor failed to fill even this small hall . Yet , I was asked to cancel a full hour of superb NBC programming in the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits of a million people , and to chase off the majority of my vast audience , in order to carry this speech . Because I refused to do so , this group complained to the Commission . And based on that complaint , a Commissioner voted against renewing our license . This sort of thing has happened to others . I think any new law should so define responsibility that these things can not happen again , and I think that simplicity and clarity are needed in the law if these things are not to happen again . Here is another case in point : One of the most controversial issues now before us is the revision in the labor laws . My station has covered this  | subject , fully and dispassionately , in our newscasts . In addition , we carry , weekly , a program originating in Washington consisting of a round-table discussion by four Senators and our Washington correspondent , Blair Moody . This program covers all important legislation while it is in the making , and , always , Mr. Moody chooses two Senators on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these broadcasts have been devoted to labor laws . I am certain we have explored thoroughly the entire situation . Yet , last week I received several telegrams from both the CIO and the AFL asking me to carry programs protesting against the enactment of the Taft-Hartley Bill . Feeling that we have already covered the matter comprehensively and fairly , I refused to carry these programs , as to do so would have upset the balance maintained to date . I am certain we will be cited to the Commission as " unfair , " but the record will reveal we have been both fair and thorough . Yet I know one Commissioner who will not take this view , and without a specific proviso in the law we are helpless and unprotected . Paragraph D of Section 15 rather frightens me . It says that if a station permits the use of its facilities on a public question which is to be voted upon , then it must allow equal time for the presentation of each different view . I 'm thinking of an issue which has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airport desperately but we have n't been able to decide on a site because half a dozen different sites have been suggested , with no meeting of minds . Supposing we had on the municipal ballot , at our next election , a proposal to construct an airport on what Detroiters call " the Northwest site . " I shudder to think of our vast audiences dwindling away at the endless talk of chimerical airports . As I read this paragraph , we must allow equal time to the advocates of the Willow Run site , to the Wayne County site , to the Canadian site , to the City Airport site , and to the Riverfront site , all of which have been suggested . I think it would be better to allow equal time to those in favor of the proposal and to those opposed . Similarly , I dislike the first paragraph in Section 17 which provides that if there are varying views in opposition to a question of public importance , the opposition may have twice as much time as the original proponents . Is it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suggested measure , by varying their lines of opposition , to ask for and obtain an opportunity of convincing our audience which will be twice as great as that afforded the affirmative side ? Would it not be better to lump the opposition in an allotment of time equal to that of the proponents ? Section 18 deals with news sources . I do not quite understand it . In substance it states that the sources of news must be identified , fore and aft .  | But the context is somewhat clouded because it could be interpreted to mean that each item in a newscast must be identified as to source . On my own station our newscasts are preceded by an announcement reading " we now present the news as compiled from the dispatches of the Associated Press , the United Press , and by the staffs of the Detroit News and of WWJ . " But there is no attempt to identify each item as to source ? although occasionally the newscaster may introduce an item by saying something like " from London comes an Associated Press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this before every item on each newscast . It would become quite annoying and boresome and time-consuming to the degree of restricting news coverage . I hope that Section 18 will not compel us to do any more than is now contained in our introduction . Frankly , I see no need of it . Commentators are another problem . Some of them get pretty big for their breeches . My own opinion is that radio would be better off without some of its highest-rated commentators , but I think that any attempt to regulate their activities by law is dangerous and that such an attempt would constitute an infringement of the constitutional guarantees of free speech . Sensationalism enters into every phase of our national life and we can not hope to keep it out of radio . It so happens that neither my station nor the network with which we are affiliated , NBC , goes in for sensation-seeking commentators . And as our opposition in seeking listeners , a number of them have attracted immense audiences which I would dearly love to annex . But I still do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not think that the answer to the commentator problem lies in attempting to prescribe it by law . Rather I think it lies in helping radio to continue the job it has done in the past quarter-century of slowly but steadily enlarging the understanding and consciousness of our people . Overregulation would hinder rather than help this work . Turning to the section on networks , No. 19 , there is one paragraph which I dislike more than anything else in the bill . It is paragraph 4 , which limits network optional time to not more than two hours in any consecutive three-hour period . It may sound strange to you that a station manager says he does n't like a proviso in the bill which will give him more time to use locally . But I do n't like it because , basically , it is bad for the entire radio structure , and therefore in the long run it will hurt my station . The network is the heart of radio , the core of the entire industry . It is the network system which has contributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which tends to weaken or to destroy the excellence of network service is fundamentally bad for all radio .  | Certainly I 'd love to have that extra time , but after a while , when because of the decline in my network programs my whole audience declines , along with the usefulness of my station to its community , I wo n't be so happy . A network depends primarily on being able to deliver blocks of time on all its stations . And because the network furnishes its stations with the programs which command the largest audiences , it is fitting and proper that the best listening hours , in solid blocks , should be allocated to network programs . At present on my station the network uses 8:00 ? 11:00 p.m. , eastern standard time , which are undoubtedly the top listening hours on week nights . Supposing , as proposed in this bill , the network time started at 8:00 p.m. and ran only until 10:00 p.m. instead of until 11:00 p.m . I would lose one-third of the high-audience shows I now have in the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd probably lose a lot of audience , as I can not hope to duplicate for one hour nightly the fine shows now being delivered by NBC . I can put on a program occasionally which compares favorably with NBC 's best ? and that 's more than 95% of our stations can do ? but I can not hope to do so on a production basis , night after night . I know that many people , advocates of various causes , have complained that not enough good evening hours are available over the top stations in their respective communities because of the fact that the networks take up this time . Please consider , however , that the 60,000,000 radio sets in this country were purchased primarily because the buyers of these sets wanted to be entertained , and not because they wanted to be enlightened , educated , elevated , preached at , or anything else . It 's all right , now and then , to let someone do all these things , but no matter how vital the message may be , you can not hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the listener , UNLESS HE 'S LISTENING . And if you punch any great big holes in his entertainment programs , he just wo n't be there to listen when you attempt to make a better or smarter man out of him . It 's a matter of fine balance . Radio must consist mostly of entertainment in some form or another . If you have enough entertainment , you have lots of listeners . Then you can hand out occasional doses of culture , uplift , education , religion , etc. , and more than do a good job . But if you cut the entertainment and increase the other classifications unduly , you might as well forget radio as a medium for making a better human race , because no one will listen excepting those who deal in the things they would substitute  | for entertainment , and presumably such people do not require elevating influences of any sort . Speaking as a network affiliate , I ask that you do not place this limitation on network operations . I think the status quo is quite satisfactory as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a lot of loose talk about " network domination " and about freeing affiliates from their slave status , but honestly , gentlemen , if our state is that of serfs , we 're quite happy about it . We have our differences within each network , but whatever they are , they 're relatively simple and require no legislation in order to achieve adjustment . My station 's most valuable asset is its NBC affiliation . Therefore I am deeply concerned about anything that hurts NBC . I have one final suggestion : I would like to see included in the law a proviso which would make it impossible for anyone to procure a license if that person has owned a radio station and has sold it . There is a lot of trafficking in licenses and apparently no one is doing anything to stop it . I see nothing wrong in anyone selling a station for a profit . But I see great wrong in permitting such a person to repeat the process . The Detroit News and I personally regard the assignment of a wavelength , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We would n't think of selling our station at a profit , which we could easily do , in the hope of starting another station with the proceeds and still have money left in the bank . Yet that sort of stuff is going on constantly , and people who have disposed of their radio properties at fancy prices pop up shortly afterwards with new stations , which presumably in time will be sold for further gain . I think this trafficking in frequencies should be specifically forbidden by law . There undoubtedly are some worthy exceptions . I can think of one , namely , in the case of a network which requires an originating station in some talent point , such as New York or Hollywood . In order to acquire such a station that network may have to sell another station so as to stay within the number it is permitted to own . But , outside of such legitimate needs , I think a law is required prohibiting this bad practice . In closing I want to state that after carefully studying your proposed bill I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscientious effort to help radio . For this I thank you . If there are any points on which I have expressed criticism or disapproval , I have ventured to do so only because I am certain that you want this from a station operator . I would like to see my suggestions incorporated in the law , but if you should decide that my views are unsound or that they represent an individual or industry view- point rather than a national viewpoint , I am more than ready to honor your considered decisions . All intelligent broadcasters recognize that there must be regulation , else chaos would result , but please give us a law which will make that regulation definite , specific , understandable , and leaving as little as possible to the whimsy of imperfect man . And above all , give us a law .  | AM manager of radio station KRNR at Roseburg , Oregon , and supervising director of station KFLW in Klamath Falls , Oregon . I do not own stock in either radio station , nor any stock in either newspaper to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximately 10,000 . Klamath Falls is about 30,000 . I am here to express certain opinions relative to the proposed legislation affecting the radio broadcasting industry which this committee is considering . The major portion of my comment concerns Section 16 of the proposed legislation which has to do with the " business regulation " of a radio station . During the twelve years that I have been actively engaged in the operation of radio stations , my experience has been largely confined to the low power or local station in the small town . It has been my experience during these years that radio broadcasting as an industry has been steadily and continuously losing what little freedom of operation it once enjoyed through a consistent multiplication of rules , regulations and restrictions flowing from the FCC . Neither the proposed legislation nor past regulation has ever accorded the broadcaster , in specific and unmistakable language , the right and privilege to operate his station under the American system of unrestricted free enterprise . The language of Section 16 of the proposed legislation amending section 326 of the Act , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this Act shall be understood or construed to give the Commission the power to regulate the business of the licensee of any radio  | broadcasting station UNLESS otherwise specifically provided in this Act . " The phrase " unless otherwise specifically provided in the Act " is the stone wall . No sooner does the proposed legislation provide that the Commission shall not regulate the business of a broadcasting station than a catch-all condition is immediately appended and we 're right back where we started . The proposal that the Commission not be allowed to regulate the business of a radio station is nothing more than a constitutional right of free enterprise which has always been guaranteed in this country to all other types of free enterprise . The American system of broadcasting is a medium of mass communication and is a free private enterprise by any comparative standards , yet it suffers business regulation by Commission rules and practices that no other private enterprise has ever suffered since the right of freedom of speech was established . In the very same document ? this proposed legislation ? which specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a radio broadcast station unless otherwise specifically provided in the Act , there appears in Section 8 the following provision : " The Commission shall have authority to make general rules and regulations requiring stations to keep records of such programs , transmission of energy , communications or signals as it may deem desirable ; and to prescribe uniform systems of financial reports which may be required from the licensee of each radio station . " Note that the provision specifically says among other things a " record of programs , and a system of uniform financial reports . " Let me show you the required FCC forms for the submission of these two reports which are requested annually and which are usually mailed to the broadcasters from 30 to 60 days in advance of the deadline for filing with the Commission . Speaking of further business regulation , take the case of the man who is applying for a radio station . In his application he is required to set forth in detail , with exhibits , the character and types of program service he proposes to furnish when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show ( Page 36 , form 301 , as revised April 25th , 1944 ) the TOTAL AVERAGE WEEKLY time to be devoted to such program classifications as Entertainment , Education , Religious , Agricultural , Fraternal , News , etc . He is further required to state the number of hours and percentage of time per month to be devoted to sustaining programs ? those without paid sponsors ? and commercial programs . The applicant is also required to state what percentage of the total monthly time will be used for network programs ( if he contemplates an affiliation ) , both sustaining and commercial .  | This , of course , is only a small part of his application , and very simple to handle , since the elapsed time between the filing of his application and the time of final grant may only be a matter of eight months to two years during which time prices , labor conditions and community problems and development remain absolutely constant to fit the information given in the application . To get to the point in this case ? let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now completed three years of operation . It is time for license renewal . Time to fill out another application and to show again how much time is being devoted to all the types of programs originally set forth in the application , and to show again how much time is devoted to paid programs and how much time to sustaining programs . This is the check-up . This information reveals to the FCC how the broadcaster is maintaining those percentages in program time that he originally said he would , and if he took in a greater percentage of paid programs than he set forth in the original application . And what happens if his percentages have changed with changing conditions in his town ? A check-up is made by the FCC before the license renewal is granted . This , gentlemen , is Business Regulation with a capital B under implied threat of losing a license to broadcast . True , the provisions of the present Act do not specifically state that percentages in types of programs and in sustaining and commercial time can not change , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this connection constitute a serious business regulation through implied threat of losing a license or having it held up pending investigation . Ask any broadcaster his reaction to showing his complete breakdown by hours and percentages of his program structure for his renewal of license application and his annual program report , and let him tell you what he suffers and why . With another example , I 'd like to show how the declaration of the amount of time to be devoted to sustaining programs and commercial programs very neatly devolves into the most vicious type of business regulation . Broadcaster X applies for a radio station . In his application he states that he expects ( eventually ) to operate his station on a 70-30 percentage basis . Remember , this statement is a requirement of the Commission . He eventually expects to have 70 per cent of his time sold and on a commercial basis and the other 30 per cent will be sustaining time ? no income from it . During the first year of operation his progress is comparatively slow ,  | and he has far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's just in the normal building-up process so he gauges his operation carefully ? keeps his expenses as low as he can in order to get into the black as quickly as possible . Two more years of hard work pass and things are looking up . The station has been on the air three years , and the staff has grown to pretty fair size ? operation costs have gone up with station growth . New equipment has been added . The station is building itself up inside as well as outside , and , lo and behold , the station manager finds that he has reached the point of having 70% of his air time sold commercially . This is slightly serious because that was the limit provided for in the original application . And just at this point , what happens ? A new station is granted in his area and goes on the air . Bingo ? competition ! News print loosens up at the local newspaper a bit and more advertising space is available over there . Conditions have changed and prices are sky-high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , competition has set in , conditions have tightened up . Wages have n't dropped a bit and the squeeze is on . If competition forces an advertising rate decrease because the two stations split up the audience , how can he keep his head above water unless he steps over the 70 per cent commercial deadline ? Can he afford to squabble with the Commission about that ? Can he cut down his staff and let the other station beat him out ? He 's right in the middle , and that original REQUIRED regulation making him state his percentage turned out to be a very rough business regulation . Who is to say , and by what right , how much of its time a radio station can sell ? What authority , constituted or otherwise , can assume the responsibility for public taste and preference in radio programs to such a degree as to presume to say what programs are in the public interest and which are not , and how great a percentage of time should be allotted to specific types of programs ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless at the manager 's discretion ? Is there a law that a grocery store must agree to give away a certain percentage of its food in order to open up for business ? The natural law of preference on the part of the public has been the natural law determining the success or failure of private American business enterprise . The manufacturer , the individual merchant , the newspaper ? all survive and thrive or decline and fall on the natural law of public preference . There is no longer the scarcity of frequencies in radio that makes a licensee secure without thought of programming or listeners . Over 100 radio stations in this country are up for sale on the present market , and many frequencies are going begging . Stations in AM are springing up at a tremendous rate since the war-time freeze has been lifted on radio station   applications , and the prospect of over 700 new FM stations is a matter of record at the Commission . Can there be any question that public preference and acceptance will determine which stations will thrive and grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience , will be dropped by the advertisers and subsequently forced either out of business or into new programming fields to hold their own ? All the business regulation that radio needs is open competition in its field , and the radio audience and the advertisers will become the most compelling and exacting regulatory forces that could be devised . That is the basic American principle of free enterprise . I challenge anyone to say that radio has not earned its right to the freedom that other free , private business enterprises enjoy .   SOME four years ago ? in November , 1943 ? I appeared before some of you distinguished gentlemen to urge passage of a new radio law . That was on the occasion of consideration of the so-called WhiteWheeler Bill ( S. 814 ) . That bill died aborning , I believe . I appear before you again today in a similar role . I believe the supreme need of American radio is a new radio law that will clearly and unmistakably establish the essential freedom of radio against even the suspicion ? not to say the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislative vehicle before you , the bill of Senator White , is designed to achieve the end of appropriate regulation of the dynamic radio medium . With some of its provisions I am in hearty accord . But I recognize in it many of the provisions of the White-Wheeler bill , which failed of enactment , I assume , because it failed to find favor in Congress , with the regulatory authority , or with the industry . Being a newspaper publisher and a broadcaster , rather than a lawyer , I first turned to the section-by-section analysis of the White Bill upon its introduction . I found myself in sympathy with much of it . But quite frankly , when I read the bill itself , I discovered provisions which seemed to fall far short of or go beyond the goal sought . From preceding witnesses you have heard about specific objections to provisions of the bill as now written . With much of what has been said I   am in agreement . I differ with certain of my colleagues , however , in respect to a few provisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let me say that I concur in those provisions of the measure which are designed to prohibit the licensing authority from : 1 . Discriminating against station ownership , such as newspaper ownership of stations . 2 . Regulating the business of broadcasters . 3 . Invoking the so-called AVCO procedure of open-bidding in station transfers . There are other provisions in the measure which I feel are highly desirable but which , because of qualifications , seem to me to undo the very ends sought to be accomplished . Considerable stress , I note , has been placed upon the so-called political and controversial issues sections of the White bill , designed to provide equal opportunity and access to the microphone . Unlike some of those who have testified , I feel that stations should be held liable for that which is broadcast over their facilities . The broadcaster , in my judgment , must assume the responsibility of ? and , therefore , have the authority to censor ? libelous , slanderous , or false accusations . There is strong doubt in my mind whether Congress can legislate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such instances . It seems to me the legislative effort to regulate and control political broadcasts and discussions of controversial issues will be the cause of much confusion , controversy and dissatisfaction on the part of the public and the broadcasters . The answer to every problem which arises in the day-to-day operation of radio simply can not be spelled out in a legislative enactment . I respectfully submit that the end which your Committee seeks could be achieved through the device of a simple mandate in the law which , in substance , would require that all broadcasters treat fairly and without prejudice all qualified candidates for public office , and their duly authorized spokesmen , and that they be given substantially equal opportunities on the air . In other words , I would urge the Committee to provide for what might be described as " censorship of accusation " by the station licensee , but not " censorship of argumentation . " In examining the record of these hearings last week , I have noted that there exists considerable confusion as to the recognition of radio on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publisher and a broadcaster . In my two-score years in the newspaper business and nearly a score in radio , I feel I am qualified in some small way to compare the media .   Radio , to me , is an electronic printing press . It is as simple as that . We publish two newspapers in Asheville . We have one broadcasting station , with another coming up ? an FM outlet . We get national and international news for our newspapers from the press associations . We supplement that with local news , gathered by our city staff . We buy syndicated columns and comics and other features . We sell local and national advertising . For our radio station , we get national and international news from the same press associations . We get national program service , including news , from the Columbia Broadcasting System , which , in a measure , is the counterpart of the news association . We buy syndicated features by transcriptions . We have access to local news and programs through departments of our broadcasting station created for those functions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my duties as director of our station . The only difference may be that I am constrained to spend more time on the radio end because it is a more dynamic , a faster-moving medium ? and because we have the competition of four other stations in town ! We publish the only newspapers in our city . Once there was competition . We consolidated because it was economically inadvisable to compete . By joining forces , we were enabled to give our subscribers better newspapers . I 've read a lot in the record about the " limitation " factor in available assignments in radio being responsible for some degree of program and business control . The condition I cite as to radio in Asheville is typical of almost every city in the country . There are more stations than newspapers today . I doubt whether that situation will obtain two or three years from now . There has been lots of testimony about the vast increase in the number of stations . We are told that FM will make possible the licensing , not of a mere 1,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . There has been no testimony , however , about stations which have gone off the air . I recall that in 1927 or 1928 , there were upwards of 100 so-called educational and religious stations on the air . Today , I believe the records will show , there are about two dozens . That 's because they could n't stand the economic gaff . And that means only that they did n't please a large enough segment of the audience to justify their economic existence . Which gets us to the question of program control , which has consumed more space in this record than any other subject . Properly so . American radio has a censor . He is Mr. Average Citizen . He lives within easy range of many stations . He is the master of the situation . With a slight twist of-the knob , he can turn thumbs down on any and every station .   There are some 1,700 standard stations scattered throughout the length and breadth of the land . These stations are owned and operated by American citizens of all political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes . We are Jews and Protestants and Catholics . We are Republicans and New Dealers and Democrats . There may be a Mugwump or two among us . We are isolationists , interventionists , internationalists . We are economic royalists and semi-paupers and all the financial stages between these extremes . If there be among us some who in their programming policies are inclined to give preference to their own religious or economic or political faiths , there are others with opposite preferences to give similar priority to our beliefs . The net result is a fair approximation of the political and economic and religious diversity of the American people . What more can you ask of radio in a free country ? The essential freedom of radio is safer in the hands of these 1,700 broadcasters ? and the legions to come in FM and television ? than in the custody of seven men domiciled in Washington . This is not said to flatter broadcasters or depreciate the capabilities of the gentlemen who compose the Federal Communications Commission . We broadcasters are more representative of the varied social , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States of America . We are necessarily closer to the listeners for whom radio exists ; therefore , more sensitive to the disciplines of listener opinions . There is a grave peril to radio freedom implicit in the very fact that stations must be licensed . When the original Radio Act was written in 1927 , licensed broadcasting was held necessary ? regrettably so ? because of the physical and technical limitations on radio . That was Senator White 's intent when he was a member of the House . He often has inveighed against bureaucratic efforts to control the business and program aspects of radio . The old argument was that if there were a superabundance of wavelengths , Federal licensing would be needless and perhaps an unconstitutional invasion of the domain of free speech . The march of electronic science since 1927 , in a practical way , has achieved that goal of superabundance , for even Chairman Denny testified that he thought the rigors of competition would result in the demise of many , many stations in the months ahead . To me it is no answer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radio spectrum . Nothing is limitless , not even the grains of sand on the beaches . The answer in radio is that economic saturation is being achieved ahead of exhaustion of the physical wavelengths available .   So I make the plea to you gentlemen that if we are to preserve for the American people the maximum broadcasting freedom , the Congress must make certain that the power to license does not become the power to throttle . Every station must have the assurance that as long as it obeys the rules and adheres to the policies defined by Congress , its license will be secure against bureaucratic aggression . In the drafting of new legislation , you gentlemen carry a tremendous responsibility . We hope we have convinced you that radio is what I have heard called " audible journalism . " We hope we have buried the " limitation " hoax , just as you have been convinced over the years that newspapers should not be denied the privilege of station operation . We ask you to see to it that the freedom of broadcasting is imbedded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that law will understand it beyond shadow of doubt .   AM a resident of Butte , Montana . I have been in the radio broadcasting business since 1922 and am still operating the station I started then . I believe in the future of radio broadcasting in the United States and the best proof of that is that it has been my business for twenty-five years and I hope to remain in it for the rest of my life . I am not a lawyer ; I am not an economist ; I have no fancy college degrees ; I just know something about the practical operation of small and medium-size radio stations , serving small and medium-size communities . I operate radio stations in Spokane , Washington ; Portland , Oregon ; Butte , Helena and Bozeman , Montana . Also , I am interested in a station in Ellensberg , Washington , and in a station now under construction in Missoula , Montana . Four of these stations are network affiliates ; three with NBC and one with Columbia . I appreciate this opportunity to appear before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the National Association of Broadcasters since 1929 . I tell you this because I have read with interest the lecture delivered your Committee by Judge Miller , the head of the NAB . As one who has to cope with the day-to-day problems of trying to entertain the public , present the day 's news and allocate time on the air so all shades of opinion may be made available to the public , I hasten to say that I know there is a first amendment to the Constitution and I am in favor of upholding it , as well as all other Constitutional provisions . But , some of us may have forgotten that at the time that first amendment was written there was no great system of mass communication as we know it today .   If every person in the country could have a broadcast station without interfering with anyone else ; if no two or more of those stations were ever hooked together as a network , we would n't have to worry about a thing . There would n't even be a need for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and individuals to broadcast to great masses of our population ? when we have the red or green light of access to air time on a national basis turned on or off by a handful of men at the head of four networks ? when it is within the power of those men to combine their facilities and put only one voice ? one set of ideas or one philosophy of government before the people of these United States to the exclusion of time for any answer ? then we are faced with serious problems which Congress must consider and I , for one , am most happy to see Congress wrestle with it . Mass communication , and in particular radio broadcasting , has made it necessary that Congress spell out the rules by which the dissemination of many ideas , many thoughts , and many different philosophies of government are to be accomplished . It is not enough to say : a licensee is financially qualified ? a frequency is available ? start broadcasting . S. 1333 recognizes this fact and I am happy to see the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't intend to say the bill is perfect ; I do n't think there is any legislation ? proposed or enacted ? that is perfect . As a practical broadcaster , I want to be of whatever help I can in telling you how a few of the sections of this bill will work " as I see them . " First , though , let me say this : anything can be sold by radio ? merchandise or ideas . Radio talks to great masses of people ? people , many of whom do not take the time or trouble to inform themselves in any other way . Some speakers who appear regularly each day or each week become household authorities to many listeners . It is to the interest of the people to know whether it is truth or fiction ? fact or the coloring of fact , that they are hearing . I have just returned from a trip to South America . In one country I learned of a newspaper that had its radio station closed down because the paper had been unfriendly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south of us all stations in a country are frequently hooked up for a simultaneous broadcast of some high government official or for government edited news , and no one is permitted the use of the radio to answer . We do not have the same thing in this country , but I call attention to the fact that when the President of the United States speaks ? be he Republican or Democrat ? his voice is heard on all four chain systems simultaneously , as well as over many non-chain or independent stations .   However , when the opposition answers it is given a single network or frequently only part of one . Now I am in favor of every President talking directly to the people . It is a great thing . It is a service that radio certainly should render the public . I do think though that some plan should be worked out so the public might hear an answer even to the ideas of the President when he talks on a controversial issue . Yet , I do not know of a single case where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't mean an answer over a network of 10 , 20 or 100 stations , with some of the stations delaying the answer by recording and putting it on late at night . I do n't mean an answer in a time bracket opposite Bob Hope or Fibber McGee and Molly or some other top show that has gathered through the years great listener attention . I mean an answer over the same identical stations hooked up for simultaneous broadcast without the competition of top shows to distract the listeners ' attention . That is the only way we can have genuine free speech on the radio ? provide equal facilities and equal time . That , I believe , was the real intent of the first amendment . That is the way to have an informed public opinion ? and that is the way to preserve a democratic republic . I am not talking legalistically , but in my opinion the effect is the same whether free speech is " abridged " by government or " limited " by monopoly or private control . The test is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he is entitled to hear and know . The founding fathers did n't intend to let you talk from the steps of the Capitol and allow me to answer only from the center runway at the airport with the roar of plane motors drowning me out . I can not believe Judge Miller represents many thinking broadcasters on this point . Senator White and the Committee deserve commendation in attempting to solve this problem in S. 1333 . Senator White , in introducing this bill , said : " The purpose of the bill is largely to clarify the meaning and intent of the existing act and to rectify some of the defects which have become obvious during the past twelve years of administration of the law . " The procedural sections can and have been dealt with by lawyers better than I can . It is in connection with the policy sections pertaining to freedom of expression on the radio ? censorship or radio station operation ? that I may be of some help to this Committee . Section 7 With respect to Section 7 of the bill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stations engaged in chain broadcasting : I do n't know whether this is good or bad ? it is something the networks should be  | happy about because they certainly objected to the Commission rules pertaining to network operation several years ago . This section must be considered in connection with Section 19 in which the network rules have been written into law . As a station operator , I am inclined to like this as it tells me definitely what the rules are under which I will have to operate . Regarding paragraph ( a ) ( 4 ) of Section 19 ? I rather like the two-hour option in each three-hour period of time , although some of my broadcast friends have testified otherwise . Such an option arrangement would allow my stations to have news or other local public interest programs more frequently than is now possible . This feature is more important in the sparsely populated areas of the country than in the metropolitan areas . It is , however , not a matter of major concern to me . Beginning with paragraph ( c ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perplexing problem ? monopoly through ownership or control . It is important to point out that monopoly is not being corrected when limitation of ownership is based on mere numbers of stations ; for example , the owner of a 250 watt station is by no stretch of the imagination in the same position as the owner of a 50,000 watt station . Do you gentlemen realize what the coverage of a 50,000 watt clear channel station is ? Do you realize what it is worth in a monetary way ? Actually , one 50,000 watt clear channel station well located may be worth as much as fifty 250 watt stations ! Do you realize that in radio , many factors beside that of the number of stations owned by one licensee must be considered as elements in building monopoly ? Location on the dial ? that is , whether a station is at the lower or upper end of the dial ; the power assigned , which I already have mentioned ; the geographic location , whether a station 's signal is protected to within a five mile , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its transmitter . All of these are factors ? and to a radio broadcaster they are bread-and-butter factors . The approach to these problems through Sections 7 and 19 may not be the only answer . But this much is clear : it is better to try something than it is to sit still and do nothing . I do not have to tell you gentlemen that if we in the industry remain blind we will wake up one day facing an irresistible clamor for government ownership or operation . I do n't want to be around when that day comes ; I know you gentlemen do n't want it to happen and I believe that prudence and wisdom compel some action now to avoid that happening . May I impress one thought upon you ? there may be more monopoly in the ownership of one 50,000 watt clear channel station than in the ownership of twenty 250 watt stations or four or five 5,000 watt stations .   When I first read Section 9 I approved of its obvious intent . Then I read what Chairman Denny of the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read it again . I can not agree with the fears expressed by Chairman Denny regarding this section . It seems to me this section places a responsibility on the Federal Communications Commission to make a fair and just distribution of radio facilities . This responsibility rests with you here in Congress ; as the representatives of the people you have no other alternative than to pass it along to the Commission you have created to do this work . It is a responsibility the Commission will have to accept ? a responsibility to see that pot just the people of the great metropolitan areas of the country receive radio service but that the people of the rural areas receive radio service . Radio surveys show conclusively that the listener wants a radio service for the people of the metropolitan areas designed for their particular needs and broadcast by stations located in their areas ; and similarly a radio service designed for the needs of the people in the rural and smaller communities served by stations located in their areas and constantly alive to their wants and problems . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission 's ability to administer such a paragraph in the law in distinguishing between communities with applications pending and those with no present applications . I should like to call attention to the Commission 's policy in making allocations in the FM band in which they have already designated specific frequencies and specific numbers of frequencies to various communities all over the country . Similar allocations have been made in the television bands . Let me make clear what I am driving at . How is it that the Commission is not fearful of making economic determinations in allocating frequencies in FM and television bands and shies away from making them in the AM band ? The Commission Chairman told you , of course , that the FM and television allocations were technical engineering allocations and that economic factors did not enter into them . If that is so , ask yourselves why metropolitan New York is assigned twenty FM channels and Butte , Montana , two channels ? That pattern is repeated all over the country ? Lewiston , Maine , has two channels while Boston has ten channels ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one channel . Of course , as a practical matter , it is late but certainly not too late for just such a plan to be worked out in the AM band despite the fact that  | present practice appears to be to force all regional and local AM licensees out of the band ? and that means out of business . This may have been in Chairman Denny 's mind when he said , " It is not and should not be part of the Commission 's job in licensing radio stations to consider the effect of the licensing of such station on the economic position of existing stations in the same community , or , conversely , the possible impact of such existing stations on the financial position of the applicant . " I have no fear of competition under a set of equitable rules . I have no fear of any rules so long as they are the same for my competitor as they are for me . The rules in radio have never been the same for all licensees . For example , I can come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a coverage of 100,000 potential listeners in an area within a radius of 25 miles . I make my plans , spend my money for equipment and then for programs , and eventually establish an audience in the area . Then one morning I wake up and find I am working with an entirely different property . Some other station has been put on my frequency and , in place of being protected for 25 miles , the signal from my station is protected only for 15 miles and I have lost a substantial portion of my listening audience . This occurred ? and bear in mind my hypothetical example is happening all the time in radio broadcasting ? because the Commission in issuing construction permits , does not conform to its own standards of engineering practice . The particular channel on which I operate is no longer the same channel , in effect , and my whole status has been completely changed . My investment is the same , but the listeners I have built up through good programming , which incidentally cost me money , have been lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , may well be on a frequency on which no other station in the country is operating and on which the Commission will not even accept applications . I believe this is a good place to refer to Chairman Denny 's testimony before the House Committee on Appropriations , which he affirmed before this Committee ? testimony in which he admitted that many of the stations which the Commission has licensed are going to go broke . That is a significant admission . He uses that admission to prove that the Commission is following competitive practices ? a survival of the fittest . Actually , of course , the Commission has for years taken many economic factors into account in granting licenses . But , most important , its constant chiseling away at engineering standards by revising the radius a station serves is itself an economic determination in the guise of an engineering one . When Judge Miller advocates not giving the Commission power to consider economic factors , and the Commission Chairman says he ca n't   accept them , I say they must not be aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Judge Miller is , of course , new to radio . He knows little of its practical problems . If he had conferred with enough of his members who operate radio stations he would have learned that it is this very policy of granting hundreds of licenses on regional and local frequencies which makes the little fellow in broadcasting smaller and the big fellow bigger ; it places the networks in the position of enforcing better contracts for themselves and poorer contracts for the affiliate . All this makes me wonder for whom in the NAB the Judge appeared ? those who pay the highest dues or those who are the most numerous . A comparison of his statement before you and that of Mr. Trammell of NBC is revealing . I think there is a great deal of significance in Judge Miller 's admission to this committee that it was he who has gotten the " broadcasters " and the Commission to think along parallel lines . Moreover , if the Commission does n't want to accept responsibility for the granting of licenses equitably over the entire country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a station at the time of the renewal of its license . One responsibility goes with the other . The American people are interested in receiving " GOOD RADIO " ; it is up to the Commission , directed by Congress , to see that they get it . This means good radio from an electrical standpoint and from an over-all program standpoint . It means " good radio " in all parts of the country . " Good radio " is the duty of the licensee to the listener ; " good radio " is the responsibility of Congress to the people . This is a responsibility you have imposed upon the Commission . It is the responsibility which goes with judging what is in the " public interest , convenience and necessity . " It is well that Congress should constantly reiterate this duty to the industry and the Commission . Section 14 In introducing Section 14 of the bill , Senator White said : " It is believed that some method short of absolute revocation should be provided for lesser violations and at the same time make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . The Commission may undertake cease-and-desist procedures , carefully spelled out . and subsequent violation of such a cease-and-desist order is cause for revocation . I agree with the purpose of this section simply because it clarified the entire revocation procedure . It gives the Commission an opportunity to actually enforce the law in cases where it might now be reluctant to act   because it hesitates to take away a license . From the licensee 's standpoint it provides a procedure which gives him a second chance when there may have been an unintentional violation of the Act . Section 15 Now we come to Section 15 . The testimony before this Committee makes clear that this is controversial . I agree that it may not be perfect but I most earnestly believe it is a definite improvement over the vague , indefinite and ambiguous language of the present Act . In my 25 years of station operation I have had a great deal of experience with political broadcasting and I can not understand why broadcasters would not prefer definite language , in law , which establishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to the whim or judgment of seven men in Washington , whose opinions may often be colored by their own political convictions or obligations . I am aware of most of the objections that have been made to this section and , as a practical broadcaster , I would like to comment on them . First , the section takes the Commission out of the picture in political broadcasts . For this , licensees should raise their hands in thanksgiving . No longer would a licensee be hauled before the Commission to explain why he did not sell time to someone who they thought should have time . A licensee would have to look only to the law . No longer would a licensee receive telegrams or personal calls from the Commission for copies of political speeches . Subsection ( a ) provides a definite formula for equitable distribution of time in election campaigns . From a public interest standpoint , it is a distinct improvement over the present situation where a licensee can , if he desires , play politics himself for his friends and against his enemies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights and exactly equal opportunities . Subsection ( b ) broadens equal opportunities to make clear that all parties are treated equally . I definitely disagree with Chairman Denny , for example , who told you that a third party " trying to get on the ballot " would have no rights . I do n't know what he means . This section covers only political campaigns ; if the third party is not on the ballot , or if some of its candidates are not on the ballot , of course , it would n't want to buy time . But if it is trying to get organized or get on the ballot , it has rights under Section 17 never before granted by radio to such minority groups . This Section 15 should not be considered in a vacuum ; it should he read in connection with Section 17 dealing with discussion of public controversial   questions . But if the third party is organized ? and I certainly do not interpret the words " regularly organized " to mean that only the Republican and Democratic parties are regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intend the language to apply only to the two parties ? that third party has equal rights and equal opportunities with all others and so do its candidates . Objections have been raised to subsection ( c ) . Some witnesses and some groups who appear to talk before they think contend that this subsection invades free speech because it limits those who may use the radio in political campaigns . Over the years I am getting a little fed up with this mantle of free speech that is thrown around everything whenever it is proposed that some action be taken in the public interest . The only invasions of free speech I have experienced have been the limitations imposed by those who own or control the media of mass communications . I ca n't help wondering about the sudden concern expressed by Federal officials about limitations of free speech . One criticism of this subsection is that every group or individual who wants to be heard will be denied access to the air . What rights do all these people have now under the present law ? Can everyone get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate a station , the night before an election everything on the air is politics from 6 p.m. to midnight . Practically every announcement for a week before election is a political announcement . It is physically impossible to make time available to everyone who wants to be heard ; there is n't that much time on the air under the present system . How can there be a fair balance of time for or against a particular candidate or a party under this present system ? This bill would help meet that situation by making mandatory a fair , impartial balance of time . As for the legalistic objection that nonpolitical groups such as women 's voters , unions , social or fraternal organizations who may want to support or oppose a candidate or a party would not get time , I say , baloney ! They would have more rights than they now have . Now , they are subject to the whim of the licensee . Under the bill , they have rights ? the rights granted the candidate or the party . What candidate or party is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him or their candidates ? Are you Senators going to refuse to allow a spokesman for a labor union or a league of women 's voters to speak in your behalf ? Is your opponent or his party going to deny them time to speak against you ? These are the practical , common-sense facts and the bill recognizes them . It has been suggested that if a candidate is not on the ballot , he or his supporters can not get radio time . I do not agree . All the bill requires is that any candidate be legally qualified . Even a write-in candidate is legally   qualified . And since he is , he has the same rights under Section 315 as has every candidate . Finally Chairman Denny made two other objections . One was that he doubted that a speaker could endorse all the candidates without securing the permission of all the candidates individually . I believe the section could n't be stretched to mean that ? even by some of the Commission 's best legal minds . It must be obvious if the speaker is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he wants about whom he wants without let or hindrance from anyone , including the licensee . His second objection was that commentators would be prevented from discussing the campaign , the candidates or the issues . I think we should give this point serious consideration . I believe that the content of this entire section is fairness and equality . And that is the reason I am so strongly in favor of it . Let us be fair to the commentator ? but let us also be fair to the listener and , most of all , to those whom he speaks against . Therefore , I suggest that you amend the section by exempting recognized , regular commentators from its provisions , but add a proviso that such commentator must make his time available to the candidate or party he opposes , so that his contention can be fairly answered to his own audience . The proposed " cooling-off period " of 24 hours is good . It is the Canadian system . It will give time for the public mind to digest the mass of material heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found out . Section 16 Section 16 which alters Section 326 of the present Act is a definite improvement . I compliment Senator White on what he said in introducing this section . It is the best guarantee of proper governmental supervision of an uncensored and independent radio we can have . These are the words to which I refer : " The proposed language of this section does not take away the Commission 's authority to make a finding whether or not a licensee has operated in the public interest ; it is , in fact , affirmed . But it also makes clear that the Commission does not have the authority to tell a licensee , directly or indirectly , what he can broadcast or can not broadcast , or how he should run his day-by-day business . " In other words if a broadcaster does an over-all " good job " of broadcasting he need have no fear that his license will not be renewed . As I view this language the Commission has no authority to single out any one particular program and go after a licensee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have no power to say : take this off the air ? put that on the air .   I think I should add here that I do not like government regulation any more than anyone else . In fact , I like it less . I subscribe to the philosophy expressed by Jefferson when he said , " That nation is best governed which is least governed . " In radio we have a practical situation which I prefer to face in a practical common-sense way . The people , acting through its government , has granted me a license . Without that license I can not be in business ; with it I have a valuable enterprise . Just ask some of these broadcasters for what they are being paid a quarter of a million , or half a million or a million or more dollars . Is it for the buildings and the transmitters , or even for the " goodwill , " or is it really the license ? Oh , I know that licenses are not supposed to be sold , but you gentlemen are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people would like to have you there . Some licenses are worth money ? a lot of money ? and I believe that certain conditions attach to the grant of that license . I most emphatically do not agree with Judge Miller when he asserts that radio broadcasting should be as free of government control as are newspapers . The Judge is living in a make-believe world he has created and he wants you to follow him there , while the industry remains here in this hard-fisted , practical world , running this important media of mass communications as it will . I believe that , if Congress were to modify this section as Judge Miller suggests , just as surely as that is done we will end up with government ownership , or at least control . The excesses of the few will condemn all of us . Why , we are suffering from that today . It is only a few broadcasters that make trouble for the many ; those few whose eyes are always first on the dollar and second on public service . If those excesses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty , what do you suppose is going to happen when all the bars are down ? I say that will bring the end of what is so fondly advertised now as the American system of radio . In my opinion , you have gone a long way to remove broadcasters from the shackles of bureaucracy by spelling out the limits of the Commission 's power . No longer will a broadcaster in fear and trembling be told by some minor employee that he doubts that a particular program is proper ; no longer will he be asked pointed questions which convince him he should drop a particular program . Let the Commission do the job as it is spelled out ? a determination whether the licensee has done a job in the public interest or not ? and if not , why not in specific detail . And , the " why not " will have to be proved in court . Section 17 In Section 17 the bill endeavors to insure a balance in the discussion of political and public questions outside of a political campaign . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that public discussion outside of political campaigns has been handled at all well . This is particularly true of discussion on a national basis . It appears to me that an additional paragraph is needed analogous to the one in Section 15 assuring an answer over an " identical " group of stations for simultaneous broadcast or recorded re-broadcast . The paragraph pertaining to identifying speakers so the listener knows whose axe is being ground is only fair to the listener and will work no hardship on either speaker or stations . Frankly I have never sold time for public discussion outside of a political campaign . I have felt this is a service a licensee owed its listeners , and I know of no way to balance time between those with money and those without funds . This section provides for the sale of such time but also allows for it to be given , which I will probably continue to do . Concerning the liability of the station for libel under this section , it seems to me that the same waiver of liability carried in Section 315 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I agree that a Federal waiver may have little effect on state libel laws but such a provision may eventually result in a series of decisions clarifying the law . In Montana a law was enacted in 1939 pertaining to " radio libel . " This law makes the speaker responsible for the libel and relieves the station of liability for statements over which it has no control . It may be that the broadcasters of other states will get busy and have similar laws passed . Section 18 This is another section over which there is disagreement . It merely requires that broadcasters let the public know whether they are broadcasting factual information , someone 's ideas or something entirely fictitious . I do n't see how anyone who wants to be honest with the public could ever object to this . Of course , there are many who want to hoodwink the public , who do n't like it . Do you remember the Orson Welles mythical broadcast of an invasion from Mars ? If you do , you will realize how unsuspecting ? how believing radio listeners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bench , came in contact with few people , read very little and listened several hours a day to your radio , as many people do , you would soon come to accept as gospel truths the things you hear from this or that particular speaker . You would feel that if it was n't the truth " they could n't broadcast it . " I believe it is an excellent idea to honestly label for the listener exactly what he is getting over his loud-speaker . This is the only way a listener   may intelligently evaluate what he hears . My judgment is that the requirement for this identification is neither onerous nor burdensome , nor will it impede a program . I assume that all that is required is a simple announcement that the news is assembled from the reports of the press services , or the special correspondents of the station . I agree that it will make it difficult for a commentator to shout " flash , Tokyo , " or London , or the White House , when , in fact , the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After all ? it is the listener who is the sovereign in these United States ? it is he who rules ? he must be the best-informed citizen in the world to intelligently cope with the problems in today 's world . I discussed Section 19 which governs network and stations relations and limitation of station ownership when I discussed Section 7 . Section 20 is a redraft of existing provisions in the law prohibiting profane and indecent language but adds a prohibition against a person knowingly broadcasting false accusations or charges against any person . Few people know the great difficulty anyone has today in securing redress through the courts against those who make false accusations on the radio . It has been suggested that this prohibition will tend to prevent free speech over the air . I disagree . I do not believe that the radio should be a refuge for malicious gossip which may permanently damage a person 's reputation . I do not believe that the radio should be used to suggest that a man and wife are getting a divorce , for example , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an addition that has long been needed and one to which no fair-minded person can object . Freedom of speech does not grant a license to slander . Section 25 I again wish to compliment the author of this bill for including Section 25 . This section prohibits discrimination between applicants because of race , religion , political affiliation , lawful occupation or business association . It would prevent the Commission exercising its own judgment about an applicant merely because he may have been or is in some particular kind of business . It fills a long-needed want in further freeing radio from unnecessary and unwise shackles . It is the last section of the bill and well illustrates the clear thinking and desire to better serve all of the public that has gone into the drafting of this measure .   I SHOULD like to first stress the point that censoring of radio programs is a threat to the freedom of speech of this country . This point , I think , will be contested by no one , least of all the Federal Communications Commission and its members . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social theories by operators of radio stations is as much a threat to that freedom as censorship by the Federal Communications Commission . As I understand this bill , it simply ? in the case of political censorship ? lays down a policy that all sides to all political questions should be heard equally . Unless my years as a Washington reporter went to waste I think I can do a pretty good job of analyzing bills that are before Congressional committees . I feel this is a necessary and just regulation . I can cite several cases where such a regulation would be of great use . Particularly so in the case of smaller stations . I know of one case ? which I can not discuss except if the names are deleted ? where a local politician received a grant for a radio station in up-state New York and proceeded to blithely ignore his opponents ' pleas for time . His answer to all requests for time were simply that there was none available on the day sought . When he finally yielded he gave time which gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposed law should , if anything , be strengthened . It should assure each political candidate equal time on the   air , with the provision that failure by a station operator or of a network to grant such time be considered grounds for revocation of license . I also feel that news commentators should be forced , during election campaigns , to yield as much time to rebuttal as they may take themselves during the candidacy of a particular man or party . There is another provision of this bill which I think merits the approval and perhaps even the acclaim of all those interested in the radio industry . I speak of that portion of the bill which divides the FCC 's activities into two separate portions . One of these is to be specifically limited to broadcasting problems , the other limited to communications . With that in mind I should like to propose some simple additions to the bill which would better effectuate a program of freedom of speech and press and more adequately meet the nation 's needs in the field of radio and communications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put under communications instead of broadcast . As a public carrier , censorship would be impossible and all newspapers would have equal access to the benefits of the modern developments . Now these improvements are available only to the larger , wealthier ones . Secondly , I believe that a specific provision barring the limitation on the use of any one frequency for one station should be included to do away with the highly unfair clear-channel situation which makes it impossible for many parts of the country to have radio service of a local character . Thirdly , I suggest that the bill specifically order the FCC to increase the band spread from 540 kc. to 1650 kc. , with the provision that only stations of 250 or less watts in power may be constructed on these frequencies . This is a very short presentation . I hope your questioning will bring out more detailed proposals , which I hope you will consider . Generally , I favor this bill and all of its provisions . I feel most broadcasters would agree if they saw a complete picture of the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @   I AM the president and a substantial stockholder of WGR Broadcasting Corporation , the licensee of Station WGR in Buffalo , New York . I have been engaged in radio broadcasting since 1922 , and was associated with a station in Buffalo , New York , when it became one of the original sixteen stations comprising the Columbia network and have , without interruption , been a Columbia affiliate since its first day of operation . From 1928 to 1946 I was the General Manager of stations WKBW and WGR in Buffalo , New York . During the many years of my activity in radio broadcasting , I have served at various times as a member of the Board of Directors of the National Association of Broadcasters , various industry committees , and as a member of and chairman of the Columbia Affiliates Advisory Board . Columbia Affiliates Advisory Board This Board was organized in the early part of 1943 and is composed of representatives of the independently owned radio stations affiliated with the Columbia network . The members of the Board are elected by the independently owned affiliated stations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or four times a year separately and with representatives of the Columbia network to discuss mutual problems of affiliated stations and the network .   I have been a member of the Board since its inception , and have been Chairman of the Board since 1945 . Based upon my experience and association with station managers and others throughout the radio industry , I believe that my testimony herein is representative of the views of a substantial proportion of broadcast operators . However , it should be pointed out that this testimony represents my own views only , and I do not purport to speak for any other individual or group . Operation under the Network Rules of the FCC In 1943 , following the decision of the United States Supreme Court , the network rules were put into effect and since that time have been incorporated in substance in the contracts between the Columbia network and affiliated stations . At the present time , the relations between networks and affiliated stations , I am advised , conform to the FCC network rules . // The FCC network rules , insofar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are Sections 3.101 , 3.102 , 3.103 , 3.104 , 3.105 and 3.108 . These correspond roughly with the subparagraphs of the proposed new Section 333 ( a ) of the Communications Act as set forth in Section 19 of S.1333 . For the convenience of the Committee , the relevant provisions of the FCC rules and of S.1333 are set out fully in parallel columns . figure   // would expand this to three years . While I believe that S. 1333 is a step in the right direction , it does not by any manner of means go far enough . I believe that there should be no limitation , either in the statute or in the rules of the Commission or otherwise , which places an arbitrary limit on the term of the contracts between networks and stations . It is my belief that the very great majority of station managers agree . At the meeting of the Columbia Affiliates Advisory Board held January 23-24 , 1947 , the following resolution was unanimously adopted by the members of the Board : " RESOLVED that the members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio stations in the United States , having found that Section 3.103 of the Rules and Regulations of the Federal Communications Commission limiting the term of affiliation for standard broadcast stations to a period of no longer than two years , has created unnecessary uncertainties in station operation , including unnecessary uncertainties in the assumption of capital commitments for improvement of stations , and has impaired the efficient conduct of stations by restricting them to a transient contract basis , with frequent renegotiations of affiliation agreement which drain energies better devoted to broadcasting service , all without demonstrable compensation advantages to the public , hereby request the Federal Communications Commission to rescind this provision of its rules and regulations and permit stations to agree to such periods of affiliation as they may negotiate freely . " This resolution was transmitted to the Federal Communications Commission with the request for the rescinding of its Rule 3.103 , and that request was denied by the Commission on April 7 , 1947 . I urge that the Congress take appropriate steps to remove any governmental limitation upon the term of contracts between networks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely with networks in this respect . Option Time The network rules allow options to be given for three hours in each of four designated time periods of the day as set forth in Rule 3.104 above . Actually , the time period between 11:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. is not practicable for net- work broadcasting and the contracts between stations and the Columbia network do not even provide for option time in this segment of the day . At the present time the contract between Station WGR and the Columbia network provides that the following hours on weekdays shall be subject to network option : 9:45 a.m. to 12:45 p.m. 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m . The most important time , from the standpoint of listeners , is , of course , the evening hours , and during the evening , the three hours between 7:00 and 10:00 are subject to option . While time after 10:00 p.m. has been sold to network commercial advertisers on the basis of voluntary acceptance by stations , the three hours between 7:00 p.m. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under the provisions of S. 1333 , this three-hour core would necessarily be reduced to two hours . I am not aware of any substantial desire by stations generally for a reduction in the number of option hours . The change proposed by S. 1333 would , in my opinion , make more difficult the sale of network commercial programs , and would be contrary to the interests of the great majority of station affiliates . Conclusion In general , it is my belief , and always has been my belief , that the relations between a network and stations should not be controlled by special governmental rules , either rules of the Commission or rules spelled out in a statute . The success of affiliated stations depends in large measure upon the success of the network as a whole ? the network being composed of independentlyowned affiliated stations and the central network organization , engaged in a cooperative enterprise . It is my belief that it is not humanly possible to devise rules in advance which represent the best practice under all future conditions . Rather , these conditions can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ networks . For example , it is not possible to foretell at this time the problems which will be encountered in connection with fullwale operation in FM and television . Rules which might be workable when applied to standard broadcast stations and networks might well prove insurmountable obstacles in the development of FM and television networks .   As a station operator with long experience in the field , I do not desire to have my business operations circumscribed by governmental rules . In my dealings with the network , I prefer to rely upon individual free negotiation , rather than conform to general rules which necessarily hinder the fullest development of a worthwhile broadcasting service . It is my belief that most station managers share my views .   WE are , of course , vitally and directly interested in the Communications Act and in any plans to amend it . I therefore take this opportunity , with a great deal of interest , to appear before this Committee to discuss S. 1333 , which was introduced in the Senate by the Honorable Wallace White on May 23 , 1947 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defects or inadequacies which may exist in the present law and to improve it wherever possible . I am certain that Senator White , in drafting the bill , had that uppermost in his mind . It seems to me , however , that we must carefully consider the practical effect of certain of the changes which introduce additional restrictions on the broadcasting industry which are undesirable particularly at a time like this . I do not have in mind the economic conditions confronting broadcasters at this time because I realize that , while extremely important to the individual licensees of broadcasting stations , the economic problems of the industry are only a part of the picture from the standpoint of over-all legislative policy . What I am referring to is the fact that now there are more broadcasting stations in operation in this country than ever before , with the certainty that in the near future this number will be greatly increased . That increase in number has a very important bearing , I think , on the whole philosophy underlying the regulation of radio broadcasting . PIease do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I am appearing as a practical broadcaster , one who has spent 25 years in the business , and who grew up with the industry ; and I intend to deal with the practical effect of the   proposed changes rather than the legal or technical aspects . One thing we should all bear in mind in the drafting and discussion of this legislation is that the broadcasting industry has developed certain practices and policies during the 25-year period of its existence . Those practices and policies should be given due weight , not as standards to be incorporated in a statute , but as substantial assurance that the industry will continue to conduct itself in accordance with those policies without being required by statute to do so . I realize that very elaborate and involved arguments can be made and have been made on both sides of the legal question : To what extent does the First Amendment to the Constitution apply to broadcast licensees ? In addition , I realize that if the First Amendment does apply to broadcasters with the same force and effect as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative body created by it has the power lawfully to adopt regulations affecting anything more than the technical aspects o#-the operations of radio stations , and that any restriction on the dissemination of information or intelligence constituting censorship would be unconstitutional . It is my view that whatever the result of those legal arguments , the Congress should not , as a matter of policy , establish detailed rules governing the business conduct of licensees or the programs broadcast by them . There is no reason which I can see , particularly in view of the rapid growth in the number of broadcasting stations in operation , and soon to go into operation ? and especially in the light of the possibilities in the field of frequency modulation and television ? why the Congress should place any additional restrictions on broadcast licensees , which already go far beyond those which are applicable to publishers of newspapers or magazines and other media of expression . The newspapers and the radio stations in each community discharge essentially the same functions in many ways . They are in direct competition for the attention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to me , therefore , that insofar as it is possible they should be equally free in their business operations and in their programming . Freedom of programming involves freedom to obtain programs from various sources as well as freedom with respect to the actual content of the programs themselves . With respect to freedom of speech , there is a difference of degree only between censorship which entails combing over every word that is broadcast and censorship which consists of telling a broadcaster that he may obtain program material from certain persons only , or that he may not obtain program materials from others . I doubt that Congress would seriously consider passing a law which would define the sources from which a newspaper might obtain material for publication any more than it would pass  | a law under which censorship in detail of the material published would be practiced . Assuming that there may still be some important distinctions between newspaper publishing and broadcasting , my view is that our common goal should be the maximum possible equality of opportunity to serve the public in both these media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise , and we must raise , our sights over those of 1927 and 1934 in considering this legislation . In 1927 there were only 681 radio stations in operation in the continental United States . By 1934 , this number had decreased to 593 radio stations . Now , however , in 1947 we have 1751 AM stations and 854 FM stations , with 678 AM and 192 FM applications pending , and the probability is that within a few years there will be as many as 5000 AM and FM stations on the air in this country . Therefore , the scarcity-of-wavelengths doctrine which underlay the original radio legislation of the United States has , through technical advances , lost much , if not all , of its validity . In 1927 there were 2280 daily newspapers in the United States but today there are only 1720 . These figures give a very important indication of the relative freedom a man has in this country , as a practical matter , to engage in the business of disseminating information to the public in the newspaper field and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody who wants to start a daily newspaper may do so . Apparently , there are some important practical reasons why no more than 1720 publishers see fit to do so . Right now ? today ? there are more broadcasting stations in operation in this country than there are daily newspapers , and there soon will be twice as many broadcasting stations as there are daily newspapers . In the light of these figures , the need for special controls over the business practices and the program policies of broadcasters is obviously much less than it used to be . Even proponents of the scarcity theory would have to agree , it seems to me , that if the opportunity to engage in broadcasting were unlimited , there should be no restrictions whatever applicable to broadcast licensees beyond those which apply to newspaper publishers . Therefore , I feel our whole approach at this time should be not to introduce further restrictions on broadcasters but actually to re-examine the restrictions which are already on the books to determine which of them are still necessary . Some of the suggestions I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deletion of some of the provisions of S. 1333 , but also the change of certain provisions of the Communications Act . I shall take up the various sectiotis on which I have comments in the order in which they appear in the hill and in the Act .   Section 2 of S. 1333 would remove from the definition of " broadcasting " in Section 3(o) the phrase " or by the intermediary of relay stations " and it would , by the transposition of the word " directly , " limit " broadcasting " to the dissemination of radio communications intended to be received directly by the public . Current broadcast operations involve from time to time the use of relay stations . Relay stations are broadcasting stations which are used to transmit broadcast material not intended for reception directly by the public but as a stage or stages in the broadcasting of material intended for ultimate reception by the public . Such relay stations may be used between the originating point of the program and the main transmitter , as well as between the main transmitter and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely used in frequency modulation and television . In the first place , no reason is apparent for the exclusion from " broadcasting " of a transmission or operation which would be broadcasting but for the fact that it involves the use of one or more relay stations . The whole basis for Title III of the Communications Act is that a broadcaster is not a common carrier and therefore Section 3(o) should not be amended as provided in Section 2 of S. 1333 . In the second place , another interpretation of the proposed amendment might be that it automatically and completely effected a transfer of the operation of relay stations in every case from the category of radio broadcasting to the common-carrier field as those terms are distinguished in Section 3 ( h ) of the Act . I believe the status of relay stations should be clarified and that it should be specifically stated in 3(h) that the operation of a relay station may be classified as broadcasting or as the operation of a common carrier depending upon the use to which the relay station is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of Section 3(h) of the Act the following language : " except that relay stations may be licensed either as common carriers or as broadcasting stations depending upon the use to which they are to be put . " Section 2 of the bill would also amend Section 3(p) of the Act to define " network broadcasting " or " chain broadcasting " as the simultaneous or delayed broadcasting of identical programs by two or more stations however connected . Under this definition a licensee having a standard-band station and an FM station in the same market broadcasting the same program would be a network . It is recommended that the last two lines of this section of the bill be changed to read : " means the simultaneous or delayed broadcasting of identical P1417 programs by two or more stations in the same broadcast band however connected . " Sections 4 and 5 of the bill , insofar as they make mandatory the creation of two separate divisions ? a common carrier division and a broadcast division ? are undesirable . It seems to me that it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to create separate divisions in accordance with their own judgment of the most efficient way in which to operate , as they are now free to do under the Act . Under Section 5(c) of the bill , the Chairman 's duties are defined so as to exclude his participation in many of the activities of each of the two divisions . It is provided that he may serve in one of the divisions in the case of a vacancy or the absence or inability of a commissioner to serve . This would make him , it seems to me , a mere administrative officer or substitute commissioner . I do not think this is an efficient organization plan for the Commission and , in particular , I can not imagine the present active and capable Chairman being relegated to such a supervisory and administrative job . I recommend , therefore , that Sections 4 and 5 of the bill not be enacted . Section 6 would amend Section 4(k) of the Act to make more clear and definite what is to be contained in the annual reports to Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4(k) is the same as the corresponding language of present Section 4(k) , namely , that such reports shall contain " such information and data collected by the Commission as may be considered of value in the determination of questions connected with the regulation of interstate and foreign wire and radio communication and radio transmission of energy . " I think it would be desirable to clarify this language at this time by having it read as follows : " Such report shall contain ? ( 1 ) Such of the information and data collected by the Commission under Section 303(j) as may be considered of value in the determination of questions connected with the regulation of interstate and foreign wire and radio communication and radio transmission of energy . " Section 8 would amend Section 303(j) , which is the section giving the Commission power to require the keeping and production of data and reports . At the present time the Commission requires financial reports to be kept and filed by licensees without any express authority to do so in the Act . The new subsection would clearly authorize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 , in amending subsection ( j ) of Section 303 , should expressly negative any right on the part of the Commission to require the filing of financial reports by licensees except in connection with applications for instruments of authorization . Otherwise , there might  | he some base for the Commission to move toward rate regulation in broadcasting , which , of course , would be contrary to the whole basis for the distinction between Title II and Title III of the Act . If an applicant has been found financially responsible and a license has been granted to him , I see no reason for requiring him to file financial reports if the legislative intent is not ultimately to regulate rates . This is a respect in which I believe improvement should be made at this time . I recommend that Section 8 be revised so as to amend Section 303(j) to read as follows : " Have authority to make general rules and regulations requiring stations to keep such records of programs , transmissions , and energy , communications , or signals , as are necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in accordance with the terms of the license , but the Commission shall not be authorized to prescribe uniform systems of financial reports except in connection with applications for instruments of authorization . All such records so filed shall be kept confidential by the Commission except that they shall be available , upon request , for the information of any committee of the Congress , or for use upon order of the Commission , in any proceeding before the Commission . " Section 9 of the bill would amend Section 307 ( b ) of the Act , which deals with the distribution by the Commission of licenses fairly and equitably among the several States and communities . As modified , the phrase " when and insofar as there is a demand for the same " would be eliminated and the following phrase would be added at the end of the subsection : " Giving effect in each such instance to the needs and requirements thereof . " I believe that this revision of 307 ( b ) would seem to put the Commission in the position of passing on business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applicants . This incorporates an added element of regulation which I believe is undesirable . I believe that the distribution of facilities should he among actual applicants therefore , and that no application should be denied on the ground that existing licensees would be subject to greater competition or on the ground that somebody else might apply for such facility at some later time in the same or some other community . The amendment proposed in Section 309(b) by Section 12 of the bill includes among those persons who are parties in interest those who would be adversely affected economically as well as those who would be affected by electrical interference . It is my opinion that to introduce this element of economic status and competition , particularly when coupled with the proposed change in Section 307(b) on which I have just commented , might result in the Commission 's further encroachment on business operations of   licensees contrary to the general basis for the bill as expressed in Section 16 amending Section 326 . I would like to point out that Sections 311 and 313 of the Communications Act put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the anti-trust laws . If a book publisher , for example , is found guilty of a violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act or the Sherman Act , his liability is limited to injunction , fine , or possible imprisonment . There is no provision for taking his book publishing business away . As I see it , that is the effect of Sections 311 and 313 . A licensee might be put out of business following a violation of the law , however minor the infraction might be . This is a matter which I think should be considered by Congress in amending the Communications Act , with a view to putting broadcasters on the same footing as other businesses in this respect . Section 15 of the bill would substantially amend Section 315 of the Act , which , in general terms , requires that a licensee who permits any person who is a legally qualified candidate for public office to use his broadcasting station shall afford equal opportunity to all other such candidates for that office . This is a subject with many ramifications . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of equal treatment and , in my opinion , it is unwise to attempt to spell out in detail the exact treatment which shall be accorded in various instances . It seems to me that a licensee intent on unfair treatment can more readily find a loophole in a detailed and specific provision , that can not possibly anticipate all the situations that may arise , than a provision which is general and all-inclusive in its terms . A highly commendable degree of impartiality in the treatment of political candidates has been maintained by broadcasters under the present Act , and I see no reason for making the section complex in endeavoring to anticipate every type of situation which might arise in a campaign . I do think , however , that it would be desirable to incorporate subsection ( f ) , as set forth in Section 15 of the bill , in Section 315 of the Act , so that the present provision ? that neither the licensee nor the Commission shall have power of censorship over the material broadcast under this section ? is retained and so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liable for any libel , slander , invasion of right of privacy , or any similar liability for any statement made in any such broadcast , except with respect to statements made by the licensee or by persons under his control . My only reservation is that I think that instead of referring to " persons under his control , " it would be preferable to use the phrase " his agents or employees . " Section 16 of the bill amends Section 326 by amplifying it , but in so doing omits a phrase which I consider all-important . The present 326 states   tat no regulation shall be promulgated by the Commission which " shall interfere with the right of free speech by means of radio communication . " t may be argued that the language in proposed Section 326(b) is intended be the equivalent of the present reference to the right of free speech . Howver , I strongly recommend that such an important expression be allowed to emain in the section . The failure to continue to use it might well be misonstrued . Section 17 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Communications Act . The first , Section 330 , deals with discussions of public or olitical questions other than those by political candidates which are covered y Section 315 . Section 330 would provide for equal opportunities for the expression f different viewpoints on political or public questions , with detailed proision for the time to be allowed for different views . Under Section 330 , o take a hypothetical case , any time a licensee allowed an individual or Troup to express an opinion on a public question on a half-hour program , he would be required to permit those holding different views to use the station 's acilities but not for more than a total of one hour . Now it is entirely possible hat during the one hour devoted to the broadcast of views different from hose expressed on the original half-hour program , new issues might be ? aised . In that event , Section 330 would seem to require the licensee to dlow the holders of other opinions on such matters to use the station to express themselves , and those persons would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These additional persons might or might not nclude the individual or group which made the original broadcast . In some cases they would be clearly entitled to reply . Actually the presentation tf new and different views might involve only a fractional part of the entire broadcast time used , and it seems to me unrealistic to have a limit fixed , which is related to the over-all length of the program . In my opinion , it is tot possible to legislate fair treatment of controversial issues , and this is as good an example of that as the proposed new broadcast section ( 315 ) . The industry has set an outstanding record of fairness in its allocation of time for the presentation of all sides of controversial questions without being required to do so by statute otherwise than by the test of public interest . In the Eight of its record , I see no practical reason for incorporating this new section in the Act . As a matter of fact , the adoption of such a section might defeat its own purpose , because obviously one simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in the section would be to schedule fewer programs raising controversial public questions . Section 331 sets forth in great detail the procedures which would have to be followed by the broadcast licensee in connection with each use of his  | station for the discussion of any public or political questions under Section 315 or 330 . The industry has been following in practice substantially the procedures in the case of political broadcasts which are set forth in Section 331 , and if you decide that there is to be the counterpart of this Section 331 in the Act , I most strongly recommend that it be limited in its operation to political broadcasts under Section 315 and that all reference to other public or controversial questions be eliminated from Section 331 . Section 18 of the bill would add Section 332 to the Act , which prescribes the manner in which the source of news items and the source and " responsibility " for editorial and interpretative comment are to be identified . The first two sentences state that : " All news items or the discussion of current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to source , and all editorial or interpretative comment , if any , concerning such items or events , shall be identified as such and as to source and responsibility . It shall be the duty of the licensee of any radio broadcast station used for such purpose to cause an appropriate announcement to be made both at the beginning and at the end of any such broadcast in sufficient detail to inform the audience concerning the origin of the material being broadcast and whose editorial and other comment , if any , is being expressed . " To begin with , the dividing line between discussion of current events and editorial or interpretative comment is difficult if not impossible to place . Assuming that a program consists of current events alone , the various items may have come from many sources , and the identification of all of the sources would be annoying to the listeners , bad as a matter of program policy , and would not reach the goal of fairness which is undoubtedly the end to which the section is directed . Imagine the stiffness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program which complied with the provisions of Section 332 . It would sound more like a treasurer 's report or a manufacturer 's bill of materials . I firmly believe that the overall result would be confusing to the public , and that it would drive listeners away from the radio and at the same time accomplish no good whatever . As a matter of fact , good broadcasting practice in the preparation of news material gives the source of a report where the source is significant . If it were required that the sources of all items are to be given , the specification of the important and significant sources would be completely submerged in the welter of source identifications included in the program . As a listener , as well as a broadcaster , I think it would be one of the worst possible   developments that could occur , and I am heartily opposed to the imposition of such detailed specifications with respect to the composition and editing of broadcast material , particularly material consisting of news . With respect to editorial or interpretative comment , in addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be identified as comment and the " responsibility " for the comment would have to be announced . Just what " responsibility " involves is a nice question in itself . I think that our news broadcasts and our commentary programs would be hopelessly bogged down if this procedure had to be followed . I do n't believe that fairness and morality in the handling of news and information can be legislated . It is my belief that as a matter of practice , a licensee who is not fair in his presentation of news and news comment will soon be detected by his listening audience , recognized for what he is , and his statements will be properly discounted . Section 19 of the bill would incorporate in the Act , as Section 333 , counterparts of all of the network regulations which now are in the FCC rules as Section 3.101 to 3.108 . ( Sections 3.231 to 3.238 in the FM field , and Sections 3.631 to 3.638 in the television field . ) The regulations were adopted by the Commission in 1941 , following the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network affiliation . It seems to me that conditions have changed sufficiently since 1941 , particularly due to the growth in the number of stations in operation , so that no additional regulations are necessary . The regulations are referred to as " network " regulations but actually each one of them applies to individual licensees rather than to the networks as such . These rules are restrictive of the conduct of individual licensees as well as that of network organizations . I stress this because I want to be sure that you do not get the impression that I am urging the removal of these provisions from the bill in the interest of the networks and contrary to the interests of affiliates of the networks or the general public . As I see it , the interests of both the networks and their affiliates are the same . They are entitled to freedom from undue restraint in their business practices . Any regulation of network affiliation , in the interest of flexibility , should be carried out by the Commission in the light of actual conditions as they exist from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 333(b) states that no person shall own more than one network in a single broadcast band . This section is the counterpart of FCC rule 3.107 , but it brings a new concept into the Act which I think is unwise . Rule 3.107 has been complied with and is of no present practical significance to us . It is important to note that the FCC rule , like the other network regulations , applies to licensees directly and only indirectly to a person engaged in operating more than one network . Section 333(b) undertakes to go beyond   the treatment of licensees and applicants for licenses and would introduce into the Act for the first time an additional area of regulation over network organizations which are not necessarily licensees . In my opinion , it is unnecessary for this additional step to be taken and I see no reason for enlarging the scope of the Act in this respect . Section 333(c) ( 1 ) provides that no person shall own or control more than one broadcast station in any single band when such stations cover the same or substantially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms " substantially the same area , " and it would seem to be preferable to allow the Commission to make its own determination in each case as to what conforms to the public interest . This would avoid the possible result of automatically eliminating a grant of a license in a case where the public interest would be served and the only objection to the grant was that the area served would be substantially the same as an area already served by the applicant . Section 333(c) ( 2 ) , insofar as it provides that the Commission shall make no rule fixing the maximum number of stations which may be licensed to any person , is good , but I see no foundation whatever for a limitation based on the number of people served in the continental United States . I think it is undesirable to make such an arbitrary distinction . The proposed limitation of 25% of the population would make it possible for one licensee to have a large number of stations in the smaller markets of the country , whereas those serving large metropolitan markets would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible for one licensee under this proposed 25% limitation to have a large number of stations covering as many as 28 states . As you gentlemen well know , population is not the only thing that counts in government ? geographical areas are important too and they have been since the beginning of this country . The states which might be served by one licensee , in accordance with this provision ? the population of which would be less than 25% of that of the United States ? would represent more than half of the votes in the Senate . Therefore , if it is control of thought that is feared , or control of political opinion , it can not be eliminated , in my opinion , on any arithmetical basis . My recommendation is that no limit as to the number of stations be specified in the Act and that the Commission fix no limit which would prevent it from deciding each application on its own merits in the public interest . Section 20 of the bill would add a new Section 334 prohibiting the utterance of any obscene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false accusation or charge . Insofar as obscenity , indecency or profanity are concerned , there is , of course , no room for doubt . Such material is prohibited by the present Act in Section 326 and such prohibition should remain .   However , the inclusion of a prohibition against the making of any false accusation or charge does not seem to me to be the proper approach to this problem . To make it a crime would place a licensee in jeopardy to such an extent that he would have to be unduly cautious in permitting the use of his facilities , particularly for discussions of controversial , public and political questions . Severe as the penalty is , the crime is indefinitely described in the bill merely as a " false accusation or charge . " It might be desirable to have a uniform standard of civil liability for damages in connection with defamation by radio . However , the matter of criminal prosecution ought to be left to local enforcement , in my opinion , and thereby avoid the possibility that Federal authorities might inject themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagreements .  | DURING the past several years we have actively participated with other members of the industry in discussions and hearings looking forward to a modernization of the radio law . We welcome the introduction of S. 1333 , as calling attention to the need for changes in the law , and I appreciate this opportunity to express my views upon the proposed amendments to the Communications Act of 1934 . Freedom of the Air Is Essential Representatives of the Columbia Broadcasting System who have appeared in the past regarding broadcasting laws have emphasized one central theme in their testimony : the necessity for a free and democratic radio in the United States . William S. Paley , then President of CBS and now Chairman of the Board , stated in 1942 before the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce that : " ... the first and fundamental requirement for radio broadcasting is that it should be kept completely free . . . freedom of the air is at least as important to the American people as freedom of the press . " Again in 1943 , testifying before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " The one fundamental safeguard which is paramount if we are to avoid complete government control of radio is a straight- forward prohibition against the Commission concerning itself with the program policies or business practices of radio stations . " There is no question in my mind that broadcasting must be freed from government interference or control if it is to serve its democratic function in our nation . Unfortunately , broadcasting today is only half free . It has been singled out among all the media of communication of thought for government regulation . Although originally conceived in order to prevent technical interference among radio stations , the role of government has continued to expand with respect to broadcasting until today there are regulations for business practices and , recently , for program content . This inching-up process by government , if continued , will become a regimental march . This is not unusual ? it is the normal concomitant of government regulation , and is generally accompanied by the highest motives on the part of the men in government who do the regulating . Radio Should Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that broadcasting is not a common carrier nor a public utility . Nor is broadcasting like the ordinary manufacturing and distributing industries . It is rather an integral part of our great modern media of communication . Radio addresses the mind through the ear , the newspapers and magazines through the eye , but both communicate information and entertainment to the minds of the people . With the dissemination of news by facsimile broadcasting , even this difference will disappear . There is no doubt today that a free radio is as vital to a free press as the newspapers and magazines . Having gone through its birth and adolescence these past few decades , radio is ready to claim its majority ? equal rights with the press under the law . To be as free as the press , radio must be equally free from government controls of programs and business . As long as necessary , the government should allocate frequencies and grant licenses to broadcast , just as the government allocated scarce newsprint supplies to the printed press while necessary . Anything more is contrary to the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from governmental interference . I say radio should be as free as the press despite obsolete but lingering theories that radio is a field of scarcity and natural monopoly , while the printed press is unlimited and democratic . History has caught up with these theories . During this year there are in operation or on their way more than 2,500 radio stations , and there will be still more . There are only 1,700 English-language daily newspapers in the United States . Theoretical scarci- ties in broadcasting have expanded into practical plenty ; theoretical plenty in the newspaper world has been contracting into practical scarcity . If in past years the scarcity theory had any validity as an excuse for government intrusion into business practices or program policies of broadcasting , it is certainly not valid today . Technical engineering considerations involving frequency allocations , station licenses and station broadcast apparatus should not stultify the basic traditions of free press and free speech which are applicable to radio . Radio , although as unknown to our founding fathers as our great modern newspapers , is just as much a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , I believe that the present Act , as well as the proposed legislation , should be measured by the same standard as the press . That calls for a new approach to the Communications Act ? certainly as the Act has been recently interpreted and administered by the Federal Communications Commission . All provisions other than those relating strictly to the allocation of frequencies , the granting of licenses , and the technical operation of broadcasting apparatus seem to me inappropriate in the Communications Act . I am not asking that radio broadcasting be placed above the law . Broadcasting is and should be subject to applicable general laws , just as are newspapers , magazines , and other businesses . There is no reason why broadcasting , which is not a common carrier or a public utility , should be subject to additional burdens from government interference . I want to urge as strongly as I can that anything short of a full recognition of radio 's right of free speech is bound to result in compromises and uncertainties and increasing government control . Nevertheless , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to comment briefly on some provisions which require special mention . Radio Programs Must Be Free from Government Interference ) ' The proposed Section 326(b) should be the cornerstone for the foundation of a free radio . The cornerstone as it is now proposed , however , has a fundamental flaw . After providing that the Commission shall have no power to affect or control material to be broadcast , the section concludes with this proviso : " that nothing herein contained shall be construed to limit the authority of the Commission in its consideration of applications for renewal of licenses to determine whether or not the licensee has operated in the public interest . "   It seems clear that the rights sought to be conferred in the first part of the section are completely taken away by the proviso . Further , the proviso may well be construed as sweeping statutory authority for the Commission to inject itself even more deeply into the program policies of stations . It is my fear that if such a proviso were enacted into law the program schedules of broadcasters would be even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be " in the public interest . " In that event , a broadcaster who desired to continue in business would conform his programs to the desires of this governmental agency , rather than to the desires of his listeners . The difference has sometimes been drawn between over-all program review by the FCC and specific program review . In the field of thought , this is a distinction without an ultimate difference . I ask you to consider whether you would be willing to authorize any government agency to review the over-all content of newspapers as a prerequisite to continued publication . Over-all program regulation by a government agency which has a life-anddeath licensing power must ultimately seep down into specific programs . As a matter of fact , over-all program review by a government agency can be more dangerous than supervision of specific programs because it is less susceptible to the test of public opinion . Further , I do not believe for an instant that any small group of men in a regulatory body can have an adequate contact with the needs and desires of listeners throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers and program directors throughout the country , because of their daily occupation in serving their listeners , are much better qualified as practical judges of what is in the public interest than any Commission sitting in Washington . I strongly recommend that the proposed Section 326(b) be changed by eliminating the proviso and by including appropriate additional language to make certain , beyond the peradventure of a doubt , that there shall be no governmental interference with program content . Accordingly , I suggest that the language of Section 326(b) should be amended along the following lines : " Nothing in this Act shall be understood or construed to give the Commission the power of censorship over the radio communications or signals transmitted by any radio station or in any way to interfere with the right of free speech by means of radio communication , and no regulation , condition or requirement shall be promulgated , fixed , or imposed by the Commission relating to , and no license or construction permit shall be issued , denied , or revoked because of , programs or program material of radio stations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of S. 1333 proposes to amend Section 15 of the Act by a more precise definition of the fairness rules applicable to broadcasts during political campaigns . Just as there are no Congressional rules regulating the publication of newspapers and magazines during political campaigns , such regulations with respect to broadcasting are inappropriate . Moreover , I am not aware of such malpractice in the maintenance of fairness by broadcasters during political campaigns that such legislation is required . It is impossible to legislate fairness . I am convinced that no mathematical formula , no matter how detailed , will insure that result . Because of a multitude of uncontrollable factors , available listeners and actual listeners vary from hour to hour , day to day , and week to week . So , also , are there differences in delivery , content and personality among speakers . In an effort to plug all possible loopholes , the detailed provisions of the proposed Section 315 might well have the effect of inducing a large number of stations to refuse to carry political broadcasting at all . The minutiae of the proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it is possible in the course of a political campaign to avoid unintentional violation of some prohibition . Without going into detail , I can tell you that even with the resources for checking and cross-checking which the Columbia network possesses , and which are obviously much greater than those possessed by the ordinary station , I am not at all sure that we could go through a presidential campaign free of violation under the proposed section . I recommend that Section 315 of the Act , as well as of the bill , be eliminated because it is unworkable as a practical matter and similar provisions are not applicable to newspapers and magazines . I have the same general comments to make about Section 17 of the bill , which proposes additional provisions in the law with respect to the discussion of public or political questions . Broadcasters have made an enviable record in this field of broadcasting . In a recent national independent survey , 91 per cent of the respondents with opinions stated that radio stations are generally fair in giving both sides of an argument ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or newspapers . I should like to comment just briefly , also , on the provision of the proposed Section 330 which would require a radio station to provide time in reply to a speaker on a political or public question to the extent of twice the amount available to the original user . As we all know , a speaker in reply seldom limits himself to exactly the same points made by the original speaker . If broadcasters attempted to confine a speaker in reply to the points raised by the original speaker , we would soon hear the cry of censorship .   If broadcasters do not attempt this kind of control ? and I do not for a moment think they should ? then , if A speaks upon a question and time is given to B and C to reply , both B and C may make new points which would require replies from D and E and from F and G. The requirement for twice the number of replies results in a geometric progression which could , conceivably , exhaust the entire broadcast schedule of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of news sources , is another example of the impracticability of laying down specific operating rules in a statute . While responsible broadcasters will agree with the purpose of the section , we believe that the purpose is best accomplished by voluntary adherence to a high professional standard in the field of news and news analysis just as in the newspaper field . Radio Should Have Equal Business Rights The FCC in recent years has concerned itself more and more with the business practices of broadcasters . This is evidenced in a number of ways : the requirement that broadcasters file voluminous financial and operating reports and the emphasis which the FCC has placed on operating practices in its consideration of license applications and in some of its reports . This line is being followed , without apparent abatement , in spite of the clear distinction made in the Act between common carriers and radio broadcasters . It is encouraging to us to note that Senator White has taken cognizance of this situation and in his remarks accompanying S. 1333 points out that the proposed Section 326(a) specifically states that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business of the licensee of any radio broadcast station , except where that power is specifically conferred by the act itself . " All broadcasters will , I am sure , agree with the purpose of this amendment . However , I think it is desirable to make the language of Section 326(a) even more specific . The denial of the power of the Commission to " regulate " may be construed as permitting the Commission to concern itself with business practices so long as such concern falls short of a technical regulation of the business of the broadcasters . Accordingly , I suggest that the language be clarified along the following lines : " Nothing in this Act shall be understood or construed to give the Commission the power to regulate the business of the licensee of any radio broadcast station , and , anything in this Act to the contrary notwithstanding , no regulation , condition or requirement shall be promulgated , fixed or imposed by the Commission relating to , and no license or construction permit shall be issued , denied or  | revoked , because of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business policies of the station . " In that connection , it should be pointed out that the requirement of the proposed Section 303(j) , to the effect that the Commission may prescribe uniform systems of financial reports which may be required to be filed by radio stations , is inconsistent with the purpose of Section 326(a) . For this reason , Section 303(j) as set forth in the bill should be revised so that the reports required of stations are confined to such technical matters as may enable the Commission to determine that the technical operation of the broadcasting apparatus is in accordance with the license . Principle of Non-Discrimination is Endorsed At this point , I wish to endorse the provisions of Section 25 of the bill , which would add a new section to the Act debarring the Commission from discriminating between persons on account of race , religion , politics or lawful occupation or business association . Special Rules are not Required for Network Broadcasting Section 19 of S. 1333 would incorporate , with modifications , the so-called network rules heretofore adopted by the FCC . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopt any similar government regulation of business practices in the press . I see no valid reason for singling out broadcasting . Accordingly , I believe that no statute should attempt to impose such restrictions , and that no administrative agency of government should have that power . We agree with Senator White 's purpose that the Commission shall have no power over the contractual relationship between stations and networks . It should be pointed out , also , that the anti-trust laws and other general business laws are fully applicable to stations and networks , and are fully effective to restrain unlawful or monopolistic practices in this field . We believe that these general restraints provided by existing statutory law are adequate . If , however , the Committee decides that special business rules are necessary for radio , I wish to make clear that we would prefer that the limits of any such rules should be set by the Congress , rather than left to the discretion of the FCC . In that way , we at least will have the benefit of adequate discussion of specific rules before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unexpected changes from time to time . We , of course , hope that the Committee will agree with our strong belief that special regulation of the business practices of broadcasting is unneces- sary and undesirable . In particular , however , I would like to comment on one provision of the bill 's network rules . This is the proposed Section 333(a) ( 4 ) , which would prohibit affiliation contracts in which so-called option periods of the stations given to the networks total " more than two hours in any consecutive three-hour period . " This provision is more restrictive than the existing FCC rules on the subject . To my knowledge , there has been no demand for this change from independently-owned affiliated stations . In fact , in 1943 , during the consideration of an amendment to S. 814 incorporating such a change , a committee of the National Association of Broadcasters , representing the individual independent and affiliated stations in the United States , registered its opposition to such a provision . The most obvious and substantial effect of such a two-out-of-three hour rule would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hours of prime evening time to network advertisers . A strong and adequate schedule of popular network commercial programs is not only advantageous to affiliated stations in producing substantial revenue , but also contributes to the over-all popularity of the station because of the strong listener appeal which such programs command . In addition , of course , this restriction would tend to impair the financial strength of networks , with a consequent general impairment in the quality of nationwide broadcasting . Station Ownership Should not be Arbitrarily Restricted The proposed new Section 333(c) ( 2 ) purports to limit the number of broadcast stations owned or controlled by a single licensee to a number which would provide primary service to no more than 25 per cent of the population of the continental United States . This is a unique attempt to limit the expansion of broadcasters in the broadcasting field . In my opinion , it is unwise and detrimental to the welfare of broadcasting . As Senator White has pointed out , present rules of the FCC have arbitrarily limited the number of FM and television stations which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the limit is set at six stations , and in television the limit is set at five . Further , the FCC has , as a practical matter , frozen the number of standard broadcast stations which may be owned by the larger broadcast companies . There is no other field ? industrial , utility , or otherwise ? that I know of in which the government has set a fixed ceiling on the size of an enterprise . Even the Public Utility Holding Company Act , providing specific anti-trust legislation in the utility field , does not set arbitrary limits in terms of units , size or population . In the newspaper and magazine field there has been no attempt by Congress or any government agency to restrict growth   by an arbitrary standard . It is difficult to understand why broadcasting should be singled out for special legislation of this unique type . We agree with Senator White that so important a matter should not be left to decisions made by administrative edict . However , the proposed new Section 333(c) ( 2 ) , which , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , purports to limit the number of broadcast stations owned or controlled by a single licensee , is equally arbitrary . If broadcasting were monopoly-ridden , presumably there would be a host of accompanying evils which would invite special attention by Congress .   To my knowledge , there is no bill of particulars of monopoly evils in broadcasting for the simple reason that there is no monopoly . In order to get a fuller perspective , it is appropriate to compare broadcasting with some of the other American industries . Immediately , it becomes apparent that broadcasting is not " big business . " For example , the entire broadcasting industry 's volume in 1946 was substantially less than that of some single companies in other fields , a few of which are shown in Chart 1 . Just as the broadcasting industry is not big business compared with other industries , the individual broadcasting companies are small in relation to the industry as a whole . The stations owned by CBS are : WCBS , New York ; WLEI , Boston ; WBBM , Chicago ; KNX , Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total number of stations in the industry as of December 31 , 1946 , and accounted for 7.66 per cent of the aggregate nighttime wattage . The relative position of CBS-owned stations ? expressed both in terms of number of stations and in aggregate station nighttime wattage ? is shown in the following chart .   It may be noted here that the number of newspapers owned by the largest chain is nearly three times the number of radio stations owned by any network , both in number of units and in proportion to the entire units in the industry . Other measures of the relative position of the CBS-owned stations are a comparison of the rates which they charge and the revenues which they derive , compared with the rates and revenues of the broadcasting industry as a whole . In 1946 the nighttime hourly rate for the Columbia-owned stations represented 3.62 per cent of the aggregate nighttime hourly rate of the industry , and CBS-owned stations accounted for 4.90 per cent of the aggregate time sales of all stations for the same year . The CBS position in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chart . It is interesting to compare the relative position of the Columbia Broadcasting System in the broadcasting industry with that of single companies in other industries . While the CBS share of station revenue , as shown on the foregoing chart , is only 4.90 per cent , the addition of network revenue ( less 159   payments to affiliated stations ) , results in a CBS share of total broadcasting revenue of only 10.7 per cent . According to a staff report in connection with H. Res. 64 of the 79th Congress , relating to Small Business , in some industries a single company accounts for as much as 85 per cent of the total industry product . Appendix B is a copy of a compilation taken from the report , indicating a selection of fifty-nine industries where the proportion accounted for by a single company ranged from 5 per cent to 85 per cent . Section 333(c) ( 2 ) would , if enacted , preclude any expansion of CBS operation of standard broadcast stations , and would even seriously jeopardize present operations . This section of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new measurement device keyed to population . This is the exact opposite of Congressional action in the field of the press . In fact , Congress has encouraged the expansion of magazine and newspaper circulation by providing special mailing privileges . The most unusual feature , however , of Section 333(c) ( 2 ) is that the 25 per cent limitation applies to potential rather than actual listeners . Thus , while any national magazine , for example , has a potential circulation among all the people in the nation ? a 100 per cent potential ? the radio stations owned by any single company would be limited to a 25 per cent potential . This curious concept results in some interesting comparisons when the figures of actual audiences to CBS-owned stations are projected to areas which could be considered as having " primary service " under various alternatives. * Chart 4 reflects the population figures under various possible definitions of " primary service " and the number of potential listeners to the CBS-owned stations compared with those who actually listen to the average program broadcast by these stations . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations varies from 15.8 per cent to 37.6 per cent under various engineering definitions , while the actual listening to the average program broadcast by these stations varies from .36 per cent to 2.27 per cent of the total U.S. population . Thus , there is a vast discrepancy between actual and potential listeners . Competition among stations for listeners is the essence of broadcasting . No station reaches the entire population within hearing distance . Within the leading metropolitan markets in which the CBS-owned stations are located , a large number of stations compete for listeners . For example , there are 23 competing stations in the New York metropolitan district alone ,   and there are an aggregate of 71 competing stations in the remaining six metropolitan districts where CBS owns stations . No business operation can remain healthy and dynamic if it is prevented from growing . The anti-trust laws are fully applicable to broadcasting and should govern in this field as in others in the determination of what constitutes over-size or restraint of trade . Certainly there is no reason why Congress or any governmental agency should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industries . The newspapers , magazines and broadcasters are all competitors for audience and advertising revenue , and any governmental action which limits broadcasters ' ability to compete with other media is unfair class legislation . Further , as indicated above , the provision of S. 1333 is too uncertain to enable broadcasters to determine what their position would be under such a law . Engineering standards are not fixed , and can be changed from time to time . In fact , we may expect new standards to be devised in the future as they have been in the past . Fluctuating standards , whether they apply to daytime service or nighttime service , would leave broadcasters without any assurance of the validity of their operations . I submit that no arbitrary limit should be placed upon growth of broadcasting companies , either by the FCC or by Congressional action . It is better to leave this to the determination of the courts as is done in other private enterprises . In any event , if the Congress shall decide that a statutory standard should be applied to radio broadcasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) should relate to a percentage of determinable factors , such as number of total units in the industry , total business of the industry , total power of all stations , or the like , and ( b ) should relate to actualities , not potentialities , and ( c ) should not be less in percentage size than accepted lawful practice in other industries . In conclusion , therefore , I urge this committee to turn radio back to the broadcasters and the public and to minimize the legitimate role of government in this field . No governmental rules can accomplish improvement in the industry as effectively as broadcasters themselves . The broadcasting industry , through the National Association of Broadcasters , is now working out upto-date standards of practice . These efforts at industry self-help are the democratic way to correct industry abuses and elevate its standards . Broadcasting is a comparatively young industry , and I urge you to give it full opportunity to develop itself as an outstanding medium of information and entertainment , just as you have the printed press of the country .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the statement of Mr. Frank Stanton . It is our position that radio should be treated on an equal footing with the press , and that any provisions in the Act or in S. 1333 which are inconsistent with such equality should be eliminated or revised . My statement should be considered in that light . I will comment only on certain sections not specifically referred to by Mr. Stanton , which seem to me to require special comment . Procedural Amendments We wish to endorse the provisions of S. 1333 relating to matters of procedure insofar as those provisions do not detract from the rights of parties conferred by the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 . We agree with the purposes of the procedural amendments as outlined by Senator White on introduction of the bill . However , I have not as yet made a sufficiently detailed comparison of the provisions of S. 1333 with the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act to determine , to my own satisfaction , the interpretation to he applied to differing provisions of S. 1333 and the Administrative Procedure Act which relate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Section 12 of the Administrative Procedure Act provides , in part : " No subsequent legislation shall be held to supersede or modify the provisions of this Act except to the extent that such legislation shall do so expressly . "   Until there is some clear judicial determination of the effect of subsequent legislation differing from that Act , but not stating in so many words that the Act is superseded or modified , I would prefer to avoid the difficult problems of interpretation which might arise under S. 1333 if it should be contended that the rights of parties under the bill would be less than under the Administrative Procedure Act . Changes in Accepted Concepts Should Not Be Made by Amending Definitions " BROADCASTING " Section 2 of the bill would amend subsection ( o ) of Section 3 of the Act by limiting the scope of the term " broadcasting . " The present definition in the Act is : " ( o ) Broadcasting ' means the dissemination of radio communications intended to be received by the public , directly or by the intermediary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read : " ( o ) Broadcasting means the dissemination of radio communications intended to be received directly by the public . " So far as I am aware , no question has been raised concerning the meaning and operation of the definition of " broadcasting " as it exists in the present Act . The purpose of the amendment , accordingly , is unclear , and may lead to administrative and judicial interpretations not presently foreseeable . The restricted meaning which S. 1333 would give to the term " broadcasting " may in practice be most undesirable . As a single example , many operators of stations also operate small mobile units or relay stations which are used in the pick-up of special events in the absence of telephone lines . While these mobile or relay stations directly operated by broadcasters are not themselves broadcast stations , they are operated directly in combination with the station which transmits the program to the receivers in the homes of the public . Thus , such an operation is an integral part of " broadcasting . " As a further example : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of relay stations ? that is , the affiliated stations which comprise the network . It might even be contended , under the proposed definition , that network broadcasting was not " broadcasting . " I am sure it was not intended by the proposed change in this definition to exclude mobile stations or network operations from the general classi- fication of " broadcasting " administered under Title III of the Act , and to throw them under Title II and thus make them subject to rules applicable to common carriers . However , if the change in the law were made as proposed , an interpretation along this line might well be advanced . Accordingly , I suggest that because there is no substantial dissatisfaction with the operation of the definition of " broadcasting " as presently set forth in the Act , no change should be made in the definition which might raise doubts as to the status of operations heretofore considered an integral part of " broadcasting . " " NETWORK BROADCASTING " If radio broadcasting 's equal status with the press is to be given statutory recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for network broadcasting in the statute . In this event , and if Section 303 ( i ) is deleted as hereinafter suggested , it serves no useful purpose to include a definition of " network broadcasting , " and Section 3 ( p ) should be deleted from the Act . However , if such a definition is included , any implication that network broadcasting , as such , might be construed as a common-carrier activity should be negatived . Section 3 ( h ) negatives such an implication insofar as broadcasting alone is concerned . Accordingly , there should be added the following sentence to Section 3 ( p ) : " A person engaged in network or chain broadcasting shall not , insofar as such person is so engaged , be deemed a common carrier . " Division of the Commission is Desirable The broadcasting industry has , in general , recorded its endorsement of the division of the Commission into a common-carrier division and a broadcasting division . A similar provision contained in S. 814 was endorsed by a committee of the National Association of Broadcasters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White in his remarks accompanying the introduction of S. 1333 clearly reflect the need for broadcasting to be freed from the influence of public utility concepts . While endorsing the provisions of Section 5 of the bill , which would accomplish this separation , it is perhaps appropriate to make three comments : First , in subsection ( d ) the provision which would empower the whole Commission to adopt and promulgate " all rules and regulations of gen- eral application authorized by this Act , including procedural rules and regulations for the Commission and the Divisions thereof , " may , in practice , substantially vitiate the beneficial effects expected from a separation of functions . Much of the action of the Commission which broadcasters have felt has been undesirable has been accomplished by the promulgation of rules and regulations " of general application . " The application of such rules or regulations has been " general " in the sense that they have applied to all situations within a given category , even though that category was confined to broadcasting or even to a specified class of stations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( d ) could be improved , in my opinion , if it read : " Each Division shall adopt and promulgate all rules and regulations of general application relating to questions of substance within the jurisdiction of such Division . The whole Commission shall have and exercise jurisdiction over the adoption and promulgation of procedural rules and regulations of the Commission and the Divisions thereof . " Second , subsection ( a ) would be improved if it were revised to provide that each member of the Commission , during his term of office , remain a member of the Division to which he is originally assigned . Third , it may be inappropriate to confine the duties of the Chairman of the Commission to those merely of an executive officer . Such housekeeping functions might better be performed by an employee of the Commission . In such event , the Chairman of the whole Commission , during his term of chairmanship , could serve as a member of one of the divisions , and the number of commissioners should then be reduced from seven to six . No Special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed revision of subsection ( i ) of Section 303 is most desirable in making it plain that the Commission is without statutory power to make rules and regulations covering business practices or program policies of stations engaged in chain broadcasting . The proposed revision that special regulations of stations engaged in chain broadcasting be limited to technical apparatus and technical operations is entirely consistent with Section 19 of the bill and Senator White 's remarks on introduction of the bill . However , it should be pointed out that the provisions of present subsections ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) , ( e ) and ( f ) of Section 303 , which apply to all   radio stations , whether engaged in chain broadcasting or not , are sufficiently broad to cover the technical matters provided for in the proposed subsection ( i ) , and , as a matter of statutory construction , its inclusion might prove confusing . Accordingly , it would seem preferable to accomplish the desired result by deleting the existing subsection ( i ) instead of amending it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bill would amend subsection ( b ) of Section 310 of the Act , relating to transfers of licenses . Heretofore the Commission was required to find that the transfer is in the public interest , while the proposed amendment requires a finding that the " proposed transferee or assignee possesses the qualifications required of an original permittee or licensee . " In actual practice , the Commission has tended to inject the elements of a competitive hearing in a proceeding in which both parties desire that a station license be granted to the transferee . In order to assure that the bill will cure this anomalous approach and put no greater burden upon a proposed transferee than upon an original applicant , it is suggested that Section 13 of the bill could be improved if the last sentence thereof were deleted and the following were substituted therefor : " If upon examination of any application provided for in this section the Commission shall find that the proposed transferee or assignee possesses the qualifications required of an original permittee or licensee , the Commission shall authorize the transfer or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing . " Broadcasters Should Not be Subject to Special Jeopardy Under the Anti-Trust Laws Broadcasters believe that they should be put on an equal footing with other business with respect to the anti-trust laws . At the present time , they are subject to a death sentence ? in terms of loss of license ? if a court should find that they have violated the anti-trust laws . This is a penalty which is not applied to any other business . We believe that broadcasters should be subject to the anti-trust laws to as full an extent as other businesses , including the same penalties of triple damages , fine , imprisonment and dissolution . Under Section 313 a court is given specific authority , without any reference to the appropriateness of the penalty , to revoke the broadcasting   license of any licensee found guilty of the violation of the anti-trust laws . Section 311 specifically directs the Commission to refuse a license to any person whose license has been revoked by a court under Section 313 and specifically authorizes the Commission , without regard to any other factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of violating the antitrust laws . Thus , the Commission may ( and if a license is revoked by a court in the anti-trust proceedings , the Commission must ) forever refuse a station license to a person who has been found by a court to have violated the anti-trust laws . This amounts to a permanent loss of the rights of citizenship insofar as engaging in radio broadcasting is concerned , and , so far as I know , is a penalty which does not apply to any other type of misconduct , including crimes for which capital punishment may be imposed . It is submitted that these penalties are not only unique , but unduly onerous and discriminatory . Accordingly , Sections 311 and 313 should be amended by preserving the statutory declaration that the anti-trust laws are applicable to radio and that the granting of a license shall not stop antitrust suits and prosecutions , and by deleting the special penalty provisions above mentioned . This can be accomplished by retaining the last sentence of Section 311 and the first sentence of 313 , so that these sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granting of a license shall not estop the United States or any person aggrieved from proceeding against such person for violating the law against unfair methods of competition or for a violation of the law against unlawful restraints and monopolies and/or combinations , contracts , or agreements in restraint of trade , or from instituting proceedings for the dissolution of such corporation . " " Sec. 313 . All laws of the United States relating to unlawful restraints and monopolies and to combinations , contracts , or agreements in restraint of trade are hereby declared to be applicable to the manufacture and sale of and to trade in radio apparatus and devices entering into or affecting interstate or foreign commerce and to interstate or foreign radio communications . " Scope of FCC Inquiries Should be Limited Section 308 ( b ) of the Act provides authority for the Commission to require information from applicants and licensees relating to " citizenship , character , and financial , technical and other qualifications . . . and such other information as it the FCC may require . "   Under this authority the FCC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business association , personal history , and ? most significantly ? extensive information respecting program schedules . The emphasis which the FCC has indicated it will place upon the programs of radio stations in considering applications is clearly reflected in the Blue Book and in subsequent demands for information . This type of information ? with its direct effect upon business practices and program operations ? is inconsistent with equal treatment of broadcasting under the law . Accordingly , it is suggested that Section 308 ( b ) should be revised by eliminating any authority to require information concerning " character " or " other qualifications , " or " other information . " Information of this nature would be inappropriate if the FCC is to reassume its proper role of confining itself to technical matters , and is not to concern itself with the business practices and program policies of broadcasters . In line with the foregoing , I suggest that Section 319 be revised to eliminate any authority of the Commission to require information concerning " character , " " other ability " or " such other information as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should also be made clear that the facts concerning " the purpose for which the station is to be used " should be limited to the type of station for which a construction permit is desired ? that is , whether the station is to be used for broadcasting , pointto-point or other form of communication . It would also seem desirable to revise this section so as to conform it to the proposed revisions of Sections 307 , 308 and 309 . One way of doing this might be to delete the second sentence of subsection ( a ) of Section 319 and to substitute in lieu thereof , " The procedure for handling such application shall be that provided in Section 309 hereof . " In addition , I suggest the deletion of the second sentence in subsection ( b ) Section 319 so as to avoid any inconsistency with Section 13 of the bill .   AM the President of Mutual Broadcasting System , Inc. , which operates a national network of 432 stations , the Mutual Broadcasting System . Four hundred and thirteen of the stations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My association with network broadcasting goes back to 1934 , when I became Vice President and Sales Manager of the National Broadcasting Company . I was later the Executive Vice President and a Director of the Blue Network Company from 1942 to 1944 , and have been the President and a Director of Mutual Broadcasting System , Inc. since 1944 . I have also had experience in three closely allied fields of electrical engineering , publishing and advertising , having served in editorial , circulation and sales capacities , and as Vice President and a Director of McGrawHill Publishing Company from 1916 to 1934 , and as Vice President of the Lord and Thomas Advertising Agency from 1936 to 1940 . As a preface to my remarks concerning the White Bill , I think I should indicate that the Mutual Broadcasting System is in certain particulars rather differently constituted than the other three national networks . Mutual does not own its key originating stations as do National Broadcasting Company , Columbia Broadcasting System and American Broadcasting Company , but , on the contrary , is itself owned by certain of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information I have attached a list of the shareholder stations showing the number of shares of stock held by each . ( Appendix C. )  | Our shareholders by and large represent some of the oldest and best established elements in American broadcasting . Mutual has also many other affiliated stations . Of our stations , 297 are 250-watt stations , 266 are the only stations located in communities which they serve , 119 are operating under licenses granted by the Commission within the last two years and 19 are not yet on the air . Mutual therefore represents a rather unique combination of stations , large and small , urban and rural , new and old . I have attempted in my study of the bill to consider it from the point of view of the varying components of our network , as well as with a view to our responsibility to the listener . I should like to say that the industry as a whole appreciates the desire of Senator White to improve the present Communications Act . Our criticism of provisions of the proposed bill must not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this desire or as any evidence of hostility to this Committee or to the idea that the Communications Act should be improved . Some of the provisions of the proposed bill look in the right direction . We have pointed these out in the section-by-section analysis which is a part of my statement . ( Appendix D. ) On the other hand , some of the provisions of the bill , or the interpretations that might be placed on them by the Commission or the courts , disturb us a great deal . Our criticism of these provisions , however , is intended to be constructive , not destructive . We want you to know exactly what our fears are , so that you can consider them in your legislative work . My own interest in radio is far from an academic one . In my work with three national networks during the past several years , I have watched with keen interest the rapid growth of broadcasting . I hope my own efforts may have made some small contribution toward that growth . The job of running a radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are many questions of operation and of policy which make exacting demands upon intelligence and good conscience . Broadcasting is still suffering from growing pains . Broadcasting , as we know it today , may be technically out-moded within the next few years . If broadcasting is to realize its full potential , it needs room to grow , encouragement rather than restraint . I regret to say that our examination of the White Bill does not reveal that it contains provisions adequately guaranteeing the freedom essential for the proper development of broadcasting . On the contrary we feel that the bill in certain sections ratifies and approves an unwarranted control by the Federal Communications Commission of programs broadcast by radio stations and of the business practices of the licensees . Moreover , in our  | opinion , the bill saddles the industry with new , burdensome and unnecessary restrictions . The bill contains two different types of provisions , namely , procedural provisions and substantive provisions . The procedural provisions embrace such subjects as organization of the Commission , reports of the Commission , hearings before the Commission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The substantive provisions cover such matters as control of program content , political broadcasts , broadcasts on public questions , etc . The procedural sections of the bill , by and large , concern themselves with matters upon which lawyers and others schooled in administrative procedure are much better qualified than I to comment . Before passing to the substantive provisions , however , I should like to comment briefly upon Sec. 5 of the bill , dealing with the organization of the Commission . Organization of the Commission The bill proposes to divide the Commission into two divisions of three members each , one division to render decisions in cases involving broadcasting stations and the other to render decisions in common-carrier cases . Some persons seem to believe that this is a panacea for all ills at the Commission . In our opinion , this is a delusion . So far as I know , only one malpractice of the Commission could be ascribed to the influence of common-carrier philosophy . That is the requirement of the Commission that broadcast stations and networks furnish the Commission with elaborate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirement seems to be approved by this bill . In my opinion , none of the other excesses of the Commission stem from common-carrier concepts . Even if they did , however , this bill leaves jurisdiction over the most important and controversial problem of broadcasting , the making of general rules and regulations , in the full Commission . Under the plan in the bill , this would mean that the general rules and regulations governing broadcasting would be promulgated by a body of seven men , four of whom had no contact whatsoever with the day-by-day problems of the broadcasting industry . We see no benefit whatever in a compulsory division of the Commission into two divisions and the proposed change in the status of the Chairman . Substantive Provisions The substantive provisions of the White Bill can be roughly classified as technical , economic and program ,   Everyone has conceded at all times that the Commission should have a very broad discretion with respect to technical matters , both in its regulation-making powers and in the rendering of decisions . No one has proposed any limitation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself should attempt to invade this field . The problems with which we are concerned have to do entirely with what kind of power and how much power the Commission should have with respect to economic and program matters . r " The fundamental problem has been the assumption by the Commission of the power to construe the term " public interest , convenience or necessity " as applying to economic or program matters , whereas it seems clear that the original intent was that it applied almost exclusively to technical and physical matters . The economic field of the Commission 's jurisdiction or assumed jurisdiction must be subdivided , since it really involves two distinct subjects . It is one thing for a governmental agency to make laws or regulations designed to promote competition and prevent monopoly . It is quite another thing to talk about regulating the economic aspects of an industry by requiring constant and elaborately detailed reports with respect to finances and labor , to take into account whether a particular city can or can not support a certain number of stations , to consider regulation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are usually thought of as the commoncarrier type of regulations . The bill proceeds to very considerable lengths in giving the Commission power over the economic aspects of the regulation . This I shall discuss separately . When we come to the program aspects of the bill a further subdivision is in order . The practice of the Commission in considering program content on renewal applications is , in our opinion , quite a different thing than the imposition of definite obligations upon station licensees by provisions in the Communications Act itself , such as those requiring equal treatment of candidates for public office and those prohibiting obscene and indecent language . An idea seems to prevail among members of the Commission and others that it is perfectly all right for the Commission to take the so-called " over-all performance " of a station into account in acting on a renewal application . Such a view overlooks the fact that in every decision the Commission must make written findings reciting in detail what the Commission believes to be wrong with the station 's operations . If the Commission objects to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision will specify the particular programs or types of programs upon which the action is based . This in turn means setting up the equivalent of rules or regulations   that such programs or types of programs are henceforth illegal or at least will cause a licensee that broadcasts such programs to lose its license . The result , of course , is a type of control by indirection on the part of the Commission which is both insidious and effective in depriving the licensee of ultimate program control . Program Control Before I get into a discussion of the provisions of the bill affecting program material , I should like to make some general comments on the subject of radio programs . I have investigated many program complaints . I have discussed radio programs with countless civic , educational and religious leaders and organizations . Through the years I have followed broadcasts on political questions and public events with a deep and abiding interest in domestic and international affairs . I have followed educational programs and programs for children with the personal interest of a father and , more recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other aspects of radio programming with the interest of a listener as well as a broadcaster . I believe that I have the background to speak on the subject of programs . I have a deep and abiding faith in the American people . I believe that they know what they want and that they will see that they get it . Two things constantly surprise me regarding many others who profess to hold the processes of a democracy in high veneration . First , is the impatience of some persons with the pace of action by the public . They can not wait for the public to make its own decisions and enforce them , but they must secure immediate action . The results of such short cuts and such hurried extemporizings are inevitably the creation of situations which are not in the best interests of the public and which the public does not desire to prevail . Instead of accelerating the accomplishment of a proper solution , such methods almost inevitably delay or irreparably foreclose it . Second , I am surprised at the assurance with which some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public and arrogate to themselves the omniscient power to determine what the public should want . Radio programs are constantly growing better and better and the broadcasting industry is making continual efforts to improve them . We have formulated program policies calculated to maintain creditable standards for broadcast material . As an example I am submitting herewith a copy of the published program policies of our company . ( Appendix E. ) These policies are not perfect . As a matter of fact , at the present time we are engaged in a  | revision of them . They do represent , however , a voluntary and conscientious effort to set up guide posts of sound programming . All of the measurements of general public opinion which have yet been devised indicate that the general public is reasonably well satisfied with the service it receives from American broadcasters . Nevertheless , broadcasting is constantly being harassed by persons of the typg I have mentioned ? those who are too impatient to wait for the public to eliminate inferior broadcast practices and unworthy broadcasters , and those who purport to know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the public 's throat . Many valuable suggestions have resulted from my conversations with civic , educational and religious leaders , and our organization has done its best to give effect to them . Too many of the complaints against radio , however , are from people who simply do not know what they are talking about . As an example , I should like to rise to the defense of the much-maligned daytime serial . These innocent programs have been the butt of satirists who refer to them as " perpetual emotion , " of reformers who refer to them as " silly soap-operas " and of the Commission which flings the Blue Book at them . I am inclined to think that most of the critics of the daytime serials have never actually listened to them enough to find out what they are really about . Lying somewhere between the newspaper cartoon strip and the continued serial in the better national magazines , the stories they unfold are listened to with interest by shutins and by the busy housewife . It is not strange that a person tuning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serial should consider it silly , just as he might consider silly an isolated excerpt from a magazine story , but the vast segment of the public for whom these programs are designed enjoy them . Obviously a station can not broadcast debates on domestic and foreign affairs all day long . If it did , I think you will agree that few busy housewives would listen . In few communities , however , are the listeners who may dislike daytime serials confined to this fare at any particular hour . Other programs , such as music or talks on home economics , are usually available at the hours of the day when daytime serials are broadcast . Now , with four national networks and a greatly increased number of stations , competition insures a wide range of selection to most listeners . Another bit of radio material which has been savagely lampooned and bitterly denounced is the so-called " singing commercial . " Whether you like them or not ? and I must confess that I consider some of them to be clever and definitely amusing ? they are certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that such a harmless and insignificant thing as this should have aroused such a tempest of denunciation against radio broadcasting ? In spite of the criticism of singing commercials , the general public has indicated in public opinion polls that these jingles are unobjectionable . If and when they do become objectionable to any substantial segment of the public , you may be sure they will disappear from the air waves . The self-appointed critics of radio broadcasting are also constantly talking about " good music . " By " good music " these critics customarily mean the symphonies of Brahms and Beethoven and operatic music . I question the certainty with which these persons consign all music , except classical and semi-classical music , to the realm of second-rate . But even if we accepted this thesis , you would find that these critics usually are not aware of the amount of classical and semi-classical music that is actually broadcast by the radio stations of our country . Not only are the concerts of most of the symphony orchestras in the country regularly broadcast , generally in network broadcasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own regular hours of classical music on records or transcriptions , if they are not rendered by local musicians . I have often wondered why radio is subject to these recurring waves of criticism in books , magazines and newspapers and in speeches by certain individual commissioners . I know it is not because radio is doing a bad job . If you will consider the question dispassionately and without preconceived notions , I believe you will agree that the radio broadcasting industry is doing a better job than any other medium of mass communication , in spite of the uncertainties under which it operates . It has been suggested that the printed sniping at radio results from the jealousy of other media and a desire to injure a commercial rival . I believe , however , that these attacks have a deeper significance and one more creditable to our competitors . I believe that , basically , they stem from the intense interest of the public in all aspects of radio and from the fact that the public considers radio as peculiarly its own . Accordingly , anything written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more interesting reading than praise . As long as the public preserves its present interest in radio , you may safely rely upon public opinion to control it and to see that it gives the public what the public desires in the way of programs . You may also rely upon self-appointed critics to continue to tell the public what it should want . I have no desire to stop them or to have them quieted . Now let us turn to the provisions of the bill which express an unjustified distrust of the choice that the public might make or a doubt , wholly  | unwarranted by history , of the ability of the public to enforce its desires without governmental intervention . Censorship In the section-by-section digest released by Senator White concurrently with the introduction of the bill , it was said that Section 16 of the bill " makes it clear that the Commission does not have the authority to tell a licensee , directly or indirectly , what he can broadcast or can not broadcast , or how he should run his day-by-day business . " Apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ validity of the arguments I have made regarding the desirability of fostering program control by public opinion and apparently these proponents have the same objective in mind as the broadcasting industry . This objective is the abolition of program control by the whims , fancies and prejudices of an administrative agency of seven men . Unfortunately , we do not believe that Section 16 accomplishes its avowed purpose . On the contrary , we believe that it actually confirms and ratifies the very practices by which the Commission has gradually been edging into control of the programs broadcast by radio stations and into control of their business practices . I can only assume , therefore , that the proponents of this bill are not actually aware of the exact instruments used by the Commission and of the manner in which they are used . This is probably due to the indirectness of the Commission 's methods and to the fact that encroachments on program control by the Commission are inevitably announced by it in the noblest of phrases . If the announced objectives of Section 16 are to be accomplished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section of the bill , expressly negative the Commission 's assumed power to consider program content in any manner in applying the standard of " public interest , convenience or necessity " in proceedings upon applications for renewal of licenses . So long as the Commission can threaten radio stations with the loss of their licenses , if the radio stations fail to conform with the Commission 's ideas as to proper program content , the Commission will be able to exercise a censorship of the most effective character . The mere insertion in the Act of pious denunciations of censorship and vague policy pronouncements against Commission control of program content and business practices is not enough . The present Act contains express guarantees of freedom of speech by radio , which for some . These freedom-of-speech guarantees have been lithely ignored by the Commission in its assumptions of power over prorams , however , and thus far the Commission has successfully avoided a upreme Court test of their effect . Accordingly , nothing short of an express denial by Congress of any ight in the Commission to discipline stations on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be truly effective to relieve he broadcasting industry from Commission interference with business ractices and program content . statutory Requirements Concerning Program Content he presence in the White Bill of those sections relating to political broadasts , discussions of public questions , identification of news sources and alse accusations is somewhat puzzling to me , since I know of no current buses warranting the new and drastic requirements which certain provisions of these sections would impose on radio broadcasters . I had believed there was general agreement that radio is doing an outtanding job in the presentation of discussions of public events and news eports and in the handling of political campaigns . In my opinion , the adio industry has been eminently fair in dealing with matters in this field . Vhy , therefore , should radio now be saddled with burdensome requireaents not applicable to other communication media ? The undesirability of these new requirements can only be fully realized ' hen they are examined against the background of the present operations of he industry . Political Broadcasts ' he proposed amendments in Section 15 of the bill relating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in part , indifferent and , in part , exceedingly bad . Unless the undesirable provisions are eliminated , the Lmendments should not , in my opinion , be adopted . The proposed amendment relieving the licensee from liability for the broadcasting of defamatory matter contained in speeches which the licensee s forbidden to censor seems to me only common justice . My only criticism f this particular amendment is that the protection accorded the licensee only extends to liability for defamation , and invasion of privacy or " any similar liability . " The amendment should protect the licensee against any   liability whatsoever , whether it is or is not similar , if the licensee is prohibited from exercising any censorship . So far as the amendments extend the rights of equal opportunity to candidates in primary elections and define " equal opportunity , " the amendments are of indifferent practical value , since they largely conform with present practices of the industry . However , I should like to point out that the definition of " equal opportunity , " for the first time , creates an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a network to furnish the same grouping of stations to one candidate that it has furnished to another . Incidentally , however , it confers no corresponding right on the network to compel its independent affiliated stations to accept such a program . This phase of the amendment is therefore rendered impossible of performance . No substantial evil calls for an amendment such as that which prohibits political broadcasts during or for 24 hours in advance of an election . Not only does this put broadcasting at an unwarranted disadvantage as against the press but it wholly ignores and nullifies radio 's tremendous capacity and efficiency in stimulating civic responsibility and causing citizens to vote . One proposed amendment of the section on political broadcasts , however , involves a fundamental aspect of the right of free speech . This amendment forbids the use of a station for discussion for or against political candidates by any persons except the candidates themselves , persons designated by them or persons designated by their political parties . This is patently absurd . Since when have American citizens , as well as religious and civic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public office ? If the section on political broadcasts of the present Act is to be amended , it seems to us imperative that it be so modified as to preclude the Commission from requiring radio stations to recognize as legally qualified candidates persons whose names are not , or can not , be included on the official ballot in the particular election . Discussion of Public Questions Section 17 of the White Bill , which introduces a new requirement that radio stations afford equal opportunities for the presentation of different views on public questions or issues , is undesirable and highly impractical . There never will be agreement as to what constitutes a controversial issue of public importance , as distinguished from an issue on which only a few cranks disagree . On most issues there are not merely two but many schools of thought . It is not always possible to determine what persons are best qualified to represent the several schools of thought and at the same time are sufficiently   well informed and sufficiently able speakers so that the broadcasts will be interesting and informative to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both Houses of Congress many times from as far back as 1926 , has been included in a number of bills and has been repeatedly rejected by Congress for the reasons I have given . In my opinion , Congress should continue to reject this proposal . I know of no abuses which justify its inclusion . As a matter of fact the general practice within the entire industry is to lean over backwards in attempting to present all substantial facets of questions of public importance . Identification of News Sources Section 18 , which would add new provisions requiring the identification of news sources , is not merely excessive , but actually impossible , in its apparent requirements as to the identification of sources in detail . A competent news analysis of only fifteen minutes duration frequently contains information from many sources of information , combined with the expert judgment of the analyst . The citation of all the sources would consume a substantial amount of time and would be exceedingly dull to the listener . If only general identification is intended , I believe that the sources of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news sources are identified in other media of communication . All media , of course , must protect the confidence of certain persons who furnish them with news . The treatment of off-the-record statements of high governmental officials is an example of this . The protection of news sources is one of the firmest and most revered tenets in the reporter 's creed . Many reporters have accepted imprisonment in preference to violating this tenet . The social benefits from its observance are unquestionable ; the public receives important news that would otherwise be concealed . False Accusations The new section proposed by the White bill , which would prohibit the broadcasting of a false accusation or charge , is extremely broad and dangerous . The prohibition is not limited to defamatory matter such as would be the basis for an action for libel or slander . It extends to any false accusation or charge . This creates a greater liability than that to which newspapers , magazines or moving pictures are subjected . My attorneys tell me that no recognition is given by this section to the important doctrine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Congressman on the floor of either House or the state- ment of a witness in a trial would not be privileged , as it would be in a libel action . In addition I call your attention to the fact that under the Communications Act a violation might entail a penalty of two years imprisonment and $10,000 fine and revocation of license or the refusal to renew a license . My attorneys have also mentioned that a similar provision was proposed for inclusion in the Radio Act of 1927 and that the Chairman of this Committee then opposed the inclusion of this provision , on the ground that the laws of libel and slander adequately covered this situation . I urge the Chairman 's position as an answer at this time . Network Regulations I shall now direct my attention to the sections of the bill relating to the regulation of stations engaged in network broadcasting and relating to multiple-ownership of stations . We feel that Congresc.would be justified in refraining from legislating on the subject of network broadcasting and in revoking the Commission 's authority to regulate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio broadcasters in a position comparable to that of newspapers and magazines . This position on our part is not , I assure you , dictated by any desire to engage in any of the practices prohibited by the present network regulations or the Federal Communications Act . We have no desire , for example , to change our present contracts with our affiliates , and these contracts conform with the Commission 's network regulations . Turning to the provisions of the White Bill for the regulation of network broadcasting , it seems to me that two serious objections can be made to them , in addition to the objection that an analogy to newspapers should remove them from the bill and from the Commission 's regulations as well . First of all , it seems to me that certain of the prohibitions in the network regulations contained in the White Bill are unsound . The change of permissible option time from three out of five hours ( as provided in the Commission 's present network regulations ) to two out of three hours , with an over-all limit of 50% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat to successful network operations . So far as I know , no complaints have been made that the Commission 's regulation is too generous and no other reason has been advanced for the change in the amount of option time presently permitted by the Commission . In like manner , I find very disturbing the uncertainty of the provision in the White Bill prohibiting the ownership by any network of broadcast stations in any band whose primary service under the standards of good  | engineering practice established by the Commission covers more than 25 per cent of the population of the United States . In view of the controversy that has always existed among radio engineers as to what constitutes primary service and the wide variance in service as between rural and urban communities , as between day and night , and even as between different sections of the country , I am most reluctant to have such a determination left in the hands of the Commission . Of course , the limit of six or seven stations ? which is apparently recognized by the Commission as the limit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitrary , since no consideration is given to the vast difference between the ownership of six 50-kw. clear-channel stations and the ownership of six 250-watt stations which are being used to cover the same area as , and to compete with , one 50-kw. station . Instead of the indefinite provision on multiple-ownership in the White Bill or the arbitrary standard presently enforced by the Commission , I should prefer to have Congress confer , in some appropriately limited fashion , the power upon the Commission to consider the question of the tendency toward monopolization in connection with applications by multiple-station owners for authorization to erect additional stations or to acquire existing stations . In this connection , we believe that Sections 311 and 313 of the present Act should be amended so as to relieve radio licensees from the confiscatory penalty to which no other business is subjected under the anti-trust laws , namely , revocation of license . Secondly , in addition to my objections to the actual provisions of the network regulations-in the White Bill , I seriously question the desirability of putting rigid regulations in this field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be flexible enough to conform to developments in the art and industry . Not that I suggest leaving unlimited power in the Commission on this subject . It seems to me that , if network broadcasting is to be regulated , the Communications Act should put the power to make regulations in the Commission , but should specify the limits within which the Commission power might be exercised . This will provide the necessary flexibility or regulatory power and at the same time will protect broadcasting stations and networks from a destructive exercise of such regulatory power by fixing minimums which the Commission can not encroach upon without Congressional approval . Conclusion The questions I have raised on specific sections of the bill lead inevitably to one big question : Shall the freedom of the air be preserved ?   Radio has many critics and I am among them . Broadcasting is far from perfect , but so , also , are the other media ? the newspapers , the magazines , the motion pictures and the theatre . So also are all human creations . This is a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions and reflections are being most shrewdly and viciously attacked by other ideologies inimical to and irreconcilable with our own . We are all well aware , after years of trial and observation , of the inherent defects in democratic procedures and most of us become annoyed from time to time with the slowness and awkwardness of their performance . But who among us is prepared to adopt in their stead the patterns and methods of Communism or Fascism ? which of us will sacrifice his hereditary freedom to secure some measure of ostensibly increased bureaucratic efficiency ? The humiliation , the enslavement , of the individual citizen , the man , for the aggrandizement of some cold impersonal concept of state is profane in the eyes of any American . It is a truism that freedom of the press is the greatest bulwark of a democracy . To an ever-increasing degree broadcasting is sharing with the press the obligation of keeping the public well informed . I submit that the freedom to speak and to listen is no less sacred to the American than the freedom to write and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being improved , freedom of the press and freedom of the air give promise of merging into one and the same freedom within the not too distant future . At this stage , the defense of freedom of the press alone is the tragically thoughtless and futile defense of a Maginot Line . It is slight incursions upon constitutional freedoms , such as those inherent in certain sections of the White Bill , that may ultimately destroy our freedoms . They are the holes in the dike through which first the trickle and then the flood of disaster flow . This is a time above all other times in our history when the people of America and Congress as the representatives of the people must zealously scrutinize any change in the law in the light of preservation of constitutional freedoms . I submit that the White Bill in its present form will not bear that scrutiny .   THE National Broadcasting Company is a nationwide network organization in the field of sound broadcasting , serving 161 independent affiliated stations , and operating six standard broadcast stations owned by the company in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and San Francisco . We also have in operation two FM or frequency modulation stations , with construction permits for four more which we intend to operate as companion stations duplicating our standard-band program service . Furthermore , we operate one television station in New York City , and a limited television network service through inter-connection with the General Electric station in Schenectady and the Philco station in Philadelphia . In addition , we shall inaugurate television service over our own station established in Washington , as well as network service between Washington and New York , on June 27 , this year . We have been granted construction permits to build and operate three additional television stations in Cleveland , Chicago and Los Angeles . By the establishment of these key television stations we hope ultimately to operate a nationwide network service of television . Experimentally , we are engaged in facsimile broadcasting , that is , the transmission by radio of printed matter direct to the home . Because of our participation in all these fields of radio service , it is our belief that a new radio law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the future services of television and facsimile .   We appreciate the opportunity to cooperate with the Chairman and the members of this Committee in the consideration of broad and comprehensive legislation for the maximum development of service to the public and for the continued growth of the industry . Two decades have passed since the enactment of the original Radio Act of 1927 . We must not only utilize the experience of these years , but we must envision the future , in order to provide for the full development of the many new services of broadcasting now at our door . Many radio broadcasters of today will become the electronic publishers of tomorrow . They will be engaged in the distribution of newsreels and motion pictures to the home by electronic means . Radio newspapers will become commonplace . Practically every form of artistic expression will become available to the people direct from studio to home through these modern methods of mass communication . Therefore , it is of the utmost importance that such new legislation as may be enacted shall allow for the great technical advances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that must find new capital to finance a vast program of expansion . We have at hand a postwar industry which , through the inauguration of local and national services , can provide for substantial employment , and make a vital contribution to the life of the American people . The Chairman of this Committee has had a long and able record in the Senate . Few are as familiar with the problems of communications . He is , therefore , particularly fitted for the present task . He has the opportunity in the formulation of new legislation to make a most valuable and lasting contribution to the future growth and development of American broadcasting . It is my hope that we of the industry will be able to supply to the Chairman and to this Committee the assistance needed for the enactment of beneficent legislation . Four years ago I appeared before the Senate Interstate Commerce Committee and testified on S. 814 , the White-Wheeler bill to amend the Communications Act . At that time I joined with the rest of the industry and urged that legislation be passed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed by the press . A free press today is one of the basic guarantees of a free society . Recognition of the same freedom for radio will place a powerful ally at the side of the press . Together they will be able to withstand any assault upon democracy . I would like to make clear that in advocating new legislation we urge that this Committee permit ample time for a thorough consideration of the many and varied factors involved . This would necessarily entail the pres-
