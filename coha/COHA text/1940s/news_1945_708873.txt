txt The release of Lieut . Gen. Jonathan M. Wainwright , the rescue of four survivors of the Doolittle raid , the liberation of many hundreds of American soldiers and civilians held in Manchuria and China , and the capture of the puppet Emperor of Manchuria , the former Henry Pu Yi , all taking place within a few days , recall the events of forty decisive months which saw the Japanese Empire reach its climax and fall into complete ruins . To leaf through the yellowing files of 1942 is to realize how near we came to being driven out of the Pacific and by what qualities , what labors and what risks our cause was redeemed . Bataan fell on April 9 , 1942 . Corregidor held out until May 6 . General Wainwright , taken prisoner with thousands of his men in the most disastrous defeat in American history , symbolized a heroism and tragedy which saddened the nation 's heart . But between , the fall of Bataan and the fall of Corregidor there occurred an event which foreshadowed the future . In that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were the beginnings of victory : the promise of the advance which reconquered Neil ) Guinea and Guadalcanal ; which retook the strategic islands , step by step ; which sent General , as he had predicted , back to the Philippines ; which crept up on Japan until the home islands could be reduced from the air , and which finally expressed its irresistible and terrible power in the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima . The Doolittle raid on Tokyo , on April 18 , 1942 , was more than a rash adventure . It was more than a bold stroke to revive drooping American spirits . It was a warning to Japan of what would surely be the end of her aggressions . It was a proclamation that though small American armies might surrender , that though American outposts might be taken , that though American warships might be treacherously destroyed , that though we were compelled to divert great strength to another theatre of war , nevertheless we would not remain on the defensive ' in the Pacific . We would attack , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we would attack with constantly growing force . Attack would save us , just as it did in fact save almost all of Doolittle 's fliers . Attack would bring us final victory . Wainwright holding out on Corregidor after all hope was gone , Doolittle 's eighty men taking off from the reeling deck of the Hornet , the Marines pushing out their lines into the jungle of Guadalcanal , all belonged to this future that has now arrived . Dead or alive , they belong to it forever . As for Henry Pu Yi , who must have felt quite firm on his puppet throne forty months ago , the Russians have him  --  the Russians who came late but effectively into the war , and whose aid to Wainwright and other American prisoners has pleasantly removed yesterday 's fears of red tape and delay . And Henry Pu Yi can blame his downfall to a large extent on men like Wainwright and Doolittle  --  heroes in one of this country 's darkest hours .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
