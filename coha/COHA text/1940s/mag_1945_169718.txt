Battle of the Hudson <P> The 45,000-ton battleship Missouri never faltered in her course when a Kamikaze hit her off Okinawa , but when New York City school children swarmed aboard , the " Mighty Mo " shuddered from stem to stern . At her Hudson River berth last week , she was boarded by 60,000 sightseeing youngsters in a single day . Manhattan 's moppets were marauders : many came armed with pliers , wrenches and screw drivers , besides their standard equipment of penknives . In a short , sharp action they : <P> Stole just about everything portable , including fire-hose nozzles . Hacked off metal and plastic name plates identifying equipment . Tried to pry up the metal plaque on the veranda deck marking the spot where the Japs ' surrender was signed . Scribbled " compositions " and scratched their initials on newly painted bulkheads . Scarred the hard enamel of the 16-in. guns so badly that the muzzles had to be raised out of reach . Set off the general alarm , which sent the cursing crew dashing to battle stations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a two-ton life raft which crashed to the deck below , miraculously injuring nobody else . But he lost a finger in the process . <P> This week , the battle-scarred Missouri retired in defeat to the Navy Yard in Brooklyn , for repairs . But one member of the crew was left behind . He had come down with the mumps.
