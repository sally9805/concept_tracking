txt A Senate judiciary subcommittee issued today a sweeping indictment of every agency of the Government involved in the seizure of Montgomery Ward &; Co. ' s Chicago facilities on April 26 . Several hours later Attorney General Francis Biddle gave out a statement declaring that the committee conclusions were " absurd " and had been reached " with a complete disregard of the legislative history and language of the War Labor Disputes Act . " The report was by a subcommittee majority consisting of Senator McCarran of Nevada and Senator Revercomb , West Virginia Republican . A dissent was filed by Senator , Arizona Democrat . The Attorney General was the chief target of the subcommittee majority , which charged that his letter to the President on April 22 advising him that he had authority to order seizure of the Ward properties contained " erroneous , misleading . irrelevant and immaterial statements . " The report also took issue with the Attorney General 's view that " the aggregate powers " of the President permitted seizure . The report also condemned the part played by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor Relations Board , the National War Labor Board and Secretary of Commerce Jesse Jones . On Table Until June 12 The subcommittee report recommended that the full Judiciary Committee hold hearings on proposed legislative recommendations . The committee received the report today and , on motion of Senator Hatch , Democrat , of New Mexico , laid it on the table until June 12 . The committee invited all interested parties to file briefs , protests or applications for hearings and announced that it would decide June 19 on any further action . Senator declared that the subcommittee had not made " the kind of investigation calculated to get the facts required for a full report . " The subcommittee , he asserted , had denied to the interested parties an opportunity to be heard and had based its report solely on documentary evidence , which might not be complete , " and upon the conclusions of investigators , whose testimony is necessarily hearsay and second or third hand . " The subcommittee majority charged that Mr. Biddle 's letter to the President " tended to confuse rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recited facts " which are unconfirmed by the records of the Federal departments and agencies concerned with the labor controversy but also contains conclusions which are inconsistent with and unsubstantiated by the facts which he recites . " The subcommittee considered " particularly unwarranted and untenable the conclusion that the dispute between the company and the union could not be settled promptly and peacefully without resort to executive order . " Biddle " Misadvice " Charged Mr. Biddle was also charged with having " misadvised " the President when he said that the President had authority to issue his executive order " under Section 3 of the War Labor Disputes Act " and he was said to have been " in error " when he held that the President had an " aggregate of powers , " derived from the Constitution and various laws , to take possession of the mail-order house . Mr. Biddle in his statement made public a sharp exchange of views with Senator McCarran . It was revealed that the Attorney General sent a letter to the committee chairman yesterday asking for an opportunity to appear before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the committee did not contain all the facts necessary to an understanding of the case . Senator McCarran replied that his committee wished to reach its conclusions " upon the basis of facts rather than opinion " and would try to apply the law to such facts " unswayed by emotional argument . " He declined " with thanks " Mr. Biddle 's offer to appear , but " with full realization that your letter " may have been " successful in laying a foundation for an attack upon the subcommittee 's report . " Fairness Is Challenged Mr. Biddle retorted tonight that Senator McCarran " apparently believes that it is fair to condemn my action and the action of the President and the Secretary of Commerce , the chairman of the War Labor Board and of the National Labor Relations Board without the opportunity of being heard . " He concurred with the dissent of Senator and , referring to the statement by Senator McCarran of the committee 's desire to exclude opinions and stick to facts , said that the Nevada Senator " then gives his opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decision by the fall Judiciary Committee today to invite briefs and protests and possible hearings , and complimented the committee for its " great tradition of wisdom and fairness . " He declared that he was heartened to know that it " has not approved the star chamber methods adopted by two members of the committee . " Noting that the majority subcommittee report contained " a summary of chronological statement of facts , " the Attorney General said this was " apparently based on hearsay information gathered by one of the subcommittee 's agents from conversations held in Chicago and reported as hearsay to members of the subcommittee . " Concerning Court Decisions Mr.-Biddle said that the subcommittee 's discussion of the law contained but a single case in the United States District Court on the question whether the WLB has a right to enforce its orders in court . " The committee neglects to state , " he added , " that the judgment is now on appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District ; and refrains from mentioning decisions of three other United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The subcommittee , according to Mr. Biddle , cited no cases in support of its contention that the President lacked power to act in the Montgomery Ward case , making no reference to Supreme Court cases which clearly recognized such powers , " all of which were referred to in a copy of my brief used in the Montgomery Ward proceedings and filed with the subcommittee . " The subcommittee , he declared , also overlooked a decision of the United States District Court for the western district of Kentucky , handed down May 9 in the case of Ken Rad Tube and Lamp Corporation vs . Badeau . In that case , continued Mr. Biddle , the court held that , irrespective of the War Labor Disputes Act , the President had power under the Constitution to take possession of the plant and operate it . In its criticism of the various agencies the subcommittee majority declared that the Conciliation Service " apparently has no facts in its files " to justify its finding that the 1942 controversy between the union and the company . might have interrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . " Nor did the Conciliation Service , it was asserted , make any investigation upon which to base its certification of the 1943 dispute to the NWLB . The report charged further that the NWLB had failed to disclose facts to , support its ruling of 1942 that the dispute of that year might interrupt war activities . The report alleged that the NWLB 's assumption of jurisdiction of the Montgomery Ward case Jan. 13 , 1944 , was " inconsistent " with the action of its Chicago regional board on April 15 , 1944 , in declining to exercise jurisdiction over a labor dispute involving Sears , Roebuck &; Co. at Minneapolis . In the latter case , it was pointed out , jurisdiction was not taken on the ground that Sears Roebuck was not engaged in war production and the dispute rightly belonged to the NLRB . WLB Interpretation Assailed The report asserted that the NWLB had applied a " distorted and unwarranted interpretation " of the War Labor Disputes Act when , on Jan. 13 , 1944 , it ordered re-established for thirty days an expired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wholesale and Deparment Store Employes of America , CIO , as the bargaining agency in that period , the NWLB , it was alleged , exercised " powers given exclusively to the NLRB by the National Labor Relations Act . " The WLB should have sought a Federal Court order to enforce its directive of Jan. 13 , according to the report , and failure to do so was " evidence of the board 's reluctance to have its orders reviewed by the courts . " Condemning the NLRB for " dilatory tactics in a matter of great emergency , " the report said the union had filed a petition for certification on Feb. 14 , 1944 , and it was not only May 2 , 1944 , after the Government had seized the Chicago facilities , that the board decided to order an election . Attitude in Union Criticized The report contended that , " after having issued the order of Jan. 13 , 1944 , the NLRB failed to ' provide for terms and conditions . . . which shall be fair and equitable to employer and employe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on April 5 , 1944 , the board excused the union from pressing its petition for an election with the NLRB until such time as the company complied with the board 's previous order of Jan. 13 , 1944 . " " The WLB did not note , " the report added , " that the union also failed to follow the board 's directive order of Jan. 13 , 1944 , in that the union did not file its petition with the NLRB within the time limit prescribed by the NWLB . " Secretary Jones was criticized for calling on the Army to take over the Montgomery Ward property , the report saying that " such a step should have been taken only as a last resort . " That it was not the last resort was shown , the report added , by the fact that on April 27 , 1944 , the Government began a court suit to compel compliance with the executive order . Recommendations Offered The subcommittee made three recommendations as follows : 1 . That hearings be held to determine whether Congress should amend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1940 to provide for the enforcement of WLB orders by Federal Court acttion ; whether the law should be amended to provide for judicial reviews of orders of the WLB or whether new legislation should be passed to provide a priority for judicial processes and decisions involving appeals from or enforcement of WLB orders . 2 . That every Government department or agency concerned with labor relations " should meticulously avoid merely pro forma findings and should make certain in every case that there are in its records facts to support every finding and that each order is based on law . " 3 . That future Executive orders of the President contain " specific citations by number " of all sections of the Constitution and the laws of Congress upon which the President relies for his authority to issue the order . In his dissent , Senator said that the subcommittee had had only a few meetings , that those were executive sessions with nothing reduced to writing , that investigators ' reports were made orally and that the proposed report was submitted to members of the committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The subcommittee acted under Senate Resolution 252 authorizing it to investigate the Constitutional or statutory authority upon which any Executive order issued by the President since March , 1933 , was based . Senator contended that the subcommittee should have acted in accordance with a resolution by Senator Byrd of Virginia calling for an investigation of the seizure of Montgomery Ward &; Co . Senator declared that the Senate had indicated it wanted all the facts in the case . " The determination of the facts would have required , of course , a complete investigation of all the records of the various agencies mentioned in the proposed report , " he continued . " These records , however , are not the only source of relevant information . It seems to me that the questions for the committee to determine are whether all the facts justify the seizure ; and whether the President had the authority to issue the Executive Order ; and not merely the state of the records of the various Govern , ment agencies concerned . " Therefore , from that point of view , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts really were . " Senator expressed the view also that Sewell Avery , chairman of Montgomery Ward , should have been permitted to explain " why he insisted upon being carried from the plant by force and ' why he did not submit to the Executive Order as the officials of all other plants have , and pro-1 tect his rights in court . " Today 's developments in the case included an announcement by , the War Labor Board that it was 1 inviting Montgomery Ward and ' the United Retail , Wholesale and Department Store Employes of America and the company to a show cause hearing here Wednesday to explain why the terms of the expired union agreement shall not be continued pending negotiation of a new agreement . In labor circles it was predicted that this would herald a new showdown between the WLB and the mail order house . A second seizure of the company property , this time by the War Department , if the mail order house again defies the Labor Board , is regarded as likely . In comment on the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices of the NWLB that Chairman William H. Davis , testifying Monday before the House committee investigating the Montgomery Ward case , said that the board did not wish to have authority to go into court to enforce its orders , but preferred to turn over enforcement " to the cop . " It was also said that the subcommittee report contained a conclusion that " certification of a particular bargaining agency by the NLRB is presumed in law to continue valid and binding until a contrary decision is made by the NLRB . " The WLB , it was stated , agreed and had applied this presumption to the Ward case . Replying to the report 's reference to the case of Sears Roebuck , WLB attaches declared that the issue was alleged refusal to bargain and had nothing to do with the type of business done by the company . A refusal to bargain , it was added , was a matter for action by the NLRB and that was why the Chicago regional WLB had refused to take jurisdiction .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
