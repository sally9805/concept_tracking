It was ten minutes later in the sedate sanctuary of the president of the Miners National that the Marcus Harris transfer ca through . The identification was not difficult  --  his press ager union card , his card of membership to The Lambs were almost sufficient . He had in his pocket his last bill at the Beverly Wilshire . The clinching proof , however , was the several receipts from undertakerJames Orloff . " Good old Jimmy Orloff ! " Dunnigan even found himself repeating . Bill Dunnigan took five thousand of his credit in " folding money "  --  not that he folded it , for the greater part was placed in a long , heavy envelope . Four five-hundred-dollar bills , twenty " centuries , " the remaining thousand in fifties and smaller denominations . " I 'd like nine ones and a dollar in change , " he said with a broad smile . " I 'm all out of silver . " The bank president little knew how entirely " out " was his new and apparently wealthy client ! The remaining fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bankbook and a pocket checkbook . " Now please direct me to the nearest garage . I must have a car quick ! " he asked the president who had personally supervised these transactions . Even the great Miners National was impressed by a client to whom twenty thousand dollars was transferred from one of the most important of New York City banks . " There 's a garage right off the Square . One of our clerks will go with you , " said this official . " Opening a business in Coaltown , Mr. Dunnigan ? That seems to be the center of activity today ! " And then , before Mr. Dunnigan could answer , the name out of the front page story in his breakfast-table newspaper struck home . " Of course ! You 're the Mr. Dunnigan the paper speaks of in connection with this funeral ! A theater man , I take it . " The bank president had nearly said , " The wealthy Mr. Dunnigan . " How fortunate this revered word had not slipped out ! In his banking circles one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words to the holder thereof . Mr. Dunnigan sensed this sudden attitude of adoration although the president remainedseated in his chair . And he wondered if this same gentleman would have staked him to a cup of coffee half an hour before ! " I have sure opened a business in Coaltown ! " he smiled . " ButP201it wo n't be operating if I do n't get back by twelve noon ! " He had again looked at his watch . Eleven-thirty already ! like to talk with you when you have more leisure , " said the president . " There is room in Nanticoke for a first-class motionpicturetheater , and some of us were thinking " " I 'll be seeing you again and thanks for your kindness , " said Bill , " but I 'm already planning to back a Quick Lunch here in Nanti-coke ! " " A Quick Lunch ! " said the president in complete mystification . " Yes , " said Mr. Dunnigan , " Great future in that business ! Two cups of coffee , you know ! " and he rushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to his complete sanity . However , thought the bank president , these millionaires were often eccentric ! He had known a wealthy mine owner who played and collected banjos ! The clerk assigned to pilot Mr. Dunnigan to the garage reported another erratic action . The new twenty-thousand-dollar depositor stopped briefly opposite the Nanticoke Loan Company and doffed his hat elaborately to that lowly and unlovely institution . At the garage their best Packard car was selected and engaged in record time . Engaged with a driver for a week ; paid for in advance with no argument as to the price ! " On to Coaltown ! " commanded its new master , but there was a stop for a few moments at the telegraph office to dispatch another wire to Marcus Harris . Dunnigan had written it out on the back of a check while waiting for the Packard to be fueled . " Thanks Marcus boss " ( it read ) " Money joyfully in hand stop I apologize stop That guy Maecenas was a tinhorn piker compared to you exclamation point Love and plenty kisses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note through the small high window . " Get it off quick  --  keep the change  --  keep mum ! " he tried . " I 'll probably be doing more business with you . No information to any newspaper reporters  --  understand ? " " You can count on me , Mr. Dunnigan ! " replied the operator . He also had acquired a lift of spirit . He was intending to give up a correspondence course in radio and electronics . He decided then and there to keep on with it . The world was a grand place to be in after all ! That nine dollar tip would pay for a month of those lessons . The flame of courage that Bill Dunnigan had started , Father Paul had started , Olga Treskovna had started , was spreadinginto unknown lives . The Packard raced through the stark loveliness of the Wyoming Valley hills . They were no longer lonely and foreboding to WilliamDunnigan . They were no longer " damned hills . " They were beautiful , magnificent , superb , heartwarming ! All the adjectives he had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One must believe in God just to look at them ! Even without a sunset flaming behind them . The sun was now overhead and every green mountain shone like a deep , rich emerald . Halfway back , when they were at the very summit of a long , steep climb in the roadway and could look out over the valley for miles , he felt a slender hand touching his , a hand that then clasped his and held it tightly . He turned and there she seemed to be  --  her face radiant , her lips parted in that seductive curve he remembered so vividly from their Christmas Eve together . " I 'm depending on you , Bill , " she seemed to say . " I guess I 've always depended on you ! " " And I 'm depending on you , my darling , " said Bill Dunnigan . " Do n't ever leave me for long ! Come to me whenever you can ! " " I told you I 'd be with you always . It 's you and me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone as quickly as she came . The Packard was plunging down the last hill into Coaltown . As they whirled past the Breaker , grumbling and roaring and fuming under the lashing of the bells , Bill waved a gay salute . " Hi-ya ! Old Bozo ! " he cried , " Pull up your socks and pull in your stomach for you 're going to get a punch right in the solar plexus ! A twenty-thousand-dollar punch that you wo n't forget ! " He pointed out the brick parish house of St. Leo and the car pulled up in front of it . It seemed to Dunnigan he was not steppingdown from a motorcar . He was leaping off a great black battle charger  --  like Richard the Lion Hearted or was it General Sheridan or Paul Revere ! He was n't quite sure  --  his history was a bit confused  --  anyway , he had galloped madly over the hills and the fight was saved  --  for it still lacked two minutes of being noon by the Follies watch . It was high time he arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was just emerging from the St. Leo parish house doorway . Father Spinsky had also noted the time . With tight lips he was on his way to stop the ringing of the bells , since the promised businessarrangement had not been fulfilled . FATHER SPINSKY of St. Leo 's was not an evilman . Judged by worldly standards he was in many ways an admirablepersonality , since he had for fifteen years conducted the business of his parish with the strictest integrity and a considerable success . He owed no one ; he paid all bills promptly ( always taking advantage of a discount therefor ) ; he had accumulated a sizable reserve . He had accomplished this by not hesitating to speak from his pulpit of financial needs , by telling his congregation that if they did not meet these needs they were in danger of the displeasure of the Almighty . He also stressed the spiritual value of liberal contributionsto collections and the box at the door . Nor did he overlook the suggestion that when death came , the good Christian would not lessen his claim to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this " greed , " as Bill Dunnigan had thought it , was not for himself . It was for his church . But by " church " Father Spinsky did not mean that great spiritual structure of charity , solace , forgiveness , inspiration , that is the Church in the heart of the Ages . He meant the actual edifice of St. Leo 's over which he presided  --  a tall , plain brick building of no particular architectural design , wide enough to boast of two great doorways across its facade , tall enough to have stained-glass windows of three-story height along its sides . So his religion had hardened into a shell of brick and mortar  --  into a marble altar as large and line as any in the near-by large cities , into an organ the most expensivefor miles around , into the great metal bell that was the loudest and deepest in that vicinity and which hung in a square brick tower rising at one side of his basilica.  | The near-by ramshackle wooden structure of St. Michael 's was a source of constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , removed , as one removed a dead limb from a tree . He had hoped it would be closed when its elderly , easy-going priest who had been there for years passed on to his reward . But then came young Father Paul with absurd ideas of resuscitation  --  ideasabout " helping the town . " Worse , he attempted to enact these ideas without consulting Father Spinsky , who , although he had no authority over other Coaltown churches , felt that as the pastor of the largest and richest church he should be conferred with . And now this unworthy and superfluous and inadequate Church of St. Michael was the center of an intense and profitable interest not only from the town but from all the surrounding countryside ! When Father Paul had brought Dunnigan to him , Father Spinsky had thought of the four-day bell ringing as the whim of some obscure person . Let them have their whim if they had the money to pay for it ! It would bring in some extra revenue which St. Leo 's could well use . But he quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscure , " was , in fact , identified with a great industry whose personages lent themselves flamboyantly to an appeal to the popular imagination . And the bell-ringing fee was going to be only a part of the financial returns . Perhaps only a minor part . His own St. Leo 's should be the center of any such publicity and acclaim . And revenue . Certainly it was a most distressing twist of fortune that all this should go to the down-and-out St. Michael 's ! And before it was over , Father Paul would make a bungling mess of the whole affair ! At any rate , in another five minutes St. Michael 's would be the only Coaltown bell to continue its ringing . The payment deadline had been reached . And an unsecured arrears of one hundred dollarshad to be collected ! There was a screeching of brakes at his curb . Leaping at him was the tall fellow who had on foot arranged for the bells , the fellow he had watched climb aboard a Nanticoke bus after their interview that morning , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom Father Spinsky had half expected never to sec again . Is there such a thing as transference of a mental attitude , or did Dunnigan unconsciously carry out his own imaginings in descend/ing from the Packard ? For it seemed to Father Spinsky also , for one brief second as he looked , that the tall man was getting off a horse ! But he had distinctly heard the noise of brakes and it was surely a large , strange motorcar at his curb . " I 'm just under the wire , I know ! " exclaimed Dunnigan as he strode toward the staring St. Leo pastor , " but I had to breeze from Nanticoke , and my driver says they enforce a forty-mile-an-hour speed law in Pennsylvania ! If we can go inside , Father , I think we can settle all bets . " Father Spinsky withdrew his eyes from the curb and looked at his watch . It was one minute to twelve noon . He was a just man if not a lovable one . He led the way back into the parish house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked doubtfully as they moved back up the walk . " Sure did ! Thought you saw me ! Hired it in Nanticoke where I had some banking business , " replied Dunnigan . And he wonderedjust what Father Spinsky meant by such a question . Perhaps he had made a rather agile leap to the curb , and if by any chance the priest were near-sighted " Great gallop it was over your high hills ! " he added with a gesture of tugging at the reins . It amused Dunnigan hugely in his present elated mood to act just a little before this meticulous cleric . He noted that Father Spinsky took another quick glance toward the street curb . Inside his office the priest felt on solid ground . Here there would be no optical illusions , for it was a solid room with a huge solid desk , a long solid table and solid chairs . Behind the desk were two tall , oak letter files ; and a large safe with " Parish of St. Leo " painted on its front stood solidly by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but had taken little notice of his surroundings . Now he observed for the first time a daily calendar with large numerals on the wall above this safe . It advertised the Miners National Bank . He and Father Spinsky were brother depositors ! " Be seated , sir , " said Father Spinsky , as he lowered himself into his desk chair . Again he looked at his watch . The gesture indi-i ated without further words what Mr. Dunnigan was expected to produce . But in looking downward , Father Spinsky noticed for the firstp206time Bill Dunnigan 's spats . Their virgin white was now a dull grey  --  a steel grey . And they somehow reminded the priest of the greaves on medieval armor . He had made a journey to New York two weeks before and spent an afternoon at the Metropolitan Museum . The armor gallery had fascinated him . The garb of fighting men . Strength . That was Father Spinsky 's religion . Dunnigan , " heeled " ( as he would have called it ) with the twenty thousand bucks from Marcus Harris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having duly seated himself , and in so doing drawing up his trouser legs so that his spats were well exposed , the press agent was speaking . " I came as quickly as I could , for I knew how worried you would be about your obligations to your colleagues . " He took from his pocket the long , thick , manila envelope and snapped off the rubberband around it . Father Spinsky transferred his gaze from the spats and watched with equal fascination the opening of the envelope . Free of the contracting influence of the rubber band , it sprang wide apart and seemed to contain enough large bills in good U. S. currency to cover the semi-weekly pay roll of the mines ! A number of **30;1572;TOOLONG were plainly visible . It looked to Father Spinsky as if the whole envelope were stuffed with such bills . Dunnigan , however , managed to find one of a smaller denomination  --  ahumble hundred-dollar note . He placed it on Father Spinsky 's desk . Money did not seem out of place on that desk . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without security I now pay you , " he said . " Since it is twelve noon  --  maybe a minute or two after that  --  we start again from scratch . " You told me that from noon today the price went up to twentyfivebucks an hour . That seems a little steep , but it 's O. K. I ant instructed to be generous . And I realize you 'll have to hire extra bell ringers , and all that , to go on for three more days . I want a first-class job and nobody down with bell ringers ' cramp ! " It 's now Tuesday noon . We 'll have the funeral on Friday . Say we ring the bells till six o'clock Friday evening . Tuesday noon till Friday noon is seventy-two hours . From noon that day till six is six hours more . Total , seventy-eight hours . At twenty-five bucks an hour that makes one thousand nine hundred and fifty iron men . I 'll pay each church direct , if you do n't mind . Keeps my accounts straight  |p207that  way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or will acheck on the Miners National of Nanticoke , which I see you also patronize , meet your requirements ? " He now dramatically drew from his pocket the new checkbook and flipped it open . Dunnigan 's rapid mathematical calculations of the hours and the payment therefor had taken both his breath and that of Father Spinsky . Bill hoped he had n't made a mistake in his figuring ! Father Spinsky , viewing resources so adequate and so lavishly tobe dispersed , felt more keenly than ever the terrible mistake of this funeral 's taking place anywhere but from his own St. Leo 's . He sucked a deep breath through tight lips and forced a smile . He would make one more desperate try . " If you will look at my Church of St. Leo , " he said , leaning forward , " I think you will realize how much better suited it will be to your purpose . " " I will gladly look at your Church of St. Leo when I have the time , " said Bill gaily , " but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid with Saint Michael the Scrapper . That lad in the sword and armor has a run-of-the-play contract with me . I only just met him at Father Paul 's , but we became pals right off , if I may say so without offence , Reverend . We saw eye to eye pronto ! Saint Michael has sort of had a raw deal around here , but he 's going to get a break from now on or I 'll eat my hat ! And his iron one ! Which shall it be , Father , cash or check , for I mustgallop along . The other three churches  --  I do n't want them to worry or stop ringing their bells ! " Father Spinsky sighed deeply and uneasily . He had somehow known it would be of no avail . And his eyes had again been drawn to the steel-grey spats of his visitor . Why should they remind himof the armor room of the Metropolitan Museum of Art , and also of something else  --  he could n't quite determine what it was ? " Your check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " hesaid at last . " I have already sent your savings bankbook for collection , so I can not give it back to you . " " That 's O. K. also , " said Bill . " O. K. and double O. K. " he added with a laugh . " I never doubted the authenticity of that book , " said Father Spinsky quickly.  | " I did n't mean that you did ! " smiled Bill Dunnigan , " And what I do mean we 'll skip . Little personal matter . I only hope your big church does n't burn down or something ! From what you say it would make quite a blaze ! And I need your bell in my choir . Some basso profundo , that bell ! " And he cocked his head and listened for a moment . " Reminds me of my old friend De Wolf Hopper , Well , here 's your check  --  " Bill 's fountain pen had been busy "  --  it will also serve as a receipt . I 've written across it ' paymentin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six P.M. Friday . ' So do n't you dare change its voice ! " Dunnigan arose . " I wo n't ask for a refund , however , if anything happens to you . It wo n't be your fault . Now good day , Father , and no bad luck to you ! " Bill Dunnigan took up his checkbook , his envelope of currency , and his black derby . The first two ( having re-snapped the rubber around the currency ) he jammed into his inside breast coat pocket ; and the hat he placed on his head at its most jaunty angle as he made an almost running exit . Father Spinsky , Dunnigan 's check still in his hand , moved to his front window and watched this athletic apparition leap down his walk and into the waiting Packard , which immediately lunged forward . Again the priest had the sensation that he was watching a figure dash away on horseback ! THE PASTOR of St. Leo 's knew now the other thing that those greave-like spats had reminded him of . The only Saint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! In his years of opposition to St. Michael 's Church in Coaltown , he had thought of it only as a shabby , superfluous building , handled by inefficacious clerics . Its name , as such , did not enter into his antagonism . It might have been St. Anyone or St. Anything.  |p209Churches  , had to have some name . St. Michael 's external decrepitudeand debts ( which everyone knew about ) and internal uselessness ( as Father Spinsky believed ) would have been equally obnoxiousto him under any name ! But now an entirely new and alarming idea came into his consciousness . It had commenced to form while Dunnigan was speaking . Suppose it was not that shabby building he had been fighting , but the particular Saint for which the church was named ? Saint Michael himself ! The Captain of the Army of God ! Suppose  --  at last aroused  --  Saint Michael himself were taking a hand ! Sup-poseFather Spinsky wiped his brow . The idea was ridiculous , but he could not drive those silly , greave-like spats from his mind . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his Lives of the Saints . He remembered . September was Saint Michael 's month . It was almost September ! The First Warrior of Heaven had made numerous appearances on this earth . He it was who had spoken to Moses on Mt . Sinai -- delivered to him the Tables of The Law . He it was who had twice rescued the Apostle Peter from prison , smiting the chains from his hands and feet . Moreover , it would seem he was especially zealous in matters concerning his churches . In Italy he had come to the Bishop of Siponto and ordered a church built in a certain cavern . In France he had come to Saint Authbert , Bishop of Avranches , and the resulthad been the erection of that soaring pile that is one of the monuments of the ages , Mont St. Michel . At Colosse in the suburbs f Constantinople Father Spinsky snapped to his volume . This was America and he Twentieth Century . He held in his hand a check signed William Dunnigan . " William Dunnigan was a slangy , rapid liking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight not even be worth the paper it was printed on . A convincing , kable chap , but then most confidence men were convincing and kable ! Father Spinsky moved to his telephone , asked for theNaniticoke number that was the Miners National and was quickly ! king with his friend , its president . " I have a check for one thousand nine hundred and fifty dollarsp120signed by a William Dunnigan . Is it good ? " he asked , having made himself known . " If the signature is Mr. Dunnigan 's , it 's as good as cash in hand , " replied the president . " He made it out in my presence . A tall man in a light plaid suit and a black derby . Talks rapidly and wears greaves  --  I mean spats  --  " said Father Spinsky . " That is undoubtedly the gentleman , " said the president . " What do you know about him ? " asked Father Spinsky . " All we need to know . Connected with powerful interests . Wealthy . He has received a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Identified with motion pictures , according to the newspapers . " " This morning I also mailed for collection a savings bankbook on Brooklyn , New York , which this man yesterday assigned to me as security . The amount was five hundred dollars which I would not care to lose as I am responsible to  --  " " Five hundred dollars ! " broke in the Nanticoke bank president . Sometimes even he became a little impatient with his friend Father Spinsky 's pettiness and suspicion and preciseness in matters financial . Since he was talking to a member of the clergy and a customer of many years ' standing , he divulged more than he would have ordinarily . " Listen , Father Spinsky , this gentleman has a credit of fifteen thousand dollars with us , and that after withdrawing five thousand dollars in cash . And we have just received another wire from his New York bank that we are to extend to him any additional credits he may desire . What are you doing holding up such a man for a **32;1604;TOOLONG account ! He should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We could use outside capital . If Coaltown is n't interested , we in Nanticoke certainly are ! " " Thank you . Good-by , " said Father Spinsky and hung up . What  --  indeed had he been doing ? Like undertaker Orloff 's , his usually cast-iron stomach felt a dull pain . The vision of the shin greaves returned  --  and scraps of the conversation . " Great gallop it was over your high hills ! " " Saint Michael the Scrapper ! " " He 's had a raw deal around here , but he 's going to get a break ! " Could it be  --  could it possibly bep211And what was the meaning of the statement , " I only hope your big church does n't burn down ! " " I wo n't ask a refund if anything happens to you ! " Father Spinsky looked anxiously at his church through the side windows of his office . It was still there , of course . It was not in flames . It had not crumbled . Anyway , it was fully insured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insurance policies , however , could not restore in a day fifteen years of labor and devotion . He sat himself at his desk . For the first time he could remember he was not entirely satisfied with that self . For the first time a shadowy fear gnawed at his mind . For the first time his heart was troubled . His supreme confidence in his every action was badly shaken . There had been a small matter that very morning that now assumedgigantic proportions , just as his attitude regarding the small matter of the savings bankbook was becoming a tragedy . Father Paul at St. Michael 's was out of shrine candles . Father Paul had hesitatingly asked the loan of some , even offered to pay for them , and had been curtly refused . Come to think of it , the request had been phrased , " Could you  --  would you lend Saint Michael a few candles to tide me over ? " Lend Saint Michael . It had given Father Spinsky an unholy joy to say , " No . I have no candles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in plenty in his well-stocked storeroom . A shipment had arrived only the week before . And no matter what money Father Paul might have now , it would be several days before candles could be obtained from the supply houses in Philadelphia or New York . Unless  --  unless the presence of Saint Michael himself could miraculously turn dollars into shrine candles on the spot ! Ile , Father Spinsky , had been given his chance to supply this need . Perhaps it was an opportunity of atonement for many past slights  --  he remembered how , without saying a word but by a ges-t tire , he had indicated to the salesman of one of these supply houses the uselessness of extending further credit to Father Paul . He remembered another time - These were no longer pleasurable memories . They were a little terrifying ! Father Spinsky called out to his assistant whom he had heard come in . " There are ten gross of shrine candles that arrived last week inp212our storeroom . Father Paul up at St. Michael 's has run out of them . Put as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rush them there at once . Tell Father Paul to let me know if he runs short again . " The assistant wondered if he had heard rightly ! For that very morning , on Father Spinsky 's return from the Dunnigan interview at the Wyoming Hotel , he had listened to a tirade against St. Michael 's Church and Father Paul 's absurd request for a loan of shrine candles ! " Do I understand  --  ? " he commenced . " You understand exactly what I said ! " thundered Father Spinsky with a gesture of great impatience . " Be quick about it ! There 's no time to lose ! Say they are a present from Saint Leo to Saint Michael the Scrapper . " " Saint Michael the What ! " " No matter . Rush the candles there ! " The dazed assistant hurried off on his surprising errand . Father Spinsky again wiped his forehead and drew the handkerchiefaround inside his Roman collar . It was a shock to be jolted out of the complacency of a lifetime . He arose and paced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and donned a cassock which hung in the closet at one end of the room . He stepped out of his doorway and entered his Church of St. Leo . There , at any rate , his soul would have peace . There he could collect his thoughts . All within its sacred doors was right and strong and holy . He had made no mistakes about his church . God , himself , was there . But inside , and standing by the marble holy-water font near the entrance , he had the most disturbing shock of a disturbing noon hour . God was not there ! At least , so it seemed to the perturbed mind of Father Spinsky . Or if there ( for the small red light was still burning before the tabernacle containing- the Eucharist ) , God had turned his back on all that this church contained . Father Spinsky 's massive , white-marble altar rose imposingly at the far end . But no golden-hallowed Presence was beside it . Instead , the priest could see the obsequious , frock-coated salesman of the Philadelphia supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell you , Father Spinsky , you will have the most expensive altar in that part of Pennsylvania . We have just erected one in St. Mary 's at Reading that is not nearly as magnificent . And ourp213price includes all transportation charges and erection in Coaltown . You 'll have something to brag about ! " And how many sermons of fear had he preached to obtain the money to buy it ! The great organ , now silent , was in the choir loft above him  --  some of its tall , gilded pipes were visible where their rows extended : long the side walls . But no trumpeting Angels were near them . Instead , he saw the calculating face of the Cleveland mineowner , whom he had persuaded to meet that organ 's cost , and heard his question : " You are sure that if I do this , it will tend to prevent strikes  --  will make these ungrateful miners feel that their wages are adequate  --  that their employer is interested in their good ? " The great cone of a gold baptismal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grocer whose money paid for it to change his will at the last minute in Father Spinsky 's presence . He could see the man 's terror-drawn face now , and could hear himself promising reward for this " generosity . " Each costly shrine , each stain-glassed window had some similar memory . Fear , self-interest , hope of reward . Nothing given in a fervor of love . St. Leo 's suddenly became a museum of expensive objects gathered by a selfish , unscrupulous collector  --  not a sanctuary of hope and prayer and consolation . There was sincere pain in Father Spinsky 's eyes . He had not meant to do any wrong . He had not , in every case , been entirely w Tong . Fear and self-interest were the only emotions that would move certain people . But he had come to treat everyone that way , to distrust all men , to forget that great things could also be accomplishedby love , by friendship , by understanding . He had pretty thoroughly eliminated all the basic teachings of Christ Jesus ! There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statue f Saint Joseph , repaired where an arm had been broken . He was intending to throw it out and replace it with a new and larger tatue . At least this shrine had no disturbing memories  --  it was there when he had taken over the church . It probably had been In ought from Poland . Father Spinsky moved to this shrine . One candle was burning before it . He took a wax taper and it three other candles . And he deposited the three dimes that was in St. Leo 's ) the candle charge . One candle he lit to Saint Michael the Archangel , one to the dead girl , Olga Trocki , and one to her father for whom his bell was also tolling  --  the late Stanislaus Trocki . He knelt before this shrine . He asked a simple forgiveness of Saint Michael . For the girl Olga Trocki , whom he did not remember except that he had once seen her assisting her staggering father to their home , he said the usual prayer for the dead . Stanislaus Trocki he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of the town sometimes became intoxicated . Women also . And exhibited themselves in public in this condition . But none so consistently , so openly as the late Stan Trocki . Father Spinsky had no sympathy for such human frailty . And his casual annoyance as a citizen on seeing this gentleman negotiating his homeward journeys from the round of saloons on payday , became a very personal and indignant anger when one morning he had stumbled over Mr. Trocki asleep in a drunken stupor on the very steps of St. Leo 's Church ! Father Spinsky had telephoned the sheriff , and presently citizen Trocki ( still unconscious ) was loaded into that official 's car and ' taken to the jail in Wanamee . Coaltown had no jail . Not wanting to appear in the disgusting matter , Father Spinsky ensured that his name was not brought up , and the girl never knew who had caused her father 's only arrest and the twenty-five-dollar fine that it took her Breaker earnings of a month to pay . Father Spinsky had himself forgotten it till now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask Saint Joseph to intercede for the sins of Stanislaus Trocki whose soul was without doubt being grilled in Purgatory . Father Spinsky did not proceed with this petition . A windfall of over two thousand dollars had just come to St. Leo 's partly because of this man . And he , Father Spinsky , had once refused him mere assistance  --  shelter  --  the simplest of Christian ministration . He could have carried the poor fellow inside his parish house . He could have sent for the girl . What would the Master , Christ , have done in a similar instance ? And there was another stabbing thought . " In as much as yo have done it unto the least of these , you have done it unto me . " Father Spinsky arose and went slowly and wearily to his own great altar . High above it , above the top of the marble spires of thep215altar , was a life-sized figure of the Christ nailed to a cross . It , too , was an inheritance of the church as he found it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasped hard the rail of his altar , so hard that the knuckles showed white through the heavy skin . He stood outside the sanctuary . He looked up at the suffering figure of the Christ . His own face was drawn . He repeated no Latin monolog  --  no one of the set phrases that he knew so well . He said very simply : " Oh God  --  forgive me . Forgive me ! " He closed his eyes and stood there silently for awhile . He could not even pray . The cruel enormity of countless little things that he had done all his life paraded before his mind . How could he expect the compassionate Son of God to stand beside him ? Was he destined to go on preaching sermons , repeating holy words in a place from which God had seemed to withdraw his approbation . Could he go on doing this ? He opened his eyes at last . He turned , still gripping hard the altar rail , to look again at the building his pride and sin had desecrated . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  afraid he would only meet with the same coldness that had reigned in his own heart . His eyes were drawn toward the humble altar by the door . The three candles that he had lit before Saint Joseph were burning brightly , making a warm glow about the whole shrine . They were sending out a tiny glow that grew to an aureola andemed to be embracing the whole edifice , seeking to re-sanctifyat edifice , to change it from a museum back to a Church of God nce more . Father Spinsky took long , deep breaths as if to saturate his whole Bing with the light from his three candles . He did not feel that e was forgiven . But he felt that his church was again a holy place , d that he could start again from that humble altar , and by deeds , t words , merit the grace that should belong to the vicar of a Church . These plans for the town that Father Paul had tried to carry out . Some of them were good plans . Maybe they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put himself at Father Paul 's serve . If both parishes worked together , his and St. Michael 's , a great al could be accomplished.  | And was there anything more that he could do immediately for St. Michael 's ? Besides candles he remembered that he also had some extra candle racks . Father Paul could use these if his church was to be crowded the next few days . He could even lend some racks from the front of his own shrines . He would do that before Father Paul 's next Mass . He would announce Father Paul 's early Mass from his own pulpit that evening , when he held a regular service . And he must locate still more candles . If means were provided , St. Michael 's could , by this funeral , get well on its financial feet . Father Spinsky squared his shoulders , but his head was bowed . Nevertheless , lie walked from St. Leo 's with the quick step of a younger man . In the parish house his sister had his dinner ready and waiting . Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did the man at the hotel come through ? " Mary Spinsk asked bluntly as they sat at the well-laden table . The words " come through " grated harshly on Father Spinsky He was about to utter a severe reproof when he remembered tha she was only quoting his own terminology . He had turned no only his church but his very household into a place of distrust an greed . Looking at his sister , he realized it would be easier t re-sanctify the church ! " The gentleman met his account promptly , " he answered . " He is evidently a man of his word . " " And the funeral remains at St. Michael 's ? " persisted Ma Spinsky , " It remains there  --  as it should , " said Father Spinsky with some emphasis . Mary Spinsky looked at her brother , but his set face gazed dow upon his plate . He added nothing to this surprising qualification of his statement . " Well , at least you can now throw out that old St. Joseph shrine and buy the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph shrine will remain exactly as it is , " said Father Spinsky in the same firm tone . " There will be other use for this money . " " What other use ? " asked Mary Spinsky . " I do not yet know . I must have a talk with Father Paul . " " With Father Paul ! " There was amazement in the sister 's voice.  |p217Father  Spinsky did not answer . He felt it would be useless to answer at this time . And he was thinking new thoughts of Father Paul as he ate his plenteous , well-cooked dinner . What about Father Paul 's dinners all these months ? The man lived alone . There had been no funds at St. Michael 's for a housekeeperor a cook . Did he have proper food ? Had he always had the money to buy proper food ? Had there been days when he , Father Spinsky , was stuffing himself at this table and a fellow cleric a few streets along had sat down to bread and coffee ! Perhaps only bread ! Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner . He spoke abruptly . " Mary , do you know someone who could be gotten to keep house for Father Paul  --  come in and cook for him ? " Mary Spinsky did not understand this solicitude , but she would not fail as an information bureau . " There is a woman in his parish whose husband died last month . She is a good cook . I think she would like to earn some money . " " I will get her name from you tomorrow , " said Father Spinsky . " First , I will have to speak to Father Paul . I think he should have someone to look out for him . " This was not at all understandable , but something less understandablewas still to come . Mary Spinsky brought in a large chocolate cake which she had spent the entire morning making . It was her brother 's favorite dessert . She was about to cut him a generous portion  --  one for herself , also  --  but Father Spinsky raised his hand . " Wait , Mary , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I want you to do it yourself . The cake looks wonderful . And I know how good it will taste . Cut it in half . Take half to Father Paul at St. Michael 's . Take the other half to the Wyoming Hotel and leave it for William Dunnigan . The food there must be pretty terrible . Say it is from Saint Leo  --  no , say it is from yourself , Father Spinsky 's sister " But I ca n't waste such a cake ! " Mary Spinsky was horrified . " I have used a whole cup of butter and half a dozen eggs ! " " I do n't think it will be wasted , " said Father Spinsky , and directeda fixed gaze at his sister . He was looking at her and yet beyond her.  | " Well , if you say so ! But I ca n't take it till tonight . I have a meeting of our Ladies Aid this afternoon . " " Tonight will do . " What astute plan did her brother now have ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes told her not to questionfurther . There was some clever stratagem behind it , she was sure ! So she offered no further protest . But after the meal she heard him telephoning Philadelphia . " I want another shipment of shrine candles , and send them direct to St. Michael 's . . . Yes , I know , but he is all right now . . . Very well , I guarantee the bill . Charge them to me if you wish .. . Not till next week ? That will be too late . . . Please do the best you can . I will take full responsibility . " Strange words to be heard in the parish house of St. Leo ! Mary Spinsky did not understand . QUITE INNOCENT of the turmoil he had left behind him in the mind of Father Spinsky , Bill Dunnigan quickly finished his business at the other three parish houses . As each parish house had become richer by nearly two thousand dollars ( less the few hundreds they would spend on relief bell ringers and their regular sextons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its wake . Two pastors did not wish to accept the increased rate , knew nothing of it , but Dunnigan was in no pinchpenny mood . Marcus Harris , in his telegram , disclaimed beingclassed as a piker . Far be it from his again loyal employee , William Dunnigan , to belie such an admirable attitude ! All pastors received the same amount as Father Spinsky . He had a bone to pick , however , with his final creditor , Father Paul . Dunnigan had first to rescue the little priest from ten newspapermen , two newsreel photographers , and three radio reporters who had him surrounded just outside his church where he had been watching the ever-growing line of townspeople entering to view the coffin of the " famous actress , " Olga Treskovna . The coffinp219to which undertaker Orloff had said no one would bother to journey for the purpose of paying their respects . " I do n't know what to do about it all ! " exclaimed a breathless Father Paul , alone at last inside the parish house with Dunnigan . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tower to carry its sound from coast to coast , ' as they said ! They gave my sexton ten dollars to ring it faster while they were there ! They 're coming back at six to broadcast it again . My little bell that even Coaltown would not listen to ! " Father Paul was both disturbed and thrilled . " You say they gave the sexton ten dollars ? " " Why , yes . I 'm glad for him . He is a poor man who has been loyal . We were very far in arrears with his salary . " " What did they leave for Saint Michael ? " asked Bill Dunnigan aggressively . " Why  --  I do n't know . I do n't think they thought of that . " " They would not ! And neither would you ! But they 'll think of it when they come back at six . I 'll be here myself to prod their memories . And it wo n't be any ten bucks ! " " I tried to find you this morning , Mr. Dunnigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel to see if you approved of all this  --  this public attention . It is n't turning out to be a private funeral as you wanted ! " " No , it sort of got away from me , " admitted Bill Dunnigan with : Q solemn face , " I had to go to Nanticoke on business . But now I 'm back , and everything is under control . " And it got into the newspapers , " continued Father Paul . " I , , e n't seen them , but they say both Wilkes-Barre and Scranton printed several columns about it . And all these reporters who have come this morning ! I do n't know what to tell them ! " " Do n't worry , Father , " said Dunnigan . " I ' 11 handle them . I here 's one thing , however , that is n't hunky-dory . Do you mean to say you would have let that big lummox  --  excuse me , Father  --  that Father Spinsky put it over on you ! " " You mean his suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I mean just that ! " " But he has a larger and finer church . " Bill Dunnigan exploded . " Look here , Father , do n't you get to talking like the crazy place in California where I just came from ! 22o THE MIIRACLE OF THE BELLSp220Out there everything is bigger and better ! Bigger and better , hell ! Excuse me , Father . Size has nothing to do with fine things . Smaller and finer is our motto ! Have n't you got the swellest church and the swellest Saint in this town ? " " I have tried to think so , " said the priest with a glance at the picture of the victorious Saint Michael on his wall . He did not know quite what Mr. Dunnigan meant by " swell " as applied to Saint Michael and his church , but it evidently was a term of highest approbation . " Then say sot " cried Dunnigan , and rose from his folding chair and paced the floor , with pauses in front of Father Paul at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody else ! Say it good and loud ! Was n't it your Saint who took on Kid Lucifer and put him clown and out for the full count ! Saint Michael was always tops ! Remember that ! And your church is going to be tops around here ! Does the radio want to pipe the sound of anybody else 's bell from coast to coast ? No ! Your bell is in a class with Big Ben in London  --  the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia ! Because it 's big ? No ! Because it 's the bell that 's started something fine ! I would n't let you move this funeral to WestminsterAbbey , if it were here ! I forgot  --  that 's a Protestant hangout ! I would n't let you move it to St. Peter 's of Rome ! No , not even to St. Patrick 's on Fifth Avenue ! " " I 'm happy that you feel that way , " said Father Paul . " I confess I really did n't want to do it ! " " This girl would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would have carried that coffin back here on my own shoulders if necessary ! " Dunnigan seated himself again . " But this Father Spinsky has done you a service , " he continued . " He raised the ante on the bell ringing when I turned him down . Thought I could n't make good , I guess ! He did n't know the undefeated champion , no less and none other than Battling Saint Michael the Scrapper , was on our side ! " Bill Dunnigan looked toward the picture on the wall and shook his locked hands in its direction in proper prize-ring congratulatory fashion . He noticed that Father Paul made a movement at the phrase " Saint Michael the Scrapper . " " I meant no disrespect , Father , " hep221explained . " Quite the contrary ! That Saint of yours is the goods ! I know ! " He took the new Nanticoke checkbook from his pocket . " I 'm going to write you a check for one thousand nine hundred and fifty dollars  --  on a Nanticoke bank so you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it  --  a check to pay for the ringing of your bell up to and through the funeral service Friday . And you 're going to have another thousand from those radio tightwads or I 'll eat my shirt ! " Bill 's shirt that day was a rich lilac and really looked edible . Father Paul got up and then sat down again . All this was too fantastic to be true ! Money could not really be pouring from the skies in such a veritable deluge ! Yesterday he could not even meet his candle bills . Today there was the means for paying every bill , for repairing St. Michael 's , for doing all the impossible things he dreamed of doing ! And yet he was disturbed , for he could not help but recall a part of Mr. Dunnigan 's first conversation the evening before . " Mr. Dunnigan , " he said , " I do n't understand . You told me this girl did not leave much money . I do not think you are a wealthy man , in spite of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me you were pressed for money . You spoke of five hundred dollars in a savings bank , and I saw you turn over that bankbook to Father Spinsky . It is n't any of my business , but I must ask you about all this money . " Bill Dunnigan looked straight into the eyes of Father Paul . There was anxiety , fear , in the deep , honest eyes of the St. Michael 's pastor . " That 's all right , Father , " he said . " You have the right to ask . I ask you just to trust me . As I begged you yesterday to trust me . I have n't robbed a bank ! " and he smiled . " It 's honest money . This girl has powerful friends . Friends who have a lot of what it tikes . They want me to carry out her wishes . Do everything sheacted done . If it comes right down to it , Father , the moneyally belongs to this girl . And a lot more besides ! She would ave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  was working six ours before she died . Does that relieve your mind ? Will you till trust me ? " " I will trust you , " said Father . Paul . His eyes had cleared of their stress . " But I can not accept any more money from you  --  fromp222this girl 's estate , as you put it . Why , already nearly five hundred dollars has come to St. Michael 's from the collection and the shrine boxes at my early Mass ! And those boxes are being filled hourly as all these people go from the coffin to the shrines . I can hardly believe it has happened in one morning in my church ! It is almost as much as we took in the whole of last year ! " " Father , " said Dunnigan , " you want to do things for your church  --  for Coaltown . It will take more than just wanting and your own good work . It will take money . You 're going to have that money now . You 're going to earn it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mass at five forty-five , " said Father Paul . " It had always been such a failure ! Sometimes nobody came . It was like everything else I tried to do here . But this morning ! " " I know . I 've heard all about it , " said Dunnigan . " And it 's grand ! I was happy for your sake . I wish I could have seen it . But all your Masses from now on are going to be like that . " " I do n't expect any such miracle , " said Father Paul . " But I shall always remember and be grateful for this morning . Something happened , however , just before you came that is a miracle . " " What is that ? " asked Dunnigan . " Father Spinsky has just sent over many boxes of shrine candles , after refusing me this morning . You see , I was all out of them . And I probably ca n't get any for a week , even with the money to pay the bill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and refuses any payment ! " " You mean Father Spinsky would not take money ! " " The assistant who brought them would take nothing . Father Spinsky 's orders . Said the Father had talked very strangely . That these candles were an offering from Saint Leo to Saint Michael the Scrapper ! That did n't sound like Father Spinsky either . It sounded like you , Mr. Dunnigan . " And Father Paul waited with a quizzical smile . " I give you my word I did n't pay for them ! " said Dunnigan . " And I did n't ask Father Spinsky to send candles . I knew nothing at all about it . I may have mentioned Saint Michael  --  Saint Michael the Scrapper  --  that 's just my way of thinking of him , Father  --  but I 'm as surprised as you are ! Maybe miracles do happen ! "  |p223Bill  Dunnigan little guessed then what he was now prophesying . He took out his fountain pen and wrote check number five . He made no notation on this check regarding " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , then wrote , " On account  --  to Saint Michael the Scrapper . " " Have you a bank account , Father ? " he asked . " I did have one . I have n't used it for quite a time . " " I have a hunch it 's going to get active again , " said Bill Dunnigan . " This will give it a running start . " Father Paul looked at the piece of paper handed him . Nearly two thousand dollars ! But to him it was not a pile of dollars . It was a pile of hopes at last to be realized , a pile of dreams that would come true . He put the check in his drawer , but he did not lock the drawer . There was no lock on it . There was never a lock on the dreams of Father Paul . " I do not know how to thank you , Mr. Dunnigan , " he said . His voice was a little choked . " I think I 'd like to step into my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church . Shall we go there now ? " " I think we will go there now , " said Bill Dunnigan . " And by the way , Father , my pals all call me Bill . I do n't know , you being a priest " " That 's all right  --  Bill , " said Father Paul . And he placed both hands for a brief moment and held firmly against the strong arms that were cased in sleeves of a pale red and blue check on grey . They went out onto the parish house lawn into the sunlight of a perfect afternoon . The bells were ringing steadily . Their sound seemed to be a part of that sunlight , transmuting it into a paean of courage and joy . And its resonant beat no longer brought moments of terror to the hearts of these two friends . MARCUS HARRIS was having a busy time atthe offices of Super Pictures , Inc. , in Radio City , city of New York . He interviewed a gathering of nine reporters representing all the New York dailies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with several stations of purely local outlet . He talked to newspapermen who had called him by long distance from Boston , Philadelphia , and Chicago . The New York special writer of the Christian Science Monitor phoned to ask how he could reach Coaltown . Two newsreel organizations and a national press photographicservice had requested the same information . Never before had any star or any picture created such an advance furor . He wondered if he had sent enough money to Dunnigan . Such expert exploitation was cheap at any price . The press agent might have some more inspired ideas that would require instant cash . He told Miss Feinberg to get the bank via the private wire . " I ordered a transfer of money to a bank in Nanticoke , Pennsylvania , " he spoke to the head cashier . " We have already sent it , Mr. Harris . It is too late now to cancel it . Your own treasurer came and insisted on an immediate transfer . " " Yes ! Yes ! That 's all right ! I do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank that Mr. Dunnigan 's check is good for any additional amount he may need . You understand . Any amount . " " Certainly , " came the answer . Marcus Han-is carried a very sizable business balance . His Wall Street backing was well-known . And that was why Father Spinsky had been told of the unlimited credit of his " apparition " of Saint Michael . Harris also called his Hollywood Studios . They had heard the news already . The Los Angeles papers all carried full stories wired by the press associations . " Good ! " he told the excited studio manager . " Put Garden of the Soul ' in the works . Start the cutting and editing . Start the musical dubbing . Rush us here as many stills as you can , and photographs of Treskovna . We are entirely out of them . And for God 's sake , tell that crazy director and the crazier Victor George , if they do n't know it already , that I 've changed my mind ! " " They both know about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their billing . The director wants his name " Yes , yes ! He wants his name twice as large as anyone else 's , and Victor George does n't see why anybody else 's name but his should be billed at all ! I 'll be back next week sometime to face those headaches , They 'll be a pleasure compared to what I have been through !  |p225I  want to see an edited film when I return . And do n't cut any scenes or shots in which Treskovna appears . We ca n't take more of her . We want every inch of her we have ! " To his head cameraman he sent a personal wire . He telegraphed : TELL WHISTLER AND THE OTHER FELLOW YOU MENTIONED TO CHEER UP STOP I 'LL GIVE THEM PERMISSION TO PAINT TRESKOVNAFROM YOUR CAMERA SHOTS WHEN THE FILM IS RE-LEASEDThe early editions of the afternoon papers were brought it . Every one carried front page columns , and photographs of Olga Treskovna . At two o'clock he again had Mrs. Harris on the private wire . " You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have been there , Marcus . It is all right . The Vilna Rabbi was there . He has offered prayers for you . He says Irving would wish you to do exactly as you are doing . " " It is wonderful , Rachel ! Four hours ago I was in despair . I knew I had been unjust . I knew I was also ruining myself . But I was afraid . Now I seem to be on top of the world . I hope nothing bad will happen to spoil it . " " Nothing will , my darling  --  except I know you have n't eaten any lunch . You have n't , have you ? " " I 've had no time , " said Marcus Harris . " The bankers are cominghere at two-thirty . That is the best sign of all , Rachel . When Wall Street will come to you ! When you do n't have to run down to them ! It means they smell profits ahead . " " You take time to smell some food ! That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I will . I 'll have something sent in . Did the Rabbi say he would make a prayer for William Dunnigan ? " " He will make that prayer also . " " Send out for the evening papers , dear . Mr. Dunnigan has accomplishedwonders . " " I will . And you send out for some lunch . " Marcus Harris rang for Miss Feinberg . " Order me some lunch from the Rainbow Room grill , " he said , " and take another wire for Mr. Dunnigan . Send it to Wyoming Hotel , Coaltown . Pay for a messenger to get it there if there 's no office directly in that town . Say :  | ' DEAR WILLIAM , IF YOU NEED MORE MONEY , THAT NANTICOKE BANK WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU .

It was the first wire Marcus Harris had so signed , except to his wife , in many years . BILL DUNNIGAN and Father Paul stood in a side aisle of the church . To escape the reporters and the crowds they had entered by the rear door behind the altar . The interior of St. Michael 's was surprisingly lovely . One would never have guessed it from its dilapidated appearance outside . The altar was simple  --  a plain , black marble shelf , but behind it was a high , three-paneled wooden screen framed in fretwork painted gold . On the three tall panels of the screen were three painting ; which looked like the pictures in medieval illuminated manuscript ' . The center picture was of the Holy Mother seated on a throne , with the Christ Child on her knee . The side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands clasped before them , and each facing toward the Holy Mother . Around the heads of these firgures , were wide halos of gold . Their costumes were blue and white and green . They knelt on steps of carpeted crimson on which white roses were strewn , and the high back of the Virgin 's throne was deep crimson . In the background was a distant landscape  --  mountains  --  trees -- a monas tery on a hill . This screen was , in truth , a priceless work . Some unsung Polish Fra Angelico had given it the breath of living beauty . It had been brought from Poland by the first priest of the church.  |p227At  each side of the altar were two solid marble statues , larger than life-size . One was of Saint Michael . The other , the Virgin holding the Child . They also were well-carved and had come to Coaltown from the mother country . High around the side walls were the customary Stations of the Cross  --  represented by paintings some three feet square set in narrow gold frames , with a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and foreign in design , and the reading on the lower border of each frame was in Polish . They started with " Jesus Is Condemned to Death " and carried through to " Jesus Is Laid in the Sepulcher . " The side walls were a dull grey . Four small windows of stained glass were placed along and near the top of each side wall . The ceiling was raftered and followed the slant of the outside roof . It had become a dark brown . There was a wide aisle up the center and down each side . The side proceeding from the bell tower was of extra width , as the width of this tower continued back to the altar . Four shrines were placed here  --  four Saints in painted plaster set above small altars . These were the usual figures made in America , but they had been well selectedand had character . They represented Saint Joseph holding the crowned Child in his arms ; a figure of the dead Christ stretched in the arms of the kneeling Holy Mother ; the bearded Saint Jude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal candle racks and the narrow altar rails . There were two more candle racks at the front of the church outside the altar rail . The marble statues were inside the altar rail . The bare , brown coffin of Olga Treskovna was before the altar in the center aisle , guarded by its three tall candles on each side . The steady line of worshipers was passing before it . Probably a hundred people were inside the church . As some left , others entered . The church had a small choir loft above the main doorway and the organ was playing softly . The blind organist had come to pay her respects to the dead girl . She played well  --  some sacred music that seemed to Dunnigan to blend with the ringing of the bell . He remembered how Olga Treskovna had told him she used to sit on the church steps and listen to this organ . " Do you think it is all as your friend would have wished ? " asked Father Paul.  | " I am sure it is , " said Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not in that coffin . That the coffin there in the center aisle represented merely what the world had to think because she had " died . " He did not know just where she was  --  but the Olga Treskovna he knew was not there , prone , without life . They moved down the side aisle and out of the church by the main doorway . " I am saying the Rosary and other prayers for the dead tonight at seven , " said the priest . " Will you be here  --  Bill ? " he added . " Yes , " said Dunnigan . " I will come . But you must n't mind , Father , if I do n't sit quietly all through . I  --  I may have to go out for a smoke . But I 'll be at the back where I wo n't disturb anyone . You see , I always was a sort of in-and-outer  --  standing awhile at the front , ducking backstage , on the sidewalk for a smoke , then back in again ! Maybe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he added doubtfully . " Maybe I ought to have a section in the church  --  just for smokers , " said Father Paul with a smile . " It 's an idea , " said Bill . " But I 'll be here promptly at six to see those radio people . I 'll stay with them to a finish ! That 's right in my line . " Father Paul returned through the church to his parish house  --  his only escape from the curious and the newsmen . Bill Dunnigan stood on the steps . If Olga Treskovna could only see and hear all this ! There was a voice close beside him . " Bill , is n't the organ music beautiful  --  just like I told you ? " She sat on the lower step . She did not wear the clothes in which he had known her . She was barefooted . Her dress was a faded cottonslip . Her long , brown hair hung over her shoulders and was drawn together at her neck with a green ribbon . " Kid , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's beautiful . But now it 's all for you , kid . The organist is playing just for you . The church bells are ringing just for you . The whole town is coming here just for you . " " I 'm glad , " she said . " I 'm glad to bring more music to the town . It 's been lovely to hear the organ once again ! But now I 've got to go home and cook supper for pop . Pop gets home early today . 1 ' 11 be seeing you , Bill-on Forty-Second Street . "  | " But I have a car now , kid . I 'll drive you home . You do n't have to walk borne any more . " " No . That would n't be right . Pop would n't understand if I drove up in a big car . He 'd think something was wrong . So-long , Bill . " She arose and moved down the wooden steps and across the street . Bill Dunnigan watched her go and his heart felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not do . She was not there , of course . It was just thinking back to what Olga Treskovna had told him about sitting on the church steps . Yet she had seemed to be there  --  living over again some moments of happiness . Was that what happened when we " died " ? He lit a cigar . The Harris money had provided for a supply of the Coaltown Drug Store 's best  --  eight centers , two for fifteen cents . He got into his waiting car  --  even for the half block to the hotel . He hoped she might be there beside him  --  he would ask her about it all  --  but she was not there . He was just a little tired . He needed a bath and a shave . Father Spinsky 's early call had cheated him of those customary day-starters . And he would take a nap before the evening service of Father Paul , which he had promised to attend . In the hotel lobby were more reporters waiting . Two had come from Philadelphia . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soul ' will be released after all ? The New York papers say Marcus Harris has changed his mind . " " I do not know , " said Dunnigan . " Such information must come from Mr. Harris in New York . I have no knowledge of his plans . I hope the report is true . " " Just when is the funeral to be ? " asked a newsman from Philadelphia . " It will be on Friday . Miss Treskovna wanted the Angelus to sound the final ringing of the Coaltown bells for herself and her father . " And that was n't a bad idea , mused Mr. Dunnigan . It was a t --  -- 't he had not thought of before . " Is it true that over two thousand dollars a day is being paid for the ringing of the bells ? " " The cost of this ceremony is not a matter of consequence or of public interest , " said Mr. Dunnigan . " If Olga Treskovna saw fit to set aside a week 's salary for this tribute to her father 's memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk of money . I must ask you to excuse me . I am a little tired . There will be a service at the Church of St. Michael at seven this evening . Father Paul 's famous and most popular early Mass at five forty-five tomorrow morning will be held as usual . I especially advise your attendance at this early Mass to see the hold this great Saint  --  Saint Michael , the patron of that church -- -has on the hearts of this community . " And if you have not already viewed the interior of St. Michael 's you will find a surprising jewel hidden beneath its plain exterior . Note especially the painting of the altar screens and the Stations of the Cross , which are a bit of Old World beauty transported with loving reverence from Poland to America . " He must learn more about such things , Bill thought , if he was to press-agent St. Michael 's ! He paused before he got in too deeply , and stepped to the desk clerk for his room key . The clerk handed him a telegram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second wire from Marcus Harris . " Gentlemen , " he said turning again to the newsmen , " I can now tell you that ' The Garden of the Soul ' will be released . My friend , Marcus Harris , has just wired me . There had been a clamor for it from Maine to California . So the final masterpiece of this girl 's artistry will not be lost . I will look forward to seeing you , sirs , at St. Michael 's at seven  --  or tomorrow morning at the early Mass . " Having made the first announcement of a church service in his varied career , Mr. Dunnigan ascended to his room . He left word he was not to be disturbed . Events had overwhelmed even him . TWO HOURS LATER Dunnigan sat by the open window in his room . It was about five o'clock . He wore his " sleeper-jump " bathrobe , a Sulka creation of broad crimson and white stripes . He had taken a nap , a shave , two baths , one before and one after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was reading again the telegram from Marcus Harris . He had needed just that . He knew , of course , that " The Garden of the Soul " would be completedwhen Harris had sent the money  --  knew that he was once more its official press agent . But it was good to have Marcus Harris say it in so many words . Work  --  work for Marcus Harris , for Olga Treskovna , for Father Paul , for Saint Michael  --  work was the antidote to the loneliness that sometimes got the best of him . He had noted the form of the signatureon the telegram . Marcus Harris was now not just his boss . He was his friend . If trouble came , and it probably would , he could count on Marcus Harris to stand by . There were five of them now , five musketeers : Father Paul , Saint Michael , Olga Treskovna , himself  --  and Marcus Harris . It somehowreminded him of a bronze sculpture on upper Fifth Avenue representing a charging group of American soldiers of World War One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( thought Dunnigan 's theater mind )  --  the Catholic priest in his cassock , the armored archangel , the barefooted girl as she had looked on the church steps , himself , and the little Jewish picture producer .. . But that was America . For his part he must move carefully . He must not appear in Coaltown to be a press agent for a film . There he was simply the friend of Olga Treskovna . And matters were progressing so well that in Coaltown the news would speak for itself . Reporters could report on facts  --  not what he , Dunnigan , might say . " The Garden of the Soul " must only be mentioned as the finest of Olga Treskovna'swork . New York must supply any other facts about it . One thing he could " promote " from Coaltown  --  Father Paul and St. Michael 's church . Saint Michael , also , for there was now in his heart a very sincere belief  --  a gratitude  --  that somehow he had been helped by this Saint . Dunnigan was not religious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that morning . He had not suddenly acquired " religion " in Coaltown . It was more a feeling of loyalty to his pals  --  Father Paul and Saint Michael . He thought of Saint Michael as a pal . And he was not quite sure just what he could do . Just what he should do . You could n't promote a priest , a church , a saint , as you would a musical show or Eddie Cantor or a feature film . Or could you ? One thing he knew . Father Paul , that most unselfish and unbusinesslikeof men , must get what money he was rightly entitled to . Here was the opportunity for funds to lay a firm foundation for all the splendid things the priest wished to try . Those radio people , for example --  -- they must be made to pay . They would gladly pay . Perhaps a whole Mass could be broadcast ? Dunnigan did not know . He had heard church services over the air . It had been done . Broadcasting the sound of the St. Michael 's bell was something he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be certain it was announced as " from the Church of St. Michael the Archangel of Coaltown , the Reverend Father Paul , pastor . " He had spoken with such assurance of being a press agent for Father Paul ; for the Church and its Saint ; for God Almighty even  --  but it was n't quite as easy as just saying it . Well , he had mentioned this early Mass to the reporters . That would help if they spoke of it in their news stories . After the success of that morning he did n't want this Mass to slip back and fail Father Paul . Five forty-five was a hell of an early hour ! Perhaps there were objects inside that church that held a story . That altar backing . Those quaint pictures . He 'd manufacture a story if they did n't have one ! Just how did you publicize a church ! He must cudgel his brain to the very limit to help Father Paul . There was a faint , hesitating knock at his door . The chambermaidmost likely . " Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow . It opened and a young man stood there . Evidently a local young man wearing a cap and dressed in his Sunday best . He looked awkward and uncomfortable in the thick , store-made suit and the tight collar . The face seemed vaguely familiar . " Are you Mr. Dunnigan of New York ? " said the youth . " I thought I left orders no one was to come up  --  " commenced Bill . " I know , sir . I hope you 'll pardon me , sir  --  " The lad had taken a step inside the room and removed his cap . He stopped , mouth open , in the middle of his apology , staring with popping eyes at the man who lounged by the window.  | " As long as you 're here , come in , " said Dunnigan . " What can I do for you , son ? " The voice also of this lad had a familiar pitch . " But I had no idea I 'd see you ! " gasped his visitor and looked as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slippered feet from the window sill and leaned forward so that he could better view his unannounced caller . " You do n't remember me ? " the intruder now managed to say . Dunnigan experienced that most absurdly elusive of mental graspings  --  trying to place a familiar personage seen apart from his customarybackground  --  the bartender away from his bar  --  the cigarcounterclerk away from his shop  --  the bellboy out of his uniform . " I seem to remember you well , " he said , " hut just where  --  " " I talked to you this morning ! I 'm sure it was you , sir ! You were dressed differently , of course . But I cooked you your breakfast in Nanticoke ! The Special -- ham and eggs and coffee and toast . Forty-five cents ! And you bought a Phillie and gave me your last  --  gave me a quarter to buy a flower for my girl ! " Dunnigan knew after the first sentence . The red hair was now bobbing as vigorously as it had above the lunch-room counter . The eager face with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work jacket was missing . But the press agent lay back in his chair and laughed and let the lad finish his speeches . " Sure ! Sure ! " he said cordially . " I apologize , kid ! I 've been through quite a lot today . Have a chair , my friend . So you 've tracked me down ! " And he laughed again . He needed that laugh , he felt . The boy sat gingerly on the edge of one of Dunnigan 's chairs . He twisted his cap in his hands . " I  --  I wanted to see the millionaire like I told you . William Dunniganthe papers said his name was ; and when the clerk only laughed at me when I asked to have my card sent up , I looked on the registerwhile he was n't looking and it said room 1-A opposite this name . So I sneaked up the stairs . I guess the millionaire must have gone back to New York for you 're the man now in 1-A . " " Yes  --  I 'm the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad smile. , The dejection on the lad 's face was almost tragic . " I 've come too late , " he said , and then , biting his lip , " Tell me ,  | mister , why do people always laugh at me ? The clerk downstairs laughed ! You laugh ! Am I as silly as all that ! " Bill Dunnigan regarded the unhappy countenance opposite him . The lad who had served him with an extra cup of coffee when he was down to his last eighty cents . The lad who had suggested that if he were " short " the next day he might get a meal with the check " held over . " Thank God , Marcus Harris had come through ! Bill lifted himself from his chair and stood above the boy who had worked in the Breaker at Wanamee and now wanted to own his own Quick Lunch . The boy who always made people laugh . He put a kindly hand on the shoulder of the cheap , ill-fitting store suit . " Kid , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make folks laugh ! There 's damn few of us can do that . This world would be a hell of a better place if some more of us could ! And now you and me are going to get down to brass tacks about this Quick Lunch business . But first , kid  --  did your girl friend like the flower ? " " Why , yes  --  " The face brightened a little . " I bought her a rose . She thought you were awfully kind , sir  --  said she 'd like to meet you and thank you herself . " " Good . I 'll meet her someday . Now just how much was it that you two needed for this business start you want to make ? " " It is two hundred and fifty dollars , sir , but now that I 've missed out on the millionaire Bill Dunnigan had taken the pale blue and red-checked coat from the back of another chair . He removed a long envelope from the inside pocket of that coat and unsnapped a rubber band from around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the eyes of the lad nearly burst from his head . " I think you 'd better have three hundred , kid , " he said . " Things always cost a little more than you plan . " He placed the money in the boy 's hand and closed that hand tightly around it . " That 's because you made me smile this morning when God knows I had need of a smile ! " Bill Dunnigan replaced the envelope in his coat pocket and went back to his chair by the window . The boy from Nanticoke wanted to rise but something had happened to his legs . To his throat , also . " But I  --  I do n't even know your name , sir , and you do n't know mine ! " he gasped at last.  |p235Bill  Dunnigan lit a cigar . " You know my name all right , kid , " he said . " And if you want to tell me yours , you can . " " But you 're not  --  you 're not the millionaire William Dunnigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know of around here , " said Bill , " or anywhere else for that matter . There used to be a cop on Delancy Street in New York with the same name , but he got himself bumped off ! " " But , Mr. Dunnigan , you had your breakfast in the Lunch where I work  --  I saw you counting your change ! " " Sure . We all have mornings when we have to count our change . And it is n't always we meet up with a pal who will push out an extra cup of coffee ! I 'm no millionaire , boy . That 's just newspapertalk . I do n't mind . I 've been called worse than that lots of times ! " " But can you really afford to back me ! You really want to do it ! " The lad looked down at the bills still in his hand . He had never seen such large bills before . They crinkled when he squeezed them ! They were real  --  not something he was dreaming ! " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Dunnigan . " I 'd lost my job when you saw me this morning . I guess you brought me luck for I got it back again , got it back with a raise , right after eating your Special ! I 'd made up my mind to back you , if things came through . I was going to stop in tomorrow for another Special , and to find out when you wanted to start that Quick Lunch Heaven  --  Two Cups of Coffee . ' " This time the boy got to his feet . Ile felt a little dizzy but he could stand . " I  --  thanks ! Thanks , Mr. Dunnigan ! " he stammered . " I ca n't tell you what this means to me , and to my girl ! We can get married now ! " He dove into his pocket and produced a small card . " Here is my card , sir ! " And he handed it proudly to his benefactor . Dunnigan read : ROBERT OMANSKYEXPERT SHORT-ORDER MANNANTICOKE , PA . This time the press agent suppressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards now , Robert , " he said . " How soon can you start ? "  | The answer came with a bursting rush . " I can start right away , sir ! There 's a place I can buy out , on the Main Square . I used to work there . It 's a much better location than where I work now ! I 'll see them tonight . They want a thousand dollars but I can pay two hundred and fifty cash and the rest out of the profits each month . " " Maybe you can pay them all cash , so that you start clean , " said Dunnigan . " You talk to them , kid . " " They might take less , if I paid it all at once ! " " Sure ! Find out , and you can tell me tomorrow when I drop in for another Special . By the way , Robert , I 've got an idea for you to work on . " " I 'll do anything you want , Mr. Dunnigan ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know anything about restaurants but eating in them . If I try to butt in after this , do n't listen to me ! It 's your show , kid . But I want you to do just one thing for me that may help my show . Invent a special kind of sandwich . " Dunnigan paused , searching for a word . " A wonder sandwich that will knock ' em for a loop ! " " You mean something to make my place famous ! Something they ca n't get anywhere else ? " " You 've got the idea exactly ! " Dunnigan rose and looked out of his window . The crowd moving into St. Michael 's had not diminished . It seemed to be larger than two hours before . He turned to the lad who was watching him with eager eyes . " . I want this sandwich filled with all the good things that can be put between two layers of bread  --  the bread that 's sort of like our life  --  get me , kid ?  --  so that right here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good you could think of , or dream of , or pray for  --  in a lifetime ! " " Gee ! That would have to be a smasher ! " " Smasher is right ! A sandwich you 'd want to be born for and live for and fight for and die for ! " " Every bite a banquet ? " said Robert Omansky , coiner of slogans as well as " Short-Order expert . " " You 're better than I am , kid ! " said Dunnigan , and he laughed happily . " But what will you put in it , so that it measures up to all this ! " The lad wrinkled a freckled brow under the flaming crown of red . " I think I 'd make it of chicken and very crisp bacon and Virginiap237ham and crab meat  --  crab meat will give it an unusual flavor  --  and then some lettuce and tomato , a few slices of hard-boiled egg , just a little garlic and a little mustard  --  I 'll cook the ham in mustard  --  that will give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the things we want ! " said Bill . " And I 'll use a special bread  --  there 's a kind called Irish Soda that makes your mouth water when it 's toasted ! It has raisins in it too ! " " Something Irish always helps ! " smiled Bill . " I 'll work hard on it , sir  --  I ' 11 talk to my girl about it ! " " That 's the stuff ! It wants to be so wonderful a customer will never forget it ! Come across a continent to eat it again ! Thank God for the rest of his life he had met up with it ! " " Yes sir , Mr. Dunnigan , sir ! " The lad 's face was agog at the glowing qualifications of this wonder sandwich to be ! " And here 's the name for it , " continued Dunnigan , " The St. Michael Sandwich . " " You mean the Saint that churches are named for ? " It was both question and surprise . " That 's the guy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So you see why it 's got to be good ! Your place will be ' Quick Lunch Heaven . ' Let 's have a sandwich named after the swellest Saint up there ! " " Gosh ! That is an idea ! " gasped the excited boy . " I could paint that on the window alsoHome of the St. Michael SandwichEvery Bite a Banquet ! " The lad gestured with his finger as he painted each magic word . " You certainly could , " smiled Mr. Dunnigan . The boy was still holding the three hundred-dollar bills in his hand . Their reality gripped him now . " You 'll want some written agreement , Mr. Dunnigan  --  maybe you 'll make it out ? And I 'll give you a receipt . " Dunnigan raised his hand . " No , boy . I 'm not much on written agreements . Never found I had to have ' em with gentlemen . You just get things going pronto ! My address in New York is Radio City . You can write me there . But I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seeing you before I go . "  | " You 're half owner then , sir  --  Mr. Dunnigan . My girl knows how to keep accounts and I 'll send you a statement every week . " " Half owner is n't fair . What about your girl ? " " She and I will own the other half . " " No dice . We 'll split it three ways , kid . You and me and your girl . I got a hunch that she 's O. K. And you pay yourself and your girl a fair salary before you figure any profits . " " Gosh ! Gosh , Mr. Dunnigan ! I did n't know there were people like you around ! There ai n't  --  around here ! When  --  when can I bring my girl to meet you ? " " Do you go to Mass ? " " Not often , sir . But my girl does . " " What time do you start work tomorrow ? " " I do n't go on till seven tomorrow morning . My girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting up early ? " " I 'm always up at five o'clock . When we 've got our own place I 'll be up at four to do the buying at the markets . Once I overslept till six , but my girl and I had been to a dance . There 'll be no dances when we 're running Quick Lunch Heaven ! " " I hope there 'll be a lot of dances ! " laughed Bill , " but tomorrow , do n't oversleep , and be at the Nanticoke Garage at five-thirty  --  you and your girl . I 've got a car there . I 'll tell my driver to bring you over for the five forty-five Mass at St. Michael 's church up the street . He 'll take you back after it 's over . Tell the girl to say a little prayer for the new Quick Lunch Heaven ! " " She 'll be doing that tonight , sir , if I know her ! She 's been lightingcandles to it for a year ! " " Atta girl ! I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you tomorrow  --  do n't lose your money ! " For the excited lad still held the bills in his hand . The boy pushed the money deep into his trouser pocket . " Mr. Dunnigan  --  thanks , Mr. Dunnigan ! " he managed to gasp again . " I  --  you  --  can I shake your hand , Mr. Dunnigan  --  we being partners . " Mr. Dunnigan put out his hand . " Shake , partner , " he said . Another citizen of Pennsylvania was seeing a Saint , but Robert Omansky 's version wore no armored shin greaves and mounted no black charger . His Saint just stood in a hotel room in a long crim/son and white dressing gown and was smoking an eight cent cigar . " I 'll get back to Nanticoke to tell my girl ! " the boy cried and ran for the door . As a " businessman " he did not wish another businessmanto see the tears in his eyes . " And do n't forget to work on the St. Michael Every-Bite-a-Banquet Super-Sandwich ! " Bill Dunnigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . God , but he was glad that nice kid did n't have to be let down ! And he was making a start with Saint Michael . It was n't much of a start  --  still  --  a cigar named after her had helped glorify Anna Held ! You never could tell ! A young man named Robert Omansky had entirely conquered the laws of gravity . He had rushed out of Room t-A , down the stairs , across the floor of the lobby of the Wyoming Hotel , treading the thin air only , as he struggled with the much less difficult problem of inventing an unforgettable sandwich that would amaze and conquer the universe ' BILL DUNNIGAN attended his first churchservice in many years from the St. Michael 's choir loft . By seven o'clock it was the only space in the church , except the sanctuary before the altar , that was not solidly occupied . A standing-roomonlyhouse , he would have called it , and that other abused theater expression , " hundreds turned away , " would have been literally true . They were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the street , and uttered responses along with those who could crowd inside . The wide , front doors remained open throughout the service . He had entered the choir loft from the bell tower . In the tower he had interviewed the representative of the local radio station of the Green Network , and secured Father Paul the tidy sum of three thousand dollars for the privilege of broadcasting St. Michael 's bell at noon and at six o'clock the remaining three days . Rumors of interest on the part of a rival network had not retarded consumma- Lion of the deal . For the sexton , also , Dunnigan arranged an extra payment of one hundred dollars as a " broadcasting service fee . " St. Michael 's finances were looking up ! The press agent next had business with the organist . He found her in the choir loft with a younger sister who acted as a " seeing eye " for the musician . " I remember Olga Trocki , " she said . " I remember her when her father died . She came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father loved  --  play it during the funeral . She sang it to me herself until I memorized its melody . But the old priest was very strict . He would only allow what he called sacred music in the church . So I played it like a hymn ! " The woman smiled at this remembrance . " Maybe I did somethingvery wicked , but I wanted to please the girl . She seemed so desperately eager to have that song played ! I 've never forgotten it . " She sat at her organ and struck an opening strain . It was the song Olga Treskovna had sung to Dunnigan in Ming Gow 's that Christmas Eve . " I 'm glad you remember that song , " said Dunnigan . " I want you to play it again when her own funeral service comes . " " I hope Father Paul wo n't object , " said the woman . " The old priest did . I nearly lost my job ! " " But it is as beautiful as any hymn ! " said Dunnigan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organist . " Someone recognized it as a song Mr. Trocki used to sing in the saloons ! " Bill Dunnigan had an idea . " Do you know any other hymn-like Polish songs ? " he asked . " I know a great many , " said the organist . " My mother who taught me music , knew a lot of them . It was just that one song that was new to me . It seemed that song was Mr. Trocki 's musical signature , ' as the advertisers on the radio say  --  his signature when he had been  --  when he had been having too jolly a time . " " But it is a sad song , " said Bill Dunnigan . " We Poles play sad music when we are happy , " said the woman . " This girl loved the old Polish melodies , " said Bill pursuing hisidea . " She once told me she wanted to give a concert sometime inCarnegie Hall in New York . A concert of such songs . She neverlived to do it . You and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ con/cert ! In her memory . We 'll give two concerts . Tomorrow afternoonand on Thursday . You come and play for one hour . Play Polish songs . " " I will gladly do it . But will Father Paul permit ? " " Would the people here like it ? " asked Bill . " It would bring memories to the older ones . " " Then I think I can fix matters with Father Paul . He wo n't object to giving the town some memories of romance and love of beauty . At least no one can say they heard Olga Trocki sing the songs in the saloons ! " " Just keep Father Spinsky of St. Leo 's away ! I always thought he was at the bottom of the complaint when I played for her father , " said the woman . " You find a Polish song about Saint Leo and we 'll disarm Father Spinsky ! " laughed Bill . " I may even invite him to attend ! Make him co-sponsor of the concerts ! " And using the word " sponsor " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be broadcast ; some network would pay to do it while the bell-ringing excitement was on ! " You 'll never get Father Spinsky to step inside St. Michael 's ! " said the woman , " but I wish I had done something like this for the Trocki girl when she was alive . Now she is there in her coffin . Do you think she will hear the songs ? " " She will hear them if we leave the church door open . " " The church door open ? " " Yes . I do n't believe you know , but she used to sit on the steps and listen to you when you were practicing . I have an idea  --  I think you 'll understand  --  that maybe she 'll come and sit there when you play the Polish folk songs . " " That is a nice thought , " said the woman . " I shall try to play them so that if she does come she 'll not be disappointed . " " I want to pay you for all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funeral . " " You can pay the five dollars , if you wish , for the funeral . That is what I usually receive . The other things I 'd like to do just for this girl . I did n't know anyone in the town cared enough for my music to come just to hear me practice ! I wish I had known about it then ! "  | " Perhaps it 's better that you did not know . You would have asked her to come inside and I think she liked to sit out there  --  on the steps . Especially at night , for there was a star she loved . " " Ah , a star , " said the blind woman and there was a sudden lift of her head . " You know , of course , sir , that I am blind . I have never minded . God gave me music to take the place of seeing . I 'll never really see this world  --  I 've never been farther from Coaltown than Scranton ; but I 've traveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to Vienna with Johann Strauss , to Prague with Antonin Dvorak . Oh , I 've been all over with my music ! They arc such beautiful places to me now  --  I might be disappointed if I really saw them . But the stars ! " The blind woman paused a moment . " I love to travel , sir , and when I die , and perhaps really have my eyes , I do n't want to stay in just one place , no matter how beautiful that place may be . I 'm going to ask if I ca n't travel  --  travel among the stars ! That 's really what I 'd like to see  --  the stars . My sister tells me about them  --  they must be wonderful ! They could never disappoint ! " Dunnigan , strong , possessing all his faculties , looked at this woman who could not see , who never had been more than twenty miles from her home . And still she lived in faith and hope and had found joy . He thought that if he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face as she spoke of journeying among the stars . " I think I know what to tell Father Paul about our Polish concert  --  andFather Spinsky also . We will take the older people back to Poland  --  as the guests of Olga Treskovna and yourself . And I think I know how you can make sure of a trip to all the stars . " " You really do , sir ? " " You just ask for Saint Michael when you get there . Tell hint you played all these years in one of his churches . Tell him --  " He was going to say , " Tell him you know Bill Dunnigan , " but he checked himself . " Saint Michael will fix it for you . I know ! " he spoke aloud . He took out his manila envelope . He unsnapped the rubber band and selected a note , folded it and put it in the woman 's hand . " Here is the five dollars for the funeral and a little extra , " he said . " I want you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Poland . You 'll be taking a lot of people along , you know ! "  |p243The  sister looked at the money and was about to speak but Dunniganplaced a finger on his lips . He had given her a hundred dollarsbut he felt even that was little enough . Never again would he quit , no matter what the setback . The church below was filled . Father Paul and his altar boys appeared from the door at the side of the sanctuary . The service was about to start . Dunnigan looked in some dismay over the railing of the choir loft at the solidly-packed crowd below . There did not seem to be a spare inch of space . " Here is where I stay through a service whether I want to or not ! " he said , and crouched on a small stool at one side . It did not prove too difficult . Unseen , he was able to chew on a cigar . During a long stretch of " Hail Marys " he was about to strike a light but caught himself in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you mind , please , if I want to smoke . I got a lot of things to dope out for you and I ca n't think yet without a cigar . I 'm just an amateur press man at this church business , you know ! " He watched the long-handled baskets start on their somewhat perilous rounds ; but in the now expert hands of the druggist and the garage keeper and several volunteer assistants they did manage to pass from hand to hand , over shoulders from pew to pew . From his vantage point it looked as though the " take " was good . He found himself as anxious to learn the " gross " as he would have been if it were the box-office receipts of the second night of a new show ! But what worried Dunnigan , constantly shifting his cigar , was : Why were all these people there and why were they giving ? He feared that it was curiosity . The coffin of an " actress . " That coffinwould be gone in two short days . Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old neglect ? He felt that it was up to him , Bill Dunnigan , not to let this happen . Saint Michael and Father Paul had done their part . Marcus Harris certainly had also . Now it was his turn . To his theater-working mind it all was like a new production . Saint Michael had helped to raise the backing . Bill felt that somehowhe would not have received that money from Marcus Harris but for his answered prayer to that armored Fighter of the church.  | Backer Harris had come through . Stage Manager Father Paul was down there " putting on the show . " But how could you make a show " run " in a place that was not even a one-night stand , as Olga Treskovna had called it ! And with the leading lady leaving in two days ! It looked as though it would take a lot of chewing on cigars to solve this problem . But either he was or he was not a press agent ! A man who could make shows go ! The top man in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! BILL DUNNIGAN and Father Paul sat on thesteps of the Church of St. Michael the Archangel . It was nine o'clock and a full moon was low in the cast casting its glow over the darkened sky and the town . Bill had waited for the priest after the evening service . His Packard had returned from Nanticoke and it had been his plan to drive the Father to Wilkes-Barre or Scranton for a dinner at one of the hotels . But the priest had insisted that they have their supper  --  as he named it  --  in the parish house . So Bill dismissed his driver for the day , with orders to pick up his quick-lunch friend early in the morning and return in time for the five-forty-five Mass . The driver had brought him the New York newspapers he had reserved that morning in the garage town , and he had read the story they carried . Marcus Harris would have been adamant indeed to have resisted their opportunity and appeal ! " I must stay near my church , " Father Paul had explained , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really should have asked some Sisters from the convent in Scranton to keep a vigil by the coffin . They would gladly have come if I had sent word to them . And not having done that , I should myself sit by my altar during the night . " " She would not wish you that hardship , " said Bill . " Or wish that the Sisters lose their rest . The bells are keeping her vigil . " " You do not think she will feel lonely ? "  |p245So  Olga Treskovna was also becoming a living person to Father Paul ! Bill said : " I think that after the busy day  --  it has been a busy day for all of us  --  she will want to rest alone . Father , I do n't know what you believe , but I think she was not there all day . She was with me as I crossed the hills in my car  --  she was on the steps of the church when the organ was playing this afternoon . She went home to cook a supper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should believe such things ? " " I think those nearest us know what we do , " said Father Paul . " I often imagine my mother at her sewing . Your heart can be trusted when it speaks in such a way . " " Then I think that tonight she will sleep well . And in your church . In life she wished to stay alone after a day of work . I remember that . " So they had gone to Father Paul 's little garden at the back of his parish house , cut bright green lettuce and great red tomatoes ; then Bill read his newspaper while Father Paul prepared a salad of these and eggs which he had boiled hard and sliced . He had a dressing of mayonnaise . " I live very simply  --  you are sure this meal will satisfy you ? " he had asked . " It is quite wonderful , " said Bill and meant it . The salad , direct from a garden , had a different taste from those he had ordered in restaurants . Even his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now I 'll make coffee , " said Father Paul . " My stove runs by oil - it 's almost as quick as gas  --  the coffee will be ready very soon . And there 's a big surprise for our dessert ! A box was left at my door just before the evening service . Do you , by any chance , like chocolatecake ? " " Do I ! " said Bill . " I 've sometimes bought a whole one , and eaten ii at one sitting back at my hotels ! And if yours is homemade  --  You must n't raise my expectations too high ! " Father Paul opened the box and placed the half cake that had been left at his door on the table . " It 's homemade right enough , but I do n't know who sent it ! " he said . " There was just this piece of paper inside , " and he handed Bill a sheet torn from a ruled tablet . It read :  | This cake is made with six eggs and a full cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not been wasted . " A generous soul sent it , even if there is no name , " said Father Paul . " I do n't know about that , " said Bill judiciously . " They only sent you half of it ! And wanted to make sure you realized how much it cost to make . The action and the note are a contradiction . They pose a veritable Ellery Queen who-done-it problem ! Now if Sherlock Holmes were here ! But it 's just as well he is n't ! Dr. Watsonwould be along also and with his appetite and Holmes testing samples for clues Dunnigan made a gesture of complete annihilation . " No matter what our vows , our resolution , we are all sinfully selfish at heart , " smiled Father Paul . " A homemade chocolate cake is the acid test . I confess I , too , am glad Dr. Watson is not here ! " The priest started his coffee on the oil stove . Bill Dunnigan eyed the cake . Its exposed inside was a rich yellow , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick between the layers . There was a forming of saliva around his tongue not induced by his cigar . " Do you mind if I try just a small piece ? " he asked . Father Paul smiled again and produced a cake knife from his pantry drawer . " I 've not had much use for this knife , " he admitted . " I can not seem to acquire the grace to bake a cake ! " He had noticed a forming of anticipatory moisture beneath his own tongue . " I think I 'll try just a small sample myself  --  while the coffee is boiling , " he explained . A chocolate cake  --  homemade  --  has power to stir the souls of boys  --  and men  --  who , in the presence of such glory , always become boys again . They ate their samples in silence . Bill Dunnigan was back again near Houston Street where his mother sometimes made him such a cake . Father Paul was in the little house in Scranton where anothermother also knew what would please a hungry lad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed it to William Dunnigan . Then cut a slice also for himself . The coffeewas ready and the cups filled , and very soon a third piece of Mary Spinsky 's cake was rapidly disappearing.  | " Ah-h ! " breathed Bill Dunnigan with a deep sigh . " Now , Father Paul , we have a real problem on our hands . " " What is that ? " asked the priest . " To find out who made this cake ! Among other unexpected adventurestoday , including my hearing your service , I 've become a partner in a quick-lunch business in Nanticoke ! I can not rest till 1 get the recipe of that cake for a friend of mine there ! " " The accompanying note mentioned a full cup of butter , six eggs and trouble . And as you deduced , there is another half somewhere in Coaltown tonight , " added Father Paul sagely . " I hope it 's not in the hands of a family of healthy men , " said Bill , " or it 's quite disappeared already . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a microscope to discover one crumb . We must make a house-to-house search quickly , Father , very quickly ! " And they both laughed . They went out presently to lock the church for the night . The druggist had just finished counting and sorting the money from the collection and the shrine boxes . Again it was nearly three hundred dollars . He departed taking the bills and silver to his store for safety . The priest extinguished some of the shrine candles . " I would like to leave them all burning , " he said , " but I fear it is it little dangerous . I would not want a fire at this time , or any time . I will pray for their intention at each shrine if you will wait for me . " " I 'll be out on the front steps , " said Bill . " Would I disgrace u , Father , by sitting on your church steps and maybe smoke ? " " I 'll come and sit with you presently , " said Father Paul , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , their knees hunched fore them  --  just two boys it seemed to both of them  --  Bill said : " I think the fellow who invented steps that face on a street did unkind a great service . I have n't sat this way for a long time . ' m realizing what I 've passed up , tearing around the country . " " I 've always loved to sit on steps , " said Father Paul . " I sit here ten . I know I have been criticized for doing it , but here one can meditate , as one should sometimes , above the world , and yet notfar above the world . Your fellow man is passing you  --  you can  --  his face  --  you are still one with him . " " It takes me back to a street on the East Side of New York , " said Bill . " At night in summer everyone sat on the steps or on the fire escapes . " " And you would sit there ? " " Not too often . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days ! I wanted to roam around . To see the world . Go way up to Fourteenth Street or over to the Bowery ! And there was a whole world right in front of me on Orchard Street , a world in one short block ! Morgenstern 's Fashion Center and next door O'Reilly 's Fish Market . A lawyer 's office was next to that  --  his name was Marcatto  --  then came the Great Textile Bargain House , James McNab , Sole Owner and Proprietor . Are you visualizing large emporiums , Father ? None of them was more than ten feet wide ! They were on the street floor of the tenement houses . And every house had a space of iron steps that ran down to the sidewalk . So step-sitting was born in my blood . I 've often wondered why I liked to sit a night on fire hydrants outside the theaters where I worked . Nowknow , Father . " " I 've always just wanted to stay in one place , " said Father Pa " With one church  --  one parish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this success at St. Michael 's is going to last ? " So Father Paul had also worried about that ! Bill Dunnigan bi hard on his cigar . " It 's got to last if that is what you want most , " he said . " But you will be going away soon , " said Father Paul , " and is you , my friend , who has made my church a crowded place . will be very lonely when you go . " " Father , " said Bill , " you and I are going to stick togeth You 're not alone any more . I 'm not alone either , as I 've be most of my life . It 's no good , being all alone . " There 's five of us going to see this through , Father  --  five musk eers  --  I was thinking this afternoon  --  and I do n't just mean this funeral --  " Five of us ? " asked Father Paul . " Yes , five . There 's a guy back in New York that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know yet about you . B just wait till I see him again ! Then there 's this girl . She 's dead . She 's going to help you . I know that , Father , though could not explain to you how I know it . " Someday I 'll tell you about this girl and myself . A chap249meeting  --  an almost absurd chance  --  I did not see her again for over a year  --  I did n't even know her name . Then another meeting for only a few hours . I could count on my fingers the times I have been near her alone . Then came an opportunity for her that I helped to realize . She accomplished something that I believe is great and good . Then death . Or what we call death . And my life with her really began  --  did not really begin until she died ! " Father Paul placed his hand on Bill Dunnigan 's arm . " I think I understand , " he said . " You loved her very deeply . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Bill , " and you know that I brought her to Coaltown in the casket that is supposed to be the end of all . " " There is no end of all , " said Father . Paul . They were both silent . Bill Dunnigan felt for a moment again a hand in his . On the side away from Father Paul . But just for a moment . It was gone before he could turn his head . " Then there are we three men battling shoulder to shoulder in Coaltown , " he continued at last , and lit a fresh cigar . " Three men ? " said Father Paul . " You and I and Saint Michael . All for one and one for all ! Maybe that 's sacrilegious or whatever the word is , but I do n't think so . I do n't really care if it is . " I wo n't be here all the time , of course . My work will take me to New York  --  to California . I guess Saint Michael had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I 'll return often and so will he . And you 're coming to New York sometimes . " " I have never been to New York , " said Father Paul . " Always when I had to figure how to make a show run , I 'd go out and sit on a fire hydrant in front of the theater . I 'm thinking now , Father  --  sitting in front of your church  --  about your show . I 'm thinking about that Mass every morning at five forty-five . That 's your big idea in this town . I think we 're going to bill ' this town about that Mass ! " " Bill ' this town ? " " You have n't any newspaper here . That makes it difficult . But suppose we have a newspaper ! Suppose twice a week we get out a sort of paper . Just one page , maybe , but regular newspaper size . So they 'll have to spread it out to read it . We 'll tell in it what you are doing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do.  | It wo n't cost much to print . Perhaps it should be in Polish . Polish and English both . Saint Michael 's Coaltown Clarion ! Published from the Front Steps of St. Michael 's Church ! " " I have always been afraid of newspapers , " said Father Paul . " So have I , " said Bill , " when I 've opened them the morning after a new show . But they are useful  --  sometimes . I 'm going to dope it out someway . I believe our partner back in New York will meet its cost for an advertisement about his motion pictures . And then I 'm going to print some window cards . " " Window cards ? " " That 's what we call them . About as large as that moon looks to be . Only square . We 'll print just one thing on them , in heavy type : DO N'T FORGET ! A MASS AT ST . MICHAEL'SAt Five Forty-fiveEVERY MORNING ! That 's our slogan , Father . Just that . I think the stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . Maybe even the bus company will help us out . A card in every bus . They have a silly idea that I 'm sort of a big shot . We 'll make use of it . That 's really the way I started in my promotion work for theaters . Going out with a bundle of cards under my arm , and putting them in store windows . I saved many a show that way . It will be fun to do it again for you ! " " You mean that you yourself will go around to all the stores ! " " All ten of them , " said Bill with a laugh . " And where else do people here congregate a lot ? " " In the saloons , " said Father Paul a little sadly . " Great ! Great ! " cried Bill . " It could n't be better ! I did n't think of that and I 've spent half my life in bars . Where were my brains ! We 'll put these cards in all the saloons ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " gasped Father Paul . " Listen , " said Bill , " I never met a saloonkeeper yet that was n't a sentimentalist , and I 've met hundreds of them . Thousands ! In every town in America . Coaltown ca n't be any different from the rest . We 'll ha'e our cards up right over the bars  --  cards with a picture of Saint Michael like the one in your office . That guy 's not afraid of saloons ! If the miners must go to the saloon beforep251they go to bed , they can come to your Mass before they go to work in the morning . I 'll have every bartender saying with each nightcapglass of beer  --  ' Going to St. Michael 's in the morning ? ' We got to make it the best attended early Mass in America ! Father Paul 's Mass for Miners ! I 'll see the head of their Union . We 'll even put cards in that damn Breaker ! I 'll tack some myself on the outside of it ! You and Saint Michael and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to know we are around ! " They sat awhile in silence , listening to the bells , and to the crickets and locusts that were chanting a chorus beneath the bells and the rumble of the Breaker farther down the street . Two men who felt a great comradeship of spirit . Two men who wanted only to accomplish good . Perhaps there was a third one there , also , who determined to take a hand . Saint Michael the Fighting Archangel might have been sitting on those steps , his hands clasped about his steel shingreaves , making plans . Who could say he was not ? Back in his room at the ' Wyoming Hotel , Bill Dunnigan placed Iwo packages on his bureau which the clerk had handed him . One , plainly marked " Frank Brothers , New York , " he knew contained a supply of the beloved spats . He could now stride the streets of Coaltown properly clothed  --  attend the early Mass the next morning in fitting style ! But it was the note , inserted under the string which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was written on ruled paper torn from a tablet . It read : Mr. Dunnigan , Sir : I am the sister of Father Spinsky of St. Leo 's . Today I made him a cake using six best eggs and a full cup of butter . My brother has insisted that I send half to Father Paul at St. Michael 's and half to you . I am carrying out my brother 's request . Sincerely , Mary Spinsky . " I 'll be damned ! " said Bill Dunnigan . He had no knife and tried to unfasten the stout cord with which the box was tied . No use . Mary Spinsky was a firm woman and tied a firm knot . At last he managed to slip the cord over the sides . Removing the cover , there indeed was the superb missing half of Father Paul 's cake in all the splendid magnificence of its six eggs , its cup of butter , its generous chocolate . First his altar candles , then a cake made especially for Father Spinsky 's enjoyment and sent ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less worthy palates . Father Paul had called it the acid test of unselfishness ! What had happened to Father Spinsky ! Was it guile or repent-ance ? Sniffing and viewing again such a culinary masterpiece , Bill Dunnigan did not really care . From St. Leo 's , deep-dyed schemes might be plodding afoot or high-born reformation might be soaring overhead ! The important thing was to win over Mary Spinsky and her chocolate cake recipe ! Perhaps this Saint Leo of Father Spinsky 's was a regular guy also , and worthy a place in Quick Lunch Heaven ! The St. Leo Chocolate Cake ! Could his young boy friend think up a slogan around that name ! Since Father Paul had shared his half with him , Bill Dunnigan felt honor bound to do the same . He would carry the cake to the parish house the next day . But he felt a great longing for just another taste , and there was an experiment he wished to carry out . He had not yet seen the sober face of the Wyoming Hotel clerk relax into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . He walked to the speaking tube and pressed the button that connected that tube with the desk in the lobby . " Can you leave your duties for a few minutes and come up to my room with a knife ? " he said to the answering " Yes , sir . " " With a knife ! " came the clerk 's surprised voice . There seemed to he alarm in its tone . " Yes , a knife , " said Mr. Dunnigan grimly . " The largest , sharpest knife you have ! " " Is everything all right with you , sir ? " came the voice . " Everything will be quite all right  --  when you and your knife are here . " " I have no knife , sir , and the pantry is locked for the night . I have a pair of scissors . "  | " Is the blade a long one ? " " They are quite large scissors , sir . " " We will have to make them do . Come quickly . " By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and donned his long dressing gown . He stood by the cake box like a high priest at the sacrificial altar . The clerk knocked  --  then entered warily . He held a pair of formidable office shears in his hand , but did not immediately offer them to the guest of A-i . " Well ? " said Dunnigan sternly . " Mr. Dunnigan , " said the clerk , " I must ask you what you wish to do with these scissors at this hour of night . " " That is my business , " said Bill Dunnigan . " Undoubtedly , sir , but I feel that I must ask you . " " Why ? " " I have had two very unfortunate experiences with gentlemen guests who sent for knives , sir . " " Really ! What experiences ? " " One of them  --  he wore a dressing gown not unlike yours , sir  --  wished to attempt suicide . He had been here a week and was a salesman for the Encyclopaedia Britannica . " " And the other case ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The gentleman asked for scissors , so I had no inkling of criminal motives . You see , he had lowered his window blind and was not able to raise it before retiring . He seized the scissors  --  they were the same ones I now have brought  --  and jumping onto a chair and before I was able to prevent it , cut the linen of the blind straight across the top ! " Dunnigan regarded the bleak , austere individual before him . " Tell me , " he said , " have you ever smiled ? " " Why , yes , sir , I believe I have , sir , " said the clerk doubtfully . He still held tightly to his cutting tool of tragic memories . " Would you smile , " asked Bill , " if I gave you a sight and taste ofsomething that would penetrate your very gizzard with happiness ! " The clerk shuddered . " Why , I suppose I would , sir , " he said . " Very well . Give me your scissors . I promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am about to cut youa slice of Paradise that will restore your youth ! " He motioned the clerk to look inside the box on his bureau.  |p254And  solemnly , using the largest blade of the scissors , he cut two small slices of the treasure within , and passed one to his guest . " I 'm sorry to be so stingy about the portions , " said Dunnigan , " I 'm obligated to save most of it for a friend of mine . " The clerk cautiously bit into the piece of gold and chocolate he held in his hand . He paused as its taste struck his palate . He swallowed the bite . The reflection of a great inner struggle tensed the muscles of the countenance that always was conscious of its resemblance to the sedate physiognomy of our greatest mass-producer of automobiles . " I 'm afraid  --  I 'm afraid I 'll have to smile , sir , " it said and did . Even Mary Spinsky was spreading joy in Coaltown ! DILL DUNNIGAN had gone to sleep with the strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball . But it seemed that Saint Michael thought otherwise  --  Saint Michael and an Ally even more powerful , no less than the Blessed Virgin Mother herself ! For that night was the night of the miracle . Bill 's thoughts had focused on the five forty-five Mass . Ideas about this Mass flocked to his mind as he passed into slumber . That Mass was Father Paul 's unique idea . That Mass set his church apart from the others . Unless they also adopted it , there was no reason why it should not draw an " audience " from all the Coaltown parishes . " Father Paul 's Mass for Miners "  --  all miners  --  before they started their dangerous work each day ! So reasoned the press agent , and he must try to " organize " this Mass . It had been laughed at , neglected ! Father Spinsky even said it had brought discredit on the whole Church body ! Very well , it must he made to be the most successful religious service in the town ! The shining glory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that became a corner stone  --  there was a line like that in some play  --  a line out of the Bible . A service the fame of which would spread beyond the town ! The Miners ' Union  --  that was it . Bill was a union man . Hisp255trade of theatrical press agent had a very strong organization . He must find out the " powers " in the Coaltown workers ' Union and talk to them as one union man to another . Father Paul had plans for bettering their working conditions , helping their home life . The only Coaltown cleric who ardently wished to do something for them . Let them help Father Paul ! Make him the official Chaplain of the Union ! Just like in a regiment . And there would be a certainnumber of the men who would attend the Mass each morning . Fifty  --  a hundred  --  to take turns representing their fellows . Once a month an attendance of seven or eight hundred to completely fill St. Michael 's . They would come , of course , in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the electric lights at the front . On the clay that they came in a body they would gather at headquarters and march to St. Michael 's with these cap-lights burning . It would almost be as if they carried candles . The candles of the workers ! What a sight in the half light of winter dawns ! He could land that picture in every rotogravure newspaper section in America ! Saint Michael 's Miners ! Father Paul 's Miners ! And perhaps there would be some place in the Mass  --  in the church service  --  where they could hold these caps before them  --  over their hearts  --  and suddenly have all the little bulbs blaze out in answer to the altar lights . What Bill could do with that picture and that story ! Let Father Spinsky and his grand organ be a friend of the mine owners . Father Paul and Saint Michael would take on the workers and make a " production " Flo Ziegfeld or Charlie Dillingham would have been proud to have created ! Bill Dunnigan only hoped the attendance at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of his big ideas into working order . He hoped there would be more than a scattered few the next morning , that the two services of the day just passed had not exhausted the present Coaltown interest . He need not have been fearful of that astounding morning . We have noted that at each side of the altar rail of Father Paul 's church were two statues . Along with the screen that formed the altar backing , these statues were the glory of that modest house of God . They stood inside the altar rail , were somewhat larger than life-size  --  were of heroic size , in fact  --  and almost too large for so small a church . They were very old , possibly dating back several hundred years , and beautifully carved from pure white marble . They had been brought from Poland thirty years before by one of the early Polish priests . One statue was of Saint Michael and the other that of the Blessed Virgin and her Man-Child . Saint Michael was sculptured in full armor , his sword ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the defeated Satan . On his face was the triumph of the conquering warrior . Across the way , the Blessed Mother held her Child in her arms and on her countenance was a gentle , elusive smile which made the stone Madonna seem almost flesh and blood . Father Paul loved these statues . They seemed to him to typify two basic principles of his religion : the spirit of endeavor , the spirit of love . Both statues , being very heavy , were firmly attached to bases going down through the floor into the foundations of the building , and both were set squarely so that they looked straight out into the body of the church . It was two of his altar boys arriving for the early Mass on this second morning who brought the startling news to Father Paul  --  bursting breathless and wide-eyed into his upstairs bedroom as the priest was donning his cassock to come for the service . " The altar statues ! " they both gasped at once , " Saint Michael and the Madonna ! " The priest misinterpreted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No one has injured the statues ! " he cried in considerableperturbation . " No ! No ! " shouted one of the boys , and the other crossed himself . " They are moved ! " cried this lad , and the other broke in : " Yes , Father , they are moved ! They are not like they have always been ! Come and see ! " " What are you two trying to say ? " asked Father Paul . " You mean someone has taken them ! But that is impossible ! " " No ! They are both there ! " The boys were again speaking at once and their excitement was so intense that the priest broke in . " One at a time ! " he said . " You , Thomas , tell me just what you are both talking about . "  |p257The  older boy again crossed himself fervently . " Both statues have turned ! " he cried . " Turned ? " repeated Father Paul . Again there was apprehension in his question . " They do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the coffin of the dead girl ! " And the lads waited , open-mouthed , for the effect of this astonishingannouncement . Father Paul regained his calmness . His statues were not harmed . No fanatical vandal had mutilated them . As for their being " turned , " they were firmly cemented to concrete pillars that ran down through the church basement and into the ground . Their great weight had made that necessary , and whoever had first placed them had taken care to see that there could be no danger of their toppling and the precious marble suffering injury . Father Paul had long since tested the solidity of their attachment to the bases . It was one of the first inspections he had made on taking over the church three years before . " I think you must be mistaken , " he said quietly . " The bells and the unusual crowds in our church are making you imagine things . " " We are not the only ones who noticed it ! " reiterated the older boy , and the other broke in : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relieve him at the bell rope , saw it first ! " " The sexton has already opened the church doors for some who were waiting like yesterday , and a lot of people are inside ! " continuedthe other lad . " They say it is a miracle ! They are all on their knees in the aisles ! For God 's sake , come quick , Father ! " Fully dressed by now , Father Paul followed the excited altar boys . " Come to the front door ! " cried one of them as soon as they were outside . " You can see it plainly from the front part of the church ! " Father Paul permitted himself to be guided by the straining lads and paced after them . They went by the grass lawn down the parish house side of St. Michael 's and entered by the open front doors . As they entered two excited women were dashing out . " A miracle ! Father ! A blessed miracle ! " one cried . And the other , " The dead girl must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my son to come and see ! " " Peace , my children , peace , " said the priest . " There can be no miracle . Some foolish person has started this story and you must all be dreaming quite impossible things . Perhaps the early morning light through one of the windows  --  " But he was addressing the morning air . The two women had rushed down the steps and one was talking excitedly to a group of miners passing the church on the way home from the Breaker night shift . The other woman was spreading the news along the roadway to all she met . Coaltown 's Main Street was not empty at that hour of sunrise  --  there were men both coming and going to their work , and meals were being prepared behind every lighted kitchen window . Such part of Coaltown as did not work at night arose at five for the day shifts . By this time the altar boys had seized Father Paul 's hand and dragged him through the wide doors . Like the two women , they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul stood still at the end of his center aisle and looked . There was no doubt about it ! The two statues had turned ever so slightly , but enough so that the face of Saint Michael and the face of the Holy Mother were not directed straight ahead , but at an angle toward this center aisle , at the exact point where stood the coffin of Olga Treskovna ! Saint Michael 's triumph was for her alone . The compassionate smile of the Madonna rested on the dead girl . " You see , Father ! " said one lad in an awed whisper , and the other boy had knelt and was repeating , " A miracle ! A miracle ! " But the emotion that swept Father Paul was neither awe nor reverence nor amazement . It was sheer alarm . One of his greatest worries had been the slight but noticeable sinking of one side of the church foundations during the past year . It was , he knew , because of the mine shafts below . Houses in Coaltownhad been known gradually to sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that burrowed beneath the whole town . Occasionally a building would collapse . Father Paul had long ago consulted one of the mining company 's foreman engineers who was a member of his parish , and had been assured that in the case underground . It was only shafts nearer the surface that brought on sudden disaster.  |p259Still  , the matter had been a source of anxiety , for even if the undermining simply cracked a foundation side wall or an entrance step , it would mean money that was not at hand for repairs . Father Paul turned quickly . His way down through the church aisles was already blocked by a hundred or more worshipers who had been waiting for the doors to open for the Mass and who were now , as the altar boys reported , kneeling on the church floor and either praying or gazing in rapt adoration at the holy statues . They were crowded toward the rear of the church as if fearful of approachingtoo closely this new wonder . So the priest rushed out as he had entered , brushing past a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were flocking into the church doors . He hastened to the rear entrance door behind his altar . Orderingthe altar boys , who had followed him , to wait in their room there , he descended alone to the basement of his church . The priest switched on the cluster of three electric bulbs in its ceiling . There was also a certain amount of light from the shallow windows along the strip of foundation wall above ground . The room was bare except for a stored table , a broken pew , some paint cans and garden tools in one corner . The low ceiling was beamed with solid , unfinished rafters which supported the floor of the church above . It was toward the two sturdy and square-built , brick-and-concrete pillars which disappeared through the ceiling to support his statues that Father Paul directed his attention . It was as he had thought . The pillars themselves were very slightly turned . There was a small crack and a rounded bulge in the concrete flooring near one of them which extended across toward the other pillar . Some shifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had undoubtedly occurred . There was nothing miraculous except that this shifting had caused both statues to look toward the center aisle and hence toward the coffin of Olga Treskovna ! The priest had been on both knees by one of the pillars to better examine the telltale crack and bulge in the floor . Thank God the pillars were solidly intact ! He had inspected them on all sides on first lighting the room . The statues were not in danger ! Father Paul sighed with relief . And he knew what he must do immediately . He must hasten up and explain all this as best he could to the people in the church above  --  and to those who were coming in . Stop at once this talk of miracles and Holy Child , this hysteria be fore it got out of hand ! " I must hurry ! " he said aloud to himself , " Thank God I know what has happened ! " " Wait , Father ! " said a voice beside him . " Father Paul , please lei me have a word with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been Saint Michael himself ! It might have been some other Saint sent by Heaven , as the Voices were sent to Joan of Arc ! It was neither of these . It was a Broadway press agent in new , spotless white spats , and a black derby at a rakish angle , who stood beside the priest . It was , of course , Bill ( White Spats ) Dunnigan . Bill had decided the night before to attend Father Paul 's early Mass on this morning . He must get that Mass " under his belt " if he was to publicize it  --  make it the key factor of a campaign for Si . Michael 's . Also , he would be one more worshiper if there was to be any falling away of the patronage given it the day before . Maybe he could now sit through a service without a hankering to smoke ! And he had not forgotten that his young friend of the Nanticoke Quick Lunch would be there with his girl , and that he was expected to meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for four forty-five , A.M. and had experienced the questionable thrill of the Wyoming Hotel clerk 's alarm s  --  ; stem . And although , not entirely awake , he had taken at least four minutes to find either the light cord hanging from the center of the ceiling or the speaking tube by the door to silence the alarm , and despite the fact that getting up at the crack of dawn was not exactly his life habit , the press agent was far from being in an ill humor as he shaved and dressed . The untiring bells . ere ringing on . Were their ringers and re.  |p261lief  ringers as untiring ? Bill made a mental note that he must visit all the bell towers and distribute some sort of bonus to these faithful , unseen collaborators . They were like the behind-the-scene stagehands of a theater production and quite as necessary ! Then he must go to Wilkes-Barre or Scranton and get a blanket of roses made up for Olga Treskovna 's coffin . Also , he had forgotten to speak to Father Paul about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning Mass . He must tell the reporters about it , some of whom were still there , having registered at the Wyoming Hotel , and perhaps be would himself telephone the near-by city newspapers . His own press campaign was moving of its own momentum , since every inhabitant of Coaltown was eager and willing to talk exhaustivelyof the late Olga Trocki  --  " the Breaker Girl "  --  stage name Olga Treskovna . Yes , all up to this moment was well and good . The jinx seemed to have departed with the Brooklyn bankbook . Best of all for his morale , six pairs of immaculate white spats lay on his bureau . " Dunnigan ca n't work properly without them ! " Marcus Harris had commented in New York when he had instructed Miss Feinberg to see personally to their dispatch . They did make a **29;1638;TOOLONG just before descending to the lobby Bill looked from his front window . There seemed to be unusual activity on the street below , although it was barely daylight ! Groups of miners were pausing , talking , pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that people were already going into the church . This early Mass had surely caught on ! But there was something in the air that seemed to go beyond a mere church service . There was a new , hushed excitement in the mingled voices that reached him from the street . Bill Dunnigan hastily put on his coat and hat and descendedthe hotel stairs . His friend , the cake-loving clerk , called the news from his receptioncounter . " I was just coining up to tell you , " he said . " Something 's happened at St. Michael 's church . I first heard of it at five-fifteen and one quarter . There 's a lot of fuss and hubbub on the street about their big statues . I do n't take much stock in religious doings , but everyone is talking about some sort of miracle . "  | " A miracle ! " exclaimed Dunnigan . Like Father Paul he felt a sudden chilling alarm . His anxiety was for the safety of the coffinof Olga Treskovna . " I do n't know what it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called you exactly at four forty-five on the dot , sir . That chocolate cake of yours was certainly top-notch , sir  --  I found myself smiling again at three-ten A.M. , , But Dunnigan had left this gentleman whose interest in miracles would only have been aroused had his electrically controlled clock suddenly stopped or gone berserk and whirled its hands in reverse around its dial ! The press agent rushed to the street . The rest of Coaltown was not hearing events with such indifference ! A fuss and hubbub indeed ! The first groups just beyond the door were speaking Polish and Dunnigan could not understand the words cried to him or whispered among themselves from excitement-loosedor awe-tightened lips . But a few yards farther along English words were being hurled from mouth to mouth . " A miracle at St. Michael 's ! " " The holy statues are looking toward the coffin ! " " The Trocki girl must also he a Saint ! " And a woman rushed past crying : " I have seen a miracle ! We should all be on our knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two nights before Bill Dunnigan had observed on this same street the mounting interest and agitation caused by his bell ringing . Observed it with the calm and detached mind of the expert publicist that he was . It had been his life business to stir people up ! He had simply accomplished it again . The means , not the results , were to him the novelty of that situation . He had neverbefore rung church bells ! But now something was taking place that he certainly had not instigated , something beyond his calculation and control , that was spreading a tumult of emotion quite different from the curiosity , the animal excitement of the evening when the bells had started . For the story of this " miracle " was sweeping like a prairie fire , and no holocaust of leaping flame could have more rapidly emptied the homes and filled the street with men and women and children . The inhabitants of Coaltown were almost entirely Catholic . The Faith had been born in the marrow of their bones , for it had beenp 263 bred there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a tuberculosis of indifference , but it was there . The Communion of Saints was real to them  --  the statues which representedthe canonized Saints in their churches were not mere legends . They were potent and alive . The inhabitants of Coaltown were predominantly Slavic  --  deeply emotional when really stirred . And now , in all faces , was an agitation of something more than curiosity . It seemed to Dunnigan that these faces were like so many lamps whose fuel had nearly burnt out and now were suddenly supplied with new , lifegiving oil . In every voice was a tone ofquivering elation . They would shout or whisper hoarsely to each other , then push on toward St. Michael 's church . Bill Dunnigan hastened forward at top speed . Though subconsciouslysensing the tremendous news value of what had apparentlyoccurred , he did not smile . His face was tense and grave . What was this turmoil doing to Father Paul ? Did the priest even know of it yet ? Bill managed to reach the space in the street before St. Michael 's , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already filled the roadway and the steps leading up to the structure . He pushed his way through the miners , the housewives , and dashed up the narrow parish house steps and down the lawn to the side door ofthe church . The two altar boys were there and several others , dressed for the early Mass , and talking in low , tense whispers . " Where is Father Paul ? " cried Dunnigan . " He is in the lower basement , but said no one must come down ! " replied one of the boys . " He says it is no miracle ! " said one of the lads who had arousedthe Father . " But I have seen it myself ! The Holy Statues are turned ! " " I must find him ! " gasped Dunnigan and plunged through the rear church door by which he and Father Paul had entered the evening before . There was a stairway leading downward to a lighted space and Bill took it two steps at a time . A short passage and he was in the basement room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around one of the statuesupportingpillars . Bill Dunnigan 's quick mind grasped the meaning of this inspection.  | " You have heard ? " said Father Paul when he recognized the voice at his side . And he gathered the skirts of his cassock and stood up from the floor of his basement . Dunnigan said : " I have heard . I have not seen the statues . It is impossible now to get inside your church from the front . But I have seen the crowd outside and the people who are still gathering there . I know what they say has happened . " " It is extremely unfortunate that such a thing should occur at this time . It is terrible ! " said Father Paul . Grim concern looked from his troubled eyes . " Why ? " asked Bill Dunnigan . " Why do you say this miracle is terrible ? " The press agent was by now acutely aware of the amazing possibilities of this astonishing event . Possibilities of an undreamed-of publicity for Olga Treskovna , for her film , " The Garden of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archangel , for Father Paull It was so stupendous it was a little frightening . But how could it be terrible ? How could it bring anything but good ? Father Paul was answering his blunt " Why ? " " There has been no miracle . " " But these people --  " The people have become unduly excited by the ringing of the bells . In that , I had convinced myself , there was no harm . They needed , perhaps , to be stirred from their apathy toward the church . But that they should now believe that by some divine act our statues have turned their faces to look toward the coffin of a mortal who has died  --  that they should believe a sacred miracle has oc-curred ! " The priest paused . There was acute distress in his face , but his lips were very firm . " I feared that you were thinking that way , " said Bill . " When I found you in this basement examining these pillars , I feared just that . What are you now going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth , " said Father Paul simply , and moved to leave the lower room . " Wait , Father , please wait , " repeated Bill Dunnigan . And he placed his hands on the shoulders of the little priest , as he had placed them at the cemetery that first evening , only now their grasp was very gentle.  | " My friend , my very dear friend , " he said , " are you sure that you know what is the truth ? " " Certainly . My church is above mine shafts far under ground . There has been some slight movement of the soil  --  enough to tilt and turn these foundation pillars a fraction of a degree . So the statues also had to turn . You can see it plainly here . " And Father Paul knelt again on the floor and pointed out to Dunnigan the crevice there and the bulging concrete . " Is it not a miracle that it should happen just at this time  --  and to both statues ? " " A coincidence . Not a miracle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you make this physical fact known ? I know you are the soul of honesty , Father , but " Father Paul placed his hand on the arm of his friend . " It is not a question of my personal honesty . The Catholic hierarchy instructsus to give no recognition to so-called miraculous happenings , unless they are so proven by long and exhaustive investigation . I needed no investigation . I knew the cause at once . I must not remain silent . " Once more Bill Dunnigan was fighting for his chance , but this time it was free of self-interest . It was for St. Michael 's , for Olga Treskovna , for Father Paul himself ! And it was motivated by another burning urge . He did not agree with Father Paul about the miracle ! " Before you speak to them , Father , may I tell you of a play I once worked for ? " he asked . " Tell of it quickly then , for my Mass is almost clue and I must first address the people and end this foolish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The play was called False Gods ' and was by some famous French writer . I never could pronounce his name ! It was set in ancient Egypt , and about a young priest of their religion , who realized that the river Nile was not sacred ; that the animals  --  the jackal and the bull  --  were not sacred ; and being honest  --  and very young  --  he wanted to tell his people what he called ' the truth . ' " And there was a scene with an old , very wise priest , to whom the young student rushed with what he thought were his momentous discoveries . And the old priest said : ' You are telling me nothing we older priests have not known for centuries , if we chose to look at it that way . But it is best the people believe the Nile is sacred or they would pollute it , and we would have disease . It is best the people believe the jackal sacred , for he is our best scavenger . He must not be exterminated . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be held inviolate and not killed . ' " " But what has that to do with this so-called miracle ? " asked Father Paul . " I am coming to that , " replied Bill . " This young priest also thought he had discovered that we do not live again in this mortal body  --  that careful embalming for a future life was all a fraud . And in spite of the older priest he insisted on preaching his ' discoveries . ' Did he help his people with his ' truth ' ? He destroyed their faith  --  their hope of meeting loved ones after death . He took away their only real hope of happiness . They finally killed him . " " I do not think I will be killed by my parishioners if 1 tell them the truth about this turning of our statues , " said Father Paul with a little smile . " But they will not thank you , " said Bill . " 1 do not think they will even believe you ! And if they do believe you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The miracles of the scriptures , of later centuries even , were a need of their times . Faith , now , is a matter of the inner mind , the inner heart . It is born in us . ' We need no outer signs . " " Do n't we ? " asked Bill Dunnigan and he held the priest with the sharp sincerity of his voice . " Are you quite certain of that , Father Paul ? " " What do you mean ? " said Father Paul . The pulsing earnestness of Bill Dunnigan could not be brushed aside . Compared with that earnestness , his own argument sounded like something in a printed book . " I mean this , " said the press agent , " I found this town a deadly place ; except for you , Father , filled with selfish , cruel people  --  either that or people with lead in their hearts and glue in their minds and souls . ' Their eyes did not see . They were a hundred times more blind than your blind organist ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  dull , without hope , without joy . There was a change yesterday . The bells did that . If not joy , there was at least an awakening interest  --  something besides just to struggle for money , then eat , drink , breed , sleep ! And as I rushed here thisp267morning there is  --  mother change -- a hope , a glow , a living flame in the faces  --  in the eyes turning toward St. Michael 's ! " Go up and look at the people now in your church  --  at the crowd standing outside ! There are hundreds there ! The whole town is there by now . Some through mere curiosity , I realize ; some are there who will scoff ; but most . of these men and women have literally been born again . That is the church phrase for it , is n't it , Father ? For the first time since they were born , they live ! They see ! I do n't know about your religion , but : f would say that many of them have this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I would not hastily destroy that new faith , Father , if I were you . " " But they are saying the dead girl  --  your friend  --  must be a holy child  --  even a Saint ! " " Who knows ? " said Bill .. " Perhaps she was ! Are you to judge of that  --  or I ? As I told you , I did not really know her so very well , Father . But I can tell you this  --  she did nothing in her short life that would bar her from saintliness . She lived clean . She was kind . She was loyal . She was humble . She only wanted desperately to give the world some beauty  --  some happiness . She was not bitter and yet she had received from the world only ugly things  --  poverty , loneliness , frustration . Maybe it was meant that with death she could give what she was not able to give as a living mortal . There is the makings of saintliness in all that , is there not ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he looked at Bill Dunnigan as if he had never seen him before . " Are you sincere in what you are telling me ? " Bill Dunnigan reached for a cigar . In so doing he realized the incongruity of his situation . Here was he , a man of no religious knowledge or belief , trying to expound faith to a man of God ! But his inner convictions about what had happened were very clear , were very real . He continued to speak . He did not light his cigar . He held it tightly between his fingers . The presence of this very material link with his everyday life seemed to make even more real these events that bordered on the supernatural . " I am what is known as a theatrical press agent , " he said to the priest . " I am myself that man I told you that I knew . I had no religion . I have none yet , I suppose . I came here with a simple purpose ; to bury my friend as she wished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your cemetery and heard your Angelus ; when I started these funeral bells with the idea of attract  --  ing attention to a motion picture this girl had just finished making . " But even then , Father , it was n't entirely a selfish idea . Yes , I did want back a job I 'd Iost . I did want to put over , as we say , my big stunt . But at the same time I wanted to do something for this girl ; to make her great work , which was going to die with her , live . And I had met you , Father , and knew you , and wanted honestly to do something for you and for your church and your Saint Michael . I took a great fancy to that guy ! I seemed to know him right off . I became your pal  --  and his , I hope . " Well , we rang the bells . The crowds came . The reporters came . and the newspapers fell for it . I stopped worrying about that mo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church . What could I do for it ? You were worrying also . Would the success of your Masses last ? Now we 've been given a break I never could have imagined in my wildest press-agent dreams ! Would we have gotten that break if my motives were entirely selfish and bad ? This ' miracle '  --  and who knows but that it is a miracle  --  will flash acrothe continent ! It will be mentioned in newspapers tomorrow fro London to Shanghai . It will leap across oceans . As a vendor o news stories I know that . It has already started . Neither you nor can stop this story  --  if we call it a ' story . ' " But is it just a story ? Think , Father . The other churches have mine shafts beneath them . Did their statues ever turn ? You church has been over mine shafts for years . Did its statues turn b fore ? Do n't destroy what can hurt no one  --  what can only bring new hope to a world that needs a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will not believe ? Those who ma even cry fraud ? " " Let them not believe ! At least , in the face of this , they cann. remain indifferent . Indifference is death . I want your Saint Michael to live . I want you and your little church to live . 1 wan that now , just as much as I ever wanted the film play this girl mad in Hollywood to live . So let some shout , ' There is no miracle ! We , who know , can answer that . " " We who know ? " said Father Paul . " I 'll tell you one thing more , Father . I did not mean to ever tell you . When I bargained to have the bells rung for four days I too a desperate chance . I had no money to pay for them . I did nop269know if I could get the money . I sent a telegram about it after the bells had started . Sent it with my last dollar . And I prayed , Father . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me . I prayed to your Saint Michael . For I 'd met him . Met him through you . And as I stand in this room , I believe Saint Michael helped me get that money ! " So , as true as I stand here , I believe there has been a miracle . I told you last night there were five of us . You and I , the girl and Saint Michael  --  and a man you do n't know yet . I believe Olga Treskovna has not died , though some part of her is in that coffin above us in your church . I believe Saint Michael , our pad Saint Michael , turned those statues , though you show me a thousand cracks in your basement floor ! Are you still worried about the success of your Masses ? Saint Michael has knocked that worry in the head ! It 's out for the count of tent Good God ! What you and I can now do for him , and for your church ! Are we going to let Saint Michael down ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cigar between strong teeth . He bit into its end . He spat out that end . He produced a match and struck it vigorously on the pillar that supported the statue of the fighting Saint in the church above him . He would have struck that snatch on the very side of God 's throne , had he been defending a deed of Saint Michael 's to the Great Commander . And through the smoke clouds , Father Paul stared into the eyes of this mars from another world . The man was sincere . The man was honest . In plain words he had told what the priest had suspected , not concealing selfish motives . This stranger to the Church saw the cracks in the floor , he had heard the explanation , and yet , he believed ! And even if he , the ordained priest , could not believe that a miracle had taken place , was some great good to spring from all of it ! " I do not know  --  I truly do not know what I should do ! " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wait at least till you have seen your people , wait till after your Mass , " said Bill Dunnigan . " I must wait now , " said Father Paul , " for I am already late in starting it . " P270THAT SECOND morning 's early Mass at St. Michael 's  --  the second since the arrival of Bill ( White Spats ) Dunnigan , and destined to become known as the " Mass of the Miracle "  --  was held in an atmosphere charged with dynamic expectancy . When the agitated Father Paul at last entered the sanctuary before his altar , one could feel the straining tension as well as hear the " Oh-h " of the intake of breath from worshipers jammed into every niche of the building . They had even found their way to the choir loft which reminded Dunnigan of a sort of first balcony . The press agent stood in a doorway leading into the sanctuary . He could see but was not seen . He was in the wings , as it were , of the stage of this consecrated theater . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hushed fervency . And this tense excitation extended through its walls and out of the open doors , onto the lawn about the building ; onto the steps and the street before it . That street was completely blocked for yards in each direction . All Coaltown had now heard , and had risen and come to marvel . During the past hour , even the bells had seemed to cry , " A Miracle ! A Miracle ! " Over it all was the seemingly endless tolling of the bells . And this great crowd somehow knew the instant the little priest entered the sanctuary , as Christ whom he represented , entered the Garden of Olives ; stood at the foot of the altar ; and made the sign of the cross ; for those outside as well as in , crossed themselves , and many knelt , even in the roadway , as the words of . Holy Mass began : " In the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost . Amen . " Father Paul 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had forced a calmness as he faced the altar and commencedthe Mass , though he had said to himself , " I will go on as if nothing had happened , " he could not help but feel the surge of that new lifeblood in the throng behind him . Even thoughp273Come to her bier , ye Saints of God ! Meet her , ye Angels of the Lord . Receive her soul and present it to the most high God . Let perpetual light shine upon her . And having repeated this prayer , Father Paul moved again to his altar , wrapped his vestment about the covered chalice and other articles used in the sacrifice , and made his exit from the sanctuary as the organist played a lovely toccata of Bach . In the passageway he paused a moment before the questioning eyes of William Dunnigan . " I have said nothing , God help me , " he spoke to his waiting friend , " but I am sorely troubled . I do not know if I have committeda very great sin or conferred a greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a little joy . Not all this . This frightens me . " Dunnigan was startled . They were the exact words of Olga Tres , kovna . But he could not say to Father Paul . " Hush ! hush ! Just let me handle it , kid ! " Nevertheless , he felt that it would be handled . He felt that behind this simple man of God was gathering an army with banners flying and swords flashing . And though this army wore the armor of a thousand Saint Michaels and carried shields of shining bronze , their helmets were miners ' caps with the light-fixturesat the front , and there were tin lunch pails at their belts . " I am going to my room to pray for guidance , " continued Father Paul . He replaced the chalice in a cabinet , then moved , as Olga Treskovna had moved , into the open yard between the church and the parish house . The priest could not , however , remain entirely silent ; could not escape , on the few yards across his lawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the half-dozen newspapermen who had remained all night in Coaltown and were already on the scene . The townspeople parted respectfully to make a path for him , but the reporters pressed forward and were not silent . " Is it true a miracle has occurred ? " " Are both statues turned toward the coffin of the girl ? " " If this has happened , what does it mean ? " " Do you believe this dead actress to be some sort of saint , as your people arc saying ? "  | And again the troubled Father Paul was on the point of speaking out the " truth , " of telling the newsmen about the mine shafts and the " reason " for the turning of the statues . He imagined that he discerned in some of their voices a cynical challenge  --  a feeling on their part that he would break into some sanctimonious pronouncementsof divine grace and show of power . How conclusively he could answer them , how surprised they would be if he flung back their questions with a brutal , matter-of-fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw over their shoulders the eager , passionate faces of his parishioners , his people . What of them ? They would not have torn him apart as happened to the student in William Dunnigan 's Egyptian play , had he so spoken , but those faces would have changed to something akin to horror  --  they would have thought his words a dreadful sacrilege  --  thought him a Judas to his faith , a denier of the power of the God he preached , and in whom he asked them daily to believe . Along with this , a dreadful doubt of all faith might enter their hearts ! He replied to the interrogations of the newsmen : " The statues are turned . They are far too heavy and too solidly implanted to have been turned by human hands . As for the why , the wherefore , I do not know the meanings . Nor does any man . The matter will be investigated . Then only can we say . The Church does not recognize any so-called miracle without such an investigation . " Thus spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped concealedthe turmoil of his soul . Just before entering his parish house he paused and looked out at . the great throng that covered his grass plot -- his flower bed too , alas  --  and beyond to the sea of faces in the sunken roadway and across the street . Though his Mass was over , they were making no movement to leave ; there was instead a pressing toward the church from whose doors some of those who had been inside were coming out . And in all faces , in the movement of their shoulders even , was the reflection of the living flame that was newly burning within them , the flame that Dunnigan had noted . St. Michael 's was not just a building with a cross at its top  --  it was a symbol of God 's presence on this earth  --  a shelter of Something God Himself had reached down and touched . Could a whole believing town be told : " The day of miracles isp275over ! We need no outer signs . I , your priest , tell you so . I , Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Just what , indeed , did he believe ? FATHER PAUL might doubt and hesitate ; the church authorities might  --  or might not  --  in months to come , debate and argue and listen to evidence ; but the people of Coaltown made a decision then and there . And it was the people of Coaltown who answered the telephone calls from near-by towns and talked now to reporters and radio announcers ; the people who , if they were not in the street before St. Michael 's pressing to gain admission , were gathered on every corner and porch and doorstep , and in every store and saloon . Coaltown had no police force equal to regulating such an unusual throng . It did possess two uniformed officers of the law who spent most of their time in Orloff 's poolroom . Their duties consisted mainly of stopping an occasional brawl in the saloons , or seeing that a car with a blowout did not block the roadway . These officers had appeared at about the time the Mass was finished , but stood gaping and wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busier than usual since the bells had started , seeing that alien cars were not parked so as to obstruct the " traffic " on Main Street . That was within their organizing ability . But such an outpouring as had now occurred was beyond their capability . Besides , it was no business of theirs to interfere with " miracles . " Coaltown was under the jurisdiction of the County . In the town , itself , there was a " Squire , " duly elected , who , two clays of each week and more often if necessary , held a sort of court in the " law office " he maintained in the front room of his Main Street dwelling . He notarized documents , settled small disputes . Any larger matter went to the County Court in Wilkes-Barre . The maintenance of order , the enforcement of the law ( if that were necessary ) , was in the hands of the State Police . State Troop- ers they were called . Their headquarters was the Wyoming Barracksjust across the river from Wilkes-Barre . Originally a mounted service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countrysidein less romantic but more efficient motorcars or on puffing motorcycles . Their routine task was to enforce the speed laws for other vehicles . Dunnigan had noticed one of these black and white cars , with the large block-lettered S P painted on its rear , cruising through the street the first night of the ringing of the bells . He had seen one of its uniformed men in the gathering that had listened to his oration in the parlor of the Wyoming Hotel . His own driver , on that returndash from Nanticoke the noon before , had slowed down when one was seen approaching over the hills . As the driver had mentioned , the forty-mile speed limit was rigidly enforced . Standing outside the rear door of St. Michael 's and just as Father Paul disappeared into the parish house , the press agent again saw one of the Troopers approaching . He was on foot . His car had been left half a block up the street , since it was impossible to drive through the densely-packed inhabitants . HANDSOME AND NEWLY promoted SergeantDennis Patrick O'Rourke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule with equanimity , content , and a lofty and condescendinggood nature . He viewed it mostly from behind the wheel of his speedy coupe , but when he dismounted from this modernchariot , he was conscious that he made a dashing figure in his natty grey uniform with black leather puttees and service hat whose wide brim was smartly turned up and tacked on one side , and had a black strap below the chin . He had health , youth , authority , more than his share of good looks . What else could a young Irish-American desire ? Bad weather had no effect on him . There was a song in his heart when the rain poured so that the car slid dangerously on the asphaltp277of the turnpikes or ploughed through the ' dud of back roads . He did not swear when he had to change a tire in the burning sun . At twenty-two he . lad achieved the goal of his ambitions . He was not , however , an entirely perfect character . He had three pet and petulant hates . He expressed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " millionaires . " The first two dislikes had been forced upon him as a small boy . He had had the misfortune to he the son in the family of the only Catholic-Democrat in a small town of Dutch Reformed-Republican worship . Religious and political tolerance had no place in the code of the youth of that particular Pennsylvania settlement , though their forebearshad come to America to find these qualities . Young Dennis O'Rourke was either bullied or snubbed . His bricklayer father was Irish , Catholic , Democrat . Spawn of the devil himself ! The small lad would have been better treated had he been a Negro or a Chinaman . But a Catholic ! The family moved to cosmopolitan ( and largely Catholic ) Nanticoke when the boy was ten , but the damage had been done . The impressions of childhood are indelible , particularly the injustices . The dislike of " millionaires " came later and was of his own devising . Not entirely perhaps , for his " old man " had spent considerableenergy and time ( in carpet slippers or bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) cursing out the " pluticrats " who had combined to keep a good man clown . And when young Dennis and his sister were through grade school and old enough to go to work , this gentleman had given up the one-sided struggle entirely . O'Rourke senior could now devote his full time  --  about equally divided between the corner saloon and his home  --  to discussing the state of the nation under a tyranny of wealth . Dennis gradually came to realize that a basic aversion to hard work had perhaps a little something to do with his parent 's failure in the economic battle , but the hatred of " millionaires " had also taken root . Not that he knew any , but a succession of employers , representing to his mind the embodiment of intrenched plutocracy , said employers believing firmly in small wages and long hours , had a cumulative effect . At fifteen he resented still pushing a handcart to deliver meats after seven P.m. ( having started the pushing at six-thirty A.M. ) while the boss quit at five and often passed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gasoline-propelled Buick . Under those circumstancesyou might sing " Sweet Rosie O'Grady " at six-thirty with the sunrise , but by sunset its melody somehow stuck in your throat . The young man 's salary was then twelve dollars weekly . At seventeenhe did not see the social justice in sixteen hours a day for a stipend of fifteen dollars weekly as a helper on a delivery truck for the local " department store , " the owner of which was building the new twenty-room mansion that was to be one of the show places of the town . But since his work was outside and gave him a chance to tike deep breaths and view the changing scene , the long hours and small pay could not sour him on the joy of living . Being alive was grand ! He simply acquired , on his own , a hearty hatred for capitalisticemployers . He stuck to this department-store job because he was learning to drive the truck . That gave him a tremendous " kick , " even if he were still working at it long after sundown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of that truck . He was , in fact , soon promoted to be a driver at eighteen dollars . And this money , besideshelping out at home , was putting his sister through a night . school business course . He was fond of that sister . Young O'Rourke did not envy these " millionaire " employers . He did n't want to be one , God knew ! He would n't have sat behind a desk in an office , during the best hours of the day , for all the meat markets and department stores in the state ! He just wanted an active , outdoor life at such remuneration for services that he could live and help his mother , and at the same time not feel he was a wage slave ( as his old man put it ) of some grasping , mansion-buildingemployer . And if , along with this , there could be some authority , some control of power -- At nineteen it suddenly dawned on him what should be his life work . It was right under his nose ! He had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The black and white cars had speeded by his delivery truck which took him to outlying towns as well as purely urban districts -- day after day . In these cars rode Freedom , Security , Authority  --  and a blessed chance to put some of these " millionaires " in their places ! For he had observed ticketsp279being handed out to owners of expensive motors , who in their arroganceoften forgot that they also were subject to laws about the number of miles an hour you should cover , and the crossing of white lines on state roads . He would become ' A State Trooper . He made the acquaintance of some of them and learned the requirements . You had to be twenty-one years old . Well , that age of maturity was only two years off . No hardship to wait two short years to commence a lifetime of bliss . The wages started at sixteen hundred dollars a year . Very satisfactory ! You had to pass certain examinations . He wrote to Harrisburg and obtained the papers setting forth the subject matter of these examinations . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " getting up " ( with his sister 's help ) in these subjects . The day after he was twenty-one he went to Wilkes-Barre and took this examination . He passed , as they say , with flying colors . It was also necessary to have a character recommendation from three persons of standing . And it was here that young Dennis had his first eye-to-eye brush with intrenched capital . " Phis brush solidly confirmed the truth and justice of his prejudice . The priest of his parish church in Nanticoke readily gave him a letter . Dennis Patrick O'Rourke was a clean-living , hard-working boy , who attended Mass every Sunday . The owner of the saloon of which his " old man " was a steady patron ( said owner being a power in local politics ) gave him another . While young Dennis was not personally a source of revenue , an occasional glass of beer being his only alcoholic requirement , this owner knew that O'Rourke senior obtained his more generous liquor budget from the wages of the boy . Dennis applied to the owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a bad morning . The mansion-building merchant had had an argumentative discussion the afternoon before with a member of the State Police over a small matter of parking . Even the belligerence of " did n't the officer know who he was talking to " and the disclosure of his exalted name had no effect . The officer 's exact reply had been : " I do n't care if you are Bucky Walters or Bing Crosby himself ! " Contempt for greatness could not be more conclusively expressed ! So , in that store owner 's wallet burned a small ticket , requiring his presence at a county courthouse a week hence . Since it was hip fifth or sixth offence , the matter might be serious . His daughter also , had received a ticket two days before , because of speeding in her personal Lincoln Zephyr . That ticket likewise rested uneasily on his mind and in his wallet . The innocent request on the part of truck driver number eight . the same being Dennis Patrick O'Rourke , for a recommendation to join the State Troopers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profane tirade against that most estimable branch of the State of Pennsylvania 's law enforcement . Dennis had to procure his certificatefrom his immediate boss , who , with a modest Chevrolet , was not addicted to traffic violations . Naturally , this interview with the department store owner did not add to the young man 's love of the wealthy classes . One more detail . This Nanticoke merchant wore spats . He wore them not ( as did Bill Dunnigan ) for vain adornment , but to keep his ankles warm in cool weather . Dennis noticed these spats. for their wearer in his excitement came out from the sheltered recesses of the executive desk and paced the deep-carpeted floor . Watching those inexorable spats stride back and forth , Dennis had momentarily thought his life dream was going to be trampled to bits into that carpet under their ruthless tread . Their hard-cut lines , their unyielding stiffness , their glaring pearl buttons made a lasting impression . He had never before noticed a man wearing spats . Perhaps all millionaires affected them ! Spats became sure insignia of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He passed his examination , went through a period of training which doubtless included a swift execution in filling in a " speeding ticket " against the side of a car , and was soon admitted to full , lawenforcingfellowship in the service of the state founded by William Penn . And when he presently was placed , first on a motorcycle and then , more recently , as a sergeant in a natty car with a companion , to patrol a specified route each day , no member of the force was more enthusiastically diligent in his duties . He was not entirely heartless to road-law offenders . If the car were humble , if its driver were obviously a working man , he got off with a warning . But let a pleasure-driving , high-powered , custom . bodied motor in the hands of some individual of obvious means , male or female , break even a small fraction of the rules , that male/factor 's doom was sealed ! The ones who tried to " fix " matters by a display of their wealth ( a five or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " attempted bribery added to the violations on their ticket . An occasional wearer of spats who broke the road regulations might even find himself charged with highway robbery and attemptedmurder ! SUCH WAS the background of the particular Pennsylvania State Trooper who was now approaching Bill ( White Spats ) Dunnigan . It should , perhaps , also be mentioned that duringthe past year Sergeant O'Rourke had acquired still another cause of grudge against " capital . " His sister had met and become engaged to a nice Catholic-Polish boy who wanted to start his own business , and was prevented therefrom by lack of any co-operation or understanding on the part of this same ogre  --  Capital . On this particular morning , Sergeant O'Rourke was perhaps not in his usual perfect rapprochement with life in general and his job in particular . He did not sing " Sweet Rosie O'Grady " as hi started out . He had been aroused from his bed at the barracks a full hour earlier than usual . There had been a telephone call from the " Squire " in the settlement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on  --  crowds were gathering  --  a police car had best be sent . Sergeant O'Rourke was selected from the hundred or so men ! hen at the barracks , for Coaltown had been his route that week . I le was familiar with that town 's unusual funeral doings of which the papers had been full  --  he had in fact reported them the night of the starting of the bells . But since they concerned a happening in he churches  --  denomination mostly Catholic  --  and there was apparentlyno law violation and no complaints from citizens of the town , the report had been routine . He had stood ( as Dunnigan had noticed ) with the crowd in the Wyoming Hotel and listened to the speech the press agent then ,  | made for the benefit of the newspapers and the radio . He alone had not been moved by it . The career of Olga Treskovna , Coaltown 's " Breaker Girl , " meant nothing to him . Only when this wealthy city man had spouted about " America being the land of equal chances for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent of a sarcastic smile . Another millionaire shootingoff his mouth . His comment as he left the place had been brief but conclusive . One word  --  Baloney ! But the man was violating no traffic or other regulation if he chose to preach a lot of bunk in the hotel where he was stopping . He felt sorry for the gullibles who believed it . He , Sergeant Dennis Patrick O'Rourke , knew better . He had driven through Coaltown several times the following day . The people were orderly . The line going into St. Michael 's was orderly . There were no complaints regarding the noise of the church bells . Why should there have been by any Coaltown native when it was bringing extra business to every store and saloon , and creating an atmosphere of pleasurable and welcome diversion ? He had checked with the town 's undertaker and the burial papers were in order . Asking about this alien millionaire in charge , he had been told by Mr. Orloff that the man was both very wealthy and very stingy . The usual combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as yet , unhappily , no crime ? But arriving at Coaltown this second morning at six forty-five , and without his usual satisfying breakfast under his wide , revolversupporting , military belt , Sergeant O'Rourke found a different situation . The State 's thoroughfare was completely blocked . A violation of rule 261 that all public highways should be kept open and free at all time for traffic . Even the sight of a police car failed to move the solid mass of people . Still it was happening in front of a Catholic church . The Catholic Church could do no wrong . And the cause of this blocking was said to be a miracle . There was nothing in the rulebook about what to do in the event of a miracle . Leaving the police car in charge of his companion Trooper , he pushed his way through the throng to the church . He would speak to the priest in charge and if everything was O. K. , make some at .. rangement about regulating the people and keeping the roadway . dear.  |p283Instead  of a priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we know ) , he came face to face with William Dunnigan . And it flashed into the Sergeant 's mind that the massed people  --  the blocking of the street  --  was this " millionaire 's " doing ! Perhaps there was no miracle at all . This man had devised something , O'Rourke did not know quite what , to attract further attention to himself . Perhaps he wanted to gather a crowd to make another speech about the " equality of opportunity . " Wealthy and stingy and arrogant , also ! The rules required that you approach citizens politely and give an offender , even the most obnoxious ones , a chance to explain . So Sergeant O'Rourke planted himself in the path of William Dunniganand started the conversation with the mild : " So it 's you again ! What 's going on here ! " " Again ? I do n't quite get you , officer ! " repeated the amazed Mr. Dunnigan . His relationship with the police , the police of dozens of cities , wherever there were theaters or wherever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the tone of the question directed at him by this young Pennsylvania officer implied some previous entanglement with the law in these parts  --  of a magnitude no less than rape or arson ! It had occurred to Dunnigan during the Mass that he should communicate with the proper authorities for handling crowds , so that Father Paul and St. Michael 's  --  Olga Treskovna 's coffin also  --  would have protection . There might be a great influx of strangers . It never crossed his mind that the authorities would do other than co-operate about a matter connected with a funeral service . Especiallyas the crowds drawn by this miraculous happening in St. Michael 's were an entirely unforeseen emergency . " I listened to you spout night before last at the hotel down the street , " answered Sergeant O'Rourke . He stood , feet apart , hands on hips , eyeing at close range this representative of a hateful class . Dunnigan knew nothing of Sergeant O'Rourke 's peculiar dislike for " millionaires . " And even if he had known , he was certainly not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth ! He was a press agent , elated over a gift from Heaven that would sweep across the country ; worried about what his friend Father Paul would decide to do . The verb " spout " gave him the only clue to this unexpected antagonism on the part of the good-looking State Trooper before him . " Spout " was not exactly a term of enthusiastic approbation , especially when projected by sarcastically-curved lips from the cornerof one 's mouth . " I 'm sorry my little speech displeased you , officer , " said Bill in his most friendly manner . He had long ago learned that it was extremely foolish to combat local authorities . When he had been ahead of the circus he had dealt with them constantly . Restraint , tact , an overlooking of any provincial prejudices or quirks was the system . The barking dog could often be won by a friendly word . He continued : " I was just thinking that I must find out where I could secure the help of your well-known , efficient organization . The State Troopers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royal Canadian Mounties " That was as far as he got . Dunnigan 's complimentary remarks about the " service " were not impressing Sergeant O'Rourke . They all talked that way when on the spot . A sure sign of guilt . And in the general looking-over , his eyes had reached the footgear of this soft-soaping , goose-greasing plutocrat . He was not reminded of any Saints in armor . He was reminded of the smug department store owner who had sweated him for two years at eighteen dollars a week and then refused the courtesy of a character certificate . This " counterpart " ( to use Dunnigan 's term ) , whose spats were white and looked brand new , probably worked hundreds of people at starvation wages so that he could ring church bells , and get his name in the papers by orating to spellbound yokels . Rich and stingy , eh ? There would be quite a fine for col  --  lecting a crowd to block the state road . " You 're under arrest ! " interrupted Sergeant O'Rourke without further parley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his belt while the other reached out to grasp the arm of William Dunnigan . Dunnigan 's dilemma was absurd but also loaded with possible tragic consequences . He could resist for he had done nothing to warrant being arrested . He was not exactly to blame if crowds gathered because of a miracle . He knew that he would quickly he freed by any proper authorities if this young and apparently prejudiced officer dragged him to a court . But meantime there would bep285publicity of a kind he must not have . There were a dozen reportersin that crowd , some only a few feet away . And Father Paul ? The arrest of Dunnigan would cause the priest to give immediately his " explanation " of the miracle  --  and perhaps so ruin all the magnificent opportunities that now lay open to advancethe fame of St. Michael 's . It might seriously hurt the " Gardenof the Soul " campaign . It might even stop the ringing of the bells ! " My friend , " said Dunnigan , and he put into his voice all the sincerity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " surely there is some mistake . I have committed no crime that I know of . The body of a member of this parish is awaiting her burial from this church . An unusual , unforeseen and not-to-beexplainedevent has happened . A miracle , no less ! The whole community is amazed and wondering , but as you can see there is no disorder  --  on the contrary the greatest of awed respect , , Dunnigan might as well have talked to a deaf mute . No words of his , no logic or explanation or ingratiating smile could overcome the prejudice created by those brazenly-new white spats . " You have violated rule 261 in blocking a highway for through traffic , and ordinance 341 in unlawfully collecting a crowd , " reiteratedSergeant O'Rourke coldly . " You can make your explanationand your speeches to the judge in Wilkes-Barre . " " Wo n't you please step inside the church , " pleaded Bill . " I am sure we can arrange matters to meet all requirements of the rules . " He thought of the manila envelope in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly a bribe , but a willingness to pay well for services rendered --  " He took out the envelope and unsnapped the rubber band . " I am quite able and willing to pay for any extra service in keepingthe crowds orderly and the roadway clear , " he said , and extracteda hundred-dollar bill from the envelope . It was the most disastrous move he could have made . Sergeant O'Rourke 's face flushed to bursting , then hardened . His jaw lamped like a vise on each word that issued . " So it 's money you think can buy me ! " he exclaimed . Dunnigan realized his mistake . He was in despair . He glanced , shout fearfully . Would he have to call Father Paul after all ! The absurdity of this whole incident ! This young bull wrecking the china shop of countless noble plans ! " Please come inside and talk it over ! " he pleaded again . " I 'll not come inside and I 'll not talk it over ! " said Sergeant O'Rourke . " You 're coming with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handcuffs , so much the worse for you ! And I 'm telephoning the barracks to send a squad to clear out this mob --  " Was heaven indeed now on the side of the press agent ? Was Saint Michael really there behind Bill Dunnigan ? Thinking of it afterwards , that was the only way he could explain it . For at that critical moment two people broke through the crowd , one making for and speaking to William Dunnigan , and the other rushing to Sergeant Dennis O'Rourke . The one who eagerly grasped the press agent 's hand was redheadedand his face was beaming . " Mr. Dunnigan ! " he cried , " I want you to meet  --  that is , my girl wants to meet He turned to present the very pretty young lady who had burst through the throng with him . She was momentarily engaged wit Sergeant O'Rourke and talking to him excitedly . " Dennis , " she was saying , : I 've been trying to get you by piton ever since last night ! We 've got the backing ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Square ! The rich man who is th friend of the actress being buried from here has backed Robert -- - " Kathleen ! " cried Robert Omansky , and seized her arm whirlin her about , " Here is Mr. Dunnigan ! Here is the gentleman tha sent you the rose and has given us the money to start our own lulu room ! " Kathleen O'Rourke whirled from her only brother . She was a impulsive Celtic girl . She had prayed and struggled and say for that Quick Lunch for a year . She had almost given up . Th her Robert rushing in the night before with this tale of an Aladdin Lamp came true ! The actual money in his hand ! Since that hot she had been in the clouds ! After the rush to the Square and tit negotiations there , she had hardly slept all night . She had bee at the Nanticoke garage a full hour before the time . She no looked on the Arabian Night jinni who had made their di-ea come true ! She was very much in love with Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Rourke saw his only sister suddenly throw her arms about the neck of the culprit he was about to arrest ; kiss him ; release him just as suddenly and burst into a flood of happy tears . " Denny , " cried Robert Omansky , " this is my swell partner that 's backed Kathleen and me ! " Then , remembering formalities , he said with a labored attempt at correct usage , " Mr. Dunnigan , sir , please meet my future brother-in-law to be , Sergeant Dennis O'Rourke of the State Police ! " As neither of the men made a move he added , " But maybe you 've met already ! " There are moments in life when Destiny , Fate , what you will , can benumb the strongest of mortals . Both Sergeant O'Rourke and William Dunnigan were stunned . Sergeant O'Rourke was the first to recover . A member of the State Police must be equal to any emergency . But even Sergeant O'Rourke had to swallow hard before he spoke . " I  --  I have just met Mr. Dunnigan , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was holding the hand of Robert Omansky . They were both gazing at Bill ( White Spats ) Dunnigan as if he were an angel from the morning skies . Sergeant O'Rourke held out his hand . There were no handcuffs in it . He thought of that , for , being Irish , he did have a sense of humor . He smiled , the Irish smile that lit his face when he sang " Sweet Rosie O'Grady . " " I 'm glad to know you , to meet you again , Mr. Dunnigan , " he said . " I guess  --  I guess I made a slight mistake . Just tell me what you want done , sir . A miracle , is it ? 0 . K. I guess my buddy and I  --  I left him back in the car  --  can regulate miracles . I handled the mob at the funeral of an ex-mayor in Wilkes-Barre last month so this is just in my department ! If these people want to get into this church , we 'll line ' em up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block the state road . And someone inside to keep them moving . I 'll phone for half a dozen more men . You 'll maybe be needing them to see you through the funeral of your friend . " Dunnigan had taken out the green silk handkerchief and mopped his brow . He had taken the hand of Sergeant O'Rourke . They both took deep breaths . Then they laughed . " No hard feelings ? " said Sergeant O'Rourke . " No hard feelings , Sergeant , " said Bill Dunnigan . " You werep288only doing your duty . But I want to tell you sometime about that speech you did n't like . I do n't like it now much myself . A lot of things have happened around here since that speech was made two nights ago . " So did the majesty of the law come over to the side of St. Michael 's . And presently , under the able supervision of Sergeant O'Rourke , was started the blocks-long line , at first of Coaltown people but soon augmented by the entire countryside  --  by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abreast , moving slowly up to and through St. Michael 's doors . A. line that was as much an item of news as the miracle itself . Father Paul 's little church and this line were soon to flash as a part of the newsreels in every picture theater in the land . WHEN FATHER PAUL had told Bill Dunni gan he was going to the parish house to pray for guidance , he dit not mean that he would fall upon his knees in some secret room and so remain until he felt that he had been handed a solution of the problem . He did indeed ask for divine help , but he felt that wl had been given an intellect by Almighty God and that we wety expected to exercise that intellect . And he had discovered thhe could best function as a thinking man when his hands we occupied with some humble and useful work  --  a task that he could automatically accomplish while struggling with the greater questio at hand . By some psychological twist this occupation of his hands seemed to leave his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , wondered if Jesus , when on ear had not kept His youthful tools of carpentry , and when there ha been moments of doubt and ferr ( as there had been even for Him if He had not labored over the fitting of a shelf , the cutting of hoard , while reaching an all-wise determination . When there ha been mention in sacred lore of relics of the Master  --  the pieces the True Cross , a thorn from the True Crown  --  he had wondered why no one had thought to treasure a simple adze , a rule fafp289measuring , some one of the implements of the trade practiced at the side of Joseph by that Son who was Divine . Would not one of these have been a thing very close to His heart  --  a thing of intimateconnection with judgments that were to live forever ? Father Paul was one of those men with absolutely no mechanical ability . The driving of a nail usually resulted in a bandaged thumb . He sometimes thought St. Michael 's would have been much better served had its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painter . It had needed badly the ministrations of all these , not to mention those of a stone mason about the sinking foundations . And there had been no money to hire them from the laity . He had managed to paint the crosses above the door and at the top of the roof apex  --  the latter at the risk of life and limb on a tall , borrowed ladder held by his elderly sexton . But even this small paint job had ruined one of his two black suits . White paint improved the crosses but not the appearance of a jet black suit . He had learned a little about gardening , and ( as Dunnigan had noted the first day ) , kept his lawn well trimmed ; planted flowers in a circular bed between the parish house and the church . He grew enough vegetables in the small patch at the back to supply his simple needs in summer , though Japanese beetles and like insects had no particular respect for the clergy . They attacked clerical as well as secular gardens . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bending over his lettuce and tomato vines or pushing the ancient lawnmower with one blade broken . But in the autumn , when he wished to occupy his hands , he had to turn to another task diversion . He turned to one used by many another single , lonely man . He darned socks . They always needed darning ! The lining of his shoes was invariablyworn through , and sharp edges of leather rubbing against soft cotton or lisle created a destructive friction . Tramping the hill streets of Coaltown gave that friction plenty of scope and exercise . The heels of some of Father Paul 's socks held more darning than they did of the original material . Working at this domestic task brought an additional comfort to Father Paul . It brought back his mother . It was the dress-making mother who had taught the lad this highly useful exercise for the hands . She taught him before he went away to St. Joseph 's Seminary . She gave him the white , shorthandleddarning egg which was placed inside the toe or heel of the worn item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needle . Next to a rosary , also a gift of his mother , this darning egg was Father Paul 's greatest personal treasure . He had become reasonably skillful in weaving the thread back and forth over the gaping spaces and giving the cross work , now and then , a sharp pat to make it set . He had never acquired the art of quickly threading the needle . Fifteen years of practice and determination had not improved his speed , his technique , his accuracy . It was a skill of accomplishment that heaven had denied him utterly . Threading the needle took longer sometimes than the actual work ! But , as we know , the priest was a persevering soul , and he never entirely gave up . The thread always , sooner or later , was projected through the elusive hole in that small steel instrument . Father Paul felt if he ever gave up in this bedeviling prelude to darning he would falter in greater tasks . The needle was threaded quickly this morning of the miracle . Was that a good omen ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inserting the wooden egg he attacked these holes vigorously while his mind debated the distressing problem of what had occurredto his altar statues . He was not interrupted in the parish house for he had stationed a choir boy at the door , placing a dollar in the youth 's hand , with orders that no one was to be admitted during his meditation . But ponder as he would , darn as he would , he could not reach a conclusion . The statues had turned because the pillars sup . porting them had turned and slightly tipped . There were the cracks in the basement floor . The pillars had turned because the earth at their base had moved . This could be explained by the mine shafts . But could it be fully explained ? What power had caused mine shafts two thousand feet below to make this disturbance at this particular time of all the years they had been there , and in such a manner as to cause both statues to face the coffin of Olga Treskovna ? Had Dunnigan been right in reiterating it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old psalmist came to the priest :  |p291For  the Lord is a great God , and a great King above all gods . In his hand are the deep places of the earth : the strength of the hills is his also . The sea is his , and he made it : and his hands formed the dry land. 0 come , let us worship and bow down : let us kneel before the Lord our maker . For he is our God : and we are the people of his pasture , and the sheep of his hand . Today , if ye will hear his voice . In His hand are the deep places of the earth . So it was set down in Holy Writ . Over and over again the pros and cons of the event tore at the intellect of Father Paul . And there was the very human problem of the effect all this had had , was now having , and would continue to have on the people of the town . When he pondered that , his heart was torn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To cast , at the very least , the dark shadow of doubt across the bright glowing of that faith , doubt that the hand of God had been there ! What would be gained thereby ? And what never-to-be-regained faith would be lost ! Father Paul darned every hole in three pairs of badly damaged socks . It took him twenty minutes to thread the needles on the second pair . But the hardest thinking and the neatest darning of is whole life brought him only more confusion , carried hint no tearer to a determination of his duty as a priest . He put down the needle , the socks , the darning egg . There was last resort . He must consult his Bishop ; go to the near-by cathedralcity  --  immediately  --  as soon as possible  --  for an older and more perienced wisdom . The whole matter would , in the end , have be placed in this official 's hands . More than a full hour had passed . It was another half hour bile he changed to his best black suit , his one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat , and heated himself some breakfast porridge so that he could make the bus journey , his body tified . But before he could go , before these and other tasks were conunmated , his Bishop carne to him.  |p292FATHER  PAUL 'S Bishop was a genial Iris gentleman who believed both life and religion should be a cu of joy and happiness . Of better than medium height , wide an sturdy of face and body , he kept that body in robust health  --  an his mind also  --  by fine surroundings , good food , good wine , go cigars . He lived nobly in the three-storied mansion adjoining and a Cached to his cathedral and built of the same excellent grey san stone . He was a collector of good paintings and valuable editions of both books and brandies . The rugs , the draperies , the furniture of this mansion were the finest , and many of the pieces of furniture were of considerab value . His ( lining table , for example , and its chairs and the m sive buffet cabinet at one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chandelier overhead . The china service h been especially made by the famous Royal Worcestershire potter in England . His silver was solid sterling . His linen was fr Dublin . The house was staffed by a number of capable servant and he had the best chef in the city . Think not the less of him for this , for these surroundings ga that broad body and broad mind a tremendous energy . T Bishop abounded in good works done in the same grand mann in which he lived . Over that dining table and its perfect cuisi were formulated many plans for the betterment of his city . A the necessary money was raised alongside the rare brandy and t. expensive cigars to carry these plans through . He labored wi a tireless zeal on every civic committee that would help the to He spoke well and with a blessed humor at every gathering of public importance . He maintained with his own purse a " Center " the poorest quarter , with a day nursery , a playground , a gymnasia He induced manufacturers to open new businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cadillac car was as ofp293before the door of a ward hospital or a tenement building as it was on the driveway of some wealthy man 's estate . He probably had more friends in every walk and condition and belief of life than any other citizen of his cathedral community . Catholic , Protestant , Jew , no faith at all  --  this Bishop was known and loved by all . Tolerance , that virtue of virtues , might be said to have been his middle name  --  tolerance and a belief that happinessand the good things of life were not the tools of Satan ; that a long face and indifference to luxury did not necessarily denote sanctity . Though born in Ireland , he was a staunch American patriot , who was devoted to his adopted country with a sincere and ardent belief in its democracy and in all that we mean by the American way of life . Freedom was blazoned on his banner along with the triple crown of his personal faith . He was a true liberal . He knew about the ringing of the Coaltown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the story in black headlines in both his local newspapers . He was not disturbed by it . His bishopric was dotted with a number of settlements of almost entirely foreign origin , where the sermons were in an alien tongue , and where many and often picturesque customs of the motherlands had been transplantedand nurtured . Coaltown was such a settlement , and if they had chosen to ring their bells for a month it was a matter for the local clergy and the local civil authorities to decide . He liked the sound of bells , anyway , and could ( and often did ) as an amateur , play the chimes of his own cathedral . His only thought about the Coaltown episode was that he hoped it would bring some joy into a drab neighborhood . He knew the sullen grind of the lives of the workers in the mines . The Bishop was an early riser and had breakfast promptly at seven every morning . While eating he listened to the news broadcastfrom his console radio . After the enthusiastic announcement indicating that the salvation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simpson Ackerly maker-to-wearer clothes and a few other items of national concern , the entire ten minutes that morning was given to an event said to have occurred in the Roman Catholic Church of St. Michael the Archangel in Coaltown . A reporter on the scene described the crowds that had gathered and the " miracle " that had allegedly taken place in this parish church where the bells had already been ringing for two days in connection with the funeral service of an actress with a Polish name who was born there . Was n't that the small church to which he had sent a Polish boy several years before whose mother had been so eager for her son to have a parish ? One of the lads who had started in his own cathedral ? The Bishop made a note that he must someday soon visit Coaltown . As for this radio talk of a miracle , it was probably a reporter 's exaggeration of some simple happening on a morning when news was scarce . These Poles were an excitable people . The incident would be over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day ahead  --  a meeting with the Mayor at nine , another meeting at ten with both Rabbi Solemann of the large synagogue and the Protestant Bishop of St. John 's about the United Charities campaign , a luncheon of the Rotary Club at which he was the guest of honor . And his secretary had just placed before him a long list of afternoon appointments at the rectory . " Remind me to drive to Coaltown the first free morning we have next week , " he told his secretary . He proceeded to finish his breakfast , his mind on the business of the day . Coaltown was not content to wait until another week . It waited scarcely ten minutes before it again projected itself on the conscienceand consciousness of the Bishop . His telephone started to ring . It did not ring with calls from unimportant Coaltown . They were at first from the editors of the newspapers of his own city and the city of Wilkes-Barre . Then long-distance calls from the city desks of the early afternoon editions of papers in Philadelphia , Pittsburgh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also and the Press Associations . All wanting an official statement from the Church regarding this first seemingly-authentic miracle to occur in America . The Bishop was by this time repeating to himself , " Well , well ! Well , well ! " with a not unpleasurable accent . His secretary found that St. Michael 's had no telephone . The only priest in Coaltown with a telephone was Father Spinsky at St. Leo 's , and Father Spinsky the Bishop did not like . If this newspaper and radio barrage against planned tasks werep295to continue  --  and it was continuing  --  he decided he had best postponethe tasks and seek some facts at first hand . Besides , his own keen interest was now aroused . He instructed the secretary to rearrange the schedule of appointments  --  put off the Mayor and the Rabbi and the other Bishop till afternoon if possible , cancel the afternoon engagements at the rectory . If he started at once he would be back in time for the Rotary luncheon , at which the Mayor would be present . By eight o'clock he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles distant . He arrived just as Father Paul was emerging from his parish house to take a bus to the cathedral city . The Bishop 's car had had a deal of company on the drive . The sually little-frequented road to the hill country was spotted with any other cars . The whole countryside was wide awake and on is way to see a new wonder while it was fresh in the happening . Even as a growing cavalcade was speeding toward Coaltown , their ar radios were telling more details . Two great marble statues weighing tons had miraculously turned toward the coffin of the screen star Olga Treskovna . This girl of poverty for whom the ells were ringing might be another Theresa of Sainthood . Some announcer had remembered that the canonized Carmelite nun had ritten a book called " The Castle of the Soul . " Olga Treskovna 's hn was named " The Garden of the Soul . " It was about a girl ho became a nun . The Bishop was acquiring a very healthy riosity about it all as he approached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street of this dingy , mininguntryLourdes . This curiosity was not lessened by the triple line of several thousand people , men , women and children , extending several hocks to the door of St. Michael 's . Or by the great throng thats still gathered around that church , although the roadway was ing kept clear and free . It was only clear because a dozen State l uppers were on hand , regulating traffic , directing cars to side frets for parking , herding the people into the long lines , all rider the direction of a particularly energetic young Sergeant . otorcycle Troopers had whizzed by the Bishop 's car earlier indrive . Sergeant Dennis O'Rourke had telephoned for hisreserves and was on the job in earnest.  |p296The  Bishop 's car drew up in front of the small parish house just as Father Paul was emerging from its doorway . The still-waiti and ever-increasing throng , the reporters ( some now with cameras the State Troopers , the Bishop 's great car ( for Father Paul immediately recognized it ) were almost more than the little priest cote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terror , an almost physical terror . The door of the car opened . A State Trooper whom Sergea O'Rourke had placed in front of Father Paul 's parsonage , open the car door and stood smartly at one side in salute . Every Wy wing Valley Trooper knew that car well . It was the Bishop w gave so generously each year to their Recreation Fund , w never failed to attend their track meet and their ball gam Father Paul saw his Bishop step out  --  dignifiedly resplendent in handsome black cassock with purple buttons and the purple tassel on his black biretta , saw him shake hands with the happily emb rassed Trooper and pass a friendly word . And now the greatwas mounting the uneven wooden steps up the short embankm and coming toward the humble pastor of St. Michael 's . The Bishop  --  a smile on his not unhandsome face  --  started speak as soon as he spied the startled parish priest . " Well , well , my lad ! You seem to have started something your town ! Do n't look so worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see all these people flocking to a chi . ' I wish the likes of it would happen at my own cathedral . I h you 're taking up collections . " Father Paul gulped . " You 're kind , indeed , to speak of it way , Your Excellency , " he gasped . " I am terribly distressed was just on my way to come to you . A rather dreadful thin that is , it seemed dreadful at first and now I do n't know  --  a drea thing has happened , and I badly need your counsel . " " Well , here I am after a fine morning ride across your hills , we 'll go inside the parish house and hear all about it , " said Bishop , taking Father Paul 's hand in a firm and friendly gr " But cheer up ! The radio reports have me all atingle . It sou most interesting ! " and he paused on the steps to again view crowd from this higher vantage point . But before these two could find the privacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave of newsmen swept around them . They had been waiting to get at Father Paul . Now they had also the Bishop of the district in their net , for he had , of course , been recognized . Even while he had been speaking to Father Paul a murmur was going through the crowd : " The Bishop ! " " Bishop O'Conner ! " " He has come clear from Scranton ! " " What will the Bishop say ! " The reporters were not backward . " May we have a shot for the afternoon papers , Your Reverence , " cried two cameramen at once , and one of them was already holding his instrument high up before him and adjusting a proper focus . " Of course , boys , " said the Bishop , " only wait ! I want Father Paul of St. Michael 's in it . He was one of my boys , and this is his party , not mine . Where are you , Paul ? Do n't back away ! And smile , my lad , smile ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael 's . " It 's time the press realized what handsome clergy are right in their midst ! " exclaimed the Bishop with the greatest of good humor . This excitement on a bright , sunny morning was a tonic he was enjoying to the full . He placed an arm about the little priest as the camera shutters clicked and clicked again . The other newsmen were ready with their notebooks . " A statement ! A statement ! " came from several in one voice . " Ah  --  for that , boys , you 'll have to wait , " the Bishop said . " You know more about it than I do . I 'm just arrived , as you see . Off the record , I hope it 's all true . We need a good , old-fashioned miracle these days to wake us up . And do n't the bells sound grand ! I 'll see you all after I talk with Father Paul . It 's his miracle , not mine , you know . " So Father Paul and his Bishop were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to see the statues first ? " asked Father Paul . " They have really turned . We can go there through the sanctuary door . " " I want your story first , " said the Bishop . " I might not believe hat I see . I can believe what you tell me . And I hope you do n't rind if I smoke . I like to have my after-breakfast smoke sitting quietly . The newspapers sent me scurrying from my rectory this morning before I had barely finished eating ! You did n't at all consider my comfort in timing your miracle ! "  |p298He  produced from beneath his cassock two cigars of formidable size and color . One of these he handed to Father Paul . " I  --  I do n't think I 'd best try one now , " said Father Paul . " My stomach is already a hit on edge . " " You should smoke a pipe , " said the Bishop . " Tobacco is one of the real blessings bestowed upon mankind . It has kept many a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send you a pipe that was given me last week by a great philosopher who masquerades at running a corner tobacco store near my church . And a can of Bond Street which will not burn your tongue . " He had by this time lit his cigar and inhaled several puffs of its satisfying fragrance . " Now , my boy , let 's hear about it all , " he said . Father Paul took a deep breath . What a wonderful man his Bishop was ! He poured out his troubled heart as to a confessor . " It started as I was sitting just here Monday evening , very low in spirit , looking over my unpaid bills , which were like my life , Father  --  hopes and desires unsatisfied , bankrupt  --  and there was prolonged jangle of my doorbell . A stranger I had never see before stood in my doorway and demanded if I were Father Paul A stranger I have learned to love and yet I wondered today if h had been sent by God or Satan ! " And he related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since William Dunnigan , press agent out-of-a-job , ha arrived in Coaltown with the body of the unwanted , unkno Olga Treskovna . The Bishop listened carefully . He did not remove his eyes fro the face of Father Paul during the long narrative . Like all really important men , he gave his full attention if he talked with one all . Only he wished Father . Paul 's chairs were a little more co fortable ! He made a mental note to see that St. Michael 's paris house office was supplied with a large leather one that was in 11 storeroom . " I 'm not sure that your press agent gentleman is n't entire right , " he said at last , after puffing in silence for a full thr minutes at the end of Father Paul 's strange story . " Dunnigan y say his name is ? Good . An Irishman . Sentimental and ha headed at the same time . You Poles ca n't combine the two . Mu be one or the other . "  | " But what shall we say about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So-called ? " replied the Bishop . " I have told you there is an explanation , " said Father Paul . The Bishop smiled . " I have no doubt our modern weather bureaus could have explained when Jesus rebuked the winds and the sea for His disciples and there was a great calm . The calm ' had been moving toward that area ' for sometime . I have no doubt modern medical science could explain many of the cures . Perhaps even the five loaves and the two fishes were near an explainable cache He knew of in the desert , placed there by the Roman Office of Price Administration ! The name of the play this Irish gentlemanmentioned  --  what did you say it was again ? " he switched the subject abruptly . " Why , I think he called it False Gods , ' " said Father Paul . " That was the name ! " said the Bishop . " I remember it well . It was written by Eugene Brieux , a great writer . I do n't wonder your friend could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are no linguists . I 'm not sure of it myself ! But I saw the play in London when I was a young man studying there . Wonderful music it had too , composed by Camille Saint-Satins . And a fine English star it was who portrayed the High Priest  --  Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree . He had a strain of Irish blood . The scene you mention ' made a strong impression on me , also . I wonder why the movie people have n't made a film of such a play . I must speak of tt to Max Goldstein who manages the picture theater nearest my church . The man might get a promotion if he suggested it . " " You think then that we should keep silent regarding any ex-lanations ? " " Paul , we live a good deal by our illusions . I sometimes think hat much of our happiness is based on them . Is your chronic eptic happy ? No . But your man who believes  --  not foolishly , f course  --  but who has faith that all is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is your ardent worker , your contented citizen . And your good Christian , too . The greatest shock of my life was hen , as a lad , a smart older boy told me there was no Saint Nicholas who came down the chimneys and filled the stockings at Christmas . He had his damnable explanations of the miracle of a child 's Christmas . I never forgave that boy . And he was not right in the larger sense . Saint Nicholas is in the heart of every generous soul at Christmas time . As I grew older I discovered other things that I wished I had not discovered . . . When did you say is to be the funeral service for this girl ? " " It is planned for Friday , " said Father Paul . " At least we will make no comment until after that service , " said the Bishop . " And even then we need not confirm or deny . " " But the rules of our Hierarchy , , The Bishop for once interrupted . He arose and made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I pray God no complicated issue is made of it , " he said , " with meetings of clergy , high dignitaries , conference and commissions to listen to the learned opinions of Dr. This and the Most Holy Reverend That ! Learned indeed ! What blunders have sometimes been made of such things . The Maid of Orleans  --  Blessed ' Joan the valor of Lorraine '  --  Lorraine was her province  --  wrote sinner Francois Villon five hundred years before we canonized her ! We burnt her , but the heart of the people knew even then . That voicof the people , Villon in his gutter , knew more surely than all ou Hierarchies , our concordants , our Congregations of Rites , our Lor Bishops , our professors of theology  --  learned ignorance judging th handiwork of God ! And what a mistake we made concerning tha miracle at Lourdes . God spare us from all that ! What I can an will say publicly is this : Who really knows ? Two forces . God i His supreme wisdom . And the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I believe that as I believe in Holy Writ . The Bishop moved to the single window and looked out at t crowded lawn . He visioned beyond that lawn the packed stre and the great line down that street . " Your people are strongly stirred , " he continued . " I think m of them needed that stirring . Maybe you needed it , Paul , my la Maybe I needed it . Many of those out there will realize agai perhaps for the first time in months , in years , the beauty of t Mass , that greatest miracle of all . Do we have to explain th miracle ? The wine into Christ 's Blood ? The wafer into Body ? Those people of yours and mine will again feel the comfo and glory and happiness of communing with our Saints . T results of this occurrence can only bring good . Must we church men prate of explanations ? "  |p301The  Bishop sat again on his folding chair . The smoke of his cigar came in great puffs . Then the smile quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must point out one other matter . The Bishop 's smile helped him to mention it . " I can not forget that it was all started partly to promote a motion picture , " he said . " I believe Mr. Dunnigan sincere ; I respect his honesty , but can the Church lend itself " Again the Bishop held up his hand . " It is curious that a stage play should help point out the right path for us ; and that another play should be at the beginnings of your miracle . And yet it is not so curious , Paul . The real Theater is like the Church  --  or should be  --  a source of guidance and wisdom and inspiration . I believe in the Theater . It started in our Church . The first Englishand French plays were sacred stories . They were even named miracle plays . Just as the first great paintings were all inspired by characters of the Testaments . I have dreamed often of a Theater more closely united to the Church . Working with the Church for good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage my clergy to go . There are bad plays  --  yes . But then there have been bad priests in high places in our Church . Bad pontiffs even . ' That did not destroy the Church . I believe our America is morally sound and healthy and that most of the plays that last are good . ' The bad ones die of themselves , just as all evil dies . " " But this is a motion picture . " " A ' new art , but with tremendous influence  --  and so , tremendous possibilities for good . How they have improved in the last two years . I attend them regularly now . You should attend them . You will learn something new each time about your fellowmen  --  and you and I can not learn too much of the human comedy  --  and tragedy  --  if we are to rightly help those who need us . " It was Father Paul who now rose suddenly from his chair . A change had been taking place inside him as he listened to his Bishop . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked traight at the lithograph of Saint Michael on his wall . The fightingSaint he , Paul , was supposed to represent as vicar of a church that bore that fighting name . A Saint who had even touched that stranger to the church , William Dunnigan . And the spirit of Saint Michael seemed , for the first time , to reach out to him ex- tending the strength and courage and the will to face any danger . The will to fight and conquer for one 's ideals ! He faced his Bishop , a new flame burning in his soul and in his homely but ardent face . The Bishop even was a little startled at what he saw there . " You must know , " said Father Paul , " I have always been afraid . There have been days of courage , but I have always returned to fear . I was afraid when my bells started ringing . I was afraid as I said my Mass this morning . I was afraid when I opened my door awhile ago and saw the crowds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its door opened and you were coming up my steps . " But now , thanks to you , thanks to this strange man Dunnigan , thanks to Saint Michael and with God 's help , I do n't think I will ever be afraid again ! " " There you are ! " said the Bishop . " Is not that a miracle ? An . when I 've made a good pipesmoker of you  --  perhaps even a cig. smoker later on " The Bishop also rose and held out his hand . " I have two r. quests to make . We Bishops always want something ! First , invite me to attend your funeral service Friday . " " I would be honored if you yourself would officiate , " gasp Father Paul . " No . I will not do that . That is your duty . Your priviledge. - This is your church . I will preside in your sanctuary . I 'll tell yo  --  I have some new requiem mass vestments  --  very lovely  --  black an silver and purple . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this theater man think that we can not keep up our end  --  the spectacle . " " How am I to thank you ? " asked Father Paul . " That is simple . Remain brave . Remain strong . Banish th fear forever . Never return to it . Smile . We  --  you and I  --  a custodians of the greatest well of happiness ever given to nankin . See that your people understand this  --  see that they do not thirsty simply because they do not know . " They were by then at the open door . The crowd was es . larger than before . A newsreel camera straddling the top of a c started to grind as the Bishop again took the hand of Father Pa " I almost forgot my other request , " the Bishop said , " Tell yo theater friend his film must be shown in my city at least one wp303before it appears in New York . The Archbishop there always chides me that the films I try to tell him about have long since been seen by him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Archbishop ! Good-by . " The Bishop purposely did not go inside the church . That he would do on Friday at the funeral . He had heard Father Paul and that was enough . To look seemed to him would mean that he had a doubt . To the waiting newsmen he said : " I believe there is here a great stirring of the power of God . A miracle we may call it . I say this personally , not as an official of the Church . I can only speak now from my heart . Ask me nothing more at this time . All , I do like the ringing of these bells ! They may be ringing for the dead , but life is here , gentlemen , and they are a joyful sound . Why do we in America always associate church bells with somber thoughts ? Bells are happy ! They mean happiness . " The Bishop looked up at the bell tower of St. Michael 's . There were slatted windows around its top and through them you could see the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful and had the quality of a voice . The eyes of the newsmenlooked upward also . " Is not that sound a miracle ! " said the Bishop . " Our churches are filled with these lovely singing voices and they are too seldom heard . My own cathedral is a sorry example . A few brief moments on the Sabbath is their allotted time . We might have less preachingand more singing of those bells . I think I am going to propose that our bells be rung for several hours on Easter and Christmas  --  even on days of lesser moment in the church calendar . And certainlyon our national holidays . The Fourth of July . The birthdayof the great Lincoln . The very swinging of the bells means Liberty . Their voices cry Freedom ! These villages do better than our cities  --  they still sound the evening Angelus . The daily call to prayer . The Christian prayer . I am going to sound the Angelus in my city from now on . I am going to ring my cathedral chimes on holidays for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businessmen 's luncheon I am now to attend . Think it over , boys . Maybe if you write about it , other cities will try it tool " And the Bishop made the sign of the cross to the people , entered his car and was driven away.  |p304THE  BISHOP " in their notebooks , " the reporters moved on to the priest of St. Michael the Archangel . They found a new Father Paul , no longer terrified and abashed . Not for himselfbut for Saint Michael he spoke up boldly and with purpose . " The statues have turned , " he said , " and they were not touched by human hands . That I can vouch fdr . Is it a miracle ? I leave that for my people to decide . For myself , I know that Saint Michael , the patron of this church , is a potent Angel . He could , I believe , accomplish whatever he chose to do . " " Just who was he ? " asked a young reporter . Could there be a story even in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting Angels , " said Father Paul , and into his own eyes came a glint of battle . " He goes back even before the advent of our Blessed Lord upon this earth . He was the Prince of the Host guarding the temple of God . He drove the proud Lucifer from Heaven . It was written of his army , ' These are the Watchmen set upon the walls of Jerusalem , to stand in the power of the Lord round about His people . ' He was a fighter like  - -  like Jack Dempsey or General MacArthur ! A friend of mine has named him ' Saint Michael the Scrapper ' ! The ' undefeated Cham-pion ' ! " The newsmen took a sudden interest . What they thought was going to be just a preachment had a punch line . This little , funny-looking priest was a live wire ! " You mean they had a battle up in Heaven , " said the young reporter . " The battle of battles ! " said Father Paul . " Surely you men know about that . Saint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he was n't afraid of a personal scrap . " He was going to say " encounter . " He changed the noun just in time . And was it his voice that was speaking up so fearlessly to reporters for newspapers ?  |p305He  continued with just the trace of a smile in his glowing eyes . " Saint Michael , himself , took on Kid Lucifer and put him down and out for the full count ! He was tops , my friends ! And he is still tops ! " Bill Dunnigan , himself , could not have said it better . Father Paul 's Saint was emerging from a dim past into someone for a headline . The priest continued . " My statue of him here  --  one of the statues that has turned  --  is a very grand one ! " Again he was going to say " beautiful " but he changed the adjective . Maybe he should have said " swell " and so made it even stronger . " I will take you and show you . You photographers may take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another quite like it in America . " " But this Saint Michael did his fighting a pretty long time ago , " said the skeptical , very young reporter . " Ah , there you are mistaken ! " said Father Paul . And how good it was not to be afraid ! " Saint Michael fights today ! Do you not know he is the patron saint of aviation ? I thought you did not . He rides in every fighter plane that takes the sky for liberty and freedom from evil . He rides in every battleship that plows the seas for justice , for he is also the patron saint of mariners ! " This was something new to all of them . They wrote it down . The most calloused , most irreligious felt the fervor of this country priest . And his humanity . They followed him through the chanceldoor and presently flash-bulbs for the first time crackled in a church in Coaltown . Next day the tabloids carried something besides the likenesses of murderers and divorcees . Readers partial to sporting subjects were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Champion , " a marble gentleman in armor , his sword upraised , his foot upon the head of a rival who was undoubtedly " out for the full ount . " And next week the rotogravures had pictures of an altar of God as well as shots at race tracks and the latest fashions in slacks . Thus did Saint Michael the Archangel  --  Saint Michael the Scrapper  --  breakinto the news , along with a film called " The Garden of the Soul , " along with Father Paul , unknown parish priest , and Olga Treskovna , rapidly becoming-known motion-picture star . But alone at last in his study , the little priest felt a trifle faint .   " I wonder  --  I wonder if I am doing rightly ? " he said to his desk . But this wavering was only for a moment and for the last time . How was it his Bishop had spoken ? " Banish this fear forever ! " Father Paul had drunk the blood of courage . Ten minutes later one of his vestrymen , who came to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dollar bills and fivedollarbills ( for the druggist and the garage owner , unable to pass among the people in the packed church , had taken up stations with their long-handled baskets at the door )  --  this vestryman. was startled beyond measure to find his pastor puffing energetically , though a trifle pale of countenance , on a large and very brown cigar . The Bishop had left the one offered Father Paul lying on the little priest 's desk . " Why , Father , I did n't know you used tobacco ! " the man exclaimed . " I usually smoke a pipe , " said Father Paul calmly , " but I have just had a talk with our Bishop and I think I will change to cigars . I hope you took up a collection at the Mass . " " And how ! " replied the garage keeper . It was he who brought the money . And he dumped out a veritable mountain of currenc on the desk of St. Michael 's parish office , where candle bills tw  --  nights before could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael ' during the time of the Bishop 's call . He had watched Father Pa cross the short space of his lawn , speak briefly to the several new men there , disappear into the parish house . The priest wishedbe alone and Dunnigan had respected that wish . Then came the adventure with Sergeant Dennis O'Rourke an the appearance of Robert Omansky and his girl . What a fortuna " break " that had been ! The cold sweat broke out on his forehead as he thought of it . His quick-lunch partner had unknowing ) repaid , with interest , that investment .   " A fine host I am ! " he said to the boy and girl , " I invite you to early Mass and then am nowhere to be found . But honestly , I had no idea so many other people would decide to attend . It sort of swamped me and tied me up . I do n't suppose you were able to get inside the church . " " My Robert got me in , " said the girl proudly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the press agent , remembering his own struggle to reach the side door of St. Michael 's . " I saw there was no chance by the main door , " said the boy , " but there was a small door into the bell tower . We went up a flight and there was another door --  " " And we were in the choir loft ! " broke in the girl . " We saw the Mass from there  --  and the holy statues that have turned and the coffin of Miss Treskovna . My Robert always gets what he goes after . " " I think you and your man are going to make a success of life , " laughed Dunnigan . " I 've noticed the O'Rourke side of the family also has a certain degree of determination . But I lose both of you your jobs if I do n't rush you back to Nanticoke pronto ! " He looked at his watch . Robert Omansky 's hour of seven was irrevocablyin the limbo of the past . " I 've lost my job already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around last night to give the boss a week 's notice  --  he 's on himself at night  --  and he fired me . Said he always knew I was a fool and now he was sure of it . " But this low evaluation of his intellect had not seemed to depress the new owner of a quick-lunch on the main Square . " Now I 'm sure you 'll be a success ! " And Dunnigan laughed again . " Great men are always fired at least once before their triumphs . Thomas Edison , Ulysses S. Grant , Benjamin Franklin  --  and there is another guy I could mention ! But I was counting on your cooking me another Special for my breakfast . I 'm hungry now and that 's a fact . " Miracles had not lessened the Dunnigan appetite . The three of them returned to the Wyoming Hotel . Dunnigan 's Packard was waiting there . The press agent paused only long enough to pick up a box from his room . Father Paul was going to be cheated of his share of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discussed by three famished souls  --  four in fact , for the driver was given a share  --  on the first few miles of the trip to Nanticoke . And added to the repertory of Quick Lunch Heaven by a unanimous vote of all stockholders . St. Leo 's Chocolate Cake ! Bill Dunnigan had things to do in Nanticoke and he also felt it best to absent himself from the immediate scene . With funeral expert Dennis O'Rourke and his Troopers in charge of crowds , he felt all would move smoothly around St. Michael 's . Father Paul must be given a chance to fight out his problem of the miracle . Somehow Dunnigan felt that struggle would also cone out all right . And more than ever he did not wish to personally appear in any way to be involved with these latest events , as indeed he was not . Let Coaltown speak and let what had happened speak . Here was a situation where the presence of a known press agent  --  and there might be newsmen arriving from the larger cities who knew him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells were seething . The crowds , which had so frightened Father Paul , were like heady wine to his spirits . The man who had helped crowd a quarter of a million people into Boyle 's Thirty Acres , who had packed the Polo Grounds and Soldiers ' Field on more than one occasion , who had done his part to make big musicals gross forty thousand weekly , season after season , felt in his rightful element . Even there , on that hill road , a steady stream of cars was moving by in the direction of Coaltown and St. Michael 's . He must not in any way muff this magnificent opportunity . As he rode along he tried to bring some order to his mind . He had three labors ahead . Three obligations . They were interwoven yet distinct . First , the task for which he came to Coaltown . The simple burial of Olga Treskovna . Simple ? When her name would that night be in every newspaper in the land , when already- it was doubtless being mentioned by every radio newscaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funeral the climax of this wave of publicity that had rolled up with such amazing swiftness since he had stood with Father Paul at the cemetery and conceived the idea of ringing the Coaltown bells . Well , he would keep its spirit simple . There should be the little girls " with wings " beside thep309coffin , there should be the blind organist , there should be Father Paul at his simple altar in the little church . The crowds , both the curious and the adoring , should not change that . " We 're reaching for that star of yours , kid , " he said to himself and to her , " and to get to a star you must ride a comet ! You ca n't ride comets without the world looking up to see what 's happening . But it will all help Father Paul and St. Michael 's . They stood by us when there was n't any glory , any money , any hope . Now we can repay that debt . " For Father Paul and St. Michael 's was the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracle had given it a tremendous lift . St. Michael 's would not lack attendance for the Mass the following morning or the next . But what about when " the tumult and the shouting died " ? Maybe even  --  the way things were going  --  when the Captains and the Kings departed ? Dunnigan knew that the time to strike for a lasting success was while the iron was red hot . In the theater , when the newspapers gave fine reviews , when there were lines at the box office , then ( he always felt ) was a time to increase , not lessen the efforts of promotion . One reason he was journeying to Nanticoke was to have his window cards printed , the cards with which he intended to " bill the town . " The cards were to read : DO N'T FORGETA Mass at St. Michael's(Coaltown)at 5:45 A.M.EVERY MORNING . FATHER PAUL'SMINERS ' MASSAT ST . MICHAEL'SHe had elaborated somewhat on his previous cope . He would print the five forty-five in numerals . Easier to read . He wouId put " Coaltown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . cards could be placed in outlying districts . He would start calling it " Father Paul 's Miners ' Mass . " The prestige of the miracle would greatly help in placing these ends . No store , no saloon would now turn down this service . And the Miners ' Union . He must get after them while things were booming . He must make the acquaintance of the head of that Union . They must be persuaded to support Father Paul as a body . Dunnigan could now , thanks to Coaltown 's leap into print , give this local Union also a boost that would not be without value and acclaim . He had neglected the concert of Polish songs he 'd thought of for that afternoon . But only for the moment . The miracle providedenough attendance for that day . Perhaps a concert the next afternoon  --  the day before the funeral . And have it a memorial to the father . They were his songs . That would please Olga Treskovna , he knew . Olga Trocki who had gone to gather the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , Bill knew . He would speak of such a concert to Father Paul when he got back to Coaltown . There was an idea simmering also that there could be a concer of old Polish melodies every week . He believed he could make tie-up with the local radio station about it . Broadcast it to a the near-by cities . Great Polish music in memory of Stanislau Trocki ! Give Pop a break also ! That would make her happy And it would help to keep the name of St. Michael 's shining lik a beacon . Shining over the magic of the air waves . For each con cert should start and end with the sound of Father Paul 's bell the bell of St. Michael 's ! Another thought : Some team of t several great song writers he counted among his friends woul compose a ballad and title it , " The Bell of St. Michael 's ! " Bi would persuade them to assign all royalties to Father Paul a dedicate it  --  on every song cover  --  to Father Paul of the Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third task  --  " The Garden of the Soul . " Only his best was going to be good enough for what Marc Harris had done ! He was now drawing five hundred dollars week . More than twenty-five thousand dollars a year . He , I3 Dunnigan ! It was twice the salary he had ever been paid up the time he met the picture producer . He recalled his start as a " publicity " man . He had been hit by a lower East Side dance hall . He was seventeen years old b looked older . His title was " Assistant Floor Manager , " but was really the bouncer . He had a reputation in the neighborhood for being handy with his fists  --  had then thought seriously oc becom-P311ing a professional fighter . But the memory of his mother had caused him to forego that profession . His mother did not approve of prize fighters . His dance hall task had been to tap the shoulders of gentlemen patrons who insisted on wearing their hats onto the dance floor , who ignored the polite sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WHILE DANCINGBy Order of the Management . Or of requesting other gentlemen not to " expectorate " on the wax . Decorative spittoons were thoughtfully and conveniently provided along the wall by this same " management . " But sometimes there were profane objections to this interference with customary ballroommanners . His abilities as a boxer often stood him in good stead when these principles of Emily Post were being violated . This dance hall was waltzing and turkey trotting ( so to speak ) on its last financial legs . The " management " was about to throw in the sponge and the towel . Perhaps there was too heavy insistence on strict etiquette . Young Assistant Floor Manager Dunniganwanted to keep that job . It paid twenty-five dollars weekly . The rage of the dance world was then the great team of Vernon and Irene Castle , who had set the town to talking with their exhibitionsin the ballroom of the old Waldorf-Astoria  --  with their appearances at the new Palace Theater way uptown in a place newly named Times Square . The tall Irish boy put on his best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra careful polish , and made a call at the Waldorf . He must have looked not unlike the quick-lunch lad who now sat beside him in the Packard . He accomplished the unbelievable . He got to the Castles in their apartment . He persuaded these great ones to come to this East Side dance hall for an exhibition the following Saturday night ! He had sold newspapers . People read them , he noticed . He journeyed around and told the newspapers about his " booking . " He had laboriously written out longhand copies headed " Important Vews Item " telling in glowing terms of this coming " supreme event . " He left , these " news items " with the City Desks where they thought i1 a joke until several telephoned the Castles and found that it was true ! They printed ( somewhat edited as to adjectives ) that first Dunnigan press notice . The next week he interviewed a fabulous lady named Ruth St. Denis who was appearing as Salome at Proctor 's Theater at TwentyThirdStreet . She also succumbed to the enthusiasm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She promised to come to the dance hall for half an hour with her act the coming Saturday . She kept that promise . It required police reserves to handle the crowds around the bankrupt dance hall . The die was cast . William Dunnigan had discovered that he could not only make friends but influence people  --  and newspapers ! He turned down a raise to a thirty-dollar weekly stipend . He moved on to greater tasks in larger fields . At forty dollars weekly he became the advance agent for a burlesque troupe . He was i show business . Well , he was still in show business along with miracles and St Michael 's . Just how , at five hundred bucks a week , was he going . to best apply miracles and a church to the aggrandizement o Super Pictures , Inc. , and " The Garden of the Soul " ? To accopush that was also his duty now . The story of the new film , thank God , was clean and even i spiring . It had a religious theme at its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's because of a linking of the two . happened that Marcus Harris had always stood for " clean " pi . tures . As we know , he was a religious man in his own faith . H private life was upright . Without trumpeting about it , he h. quite naturally kept away from the salacious and the harmf sensational . When Dunnigan , on inspiration , had started the Coaltown bel ringing for four days , he had not thought of where to go on fro - that . It had , for the inspired moment , seemed all that was necsary . But after the first excitement of the bells  --  the first ne stories about it  --  he realized that something more must happe News in America , at least news of national importance , was never for twenty-four hours only . Other happenings in a newsy wor quickly drove a single event from the press and from the min. of the readers of that press . In that first boyhood effort lie h instinctively climaxed the polite Castles with the sensational Sp313lome dancer . Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his climaxes deliberately . What next in Coaltown ? The unexpected miracle had provided the second lift . Olga Treskovna ( and that name was now inseparable from " The Garden of the Soul " ) was the central figure of a supernatural event . It would , he was certain , simply as news carry on and climax the ringing of the bells . It had the further advantage that it would cause talk  --  argument . That argument would last beyond that night when it would be read of at every dinner and supper table in America  --  or at least be there to be read . And at every breakfasttable the following morning . All of which must create a desire to see the new film . It also had a pictorial appeal to newsmen that the bells could not by themselves stimulate . He had seen the sudden influx of cameramen and several newsreel cars . Pictures sometimes spoke louder than words . Trust these sleuths of the cameras to make the most of a picturesque village church , two statues that had " turned , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know that a Bishop had already been added to the gallery ) , and the crowds of a mining town . He hoped that Father Paul would not hide from the news-spreading lenses . He hoped the priest ( if the church rules did not forbid ) would permit the cameramen inside ' St. Michael 's . So  --  the next move ? It was going to be mighty hard to top a miracle . He was like a playwright with a great second act , too great almost , for the third was bound to be an anticlimax . Heaven was not likely to drop another miraculous plum into his lap ! Saint Michael ( as he firmly believed ) had carried the ball for a grand touchdown . A sensational touchdown . It was clearly up to Bill Dunnigan to provide the next flare for the papers , and so keep " The Garden of the Soul " in the public eye . The funeral itself was now the third act of this Coaltown drama . How could he keep it simple and sedate and yet have something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need of consulting Marcus Harris . That was another reason he was journeying again to Nanticoke . He wondered how New York had received the miracle . The New York papers might even ignore it entirely . But that scarcely seemed a likelihood.  | There were telephones in Coaltown but none that he could use were private . The Wyoming Hotel 's equipment consisted of a pay station on the lobby wall , not even surrounded by a booth . Ile did not feel that the booth in the drug store offered much better protection . The ever-present wife of that merchant had ears trained to pierce its thin partitions . Any plans laid from there would be public property in five minutes , possibly only four ! As he rode along all this passed through his mind much more quickly than it has been recorded . His companions , noticing his fixed gaze ahead , sat quietly . They were still somewhat in awe of the great man who had befriended them . He was the miracle of Coaltown in their eyes . They had breakfast at a restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quick Lunch Heaven . They had paid two hundred and fifty dollars down on the new place on the Square . Seven hundred and fifty more in small monthly payments would completely own it , or a further cash payment of five hundred dollars . Bill took out his checkbook and wrote a check for the latter amount . He made it payable to the girl . " This is a wedding present to you , " he said . " You 're putting id into the business , not me . It is n't even from me  --  it 's from m boss back in New York . He 'll be glad to do it when he knows . " In his checkbook record Dunnigan made a notation . The in corruptible Pennsylvania State Police would have been surpris . to read it -- could the meaning have been deciphered . It said : " On account securing services and good will S. T. $500 . " " S. T. " stood for State Troopers . Where , indeed , would he au Marcus Harris have been but for Kathleen O'Rourke ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the week The boy went to complete his deal . Bill Dunnigan went to find florist , for he wanted a blanket of roses made up for Olga Trekovna 's coffin . AIso to find a job printer who could set up in type his St. Michael 's Mass show cards at once . And by that timO Marcus Harris would be in his office and he could talk with hies by telephone . There was a general office of the phone company in Nanticoke . It would have impersonal , soundproof booths . The picture producer should certainly be pleased with the mot ing 's happenings .   MARCUS J. HARRIS would have forged to the top in whatever business he had undertaken . He had energy , resourcefulness , determination , but the spark plug of his success was a by-product of still another quality  --  concentration . He believed in what he did . The task to which he set his hand ( the rest of his compact body , also , and his mind ) was the most important task in the entire world . This had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pants and the making of a million-dollar film . While he was in the former industry , empires might rise and fall , a presidential campaign or a World Series come and go ; they were not nearly as important as the delivery of a pair of trousers when promised , and the conscientious creasing of these trousers before delivery . Every picture he had made , whether a silent melodramatic serial or a great all-star spectacle with symphonic orchestra , was undertakenin the same thorough manner . Whatever work he was responsible for must be the best of its kind , because the world existed at that moment solely for the purpose of receiving that pair of trousers or that film . So , had he remained in " cleaning and pressing , " this same world , or some part of it , would doubtless have been ( with the prompt delivery of and the perfect creasing of many of its trousers ) a less irritating and more sartorial-beauteous planet . And there would have been a lot of trousers so groomed in many cities thereon ! His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop into a nation-wide chain of such shops , all giving this superlative and soul-gratifying service . In fact , he changed over to motion pictures because he had journeyed to Fourteenth Street one morning with the idea of establishing his first basement branch in that business section  --  if he could find a vacant basement . He desired a " business address " with the prestige of that center of metropolitan retail commerce , not only for his own aspirations , but because the father of the girl he wanted to marry seemed to look down on a businessman whose headquarters were on East Seventieth Street . This father owned a prosperous jewelry store on upper Broadway . Very well , young Marcus Harris would go the father one better . He would enable himself to send out monthly bills from the great Fourteenth Street . But arriving there by the Third Avenue Elevated , he quickly found there were more than enough basement tailor shops on that busy street . Several in every block ! And walking along past the plate-glass-fronted stores , the young man felt a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew that rents of above-ground locations were much too high for the twenty-five cents a pair that sponging and pressing then brought . Suppose he and his brother went into some entirely new business ? A business with big enough returns to warrant the renting of a store ! They had saved a thousand dollars between them from three years of intensive industry and frugal living spent in pants pressing . Their father on his deathbed had left them another thousand . Two thousand dollars in all . He was toying with this revolutionary thought when he paused in front of a vacant shop . The door stood open and an estate agent was showing it to a prospective renter . Marcus Harris stepped inside to see how far beyond anything he could probably pay its rental would be . It was entirely outside the means of a pants pressing establishment . Three hundred dollars a month ! He and his brother paid thirty dollars on East Seventieth Street . But it did not seem to be beyond the means of the vocation of the other space-searcher , a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noon hour and the two left together . They exchanged a few friendly words . They went into the next door Hartford Lunch for a sandwich and a cup of coffee . They commenced talking . The stranger was from Brooklyn and he , also , was looking to establish himself in this heart of Manhattan . They found that they bore the same first names . It seemed to draw them together . They formed an immediate liking for each other . The Brooklyn boy , to whom three hundred dollars monthly wasP317not an impossibility , was in an entirely different " line . " Amusements . He operated two penny arcades in Brooklyn  --  those recreationcenters for the proletariat where , for a copper in a slot and the turning of a small crank , you could see two boxers or a dancer or an acrobat appear to be in motion . It was accomplished by means of a series of photographs on tiny cards that flipped into view in such rapid succession as to give an illusion of consecutive movement . For the musically inclined , tube-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass ( if a penny were deposited ) ; and two black tubes inserted in the ears of the investor brought the thumping melody of the Sextette from " Lucia " or the sentimental " Down Where the Wurzburger Flows . " This young impresario for the masses wanted to bring the cultural benefits of such sterling entertainment to New York City proper . He believed that on a great money-spending thoroughfare like FourteenthStreet the price of these various delights could be raised to five cents . He had a name to call his place of entertainment . A Nickelodeon ! Looking beyond even this , the stranger had an entirely new and startling conception . The large vaudeville theaters were showing , as a minor part of their programs of acts , short " moving pictures " thrown on a screen from a rapidly moving film projected from a sort of magic lantern . They were beginning to record stories  --  little plays as it were on these films . To be sure , the pictures had to stopand words were in turn projected on this screen when dialogue was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! This stranger believed that people would pay a small fee  --  say ten cents , perhaps even fifteen  --  to see a whole program , lasting an hour or so , made up entirely of such " moving pictures . " He believed that a regular theater could be used ! The performance could be continuous so that the house could be filled eight or ten times a day , not just for a matinee and an evening . Patrons could come at any convenient hour and , if they missed the beginning of a story , they need only wait until it came around again in the film routine . There would not be much operating expense as the entertainment was mechanical . No stagehands , no actors . Just ticket sellers and ushers , and a couple of piano players to supply a background of " Hearts and Flowers " or " William Tell " accompaniment . But to start this daring enterprise he needed more capital than heP118possessed . He needed five thousand dollars . He had three , which he had made from his penny arcades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was one that later graced the marquees of seemingly countless " picture palaces " across America  --  this land of immediate reward for foresight and courage . Marcus Harris listened . Here would be getting up out of basementswith a vengeance ! A Nickelodeon ! A real theater ! And a new business without the profit-crushing competition of pants pressing ! The other Marcus could consider paying three hundred dollarsmonthly for the store space , because he took in as much as fifty dollars daily in each of his Brooklyn penny arcades . You 'd have to press two hundred pairs of pants a day to do that . Marcus Harris and his brother were lucky if they pressed two hundred pairs in two weeks . The two young men named Marcus agreed to meet next morning at the Hartford Lunch . There was heated argument that night in the East Seventieth Street basement . The girl , whose name was Rachel and who had been asked to come over , was all for it . She knew nothing about penny arcades , but often went with her parents to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture part of the show . It was the part she liked best . The older Harris brother was against it . To him it sounded completely crazy . They might as well throw their money into the near-by East River . Younger brother Marcus Harris was debating , but he knew he had made up his mind . Pants pressing had already lost this bright jewel from its crown . The younger brother and his fiancee won out . The savings and the inheritance were to be risked in the new venture with this young man from Brooklyn , if the girl approved of him . Marcus Harris wanted her confirmation . As a compromise ( and an anchorage ) the older brother was to continue the cleaning and pressing place until there were tangible results from Fourteenth Street . A man would be hired as his helper . Marcus Harris would give all his time to the new enterprise . This is not a saga of the motion-picture industry . Enough that the . girl Rachel thought the other Marcus sincere , honest , dependable . By noon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be opened as quickly as possible in that vacantP319store on Fourteenth Street on the south side of Union Square . And the search for a vacant theater and the larger plan commenced . The Nickelodeon paid from the start . On that busy Square a hundred dollars flowed in the first opening day . The first Saturday brought nearly two hundred dollars . The two active partners felt they could pay themselves a hundred dollars weekly salary . It was more than Marcus Harris sometimes made during an entire month with the hardest kind of work on East Seventieth Street . He and his Rachel were married . Beyond the salaries , a sizable surplus was piling up each week . The young man with the startling conception located an empty theater . It was right on Broadway but north of Twenty-Third Street . But then he felt the amusement center was moving " uptown . " It might even jump as far as Herald Square ! The partners leased this theater for six months with further options . They had to pay two months rent in advance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its dingy interior , cleaning and repairing the seats , putting up new signs outside . They installeda staff and the necessary apparatus for projecting a program of " motion pictures . " They put advertisements in newspapers , such newspapers as would accept them , for the more conservative journalsdid not care to sell space announcing such a dubious form of entertainment . In one way and another the partners were risking their entire capital . The first day , less , much less , came in than clown at the Nickelodeon , The gross receipts were twelve dollars and twenty cents . Hardly more than enough to pay the ushers . Brother Irving , who had now given up the tailor shop entirely and was selling tickets behind the grated window , was in a near panic . But Marcus Harris and the other Marcus were steadfast . The audiences  --  the daring ones who parted with ten cents and ventured inside  --  liked the idea . These two young proprietors took furns tearing tickets at the door . They talked with the customers as they came out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days to see the next episode in " The Perils of Pauline . " They would not miss the next Torn Mix adventure , They wanted to see if King Baggott won the girl . The theater was changing its program twice weekly . P320The second day receipts went up . Eighteen dollars and forty cents was garnered . And there were no complaints . The third day the " take " doubled . Twenty-nine dollars ! Brother Irving was still pessimistic  --  it was just a fluke  --  it would not last  --  but the two boys whose names were Marcus felt " they had something . " They took a loss , however , for several weeks . The Fourteenth Street Nickelodeon paid that loss . Two of the partners went to the Hartford Lunch each midnight and over ten cents ' worth of coffee and doughnuts made plans about hiring " sandwich men "  - -  putting out a " banner "  --  distributing printed handbills in the neighborhood . Brother Irving spent his ten cents to journey up to East SeventiethStreet and gaze sadly at a darkened basement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack them in "  --  to sell out from the middle of the afternoon till late at night . In two months there was a regular profit of over two thousand dollars weekly ! Thus humbly commenced a great empire of motion-picture show houses . Had Marcus Harris remained a part of it , he would have become a multi-millionaire . But accumulating wealth was not his goal . His personal tastes were modest . So were his Rachel 's . They had only themselves , for Heaven did not grant them children . Although audiences were soon filling two other theaters added to the chain by the energetic lad from Brooklyn , and competitors were springing up who also did exceedingly well , the instinct that partnerMarcus Harris possessed for doing a single thing finely , kept gnawing at his content . He was not happy about the films they could secure . He felt that these moving pictures could be much better made  --  have better actors  --  better stories . And why must they be only one or two reels in length ? Just as you got interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take up two hours as a play did in a regular theater ? And why not make a " serial " from a really wellwrittenstory  --  the serial stories that were published in the good magazines his Rachel bought and read ? He purchased the right to make into a film a great Broadway successthat had before that been a great novel . He paid the fabulous price of ten thousand dollars for this right . Even then the owners did not wish to sell , feeling it would cheapen  --  maybe ruin  --  their property . He persuaded a well-known playwright to make a pictureadaptation on condition that the matter be kept secret . He in-P321duced one brother of a famous theater family to appear in the leadingrole . He had met a sympathetic director of serials who also wanted to try producing on film an entire play . Marcus Harris took over the staff and equipment of a large studio in New Jersey just across from 125th Street . All this ran into a lot of money . Much more than he had . He sold back his interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plunged this small fortune into the making of a great , spectacular movie . The brother , now simply looking out for finance , went along with Marcus Harris . It was , fortunately , a success . It got back in rentals the quarter of a million dollars it eventually cost . It stayed in one New York theater for three months ! A film ! It went on to make another quarter of a million profit . Marcus Harris had proven his idea correct . You could do a full length play on film . Audiences would sit through it . And see effects no theater could duplicate . A battle scene with a thousand horsemen ! The whole street of a town in action ! At the other extreme , the most minute detail of the expression of the eyes or the lips . With this taste of creating great picture plays in his mouth , a man like Marcus Harris could never go back to simply operating theaters , no matter what the profits might be . He became a producer . As a producer he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chances . The pictures could not all be successful . In producing there was not the steady crescendo of sure profits that adding new theaters in the right locations to his chain now gave the young Brooklyn Marcus who had started with a penny arcade . For the popularity of this new form of entertainment grew by unbelievable leaps and bounds . It challenged and surpassed the patronage of the regular playhouses . Most of the films were still only a couple of reels in length and cheap in story and handling ; but Marcus Harris could not bring himself to make pictures , short or long , in that manner . Nor did he care to produce " wholesale , " so that by the law of averages he would always win . He tried that for awhile , just after the introduction of sound and its spoken dialogue , but he soon resigned from a great corporation of which lie was a partner . The same instinctthat caused him to want each pair of pants that left the East Seventieth Street basement to be perfect , and which pants he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriedover into the making of a film . He wanted to make only as many pictures as he could personally plan for and personally supervise . So while not the largest producer , he soon became known as one of the finest and most careful . When a Harris film failed , it was not because it was not well done . The subject matter simply did not have a wide enough popular appeal . He was always tempted to try new subjects . He made the first picture with a religious theme . He made several without the usual happy ending . He made one entirely about the life of a traitor to his country that had the best acting of its year . This pioneering sometimes cost him almost all he had made . But his integrity was of the highest , and he could go to Wall Street if he needed more money for the next one . Sooner or later he would turn out another box-office winner . This expert knowledge of a new art , gained in the hard but thoroughschool of trial and error , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The casual observer thought him simply lucky , or that his success was due entirely to the clever people he managed to draw to his Studios . They did not realize that even these clever ones were guided by the brain of the onetime pants presser , the brain that wanted everything to be " the best , " that consideredeach film he undertook the most important task in the world ! He was content , even when he occasionally lost all his profits on several unsuccessful stories . He and his Rachel did not covet yachts and country houses and racing stables . Many of the stars he used ( and often made ) who went in for such things , ended each year with much more money than Marcus Harris . The producer had a sizable apartment on West End Avenue . He had a small farm in Westchester County where his wife 's father and mother now lived . He and Rachel would sometime retire there , when he became too old to work and take chances . ' They wanted nothing more . His home life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up for by a very great love of each other . Rachel 's friends were in New York  --  her social life , her charities , her small clubs were there . So he did not move to California when the producing part of theP323great new business migrated to the West Coast . He preferred the inconvenience of commuting back and forth . At first it was a hardship , but nowadays with fast planes , it was not too tiring . They may not have realized it , but this constant separation had strengthenedtheir affection . They had no chance to get tired of each other , or if not tired , to take each other for granted . They missed each other damnably in the separations , but it kept their love always young . One last observation . With Marcus Harris , work was a thing for working hours . Outside of those hours he was not the pants presser or the picture producer . He was a husband who had found the perfect companion . To make her happy and proud of him  --  that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his own life any traits of his trade . As a presser of pants he never bothered to crease his own trousers . He liked them roomy and baggy ! As a producer he did not go in for any of the glamorous life of his films . He did not even care much for attending the theater . He preferred to sit at home by the living room table and read his newspaper , then play pinochle or cribbage with his wife or with her friends who might drop in . Their flat on West End Avenue was simple and comfortable . It was only the office  --  the place where her Marcus met his business world  --  that Rachel wanted him to be in a magnificent setting . She was very proud of him . She thought he was the greatest pictureproducer in the world . But she would have been just as proud had he been the world 's best pants presser . She knew he was the world 's best husband . She knew he could not be anything but the greatest in whatever work he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine-thirty o'clock the morning of the miracle . Friends had dropped in the evening before and they had played gin rummy till a late hour . So the producer did not hear the radio news broadcast at eight-thirty to which he usually listened . He liked that broadcast , not so much for the news , but because its announcer , after the official weather report , always gave the " unofficial McCarthyreaction " in a pithy , humorous phrase . Marcus Harris wore his overshoes or left off his topcoat according to the advice of that phrase . It was seldom wrong . So he missed the " unofficial reaction " that morning ; he also missed the mention that a " miracle " was reported to have occurred in connection with his star , Olga Treskovna , and the bell-ringing church in Pennsylvania . There was nothing , of course , about it in his morning paper which had been printed before the turning of the statues was discovered . He had not gone directly to his office . There was a meeting of the board of the Hebrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a vice-president and active force . The Society 's building was " downtown " and he went directly there , takingthe subway at 1o3rd Street . In New York he still preferred this democratic means of transportation . On leaving his apartment house his thoughts as usual turned to his business . Those thoughts were similar to the thoughts of WilliamDunnigan , except that they were concerned entirely with " The Garden of the Soul . " The news stories of the ringing of the bells had aroused the dramaticeditors . Largely on request by telephone and wire ( an unusualmanifestation of interest ) , the drama departments were being supplied with such " still " photographs as were in New York of scenes from the new picture , as well as photographs of Olga Treskovnain the leading role . More " stills " were being rushed from Hollywood by airmail . Stories about the film and its new star were being mimeographed and dispatched to the lists every producer 's office kept of all the papers of importance in the entire country . The Press would have full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too well that these releases would only be used if the news end of the promotion were kept alive . For , what with cutting , editing , inserting subtitles , synchronizing of a musical score , it would be a full month before the picture could possibly be playing in theaters . What could his press agent think of meantime to keep up the news interest ? It was nearly noon by the time he reached his Radio City office . P325Excitement there was running almost as high as on the day before . This time Miss Feinberg was waiting at her employer 's desk . She had heard about the " miracle " over the radio . When ten o'clock came and he had not arrived , she broke a rule and telephoned the Harris apartment . Both Mr. and Mrs. Harris were out , for Rachel Harris had gone , as she always did , to personally do her marketing . Miss Feinberg could only wait impatiently . She did not wait idly for again there were telephone calls from the newspaper offices and the broadcasting newsrooms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak directly to Mr. Harris . At eleven o'clock the publicity department had advance copies of the afternoon papers . They were passed from hand to hand among the office staff and now awaited , on his desk , the arrival of the president . These papers gave the answer to any letting-down of news interest on the part of Mr. Dunnigan . The alleged event in Coaltown , the excitement it had created , was recorded on the first page of most of them . Usually in a two- or three-column box which set it off even better than if the story were printed up and down a single column . PM had a photograph of St. Michael 's church and the crowds outsideit . Another paper carried one of the Bishop of the district and the parish priest of this church standing together . These photographshad been radio-wired to New York by a photo-press service . A MIRACLE REPORTED IN PENNSYLVANIA TOWN WHERE BELLS ARE RINGING FOR LATE FILM STARwas a typical headline . One paper even said " the late Olga Treskovna " as if her name were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed a graphic reciting of the discovery of the turning of the statues of Saint Michael and the Madonna in the direction of the coffin of this girl . In two papers the entire story of the bells was repeated , and one tabloid had a photograph of Miss Treskovna covering its outside page . " Mr. Dunnigan is certainly on the job ! " exclaimed Miss Feinberg proudly as she greeted the smiling Marcus Harris and spread out the news sheets before him . " No one but the one and only White Spats ' could put on a stunt like it tells about today . It 's magnificent ! It 's sensational ! "   Since the hiring of Bill Dunnigan , Miss Feinberg was rapidly acquiring a vocabulary of superlatives . Marcus Harris seized the papers , but the smile slowly vanished from his face as he read . He read them all , unsmiling and in silence . Having read , he did not burst into the expected approbation of his ace press agent 's newest achievement . There was instead a decided look of worry on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all carry articles about Miss Treskovna and the film , " the secretary added , as her employer , for some unexplainedreason , seemed to be most unhappy ! " The World-Telegramhas nearly half a page about her early hardships in this miningtown , and how you gave her a chance in Hollywood  --  they must have sent a special writer to the town . But all this front page stuff , Mr. Harris ! I do n't think any film ever made got such an advance build-up . " Marcus Harris remained silent . He did not seem to Miss Feinberg to be listening . He was regarding again the front-page headlines , and he took up the paper which had Father Paul and his Bishop looking out from its left center . Miss Feinberg could see his jaw hardening and his thick lips forming in a tense line . A danger signal . " What is wrong , Mr. Harris ? " she could not refrain from crying . She felt she would risk her job to defend Mr. Dunnigan , if there was now some new reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like it , " said Marcus Harris . " I do n't like it at all ! See if you can reach Dunnigan by telephone . " " He 's been trying to reach you , " gasped the mystified secretary . " Has phoned twice and will call again at noon . But what 's th . trouble , Mr. Harris ? That picture of a Bishop and a priest is won derful for us ! And a church ! Of course , it 's not like as if it wer a synagogue but ' The Garden of the Soul ' is a Catholic story . I know two grand priests up in the Bronx . They 're not unlucky . You could n't buy such front-page attention like Mr. Dunnigan has grabbed off for us today for a million dollars ! Even the Times has telephoned you and I 'm sure that in the morning --  " Marcus Harris looked up at his secretary . " I 'm wondering just what it dad cost ! " he said . " But Mr. Harris ! If I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Mr. Dunnigan to spare no expense . You sent him twice as much as he asked for . You had the bank wire to give him unlimitedcredit . " Let anyone ever again speak to Miss Feinberg of the inconsistency of women . Women indeed ! Men ! " I know what I said and what I did , " snapped Marcus Harris grimly . " Stop talking and try to contact Dunnigan at once . What was that hotel ? Wyoming . In Coaltown , Pennsylvania . Get him on the phone immediately ! " " Yes , Mr. Harris , " she said . But there was the glint of battle  --  almost revolt  --  in her eyes and voice . Miss Feinberg did not have to " try , to contact " Bill Dunnigan . As we know , he was not at that moment in Coaltown . The telephonefrom the office switchboard was buzzing . Pennsylvania was on the wire again and wanting Mr. Harris personally . " It 's Mr. Dunnigan now ! " said Miss Feinberg , so fiercely that the picture producer gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Over the wire came a happy , confident voice . Still aggressively standing by the desk , Miss Feinberg could also hear it . " Hello , Marcus boss ! This is Bill Dunnigan ! It 's great news we have this morning for The Garden of the Soul . ' " " What great news ? " asked Marcus Harris . To the press agent , encased in a telephone booth in Nanticoke , there was a surprising lack of enthusiasm in the producer 's voice . It did n't sound at all like the voice of the employer who had telegraphedtwenty grand instead of ten . Or the friend who had signed the second wire " Marcus . " Could it be New York did not yet know ? Even so , without news of the miracle , the bells were still ringing . That exploit seemed to rate a better comeback on their first direct conversation than an antagonistic , disapproving " What great news ? " " Perhaps the evening papers are n't out yet , " said Bill Dunnigan , " or maybe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think if you 'll send out for the papers , you 'll find that maybe , perhaps , your new star is given mention again . I 'm in Nanticoke now , but our little Coaltown was bubbling over with big-time reporters when I left there . " " The evening papers are out and I have read them , " said Marcus Harris . " You 've made the first page again all right , all right . "  | " Anything wrong about that ! " exclaimed the voice from Nanticoke . What did his boss expect and want ? If this coldness was his idea of being funny , Dunnigan did n't relish its humor . There was just a little too much at stake . " You 'll be glad to know there 's a picture of your church , and one showing a bishop and a priest , " continued Marcus Harris . And it sounded to Dunnigan as if this commendable " flash " was to he construedas a great calamity ! " I do n't know about any bishops , " said the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garden of the Soul ' a boost no film I know of has ever had . Miracles do n't happen in churches everyday . What 's eating you , Marcus ? I do n't get you at all . " " What did it cost to pull it off ? " said Marcus Harris . " What did it cost ! Good lord , are you joking ? " exclaimed Dunnigan . Was the Maecenas who disclaimed being a piker now worrying about money ? Human nature was unpredictable indeed . " I 'm far from joking . What did you pay to have it done ? " came the stern voice from New York . William Dunnigan nearly dropped his receiver . He was used to unusual reactions in a career devoted to instigating that same , but this was too much . " You mean you think I had it done ! " he finally exclaimed . " What else am I to think ? " came the voice of Marcus Harris . " Look here , Dunnigan . Your ringing of the church bells was a great idea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I suspect , you cooked it up yourself . That do n't hurt anyone . But this latest stunt ! I 'm a religious man . I go to my synagogue . I 'm respected there . I do n't give a damn about the money . I told you to shoot the works . But I did n't expect you to use that money to tamper with another religion  --  to hire someone to move holy statues in a church ! I do n't want to play that game . I do n't play that game ! " For the love of Mike ! " came an interruption from the Pennsylvaniaend . " Let me finish , " continued Marcus Harris with deadly sternness . " It 's tampering with something we have no right to tamper with . And it will surely bring us bad luck . It will bring Super Pictures , Inc. , a retribution ! It 's dishonest ! It 's sacrilege ! It will --  ! " P329But the astonished Bill Dunnigan was now fully articulate . He broke in and there was undisguised scorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Listen and use your bean that I did n't think was such a dumb one . Do you think that your Moses  --  or was it Elijah ?  --  paid someone to push back the lied Sea ? Do you read that your Daniel paid to get out of the lions ' den ? Did Jonah buy his way out of that whale ? For God 's sake , do you believe that money turned that Bible dame into salt  --  that a bank roll could The picture producer interrupted this hectic enumeration of Old Testament supernatural occurrences . Fortunately perhaps , for WilliamDunnigan 's limited knowledge was running out of examples . " Are you telling me there really was a miracle in this Catholic church ! " he broke in . " That it was n't a job you thought up , and hired to be done ? " Dunnigan took a deep breath of the carbon dioxide of his phone booth . " That 's what I 'm telling you ! " he said . And what sounded like a most profane ejaculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't happen now ! " exclaimed a defensive Mar- ( us Harris in a voice containing both relief and amazement . " It happened up here without any help from your massive bank account or my massive brain ! Get that straight , Marcus . 1 ma ) not be as damn religious as you say you arc ! I do n't go to any church or mosque or synagogue  --  no one knows or respects me there ' I 'm better known in barrooms and gin mills , but I play the game , I hope . And there 's a priest , not to mention a Saint , at this particularCatholic church  --  you tell me you 've got the pictures there  --  he 's a little guy with a little church  --  that I would n't doublecross for all the motion pictures your cheap Hollywood fakers have made or ever will make ! " Bill Dunnigan sounded pretty sore . He was sore . He was about to slam down his receiver . " Wait ! Do n't hang up , Bill ! " cried Mr. Harris . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensed the acrimonious mood of his press agent . And the great man looked up a little helplessly at his secretary . William Dunnigan must not go on the warpath at such a moment ! Miss Feinberg was equal to the occasion . She had saved situationsbefore . She pointed to the tops of her shoes .   " Spats ! " she tensely whispered . " Spats ! " Marcus Harris did not know exactly what she meant , but he made a guess and a correct one . " Bill , did the new white spats arrive O. K. ? " he spoke quickly into his telephone . The man in the booth at Nanticoke stayed his hand toward the receiver hook . He had to smile . And there was a further thought . Good old Marcus Harris ! Would n't lend himself to a fraud on a church  --  any church ! Bill knew that he liked his boss the better for it . " The spats arrived O. K. and thanks , " he said . " What do you want us to do next , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harris had just come from the solving of " what to do " about transplanting five hundred immigrants to mid-Western farms , but the turning of two statues in a country church was beyond his grasp ! " I guess we 've got something pretty big on our hands ! It 's bigger than I am ! You 'd better be the boss on this job  --  I mean miracle  --  . from now on . " " You 're still the big boss and O. K. , " said Dunnigan , " only don ' get me wrong again , Marcus . And ' big ' is right about what has ha  --  pened up here ! I 'm in Nanticoke , seven miles away , and it 's al even this place is talking of . Our Olga Treskovna and The Garde of the Soul ' will be played up in every news sheet in the land , or I do n't know newspapers ! The miracle do n't worry me . It 's ou next move  --  the funeral  --  that 's got me buffaloed . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the funeral ? " asked Marcus Harris . W. there some new trouble in the air ? " Nothing wrong , " said Bill , " but it 's day after tomorrow , and want to do something unusual . " It 's like this , Marcus . We 've served up a swell news-meal so far Real Cinderella stuff for the cocktail ! Appetizing bells for th entree ! A miracle for the solid meat course ! I take no credit f. that . Now , what are we going to give ' em for dessert ? You and must n't fall down from here on . I like to finish what I start ! do you ! " " There 's that Polish Ambassador , " suggested Marcus Harris . " We 're not going backwards , " laughed Bill , " backwards to that jinx or any other jinx ! "   " You 'll think of something unusual , " said the producer with confidence . " That 's it . Something unusual ! But I think too much of this girl , and this church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You use your bean , Marcus . I 'm pounding mine . We 've got to top a miracle for news values ! " " Maybe there 's some other important people who might attend , " said Marcus Harris without conviction . " That is n't a bad thought . You do n't by any chance know the governor of Pennsylvania ? " " I do n't even know who is the governor , " confessed Mr. Harris . " The leader of Tammany Hall is a friend of mine  --  and the New York Commissioner of Police . " " I 'm afraid they would n't help , " said Bill . " I will come myself , " said Mr. Harris . " You 're aces high with me , Marcus , " laughed Bill again , " and you 're a big shot in the industry , but you 're not yet a national hero with the masses . Also , you 're what they 'd call in the law an interestedparty . I want you here , but for once I 'll have to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been called to the outer office , had at this point burst in again , and by gesture evinced a strong desire to speak . " Hold on a minute , Bill , " said Marcus Harris . " Yes , Miss Feinberg ? " to the bursting secretary . " The manager of the Music Hall is outside , and the vice-president of the Intercity circuit ! I think they want to ask about booking The Garden of the Soul ' ! " she said in one breath . Such great ones had never before come with their hats in their hands . " Bill , " said Marcus Harris , " stay right where you are ! Give me the number . I 've got to see a couple of the boys I do n't want to keep waiting . I 'll call you back inside half an hour . I may know something more by then . " " I 've some things to do and I 'll be here again at twelve-thirty . Main telephone office , Nanticoke . Same town as the good old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling , for I must get back to Coaltown . The excitement there may be too much for my pal , the priest . I 'm glad he let them take his picture , but I 'm worried about that bishop fellow ! "   " They 're both smiling in the picture ! " said Marcus Harris . " That 's good ! " said Bill . " Thanks ! That makes me feel easier . And it reminds me . There 's one thing I want you to do at once . Send out and buy the finest altar cloth in New York . Buy half a dozen of ' em ! I think Barclay Street is the Catholic supply district  --  or near St. Patrick 's . The very finest , you understand . I wish there was one made of pure gold threads ! No price is too much to pay . It 's a small altar , about seven feet long . You bring them with you when you come Friday morning . Do n't leave till then . The hotel is no Biltmore and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . I 'll stay close here . Remember  --  a Catholic altar cloth . Do n't make a mistake and bring up a Jewish one ! " " I 'm writing it down , " said Marcus Harris . " Miss Feinberg -- a Catholic altar cloth  --  seven-foot altar  --  to fit the priest in the picture  --  half a dozen of them ! " Bill could hear the obedient Mr. Harris repeating . " Price no object . Do n't make mistake and bring Jewish one . " Then to Dunnigan again , " Say . do I ever buy cheap props ? " " Good lord ! These are not theatrical props ! They 're the real thing ! For the altar of this church . " " Right ! Miss Feinberg , note must be guaranteed the real thing ! I 'll get them myself , Bill . I 'll take my wife to help select them . " " Hold on ! " said Dunnigan . " I think you 'd better do it yourself , Marcus . This church is very quiet and simple . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em for , like you and me . " " Maybe you 're right , " sighed Mr. Harris , and glanced grimly about his private office . " Thanks , Bill . A man 's taste is best for another man ! But wait  --  I know a fellow who might get us some wholesale -- - " " Not on your life ! " broke in Dunnigan . " I once bought an overcoatthat way ! And Marcus " " Yes , Bill . " " Ever hear of Saint Michael the Archangel ? " " I 've been reading about him in your miracle news . 1 he priest seems to have given the Associated Press quite an interview on the subject . " " Great ! Fine ! Another good build-up for Super Pictures , Inc. ! " " For Super Pictures , Inc. ! " " You bet ! You read up some more about this Saint . Get out your Bible and read ! Go to your synagogue and find out ! Be/cause  --  " and Bill Dunnigan had at last hit on a real idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feature film about that guy ! Good-by , Marcus  --  talk with you again in half an hour . " " But wait , Bill ! This Saint Michael 's been dead a long time , and the public wants live , up-to-date subjects ! " " He 's the livest , up-to-datest guy you ever met ! " cried Bill . " All you and I have got to do is to try to keep up with him . Do n't argue , Marcus . I 'll make a real producer of you yet ! " " 0 . K. Good-by  --  boss ! " said the voice from the blond desk in Radio City , with a happy laugh in it now . The sharp click of the receiver being hung was a reassuring one . The Napoleon of the Industry was in top form again . Bill Dunnigan emerged from his soundproof , airproof booth . He left word he was expecting a call in half an hour and would return . He would go to see the setup of his " 5:45 Mass " cards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned over this new inspiration in his mind . A film about Saint Michael ! Not an ancient story , except as the background , but a Saint Michael that was still the fighting championand took part in the destinies of living men ! One might not have thought his mind was on such a subject as he emerged into the street . He was singing softly : " A pretty girl  --  is like a melody ! " But that was always Bill Dunnigan 's Song of Victory . If only he could now hit on a real inspiration about the funeral . The funeral ! For the world it was fast becoming a spectacle  --  he was doing all he knew to make it that  --  the burial of the film star who has caused a miracle to happen ! What had he just said to Marcus Harris ? It was all a news-meal , and they must now devise a stirring , world-shaking dessert ! Thus thought the **30;1669;TOOLONG agent for " The Garden of the Soul . " But there was another William Dunnigan . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him ? When the coffin was lowered into the open grave  --  when the cold , black earth was shoveledback  --  when he heard the thud ! thud ! on the coffin lid  --  when Father Paul had repeated the final words . Would Olga Treskovna be gone forever ? Bill Dunnigan stopped his song abruptly . A chill gripped his heart . As he stood silent on the Square in this strange town , the faint sound of the Coaltown bells reached his ears . And with those bells came a voice he knew . It was just her voice this time  --  he looked to see but she was not there beside him . " I 'm still at the cemetery , Bill . You know I 'm not in that coffin . I 'll not be in it  --  really  --  when they bury it deep . I 'll be standing with you  --  holding your hand . " Sometimes , maybe , I 'll go there  --  at night when you 're asleep  --  when you 're working hard during the day  --  when you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want you going about sighing for me every minute ! You have your work to do . But whenever you want me , I 'll come to you . I told you I 'd be with you always . I 'll come back to New York when you need me there . I 'll be in Holly wood if you need me there . We 're still going to do a lot of things together , Bill , my darling ! " I was frightened this morning , but I 'm all right now . I 'm glad the statues turned , for it will help Father Paul . I like Father Paul . I 'm sending a little message to him , Bill . From up here at the cemetery . " " What message do you mean , kid ? " he asked . " He 'll tell you when you get back to Coaltown . I 'm telling you so you 'll know I really sent it . Do n't be unhappy , Bill . There is n't any death , when there is someone who loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of the distant bells . But Bill ( White Spats ) Dunnigan had been told the secret of immortality , that secret that is not the property of any race , any Koran or Bible , any creed . That secret only born of love in the human heart that can transcend Death itself ! That new Dawn that must follow as bright Day succeeds the Night . He crossed the Square to his printer . Several who noticed him glanced a second time at the radiance that seemed to spring from his eager face . And he wondered what kind of message it would be that Olga Treskovna would send to Father Paul.  | . BACK IN COALTOWN , Father Spinsky also had not failed to hear the news of the St. Michael 's miracle . He heard of it first at about six A.M. when his sister Mary shouted it through his bedroom door . The phrasing of the announcement recalled only too blatantly his former attitude of antagonism toward this humble building that seemed to be suddenly in the hands of a supernatural power . His sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to get the best of Father Paul you 'd better be on the move ! They say a miracle has happened at his church ! The whole silly town is on its way there already ! " She did not wait for a reply . She was provoked with her brother . He was the silliest one of the lot . What had gotten into him ? Lying down to this weakling Father Paul ! And after eighteen hours of meditation , she was very angry with herself for sending the best chocolate cake she had made in weeks to the two people doubtless responsible for this latest act of upstart effrontery ! For such it seemed to her . If miracles were to happen in Coaltown , they should occur in a church worthy of them , and where there was a priest worthy of them . St. Leo 's . She had the initial news from the brother of their sexton who had come to take his shift at the bell rope . This man had to pass Father Paul 's church on his way to St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exciting moment of the discovery of the statue turning . He had managed , with the first corners , to get a look at these statues , so he knew their turning to be a fact . He then hurried on , not to be late at his job of bell tugging , and to bring the startling tidings to the St. Leo 's parish house . Father Spinsky did not respond with his usual aggressive efficiency . He did not leap from his bed and stamp down to get further facts , then take appropriate action thereon . He arose very slowly . Subconsciouslyhe had been expecting some untoward event . It had come ! His anxieties of the afternoon before had not been groundless . He was always up at six-thirty . On Wednesday mornings he himself had a Mass at seven . He commenced to dress slowly . From his window he could see and hear people hurrying past . Undoubtedly something quite unusual had happened . He was anxious to know what it was , but he was almost afraid to know ! He would not have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town . Walking and conversing with humanbeings ! Had a new , great cathedral risen during the night in the place of the tumbledown edifice bearing that name ? He listeneda moment to the bells and could distinguish the high , sweet tone of Father Paul 's metal clarion . St. Michael 's bell , at least , was the same ! His own bell was tolling also . No avenging army of winged warriorshad descended to destroy St. Leo 's . Destroy it as the evil donjonthat had sheltered one who in deed and thought had tried to blot out the rival chapel of the greave-clad Saint . When he finally descended his stairs he still asked no questions . He had come to the kitchen , as was his habit , to shave  --  that beingthe only place where the water was hot so early in the morning . The sister was inwardly bursting with a full report , gathered not only from the relief bell-sexton but later from the neighbors . She waited for the eminent satisfaction of being able to answer every question in minute detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could keep silent no longer . She poured it out to him in a flood . Even then he made no comment except to say , " Thanks . " He was indeed thankful  --  relieved to hear that-omnipotent efficacy , had been satisfied with so simple a thing as the turning of two statues ! " What are you going to do now ? " demanded the sister at the end of her voluble reporting . As she talked she had been viciously mixingeggs and butter and flour in a large bowl . " I 'm making another cake , " she said , " and this one stays here for us ! For our stomachs ! Fine thanks we are getting for being generous ! Statues turning indeed ! This map at the Wyoming Hotel and his money ! You can hire anything to .  --  done with money ! IfP337I were you , brother , I would see him at once and demand an explanation . I would go to the Squire and tell him what I suspect ! " She was saying this , curiously enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling Bill Dunnigan , " You 're under arrest ! " " Mary , " said Father Spinsky heavily ( he was now drying his face ) , " I must ask you , I must demand of you , that you voice no more such thoughts . " " I shall speak my mind and it 's time you spoke yours ! " said the woman with increased vehemence . As she kneaded the mixture for the new cake , the recollection of the hard labor put into the one of yesterday again rankled her soul . " When I think of my trotting up to that filthy St. Michael 's parish house , going to that awful hotel , to deliver our food  --  our food to two ingratesA sudden , blind fury seized Father Spinsky . A fury and a fear . He dropped his face towel ; he strode to his sister and grasped from her hand the large bowl in which she was mixing the cake ingredients . He raised it above his head with his two hands and dashed it to the floor . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecryspread like Gluttony incarnate , disemboweled ! The sister stood open-mouthed  --  too startled to resist . " Evil ! " cried Father Spinsky . " Only evil ! A cake made with thoughts like yours is poison . It would poison this house ! It would poison St. Leo 's ! Make no more of them . Cook for me no more until you have cleansed your heart ! " " Why , brother ! " the woman gasped . She had seen him angry before  --  when he had first heard of Father Paul 's five forty-five Mass  --  when he had heard that this priest had brought " visiting nurses " from Scranton  --  when he had learned about the " absolution " of a Jewish peddler -- but never had he raised his voice in anger at herself . Father Spinsky stared at the mess he had made about the kitchen floor . His anger fled as quickly as it had risen . He realized the absurdityof his act . Absurd , but perhaps it was the only way his sistercould be impressed . He went to where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes . " Mary , " he said , " I 'm sorry . Forgive me . I am under a great strain . I am not myself . I should not blame you . For you have been living with an evil man for twenty years . That man is me .   Selfishness , hatred , revenge , pride have ruled my heart . I have taught them all to you . I have taught them perhaps to my whole parish ! It is my fault entirely . Try now to understand . I am no longer seeking to get the best ' of Father Paul . I am not worthy to be an altar boy in his sanctuary . And this man , as you call him , at the Wyoming Hotel . I have a strange fear and a strange premonition . Perhaps he is just a rich man carrying out the wishes of a dead friend . Perhaps he is something more than that . I do not know . But I do know he has shown me myself as I really am . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angered , I turn on those I love . " I will go now to say my Mass , though I am unworthy ! Maybe God will forgive me because I know I am unworthy . Cook for me still , Mary . Have my breakfast when I return . But try to prepare it with love  --  with charity in your heart . From now on , Mary , we live differently  --  or we do not live ! God help us , we were better dead ! Ve have been dead these ten years of my pastorage in Coaltown ! And before . " Father Spinsky put on his cassock . He looked again at his sister . He moved to her and bending down , kissed her on the forehead . This woman had given up her life to his comfort . She had not married to take care of him . For the first time in his life he felt a tenderness toward this sister . He had accepted her services as his natural right . He had selfishly used her as he had used all others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mary , " he said . " I ask your forgiveness for what I have done to you . " And he went quickly from the room and across the lawn to his church . Mary Spinsky did not entirely understand . Like her brother she was a stolid , granite type . A lifetime 's habit of thought could not be changed in a single three minutes . She was not discontented with her lot . She adored her brother . In spite of what he said , he was not " evil . " He was great and good ! He had kissed her . That was what mattered most . But he was certainly not himself ! She was no longer angry with Father Paul . Somehow she connectedthis new tenderness with Father Paul . The fear in her brother 's heart was not apparently due to anything the pastor of St. Michael 's had done . It was due to this stranger stopping atP339the Wyoming Hotel . This man William Dunnigan to whom she had taken the other half of the chocolate cake . How had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upright life was wrong ? Who was this Dunnigan person to upset and disturb Father Spinsky ? If she no longer hated Father Paul , a double measure of hatred welled up against this stranger in the town . As she cleaned up the mess about her otherwise spotless kitchen floor , she made up her mind to personally see this man and demand by what right he had destroyed the even tenor of their lives . She determined to find out by what witchcraft he had caused a man of God to lose faith in the righteousness of his world and life ! She must protect her brother from whatever sinister spell this man had cast over him . But she would move carefully . She must not let her brother suspect any such plan . When she had fathomed the cause of all this she would bring him back to his normal , confident self . Meantime Father Spinsky entered his church . It was strangely empty . It was absolutely silent except for the great bell tolling above . The sound of that bell seemed to emphasize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don his vestments . He put them on alone . When , promptly at seven , he moved into his sanctuaryand turned to make the sign of the cross to the worshipers , there were no worshipers there ! Not a single person sat in the spacious pews . The miracle at St. Michael 's had drained the town . Father Spinsky winced . He felt a strange dryness in his throat . He had never before had such an experience . He recalled how he had laughed , how he had gloatingly sneered when he had heard that Father Paul 's early Masses often had not a solitary worshiper in attendance . He knew now how Father Paul must have fell : the first time it occurred . But perhaps Father Paul had not suffered ! Father Paul was at peace with his God . Father Paul had no memories of cruelties , of petty injustices to mar his inner tranquillity . Content was from within . Strength was from within . Father Spinsky went through his Mass . He did not hurry but gave each word its full sonorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and solemnity not too often usual with him . Strangely enough , he felt that he was acquiring a new strength . The strength of humility . The joy of humility ! He had never known humility . At the very end he looked out into his church . He looked again and passed his hands before his eyes . Three candles were burning at the small shrine of Saint Joseph by the door ! Just as he had lit three candles the afternoon before . They had not been burning when he had commenced his service ! Of that he was certain . There seemed to be a figure kneeling at this shrine . It was in the shadow and he could not see it clearly . And as he looked , it arose and moved toward the doorway . The figure seemed vaguely familiar . It was a man in miner 's clothes . There was a bulge under the arm toward the altar , as if the man were carrying a package . The door opened , and for a moment the figure was silhouetted against the bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bulge under the man 's arm was . It was an ac-cordion ! And Father Spinsky knew who this figure reminded him of . Stanislaus Trocki ! T'he father of the girl who had caused the miracle up at St. Michael 's . The man he had caused to be arrested for his drunken sleeping on St. Leo 's steps . The man had been clutching the accordion that morning , even in his stupor . Father Spinsky remembered that the sight of it had increased his furious resentment . But Stanislaus Trocki was dead ! He had been dead for more than four years ! The bells were ringing partly for this man 's memory . Nevertheless , Father Spinsky called out : " Stanislaus ! Stanislaus Trocki ! Wait ! " ' There was no answer . The door closed . The figure was gone . Terror struck the priest 's heart . But it was a terror urging action . He rushed through the gate of his altar rail and down the aisle of the church . He opened the great door . He half expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving him anotherchance to right that horribly unjust act !  |p341Stanislaus  Trocki was not there . He was nowhere to be seen . People were passing , among them miners on their way to and from work . But no miner that his straining eyes could see carried an accordion under his arm . Father Spinsky stood on the church steps and called out a little wildly : " Stanislaus ! Stanislaus Trocki ! " Some people paused and looked up at the frantic figure in the bright robes of the Mass . " Something wrong , Father ? " one miner asked . " No , no , " muttered Father Spinsky . He forced control of his emotions . " I thought I saw someone I used to know , " he repeated . He turned and went back into his empty church . He closed the door . He moved to the shrine of Saint Joseph . The three candles were surely burning . He passed his hand above them and the flame scorched his fingers . He made the sign of the cross . He sank on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph , Friend of the Sacred Heart , most chaste spouse , intercede for me ! Pray for me ! " After a few minutes he arose . He had regained his composure . There were , of course , other miners in Coaltown who played the accordion . It was a favorite instrument among the Poles . But they did not carry it abroad early in the mornings ! If they brought it out into the street at all , it was in the evening . Father Spinsky returned to his altar , took up the burse-topped chalice , and went out into the sacristy . His assistant , a part-time secretary , had by this time arrived . The assistant lived in WilkesBarreand came to Coaltown by bus each day . " I have heard , " Father Spinsky cut off the excited comments of the younger man . " There is no time for gossip . We have work to do ! " The assistant had never seen Father Spinsky laboring under such emotion . The stolid St. Leo pastor trembled once or twice as he issued his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the storeroom . Take them at once to St. Michael 's . Father Paul will need them all . There are also some extra altar racks . I meant to send them yesterday . Take them on a second trip . Use the car . Make as many trips as necessary . Tell Father Paul to use them as he thinks best.  | And when you have done all this , if he needs your help about his church , remain . Tell him I will come to St. Michael 's when I have had my breakfast . I wish to talk with him if he can spare me a few moments . " Father Spinsky returned to his parish house . He was a man of set habits and he would have eaten his breakfast had St. Leo 's itself burnt down . But he ate that breakfast in silence . His sister served him silently . She had already eaten her morning meal . As the priest finished , his assistant returned from the first trip to St. Michael 's . He had more news . " I left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I could not talk with Father Paul for the Bishop is there ! He came from Scranton ! " " I hope the Bishop is putting an end to this nonsense ! " said Mary Spinsky . " The Bishop and Father Paul had their pictures taken on the parish house steps  --  for the newspapers ! " said the assistant . But Mary Spinsky had an answer for that . She might have known ! " Trust the Bishop to push himself forward ! " she exclaimed , but a look from her brother silenced her . Mary Spinsky felt that her brother would long ago have been a bishop , had he been Irish instead of Polish . This Irish bishop was one of her numerous minor hatreds . The hatreds that made up the fabric of her life . " A reporter said the Bishop was in great form ! " continued the assistant with enthusiasm . He did not like Mary Spinsky . " Told the newsmen he hoped it was all true , and promised a statement when he finished with Father Paul . Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the church ! There 's a line for two blocks passing into St. Michael 's ! The State Troopers are keeping it in order . " " A fine thing when the Troopers have to keep order about a church ! " said Mary Spinsky . Father Spinsky at last smiled . When a man who has not smiled for a day and a night , who has done little smiling in his entire life , can smile without malice at the thing that has just enraged him , can see the humor of our human frailty , there is hope for his eternal salvation ! " Mary , " he said , " put on your best hat . We are going up to St. Michael 's to see the miracle . " P343There was nothing in this world Mary Spinsky was more eager to do . But pride would not let her admit that eagerness . Father Paul had probably sent for the Bishop . He should have sent for her brother ! " I prefer to go when I am invited , " said Mary Spinsky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He realized those would have been his exact words two days ago . " Father Paul has several times invited me to his church , " he replied . " I never went . I went to his parish house yesterday morning on an evil errand  --  to try to rob him of this opportunity , this prestige , this lifesaving revenue . And he was willing to move the funeral to St. Leo 's ! " " But why then  --  " said Mary Spinsky . But she knew why . The man at the Wyoming Hotel . Another Irish parvenu ! Well , she was not awed by this man and his money , even if her brother was . " We can all thank God that it was not moved ! " said Father Spinsky with an unusual earnestness . He turned to his sister . Into his voice there came an unaccustomed gentleness . " Are you coming with me , Mary ? I would like you to come . " It occurred to Father Spinsky that in all the years he had never asked his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride . The woman sensed also the tenderness in her brother 's tone . But that , she thought , a further sign of his sudden weakness . " I 'll come , " said Mary Spinsky . " At least we 'll not have to wait in this police line ! " " I can take you both in by the side door where I deliver the candles , " said the assistant . " No . We will go to the foot of the line , " said Father Spinsky . " But surely Father Paul would not want that ! And you might miss the Bishop , " said Mary Spinsky . " The Bishop came to see Father Paul , not me , " said Father Spinsky quietly . " I go to St. Michael 's as a simple pilgrim . As all the other people of the town are going . I take my turn . " He regarded his sister for a full moment . How loyal and able and efficient she really was ! If these traits could but be redirected toward unselfish good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town , " he continued ,   " why should n't I want her at my side ? God will forgive me that pride . " Mary Spinsky was startled . Startled and pleased . She was a handsome woman . But no one had told her so for a long time . Mary Spinsky smiled . It was almost the first smile without malevolencethat had crossed her face in many years . " I  --  I ' 11 be glad to stand with you , brother ! " she said . " But I must change my dress and my shoes . I have a new dress that I bought in Wilkes-Barre last week . It will be the first time I 've worn it ! " " Good ! " said Father Spinsky . " But wear your walking shoes . We will not use the car . The car is needed to take candle racks . " And somewhat later it was noted by the wondering townspeople that Father Spinsky , in his non-clerical clothes , accompanied by his " uppish " sister , was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It was cause for almost as much comment as was the arrival of the Bishop . Father Spinsky had never before stood in line to wait to see anything in Coaltown . And it was known that he had said he would not set foot inside St. Michael 's Church , since the time Father Paul inaugurated his early Mass without consulting him . THE TELEPHONE in the soundproof booth of the Bell Company 's Nanticoke office was ringing , and the man with the black derby at an angle was told his expected New York call was there . Bill Dunnigan had been waiting some five minutes , having returned from inspecting the setup of his St. Michael 's cards , and an appraisal of the rose blanket being made at a florist for the Olga Treskovna coffin . Both were to be ready by six o'clock that evening , were paid for , and could be collected by the Packard driver at this hour . While waiting , Dunnigan 's mind again returned to an unsolved problem . He did not like unsolved problems when they concernedp345the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and depressed him . But cudgel his brain as he would , no inspiration came on how , for the sake of the new film , he could make the funeral service of Olga . Treskovna a breathtaking news event . Breathtaking and yet having a proper dignity . Marcus Harris had suggested that prominent people be invited . Well , there were no grounds on which he could persuade either the President of the United States or John D. Rockefeller , Jr. , to attend ! Several champion pugilists even could be no help and he wanted no church dignitaries who would overshadow Father Paul . It was a knotty enigma . Inside the booth came the voice of Marcus Harris . The voice was happy . " Cheer up , Bill ! " it cried , as if there were an understanding of his press agent 's mood . " It 's my turn to have great news ! " " What great news ? " asked Mr. Dunnigan , and Marcus Harris smiled as he recognized his own glum words of half an hour ago . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ! That is , we will be before night . And it 's due to your publicity , for they certainly do n't know how good or how bad a film we 've made ! I can sign the largest booking contract I 've ever swung for a release of the picture , sight unseen , over the entire Intercity circuit ! A top straight rental , plus a big percentage ! They say if the picture is as good as the advance stuff , it will gross the biggest trade any film has yet known ! And the Music Hall here will give us a first showing . They want to view it , but they 're half sold already , and you and I know that the picture is a sockeroo ! Grade A plus ! And that Treskovnawill come close to giving the award performance of the year ! " Halfway through this song of praise the Dunnigan brain was suddenly aflame again . Not for " The Garden of the Soul . " An idea for the funeral ! The problem of what to do regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time ! He had not seen the forest for the trees , as the saying went . But now it was a forest fire ! Bill Dunnigan could never understand the insatiable interest of the public in the personalities of the stars of the theater . Why an article about the kind of lipstick used by some brainless , dancing ingenue should be more avidly read than a scholarly dissertation on the career of a great surgeon , for example . In fact , no one cared about the surgeon at all ! Even in the theater the really great ones were of less importance than a figure who had caught the popular fancy in the latest comedy . The films had developed this form of mass curiosity to an amazing degree . He remembered crossing Times Square one morning with Otis Skinner , and there was an immense crowd gazing at the window of a second-story dining room of the Astor Hotel . The magnet must . be no less than a person of national fame  --  a great statesman , a great general . It was eight-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have spent my life learning how to act , " said Mr. Skinner . " I have created half a hundred roles , but do you think anyone would give a damn if I were eating breakfast in that window ! " And the most eminent living artist of the stage smiled and shrugged his shoulders . Bill Dunnigan , film press agent , had been racking his brain to find a startling news angle for the funeral of Olga Treskovna . It had been right under his nose -- he and Marcus Harris held the answer in their four hands ! " The Intercity circuit ! Are n't they controlled by the Metropolitanpeople ? " the press agent shot back over the wire to the producerwho sat at his desk in the Radio City office . " They are ! " said Mr. Harris gleefully . " 1 was a part of it when it started . But when I broke loose I always had to release my films over A.B.O . Metropolitan was pretty sore at me for branching out again on my own . This is sure a triumph for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your turn to be sore ! " cried Dunnigan . " Good and sore ! Do n't let them have ' The Garden of the Soul ' ! " " Bill , are you crazy ! " expostulated the voice at the other end . " Do n't you realize that a first showing in all their dozens of theaters across the country will alone pay back full production costs and show a fine profit ! What do you mean ' be sore and do n't let them have it ' ! " " I mean  --  do n't let them have it  --  yet , " said Dunnigan , and an alarming thought entered his mind . " Marcus , you have n't been crazy enough to sign the contracts , have you ? " " No , " said the somewhat exasperated Mr. Harris . " You can'tP347make up complicated contracts in twenty minutes ! But I 'll be crazy enough to sign them the minute they 're back from the lawyers tomorrow morning . Why , that Metropolitan octopus has houses in New York , Boston , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not interested where their theaters are located , " interrupted the press agent . " Tell me , Marcus  --  does n't it happen they have under contract about all the men stars in the business ? " " They have most of them , " admitted Mr. Harris . " They and United . You know how I had to borrow a leading man for ' The Garden of the Soul . ' " " Good ! " said Bill Dunnigan . " You are so sore you do n't let these octopus theaters book ' The Garden of the Soul ' unless we get the use of the six greatest of these stars ! " " Good God , Dunnigan ! " exclaimed Harris , " they wo n't agree to anything like that ! Not for a dozen films ! And what would I do with six male stars ? I have n't six new stories to film . I 'd go bankruptpaying their salaries one idle month . " " Wait a minute , Marcus , " said Bill . " I mean the use of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's name can they do in Coaltown ! " " Ever hear of pallbearers ? " came the voice from the telephone booth in Nanticoke . " Pallbearers ? Sure ! I am one , " said Mr. Harris promptly , " that is , I 've often been one at our synagogue . Say ! What are you driving at ? If it 's what I think ! " " It 's exactly what you think , Marcus sweetheart , " said Dunnigan , " and I do n't know why we did n't think of it sooner ! You really suggested it . You said , ' Maybe if some important people came . ' " " I did n't mean actors , " said Marcus Harris truthfully . " I never thought of actors as being important in that way . " " Neither did I , " said the press agent , " because to us they 're not important , unless we think of ' em as important nuisances ! To you and me they 're mostly a bunch of conceited prima donnas with about all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romance , Adventure , The Great Lover , The Self-Sacrificing Hero , The FearlessKiller  --  everything that sweet public thinks it would like to be and do . You tell the Intercity people , Marcus , they can only book ' The Garden of the Soul ' on condition that Metropolitan 's six greatest pains-in-the-neck are flown here pronto to arrive Friday morning ! In pallbearer regalia ! I 'll set the hour of the funeral when I hear what time these glamor boys can arrive . " " But will six stars come  --  even if they are given permission to ? " gasped Mr. Harris . And he added , " And in the same plane ! " " After the publicity of this miracle , if I know actors , they 'll come ! " said Bill . " And we can furnish six planes if we have to , ca n't we ? I have n't spent the second half of your twenty grand - yet . It 's burning my pocket ! It will give these actors the kind of publicity they like their dear public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when you announce such a list of coffin redcaps , Marcus , it will bring every newsreel , every press association , every radio network in the East ! Maybe even some from Hollywood ! Half of them are here already , and they 'll stay till Friday sure , with this news . Bells  --  miracle  --  six great film stars in person as pallbearers  --  that 's the meal we 'll be serving up for them , and how they will lap it up ! " " Say no more ! " cried Marcus Harris , and there was awe in his voice . What a press agent ! " Another thing , " said Dunnigan , " do n't those star-hoarding Metropolitan people also have the child wonder , Shirley Bentley ? " " They do , " came the answer , " and I once turned her down ! " " All right . I think it would be kind of sweet if she were wafted here also  --  and scattered a few flowers on the grave while the cameras were clicking  --  and maybe their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right there in New York  --  could be persuaded to sing a sacred song " " I 'm on the phone to Metropolitan now ! " said Marcus Harris . ' Hot diggitty dog ! " he added to himself . In the face of such genius to felt the need of a stupendous emotional expression . ' What is it you say ? " asked Bill . " Just talking to myself ! " said Mr. Harris . " Do n't let it get you that way , " laughed Bill . " Wire me to Nanticokewhat you do ; and if you get it all arranged  --  and do n't dare tell me you ca n't !  --  release the story from New York . ' Hollywood 's salute to their newest star ! ' Tribute to immortal youth ! ' The college writers in your office ought to be able to turn out that stuff . Better still , have it come from the Coast studio . " " Let me get at it ! " cried Mr. Harris . " One thing more , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sight unseen . Two dollars a man , and a dollar each for black gloves . It seems they must wear black gloves , Marcus . Total , eighteen bucks . Do n't squawk if you find that amount on my expense account . " " Now you 're being funny , " said Mr. Harris , " do you think I care about eighteen dollars one way or the other ! " " Sometimes I do n't and sometimes I do , " said Bill . " But even if you are in a generous mood and let it pass , your damned auditor will discover it ! I can hear him now , What 's this ! Two sets of pallbearers ! Six dollars for their black gloves ! Why ? ' I 'm telling you now , why . I 've already parted with the eighteen greenbacks , and do n't think all the king 's horses could drag it back ! Good luck , Marcus boss ! Go to it ! " Mr. Dunnigan emerged from the booth in a much happier frame of mind than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The personal appearance of the leading figures out of " Casablanca , " " Algiers , " " It Happened One Night , " " For Whom the Bell Tolls , " " Mutiny on the Bounty , " " Little Miss Marker "  --  these or whatever ones they were  --  would attract attention even in New York , and here in this small town ! Too bad they could not wear the costumes of their great picture stories ! For that was how the public really worshiped them ! The imaginative Bill Dunnigan toyed a moment with this fantastic idea . No , that would not do . It was , after all , a funeral . And Olga Treskovna ? There were two Olgas , just as there are two or more of all the rest of us in spirit , in desire , in temperament . The Olga that sat on the church steps in the faded dress , her hair tied with a ribbon , her feet bare . The Olga who wanted to hurry home to cook supper for her " pop "  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that father 's grave . That Olga cared little for the world 's acclaim , for the success of a film " The Garden of the Soul . " That Olga was frightened by the crowds  --  the miracle . But there was another Olga Treskovna . The girl whom he had met in that mid-Western city on a Christmas Eve , who had gone out into the world determined to accomplish something before she died ; the girl who studied Constantin Stanislaysky , who took over Anna Gronka 's role and made good at it . The girl who fought through the sweltering heat of that desert " location " near Yuma , and would not let Bill Dunnigan down . The girl who even there in Coaltown had stood beside him in the doorway of Orloff 's funeral parlor and pointed out the Breaker and the drabness of the lives of the people there . What a change she had already brought about in those lives ! It was to this Olga that Bill Dunnigan spoke as he emerged from the telephone company building to cross to his Packard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " you must n't mind that Marcus and I may have to put on a little heat . It 's only because they do n't yet know  --  these so-called picture stars I mean . They would be proud to carry you if you 'd lived until your picture is released . If they knew now what I know  --  what I 'm sure of  --  that you 're the greatest artist of them all ! Even the most selfish of them is going to cry ' Bravo ! ' when he sees ' The Garden of the Soul ' ! And they 'll be damn glad they were asked to walk beside you , and so help their little bit in making the world know about your talent ! " You see , kid , in the theater you ca n't wait for years to be recognized . You 've got to make people understand while the show is going on ! Thank God these pictures that I used to hate can do for you what the stage could not now do . They can still make you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll love you and thrill to you ! That 's maybe , I guess , why fate took me out to Hollywood , so I could help make sure the whole world would know , as I know , my darling ! " And this is the way that you and Marcus and I can help Father Paul . The chips are down , kid , and we 've got to play our best cards ! We got to do for him what he has done for us ! We got to put him where he ought to be  --  make it so he can do what he wants to do . It 's all going to happen now , kid  --  the bells that woke them up  --  the miracle that brought them to their knees  --  the funeralthat will pull them to their tiptoes  --  then the solid smash for all of us  --  your great picture in the theaters  --  Father Paul 's great plans coming true here  --  and maybe this Saint Michael also getting the break he ought to have ! " Even " A pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his elation , his determination , as he stood a moment on the building steps listening again to the distant bells . And suddenly her hand was touching his . He turned , and there seemed still another Olga Treskovna  --  the peasant girl in the film story !  |p351Bill  Dunnigan had momentarily forgotten how gloriously beautifulshe was . Small wonder the Harris camera artist had declared that Whistler or El Greco would have thrilled to paint her . In this screen character her expressiveness was helped perhaps by the mascara on her long lashes  --  the shadows that made her blue eyes even more azure  --  the lip rouge that accentuated the sensuous , proud , utterly seductive curve of her mouth  --  the soft powder that heightened the glow of her cheeks . But beneath all this was the sensitive face with its wide brow , its delicate nostrils , its firmly rounded chin . Ah , she was glorious , glorious ! " Do you really think they 'll like me , Bill ? " she said . " I did try  --  I gave it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest pictures ever shown ! " said Dunnigan . " You 're beautiful , kid , and you can act ! " " Funny , it seems more important to me now that you think I 'm beautiful ! " How vibrant was her low voice ! " More than anything else , I want you to think I 'm beautiful  --  maybe because I know I 'm really riot ! It 's just that I learned how to make-up . The people out in the audiences wo n't he in love with me as you are , Bill . But maybe we can fool them  --  maybe they 'll think I 'm beautiful ! " The bright , noonday sunlight was pouring down on her uplifted face , on the gay peasant dress , on the brown of her hair . Surely she was there , standing on the steps , looking out into the Square of Nanticoke with its benches , its trees , its statue of a soldier of World War I. People were walking past  --  did they not also see this vision of loveliness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own vision  --  if lie were fortunate enough to have one ! And those who had no vision , to whom life was just the treadmill of working , eating , sleeping ? At least Bill Dunnigan would presentlyshare with them her loveliness , looking out from a hundred , a thousand picture screens ! Perhaps Marcus Harris could even make a picture story about her : the Coaltown beginnings  --  burlesque  --  Hollywood  --  and then the return to her hills with its church bells , its miracle ! They could call it " Breaker Girl . " But who could be found to play her role  --  to give it that strange ,  | 2 unearthly wistfulness , that glow of inner vitality that shone through her face like the undying glow of her guiding star ! " Gee , kid  --  " he started to speak , but she was gone . But Bill Dunnigan felt that his plans for the funeral had been approved . He drove back to Coaltown by way of the cemetery . There was a side road just before you reached the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plateau . The barefoot Olga had said that she was going there to put goldenrod on her father 's grave . He drew up at the iron gate . He passed down the gravel path between the simple graves , past the cross with its painted Christ , over to the fence where Stanislaus Trocki rested from his days in the mine shafts and his nights in the Coaltown bars . There was freshly-plucked goldenrod on the gravel It was placed in the form of a cross . Bill Dunnigan stared and wondered . It was the first time there had been an external , material evidence of the living presence of Olga Treskovna ! IN EVERY SMALL TOWN there is the so-called village halfwit , the boy or man who , while harmless , is considered not quite " all there . " In cities they exist also , but are lost in the multitude ; or perhaps , since most city folk are queer about one thing or another , the halfwitted go completely unnoticed . They are merely judged to be slightly more eccentric than their fellows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have very great wealth , the crackpots start newspapers ; run for public office . They are often named as being especially gifted ! Since all in Coaltown were in about the same economic stratum , there was not this barometer of property by which you could label such a person downright " rattlebrained " or pleasantly " erratic . " If you believed or reacted in strangely different ways from your neighbors , you were in danger of being held a complete fool . Andrev Denko was a tall , gangling sort of " boy " of about twentyp353five . At the age of seven , when not so tall , he had followed his father into a saloon and been hit on the head with a heavy beer glass in the midst of a scuffle . The beer glass was meant for the bartender with whom the father was having an argument as to the extension of long-term credit . The bartender knocked it from the infuriated customer 's hand and it struck the innocent bystander in the person of young Andrev . The father shortly transferred any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other spheres . He was killed in a mining accident . The mother also being dead , the boy was taken in and brought up by an older married sister . He was no trouble and caused no trouble . After the incident of the saloon , this lad avoided as much as possible the company of humans and seemed to prefer that of animals , trees , the hills and such like . He made friends with them . He began talking with them . He said they had more sense than people had . They did not eternally shout at each other . They did not get drunk . And people smiled , thought him not quite " right , " let him go his own way . It got around that a piece of the beer glass was lodged " beneath his hair . " He was at first the envy of all the other boys of his own age . He was not forced to go to school . There seemed no use wasting books on a " numbskull . " He roamed the woods and the hilltops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew the habits of every bird ; exactly when it came in the spring ; how the male bobolink and goldfinch changed from their gay mating colors to the dull shades of the female after the courting season ; how the female built the nest ; the time they migrated in the fall . He made friends with the shy bobwhite quail . He made whistles of willow and with their help could imitate any bird sound from blackbird to meadow lark . He knew every wild flower  --  where the first butter yellow dogtooth violets appeared  --  where to find the last wild rose He acquired an intimate knowledge of everything that lived or grew except that odious blot in nature 's family  --  man . He knew where the wild rabbits lived , and the squirrel and the occasional red fox and even deer . He made special friends of the skunk and took great delight in watching the mother parade with the young  --  their white tails like so many banners . There was an owl near the cemetery with whom he held long conversations at dusk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blossoms ,  | and the hills spoke of the gentle rains of the summer and the slashingwinter storms . He usually returned at night to sleep in the attic room his sister let him have . He earned his keep , as it were , with contributions of blueberries , wild strawberries , mushrooms ( and he seemed to recognize instinctively the ones not poisonous ) , chestnuts and black walnuts which no one else could ever find . The sister had to watch that he did not bring home also certain unedible objects like lizards , turtles , even chipmunks which he had found and which would stay in his pocket . Let an accident happen to any of his wild-life friends , he was an expert in repairing a broken wing , placing a splint on a broken leg . He would also eject a great pirate cowbird from the nest of a helplessthrush family . As he grew older he contributed money to the family purse . He was expert at weeding gardens , cleaning hen houses , splitting wood . Clocks had no meaning for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job till it was finished , instead of knocking off at a fixed hour . This trait alone was enough to stamp him as an undoubted halfwit . He took directly to his sister the money given him . He had no use for money . He wore the castoff clothes of his brother-in-law . His sister bought him shoes which he wore only in winter . In money he needed only a dime once a week for tobacco , which he smoked in a series of self-made corncob pipes . Was he to be pitied ? Father Paul , who knew him well , sometimesdid not think so . Andrev was the most contented person in Coaltown . He had nothing and he wanted nothing . Instead of a succession of disillusioning blows , spaced through a lifetime , as happens to most of us ; at one fell swoop the world had done its worst to him . He simply withdrew from a society based on argument , turmoil , greed . Why bother with it when the animals , the trees , the hills were so friendly ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of affluence was in horse chestnuts . Like money , they had no value in themselves . You could not eat them or make them into clothes . But he loved their shiny brown coloring . It was like polished mahogany . He brought home the largest and most beautifulones , and kept them in his attic room . He had more horsep355chestnuts than anyone else in the entire world . In winter , when he was not working or tramping the hills , he laid them out in intricate patterns on the floor of his room . He had no idea of the astronomical names for the constellations of the stars , but he memorizedtheir formations , and he would place the horse chestnuts in like formations on the floor . His ambition was to acquire as many beautiful horse chestnuts as there were stars . It was going to be the work of a lifetime ! He and Olga Treskovna , possibly also the sister of the blind organist , were the only people in Coaltown who ever looked up into the sky at night . From this too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accident to Andrev Denko had lost to the world a great . naturalist , ornithologist , sheriff , astronomer , maker of violas and other wood instruments , surgeon . Perhaps it did . More likely it simply lost another discontented coal miner ( like Stanislaus Trocki ) who would have labored ten hours a day underground , with vague feelings that there was a happier way of living but no opportunity to grasp that way . It certainly would have lost an example of perfectharmony with nature . It would have lost the incident we shall presently set down . Father Spinsky of St. Leo 's sat on one of the hard , folding chairs in the St. Michael 's parish house office . Standing in the long line , it had taken him a full hour to reach the church door . But it had been a not-to-be-forgotten hour . When the first whispered surprise was over , those in the line about him included him in their conversations as if he were just a neighbor and a friend ! Passers-by returning from the church , after rubbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warmth he had never before known . There were compliments for Mary Spinsky 's new dress . A new light came into her hard eyes . Father Spinsky realized what a barrier of un-Christian isolation , of pharisaic **33;1701;TOOLONG separation ( the day before he would have called it " respect " ) , he had erected around himself . For the first time lie felt the beginning of a desire to help these people , to be their friend . He had ceased to regard them as creatures of a mold and mentality inferior to himself . He gave no thought at all as to what they were worth to the collection basket . He had finally passed into St. Michael 's . He had forgotten how really beautiful was the interior of Father Paul 's tiny church . The quaint and warmly vivid paintings of the Stations of the Cross ! ( His own were expensive , sculptured marble groups that now seemed cold and dead . ) The lovely , inviting altar screen that made St. Leo 's towering alabaster seem only a battlement to keep worshipersat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly in a haven of love and tranquillity . And the two great statues of the miracle  --  the one of strength , the other of tenderness  --  now stood gazing toward this coffin ! Even Mary Spinsky , regarding their solidity , had doubts that the money of the stranger at the Wyoming Hotel had somehow had a hand in their turning . Father Spinsky knew about the mine shafts ; about the sinking of the foundations of St. Michael 's Church . It had been one of the reasons he had thought the building should be abolished  --  destroyed . And this explanation for the statue movement did for a moment cross his active mind . But , as in the mind of William Dunnigan , it seemed to him only as an adjunct to a miraculous happening . Both statues had turned , and at this particular hour ! And in the Archangel-protected church . It was not an occurrence to doubt  --  to require explaining . It was a very slight manifestation of power to be accepted with reverence and gratitude . Father Spinsky believed the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Saint for whom the church was named , whose undying glory this church should rightfullyuphold . What Saint Michael could have done had he chosen to really flash his sword of vengeance ! So he had knelt , more humble even than all the others , before the coffin . He murmured the prayer for the faithful dead . He thought also of this girl 's father and he again asked that soul 's forgiveness . Had he really seen Stanislaus Trocki back in his own church an hour ago ! Again , how gentle a manifestation ! With justice what a bolt from Heaven might have smitten hit , . , id his edifice ! He moved to a shrine and lit a candle . He pushed a five-dollar bill into the box for payment . He noticed that the candle rack was one that he had sent from St. Leo 's . It made him grateful  --  he was a little happier  --  thankful that this small part of his unworthy St. Leo 's was permitted to be there ! P357When he at last emerged into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door of Father Paul 's rectory . The morning before he had pulled the bell knob with almost as vicious a force as William Dunnigan had exerted on his first visit . So now he sat with Father Paul . The Bishop had gone . The sexton who had brought the Mass collections had gone . These two priests of Coaltown were alone . Father Paul was the first to speak . " I am very grateful for the candles and the candle racks , " he said . " That is kind of you . I want to pay you for the candles and I feel I should send you the money which your candle racks collect . I will send it , if I may . " Father Spinsky had a sense of the dramatic . He could not resist the framing of his next sentence . " I want much more than that ! " he said and looked sternly at Father Paul . " What more ? " said Father Paul . " I want your forgiveness for my arrogance  --  my greed . For my antagonism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He raised his hand as Father Paul started to speak . " . I want you to let me help you in the plans I know you have to help the town . I want no credit  --  I just want to help  --  if you think I can help ! " Father Paul looked hard at Father Spinsky . Father Spinsky smiled . It was a sad smile but it was sincere . " Can you forgive me , Paul ? " the St. Leo pastor said . The pastor of St. Michael reached over and took the hand of his rstwhile enemy . " There is nothing to forgive , " he said . " You had your church and I had mine . I suppose it was only natural " " It was neither natural nor Christian , " said Father Spinsky " And I also know that words are cheap and easily spoken . I have received some two thousand dollars for the ringing of my St. Leo 's hell . I will send you my check for this money . I want you to add it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a plan about visiting nurses that you tried . It was a good plan . I did all I could to discredit it . Maybe you can start that plan again . " " We can start it again , " said Father Paul . " We will start it ! " " And there is one other thing , " said Father Spinsky . " You are going to be too occupied to cook for yourself , to take care of your parsonage . Your time is valuable to this community . I want you to have someone prepare your mews -- my sister says she knows a .. P358woman of your own parish  --  my sister is a fine cook , you know , and understands about these things , as I am sure you will agree from her chocolate cake " " Her chocolate cake ! " gasped Father Paul . And now he had risen to his feet . " Why , yes , " said Father Spinsky . " Did n't she send you half a cake yesterday ? She said that she would , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wyoming Hotel . " " Good God ! " said Father Paul and sat down again . " What is the matter ? Was n't it all right ! " said Father Spinsky . " Yes , yes ! Of course ! " said Father Paul . He was on the point of telling Father Spinsky of the only message that came with that cake  --  the part about the " six eggs and a cup of butter not being wasted , " but he stopped . He realized the real source of the gift . " I mean  --  I forgot to thank you for it ! " he finished . " It was grand ! Swell ! " and he smiled . " Mr. Dunnigan is most anxious to meet your sister . He wants the recipe she uses , for it seems he isbacking a Quick Lunch in Nanticoke , " Backing a Quick Lunch ! " " Yes . A remarkable man . Helping some young Polish boy there . Goes about doing such things . Going to name their foods after Saints . I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost sacrilegious and then , that he 's a better Christian , would be a better priest than either of us , Father Spinsky ! Why , he He was about to tell Father Spinsky of the conversation in the church basement regarding the miracle , but he halted . That had perhaps best be left unsaid , at least for the present . " So you also have noticed something strange about him ! " said Father Spinsky . He leaned forward . " Father Paul  --  has it occurred to you --  " But he did not finish his sentence either . The tall , somewhat grotesque figure of Andrev Denko , the village " halfwit , " was standing in the doorway . Andrev seemed to want to speak to Father Paul . Andrey Denko had reached Father Paul by way of the back door of the parish house . He had come from the cemetery . P359He had not come by the roadway . You could climb the rail fence near the grave of Stanislaus Trocki , go down a steep , heavilywoodedhillside thick with briars and underbrush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael 's parish house garden . The lad had a sense of direction like that of a wild bird . If he wanted to go anywhere he usually disregarded such things as streets and thoroughfares and even woodland paths and proceeded to that place in a straight line . He had a message for Father Paul . He never rang a doorbell or knocked . That humans should have doors and sometimes lock them was another of the absurd peculiarities of this species . Like getting drunk . The trees , the hills , most of the animals he knew did not so barricade themselves . Perhaps because they had no dark secrets to hide ! Father Paul was one human whose door was never locked . He was used to the lad 's unannounced appearances . He had a keen sympathy and understanding of him . It was Andrev who helped each month clear the weeds from the untended cemetery graves , and along the fence borders . The boy was very expert with a scythe , but he would not use this symbol of Death in the cemetery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of the symbolic figure of the Grim Reaper . He would not use a scythe because it also cut down an occasional tall sunflower or shattered a cluster of wild arbutus . Andrev would bring a small sickle , and though the work took longer , there was not an indiscriminate destruction of both beauty and rank growth . It . was this quite unusual sensitivity that had first caused Father Paul to be drawn to the lad  --  to suspect that under the crude exterior there was something fine and unusually good . Andrev reminded him of the contradictory edifice that was his Church of St. Michael . " Yes , Andrev ? " said Father Paul . And Father Spinsky turned quickly and paused in the stating of his weird suspicion about the identity of William Dunnigan . " I want talk with you , " said Anchey to Father Paul , and the look he gave Father Spinsky meant , talk with him alone . " I will go , " said Father Spinsky rising . In a way he was glad of the interruption . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterly absurd to Father Paul . Father Spinsky realized that he was somewhat abnormally moved by his reactions of the past twenty-four hours . The vision of Stanislaus Trocki was still disturbing him . He could see Father Paul later in the day , at a calmer moment . " No , do not go , " said Father Paul . " Andrev , you can speak before Father Spinsky . Surely you know him . My brother priest of St. Leo 's . " Andrev knew Father Spinsky . Two weeks before , the St. Leo 's pastor had ordered him to stop cutting the weeds along the fence of the St. Leo 's cemetery which was just across the roadway from that of St. Michael 's . The lad had finished his task for St. Michael 's and had seen no harm in tidying up St. Leo 's . And there was a particularly gorgeous sunflower growing there that he had paused to talk with , and he wanted to be sure it would be spared by whoever did the weed cutting . Father Spinsky had been passing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working on " his property . " A halfwit Father Paul had persisted in using about the St. Michael acre . Father Spinsky 's exact order had been , " What are you doing here ? Get away ! Get away and stay away ! Do n't trespass again on my cemetery ! " Andrev had hastily withdrawn . Father Spinsky ( as well as Andrev Denko ) now remembered these words . Was there anyone in all Coaltown that the priest had not spoken to , at one time and another , in an unkindly man-ner ! " I know Father Spinsky , " said Andrev . " I know something to tell him also . But I do not like him as I like you , Father Paul . " Father Paul was about to remonstrate at this frank statement of dislike , but Father Spinsky spoke first . This seemed to be his day for confession of faults . " Andrev is perfectly right , " he said and turned to the boy . " I am sorry for what I said to you at the cemetery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quite understand . " I want to arrange with you to cut my grass along the fence each week , " said Father Spinsky . " I will pay you for it . Will you do that for me ? " This the boy did understand . He smiled .   " I 'm glad to do that ! " he said . " And I want no money . There going to be the biggest horse chestnuts in Valley on tree in your cemetery ! If I can pick what I want of them " Father Spinsky did not know what this was all about but Father Paul did . " Andrev collects horse chestnuts , " he said . " He has some very beautiful ones . " " Of course ! " said Father Spinsky . " Take whatever you wish . I will pay- you besides for the work . " " Thank you ! " said the lad . A bright smile transfigured his long , homely face . " I need your horse chestnuts for my brightest stars ! " Father Paul had viewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the expression of Father Spinsky 's face he felt it meant more than the hiring of a weed cutter to his brother priest . " His brightest stars ? " said the St. Leo pastor . " He is charting the night sky , " said Father Paul . Father Spinsky looked at this halfwit whom he had despised . This lad whom he had once or twice  --  when he had noticed him  --  thought of taking steps to have placed in an institution . Which of them was the wiser ? Which of them was the nearer Heaven ? The answer to that question gave Father Spinsky a shuddering pause . But the lad was reticent no longer . " I have just been at cemetery , " he said . The words seemed to carry more meaning than a mere statement of his whereabouts . " I 'm glad we cleared it last week , Andrev , for I 'm having a funeral day after tomorrow , " said Father Paul . " I am proud of Andrev 's work . My graves all look well ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy did not seem to hear the compliment . He proceeded with what was apparently his errand . " I been talking with Olga Trocki , Stan Trocki 's girl , " he said . " You have been talking  --  who did you say ! " said Father Paul . The priest was startled , for the matter of fact simplicity in the boy 's tone gave it a ring of truth that no excited declamation would have conveyed . Father Spinsky was also startled . He had been about to retire , for the thought of what , but for tilt1 ace of . God , he might have inflicted on this lad who " charted the night sky , " was not quieting . The priest sat again in his chair and gazed transfixedly into the curiously earnest face of the boy who stood before them . " With Olga Trocki , " repeated Andrev Denko . " I did not sec her for long time . We used to talk together at the cemetery . She went away , but she back now . We cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Perhaps the day before Father Paul would have tried to explain to Andrev Denko that he could not possibly have talked with Olga Trocki . That Olga Trocki was dead . That the funeral he had just mentioned was to be for this same Olga Trocki . But explanations seemed trivial and profitless in the face of what was now happening in Coaltown . Father Spinsky 's thoughts were the same . A day ago he would have laughed at such a tale and told its bearer to go about his business . In the case of Andrev Denko , telephoned the authorities . But now ! Father Paul said earnestly : " Are you sure , Andrev , it was Olga Trocki ? " And he had an eerie feeling , as he looked at the simple face of the lad , that the boy believed he was speaking truthfully . " Me and she are friends , " said Andrev . " I talk with her there lots of times before she went to Wilkes-Barre . She held a hurt robin while I fixed its wing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you talk about today ? " asked Father Paul , and the strained eagerness that he met in Father Spinsky 's eyes told him the St. Leo pastor was even more tense than he himself . " We talk about the rain and the hills . It was mostly about the hills . She say she missed them terrible while she away ! She say she would n't be going away for long any more again . She say she wondered always if the hills missed her , but she knew I was here to talk to them . They do n't have hills in some places , Father , she say ! ' Never leave the hills , Andrey , ' she tell me . And I tell her how old Bald Top Mountain is complaining they cut off all the trees on one side . He say he 'll be cold this winter with no leaves on his shoulders " " Andrev , " said Father Paul , " did Olga Trocki say anything about a funeral ? " " Oh , that ! " said the lad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I tell her they are saying in the town that the church bellsP363are ringing for her funeral , and she say ' Yes , I know ! I am going to be buried there by my father , like I 've always wanted . ' But she 's going to sit and talk with me sometimes when I come up alone . She say I must always be alone because the other people would not understand , and they would think me silly talking , because they could not see her ! Just like they think I 'm silly when 1 talk to old Bald Top ! I promised to put goldenrod on her grave too . And she give me something to give to you , Father Paul . " Andrev had produced from the deep side pocket of his patched , weather-stained trousers a box such as school children use to carry pencils , and handed it to Father Paul . The paint on the box was peeled off . There were bits of soil still clinging to its edges . Father Paul held the box in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at Andrev . " She gave you this herself ? " he asked . " We dig it up from the foot of her pop 's grave . It was just under the grass . She say she put it there before she went away . There 's some writing inside . She read it to me . It 's what she call a poem . She say she wanted you to have it , Father , because some of the words are just like you speak to her friend here at the cemetery . To the than who 's fixing the funeral . She was there when you talk to him . She say to tell you she was sorry she never knew you . You come after she went away . " Andrev Denko had never said so many words at one time . Now that he had said them he turned to go . " Wait , Andrev , " said Father Paul . " Please wait , Andrev , " said Father Spinsky , and pushed forward the other folding chair . The boy sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It contained a single sheet of ruled tablet paper in a roll . There was writing on it in pencil . This is what was written : HILL PRIDEA Poem by Olga TrockiOh fair the hills of my country Oh Fairer than the fair !  | Their curve is like the Virgin 's breasts ( The Christ-head rested there ) 1 think that when God moulded them He took a special care . Oh high the hills of my country Oh Higher than the high ! And from their tops a child can see The world 's end meet the sky And tall men bend their heads to letThe storm clouds scuttle by . Oh stern the hills of my countryOh Sterner than the sternTo frown on pettiness and greedAnd vice for which men burn . The heart must seek nobilityThe soul for beauty yearn . Oh sacred are my country 's hills Like Altars in a church . The pine trees stand like candlesticks Each dawn a lighting torchThat drips hot flame on altar cloth Of hickory and birch . Oh strong the hills of my country Oh Stronger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of crushing wrong . And we who stay --  -- and are content Find victory and song . Father Paul read it through . His thoughts indeed ! And his imagery about the pine trees being candlesticks and the hickory and birch trees forming an altar cloth ! Only , she spoke of the sunrise and he spoke to William Drunnigan of the setting of the sun behind the hills . Father Paul handed the paper sheet to Father Spinsky . As Father Spinsky read , the St. Michael 's priest spoke again to the lad now seated on the chair . " Do you remember what is here , Andrev ? " he asked  | " I do n't remember all , " he answered , " though it was all beautiful . Someday I want you teach it all to me  --  I 'd like to tell it to the hills . It would cheer up old Bald Top Mountain  --  the part about the hills protecting us from the world . He sometimes think he is no use to the world  --  he is so old  --  old Bald Top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall men bend their heads to let the storm clouds go by . ' I was on mountain one time and the black thunder clouds come all around me ! " Both Father Paul and Father Spinsky knew that Andrev could not read or write . " It is beautiful , " said Father Paul . " You are sure , Andrev , you have not shown it to anyone ? " " I bring it straight to you  --  right after I speak to her father " Her father ! " It was Father Spinsky who asked the question . He looked up sharply from his reading of the composition of the dead daughter of this dead man . His voice was strained . He had the look of one suddenly struck full in the face . " Yes , " said Andrew . " Her father come at end of our talking . He come walking down the path . He have his accordion . He play a song she liked and she sing it . It was a fine song  --  about a dying Polish soldier who wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us he going to your church to light three candles , Father Spinsky . He say he once make a lot of trouble for you . May I go now ? There is a bird nest that fall down yesterday . I put it up best I could . I must see if it is all right . " " You may go , " said Father Paul . " Thank you for bringing me the poem . And Andrew " " Yes , Father ? " " I would say nothing about this to anyone , if I were you . " " I do not talk to people about my friends , " said the lad scornfully . " They would laugh . I come to you because I know you would not laugh . You will teach me the poem ? " " I will teach you , " said Father Paul . The boy went as he came  --  through the back of the parish house . When he had gone Father Paul spoke first . " I suppose this man he believes he saw might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said to Father Spinsky . " It is very strange , however . "  | He noticed that Father Spinsky was staring straight ahead . Lookingthrough him  --  beyond him . The St. Leo priest glanced again at the verse he still held , then focused his eyes on Father Paul . Eyes that reflected a kind of fearful resignation . " The man was no passing miner , " said Father Spinsky . " Paul  --  I saw Stanislaus Trocki in my church hardly more than an hour ago ! " BILL DUNNIGAN , gazing at the goldenrodon Stanislaus Trocki 's grave , did not , of course , yet know about Andrev Denko . The lad had long since gone . By the time the press agent reached the St. Michael 's parish house , Andrev had also come and gone from there . And Father Spinsky had departed . Dunnigan got out of his Packard and for a moment looked up and down a new Main Street . There seemed no diminishing of the number of people in the line stretching for a block to St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood and edged slowly forward . On the opposite side of the street the Troopers had permitted cars to park , and they presented a solid , slanting front ( or to be more accurate , a rear ) , for at least a half of the full mile of the town . Fresh cars were arriving each few minutes . Visitors and natives were milling about the street . The four lunchrooms were serving hungry strangers with more food than they had sold in months . Several Bars and Grills were actuallymaking sandwiches ! The whole was not unlike some Western town in an agricultural region on the clay set apart for marketing and trading . But the lure to Coaltown was not barter but a neglected church where a miracle had occurred . Dunnigan also found a new Father Paul . The priest had taken an eager batch of newly-arrived reporters into the church through the side door , and was giving another talk about the fighting qualities of Saint Michael . A national photographic press service was taking more pictures of the two statues that had turned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treskovna coffin . Standing in the same doorway where he had watched a fearful and uncertain Father Paul celebrate a Mass a few short hours before , Bill Dunnigan was happily amazed . " What has happened to you , Father ! " he exclaimed , when he and the St. Michael pastor were finally alone in the parish house for a humble lunch of coffee and cheese and jam which the little pastor , talking all the while , had himself prepared . " Much has happened this morning , " said the priest . " Most wonderful of all  --  my Bishop was here ! " " I heard that from New York , " said the press agent , " and it had me worried for awhile . " " From New York ! " gasped Father Paul . " Yes , " said Bill , " your fame has reached New York . Yours and Saint Michael 's . Not to mention the Bishop 's . All three of you made the front pages they tell me . " Father Paul put down his cheese and swallowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat . The first page of New York newspapers ! But he took a deep breath . He took a firm grip on himself . " The front page  --  good ! " he said . He was sure now he had conquered fear . And the next moment both he and Bill Dunnigan laughed . Then Father Paul told of the visit of Andrev Denko . He recited the lad 's words about Olga Treskovna . He handed William Dunniganthe paper that was in the pencil box , the paper with the poem called " Hill Pride . " Dunnigan read it through . His eyes were , t little misty at the end . It brought back vividly that hour in the Hollywood hospital when she told him of her longing for her hills . He remembered her words in Ming Gow 's Chinese restaurant  --  the first time she had spoken them  --  and the ardent , wistful look in her blue eyes . The blue of her eyes was of the distant hills rather than the sky , he suddenly thought . " I love the hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had sent him to New York  --  the girl who stood atop her mountain and looked at the star . " Your hills were really her mother ! " he said at last . " This verse is how she felt about them  --  and the handwriting is hers . She used to joke with me because I did n't like hills . 1 did n't know much about them then . I have learned . I think the hills have gotten under my skin too . Into my blood . And I knew there was to be a message here from her . " Father Paul waited but Dunnigan did not explain . After a moment the priest said : " You knew one other thing I did not know  --  or did you ? The name of the maker of the chocolate cake ! " " Yes , f knew that . In the excitement this morning I forgot to tell you . And I must ask you for an indulgence forgiving gluttony ! I ate it all  --  that is , with some friends of mine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Father Spinsky was here . " " Did he come to collect for the six eggs and the cup of butter ? " Father Paul arose and paced his floor . Then he turned to his friend . " It is only natural that you should ask that . T also was sure he wanted something when he appeared . He did , Bill . He wanted my forgiveness . Mine ! He wanted to turn over to me the money 1 he has received for the ringing of his bell . For my plan about 1 visiting nurses . Something out of the ordinary has happened to him ! He believes that he saw Stanislaus Trocki in his church ! Andrev Denko also says he saw this man  --  but Andrev is a child at heart with a child 's imaginings , while Father Spinsky is a grownman , a very practical grown man ! " Bill Dunnigan was about to light his cigar . He let the match burn out in his hand . " I was out ahead , ' as we say , of another play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get tired of hearing me talk about my plays ! But sometimes I think there is really nothing new in life , if one is around the theater . It has all happened in the plays the great ones have set down ! This script was by the greatest word artist of them all , I guess . With your education you know this play better than me . I never did see it all through . But Bob Mantell wore black tights and said : There are more things in heaven and earth , Horatio , Than are dreamt of in your philosophy . ' I always liked those lines , and remembered them . "   " Yes , I know , " said Father Paul . " It was spoken about the ghost of Hamlet 's father . " " Only Olga Treskovna is not a ghost ! " exclaimed Dunnigan . " I saw her just awhile ago in the bright sunlight of noon on the Square in Nanticoke. 1 have seen her here in Coaltown  --  on your church steps  --  inside your church  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you at her father 's grave . I saw her in Hollywoodafter she died ! She lives , Father ! If I did not think she still lived , I would not want to live ! " " Knowing you , I can not think your belief is other than good , " said Father Paul . " And whatever it is that Father Spinsky believes  --  he seems to have some ideas about you , Bill , that are a little strange , , " About me ! " " He has not said just what they are . He was about to tell me , I think , when Andrev Denko came . In his case I think it is a great fear ! But if fear has brought about this change in him  --  it seems that you are the one who has changed him  --  perhaps great fear also can fathom the Beyond . In Andrev Denko 's case it is a great simplicity . Perhaps I do not see , " and the priest smiled a little sadly , " because I have achieved no greatness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Dunnigan . " Whatever good there is in all these happenings is because of you ! It was your courage that set me going again  --  it is your example alone that brought about the change in Father Spinsky --  " Father Pahl shook his head . " It was not I who brought about Andrev Denko ' , , keen perception , or any of the other unusual things , " . he said .. " 1 shall perhaps I now that , I have achieved the grace of greatness when 1 , too , have .1 vision of the things unknown , And that , I 'm afraid , will newt be ! " " Don't. be too certain ! We shall sec ! " said William Dunnigan. press agent for Saint Michael as well as for " ' The Carden of the Soul . " " But tell me , Father . what did your Bishop say ? It worried me at first when f heard that he was in Coaltown . Then I was told from New York that he was smiling in the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " On the first page ! " smiled Bill Dunnigan . " I 'm glad the Bishop was there . Thank God for that ! " But.  |p370Father  Paul was also smiling . " I do n't think I ever quite knew my Bishop before , " he continued . " He is right with us , Bill  --  with you and me  --  and our blessed Saint Michael . He 's coming to the funeral Friday and will preside in my sanctuary ! He made one condition , however , that I do n't know if you can manage . " " What condition is that ? " asked Dunnigan . " This film of yours  --  you 've got to have it shown at least a week before New York in his cathedral city ! " " We 'll show it a month before if necessary , " said Bill with a laugh . " But what does he think about our miracle ? " " I think , " said Father Paul , " that he believes a bigger and finer miracle than any mere turning of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul in all Coaltown ( if we eliminate the Breaker , who , black of countenance , growled defiance anfi disdain at all this talk of " miracles " ) was Mr. James Orloff , proprietor of Orloff 's Funeral Parlor . His lot it was to see no visions , nor to experience any joy or anguish of regeneration . His not to share one pulse beat in the universal feeling of uplift ! Excitement in the town had reached a fever heat , but nobody ( lied of it . On the contrary , everybody was gloriously alive . Invalids who had been bedridden for years , and might be expected to be customers any day , were up and on their way to St. Michael 's ! Money was pouring into everybody 's coffers , except Orloff 's . Restaurantsand saloons were hearing a constant ring of cash registers as well as that of church bells ! Half the townspeople were renting rooms till after the funeral ! The Wyoming Hotel was filling up with newsmen ! Even the Orloff poolroom was deserted , for greater wondering% than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets were in the air ! And a modern Midas , whom Orloff felt he might have had solelyp371for his own , was scattering gold in all directions , except the one direction in which it should fall for a funeral ! Mr. Orloff could stand the strain no longer . He decided to call on Mr. Dunnigan . He must report on the important matter of the six pallbearers . There the undertaker had pulled off a minor financial success . He had found that instead of paying them , individuals were willing to pay him to gain the distinction of lifting the coffin of Olga , daughter of the late Stan Trocki . Mr. Orloff had collected ten dollars each from six gentlemen of his acquaintance for that privilege . He also had thought of another idea which would add a few more dollars to his lamentably small gain from this world-shaking , **27;1736;TOOLONG transaction . Mr. Orloff did not know of Maude Muller ; had never heard of John Greenleaf Whittier and those saddest words of tongue or pen ; but " it might have been ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Dunnigan shortly after lunch time at the Wyoming Hotel . The press agent was reading a telegram his " chauffeur " had sped back from Nanticoke to bring . The Nanticokeoperator had hailed the Packard returning from the St. Michael rectory  --  dismissed until it should bring , at six , the " Mass show cards " and the coffin roses . The smile on Mr. Dunnigan 's face indicated that the wire brought pleasant news . There are individuals to whom the only ground for respect is the possession of money . Mr. Orloff was of that ilk . He removed his hat as he now approached the fabulous man that he alone ( and alas ) held in his clutches two days before , as that man climbed down from a day coach at Wilkes-Barre out of the West ! Mr. Orloff would never again judge people by day coaches . Mr. Dunnigan was now asking the desk clerk for his room key . " May I speak to you privately , Mr. Dunnigan , sir ? " asked the undertaker . He finished this respectful request with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his telegram . " Well , well ! If it is n't my old buddie , Jimmy Orloff ! " he said . " I heard from our mutual friend Father Spinsky that your health was failing . I 'm happy to see you up and about again ! We do n't want you having to bury yourself , do we ? No profit in that at all ! "  | Mr. Orloff responded to this hail-fellow pleasantry with a hollow , dolorous noise meant for a laugh . It was not entirely successful . The sight of the now quite immaculate Mr. Dunnigan was a sickening one to his eyes . He was acutely conscious of a cavernous void both in his wallet and the region of his stomach . " I am feeling better , thank you , though not entirely recovered , " he managed to say . " Good ! " exclaimed Mr. Dunnigan . " Very good ! Then you 'll be O. K. for the funeral Friday . That 's the big day . It 's turning out to be quite an event , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you look worried . Come right up to my room and unburden your anxious heart to me ! " The press agent reread his telegram , smiled again , placed the yellow paper in his side pocket . " Just wait with the car ! " This to the Nanticoke chauffeur . Mr. Orloff shuddered visibly . This further reference to affluence was more salt on open wounds . The Packard was already a much-pointed-out millionaire 's chariot in Coaltown . He followed Dunnigan up the stairs into the front A-i . Bill motioned to a chair , and himself sat on the bed . He adjusted his black derby at a little more jaunty angle than heretofore . Mr. Orloff sat down gingerly and held his soft hat in his hand . " Well ? " said Mr. Dunnigan . " I 've arranged about the pallbearers , " said Mr. Orloff . " I 've persuaded six friends of mine to serve . And what I want to speak , to you about is the black gloves " I paid for the gloves  --  a dollar a pair  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sternly . " I have your receipt somewhere . " " Oh , that is n't what I mean , " said Mr. Orloff , and he attempted to put a lightness  --  a " what is a receipt among friends " note  --  into his tone . " I wanted to say that I think the dollar gloves will be too cheap for such a funeral as you are planning . I 'm afraid I did not at first understand how first-class you wanted things done . There is a make for four dollars that will look much better and " Mr. Orloff had worked out a neat two-dollar profit on the better gloves . Twelve dollars in all , as against a ten-cent profit only on each pair of the dollar kind . But Mr. Dunnigan interrupted.  | " Dear , dear ! " he said . " I 'm sorry you 're put to all this worry ! And on top of your ill health ! You certainly have my interest at heart ! " Mr. Orloff made a deprecatory gesture . " I 'm only trying my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathetic listener . " Rest easy , pal . You 'll need to supply no gloves at all ! In fact , I can cheer you now by the helpful news that you wo n't have to supply even the six pallbearers ! I can imagine the difficulty you 've been having in finding six reputable citizens willing to do that job . " He got up and looked from the window to the street where he could easily see the tail end of the line progressing toward St. Michael 's . " But you have to have pallbearers ! " gasped Mr. Orloff . He also arose . In spite of Mr. Dunnigan 's smile and his unexpectedly cordial manner , the undertaker had a premonition of dire , naked disaster ahead . " I know that , " said Bill . " Coffins have to be carried somehow ! They wo n't walk alone ! Ha , ha ! But I should not joke about so serious a matter ! And I realize your devotion to an agreement and what a time you were probably having about it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one and that ! Rebuffs on every side ! A girl with no friends in the town . Her late father in ill repute . So I 'm happy to be able to tell you that I just have word  --  " and he produced his telegram , "  --  that some fellow film players of hers are coming gallantly to the rescue . They fly here from California by special plane and will arrive at Williamsportairport Friday noon . I will have motorcars meet them . Let me see  --  " and he again consulted the telegram "  --  there will be --  " Mr. Dunnigan here read six names whose combined weekly salarieswould have indeed equaled the semi-monthly pay roll of the Coaltown mines . " I 'm quite sure , with Hollywood thoroughness , " he added , " they will be equipped with the proper funeral clothes , including black gloves ! " Mr. Orloff felt the need of sitting down again . He sought his chair with unsteady hands and legs . His stomach trouble had returned . Likewise a dizziness about the brow . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not only more evidence of titanic wealth , but sixty good dollars to be returned for non-delivery of pallbearer jobs  --  front seats , as it were , at this funeral ! Misery without end ! " But I 've already hired six men , " he gasped , " and paid them  --  in advance ! " He added the last falsehood in a weak hope of wardingoff this colossal calamity ! " My God ! " he continued  --  it could not be true  --  he must not have heard correctly  --  " You 're telling me all these motion picture stars are coming to Coaltown as pallbearers for Stan Trocki 's kid ! " By now Mr. Orloff had the appearance of a huge , over-stuffed fish out of water and sucking for air . " So I am reliably informed , most reliably , " said a calm Bill Dunnigan , and he gave the telegram sheet an airy flip . " But do n't be upset . Since you 've already paid out the money , I 'll not ask a return of the twelve bucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he unfair . I do think , however , that I should have back my six dollars I advanced to you for gloves . Especially as you apparently have not yet purchased this cheaper kind . " Mr. Orloff was trapped . ( " Hooked "  --  thought Dunnigan  --  intriguedby the beauty of the fisherman metaphor . ) Too late the undertaker realized his fatal mistake ! He should have said he had already bought the cheaper gloves and wanted now to exchange them . He thought momentarily of altering the story to that effect . Blood flushed his face under the need of instant and sharp mental effort . But he did not like the look in the city man 's eyes . Eyes that had narrowed and for the moment lost their joviality . Did the " gent " suspect what the undertaker had already done ? The gent did , if the truth were known . Dunnigan had heard certain rumors in a bar about the ten-dollar-a-pallbearer transaction . Mr. Orloff slowly took out his billfold ( did he produce it from a gill ? ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He handed the bills to Mr. Dunnigan . William Dunnigan was not a person to make a vulgar display of money . In his business it was no novelty to carry on his person sizable sums of currency to be expended for his employer 's benefit . But he could not resist letting this mortuary gentleman have a concrete view of what his petty greed had probably lost him . Andp375the press agent had not forgotten what Orloff had said about Father Paul and St. Michael 's Church . So he did not simply jam the two bills into his trousers pocket or toss them onto his bed cover . He carefully produced a large roll , smoothed it out , and placed the Orloff money in the inner sanctuary of its circumference . The glassy-eyed undertaker could not help but see that the outside bill was for five hundred dollars , and that there seemed to be quite a number of that pleasant denomination in the roll . There were about eight , in point of fact . And a sizable number of delectable hundreds cushioned these , and served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again into the pocket from which it came . Thus did William Dunnigan figuratively strike the blow he had withheld when Orloff applied the brakes to his hearse and refused to move until Stanislaus Trocki 's funeral balance was paid . The Manassa Mauler could not have landed more solidly . " Well , " said Mr. Dunnigan , " it 's nice to have seen you again . Have your hearse and one carriage , as per our contract , at the church promptly at two on Friday . Get there early , Jimmy , for there may be a few more carriages in line ! " James Orloff died hard . " I was going to speak of that , " he said desperately . " Of course , you 'll need more than one carriage for all these people , and . f could arrange at a reasonable wholesale rate " It 's all being arranged in Nanticoke , " said Mr. Dunnigan . " They 're very accommodating to me there , and do n't have to have their money in advance ; although , as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , they arc not pressed for ready cash like yourself  --  have no relatives ' dance-hall bars to meet installments on . Maybe they 're not as kind to their families as you are . But that is the price one must pay for brotherly generosity . Good day , Jimmy ! Chin up ! Gills open ! See you at the church Friday ! " And so it happened that an almost suicidally despondent James Orloff first spread the rumor that unbelievable notables of the legendary motion-picture world of Hollywood would carry the coffin of Stan Trocki 's girl from the Church of St. Michael the Archangel some forty-eight hours hence . A rumor that the afternoon near-by city papers confirmed on press dispatches from New York and Hollywood itself.  |p376BILL  ( White Spats ) DUNNIGAN started out from the Wyoming Hotel with his " Miners ' Mass " show-cards under his arm  --  just as in the old days he had gone about the towns as an " advance man , " and planted similar clarion calls to attend the theatrical attraction he was heralding . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Paul and Saint Michael . The next morning , his cards having paved the way , he meant to locate the office of the Miners ' Union , talk with its head , try to put through the idea of the Union getting solidly behind this Mass , making Father Paul its official chaplain . He felt that now , at least , he would not have opposition from Father Spinsky . And he could promise this union some swell country-wide publicity ! The first mine union to have an " official Mass " and an " official chaplain " ! It was about eight o'clock in the evening . His Nanticoke chauffeurhad brought him the show-cards and the blanket of roses . The latter he had taken to St. Michael 's , and he and Father Paul had spread it over Olga Treskovna 's coffin . As there were still people in line , Father Paul was keeping the church open till nine o'clock . Two nuns from the Wanamee Orphanage were coming to keep an all-night vigil until the next morning 's Mass . The first card went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for Dunnigan 's visit had filled the hostelry from dusty lobby to leaky roof . Cots were being placed in the parlor to accommodate the overflow . The day clerk asked for two cards . He would place one in the dining room . The press agent noted that the reporters in the lobby were reading the card and jotting down its message . He talked with several of them . " This progressive priest , " he said , " has wanted the mine workers of the district to have a service at an hour which would comeP377before they embarked each day on their unusually hazardous employment . A Mass at 5:45 A.M. Like the 12:45 A.M. Mass established at St. Andrew 's in New York for men of your own newspaper profession and other night workers . You all know about that famous service ! And Father Paul 's idea would seem to have divine sanction , for this blessed miracle was first discovered at this Mass at sunrise in Coaltown . Within twenty-four hours I hope to make an announcement from the Miners ' Union here that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you know about these famous movie stars coming for the funeral of Miss Treskovna ? " asked several newsmen . " I only know what your news tickers have probably recorded , " said Bill , for he had by then seen the afternoon Wilkes-Barre and Scranton papers . " A spontaneous recognition of an artist by the fellow workers of her craft ! It is most gratifying , gentlemen , most gratifying ! " And news-innocent Mr. Dunnigan moved from the hotel lobby to continue his show-card distribution . The placing of cards in the drug store and the next-door Acme Lunch , where business was booming , was also not a task that took persuasion . Or the adding of a card to the clutter of bottles in the window of Hilda Kubisac 's Beauty Parlor with its legend on the plate glass , " Here Dwells Loveliness . " Coaltown even possessed one of these ! The neglected business of " hair-do 's " was likewise whooping along . One notable result of the miracle was a sudden swerve of the feminine population toward personal attractiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to more appreciative environs , Miss Hilda had had a waiting line all day , and was working far into the evening ! So William Dunnigan , these preliminary sorties beneath his belt , entered the Bar and Grill of Mr. Koepke  --  he of the multi-colored juke box and the boisterous laughter and oaths . The press agent had been there before and sampled its doubtful liquor . It was the roughest saloon in Coaltown . It would be a test of his boast to Father Paul that he could place his cards in the saloons . Koepke 's place was cut to the pattern of all the other Coaltown drinking places . The largest perhaps , but at that it was simply a lengthy , narrow room  --  the long bar with its curved , shut-in end taking up one side , and against the other wall a waist-high shuffleboard game that extended some twelve feet like a bowling alley track . Beyond this , at the rear , small tables for card playing and relaxed drinking , likewise for private wrangling and fistbangingdiscussion of mine politics . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's had all the conveniences for a complete social life . Women could enter , but were seldom there except on " pay night , " when the place became a gala scene of mixed-company festivity and bickering . This being an ordinary day ( except for the miracle ) , there were no ladies present , but due to the town 's awakening , more miners than usual and several newsmen were having refreshment for body and mind . There were some two dozen patrons in the room . Bill Dunnigan avoided the newsmen talking at the far end of the bar and stepped between two groups of miners . Heavy-faced , drink-serving Mr. Koepke ( he attended his own bar ) greeted him cordially , as be considered Dunnigan a welcome although a " single shot " customer . Since his arrival in Coaltown Bill had not gone in for any heavy drinking . " I 've got a special bottle for you , Mr. Dunnigan , " said Koepke , " did n't know I still had it ! Pre-war Vat 6s . It will cost you sixty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference ! " " Thanks , " said Bill , " I 'm a little tired and could do with a . ) good drink ! And I 've got a big favor to ask of you . " ! " The house is yours , Mr. Dunnigan ! " said Koepke . He had a feeling that the presence of this well-dressed stranger gave a lacking " class " to his emporium . Proudly he produced from a bottle-filled shelf the special one he had been saving since morning for this monied customer . He deftly loosened the cork and placed both bottle and a glass upon the bar . This in itself was an unusual mark of confidence . Most drinks in Coaltown were very carefully measured , and poured only by the seller thereof , the bottle being immediately replaced beyond the reach of the customer . " Seltzer and ice ? " he asked . " Or do you prefer it straight ? " " If it 's the real thing I 'll take it straight , " said Bill , " and , Mr. Koepke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind your bar . " It was at this precise moment that Bill Dunnigan became conscious of the presence of a burly figure of a man at his immediate right . He became conscious of it because the left arm of that figure jostled Lim as it reached out across the bar and took . a firm grimP379on the Vat 61 that had been placed there for the press agent 's particular consumption . " Pre-war stuff , eh ? " growled a husky voice addressed to this bottle , now held up for closer inspection in a ponderous , minestainedfist . " Been holding out on us , have you ? " this to Mr. Koepke . " I 'll have a shot of it myself , if His Highness the city gent do n't object ! " The words " His Highness " and " city gent " had no friendly intonation . They were in fact exceedingly insolent , as was the manner and leer of the person who spoke them . Dunnigan 's entrance had not passed unnoticed . There had been a pause in laughter and oaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smartly-dressed , derby-topped figure had appeared . Next to the events occurring at St. Michael 's Church , his own presence in the town as the " millionaire " friend of Stan Trocki 's kid had been the chief topic of speculation and conversation . But as he had already been seen in several of the saloons during the past two days  --  he was no " damned prohibitionist "  --  had bought his drink ( never more than one ) , drunk it quickly and departed in silence  --  local habitants had given him the courtesy of at least a pretended indifference that even the roughest of barrooms will extend to a patron who minds his own affairs . They would have been equally generous in friendly or unfriendly conversation , if the stranger had wanted it . Such is the understanding code of bars the world over , a code too little copied in nobler assemblages . Bill turned slowly to regard this unexpected and uninvited sharer of his bottle . The man was really huge , a head taller than the six-foot theater agent . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth-shaven brutishly-intelligent face ; his clothes were those of a miner and a reddish-colored shirt open at the neck revealed a hairy upper chest . He did not wear a miner 's cap , however , but a weather-stained slouch hat . He had been drinking , obviously . Before Dunnigan could speak , owner Koepke interfered . " Now , Jan , " he said , " that is this gentleman 's liquor . I 've gotplenty of your favorite brand the same as I 've been serving you . " " I think I 'll change my brand to a kind that 's set out and lefton the bar , " said the giant pointedly . " I 've always wondered whatthese millionaires like to gargle best . Nothing wrong with seeking some information , is there ? " he added aggressively . " Or is n't my money as good as his ? " Bill Dunnigan was in a placid mood . The ex-bouncer of an East Side dance hall , the frequenter of saloons in every state in the Union had met up with the occasional quarrelsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Koepke . Give our friend a glass . I 'm happy ' to have him sample my liquor , even if he seems to have forgotten his manners . And I 'll pay for both drinks . " " I pay for my own liquor , and if you do n't like my manners , you know what you can do about it ! " replied the man called Jan . T look in his eyes changed from insolence to truculence . He glo ered at the peaceful Mr. Dunnigan . The press agent chose to ignore this remark and its accompanyi scowl . He had more important business on hand than an argumen with a flushed miner over a bottle of liquor . He motioned t hesitating but obviously relieved proprietor to set out anoth glass , and turned his back on this disagreeable bar neighbor who seemed bent on an evening of trouble . He produced one of t two dozen show-cards he carried beneath his arm . " I want you to put up a card over your bar where all yo customers will see it  --  an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " said Mr. Koepke , now especially anxious to accommodate , " I used to put up a show-card each week for a picture theaterin Nanticoke . And I had a pass for me and the missus on m night off . What theater is it for , Mr. Dunnigan ? " Bill Dunnigan smiled . " It 's not exactly for a theater , " he sai . " It 's more important stuff than any show . And I ca n't pay y ' in passes for putting it up . It 's just that you 'll be helping t grand guys that want to help your town  --  that have helped yo and your town a lot the past few days . " " What guys are them ? " asked Mr. Koepke dubiously . M Dunnigan was obviously not speaking of himself . And ten yea in Coaltown had convinced the bar owner that no native of th settlement  --  much less two of them  --  was addicted to altruismeither a civic or a personal nature . " Father Paul of the Church of St. Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Dunnigan . " Here , read it yourself ! " And presented the " 5:45 Mass " show-card to the shirt-sleeved dispension - of liquor . P381Mr . Koepke 's narrow eyes opened wide . He had no need to take his glasses from the top of the cash register to read Bill Dunnigan 's bold , two-inch-high type . It was a striking , two-color job  --  the " DO N'T FORGET , " the " at 5:45 A.M. , " the " MINERS ' MASS AT ST . MICHAEL 'S " in a flaming red ; the other words in brilliant black . " You 'll be doing it for Father Paul , " repeated Bill . " He and his Saint Michael are the lads I 'm speaking of . " Saloon proprietor Koepke was not without religious sentiment . He was n't , to be sure , in the habit of attending Mass at 5:45 A.M. or any other hour , but his " missus " went each Sunday , and an eight-year-old daughter had lately been confirmed at St. Adalbert 's . He had always considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly care for the presence of women in his saloon , and there was a vague , undefined thought that his saloon was not a place for religion either , or for a card advertising a Mass . He wanted , however , to please a gentleman as important and as genial as this Mr. Dunnigan . " I do n't know , " he said . " I have nothing against Father Paul or his church , but I do n't think a card here will help much ! My customers do n't exactly have their minds on religion . " The explosivelanguage at the shuffleboard game behind Dunnigan lent emphasis to this remark . Bill Dunnigan spoke up , however . " Of course not ! There 's a time for religion and a time for other considerations . But since you and Father Paul are both in the same business " " The same business ! " gasped Mr. Koepke . " Certainly ! You 're providing good cheer , are n't you ?  --  a little happiness  --  escape from troubles  --  stimulation when one feels blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the body  --  he does it for the soul ! " Mr. Koepke 's brow wrinkled in a process of thought . Then he smiled . " I never looked at it that way ! " he admitted and was flattered by the idea . Another wrinkling of the brow and he said , " Perhaps you 're right ! " " Of course , I 'm right ! " countered a determined Bill Dunnigan . " Take  --  take your juke box ! " That instrument of the Muses had suddenly started to execute an aggressive rendition of the " Beer Barrel Polka . " " The late Olga Treskovna told me how she remem- tiered that juke box as a little girl . She only saw it from the street , but its music , its bright lights impressed her  --  she remembered them as a sort of magic ! " " Did this great actress say that ! " There was a broad , pleased expression on the hard , fleshy face . Mr. Koepke was impressed . " She sure did ! " cried Bill Dunnigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put up Father Paul 's card . It wo n't do you any harm . It may help him . Your place , I 'm told , is the most popular in town with the mine workers . " Mr. Koepke was only human . And he was up against one of the best salesmen in America . " I 'll put it up ! " he decided . " I do n't know what the boys will say , but I 'll put it up . I 'm doing it for you , Mr. Dunnigan , and for this dead girl . She liked my juke box ! Good music is a fine thing for old and young , is n't it ? " " Thanks a million ! " said Bill , and lifted the bottle to pour his drink . There had been curiosity , ever since Dunnigan 's entrance , abo the large cardboard placards he was carrying . The customers could now satisfy that curiosity . The card advertising a 5:45 A.m . Ma at the Church of St. Michael was placed in a position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there was a concert craning of some two dozen unwashed necks . Those at the table half rose to get a better look . The players of shuffleboard paus in the intricacies of their game . One newsman , leaning on t juke box , took out a notebook and started to copy the readi matter on the card . But the audible reaction came from the man Jan who had now taken a second liberal helping from the Dunnigan bottle an had thrown a five-dollar bill on the bar to pay for the same . " By damn ! " he said loudly . " By damn ! It 's reached a hell of pass , Koepke , when a man ca n't buy a drink without a damn priest name stuck in his face ! Be hearing a sermon next , I reckon , wire a guy wants his shot of liquor . A hymn and a prayer with eve beer ! Take that damn poster down ! I say , to hell with it ! " The card players at the tables were by now on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of lifting their glasse The shuffleboard addicts tore their eyes from the polished surface of their chute . All conversation in the room came to a dead anp383ominous silence . Even the juke box seemed to sense tragedy and ended as abruptly as it had started . Those nearest Dunnigan moved back hurriedly . The anger and commands of this creature Jan were evidently not to be lightly regarded by those who knew him . Proprietor Koepke made the first positive movement . He reached beneath his bar and took a firm grip on a solid police club that he always kept there for " emergencies . " Jan Rubel was the ugliest fighter in the Valley . A dangerous character when aroused and crossed . He had once killed a man with his fists in a saloon brawl and had got off on a plea of selfdefence . Mr. Koepke had no desire to have the annihilation of as notable a person as millionaire William Dunnigan take place in his saloon . It might lose him his license ! But like a higher placed exponent of corrective power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go home , Jan , " he said . At the same time he pushed back the bill on his bar . " Take your money . The drinks are on the house . Mr. Dunnigan is my friend and I 'll do him a favor if I wish . " Simultaneously the saloon owner tried to convey to Mr. Dunniganby look and gesture that he should step back , that danger threatened him . But William Dunnigan did not step back . At that moment the placing of Father Paul 's and St. Michael 's Mass card above Mr. Koepke 's cash register was the most important act of his career . I-le eyed the mountainous figure beside him with a quizzical gaze . " I 'll settle this , " he said to Mr. Koepke . " You 'll settle what ! " said Jan Rubel , and took off his coat and tossed it on the bar . Mr. Dunnigan well knew the meaning of the shedding of a coat . It had happened before in provincial places he had visited , though he himself usually had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought back nostalgic memories of East Houston street . He lifted his glass and swallowed his drink . The liquor was rod . He placed the empty glass on the bar . " Good whiskey ! " he complimented Mr. Koepke . " Thanks for digging it up . " He then turned to the belligerent Jan . " My friend , " he said calmly , " you seem to be upset and undulyp384excited . It 's bad for the blood pressure . I do n't know you , never saw you before tonight ; I shared my liquor with you ; you ( an have nothing against me . But you evidently have it in for priests . Why , may I ask ? What harm has Father Paul of St. Michael 's done to you ? " Dunnigan 's calmness infuriated Jan Rubel but at the same time he was momentarily nonplused by it . You could n't strike a man who did not even raise his voice , much less his hands . Was this millionaire so spineless he could only parry insult with compliance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as insultingly as possible and repeat his demand . Then boot the softie out of the saloon . " I do n't know the bastard and do n't want to know him ! " he sneered . " Let him keep out of my way , that 's all ! " and he gesticulatedtoward the Mass card . " I want no part of him or his fake religious muck ! I say , take down that card ! " " But why ? " persisted a still cool Mr. Dunnigan . And for the first time in his life he framed the question that he never dreamed he , Bill Dunnigan , would ask . " Do n't you believe in God ? " he queried . He wanted to get to the bottom of why any worker in the town should so hate Father Paul . Inadvertently he hit on the core of this man 's social r bellion . " God  --  hell ! " shouted the Coaltown unbeliever . " God damned ! " " You are then  --  an atheist  --  I think that is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a renewed interest . " Why ? " he repeated . Here was something more than just a barroom gangster out for debauch . Bill Dunnigan had never met an avowed atheist . Jan Rubel was now itching to throttle this cool city dandy who stood leaning against his own favorite bar , viewing him , Jan Rubel with a critical , half-smiling stare . A mere booting would be letting him off too easily . But there was time for that after he had scare the interloper with a few well-chosen words and expressed h utter contempt for one of the bulwarks of dandyism , who besid the arrogance of clean fingernails and polished shoes , thought a who worked with their hands devoid of mental capacity . SoonP385or later these gentry fell back on a mention of " God "  --  " Divine Providence " they usually called it  --  to justify their superiority . Rubel 's views on the subject of religion were well known to all natives of the town . The stranger Dunnigan had surely put his foot into a hornets ' nest . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a firmer grip on his club beneath the bar , braced himelf fora quick leap over it , and again spoke placatingly in an attempt to X71 avert a shambles . " Now , Jan ! " he commenced . But Dunnigan again took command . " Let the gentleman speak out and get it off his chest , " he said . " It 's a free country . I 'm interested . It 's a new breed to me ... Well ? " And he turned again to his antagonist . The word " breed " had not escaped Jan Rubel . Very well ! A demonstration of mental superiority , and then ! " I 'll tell you if you really want to know , " he said , and included a spellbound audience in his discourse . " I suppose , soft as you are , you have some brains ! Only you do n't think people like me have them too ! Who invented God ? God ! " And Rubel 's voice became a sneer . " People like you who wanted to live off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live easy , who wanted other men to work for them . I 've read . I 'm not a dumb cluck like most of them around here . It goes way back . How could men be kept down ! How could a few grab everything in sight ? Fear ! That was the racket  --  fear ! So they set up a bogey God , set up a fake terror called religion , invented a Heaven and a Hell --  -- you 'll go to Hell if you do n't knuckle under '  --  and along came priests  --  they were the worst rats of the lot  --  they saw that the poor Wipes would pay money to keep out of this Hell  --  easy money  --  a living without doing any work or dirtying your hands  --  and in a ot of countries they seized on a faker named Jesus Christ  --  born illegitimate  --  their own Bible says he was  --  the old guy Joseph married the mother to save her reputation There was a stirring in the deathly silent Bar and Grill of Mr. . Koepke . Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not churchgoing men , they constantly violated all preceptsof their faith , they blasphemed God hourly , but they wereP271it was inarticulate , he felt it billowing up and rising around him , crying , " The Mass is real ! Faith is real ! God is real ! " And when , after reading Psalm 42 , " Why art thou cast down , 0 my soul ? and why art thou disquieted within me ? Hope thou in God , who is the health and strength of thy countenance , " he came to that part of the litany where the people could respond , then , indeed , he knew one could not lightly decide to say , " There is no miracle ! Go back and be as you were ! " For the responses came with an intensity no church in Coaltown had ever known before : " Lord , have mercy on us ! Lord , have mercy on us ! Lamb of God , who takest away the sins of the world , grant us peace ! " And at the very end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercession of the immaculate Virgin , and then that of Saint Michael  --  " Holy Michael , Archangel , defend us in the day of battle ; be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil ; do thou , 0 Prince of the Heavenly Host , cast into hell Satan and all his wicked spirits who wandered about the world seeking the destruction of souls , " the " Prince of the Heavenly Host , defend us ! " that came back to him was so vividly intense , he also felt that the fighting Warrior himself might have descended from Heaven and could even be at hand  --  there  --  in his very church ! Music had heightened the beauty of the service , had helped to stir the sensibilities of the worshipers . The blind organist was at her post and played as she had never played before . Dunnigan had not understood any of the words repeated . They were chanted in Polish . But one need not know exact words to understand the deep passion of that audience . And he felt a humble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater miracle  --  a flaming pride that his Olga Treskovna had brought it all about . " Gee , kid ! " he said , and he was unconsciously speaking to the girl , " maybe you 've done something bigger even than The Garden of the Soul ' ! " She was there by him before he finished the words , watching the closing of the service from the door into the sanctuary . Perhaps she had stood there since its beginning . She Iooked as she had appearedthe afternoon before out on the church steps . The light from an altar candle was caught and reflected in her hair . It seemed to Bill it made a little halo about that hair.  | " I 'm afraid , Bill ! " she whispered . " I 'm not the cause of any miracles ! I 'm just Olga Trocki ! I just wanted to bring a little happiness , a little joy . Not all this ! This frightens me ! " " Hush ! Hush ! " said Dunnigan . " Just let me handle it , kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when you 're shooting at a star , you shoot high , kid ! " " I 'm glad I 've got you , Bill , " she said . " 1 do n't know what I 'd do without you ! " " You 've got Father Paul  --  you 've got Saint Michael  --  you 've got Marcus Harris , " said Bill Dunnigan . " One for all and all for one . Ycu 'll not fail us , kid , anymore than we 'd fall down on you . " " All right , Bill . Just as you say . I leave it all to you . I 'm going up to the cemetery . There 's some goldenrod along the fence . ( Dunnigan thought , Again sloe 's doing something she loved to do . ) I think I 'll put some on pop 's grave . Pop liked goldenrod , only he did n't call it God 's prayer . ' That was just my idea in the poem I wrote . Pop called it ' Devil 's laughter . ' Pop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw all this because of me . " " He 'd be proud , too  --  down in his heart , " said Dunnigan . " That 's the Agnus Dei the organist is playing now . It means the Mass is nearly over . I know the name of that music because pops can play it , too , on his accordion . Pop plays it beautifully . I 'll ' he up at the cemetery if you need me  --  over by the fence where the goldenrod grows . I want pop to have the first goldenrod ! Good-by  --  good-by ! " Bill Dunnigan wanted to follow her out of the doorway , but Father Paul had moved to the front of his altar rail and was directingwords toward the coffin of Olga Treskovna . Was he speaking on the subject of the miracle ? Was he denying that there was a miracle ? Was he explaining the turning of the statues ? The Polish words brought no meaning to the ears of the press agent , but the worshipers had all knelt , and that atmosphere that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathering was one of quiet and acquiescence . Dunnigan breathed more freely. ! Whatever he was saying , Father Paul was making no denial . The priest was simply intoning a prayer for the repose of the soul , an old and beautiful prayer that he had once translated from the Latin into Polish.
