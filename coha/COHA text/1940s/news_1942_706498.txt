txt CAIRO , Egypt , June ** one of the most primitive parts of this planet ? the Libyan Desert ? the most modern machines of war are locked in deadly battle . Fourteenton General Stuarts , seventeen-ton Valentines , twenty-ton Crusaders and twenty-eight-ton General Grants and General Lees are moving amid clouds of powdery desert dust . Now they move left , now right ; then veer back again and plunge ahead . They fire with their seventy-fives , they fire from swinging turrets with their smaller thirtysevens . The shells scream off across the desert sand to answer those screaming overhead or bursting to right or left . " Got one that time ! " an observer calls down to the tense gunners . " She 's on fire ! " he adds jubilantly . " Good shooting there , sergeant ! " Other shots whine away from other Allied tanks and strike home . An Axis tank halts suddenly , the survivors of the crew scramble out and run away from the derelict with a gaping hole in its front armor . Another shell strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a. dune . The machine careens crazily and falls over on its side . Thus , monsters born of men 's ingenuity today replace the horse , the spear and the saber and , to a large extent , the rifle . So powerful is the modern tank that it nearly always becomes the decisive factor . The infantry still play an important part , but without tank support they can not survive or do their own job . Tanks Bear the Brunt The effect , then , is that a tiny fraction of the whole army  --  the tankmen  --  actually bears the brunt of those struggles that bring a decision . The remainder of the ground force in reality is a support group . It may aid in actual battle , hold ground after a battle or bring up supplies , but the tanks hold the key to every situation . This is certainly true on the Libyan front today . Much of the mine field that formed part of the British fixed defense line is now destroyed . The battle is being fought in open country with only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gazala areas , remaining amid the vast sandy sea in which the land navies of the Axis and the Allies are manoeuvring . To the winner of the tank battle will not go only the open country but these fixed positions as well . There are no tactical positions of much value in the open desert . When enemies meet they meet on equal terms  --  unless there is the element of surprise or unless one side has the greater force . The attacker has a cumulative advantage . Because he has the initiative he may surprise his opponent and by rapidly moving an equal force he may manage to have a preponderance of strength at a given place and at a given time . The outcome of the present battle will probably turn upon fattors making it possible for one side or the other to keep on attacking . These factors are chiefly numbers and machines  --  and above all , supplies . In these the British now have the ' advantage and if this is used to make offensive war on Marshal Rommel and his corps positions the Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Objectives Studied Yet no prudent man may ignore the possibility that a commander like Marshal Rommel , whatever the odds , will try to attack again . If he does , where will he head for ? The Nazi marshal has never made any bones about where he aimed eventually to go . He cited Tobruk as his objective in his order of the day . But there is much to indicate that he did not have then and does not have now any intention of making an immediate assault on the Tobruk defenses . His first intention far more logically would have been to isolate British infantry forward positions , such as El Gazala and Tobruk , from the rest of the rear area . It is still likely that Marshal Rommel means to punch northward to the sea to cut off El Gazala and subsequently to try to storm it . If he succeeded in this and if the British withdrew from Bir Hacheim he would have a new line well anchored at both ends and much nearer Tobruk . An attack on Tobruk itself would come but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ? Browne in The Manchester Daily Dispatch A British gag .
