The Jap and The MacArthur glared at each other across the swamps and swirling hills of Bataan Peninsula . All the rounds so far had gone to the Jap . But he had not landed a knockout blow . He sat down to wait and think . That was a mistake . <P> Smart as they come , General Douglas MacArthur used his outnumbered Americans and Filipino troops where-without airplanes and reinforcements-they could do the most damage . The 14-mile battle line across the peninsula curled suddenly : as viciously as the peninsula 's king cobras , MacArthur 's men struck down surprised outposts . In 48 hours the enemy had been thrown back from two-thirds of a mile to as much as five miles , on the right flank north of Pilar . <P> It was plain that MacArthur had gambled on disrupting Japanese plans for an all-out offensive . He might even have captured maps and orders detailing the attack plan . He was missing no tricks . He even struck behind the Jap lines at civilian morale by authorizing expenditure through a Civilian Emergency Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Jap onslaught . <P> After that the battlefront settled down . Communiques late in the week told of sporadic raids , light action . The reports were only another version of the slogan of the 31st Infantry ( see below ) . The slogan : <P> " We 're battling bastards from Bataan , no Mama , no Papa , no Uncle Sam . "
