When Ambassador William Dawson , U.S. representative to the Pan American Union , said last week that the U.S. wanted Nicaragua at the Bogota conference , Washington 's latinos guessed that the U.S. was at last ready to recognize Dictator Somoza 's government . They were wrong . Later , to shut off the guessing , white-haired Ambassador Dawson telephoned 17 embassies ( but not the Costa Rican , Honduran or Dominican , whose governments recognized Somoza last year ) and made it clear that inviting a neighbor to a neighborhood powwow did not mean approval of the way the neighbor acted . <P> Meanwhile Colombia , the conference host , had popped off and granted Somoza recognition . Most Latin American republics would probably soon follow Colombia 's lead . If such a bandwagon started rolling , the U.S. might have to climb aboard , no matter whether it liked all the passengers , or not .
