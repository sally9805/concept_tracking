For Sir Archibald Clark Kerr , Britain 's special envoy to Indonesia , time dragged as sluggishly as a sick carabao . While he waited for Indonesians and Dutch to get together , the Ambassador visited Surabaya , where tall , mustachioed Major General Eric Mansergh , Commander of the Fifth Indian Division , invited him to give British troops a lecture about Russia . <P> The lecture hall was Surabaya 's Rex Cinema , hot , humid and jampacked with soldiers . Britain 's former Ambassador to Russia and next Ambassador to the U.S. stepped up to the speaker 's stand . First he tried to pour himself a drink , but the cap on the bottle stuck . Next he asked for a reading lamp . It was brought , minus a shade . Sir Archibald borrowed a beret from an officer in the first row and placed it jauntily over the light . Then he began : <P> " I want to take you on a little tour . . . . " But only a squeak came from the microphone . Sir Archibald shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throats yelled : " No ! " <P> An officer hurriedly adjusted a wire . Again Sir Archibald shouted : " Can you hear me ? " Half a thousand throats yelled : " No ! " The other half-thousand cried : " Yes . " General Mansergh stepped into the breach , bellowed : " I want one man to answer and only one . Third man from the left in the last row in the balcony-can you hear the Ambassador ? " A lonely voice piped : " No . " Again someone fiddled with the wires . For the third time Sir Archibald cleared his throat : <P> " I want to take you on a little tour . . . . " At this point he was drowned out by the rush and thud of a sudden tropical rainstorm . Java 's torrid heat made closing the doors unthinkable . Then nearby British artillery opened fire , presumably against Indonesian guerrillas . Sir Archibald , seasoned diplomat though he was , gave up , with a shrug of his shoulders . " I ca n't compete with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realizing that the thunderous obbligato was being played by his own guns , bellowed : " The Ambassador ca n't compete with the Almighty-rain and thunder ! " <P> As the special envoy hurried away , the speaker 's lamp started burning a hole through the lampshade beret .
