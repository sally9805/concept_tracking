This week Bernard Baruch gave the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the U.S. the benefit of an old man 's experience and advice . As usual , it was so commonsensible it sounded daring . The nub of it ( with familiar Baruch bells on ) : the time has come to quit horsing around and get to work . <P> Inferentially , Baruch was for ERP , but that was not enough . Peace , he said , can not be legislated , or even bought with appropriations . But economic stability " can be brought into existence inside of two years , through an all-out production drive here and in the rest of the world . " The Baruch program : 1 ) stabilize the world , 2 ) stabilize the U.S. <P> To achieve the first he recommended , among other things , that the U.S. : <P> Stand ready , for the next five years , to buy all the world 's nonperishable materials which can not find normal commercial markets anywhere else . Such a promise would galvanize European production , he argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . <P> Urge the countries of Europe to form an economic union ; promise them flatly to go to war to protect them from an aggressor . <P> To achieve the second objective he recommended that the U.S. : <P> Reduce farm prices and guarantee fanners that those prices would not drop for three years . <P> " Stabilize " wages ; control rents . <P> Clamp back 50% of the wartime excess-profits tax ; postpone tax reductions another two years . <P> Did Baruch really believe that farm prices could be rolled back , and wages " stabilized " ? He was not talking about what was politically expedient or even politically practical , but what he thought ought to be done . " We must stop inflation not to save Europe but to save America , " he said . He offered this yardstick to measure any anti-inflation plan : " Let the public ask-whom does it hit ? If it hits everyone , more than likely it will be a good program . If it taps here and there , touching one segment while exempting others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By inclination , " he said , " I am opposed to government controls , except in wartime . However , we have no peace today . . . . You can not save free enterprise if you let the system which protects it go to ruin . . . . The time has come to organize-to mobilize-for peace .
