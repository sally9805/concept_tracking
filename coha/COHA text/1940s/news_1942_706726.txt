txt Henry J. Kaiser , the California ship builder who wants to build colossal cargo planes to carry war supplies to the far corners of the earth , is back in Washington with blueprints and specifications , but somewhere along the line he has lost much of the fire that characterized his first visit here . ' line military services are rather well agreed the cargo planes already being built will do the freight-carrying job more practically than Mr. Kaiser 's mammoth plane . Donald M. Nelson , WPB Chairman , is listening to everything Mr. Kaiser has to say , and has promised to follow his proposals to " a logical conclusion . " At least four models of cargo planes are already being turned out at airplane factories in various parts of the country . Whether it is because of the advertising Mr. Kaiser has given the cargo plane or not , it is a fact that much more emphasis is being given this type of plane by the armed services since the Nazi submarine campaign has made transportation of supplies by surface ships difficult . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability . The stumbling blocks officials believe he will run into concern chiefly materials , engineering " know-how " and labor . Mr. Kaiser still insists he can be turning out 200-ton cargo planes , bigger than any flying thing the world has ever seen , within 18 months . The aviation industry which has performed some " miracles " itself in the past sticks to the belief that it takes three and one-half to four years to turn out a new model big airplane . Aviation company officials argue that it is more sensible to build ships about one-fourth the size of Mr. Kaiser 's proposed plane because then if one is shot down the loss would not be so great . Mr. Kaiser explained here yesterday that a big ship is required to carry the gasoline load necessary for a round trip to the far outposts to which the planes would travel . While refusing to describe details of his plane as they will he presented to Mr. Nelson , Mr. Kaiser revealed that the fuselage would probably be made mostly of plywood-plastic . Subcontracting , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his original plans contemplated . A move by the War Manpower Commission partially to freeze labor on the West Coast by recluiring " certificates of separation " from workers leaving lumber and metals industries did not bother Mr. Kaiser , he said . Many of the " quits " in these industries heretofore have been lured to his and other West Coast shipyards by higher wages . Explaining that he began building ships with 3,000 men and now has 123,000 , he declared : " Ninety per cent of them had never seen a shipyard before in their lives . I 'll do the same with the plane-building program . " Though noticeably more subdued than during his first visits here a month ago , Mr. Kaiser still draws a good press when he comes to Washington . Newsmen sat all over the furniture and the floor of his Shoreham Hotel suite yesterday to hear him say that he would " remain here until a decision is reached one way or the other " on his planes .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
