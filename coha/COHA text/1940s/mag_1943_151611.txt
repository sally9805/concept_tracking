Whether U.S. comic strips are a menace to children is an old and vexing question to conscientious parents . This week came a partial answer . <P> George E. Hill , professor of Education , Morningside College , Sioux City , Iowa , diligently studied the language of 16 different daily newspaper comics ( 384 strips altogether ) for a month . He did not study comic magazines , nor did he concern himself with the activities of comic-strip characters . He was interested solely in finding out how comics might influence a child 's vocabulary . He found that : <P> &gt; 9,302 different words were used in the strips studied . Nearly 80% of them simple primary-school words . Only slightly more than 5% were slang , misspelled or onomatopoeic words ( in comic magazines the proportion is some 10% to 12% ) . <P> &gt; 130 different slang words were used . Examples : babe , bracelets , chee , crack pot , darn , dawgoned , diggity , flatfoot , framed , gal , gents , gorsh , heck , haywire , holy-mackerel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O.K. , phooie , scram , shux , tipoff . <P> &gt; Onomatopoeic words ( manufactured to imitate sounds ) occurred 233 times . The most frequent ones : heh , haw , hey . <P> &gt; Comic-strip artists use word distortions for definite purposes - for humor , to indicate common slurrings , to convey the sound of a dialect . Examples ( from Smilin ' Jack and Popeye ) : a-gettin ' , ah 'm , aihport , fergit , yam ( for am ) , ast , certingly , goner ( for going to ) . <P> &gt; Burlesque-type comics like Mickey Mouse contain more word distortions than other types ( adventure , etc . ) . Of the 16 strips examined , the one with the most word distortions was Joe Palooka . <P> Conclusions . Wrote Professor Hill : " Much is being written about the ' menace ' of the comics . Unfortunately a distinction is not always drawn between comic magazines and the comics of the daily papers . In my opinion , most of the latter are quite harmless . ... I doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm to a child 's vocabulary attainments . Most of the words used would , in fact , tend to help him build vocabulary meanings . . . . We need to be much more concerned about the total effect of the comics on the attitudes and ethical concepts of children . . . . Comics are a part of the folk literature of our day . . . . Their ethical significance is almost immeasurable. "
