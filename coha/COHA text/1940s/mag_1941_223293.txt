If the editor of the Christian Science Monitor retired to denounce Mary Baker Glover Eddy and all her works , the U.S. would be no more surprised than England was last week when the editor emeritus of the Empire 's No. 1 religious weekly told what he really thinks of the church in Britain . <P> For 17 years Sidney Dark quietly edited the Church Times . He was known as an Anglo-Catholic and a mild socialist , but no one expected him to celebrate his resignation this year with a jeremiad like The Church , Impotent or Triumphant ? " Now , " said he , " I can say exactly what I believe with no polite reservations . " <P> So Editor Dark denounced his own established Church of England for living off taxes paid largely by non-members and off income from slum property ( " money extracted from the half-fed for . . . bug-infested attics is paid to men whose business it is to preach the Gospel " ) . The Anglicans , he says , have strong support only from the middle class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . are now for the most part almost empty . The fashionable churches are emptier . " Only 18% of the population attend any church regularly ( U.S. estimate : 23% ) . <P> Roman Catholics fare no better in Editor Dark 's book . He assails the Vatican for temporizing with Hitler and for ditching Catholicism 's Popular Party in Italy to come to terms with Mussolini in the Lateran Treaty . " With its Right definitely Fascist and its Left timorously sentimental , " says he , " the Christian reformer can expect nothing of any constructive value from the Roman Catholic communion in England . " <P> Nonconformists are handled equally harshly as " the Sunday edition of the Liberal Party " - and , like the Liberals , Nonconformity " has lost both its spiritual fervour and its political influence . . . . The young people of the class to which Bunyan belonged , the class which produced the Wesleyan local preachers and the Salvation Army today have no understanding of the possible dignity and beauty of life which Bible-reading teaches , and no appreciation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British churchmen is that " Protestantism and Catholicism have both urged the patient acceptance of injustice in the sure and certain hope that things will be put right one of these days " - i.e. , kept the poor in line by promising them future bliss . This , he finds , plays right into the dictators ' hands , since they promise the poor something much more immediate . <P> The church must stop being " woolly and wordy , " grab " the last chance that it can have for generations to affect the course of history . . . . Christianity is a revolutionary religion or it is nothing . . . . The Church must enthuse the young as Bolshevism has enthused them in Russia and Naziism ... in Germany . " One reason he considers Christian leadership particularly necessary in Britain : political power has passed largely into the hands of " unimaginative " trade-union heads who " have little interest in anything but hours and wages . " <P> Specific reforms he favors :             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
