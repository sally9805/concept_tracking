Music-lovers of Prague still liked Bach , Beethoven and Wagner , but they pined for a change of fare : for six years under the Nazis they had heard almost nothing else . <P> Last week the Czechs set out to discover what kind of noises Allied music had been producing behind the din of war . To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra , the citizens of Prague opened a four-week Government-financed International Music Festival . Main courses in the feast : jarry American spice and the lean tonal dishes of modernists in Russia , France and England . <P> To make room for the music , the Czech Parliament moved out of its marble-columned Rudolfinum building . To represent the U.S. in two programs , the Czechs invited Manhattan 's brash , brilliant 27-year-old Composer-Conductor Leonard Bernstein . For a week Bernstein , who speaks no Czech , waved an impatient baton at musicians rehearsing unfamiliar rhythms . At week 's end sold-out houses heard a reasonable facsimile of more modern music than most U.S. concertgoers hear in a season . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every kavarna ( coffee house ) in Prague , applauded compositions by Aaron Copland , William Schuman and Samuel Barber , but gave the loudest ovation to George Gershwin 's Rhapsody in Blue , with President Truman 's protg-pianist , Eugene List , as soloist ( TIME , April 22 ) . Bernstein led the orchestra through a rousing performance of his own apocalyptic Jeremiah Symphony . After concerts , Bernstein played the piano for Czech Philharmonic 's conductor Rafael Kubelik and his violinist wife , updating them on the latest versions of Honky-Tonk Train and Empty Bed Blues .
