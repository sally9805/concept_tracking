The biggest news of last week-perhaps the biggest news of the year or of all World War II-took place inside the White House . But that news was destined to stay in there for some time . What problems Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt had to resolve , what plans they had to make , were known facts ( see p. 19 ) . But other things were secret . <P> After the Prime Minister and the President had been glimpsed by photographers driving from the railroad station to the White House , there was no one at hand to report : <P> &gt;How late Churchill and Roosevelt sat up chortling at each other 's tales . <P> &gt;Whose anecdotal eloquence came out on top . <P> &gt;How many cigar ashes cascaded down Winnie 's waistcoat and whiskey &; sodas down his throat . <P> &gt;Least of all , what specific decisions they finally agreed on about their problems and their plans . <P> These last were proper military secrets . Americans would have to guess at them for a time . So would the Axis .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
