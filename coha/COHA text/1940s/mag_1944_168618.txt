To the Parliamentary Reconstruction Committee last week Deputy Finance Minister Dr. W. C. Clark voiced one of Canada 's prime postwar worries . Said he : " Unless Canada can convert British sterling to U.S. dollars , Canada 's postwar lot will be hard indeed . " <P> Finance Expert Clark was arguing for a firm postwar international agreement on currency . But he was also driving home the point that Canada , more than most countries , must trade to live . In a war boom that has swelled Canada 's exports to more than five billion dollars , the hard facts of Canada 's prewar trade were forgotten . Then Canada was the best U.S. customer . But she financed her essential U.S. purchases , serviced her American debt by her trade with Britain . Sterling balances in London were converted to U.S. dollars . <P> World War II made this arrangement impossible , forced President Roosevelt and Prime Minister King to devise the Hyde Park agreement . Under it the U.S. pledged itself to purchase sufficient Canadian raw materials , place enough U.S. contracts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This scheme has worked so favorably that Canada is now able to repay the U.S. in her own dollars for U.S.-built extensions to the Northwest airway to Alaska ( TIME , March 13 ) . <P> This is the result of war business only . Clearly Canadians would like to carry over the same arrangement to postwar trade .
