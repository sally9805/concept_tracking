In 1917 chaplains got less attention from the Army than cooks . Few cantonments had chapels , and chaplains got neither religious equipment nor other assistance . Officers could assign the chaplains to all sorts of chores-tending the canteen , courts-martial , postmaster , athletic or entertainment director , checking up on mess purchases . Many colonels made virtual errand boys of their chaplains . <P> Today all this is changed-partly because many church groups protested World War I indignities , partly because few ministers would volunteer if it meant the 1917 kind of odd jobs . In this war chaplains can concentrate on spiritual work , and , instead of holding services in mess halls and " Y " huts , they will have a $21,220 chapel for every post ( 22 in the biggest camps ) , each seating 400 soldiers , equipped with altar , electric organ , slant roof , steeple . The altars are being built on tracks , so they can be slid back when the chapels are used for other purposes . Ground for the first of these new chapels was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their chores , chaplains besides writing sermons and holding services will have as their principal jobs trying to make friends with the men of their regiments , trying to lead them in wholesome amusements , visiting them when they are sick , helping to get them out of jail , writing to their families on unpleasant occasions , and , if it comes to that , they will also have the privilege ( but not the obligation ) of going into battle with them and ministering to them while they die. * <P> The chaplain 's official training manual five times tells them they must have a sense of humor . " If you do n't have a sense of humor when you get in the Army , " said a chaplain in Texas last week , " the boys give it to you . " <P> Changed also from 1918 is the status of religious and welfare organizations . Then they worked in the camps themselves . Now the Army 's Morale Division , aided by the chaplains , will manage matters inside the posts .

Next month U.S.O. will start a drive for $10,765,000 to pay for running these buildings . A soldier 's uniform will be his ticket to the clubhouses , and soldiers are to have a say in their running . <P> Typical U.S.O. clubhouse will be far swanker than the barren " Y " and K. of C. huts of World War I. It will have lounge rooms , free newspapers and magazines , pianos , radios , photographic darkrooms ( one out of every two draftees has some kind of camera ) , facilities for dances , forums , hobby clubs , amateur dramatics .
