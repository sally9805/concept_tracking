And of all that Thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto Thee . <P> - Genesis 28:22 <P> To the Kerr canning-jar people , Jacob 's tithing vow is more than a wall motto . It is a way of doing business : every time Kerr makes a dollar , God gets a dime. * <P> The Kerr headquarters in Los Angeles show the marks of the partnership . The walls of the president 's big office are covered with religious paintings . A well-thumbed Bible is always on the desk . Behind it last week Mrs. Ruth Kerr , 55 , a widow with 13 grandchildren , started her 25th year as head of Alexander H. Kerr &; Co. and its subsidiary , Kerr Glass Mfg . Co. ( which sells the home-canning jars the parent company makes ) . <P> Ruth Kerr is a blue-eyed , plump , soft-spoken woman who believes that the Lord will provide , but that a body ought to help Him all she can . She has increased the company 's output elevenfold , partly by branching out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her plants in sensible shoes , and shuttles between factories by plane . Last year her company turned out more than 100 million jars , not far behind Muncie 's Ball Brothers Co. , the biggest U.S. canning-jar maker . Last week , in a nip &; tuck battle with Ball for the No. 1 spot , Mrs. Kerr launched her biggest advertising campaign yet . <P> The Partnership . Ruth Kerr is a Baptist . " Anything I 've done , " she says earnestly , " was accomplished because of what God has done . " God has been a partner in the company since 1902 , when debt-ridden Alexander Kerr , an obscure wholesale grocery man , took the tithing vow at Portland , Ore . Three months later , Kerr took a chance : he borrowed money to buy a patent on a glass vacuum jar that could be sealed at home . Kerr got a San Francisco glass works to supply his materials , and in four years had a profitable business . <P> In the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 , he was first informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the factory was " miraculously saved . " After that , the Kerrs never doubted that God was on their side . When the two-piece lid ( invented in their kitchen in 1915 ) boosted their business , Kerr gratefully took to putting tithing leaflets in every case of jars . <P> The Matriarchy . When Kerr died in 1925 , Mrs. Kerr stepped into her husband 's job . She set up research laboratories , and showed a genuine flair for promotion . She offered university scholarships as prizes in canning contests , sent out salesmen in a fleet of 40 Fords with giant Kerr jars jutting from the rumble seats . <P> To keep her employees happy , she set up group insurance , retirement and medical plans , awarded gold badges and bonuses for good work . Since many of her 600 employees are women , she promoted women into executive jobs . Such benevolent maternalism allowed her to run an open shop for years . When the union arrived in 1946 , it was a conservative union of which Mrs. Kerr could approve . The A.F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a major strike in 58 years . <P> Mrs. Kerr still has time for prayer meetings and choir practice , In her way of life , religion and business are inextricably mixed . Whenever a Kerr glass furnace is relit after a shutdown , a minister is called in to ask a blessing .
