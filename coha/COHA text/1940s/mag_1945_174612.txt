Big Three rule of thumb : when Russian negotiators sit hour after hour , staring glumly at their navels , things are going badly . When they look their opponents in the eye , and smile , things are going well . <P> Foreign Commissar Viacheslav Molotov waved a grey fedora and smiled when he stepped from a U.S. Army plane at Washington 's airport this week . Greeted by Edward R. Stettinius Jr. , Mr. Molotov kept on smiling and stared at a point midway between the Secretary of State 's chin and navel . Posing later with Stettinius , Anthony Eden , Sir Archibald Clark Kerr and Ambassadors Harriman and Gromyko , the Foreign Commissar stared at nothing in particular ( see cut . Mr. Molotov 's companions regarded this as encouraging . <P> So long as he kept his eyes up , there was hope of settling the Polish dispute which had brought him to Washington . <P> The Hammer &; Sickle flag was flying on Lee Mansion , just across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House , when Molotov paused for a brief rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stettinius took him over to meet President Truman for the first time . As always , Molotov had to speak through an interpreter . When Stettinius and Molotov emerged , they were not smiling . From the President down , Mr. Molotov 's U.S. hosts were prepared to look their guest in the eye , be tougher with him than they had ever been before . So were the British . It was , they had discovered , the best way to make Mr. Molotov look them in the eye . <P> Lesson in Semantics . The rough course of the Polish negotiations had been a lesson in Big Three relations . It all went back to the Crimea Declaration 's wording of the agreement reached at Yalta by President Roosevelt . Churchill and Stalin : <P> " The Provisional Government now functioning in Poland should ... be reorganized on a broader democratic basis with the inclusion of democratic leaders from Poland itself and from Poles abroad . . . . Mr. Molotov , Mr. Harriman and Sir Archibald Clark Kerr are authorized as a Commission to consult in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with other Polish democratic leaders from within Poland and from abroad , with a view to the reorganization of the present Government . . . . " <P> The trouble had never been that the Russians considered this agreement a scrap of paper ; they clung to it with a deadly , literal seriousness . Three major differences arose : <P> 1 ) The Russians said the agreement meant that conversations should be held with the Warsaw Poles first , later with the other Poles . The British and Americans said that all parties should be present at the first meetings in Moscow . <P> 2 ) The Russians said that the Warsaw Government should merely be enlarged to include some other parties and men . The British and Americans said it meant a completely new Government . 3 ) The Russians interpreted " democratic " to mean their kind of " democracy , " which they take very seriously and think suited to them and their cherished security in Eastern Europe . As War &; the Working Class said last week : " It would be a completely hopeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be built exactly on the lines of the British or American example . " Hopeless or not , Clark Kerr and Harriman insisted on democracy without Communist quotation marks . And that was the nub .
