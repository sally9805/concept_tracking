Liberals , Unite and Act ! Sufficient PRESSURE can force any army to retreat . If it holds its ranks and maintains its morale the retreat may be no more than a stage in a strategy of further advance . But if its ranks break and it becomes demoralized , then it faces destruction . In every battle a time comes when a retreating army must counter-attack or face annihilation . That is its time of testing . In the battle for power which rages ceaselessly in our democracy , liberalism has been under heavy pressure for the last two years ; pressure from within government and in the armed services , and pressure from Congress and the press . The role of liberals in retreat became hard . Often retreat was necessary . But never did retreat solve anything for the New Deal . Leon Henderson felt himself compelled to lead the OPA in retreat before reaction . Now the OPA is in grave danger . Dean Landis decided that retreat was the best role for the OCD ; he filled his staff with conservatives and avoided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather . In the organization of manpower , the War Manpower Commission retreated with great momentum . But as fast as it fell back , Selective Service , and the manpower division of General Somervell 's Services of Supply moved forward , maintaining the pressure . Early in December the Commission reached its last line of defense , beyond which lay possible army control of manpower . On that line it had to stand or face destruction . Donald Nelson rose to authority with the War Prodection Board because of the terrible consequences of the policy of retreat pursued by Knudsen . But Nelson continued the policy which he was placed in command to combat . Under the same illusion of the limited appetite of reaction which brought Britain so close to disaster , Nelson watched , without doing anything , the rise of a ruthless power-grabber in General Somervell . Nelson had already seen the War Department snatch the direction of the tank and ordnance programs from the OPM , leaving only shipbuilding and aircraft for the WPB . But Nelson left the aircraft program to a bad administrator in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capt . J. 0 . Gawne . He left his production division under a conspicuous exponent of further retreat , W. H. Harrison . So Somervell , in moving forward , took one after another of Nelson 's men and finally , when there was only Harrison left in charge of production , decided to make a clean job of it , and took Harrison too . When it was reorganized in June , there was n't even a production division in the War Production Board . But Soznervell 's digestion was not up to his appetite . He spent so much of his time in grabbing power and so little in getting more production that aircraftproduction flattened out and the war effort became unbalanced . As the schedules went awry , the strategy of the United Nations was weakened . Yet Somervell , with a divided WPB force in front of him , continued to move forward . Then , with control of aircraft threatened , Nelson brought a fighter to Washington in C. E. Wilson of General Electric . Wilson had no ambition to wrap himself up in gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreat was already far advanced ; early in December the WPB reached its final line of defense , beyond which lay military control over the economy . On that line , it too had to make a stand or face destruction . In the field of world relations , liberalism in government was led into the same retreat . The sluggishness of the State Department in attacking the pressing problems of war and reconstruction led the President , in 1941 , to give the tasks of import and export control and post-war planning to Vice President Wallace 's Board of Economic Warfare . For some months State , angry as it felt , was immobilized by the dickerings with Kurusu , the Rio Conference and the illness of Secretary Hull . But early in 1942 , State returned to the offensive . It moved back into control of exports and in a surreptitious sort of way it created its first , completely unrepresentative post-war-planning committee . When it advanced into BEW territory , the Board had already developed a spirit of retreat . The BEW was engaged in a life-and-death struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ import control . Also , the commandos of reaction in the Dies Committee staged an admirably timed raid against the BEW . Under the continual pressure of investigation by a hostile Congress , Milo Perkins withdrew his main forces from the no-man 's land of post-war planning , and determined instead to make the BEW a center of militant wartime activity which later could be projected into reconstruction . Into the abandoned area the State Department rolled with startling swiftness . In no time it established any number of committees , subcommittees and sub ' committees of the subcommittees , almost none of which had any close relation to the urgent problems of the future . The Treasury advanced an excellent plan for a United Nations Bank and Stabilization Fund , but State managed to hold it up until another plan , under which State kept control , could be developed . In otte case , plans for a **25;910;TOOLONG council , Stater by taking the initiative , built itself into a strong per " tion . The other agencies asserted that the council should not be dominated by America and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not be on a tat kitchen basis ; but they did not really fight back . Graff " wally State brought under its aegis the Lend-Lease Administration , which Hopkins had once seen as the great agency of reconstruction . It compelled the White House to assent to the weakening of the BEW by bringing all of the foreign missions of the BEW under its own embassies and legations . The invasion of North Africa brought this struggle to a climax .. A great deal of the administration of North Africa under the army was logically the responsibility of the BEW , since it had prepared the army 's occupation plans . But the State Department , using the burst of popularity which the invasion bestowed upon it , forced its way in and thrust the BEW aside . The State Department agent in North Africa , Robert Murphy , sanctioned the creation by Admiral Darlan of his own Bureau of Economics under Vice-Admiral Fenard with full control of all economic matters in North Africa , including relations with other countries . The further extension of Darlan 's powers followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispatches in the press . Late in November the State Department , with Jesse Jones and the Lend-Lease Administration in tow , set out to break the BEW . A plan went to the White House by which the BEW was to be cut up into three pieces of which the RFC was to get the biggest part and State some of the remainder . To reinforce the plan , Uncle Jesse persuaded Senator Danaher to introduce a rider to the RFC appropriation bill which gave to it supervision over the funds spent by the BEW . So the BEW reached its final line of defense , where it , also , had to stand or face defeat . One month ago the War Manpower Commission began to fight . The labOr-management committee which McNutt had gathered around him thrust its way forward and prepared a strong executive order placing all manpower under civilian control . The President at first wished to give manpower to the Department of Labor , but Ickes convinced the President that the growing importance of farm labor in the manpower situation made this a mistake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its changed spirit , accepted the executive order which it had prepared . So the line was held . One month ago the WPB began to fight . It stood up to Somervell and returned to the aircraft picture with I real program for scheduling production , taking the fight openly to the President . The President ? and for this Hopkins must be held responsible ? indicated in his remarks about locking both contestants in a room Without food until they could agree , that he had not grasped the importance of the issue involved . But for the first time in two years the unions and the militant ? rtes in Congress joined to force the issue . Again the L'resident respected this new fighting spirit and gave Wilson supervision of scheduling the aircraft program . So this line was also held.783 Today the BEW has begun to fight . This fight is now raging and its outcome is uncertain . But however confused the issue may be , in this struggle liberals have no choice . For some time the State Department has resented liberal criticism . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuinely democratic program in the appointment of Governor Lehman , Paul Appleby , and the labor representatives on its planning committees , the State Department might have succeeded in winning the acquiescence of the liberals . But evidently some officials in the Department felt that the time for appeasing the liberals was over . The time of gestation in the appeasement of reaction in Europe was ended and the time had come for realization of the appeasement policy , involving the acceptance of many unsavory figures . The time had also come to break the BEW . So strong measures were needed . The Department , or some officials in it , chose to crack the whip . At this moment the test of the liberals came . In general , our ranks held , but our line of defense , which is perilously close to our final line , is not yet strong . Now our time of testing has come . Where are our lines to hold ? Behind the fortifications which the Republicans need only to take to capture power in 1944 ? While we wonder whether we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darlan and , the dealings with him . While we are wondering whether we should bottle up our dangerous thoughts about the future , a reactionary with progressive trappings , Governor Stassen , has driven a deep salient into our lines with a program for the continuation of the United Nations in time of peace that is far in advance of any speech by any administration leader . Are we willing to be trapped and destroyed by such a transparent flanking maneuver ? With such a program , Stassen and Dewey may sweep away the last vestiges of our spirit in 1944 , if we fail to make the future our own . In determining our strategy from now on , we must of course face the threat of an administration defeat in 1944 . It is always possible to argue that if we continue to expose the weaknesses in the administration , our people will lose faith in it and will permit its defeat . Yet , by our silence we can not hide these weaknesses . Our one chance is to demand that they be overcome . Woodrow Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense a real issue between his administration and the Republicans . This is also why we may lose . Our task now is not to trust the President to be a liberal but to make it possible for him to be a liberal , by arousing this country behind a militant progressive program on his behalf . In this spirit we must now hold our line . We must now ask , What does the government mean when it speaks of " Otto of Austria ? " We must ask , is North Africa , the first country that we have brought back under the United Nations , a democratic or a semi-fascist state today ? How many political prisoners are still in prison under Darlan ? How many of the two thousand Austrian anti-fascists who were conscripted under the Vichy regime to work on the trans-Saharan railway are still conscripted ? How many anti-Semitic laws are still on the statute books ? How much restitution of Jewish property has actually been undertaken in accordance with the promises of the United Nations ? Secretary Hull states that there is no time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no time for consideration of the moral principles on which democratic politics are constructed ? We must roundly damn this attitude from one end of our continent to the other . We must demand an end to the outrageous policy of appeasement , just as we must demand the application the world over of the principles of the people 's revolution which we have proclaimed . We must demonstrate that through our policy the war can be brought to a swifter and more decisive end . Yet , if a delegation of excited liberals should call on the President today to press him to lead this fight , his reply might well be this : You ask me to fight , to take risks , perhaps to suffer losses ; and what do you offer me ? Faeh time that the administration has joined in your fight , Congress has beaten it to a standstill ? the Congress that you elected . How far have you fulfilled your part of the job , in building up a liberal national legislature and a liberal press , in creating in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radical future of democracy and world government that you believe in ? Come to me when you come as part of a movement , not as an unorganized minority unable to support the spirit which it demands of its leadership . We have no answer yet . We must hold our line . We must demonstrate that we too have just begun to fight . Already the powerful group of European leaders in America , deeply shocked by the retreats of the past month , have formed a common council which may speak for all of the peoples of Europe . We need to form our common council of progressives in America , so that from now on , all of our strength will be behind the blows we strike . The liberals are beginning to do this ; but our line is under heavy attack . Unless we counter attack now , the damnation of liberalism will be that in every time when the hopes of progress were raised high and torn down again , the liberals were always right in theory , but powerless .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
