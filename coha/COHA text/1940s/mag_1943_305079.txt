Next to the late great Nicol Paganini , the most famous violinist of the 19th Century was a fantastic Norwegian named Ole Bull . Ole ( rhymes with Caf au lait ) took scarcely a violin lesson in his life . His brilliant playing was always eccentric in technique and in emotion it was usually the most sumptuous ham . But big , courtly , iron-muscled Ole was the most assertive personality in Norway and one of the most assertive personalities outside it . Last fortnight the first full-length biography of Ole Bull was published by his granddaughter 's husband , Mortimer Smith of Sandy Hook , Conn . ( The Life of Ole Bull ; Princeton University Press for the American-Scandinavian Foundation ; $3 ) . It is a fine , factual account of a large-gestured exhibitionist . <P> The musical world never forgave Ole Bull for his ready attention to the lower musical tastes . One of the most phenomenally gifted fiddlers who ever lived , he ignored the classic repertory with a persistence that drove critics to fury . He liked to offer his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression ' ' as though , " remarked one critic , " he were wrestling with the inward spasms of a Pythian frenzy . " He liked to astound his audiences by performing on all four strings at once , a trick he managed with the aid of a special flat-topped bridge . <P> Ole Bull received 50-odd years of public homage . Statesmen like Henry Clay , authors like William Dean Howells , Mark Twain and Thackeray basked in his companionship . Longfellow and Joaquin Miller wrote poems about him . Women begged for samples of his bath water . Sixteen-year-old Queen Isabella of Spain offered him a generalship in her army . <P> Elegant Form . It was Ole 's life and character which inspired Ibsen with the lurid idea of Peer Gynt . Born in 1810 , brought up by prosperous parents in the little provincial fishing town of Bergen , Ole Bornemann Bull flatly refused to obey his childhood violin teachers . At 23 he was playing quartets in many prominent European salons , carousing and dueling on the side . In Paris he met 14-year-old Flicie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years he married her . Then he spent years trying to convince her that she should live permanently in Norway while he roamed the world . She finally consented and settled down with their four children . Sometimes he did not see her for years at a time . <P> In 1843 Ole Bull arrived in the U.S. Pushed the New York Herald 's critic : " This extraordinary being-this Ole Bull-will produce an excitement throughout he Republic unlike anything that ever took place in our day . He is young-unmarried sic-tall and elegantly formed - as beautiful as the Apollo . . . . " One reporter asked Ole what master he had studied under . Said Ole , with a serene stare : " God , the Infinite ! " At a Washington concert a Congressman from Alabama rose in the midst of one of Ole 's improvisations and shouted : " None of your highfalutin , but give us Hail Columbia , and bear hard on the treble !
