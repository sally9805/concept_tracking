The inauguration last week of Juan Antonio Ros Morales as 22nd President of the Republic of Chile was simple and democratic . Entering the Honor Hall of Parliament as a private citizen , he advanced to the rostrum , took an oath to respect the Constitution , donned the red , white &; blue sash-of-office which retiring Vice President Gernimo Mndez doffed . As " Don Annimo " Mndez walked out , Don Juan Antonio briefly announced his Cabinet and policy . Both reflected the man , as the man mirrored the epoch . <P> The Cabinet was with few exceptions a collection of " illustrious nobodies . " The policy , combining sympathy toward the U.S. with determination to maintain Chile 's remaining neutrality , perfectly exemplified Chile 's dilemma . For the dominant groups in Chile are sharply split on foreign policy . Until their conflicting interests are resolved , they agree that what they need is a firm government of " Center concentration " under a strong-man mediator . It is a case where the policy is the man , and Ros was perfectly cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks the part . Iron-grey , over six feet tall , lean , muscular , cold , with a hawk nose , and down-slanting heavy brows that are a cartoonist 's godsend , he looks , as he is , a personification of stubborn and violent will . Characteristic was his reply , as President-elect , to banqueting businessmen who proposed certain Governmental measures : " Do n't advise me , I prefer to be wrong alone . " <P> Equally characteristic was his behavior during a debate on constitutional law in the Chamber of Deputies , when he crowned his opponent with a copy of the Chilean Constitution , shouting : " This is evidently the only way you can get the Constitution through your head . " <P> No orator , he prefers to read his speeches , which are , like himself , dry and sharp . He is married to a German-Chilean , Marta Ide Perera of the artistic Ide family , has a quiet , formal home life . He disapproved his three sons ' music lessons lest culture should sissify them . For himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chilean cowboy . <P> The Policy . Of less distinguished origin than any President since Balmaceda , Juan Antonio Ros , at 53 , is a tough and dynamic fighter , a stubborn and lonely man , come up the hard way . He stands as supreme arbiter of not yet completed struggles . His specific plans he has so far kept to himself-except for the announcement that he will demand extraordinary financial powers and the right to concentrate public services . But by last week enough evidence was in to indicate something of his policies . <P> On the internal front , Ros has said that his Government would be " a Government of the Left , but a reasonable Left , a Left of Order . " When he further announced " order in the streets and in production " and the replacement of Aguirre 's slogan " To govern is to educate " by his own " To govern is to produce , " Chilean labor prepared for strikes . <P> On the external front , until the conflicting sectors of Chile 's leading groups can come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ros will undertake no change in foreign policy .
