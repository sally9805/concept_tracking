txt DEMOCRATS FACE MANY-SIDED BATTLE ON VICE PRESIDENCY Opponents of Wallace Fail to Agree on Single Man to Bear Brunt of the Contest TRUMAN DRAWS SUPPORT Senator Is Unwilling to Make Race ? C10 Leaders Oppose the Boom for Byrnes By TURNER CATLEDGE Special to Tat Nrso Yoax Tutus . CHICAGO , July ** Vice President Wallace rushing here from Washington to fight personally for his renomination and his opponents trying desperately but thus far unsuccessfully to center on a champion , the Democratic National Convention , scheduled to open at the Chicago Stadium at 11:30 A. M. tomorrow , appeared tonight to face the real possibility of an oldatime Democratic battle royal over the selection of a running mate for President Roosevelt . Seeking to forestall this possibility , an increasing number of antiWallace leaders were making a supreme effort to line their forces behind Senator Harry S. Truman of Missouri . This was taking place at the end of a day which buzzed with rumors and counter-rumors concerning the opposition to James F. Byrnes by the Congress of Industrial Organizations and other groups , and additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of War Mobilization not to permit his name to go before the convention . Mr. Wallace 's opponents considered themselves free to proceed following Mr. Roosevelt 's mild endorsement of his 1940 running mate in a letter which reached the convention city last night and the added remark therein that the choice was up to the convention . Byrnes " Stock " Seems to Slip Mr. Byrnes was regarded until this morning as the focal point of forces intent on preventing the renomination of Mr. Wallace . His stock appeared to slip markedly , however , after word was put about that Philip Murray , president of the CIO , and Sidney Hillman , chairman of the CIO Political Action Committee , opposed him . Mr. Murray and Mr. Hillman denied at an afternoon press confer , ence that they were " against " Mr. Byrnes or anyone else . They said that they were simply " for " Mr. Wallace , for whom they have long been fighting , and would stand with him to the end . Mr. Wallace 's friends , meanwhile , experienced a considerable lift in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disclosure of the President 's letter . One of the possibilities was that Mr. Roosevelt would be asked in the final stages to designate his choice , and that he would again demand Mr. Wallace , as he did in 1940 , or turn to Associate Justice William 0 . Douglas . Favorite Sons in Background Senator Alben W. Barkley of Kentucky and at least a dozen other " hopefuls " stayed in the background as the Vice-Presidential contest was intensified . None of them seemed to be picking up strength , so far as word-of-mouth conversation around the Chicago hotels would indicate . Mr. Barkley was endorsed by the Kentucky delegation in a caucus ; Gov . J. Melville Broughton of North Carolina was put forward by his delegation and several other delegations endorsed favorite sons . Mr. Byrnes was not to be considered entirely out of the picture , although it was generally under- , stood that he would not go to the post without the President 's consent . Reports that Senator Truman was to be the choice of the antiWallace forces were heard in the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earlier in the day , it was stated , Edward J. Flynn , New York national committeeman , in a conference with leaders , informed them that the decision of the Wallace opponents was to back Senator Truman , and that the New York delegation might be voting for him , at least after the first ballot . The group agreed to accede to this decision . The word was passed along and it speedily became an open secret . The Truman boom found ripe territory in New York State , because of the fear of the New York City leaders that the alternative was // Mr. Byrnes , whom they regard as a liability in New York City because of the religious issue arising from his turning from Catholic to Protestant in his youth and the racial issue arising from his Southern origin . Mr. Truman has said that he did not want the Vice Presidential honor , and so informed his Missouri delegation today . The Missourians , however , decided in a rising vote to put-him forward . Senator Truman had been in the Byrnes camp and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was reported to have informed Mr. Hillman of this intention at a breakfast conference this morning , during which the CIO leader was said to have voiced the unrelenting opposition of the CIO Political Action Committee to Mr. Byrnes , but indicated that he , Mr. Truman , would be acceptable in case Mr. Wallace were turned down by the convention . CIO as a Political Force Reactions to the reports of the Hillman-Truman meeting had more than anything else to do with breaking into the plan to nominate Mr. Byrnes and to establishing the CIO as one of the dominant forces at the convention . The program for Mr. Byrnes ' selection was reported to have gone so far that banners had been designed presenting the ticket of " Roosevelt and Byrnes . " The chances for a fight over the second-place nomination came not alone from the fact that the Wallace opponents were having a hard time centering on a candidate . It came also from the new vigor displayed by the Vice President 's supporters . With the progress of State caucuses during the day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight were saying that they had more than 300 delegates for the first ballot . The Pennsylvania delegation voted 44 to 21 for Mr. Wallace on a show of strength proposed by Senator Joseph F. Guffey , the Vice President 's chief backer in the official group . Mr. Guffey predicted later that the Wallace count would go to at least sixty votes on the first ballot . The California contingent voted unanimously on a standing vote to support him , and Nebraska went to side by a division of 17 to 1 . Michigan Group Swayed by UAW On motion of R. J. Thomas , president of the United Automobile Workers , CIO , the Michigan delegation voted to cast its thirty-eight votes for Mr. Wallace . Richard T. Frankensteen , vice president , aviation division , of the UAW , was elected chairman of the delegation . The Montana group at its caucus defeated by 51/2 to 41/2 a motion of Representative Jerry J. O'Connell to vote solidly for Mr. Wallace , but he is expected to get at least five out of the group . By 9 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit rule for Mr. Wallace . Most of the ballots pledged in these caucuses were already pledged or claimed by Mr. Wallace 's leaders . On the other side of the picture New Jersey ? voted thirty-three to one against a ' proposal to support him ; Illinois deferred its caucus , presumably until a suitable anti-Wallace candidate was indicated , and Tennessee voted unanimously to throw its delegates to Governor Prentice Cooper for Vice President . Unanimous Vote Plan Is Fought The gathering promises to be , more than anything else , a Vice Presidential convention . The President 's selection by a lopsided majority has long been assured , although new efforts to have him nominated unanimously died aborning today . Some ardent fourth-term advocates sought to have the President placed in nomination and then to move that the nominations be closed , and thus keep out of the record a scattering of votes against him . Friends of Senator Harry F. Byrd and former Postmaster General James A. Farley indicated that these anti-fourth term Democrats would fight such a procedure , though neither is likely otherwise to allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be confined to the Vice Presidential nomination . Negro groups have indicated that they will fight to the end , even to the convention floor , to have written into the platform the strongest possible anti-discrimination plank in order to have the party disavow officially the antiNegro attitude in the South . Southern delegates can be expected to fight such a move . It is not impossible that some of the latter might even walk out of the convention . Racial Issue Is Dominant The racial issue dominated deliberations of the platform writers again today . They found themselves unable to suggest a compromise acceptable to these two apparently immovable groups . Representative John W. McCormack of Massachusetts . chairman of the resolutions committee , said that he did not expect the committee to complete the racial plank before tomorrow night , if then . The convention will get under way when Robert E. Hannegan , national chairman , calls the delegates to order in the Stadium and Mrs. Dorothy Vredenburgh , secretary , reads the national committee 's call , official authority for the meeting . Chief interest will center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Robert S. Kerr of Oklahoma , the temporary chairman .
