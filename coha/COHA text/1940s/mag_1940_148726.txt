S. families at a price they can afford for the first time in history . " Once a vitamin is isolated or synthesized , researchers almost invariably find in it some long-awaited healing powers . <P> Doctors have already begun to feed powdered grass solution to newborn infants with hemorrhages . Of the 20-odd vitamins known to science , about ten can be extracted from plants or produced artificially . Most important vitamins on the physician 's shelf : <P> &gt; Vitamin A : for night blindness and certain skin diseases . <P> &gt; Vitamin B complex ( consisting of some 15 related vitamins ) : for pellagra , and for deafness caused by deterioration of the auditory nerve . <P> &gt; Vitamin B1 ( thiamin ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inadequate lactation , nerve diseases of alcoholism , facial neuralgia , cirrhosis of the liver , sciatica . <P> &gt; Vitamin B2 ( riboflavin ) : for blindness caused by inflammation of the cornea , certain skin disorders . <P> &gt; Vitamin C ( ascorbic acid ) : for scurvy , pyorrhea , rheumatic fever , wound healing , hemorrhage , cataract , insomnia , inflammation of bone marrow . <P> &gt; Vitamin D ( calciferol ) : for rickets , nervous spasms , softening of the bones , acne , psoriasis . <P> &gt; Vitamin E ( alpha-tocopherol ) : for sterility , muscle weakness , diseases caused by degeneration of nerves . <P> &gt; Vitamin K : for hemorrhage.
