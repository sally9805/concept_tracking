Hitler is merely an ex-guttersnipe , a mediocre little man with a mediocre mind , acting just as any fanatical , substandard person would act . . . . The fool can not even see that he is destroying himself and his people . . . . Hitler is just a dirty gutter fighter . . . . We should set American science to work devising the most hellish instruments of defense the mind can conceive . . . . If a beneficent God , as we believe , cast an archangel into eternal fire , why should we be choosy about what we may have to do to Hitler the Horrible and his horde ? <P> A gaunt , cadaverous , Irish Catholic editorialist , hunched over a typewriter in the office of the Boston Traveler , pounded out these words with satisfaction one morning last fortnight , handed them to a copy boy , sent them on their way to the composing room . Then acid-tongued Joe Toye , 50 years old , with 34 years of news experience behind him , went out to lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1825 , is Bos ton 's biggest afternoon paper ( circulation 210,000 ) , but it is not renowned for its editorial vigor . In the normal course of events , a few stanch followers of the Traveler 's , editorial page would have nod ded their heads over Joe Toye 's diatribe , and that would have been that . But City Editor Horton Edmands , one day last week , found in his mail a letter of protest from the German Consulate in Boston . <P> Said Adolf Hitler 's Boston envoy , over the signature of Kurt Bohme : " This Con sulate has read the editorial . . in which the head of a nation , with whom the United States of America entertains dip lomatic relations , is insulted in such un civilized expressions , that this Consulate in the future must refuse to give your paper any information in whatever matter it may be . " <P> Press Relations . Kurt Bohme is assistant to the Consul in Boston . Head of the Consulate , who presumably dictates its policies , is a six-foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scholz , reputedly a onetime member of Hitler 's personal bodyguard . He was for a while first secretary of the German Embassy in Washington ( in charge of press relations ) , then German Consul in New Orleans , before he went to Boston in 1938 . As Consul in Boston , one of his first acts was to move his office from the dowdy building it then occupied in the business district , take over a handsome brick home on Beacon Hill , where he discreetly entertains Boston 's Brahmin elect . <P> Dr. Scholz uttered a protest once before , when the Traveler , in a syndicated story by Washington Columnist Harlan Miller , hinted that he had tried in vain to crash Washington society . The Traveler apologized . Last week it looked as if Consul Scholz had protested once too often . <P> Editor Edmands took one look at the Consul 's letter . Without more ado , he slapped the letter into bold type , printed it on page i . Managing Editor Harold F. Wheeler dashed off an indignant wire to Washington . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offending editorial . Next day he added : " Hitler ' is insulted in uncivilized expressions . ' So what ? "
