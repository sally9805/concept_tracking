txt The United States drive for preparedness is swiftly and relentlessly going forward . Marching in step with it is the Nation 's determination to quickly aid the hard-pressed Allies . The House Military Committee approved legislation increasing the authorized strength of the regular Army from 280,000 to 400,000 . The measure also would permit the President to call out the National Guard during the recess of Congress for " use or training " within the United States or its possessions . Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg of Michigan , the Republican presidential candidate whose past foreign policy program has been one of isolationism , now declares " we are no longer neutrals but nonbelligerents on the Allied side , " and urges the United States to give the utmost aid to the Allies . The Anglo-French Purchasing Board announces that " the flow of munitions of all kinds shipped from America will be immediately augmented " as a result of recent Federal action releasing surplus Government equipment and material . One hundred heavily-armed attack planes are earmarked by the War Department for possible fighting in France under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Correspondent of 7 he Christmas Science Monitor WASHINGTON , June ** fast and so furious have been developments in the process of America 's breath-taking preparedness drive that few people have been able to get a comprehensive picture ; of the whole in the rush of infinite detail . Viewed in brief retrospect of three weeks , from the date on Thursday , May 16 , when President Roosevelt addressed a joint session of Congress , down to the present , it is probable . that never . in history , has so vast a program been launched in so short a time . I A brief recapitulation indicates that the change enters into every phase of American economic life , and probably marks the close of some sort of an era in American ' history and the start of a new one 1So far the preparedness program is largely a paper one , but the ini-i tial blue-print stage has brought leading business figures patriotically hurrying to Washington , and has set a new stamp on American thinking . Change in Sentiment The situation calls for superlatives . Rarely if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in public sentiment as has followed the display of Nazi military might that smashed first through Holland and Belgium and then crumpled up the French and British Armies on the Channel ports . A century of isolationigt sentiment of one sort was challenged or scrapped overnight  --  this was a new form of isolationism which Congress suddenly discovered , not a self-imposed isolation , but an isolation thrust upon it . In a review of American armament movements that followed , the public discovered extraordinary deficiencies . It was discovered also that America had been one of the chief beneficiaries of the European balance of power system ; and was protected by British fleet an  --  i French standing army without paying the full bill ; with these threatened , America was found by an alarmed public to be in no present condition to make its own protection absolute . What followed has been called " hysteria " in some circles , but whatever the word , it seems to be commonly accepted that the public has been one or two jumps ahead of Congress in its demand for action , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had one Roosevelt call for a billion dollars of additional defense money gone up than he followed it with the call for another billion . Not a day 's headline but has told of the developing domestic program , intermingled with the front page echoes of roaring guns on the EuropQan battlefront . With the ' domestic developments has grown the realization that America 's first line protection is the Allied armies , and that the longer they hold out the better equipped the United States can be to defend its own frontiers . Long Technical Problem It is doubtful even yet , however , if the newspaper-reading public understands the length of time it will take to build the planes , buy the guns and set up the defenses which are popularly demanded . Technical experts here shake their heads over the prospect . While America 's first line of defense , the Navy , is in , many ways able to cope with normal conditions , the United States on land is woefully lacking in tanks , guns , army recruitment , and above all  --  airplanes . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the Germans should obtain the British fleet , and join hands with Japan . For the defense program as whole , it is hard to see , say experts , how it can be got in full shape in less than two years , or possibly a year and a half . On the other hand , a great deal can be done immediately to speed up plane and tank production . Here are some of the highlights of what has gone into the preparedness program today , cut down to their bare details : Actions by President Roosevelt : On May 16 President Roosevelt addressed Congress on national defense and asked appropriations and authorizations totaling $1,182,000,000 . A few days later he sent a message to Congress asking for deficiency appropriations of $15 , - 400,000 to be added . On May 26 he addressed the Nation by radio in the fourteenth " fireside chat " on the subject of national defense . On May 31 , he sent a special message to Congress asking authorization of defense spending to approximate $4,400,000,000 . He also asked Congress for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilots . More Funds Asked Request to Congress for an additional $2,518,000 for expansion of theCoast Guard personnel and $236,000 for the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation to combat " fifth column " activities in the merchant marine . He held a conference with Col. Frank Knox , resulting in plans for organization of camps to train 50,000 civilian pilots . Sent to Congress a reorganization order transferring the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization from the Department of Labor to the Department of Justice . Named an advisory commission in furtherance of the emergency rearmament program with William S. Knudsen in charge of coordinating industry and Edward R. Stettinius in charge of raw materials and supplies . On June 6 he issued an executice order prescribing regulations governing the entry of alien seamen into the United States and regulations pertaining to documents which shall be required of aliens entering the United States . On June 7 he announced the policy of allowing the Allies to receive trade-in airplanes .
