Lost Boundaries ( Film Classics ) , first published as a real-life drama in Reader 's Digest , described the tragic dilemma of a fair-skinned Negro family in a small New England town who for years had " passed " as whites . The father was a prosperous doctor and a pillar of the community , the mother an active worker in civic affairs . The children , unaware of their antecedents , were normal , happy-go-lucky American school kids-until the day their father , whose secret had been exposed by U.S. naval intelligence , told them the truth . From there on , they became in their own minds pariahs in a nightmare world of shrieking suspicions and shrinking fears . <P> For Producer Louis de Rochemont , who unearthed this somber bit of Americana in the neighborhood of his New England home and passed it on to Reader 's Digest , the story was a natural .

But he keeps clandestine contact with his Negro colleagues , names his son ( Richard Hylton ) after a famous Negro doctor . Out of these contacts emerge some fresh insight into Negro viewpoints , and into the intricate network of etiquette and anguish separating those who can " pass " from those who can not . <P> Dramatically , the film loses ground by its episodic , rigidly chronological story treatment , but the loss is more than regained in a powerful climax and several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sensitive interpretation of a decent man caught in an indecent dilemma . Richard Hylton , in his first screen appearance , plays the difficult role of Carter 's son with ease and assurance . Outstanding bit-player is the Rev.

Fondly and sometimes foolishly , the script follows Marilyn ( June Haver ) from the day she joins up , in pigtails and high-button shoes , with her family 's vaudeville act , to a fictitious revival of Sally in the 1930s . In between it sandwiches colorful chunks of a half dozen of Broadway 's best-remembered shows , samplings of their biggest tune hits , reel after reel of dance routines by June Haver and Ray Bolger ( as Jack Donahue ) , and assorted slapstick sequences by Charles Ruggles as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
