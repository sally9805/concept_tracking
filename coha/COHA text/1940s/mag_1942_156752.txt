Now , Voyager ( Warner ) is the Warner Bros. ' solemn contribution to the study of the mother complex . Sympathetically directed by Irving Rapper , sensibly acted by Bette Davis , Paul Henreid and a massive supporting cast , the picture often succeeds ( in the course of two hours ) in looking like the moving and intelligent drama it thinks it is . <P> The film 's neurosis occurs in Beacon Hill Boston . The agonists are : mother-complicated Charlotte Vale ( Bette Davis , looking 20 lb. overweight in flat heels and the inevitable spectacles ) and Mrs. Henry Windle Vale ( Gladys Cooper , whose discreet , sociologically exact portrayal of the mother is the best thing in the film ) . Claude Rains , in a role reminiscent of upper-class New England 's late Psycho-messiah Dr. Austen Fox Riggs , helps Charlotte escape from Boston and mother by taking a cruise . On shipboard Jerry Durrance ( Paul Henreid ) , a voyaging architect , takes the cure a step further by falling in love with Charlotte . By the time she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex all her own . <P> But Charlotte 's architect proves already to be married to a neurotic . So Charlotte finds happiness in foster-mothering his neurotic little daughter Tina ( Janis Wilson ) , seeing Jerry now &; then on platonic flying visits . <P> Claude Rains 's brainside manner may well fill noncinematic neuropaths with a profound sense of insecurity . As Charlotte , Bette Davis is recognizably neurasthenic . Little Janis Wilson deserves special handling after her tender debut as Tina . By using a simple unfamiliar formula the Austrian newcomer , Paul Henreid ( Night Train ) , makes himself one of Hollywood 's likeliest leading men . His formula : When he is in a tough emotional spot he acts like a kind and morally responsible human being . <P> The Forest Rangers ( Paramount ) is the story of two fights , of which the first is a Technicolor natural . Fight No. 1 is waged by the Rangers against fire in U.S. National Forests . Fight No. 2 is the cat-spat which Paulette Goddard and Susan Hayward wage over Fred MacMurray , while Rival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes the landscapes of the U.S. Northwest look as handsome and healthy as skookum apples . It also makes fire look very fiery while the sound of rushing flames suggests the rumpling of tons of cellophane . So long as The Forest Rangers sticks to these simple properties , and to firefighting methods , the picture is gaudy , noisy , unsafe and sane . But all too soon Cinemactress Goddard falls off a horse and flattens Cinemactor MacMurray , who immediately feels ( or so he says ) " like I had swallowed a comet . " While he digests it , which takes a long time , fires are in abeyance .
