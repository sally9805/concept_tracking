Last week while they wereputting in only day-to-day tactical details on the Pacific war map , U.S. commanders were mixing the tints for more broad-stroke strategy . <P> At headquarters on Guam which his forces had just recaptured , Admiral Chester W. Nimitz gave an idea of the method to be used . It will be continuous blows of Nimitz ' mighty Central Pacific forces - two complete teams : the Third Fleet under Admiral Halsey , with the Third Amphibious Group under Rear Admiral Conolly and the III Amphibious Corps under Major General Geiger ; the Fifth Fleet under Admiral Spruance , with the Fifth Amphibious Group under Rear Admiral Hill and the V Amphibious Corps under Major General Schmidt . <P> The commanders of the Fifth units will plan and execute one operation . While it is in progress , Halsey and the Third units will plan another . This they will execute while Spruance &; Co. prepare the next . <P> Doug and Bill . Since Halsey had been in the Honolulu conferences with President Roosevelt and General MacArthur , he was unofficially nominated as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Philippines . The groundwork for this leapfrog move , had already been prepared . Incessant pressure by Lieut . General George C. Kenney 's Far Eastern Air Forces , said MacArthur this week , had apparently forced the enemy to withdraw his air forces westward from the Molucca Islands* to bases beyond Allied bomber range . <P> Said MacArthur : " This , together with the limitation of his shipping , renders his numerous and powerful garrisons there strategically impotent for anything but local action . " <P> The Challenging Twentieth . While the next major moves were in preparation , the Jap was kept rocking on his heels by jabs from air forces working from all points of the compass , and by a heavy B-29 blow against the homeland . <P> Brigadier General La Verne ( " Blondy " ) Saunders launched the Twentieth Bomber Command on the heaviest aerial assault yet staged from Asiatic bases . He threw his full striking power into a 24-hour assault ; he challenged the defensive reserves of the Jap air force with the first daylight raid on the homeland-the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The target was an old favorite , Yawata on Kyushu . Over Yawata 's steel plants , the B-29s wheeled into the heaviest ack-ack barrage the enemy had ever thrown up . <P> Through waves of black , scudding flak , Jap fighters corkscrewed toward the giant bombers . The lead bombers went over so fast and so high that the Japs could hardly get a pass at them . One fighter rammed a bomber it had been following , and both fell to destruction . But most Nip fighters cagily stayed beyond range of the B-29s ' heavy armament until they could pick on a plane damaged by flak . <P> The Enemy 's Best . A hundred fighters had taken the air ; twelve were confirmed destroyed , twelve were probables . The Jap home air force 's most resolute opposition had failed to prevent a single U.S. element reaching its target . By the time the last bomber left , the afternoon sun had been blotted from Yawata 's mills . Smoke was so dense that bomb bursts from the last planes could not be seen . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beacons for bombers making the second strike , around midnight . The attack group was smaller this time .
