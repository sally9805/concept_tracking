Only twice before had Filipinos tasted the excitement of electing a President . Never before had they enjoyed the privilege of making a choice . As he went to the polls in last week 's close , tropic heat , a Filipino might reasonably feel both elated and nervous . <P> The national political temper portended a roisterous day of balloting . On Luzon , cub planes buzzed in the skies , looking for suspicious gatherings . Jeeps loaded with soldiers patrolled the rutted roads . Elderly , cautious President Sergio Osmena remained secluded in Manila 's sprawling white Malacafian Palace . An armed guard surrounded the hideout of the opposing candidate-flamboyant , fiery Manuel Roxas y Acuna . <P> The early hours of election day brought nervous rumors : of masked bands hijacking voting boxes in Santa Rosa ; of ink poured over ballots in Cavite . And there were some bloody facts : Governor Ramon Imperial of Camarines Sur Province was wounded by gunfire ; a 62-year-old Pampanga supporter of Osmena was hauled from a jeep and murdered by machine-gun fire in a rice field . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leftist Hukbalahap , expected violence failed to materialize . Schoolteachers showed unarmed voters how-to mark their secret ballots . <P> Greatest Champion . From the first , the vote swung toward 54-year-old Manuel Roxas* , who had campaigned vigorously while Sergio Osmena stood on his record and kept mum . <P> Filipinos had come to know Manuel Roxas well . He had once been a general with MacArthur , and was liked by the U.S. military . He was a member of Jose Laurel 's puppet government during the Japanese occupation , but resisted all efforts of the Japs to take him to Tokyo . A lawyer , Roman Catholic , and President of the Senate , he is a magnetic , articulate orator , a serious student of economics . He had the support of most Filipino conservatives . <P> After six days , tired , careworn Sergio Osmena conceded defeat . In self-assured tones , Manuel Roxas outlined his program to U.S. newsmen . He said that he would seek an immediate U.S. loan for rehabilitation , promised full cooperation with U.S. policy in the Far East . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our house in order , restore domestic tranquillity . . . . Despite charges that I have fascist tendencies , I am going to be the greatest champion of democracy in politics as well as economics that this country has . " <P> *When the trend pointed to Roxas , the Philippine Press , a Manila tabloid , printed a boldface column recalling that Jose Vera , Osmena 's campaign manager , had threatened suicide if his candidate lost . The paper called on Vera to make good , suggested poison , a hand grenade , or a banzai charge on Roxas headquarters . Weaseled Vera : " I said ' I 'll bet my life Osmena will win ! ' I never said I would commit suicide . . . I won't. "
