txt The people who put suits on the backs of American men are headed for a crossroads this year . With the post-war stampede from 0 . D. 's to civilian attire long past , many men are already beginning to back away from garments bearing high-bracket price tags . And yet the cost of turning out coats and trousers still bounces upward . That 's the suit man 's dilemma . One big New York City retailer tells this story : Its " budget shop " suits ( $50 and under ) still sell well , but sales volume on garments in its better suit department ( over $50 ) now run 30% below a year ago . Another kingpin New York merchant who says " anything below $50 still moves easily , " also admits his $50-plus sales are sagging . Struggle in February Three big retailers spot-checked by The Wall Street Journal in Boston reported waning customer enthusiasm for expensive suits . A spokesman for one of them , specializing in high-priced merchandise , said : " February was the first month in a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's figures . " In Dallas the men 's shop of the swank Neiman Marcus store reports it sold 10% fewer suits in January than in the like month of last year . Other Dallas retailers . including the Jas . K. Wilson Co. , note a stiffening resistance to high prices . And some have found it particularly noticeable " since the commodity price break . " Such reports , however , are not universal . Many retailers say their higher-priced suits still sell briskly . One in San Francisco says his sales of $50-plus suits are " way ahead " of last year and finds his customers prefer garments in the $75 to $85 class . And in Chicago a spokesman for Hickey Freeman clothes declares : " Brand name merchandise is still being alloted to retailers . We are n't taking on any new retailers and probably wo n't the rest of this year . " Moving for a head-on clash with retail-level price resistance Is the increase in snit production costs . Last November clothing factory workers got a wage hike of 121=2 cents an hour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a boost of 15 cents an hour . Boost for Spring , Fall Prices The wage hike of last November will be reflected in the price you pay for your 1948 spring suit , already being offered in retail stores at prices averaging about $5 above last fall 's level . And the wage increase of last month will hit the retail level as a price booster on next fall 's haberdashery . " In recent weeks , " says a New York City suit maker , " I have been charged increases on cloth ranging from 40 cents to $1.20 a yard . Price increases on cloth alone will put the cost of a better-grade suit for next fall about $10 above last fall 's level . " So far most manufacturers report they have n't felt the price resistance which retailers are reporting from the " firing line " where the consumer is met . Wall Street Journal reporters in key manufacturing centers find things humming . In Rochester , N. Y. , where many of the more expensive suits are made , a spokesman for Fashion Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . " An official of Pincus Bros. in Philadelphia echoes : " We are able to move every garment into retail channels just as soon as it comes off our production lines . " And an executive of Leblow Brothers , in Baltimore , sees " no trouble in booking capacity business " on standard lines of clothing . Not Ali Sunshine Despite this hearty chorus of optimism , there are sizeable straws in the wind which suggest that manufacturers are worried about the squeeze of their own soaring costs on the one hand and the public price-balkiness on the other . Some frankly admit their concern . One Philadelphia suit maker says " nearly every retailer " on his customer list is worried about a price break . Another says : " Prices are as high as they can go without hurting our markets . " Symptomatic of manufacturer thinking on prices may be the recent action of Clipper Craft on its spring-and-summer suits . A short while ago the company announced prices on spring garments would be hoisted $5 . But last week , apparently after a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The extra $5 would have brought these suits to $50  --  the price where retailers say many buyers now become wary . The big men 's clothing chains have fought fiercely to stay at or below the $50 level , but without complete success . The pre-war $35 suit ( most popular in those days ) now generally sells at $55 to $60 . One chain whose $26.75 worsted suit was acknowledged a " good buy " in 1939 has seen the price soar to $39.75 on models for this spring . Test Period Just Ahead Both manufacturers and retailers will keep close tab on public buying of spring clothing over the next few weeks . Prices are up $5.50 to $5 at the retail level from last fall . Retailers will determine much of their buying for fall of this year from Mr. America 's response to spring prices . One major retailer says ominously that if his sales do n't pick up sharply his fall buying , which starts in April , will be limited to 40% of his budget . Normally he does 80% of his buying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men do n't want to pay high spring prices they will be even more reluctant to pay fall prices  --  which are expected to be higher than spring levels .
