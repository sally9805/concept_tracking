Consumers were either running out of ready money , or were keeping their pocketbooks zipped for fear they would . To get them back in a buying mood , the Federal Reserve Board last week let another notch out of Regulation W , the wartime belt it had tightened on credit buying . Starting this week , the U.S. consumer can take up to 104 weeks to pay for anything he buys , and put down only 10% of the purchase price on everything but automobiles ( still one-third down ) . Articles costing less than $100 will be exempt from all controls . ( Previous top : $50 . ) <P> FRB Chairman Thomas B. McCabe thought the changes would hardly be " a significant element " in reviving inflationary pressures . And no one but President Truman seemed worried because Regulation W would expire June 30 . He had asked Congress for an extension , but Congress seemed willing to let it die .
