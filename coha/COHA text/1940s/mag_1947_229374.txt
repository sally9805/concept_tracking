Like a vigorous man who seldom bothers with doctors , Chicago suddenly decided that it was time for a periodic checkup . It asked the U.S. Public Health Service to give it a thorough going-over . For a year , a group of Government experts tested the city 's blood , held a stethoscope to its heart , squinted appraisingly at its South Side . Last week , having finished the examination , the doctors were gravely writing it up for the patient in a 2,000-page report . Chicago , they had found , is a none too healthy city . <P> Two-thirds of Chicago 's drinking water supply is nothing but chlorinated ( unfiltered ) water from Lake Michigan , which is also used for sewage disposal . The city law requiring pasteurization of ice cream and frozen desserts , the investigators found , is laxly enforced . Private scavengers still collect about one-third of the city 's refuse and deposit it in four fly-ridden , ratinfested , unregulated dumps . <P> Chicago , said the U.S.P.H.S. , is too hospitable to rats . City laws forbid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But private exterminators work only in and immediately around buildings . That leaves a " no man 's land ' ' in every backyard , which the rats have been quick to discover . <P> More than 100,000 homes in Chicago , said the U.S.P.H.S. , are unfit for human habitation . What 's more startling , there are more than 4,000 privies inside the city limits . <P> There is a desperate shortage of nurses . According to current standards ( one public health nurse per 2,000 population ) , there should be 2,206 nurses in Cook County . There are only 649 . <P> With a winning bedside manner , the doctors also found a few things right about Chicago . In control of venereal diseases and infant mortality , the city ranks with the nation 's best .
