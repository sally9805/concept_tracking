txt WASHINGTON , March 18 ? The Ways and Means Committee tax bill was denounced as " a monstrosity " this afternoon by Representative Martin , the House minority leader , after a conference at which the Republican members organized to support the Carlson bill , which incorporates a modified version of the Riunl pay-as-yougo plan . Secretary Morgenthau said at his press conference that ' " the Administration is behind the committee bill 100 per cent . " The committee 's report will be ready by Saturday , its experts said , and Speaker Rayburn expects four days of debate to start Wednesday . Meanwhile Representative Carlson , Republican , of Kansas , said that he would change his bill to make it conform to the committee bill as to the 20 per cent withholding provision , the $3,500 exemption of service pay from income taxes and the abatement of liability for members of the armed forces who die during the war . Wants Debate on Single Issue " My object , " Mr. Carlson said , " is to confine the debate to the essential question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection system to a current basis . There is no use fogging the issue in the debate . I do not like some of the changes I am making , but I think it is the right thing to do to keep attention on the main issue . " The major difference between the two measures before the House will then be reduced to abatement of a whole year 's tax liability , as in the Carlson bill , or as in the committee bill , to maintain the present year-behind system with a provision for deductions of up to 6 per cent for taxpayers who pay taxes in the year preceding the due date after fully meeting their current obligation . A chance still remained that some Democrats would take a // FINAL LINES DRAWN IN HOUSE TAX TEST // strong stand for the Robertson plan , supported by organized labor , which would abate the normal and first surtax bracket of taxes on 1942 income . But few Democrats were committing themselves this far in advance of the debate . Representative Martin told reporters after the party conference that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House would support the Carlson bill . " Do you think you have enough votes with those of the Democrats to put it across ? " he was asked , " If you 'll tell me how many Democrats will join us , " he replied . The Republicans met behind closed doors , but it was clear that in addition to Representative Gearhart of California . who spoke for the committee 's bill before his colleagues , several others openly oppose the Carlson measure or asked questions indicating that they had serious doubts . Asked if there was any discussion of a compromise between the Carlson bill and the committee bill , I Mr. Martin replied : " I do not see how there could be any compromise between the monstrosity that came out of the committee and the Carlson bill . " " The committee bill was so far I off from what the people wanted that we did n't even discuss it , " he added . When asked if it was true that the Democratic delegation of one Southern State was solidly for the Carlson bill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think many Democrats will vote for this bill because there are at least 40,000,000 people who want it , and that is a pretty good number in anybody 's country . " The conference lasted about two and a half hours , and according to Mr. Martin , " the question was thoroughly debated . " Members were allowed five minutes each . No vote was taken . Representative Knutson of Minnesota , said on leaving the confer ' ence that Mr. Gearhart was the only member who spoke against the Carlson bill . Representative Crawford of Michigan had previously indicated his opposition , but he was not present . " I give you my word , " Mr. Knutlson said . " I never attended such a harmonious conference in my twenty-seven years - in the House : " Mr. Martin saiftliere were only two ways to put taxpayers on a pay-as-you-go basis , and that the people are impatient for action . These two methods , he said , were : " The Carlson way which calls for only one year 's taxes this year , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 's taxes to become current . " After pointing out that many taxpayers are having great difficulty in meeting even their current taxes this year , not to mention doubling up , as the committee would induce ' them to do , Mr. Martin added that the Carlson bill would not only help out the taxpayers in a difficult period , but would bring into the Treasury $3,000,000,000 of revenue which it would not get until next year tinder existing law . The Carlson bill , he said , would " make certain the tax is collected when the ' good money ' is being earned . To collect taxes on large war earnings in a peacetime period would be a difficult task and bring about many defaults of payment . " " The Republicans , " he added , " are , of course , in the minority in Congress . They can and will present what they believe is a conistructive contribution to the solution of our tax difficulties . To be isuccessful they must have some Democratic support , and we hope this can be assured . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Carlson bill , which mainly quoted Randolph Paul , the Treasury 's general counsel , in support ' of the pay-as-yougo type of collections . It also explained a contemplated change in that part of the bill which provides that taxpayers with income of more than $20,000 would pay this year on the income of 1942 or 1943 , whichever is higher . " It is contemplated that a perfecting amendment will be offered to this feature of the bill so as to give proper treatment to those with incomes slightly in excess of $20,000 , " the circular said . " In effect , it will abate so much of the 1942 assessment as is attributable to the first $20,000 of income , and so much of the 1942 assessment as exceeds the amount attributable to the first $20,000 of income . The benefit of this proposed ' notch ' provision would disappear as the income increased above $20,000. "
