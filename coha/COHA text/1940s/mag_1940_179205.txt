To the American Chemical Society convened in Detroit last week , Professor Ernst Berl of Pittsburgh 's Carnegie Institute for Technology made an astonishing announcement . He said he had made , experimentally but successfully , oil , coal , coke and asphalt from grass , leaves , seaweed , sawdust , scrap lumber , corn , cornstalks , cotton . <P> The earth 's supplies of coal and oil were laid in , once for all , during the Carboniferous Age , 200 to 300 million years ago . Using them is like spending capital . But using coal and oil made from plants would be like spending income , since plants grow prodigally and all the time . <P> One difference between wood and oil is that wood is mostly carbohydrates ( com posed of carbon , hydrogen and oxygen ) whereas oil is mostly hydrocarbons ( composed of carbon and hydrogen only ) . Chemically these two great classes of compounds behave very differently . But economically the really important difference between wood and oil is that wood-burning locomotives are obsolete , whereas oil-burning Diesel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converting the carbohydrate vegetable matter into hydrocarbons is the most ticklish part of Dr. Berl 's process , and he did not talk about it too freely . He heats the carbohydrate under pressure with limestone and " similar substances . " Probably one or more catalysts ( chemical activators ) are involved . The time required is only one hour-considerably less than the millions of years that nature needed . The New York Herald Tribune gulped with excitement : " What the Wrights did to distance , he Professor Berl has done to geologic time . One 's imagination gags at the possibilities . " <P> Dr. Berl did not say how much or what fuel would be needed to run his fuel factory ( if coal or oil were used , the amount consumed would certainly have to be less than the amount manufactured ) . He did say that , with natural coal and oil still plentiful and prices low , the cost would be too high to undertake commercially now . But he believes the chemist 's job is to be ready for future shortages . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After thousands of experiments , Dr. Foster Dee Snell , prolific Brooklyn industrial chemist , and Co-Worker Dr. Samuel Sidney Epstein announced production of a successful antiseptic paint-for children 's rooms , breweries and bakeries , hospitals , food factories . They mix their paint with chlorine and iodine . After nine weeks on the wall it still kills typhoid and some other germs in the air , retains some antiseptic strength for six years . It is not so effective as sterilizing indoor air by ultraviolet radiation , but it is cheaper . <P> Sunshine &; Dew . Automobile makers and owners used to think that the worst enemy of a new car 's gleaming coat of lacquer was sunshine . Chemist Ralph J. Wirshing of General Motors investigated this notion , found it false . Experiments in Florida showed that a car 's paint job suffered most from midnight to noon , least from noon to midnight . Wirshing suspected that dew was the enemy , confirmed this by experiments with artificial dew produced in a " dew box . " For some unknown reason rain is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night , even in summer .
