For the first time in two months , President Truman had a full Cabinet . After four days of public hesitation , Massachusetts ' tall , personable ex-Governor Maurice Tobin accepted appointment as Secretary of Labor . <P> Tobin 's hesitation was understandable . In all probability , the job was good for only five months . It had been hawked around to almost every wheelhorse in the Democratic stable . Harry Truman had offered it to John Steelman , to the A.F.L. Teamsters ' old " Uncle Dan " Tobin , to New York 's ex-Senator James Mead . Caught by surprise when Congress decided abruptly to adjourn , Truman told Democratic Chairman Howard McGrath to call Tobin in Boston and to tell him-not consult him , but tell him-that his nomination was going up to the Senate . <P> For both Tobin and Truman , the deal was good politics . In the Democratic gubernatorial primary , Tobin faced probable defeat by ex-State Attorney General Paul A. Dever . Even if he won , in November he would have to face Republican Governor Robert F. Bradford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truman , Tobin meant votes . Tobin was Irish , a Catholic , popular in New England , strongly supported by labor . He is an able campaigner . Truman badly needed Cabinet members who were willing &; able to get out and stump for him this fall . With the Labor Department shorn of most of its functions by Congress , Secretary Tobin will have little else to do . <P> More important than all these considerations , Truman had done Boston 's ex-convict Mayor James M. Curley a favor . Curley had been nursing a grudge ever since Truman let him spend five months in jail before commuting his sentence . Dever was Curley 's man . With Tobin out of the race , Dever was assured of nomination , and Jim Curley , thanks to Harry Truman , was given a free hand in Massachusetts Democratic politics . <P> Last week the President also : &lt;f Blasted and signed what he termed the " socalled Housing Act of 1948 , " passed by the.special session ( see BUSINESS ) . <P> Called the GOP anti-inflation bill a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it anyway . It authorizes controls on installment buying and increased bank reserves . <P> Disagreed with Ohio 's Senator Robert A. Taft 's prediction that " we are reaching a stabilized price level . " Prices , said the President caustically , level off each week but always at a higher level . <P> Received a pledge of 100% support from Harlem 's " unofficial mayor , " Sherman Hibbitt , told him : " If you can carry Harlem , I 'll win . " <P> Decided to launch his campaign on Labor Day with a speech in Detroit under the joint auspices of the A.F.L. and C.I.O. <P> Offered , for the second time , the job of Assistant Secretary of Agriculture to New Jersey 's State Senator Elmer H. Wene , was turned down for the second time .
