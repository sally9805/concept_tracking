 | couple of months ago I did a little job for the American Foundam for the Blind . For three hours read into a recording machine a ugish ( not to say dullish ) preface had written for a new edition of ) lstoy 's War and Peace . After I d finished , I was told that this as merely a curtain raiser , that an tor ( I got the impression that he as somebody who really knew w to read aloud ) was going to end seven weeks putting the en:e novel ? one of the longest ever : itten ? on records , so that thou:lids of handicapped folks could - ten to one of the greatest stories . - er conceived by the human mind . Well , we who are more fortunate eed not for that reason forego the nple but definite pleasure that . mes of reading aloud and listen. ; to things being read aloud . Our andmothers. and grandfathers : iew this pleasure . Now is the time revive it . Now is the time , when ost of our gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the home ( reember the home ? ) is once more , ming into its own , when we 're discovering our families and our : ighbors . Now is the time to reve this cheap , easy , and strangely tisfying practice . Anybody who can read without uttering can read aloud , and any , dy who likes a good story will : joy listening . Why not try it ? ere are a few tips that may be 1pful . First , there is the Solo Performi.ce . You may read aloud to yourIf . At first you 'll feel peculiar , : en a bit bats ; then you 'll settle eht into it . Most of us are in love th the sound of our own voices ) r the greater part of our lives , . yway . Here 's a chance to give . at love affair a chance for full velopment . Then , there 's the Duet . Read to one person ( wife or husband , it might be ) , and then change off and let the husband or wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about right for each person . In this way you can read , the two of you , about two hours before you feel like shutting up the book and yourself . Best of all is Circle Reading . Put aside one evening a week for a great big Family Read . Choose a night when the radio programs are dullest ( and do n't tell me that 's Friday ) , close the doors , have a plate of doughnuts and a pitcher of cold milk ( that 's best ) handy , and go to it . Let the best reader do most of the job ; but let the others have a chance , too , including the children if they 're not too young . I know one group that used to meet every two weeks , assign parts , and read one of Shakespeare 's plays each time . We 're all hams at heart . Why not admit it ? and get some fun out of it ? Men 's , voices are generally easier to listen to than women 's , and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no rule about it . Do n't worry if you make mistakes ? " fluffs " we call them in radio ? do n't try to elocute or do dialect or dialogue perfectly . Do n't try too hard . Just try to feel what you 're reading ( that 's essentially what acting is ) , and it 'll come out okay . What should you read ? What you like and what a reasonable majority of the reading circle likes . But we might narrow it down a bit . Do n't read about the war ? you get Photograph by Pavel 1() plenty of that at other times during the day . Do n't read essays or " educational " material in general . In other words , do n't read anything that requires too much reflection . There 's no time to absorb it . One good kind of reading is oldfashioned novels . Try Pickwick Papers ( my favorite ) or any solid Victorian novel you 've always wanted to get around to and never did . Try stories with some suspense in them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's The Red House Mystery , often goes over big , even with people who never before thought they could enjoy mysteries . If , like Dickens ' Fat Boy , you like to make their flesh creep , experiment with a couple of Poe 's best short stories . Dorothy Sayers has edited several collections of tales of mystery and horror , and there 's enough in them for a year of good reading aloud . Anthologies in general make fine sources of miscellaneous reading , all sorts and sizes . Here are a few recommended ones : The Traveller 's Library and Tellers of Tales , both edited by Somerset Maugham ; The Woollcott Reader , The Second Woollcott Reader , and the inimitable Alec 's own While Rome Burns ; and Reading I 've Liked , edited by your correspondent , which I recommend without a blush , because it was in part compiled for readingaloud purposes and contains plenty of good stuff . Poetry , too . You 'll be surprised how much you 'll like it , even if you think you hate it . Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poetry or Mark Van Doren 's Anthology of World Poetry and swim around in it . Kipling is first-rate for reading aloud ; so are Carl Sandburg , Vachel Lindsay , the Bab Ballads of ( Continued on page Ile ) @#  | W. S. Gilbert ( of Gilbert and Sullivan ) . Humor is tricky . It needs a good reader , preferably one who can read dead-pan . Mark Twain ( there 's a one-volume Mark Twain omnibus ) is tops ; and a good anthology like A Subtreasury of American Humor , edited by Katharine and E. B. White , will simply sprout suggestions . There 's a new edition of Jerome K. Jerome 's Three Men in a Boat ; there are old favorites like Frank Stockton 's novel , Rudder Grange . If you 've liked a movie that 's based on a book , and you want to know what the original is like , go to it . Jan Struther 's Mrs. Miniver is nothing like the film , but it 's just as good . Try Francis Iles ' Before the Fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood ( Robinson Crusoe , Lewis Carroll . Treasure Island , The Wind in the Willows ) will go over big with the children ( it even may cure them of the comics and will bring back your own childhood in a way you never suspected . If you want to see , or rather hear , hove the thing is done in top-notch fashion . listen in a couple of mornings at 9:15 Eastern Wartime to CBS 's " The Radi , Reader . " Mark Van Doren has read a : . of The Scarlet Letter on the air , and this date Margaret Webster is readir : Jane Eyre . Personally , I think these tv ; books are poorish choices ? too slow ? bu : they 're beautifully done . Reading aloud is to ordinary readir.z what walking is to traveling by car . Yc do n't get there so fast , but you see thin s you never noticed before , and you get sense ? a novel , fresh , healthy sense ? : personal achievement . Nowadays were learning how to walk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through boo for a change , instead of rushing throu them in high . If you do try this and encounter problem or want any further suggestio drop me a card in care of Goon HouseKEEPING . I ca n't promise to answer eve letter in full , but I 'll do my best .
