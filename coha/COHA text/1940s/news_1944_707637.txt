STOCKHOLM , Feb. ** Red Army 's capture of Vitebsk , whose evacuation was reported yesterday // 200 PLANES STRIKE AT FINNS ' CAPITAL // by the Berlin radio but not confirmed by the High Command , would probably do more to speed a Russo-Finnish peace or armistice agreement than even the warning recently given by Secretary of State Cordell Hull , in the opinion of local political observers . Loss of Vitebsk , pivot of the Germans ' Baltic front , would mean that the Russians were in a position to push on to Riga , to take the German Narva armies in the rear and obtain mastery of the Gulf of Finland . Thus the Russians could virtually blockade Finland . Faced by this eventuality , the Finns must make up their minds quickly . From a highly placed Finnish Government official the writer today obtained an interesting review of the situation in Finland . This official said : " Two basic facts are evident . The first is that the Finnish Government is making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and earnest . The second is that the Finnish Parliament , by asserting itself once more , has become a factor of decisive importance . " By the nature of his office , Dr. Henrik Ramsay Foreign Minister ) is the prime mover in the peace effort , which he is sincerely anxious to make successful . President Risto Ryti can confidently be assumed to be back of Dr. Ramsay 's effort , as can Defense Minister Karl Rudolf Walden , who in common with Field Marshal Baron Karl Gustav Mannerheim has long been of the opinion that peace should be sought " Finance Minister Vaino A. Tanner is a late but explicit advocate of the ' peace line , and Premier Edwin Linkomies , although back in office only in the last few days after his illness , probably is taking the same line . Agrarian Chief Opposed " On the other hand , certain less important Cabinet members are still unconverted , among them the Agrarian leader , Tyko Reinikka , Assistant Finance Minister . " As for Parliament , the Social Democratic Riksdag group , much the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its Cabinet members to demand that a vigorous effort be made to ascertain the Russian peace terms , while the Swedisn People 's party refrained from passing a similar resolution only the express assurance of Dr. Ramsay , who belongs to that party , that the Government was taking action . Together , these two parties command a small majority in the House and can count also on scattered votes from other parties for support on the peace question . " The most important factor in causing an active peace policy after months of passivity is the successful Russian offensive from Leningrad now threatening to sweep into Estonia . Only extreme diehards still reason in terms of anything but a Russian victory . Secretary Hull 's warning was perfectly timed , creating a sensation throughout the country . " Also fanning Finnich peace activity was a recent editorial in Ny Dag , Stockholm Communist daily , outlining Soviet armistice terms and generally believed to have been written on instruction from Moscow , the more so since the tone of the editorial was in contrast to the fire-eating attitude theretofore adopted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with tips recently quoted by other sources as to Moscow 's views . " The fundamental points in the editorial were that Moscow harbored no designs on Finland 's sovereignty and was not eager to occupy the country . On these two points both the Government and general opinion in Finland are adamant ; for the rest , the Finns are now prepared to make sacrifices for peace . " Assuming that acceptable Russian terms might now be had , there are still serious obstacles , however . First and foremost are the fear and distrust felt by the Finns with regard to Moscow 's real intentions , apart from the unofficial terms suggested through Ny Dag or any other medium not binding on Moscow . " " Another difficulty  --  paradoxical as it may sound  --  lies in the very democracy of Finland and particularly in the renewed insistence on proper parliamentary procedures , " the Finnish official continued . " At the end of the winter war a harsh peace was presented to the Finnish Parliament as a fait accompli . This incorrect procedure was justified because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was possible because of the Parliament 's solid loyalty and confidence for the Government and the absence of complicating factors . None of these conditions now obtains and the Parliament has to be carried along on all the steps toward peace , which tends to slow the procedure , making it more difficult . " The German troops in Finland present another difficulty . There are many signs that keeping Finland in line is regarded as a major interest by Berlin and it can be assumed that both threats and persuasion are being used . These the Finns probably can and will resist , but the fate of the German Army in north Finland neverthe , less presents a problem . The Germans carefully avoided showing the cloven hoof in Finland , for which the ordinary citizen has no reason to regard them as anything but friends or at least as ' correct ' cobelligerents and providers of food and arms . " To the vast majority of Finns it would seem morally unacceptable suddenly to liquidate or help the Russians liquidate the German forces in Finland . Would a political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the mercy of the Red Army , they want to know . If the Finns were allowed by the armistice terms to give the German Army notice to quit the country , the Finns might take the risk . " " Of the two other difficulties the Finns must master , " this correspondent 's informant went on , " one is of their own making , namely fanaticism of many Army officers.1 It would require the complete authority of Marshal.Mannerheim to make these ultrapatriotic officers give up the game without a struggle . " Finally , there is the problem of food and other supplies , and here the Finns east longing glances at Sweden and the United States . " The opposition to the Government 's war policy hitherto has come from a minority in the Socialist party , a majority in the Swedish party and scattered individuals in other parties . The opposition is divided on the question whether at this late stage it should try to replace the present government with men who are less hostile in Russian eyes and more capable of building a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other of the United Nations or let the present Cabinet shoulder responsibility for the failure of its policy and accept harsh terms of defeat " It seems likely that the latter policy will prevail since most of the opposition leaders feel that new men will have more solid ground to build on if the present regime has to take on itself the full humiliation of defeat . In this question Finance Minister Tanner occupies a special position . Many of the opposition feel that he has so badly filled the part of labor leader that it would be advantageous to get rid of him at once . Mr. Tanner , hitherto a rock of the Government 's policy , made a rightabout face in a meeting of the Social Democratic parliamentary group at which the peace resolution was passed . He proposed the resolution himself . " The demand to get rid of him I can therefore no longer be based on disagreement with his present policy but simply on his own undesirability.
