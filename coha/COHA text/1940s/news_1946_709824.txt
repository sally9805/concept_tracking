txt There already has been one report in these columns of the proposed American Authors ' Authority . This is a kind of literary closed-shop holding company which would have powers in the writing field to make James Caesar Petrillo look like a piker . More developments are in the making . There can be no doubt that the American Authors ' Authority ? is emerging into a full-blown project . It has n't yet been made a functioning reality . But it is making headway . It is , at the same time , encountering opposition . The opposition began only when the full implications of this writers ' closed-shop union began to get around . Further . inquiry into the potential workings . of the American Authors ' Authority has not removed the early apprehensions of those who perceived where it was headed . A A. A The Authors ' Authority first was proposed . to the Screen Writers Guild of Hollywood . It now has been approved in principle by both the Screen Writers Guild and the Radio Writers Guild . It is pending before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Authors League . The latter is the parent organization of all the writing unions except the Screen Writers Guild , which is an affiliate of the Authors Guild .. It is particularly to persuade the uncommitted guilds to stop , look , and listen before they put tirmselves behind this underta cing that a group of nationally known writers has lately* been formed : It includes such persons as ' John Erskine , - John Chamberlain , Oswald Garrison Villard , Stanley nigh , Clarence Budington Kelland , Eugene Lyons , IL V. Kaltenborn , and Martha Rountree . Its purpose is to oppose sneCifically the concept of the Authors ' Authority and to combat all similar attempts at monopoly control over literary material . These writers and others , in announcing the formation of the American Writers Association , contended that legitimate grievances of authors were being used to justify a cure-all capable of throttling free expression in book publishing , magazine , - radio , and motion-picture professions . " Many of these grievances are real enough , " the protesting writers declare . " There is every reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . But there is no call for a centralized authority , in effect superseding the guilds , ? with a stranglehold on all literary production and use . The existence of injustice must not be made the excuse for a totalitarian control more unjust than all of them combined . " A A It seems clear that the Authors ' Authority is reaching for a power sufficient to influence , even to dominate , every medium of free expression in the country  --  motion pictures , radio , magazines , and books . Jefferson Memorial It would be brought about this way . The Authority  --  not the individual author ? would control the copyright of all the works of its members . It would refuse to copyright the works of writers who i  --  efused to become members of the " proper guild . " It would not allow the works of its writers to be sold to any medium  --  any publishing firm , magazine , radio , or picture company  --  which did not abide by the Authority 's rules . It would not permit its writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on any material not ' copyrighted or leased by the Authority . This means that if a motion picture company wanted to use nonunion writers ' material , it would be faced with a strike by its union writers . This explanation of how the American Authors ' Authority is capable of functioning is based upon the published statements of James M. Cain , screen writer , who is reported to have conceived the plan and whose postman certainly is rapping menacingly on the door of freedom of expression in the United States . A A A Mr. Cain has avowed to The Christian Science Monitor 's correspondent in Los Angeles that his only concern with the Authors ' Authority is to use it to correct serious economic abuse There is reason to believe Mr. Cain . But there are others influentially associated . with the Authors ' Authority whose purposes reach far beyond Mr. Cain 's worthy objective . It is not surprising to find the Daily Worker and other Communist publications giving this project I its all-out support . Authors are well paid in Russia  --  and Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
