txt The State Public Service Commission yesterday sought the help of the Petroleum Administration for War in shutting down the municipal electric plants in Freeport and Rockville Centre ? I , . I. , as a temporary measure for saving heavy fuel oil . Both communities , according to Milo R. Maltbie , chairman of the commission , can be supplied with electric power by the Long Island Lighting Company , which generates electricity with coal . Following a conference with Herman B. Van Cleve , chief of the fuel oil section of the regional PAW office , Mr. Maltbie said last night that he expected the Federal agency would soon issue a directive to the two municipal plants to convert to coal . Mr. Maltbie said he had conferred some time ago with Mayor Worden E. Winne of Freeport and with Public Utilities Commissioner Henry C. Major of Rockville Centre and with other village officials and had found them favorable to the conversion plan . They have failed to act fast enough , though , he said , declaring that the plants burn 200,000 gallons of fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available connections between the two municipal electric plants and the Long Island Lighting Company 's distribution system . These connections were provided for the purpose of mutual assistance in case of need , he declared , and could be easily put to use during the time required to convert the municipal generating plants to coalburning equipment . As ice cakes bobbed in New York Harbor and the rivers feeding it , leaders in the oil industry admitted yesterday that the slowly inereas- ing supplies of fuel oil that are coming into the East Coast area have " scarcely put a dent " into the critical shortage of heating oil here . In Bronx Magistrate 's Court two landlords ? with coal furnaces ? II were fined $100 each for failure to provide adequate heat for their tenants . Magistrate Samuel Orr also fined another landlord $50 , and a fourth $5 on the same complaints . All four received summonses from Department of Health inspectors , who testified that heat in the build ' ings was below the standards required for good health . " Something has to be done to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Assistant Corporation Counsel Silas Lippman told the court . Magistrate Orr agreed and added that too many landlords were taking advantage of the fuel shortage to save on their heating bills . Fines of $100 each were imposed on Mrs. Sadie Weber of 1915 Morris Avenue , operator of a fortytwo-family.building at 2065 Morris Avenue , and Henry Goelet of 292 Madison Avenue , who operates an apartment building at 2588 Creston Avenue . In both cases tenants crowded the court room and complained that the heat , supplied by coal burners , was insufficient . The $50 fine was levied on Moses Apterman of 875 West 180th Street , who operates a group of buildings at 1997 Hughes Avenue , all heated from a central system . Mrs. Anna Heim , who manages a three-family house , in which she has her home , at 651 Eagle Avenue , was fined $5 after her two tenants complained that she had failed to repair a broken oil burner . Mrs. Heim showed bills to prove that the repairs had since been made . The Department of Health announced yesterday that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that it had investigated 346 and found thirty-six cases of no heat and twenty-five of insufficient heat . In order to eliminate some confusion which existed with respect to the Office 9f Administration 's recent anti-discrimination order for fuel oil sales , the regional OPA yesterday issued an interpretation of the order . The situation had been somewhat complicated by the PAW 's cancellation two days ago of an earlier preferential order . " The former oil distribution method by which some suppliers had been accumulating supplies in order to meet their own allocation system while denying oil to new customers is forbidden by the antidiscrimination amendment to the ration regulations which went into effect Jan. 9 , " said E. S. Ferguson , regional rationing executive . " The amendment , about which there has apparently been some misunderstanding , has a simple provision under which there is now no reason under OPA rules why a dealer or supplier with , oil should not deliver against coupons .
