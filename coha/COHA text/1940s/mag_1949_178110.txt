For the fifth time in 41 years , Oklahoma 's wets did their doggondest to repeal the state prohibition law . Everyone would be far better off , they argued , if whisky were sold legally-and taxed-instead of just sloshing around the state as contraband , making cops greedy and bootleggers rich . This appeal to sweet reason was dramatized by the fact that the repeal group 's leader , Tulsa Attorney Albert G. Kulp ( rhymes with gulp ) , was a bone-dry teetotaler himself . <P> Nevertheless , the voters went right on liking prohibition anyhow . The state 's church-going United Drys ( many of whom fasted and prayed for victory at the polls ) were fiercely proud of living in a prohibition state. * So , naturally , were the bootleggers . And many an Oklahoma drinker liked prohibition too-there was plenty of good liquor , prices were reasonable , and instead of going out to buy a bottle he could have one delivered promptly to his door . Last week , by a margin of 55,400 votes , Oklahomans of all persuasions decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . <P> <P> *The only other : Mississippi .
