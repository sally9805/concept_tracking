In Toronto last week canny Finance Minister James Lorimer Ilsley did what he has seldom done-went out on a limb . He told Canadians there would be jobs for all after the war in Europe ends . <P> Minister Ilsley had a good reason for reassuring 1,300,000 workers now employed , directly or indirectly , in war industry . Starting Oct. 23 , he must borrow another $1,300,000,000 from Canadians in the Dominion 's seventh war loan . Because 60 to 70% of Canadian war production is for the British account , many war workers have been expecting cutbacks . Minister Ilsley did not want them to hoard their cash . He counted on the Pacific war needs , plus reviving civilian industry , to make his job prediction come true . But he added a cautious qualification : " In many cases men &; women will have to look for new jobs , but they will be there . . . . " <P> As a starter the Dominion 's Labor Department has begun to recruit 60,000 loggers . High wages in munitions factories have stripped of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mining . <P> Last week Canadians got an authoritative estimate of what full employment means.The Wartime Information Board reported that 5,000,000 Canadians were now employed , including 750,000 in the armed forces . It estimated that full employment after the war would mean 4,700,000 jobs , including 200,000 in the services . This amounted to a million more jobs than existed in the peak prewar year , 1929.
