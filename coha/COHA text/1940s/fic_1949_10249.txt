" In an envelope , " the grandmother said tightly . " In a brown envelope with Harriet 's poetry ' written on the front . " " Here it is , " Howard said .

The grandmother sighed at Mrs. Kator and took up the first sheet of paper . Mrs. Kator leaned forward eagerly and Howard settled down at her feet , hugging his knees and putting his face against his leg to keep from laughing .

Although young Mrs. Winning had been a Talbot , and had dark hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Winning , a member of the oldest family in town and her hair was beginning to grey where her motherin-law'shair had greyed first , at the temples ; they both had thin sharp-featured faces and eloquent hands , and sometimes when they were washing dishes or shelling peas or polishing silverware together , their hands , moving so quickly and similarly , communicated more easily and sympathetically than their minds ever could . Young Mrs. Winning thought sometimes , when she sat at the breakfast table next to her motherin-law , with her baby girl in the high-chair close by , that they must resemble some stylized block print for a New England wallpaper ; mother , daughter , and granddaughter , with perhapsPlymouth Rock or Concord Bridge in the background . On this , as on other cold mornings , they lingered over their coffee , unwilling to leave the big kitchen with the coal stove and the pleasant atmosphere of food and cleanliness , and they sat together silently sometimes until the baby had long finished her breakfast and was playing quietly in the special baby corner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same heavy wooden box.  | " It seems as though spring would never come , " young Mrs. Winning said . " I get so tired of the cold . " " Got to be cold some of the time , " her mother-in-law said . She began to move suddenly and quickly , stacking plates , indicatingthat the time for sitting was over and the time for working had begun . Young Mrs. Winning , rising immediately to help , thought for the thousandth time that her mother-inlawwould never relinquish the position of authority in her own house until she was too old to move before anyone else . " And I wish someone would move into the old cottage , " young Mrs. Winning added . She stopped halfway to the pantrywith the table napkins and said longingly , " If only someonewould move in before spring . " Young Mrs. Winning had wanted , long ago , to buy the cottage herself , for her husband to make with his own hands into a home where they could live with their children , but now , accustomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the hill where her husband 's family had lived for generations , she had only a great kindness left toward the little cottage , and a wistful anxiety to see some happy young people living there . When she heard it was sold , as all the old houses were being sold in these days when no one could seem to find a newer place to live , she had allowed herself to watch daily for a sign that someone new was coming ; every morning she glanced down from the back porch to see if there was smoke coming out of the cottage chimney , and every day going down the hill on her way to the store she hesitated past the cottage , watching carefully for the least movement within . The cottage had been sold in January and now , nearly two months later , even though it seemed prettier and less worn with the snow gently covering the overgrown garden and icicles in front of the blank windows , it was stillp105forlorn and empty , despised since the day long ago when Mrs. Winning had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winning deposited the napkins in the pantry and turned to tear the leaf off the kitchen calendar before selecting a dish towel and joining her mother-in-law at the sink . " March already , " she said despondently . " They did tell me down at the store yesterday , " her motherin-lawsaid , " that they were going to start painting the cottagethis week . " " Then that must mean someone 's coming ! " " Ca n't take more than a couple of weeks to paint inside that little house , " old Mrs. Winning said . It was almost April , however , before the new people moved in . The snow had almost melted and was running down the street in icy , half-solid rivers . The ground was slushy and miserable to walk on , the skies grey and dull . In another month the first amazing green would start in the trees and on the ground , but for the better part of April there would be cold rain and perhaps more snow . The cottage had been painted inside , and new paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repaired and new glass put into the broken windows . In spite of the grey sky and the patches of dirty snow the cottagelooked neater and firmer , and the painters were coming back to do the outside when the weather cleared . Mrs. Winning , standing at the foot of the cottage walk , tried to picture the cottage as it stood now , against the picture of the cottage she had made years ago , when she had hoped to live there herself . She had wanted roses by the porch ; that could be done , and the neat colorful garden she had planned . She would have painted the outside white , and that too might still be done . Since the cottage had been sold she had not gone in- side , but she remembered the little rooms , with the windows over the garden that could be so bright with gay curtains and window boxes , the small kitchen she would have painted yellow , the two bedrooms upstairs with slanting ceilings under the eaves . Mrs. Winning looked at the cottage for a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went slowly on down to the store . The first news she had of the new people came , at last , from the grocer a few days later . As he was tieing the string around the three pounds of hamburger the large Winning family would consume in one meal , he asked cheerfully , " Seen your new neighbors yet ? " " Have they moved in ? " Mrs. Winning asked . " The people in the cottage ? " " Lady in here this morning , " the grocer said . " Lady and a little boy , seem like nice people . They say her husband 's dead . Nice-looking lady . " Mrs. Winning had been born in the town and the grocer 's father had given her jawbreakers and licorice in the grocery store while the present grocer was still in high school . For a while , when she was twelve and the grocer 's son was twenty , Mrs. Winning had hoped secretly that he would want to marry her . He was fleshy now , and middle-aged , and although he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she belongednow to the Winning family and had to speak critically to him , no matter how unwillingly , if the meat were tough or the butter price too high . She knew that when he spoke of the new neighbor as a " lady " he meant something different than if he had spoken of her as a " woman " or a " person . " Mrs. Winning knew that he spoke of the two Mrs. Winnings to his other customers as " ladies . " She hesitated and then asked , " Have they really moved in to stay ? "  | " She 'll have to stay for a while , " the grocer said drily . " Bought a week 's worth of groceries . " Going back up the hill with her package Mrs. Winning watched all the way to detect some sign of the new people in the cottage . When she reached the cottage walk she slowed down and tried to watch not too obviously . There was no smoke coming from the chimney , and no sign of furniture near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still moving in , but there was a middle-aged car parked in the street before the cottage and Mrs. Winning thought she could see figures moving past the windows . On a sudden irresistible impulseshe turned and went up the walk to the front porch , and then , after debating for a moment , on up the steps to the door . She knocked , holding her bag of groceries in one arm , and then the door opened and she looked down on a little boy , about the same age , she thought happily , as her own son . " Hello , " Mrs. Winning said . " Hello , " the boy said . He regarded her soberly . " Is your mother here ? " Mrs. Winning asked . " I came to see if I could help her move in . " " We 're all moved in , " the boy said . He was about to close the door , but a woman 's voice said from somewhere in the house , " Davey ? Are you talking to someone ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The woman came up behind him and opened the door a little wider . " Yes ? " she said . Mrs. Winning said , " I 'm Helen Winning . I live about three houses up the street , and I thought perhaps I might be able to help you . " " Thank you , " the woman said doubtfully . She 's younger than I am , Mrs. Winning thought , she 's about thirty . Andp108pretty . For a clear minute Mrs. Winning saw why the grocer had called her a lady . " It 's so nice to have someone living in this house , " Mrs. Winning said shyly . Past the other woman 's head she could see the small hallway , with the larger living-room beyond and the door on the left going into the kitchen , the stairs on the right , with the delicate stair-rail newly painted ; they had done the hall in light green , and Mrs. Winning smiled with friendshipat the woman in the doorway , thinking , She bas done it right ; this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty houses . After a minute the other woman smiled back , and said , " Will you come in ? " As she stepped back to let Mrs. Winning in , Mrs. Winning wondered with a suddenly stricken conscience if perhaps she had not been too forward , almost pushing herself in . . . . " I hope I 'm not making a nuisance of myself , " she said unexpectedly , turning to the other woman . ' It 's just that I 've been wanting to live here myself for so long . " Why did I say that , she wondered ; it had been a very long time since young Mrs. Winning had said the first thing that came into her head . " Come see my room , " the little boy said urgently , and Mrs. Winning smiled down at him . " I have a little boy just about your age , " she said . " What 's your name ? " " Davey , " the little boy said , moving closer to his mother . " Davey William MacLane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said soberly , " is named Howard Talbot Winning . " The little boy looked up at his mother uncertainly , and Mrs. Winning , who felt ill at ease and awkward in this littlep109house she so longed for , said , " How old are you ? My little boy is five . " " I 'm five , " the little boy said , as though realizing it for the first time . He looked again at his mother and she said graciously , " Will you come in and see what we 've done to the house ? " Mrs. Winning put her bag of groceries down on the slimleggedtable in the green hall , and followed Mrs. MacLane into the living-room , which was L-shaped and had the windowsMrs . Winning would have fitted with gay curtains and flower-boxes . As she stepped into the room Mrs. Winning realized , with a quick wonderful relief , that it was really going to be all right , after all . Everything , from the andirons in the fireplace to the books on the table , was exactly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a little more informal , perhaps , nothing of quite such good quality as young Mrs. Winning might have chosen , but still richly , undeniably right . There was a picture of Davey on the mantel , flanked by a picture which Mrs. Winning supposedwas Davey 's father ; there was a glorious blue bowl on the low coffee table , and around the corner of the L stood a row of orange plates on a shelf , and a polished maple table and chairs . " It 's lovely , " Mrs. Winning said . This could have been mine , she was thinking , and she stood in the doorway and said again , " It 's perfectly lovely . " Mrs. MacLane crossed over to the low armchair by the fireplace and picked up the soft blue material that lay across the arm . " I 'm making curtains , " she said , and touched the blue bowl with the tip of one finger . " Somehow I always make my blue bowl the center of the room , " she said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rug  --  when it comes !  --  will have the same blue in the design . " " It matches Davey 's eyes , " Mrs. Winning said , and when Mrs. MacLane smiled again she saw that it matched Mrs. MacLane 's eyes too . Helpless before so much that was magic to her , Mrs. Winning said " 7-lave you painted the kitchen yellow ? " " Yes , " Mrs. MacLane said , surprised . " Come and see . " She led the way through the L , around past the orange plates to the kitchen , which caught the late morning sun and shone with clean paint and bright aluminum ; Mrs. Winning noticed the electric coffeepot , the waffle iron , the toaster , and thought , she could n't have much trouble cooking , not with just the two of them . " When I have a garden , " Mrs. MacLane said , " we 'll be able to see it from almost all the windows . " She gestured to the broad kitchen windows , and added , " I love gardens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working in this one , as soon as the weather is nice . " " It 's a good house for a garden , " Mrs. Winning said . " I 've heard that it used to be one of the prettiest gardens on the block . " " I thought so too , " Mrs. MacLane said . " I 'm going to have flowers on all four sides of the house . With a cottage like this you can , you know . " Oh , I know , I know , Mrs. Winning thought wistfully , remembering the neat charming garden she could have had , instead of the row of nasturtiums along the side of the Winninghouse , which she tended so carefully ; no flowers would grow well around the Winning house , because of the heavy old maple trees which shaded all the yard and which had been tall when the house was built.  |p111Mrs  . MacLane had had the bathroom upstairs done in yellow , too , and the two small bedrooms with overhanging eaves were painted green and rose . " All garden colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winning , thinking of the oddlymatched , austere bedrooms in the big Winning house , sighed and admitted that it would be wonderful to have window seats under the eaved windows . Davey 's bedroom was the green one , and his small bed was close to the window . " This morning , " he told Mrs. Winning solemnly , " I looked out and there were four icicles hanging by my bed . " Mrs. Winning stayed in the cottage longer than she should have ; she felt certain , although Mrs. MacLane was pleasant and cordial , that her visit was extended past courtesy and into curiosity . Even so , it was only her sudden guilt about the three pounds of hamburger and dinner for the Winning men that drove her away . When she left , waving good-bye to Mrs. MacLane and Davey as they stood in the cottage doorway , she had invited Davey up to play with Howard , Mrs. MacLane up for tea , both of them to come for lunch some day , and all without the permission of her mother-in-law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bolted front door to go up the walk to the back door , which all the family used in the winter . Her mother-in-law looked up as she came into the kitchen and said irritably , " I called the store and Tom said you left an hour ago . " " I stopped off at the old cottage , " Mrs. Winning said . She put the package of groceries down on the table and began to take things out quickly , to get the doughnuts on to a plate and the hamburger into the pan before too much time was lost . With her coat still on and her scarf over her head she moved as fast as she could while her mother-in-law , slicing bread at the kitchen table , watched her silently.  | " Take your coat off , " her mother-in-law said finally . " Your husband will be home in a minute . " By twelve o'clock the house was noisy and full of mud tracked across the kitchen floor . The oldest Howard , Mrs. Winning 's father-in-law , came in from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dark hall before speaking to his wife and daughter-in-law ; the younger Howard , Mrs. Winning 's husband , came in from the barn after puttingthe truck away and nodded to his wife and kissed his mother ; and the youngest Howard , Mrs. Winning 's son , crashed into the kitchen , home from kindergarten , shouting , " Where 's dinner ? " The baby , anticipating food , banged on her high-chair with the silver cup which had first been used by the oldest Howard Winning 's mother . Mrs. Winning and her mother-in-law put plates down on the table swiftly , knowing after many years the exact pause between the latest arrival and the serving of food , and with a minimum of time three generations of the Winning family were eating silently and efficiently , all anxious to be back about their work : the farm , the mill , the electric train ; the dishes , the sewing , the nap . Mrs. Winning , feeding the baby , trying to anticipate her mother-in-law 's gestures of serving , thought , today more poignantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them another Howard , with the Winningeyes and mouth , in exchange for her food and her bed . After dinner , after the men had gone back to work and the children were in bed , the baby for her nap and Howard restingwith crayons and coloring book , Mrs. Winning sat down with her mother-in-law over their sewing and tried to describe the cottage . " It 's just perfect , " she said helplessly . " Everything is sop113pretty . She invited us to come down some day and see it when it 's all finished , the curtains and everything . " " I was talking to Mrs. Blake , " the elder Mrs. Winning said , as though in agreement . " She says the husband was killed in an automobile accident . She had some money in her own name and I guess she decided to settle down in the country for the boy 's health . Mrs. Blake said he looked peakish . " " She loves gardens , " Mrs. Winning said , her needle still in her hand for a moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the house . " " She 'll need help , " the elder woman said humorlessly , " that 's a mighty big garden she 'll have . " " She has the most beautiful blue bowl , Mother Winning . You 'd love it , it 's almost like silver . " " Probably , " the elder Mrs. Winning said after a pause , " probably her people came from around here a ways back , and that 's why she 's settled in these parts . " The next day Mrs. Winning walked slowly past the cottage , and slowly the next , and the day after , and the day after that . On the second day she saw Mrs. MacLane at the window , and waved , and on the third day she met Davey on the sidewalk . " When are you coming to visit my little boy ? " she asked him , and he stared at her solemnly and said , " To-morrow . " Mrs. Burton , next-door to the MacLanes , ran over on the third day they were there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighbors about the yellow kitchen and the bright electric utensils . Another neighbor , whose husband had helped Mrs. MacLane start her furnace , explained that Mrs. MacLanewas only very recently widowed . One or another of the townspeople called on the MacLanes almost daily , and fre- quently , as young Mrs. Winning passed , she saw familiar faces at the windows , measuring the blue curtains with Mrs. MacLane , or she waved to acquaintances who stood chatting with Mrs. MacLane on the now firm front steps . After the MacLaneshad been in the cottage for about a week Mrs. Winning met them one day in the grocery and they walked up the hill together , and talked about putting Davey into the kindergarten . Mrs. MacLane wanted to keep him home as long as possible , and Mrs. Winning asked her , " Do n't you feel terribly tied down , having him with you all the time ? " " I like it , " Mrs. MacLane said cheerfully , " we keep each other company , " and Mrs. Winning felt clumsy and ill-mannered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmer and the first signs of green showed on the trees and on the wet ground , Mrs. Winning and Mrs. MacLane became better friends . They met almost daily at the grocery and walked up the hill together , and twice Davey came up to play with Howard 's electric train , and once Mrs. MacLane came up to get him and stayed for a cup of coffee in the great kitchen while the boys raced round and round the table and Mrs. Winning 's mother-in-law was visiting a neighbor . " It 's such an old house , " Mrs. MacLane said , looking up at the dark ceiling . " I love old houses ; they feel so secure and warm , as though lots of people had been perfectly satisfied with them and they knew how useful they were . You do n't get that feeling with a new house . " " This dreary old place , " Mrs. Winning said . Mrs. MacLane , with a rose-colored sweater and her bright soft hair , was a spot of color in the kitchen that Mrs. Winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything in the world to live in your house , " Mrs. Winning said.  | " I love it , " Mrs. MacLane said . " I do n't think I 've ever been so happy . Everyone around here is so nice , and the house is so pretty , and I planted a lot of bulbs yesterday . " She laughed . " I used to sit in that apartment in New York and dream about planting bulbs again . " Mrs. Winning looked at the boys , thinking how Howard was half-a-head taller , and stronger , and how Davey was small and weak and loved his mother adoringly . " It 's been good for Davey already , " she said . " There 's color in his cheeks . " " Davey loves it , " Mrs. MacLane agreed . Hearing his name Davey came over and put his head in her lap and she touched his hair , bright like her own . " We 'd better be getting on home , Davey boy , " she said . " Maybe our flowers have grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days became miraculously long and warm , and Mrs. MacLane 's garden began to show colors and became an ordered thing , still very young and unsure , but promisingrich brilliance for the end of the summer , and the next summer , and summers ten years from now . " It 's even better than I hoped , " Mrs. MacLane said to Mrs. Winning , standing at the garden gate . " Things grow so much better here than almost anywhere else . " Davey and Howard played daily after the school was out for the summer , and Howard was free all day . Sometimes Howard stayed at Davey 's house for lunch , and they planted a vegetable patch together in the MacLane back yard . Mrs. Winning stopped for Mrs. MacLane on her way to the store in the mornings and Davey and Howard frolicked ahead of them down the street . They picked up their mail together and read it walking back up the hill , and Mrs. Winning went more cheerfully back to the big Winning house after walking most of the way home with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Howard 's wagon and with the two boys they went for a long walk in the country . Mrs. MacLane picked Queen Anne 's lace and put it into the wagon with the baby , and the boys found a garter snake and tried to bring it home . On the way up the hill Mrs. MacLane helped pull the wagon with the baby and the Queen Anne 's lace , and they stopped halfway to rest and Mrs. MacLane said , " Look , I believe you can see my garden all the way from here . " It was a spot of color almost at the top of the hill and they stood looking at it while the baby threw the Queen Anne 's lace out of the wagon . Mrs. MacLane said , " I always want to stop here to look at it , " and then , " Who is that beautiful child ? " Mrs. Winning looked , and then laughed . " He is attractive , is n't he , " she said . " It 's Billy Jones . " She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mrs. MacLane would . He was a boy about twelve , sitting quietly on a wall across the street , with his chin in his hands , silently watching Davey and Howard . " He 's like a young statue , " Mrs. MacLane said . " So brown , and will you look at that face ? " She started to walk again to see him more clearly , and Mrs. Winning followed her . " Do I know his mother and fath  --  ? " " The Jones children are half-Negro , " Mrs. Winning said hastily . " But they 're all beautiful children ; you should see the girl . They live just outside town . " Howard 's voice reached them clearly across the summer air . " Nigger , " he was saying , " nigger , nigger boy . " " Nigger , " Davey repeated , giggling . Mrs. MacLane gasped , and then said , " Davey , " in a voicep117that made Davey turn his head apprehensively ; Mrs. Winning had never heard her friend use such a voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. MacLane said again , and Davey approached slowly . " What did I hear you say ? " " Howard , " Mrs. Winning said , " leave Billy alone . " " Go tell that boy you 're sorry , " Mrs. MacLane said . " Go at once and tell him you 're sorry . " Davey blinked tearfully at his mother and then went to the curb and called across the street , " I 'm sorry . " Howard and Mrs. Winning waited uneasily , and Billy Jones across the street raised his head from his hands and looked at Davey and then , for a long time , at Mrs. MacLane . Then he put his chin on his hands again . Suddenly Mrs. MacLane called , " Young man  --  Will you come here a minute , please ? " Mrs. Winning was surprised , and stared at Mrs. MacLane , but when the boy across the street did not move Mrs. Winningsaid sharply , " Billy ! Billy Jones ! Come here at once ! " The boy raised his head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall and started across the street . When he was across the street and about five feet from them he stopped , waiting . " Hello , " Mrs. MacLane said gently , " what 's your name ? " The boy looked at her for a minute and then at Mrs. Winning , and Mrs. Winning said , " He 's Billy Jones . Answer when you 're spoken to , Billy . " " Billy , " Mrs. MacLane said , " I 'm sorry my little boy called you a name , but he 's very little and he does n't always know what he 's saying . But he 's sorry , too . " " Okay , " Billy said , still watching Mrs. Winning . He was wearing an old pair of blue jeans and a torn white shirt , and 8 he was barefoot . His skin and hair were the same color , the golden shade of a very heavy tan , and his hair curled lightly ; he had the look of a garden statue . " Billy , " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and work for me ? Earn some money ? " " Sure , " Billy said . " Do you like gardening ? " Mrs. MacLane asked . Billy noddedsoberly . " Because , " Mrs. MacLane went on enthusiastically , " I 've been needing someone to help me with my garden , and it would be just the thing for you to do . " She waited a minute and then said , " Do you know where I live ? " " Sure , " Billy said . He turned his eyes away from Mrs. Winning and for a minute looked at Mrs. MacLane , his brown eyes expressionless . Then he looked back at Mrs. Winning , who was watching Howard up the street . " Fine , " Mrs. MacLane said . " Will you come tomorrow ? " " Sure , " Billy said . He waited for a minute , looking from Mrs. MacLane to Mrs. Winning , and then ran back across the street and vaulted over the wall where he had been sitting . Mrs. MacLane watched him admiringly . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start it up the hill again . They were nearly at the MacLane cottage before Mrs. MacLane finally spoke . " I just ca n't stand that , " she said , " to hear children attacking people for things they ca n't help . " " They 're strange people , the Joneses , " Mrs. Winning said readily . " The father works around as a handyman ; maybe you 've seen him . You see  --  " she dropped her voice  --  " the mother was white , a girl from around here . A local girl , " she said again , to make it more clear to a foreigner . " She left the whole litter of them when Billy was about two , and went off with a white man . "  | " Poor children , " Mrs. MacLane said . " They 're all right , " Mrs. Winning said . " The church takes care of them , of course , and people are always giving them things . The girl 's old enough to work now , too . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. MacLane said , when Mrs. Winning hesitated . " Well , people talk about her a lot , you know , " Mrs. Winningsaid . " Think of her mother , after all . And there 's another boy , couple of years older than Billy . " They stopped in front of the MacLane cottage and Mrs. MacLane touched Davey 's hair . " Poor unfortunate child , " she said . " Children will call names , " Mrs. Winning said . " There 's not much you can do . " " Well . . . " Mrs. MacLane said . " Poor child . " The next day , after the dinner dishes were washed , and while Mrs. Winning and her mother-in-law were putting them away , the elder Mrs. Winning said casually , " Mrs. Blake tells me your friend Mrs. MacLane was asking around the neighborshow to get hold of the Jones boy .

She should n't have done it , she was thinking , but her mind refused to tell her why . She should have asked me first , though , she thought finally.  | The next day Mrs. Winning stopped off at the cottage with Mrs. MacLane after coming up the hill from the store . They sat in the yellow kitchen and drank coffee , while the boys played in the back yard . While they were discussing the possibilitiesof hammocks between the apple trees there was a knock at the kitchen door and when Mrs. MacLane opened it she found a man standing there , so that she said , " Yes ? " politely , and waited . " Good morning , " the man said . He took off his hat and nodded his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for someone to work your garden , " he said . " Why . . . " Mrs. MacLane began , glancing sideways uneasilyat Mrs. Winning . " I 'm Billy 's father , " the man said . He nodded his head toward the back yard and Mrs. MacLane saw Billy Jones sittingunder one of the apple trees , his arms folded in front of him , his eyes on the grass at his feet . " How do you do , " Mrs. MacLane said inadequately . " Billy told me you said for him to come work your garden , " the man said . " Well , now , I think maybe a summer job 's too much for a boy his age , he ought to be out playing in the good weather . And that 's the kind of work I do anyway , so 's I thought I 'd just come over and see if you found anyone yet . " He was a big man , very much like Billy , except that where Billy 's hair curled only a little , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around his head where his hat stayed constantly and where Billy 's skin was a golden tan , his father 's skin was darker , almost bronze . When he moved , it was gracefully , like Billy , and his eyes were the same fathomless brown . " Like to work this garden , " Mr. Jones said , looking around . " Could be a mighty nice place . "  | " You were very nice to come , " Mrs. MacLane said . " I certainlydo need help . " Mrs. Winning sat silently , not wanting to speak in front of Mr. Jones . She was thinking , I wish she 'd ask me first , this is impossible . . . and Mr. Jones stood silently , listening courteously , with his dark eyes on Mrs. MacLane while she spoke . " I guess a lot of the work would be too much for a boy like Billy , " she said . " There are a lot of things I ca n't even do myself , and I was sort of hoping I could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fine , then , " Mr. Jones said . " Guess I can manage most of it , " he said , and smiled . " Well , " Mrs. MacLane said , " I guess that 's all settled , then . When do you want to start ? " " How about right now ? " he said . " Grand , " Mrs. MacLane said enthusiastically , and then , " Excuse me for a minute , " to Mrs. Winning over her shoulder . She took down her gardening gloves and wide straw hat from the shelf by the door . " Is n't it a lovely day ? " she asked Mr. Jones as she stepped out into the garden while he stood back to let her pass . " You go along home now , Bill , " Mr. Jones called as they went toward the side of the house . " Oh , why not let him stay ? " Mrs. MacLane said . Mrs. Winning heard her voice going on as they went out of sight . " He can play around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute Mrs. Winning sat looking at the garden , at the corner around which Mr. Jones had followed Mrs. MacLane , and then Howard 's face appeared around the side of the door and he said , " Hi , is it nearly time to eat ? " " Howard , " Mrs. Winning said quietly , and he came in through the door and came over to her . " It 's time for you to run along home , " Mrs. Winning said . " I 'll be along in a min-ute . " Howard started to protest , but she added , " I want you to go right away . Take my bag of groceries if you think you can carry it . " Howard was impressed by her conception of his strength , and he lifted down the bag of groceries ; his shoulders , alreadybroad out of proportion , like his father 's and his grandfather 's , strained under the weight , and then he steadied on his feet . " Are n't I strong ? " he asked exultantly . " Very strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be right up . I 'll just say good-bye to Mrs. MacLane . " Howard disappeared through the house ; Mrs. Winning heard him walking heavily under the groceries , out through the open front door and down the steps . Mrs. Winning rose and was standing by the kitchen door when Mrs. MacLane came back . " You 're not ready to go ? " Mrs. MacLane exclaimed when she saw Mrs. Winning with her jacket on . " Without finishing your coffee ? " " I 'd better catch Howard , " Mrs. Winning said . " He ran along ahead . " " I 'm sorry I left you like that , " Mrs. MacLane said . She stood in the doorway beside Mrs. Winning , looking out into the garden . " How wonderful it all is , " she said , and laughed happily . They walked together through the house ; the blue curtainswere up by now , and the rug with the touch of blue in the design was on the floor . " Good-bye , " Mrs. Winning said on the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look Mrs.p123Winning turned and saw Mr. Jones , his shirt off and his strong back shining in the sun as he bent with a scythe over the long grass at the side of the house . Billy lay nearby , under the shade of the bushes ; he was playing with a grey kitten . " I 'm going to have the finest garden in town , " Mrs. MacLane said proudly . " You wo n't have him working here past today , will you ? " Mrs. Winning asked . " Of course you wo n't have him any longer than just today ? " " But surely  --  " Mrs. MacLane began , with a tolerant smile , and Mrs. Winning , after looking at her for an incredulous minute , turned and started , indignant and embarrassed , up the hill . Howard had brought the groceries safely home and her mother-in-law was already setting the table . " Howard says you sent him home from MacLane 's , " her mother-in-law said , and Mrs. Winning answered briefly , " I thought it was getting late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cottage on her way down to the store she saw Mr. Jones swinging the scythe expertly against the side of the house , and Billy Jones and Davey sitting on the front steps watching him . " Good morning , Davey , " Mrs. Winning called , " is your mother ready to go downstreet ? " " Where 's Howard ? " Davey asked , not moving . " He stayed home with his grandma today , " Mrs. Winning said brightly . " Is your mother ready ? " " She 's making lemonade for Billy and me , " Davey said . " We 're going to have it in the garden . " " Then tell her , " Mrs. Winning said quickly , " tell her that I said I was in a hurry and that I had to go on ahead . I 'll see her later . " She hurried on down the hill.  | in the store she met Mrs. Harris , a lady whose mother had worked for the elder Mrs. Winning nearly forty years before . " Helen , " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ought to stop all this running around . " Mrs. Winning , in the store without Mrs. MacLane for the first time in weeks , smiled shyly and said that she guessed she needed a vacation . " Vacation ! " Mrs. Harris said . " Let that husband of yours do the housework for a change . He does n't have nuthin ' else to do . " She laughed richly , and shook her head . " Nuthin ' else to do , " she said . " The Winnings ! " Before Mrs. Winning could step away Mrs. Harris added , her laughter penetrated by a sudden sharp curiosity : " Where 's that dressed-up friend of yours get to ? Usually downstreet together , ai n't you ? " Mrs. Winning smiled courteously , and Mrs. Harris said , laughing again , " Just could n't believe those shoes of hers , first time I seen them . Them shoes ! " While she was laughing again Mrs. Winning escaped to the meat counter and began to discuss the potentialities of pork shoulder earnestly with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was thinking , are they talking like that about Mrs. MacLane ? Are they laughing at her ? When she thought of Mrs. MacLane she thought of the quiet house , the soft colors , the mother and son in the garden ; Mrs. MacLane'sshoes were green and yellow platform sandals , oddlookingcertainly next to Mrs. Winning 's solid white oxfords , but so inevitably right for Mrs. MacLane 's house , and her garden . . . . Mrs. Harris came up behind her and said , laughingagain , " What 's she got , that Jones fellow working for her now ? "  |p125When  Mrs. Winning reached home , after hurrying up the hill past the cottage , where she saw no one , her mother-in-law was waiting for her in front of the house , watching her come the last few yards . " Early enough today , " her mother-in-law said . " MacLane out of town ? " Resentful , Mrs. Winning said only , " Mrs. Harris nearly drove me out of the store , with her jokes . " " Nothing wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't cure , " the elder Mrs. Winning said . Together , they began to walk around the house to the back door . Mrs. Winning , as they walked , noticed that the grass under the trees had greened up nicely , and that the nasturtiumsbeside the house were bright . " I 've got something to say to you , Helen , " the elder Mrs. Winning said finally . " Yes ? " her daughter-in-law said . " It 's the MacLane girl , about her , I mean . You know her so well , you ought to talk to her about that colored man working there . " " I suppose so , " Mrs. Winning said . " You sure you told her ? You told her about those people ? " " I told her , " Mrs. Winning said . " He 's there every blessed day , " her mother-in-law said . " And working out there without his shirt on . He goes in the house . " And that evening Mr. Burton , next-door neighbor to Mrs. MacLane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new lot of shingles at the mill ; he turned , suddenly , to Mrs. Winning , who was sitting sewing next to her motherin-lawat the table in the front room , and raised his voice a little when he said , " Helen , I wish you 'd tell your friend Mrs. MacLane to keep that kid of hers out of my vegetables . "  | " Davey ? " Mrs. Winning said involuntarily . " No , " Mr. Burton said , while all the Winnings looked at the younger Mrs. Winning , " no , the other one , the colored boy . He 's been running loose through our back yard . Makes me sort of mad , that kid coming in spoiling other people 's property . You know , " he added , turning to the Howard Winnings , " you know , that does make a person mad . " There was a silence , and then Mr. Burton added , rising heavily , " Guess I 'll say good-night to you people . " They all attended him to the door and came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do something , Mrs. Winning was thinking , pretty soon they 'll stop coming to me first , they 'll tell someone else to speak to me . She looked up , found her mother-in-law looking at her , and they both looked down quickly . Consequently Mrs. Winning went to the store the next morning earlier than usual , and she and Howard crossed the street just above the MacLane house , and went down the hill on the other side . " Are n't we going to see Davey ? " Howard asked once , and Mrs. Winning said carelessly , " Not today , Howard . Maybe your father will take you out to the mill this afternoon . " She avoided looking across the street at the MacLane house , and hurried to keep up with Howard . Mrs. Winning met Mrs. MacLane occasionally after that at the store or the post office , and they spoke pleasantly . When Mrs. Winning passed the cottage after the first week or so , she was no longer embarrassed about going by , and even looked at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Mr. Jones 's broad back was usually visible through the bushes ,  |p127and  Billy Jones sat on the steps or lay on the grass with Davey . One morning on her way down the hill Mrs. Winning heard a conversation between Davey MacLane and Billy Jones ; they were in the bushes together and she heard Davey 's high familiarvoice saying , " Billy , you want to build a house with me today ? " " Okay , " Billy said . Mrs. Winning slowed her steps a little to hear . " We 'll build a big house out of branches , " Davey said excitedly , " and when it 's finished we 'll ask my mommy if we can have lunch out there . " " You ca n't build a house just out of branches , " Billy said . " You ought to have wood , and boards . " " And chairs and tables and dishes , " Davey agreed . " And walls . " " Ask your mommy can we have two chairs out here , " Billy said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And I 'll get us some cookies , too , " Davey said . " And we 'll ask my mommy and your daddy to come in our house . " Mrs. Winning heard them shouting as she went down along the sidewalk . You have to admit , she told herself as though she were being strictly just , you have to admit that he 's doing a lot with that garden ; it 's the prettiest garden on the street . And Billy acts as though he had as much right there as Davey . As the summer wore on into long hot days undistinguishableone from another , so that it was impossible to tell with any real accuracy whether the light shower had been yesterdayor the day before , the Winnings moved out into their yard to sit after supper , and in the warm darkness Mrs. Winningsometimes found an opportunity of sitting next to her husband so that she could touch his arm ; she was never able to teach Howard to run to her and put his head in her lap , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she consoled herself with the thought that at least they were a family , a solid respectable thing . The hot weather kept up , and Mrs. Winning began to spend more time in the store , postponing the long aching walk up the hill in the sun . She stopped and chatted with the grocer , with other young mothers in the town , with older friends of her mother-in-law 's , talking about the weather , the reluctance of the town to put in a decent swimming pool , the work that had to be done before school started in the fall , chickenpox , the P.T.A . One morning she met Mrs. Burton in the store , and they spoke of their husbands , the heat , and the hot-weather occupations of their children before Mrs. Burton said : " By the way , Johnny will be six on Saturday and he 's having a birthday party ; can Howard come ? " " Wonderful , " Mrs. Winning said , thinking , His good white shorts , the dark blue shirt , a carefully-wrapped present . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the lovingcarelessness mothers use in planning the birthday parties of their children . " They 'll stay for supper , of course  --  send Howard down about three-thirty . " " That sounds so nice , " Mrs. Winning said . " He 'll be delightedwhen I tell him . " " I thought I 'd have them all play outdoors most of the time , " Mrs. Burton said . " In this weather . And then perhaps a few games indoors , and supper . Keep it simple  --  you know . " She hesitated , running her finger around and around the top rim of a can of coffee . " Look , " she said , " I hope you wo n't mind me asking , but would it be all right with you if I did n't invite the MacLane boy ? "  |p129Mrs  . Winning felt sick for a minute , and had to wait for her voice to even out before she said lightly , " It 's all right with me if it 's all right with you ; why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I just thought you might mind if he did n't come . " Mrs. Winning was thinking . Something bad has happened , somehow people think they know something about me that they wo n't say , they all pretend it 's nothing , but this never happened to me before ; I live with the Winnings , do n't I ? " Really , " she said , putting the weight of the old Winning house into her voice , " why in the world would it bother me ? " Did I take it too seriously , she was wondering , did I seem too anxious , should I have let it go ? Mrs. Burton was embarrassed , and she set the can of coffee down on the shelf and began to examine the other shelves studiously . " I 'm sorry I mentioned it at all , " she said . Mrs. Winning felt that she had to say something further , something to state her position with finality , so that no longer would Mrs. Burton , at least , dare to use such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question with " I hope you do n't mind me asking . " " After all , " Mrs. Winning said carefully , weighing the words , " she 's like a second mother to Billy . " Mrs. Burton , turning to look at Mrs. Winning for confirmation , grimaced and said , " Good Lord , Helen ! " Mrs. Winning shrugged and then smiled and Mrs. Burton smiled and then Mrs. Winning said , " I do feel so sorry for the little boy , though . " Mrs. Burton said , " Such a sweet little thing , too . " Mrs. Winning had just said , " He and Billy are together all the time now , " when she looked up and saw Mrs. MacLane regarding her from the end of the aisle of shelves ; it was impossible to tell whether she had heard them or not . For a minute Mrs. Winning looked steadily back at Mrs. MacLane , and then she said , with just the right note of cordiality , " Good morning , Mrs. MacLane . Where is your little boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mrs. MacLane said , and moved on past the aisle of shelves , and Mrs. Burton caught Mrs. Winning 's arm and made a desperate gesture of hiding her face and , unable to help themselves , both she and Mrs. Winningbegan to laugh . Soon after that , although the grass in the Winning yard under the maple trees stayed smooth and green , Mrs. Winning began to notice in her daily trips past the cottage that Mrs. MacLane 's garden was suffering from the heat . The flowers wilted under the morning sun , and no longer stood up fresh and bright ; the grass was browning slightly and the rose bushes Mrs. MacLane had put in so optimistically were noticeablydying . Mr. Jones seemed always cool , working steadily ; sometimes bent down with his hands in the earth , sometimes tall against the side of the house , setting up a trellis or pruninga tree , but the blue curtains hung lifelessly at the windows . Mrs. MacLane still smiled at Mrs. Winning in the store , and then one day they met at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a minute , Mrs. MacLane said , " Can you come in for a few minutes ? I 'd like to have a talk , if you have time . " " Surely , " Mrs. Winning said courteously , and followed Mrs. MacLane up the walk , still luxuriously bordered with floweringbushes , but somehow disenchanted , as though the summer heat had baked away the vivacity from the ground . In thep131familiar living-room Mrs. Winning sat down on a straight chair , holding herself politely stiff , while Mrs. MacLane sat as usual in her armchair . " How is Davey ? " Mrs. Winning asked finally , since Mrs. MacLane did not seem disposed to start any conversation . " He 's very well , " Mrs. MacLane said , and smiled as she always did when speaking of Davey . " He 's out back with Billy . " There was a quiet minute , and then Mrs. MacLane said , staring at the blue bowl on the coffee table , " What I wanted to ask you is , what on earth is gone wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readiness for some such question , and when she said , " I do n't know what you mean , " she thought , I sound exactly like Mother Winning , and realized , I 'm enjoying this , just as she would ; and no matter what she thought of herself she was unable to keep from adding , " 7s something wrong ? " " Of course , " Mrs. MacLane said . She stared at the blue bowl , and said slowly , " When I first came , everyone was so nice , and they seemed to like Davey and me and want to help us . That 's wrong , Mrs. Winning was thinking , you must n't ever talk about whether people like you , that 's bad taste . " And the garden was going so well , " Mrs. MacLane said helplessly . " And now , no one ever does more than just speak to us  --  I used to say Good morning ' over the fence to Mrs. Burton , and she 'd come to the fence and we 'd talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and goes in the house  --  and no one ever smiles , or anything . " This is dreadful , Mrs. Winning thought , this is childish , this is complaining . People treat you as you treat them , she thought ; she wanted desperately to go over and take Mrs. MacLane 's hand and ask her to come back and be one of the nice people again ; but she only sat straighter in the chair and said , " I 'm sure you must be mistaken . I 've never heard anyone speak of it . " " Are you sure ? " Mrs. MacLane turned and looked at her . " Are you sure it is n't because of Mr. Jones working here ? " Mrs. Winning lifted her chin a little higher and said , " Why on earth would anyone around here be rude to you because of Jones ? " Mrs. MacLane came with her to the door , both of them planning vigorously for the days some time next week , when they would all go swimming , when they would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking , The nerve of her , trying to blame the colored folks . Toward the end of the summer there was a bad thunderstorm , breaking up the prolonged hot spell . It raged with heavy wind and rain over the town all night , sweeping withoutpity through the trees , pulling up young bushes and flowers ruthlessly ; a barn was struck on one side of town , the wires pulled down on another . In the morning Mrs. Winning opened the back door to find the Winning yard littered with small branches from the maples , the grass bent almost flat to the ground . Her mother-in-law came to the door behind her . " Quite a storm , " she said , " did it wake you ? " " I woke up once and went to look at the children , " Mrs. Winning said . " It must have been about three o'clock . " " I was up later , " her mother-in-law said . " I looked at the children too ; they were both asleep . " They turned together and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started down to the store ; she had almost reached the MacLane cottage when she saw Mrs. MacLane standing in the front garden with Mr. Jones standing beside her and Billy Jones with Davey in the shadows of the front porch . They were all looking silently at a great branch from one of the Burtons ' trees that lay across the centerof the garden , crushing most of the flowering bushes and pinning down what was to have been a glorious tulip bed . As Mrs. Winning stopped , watching , Mrs. Burton came out on to her front porch to survey the storm-damage , and Mrs. MacLanecalled to her , " Good morning , Mrs. Burton , it looks like we have part of your tree over here . " " Looks so , " Mrs. Burton said , and she went back into her house and closed the door flatly . Mrs. Winning watched while Mrs. MacLane stood quietly for a minute . Then she looked up at Mr. Jones almost hopefullyand she and Mr. Jones looked at one another for a long time . Then Mrs. MacLane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washed clean by the storm : " Do you think I ought to give it up , Mr. Jones ? Go back to the city where I 'll never have to see another garden ? " Mr. Jones shook his head despondently , and Mrs. MacLane , her shoulders tired , went slowly over and sat on her front steps and Davey came and sat next to her . Mr. Jones took hold of the great branch angrily and tried to move it , shaking it and pulling until his shoulders tensed with the strength he was bringing to bear , but the branch only gave slightly and stayed , clinging to the garden . " Leave it alone , Mr. Jones , " Mrs. MacLane said finally . " Leave it for the next people to move ! " But still Mr. Jones pulled against the branch , and then suddenly Davey stood up and cried out , " There 's Mrs. Winning ! Hi , Mrs. Winning ! " Mrs. MacLane and Mr. Jones both turned , and Mrs. MacLanewaved and called out , " Hello ! " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity , back up the hill toward the old Winning house.  |p135THERE  USED TO BE a time of year in San Francisco  --  in late March , I believe  --  when there was fine long windy weather , and the air all over the city had a touch of salt and the freshnessof the sea . And then , some time after the wind first started , you could look around Market Street and Van Ness and Kearney , and the fleet was in . That , of course , was some time ago , but you could look out around the Golden Gate , unbridged at that time , and there would be the battleships . There may have been aircraft carriers and destroyers , and I believe I recall one submarine , but to Dot and me then they were battleships , all of them . They would be riding out there on the water , quiet and competently grey , and the streets would be full of sailors , walking with the roll of the sea and looking in shop windows . I never knew what the fleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was for refueling ; but from the time the wind first started , Dot and I would become more aware , walking closer together , and dropping our voices when we talked . Although we were all of thirty miles from where the fleet lay , when we walked with our backs to the ocean we could feel the battleships riding somewhere behind and beyondus , and when we looked toward the ocean we narrowed our eyes , almost able to see across thirty miles and into a sailor 's face . It was the sailors , of course . My mother told us about the kind of girls who followed sailors , and my grandmother told us about the kind of sailors who followed girls . When we told Dot 's mother the fleet was in , she would say earnestly , " Do n't go near any sailors , you two . " Once , when Dot and I were about twelve , and the fleet was in , my mother stood us up and looked at us intensely for a minute , and then she turned around to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of young girls going to the movies alone at night , " and my grandmothersaid , " Nonsense , they wo n't come this far down the peninsula ; I know sailors . " Dot and I were permitted only one movie at night a week , anyway , and even then they sent my ten-year-old brother along with us . The first time the three of us started off to the movies together my mother looked at Dot and me again and then speculatively at my brother , who had red curly hair , and started to say something , and then looked at my grandmother and changed her mind . We lived in Burlingame , which is far enough away from San Francisco to have palm trees in the gardens , but near enough so that Dot and I were taken into San Francisco , to the Emporium , to get our spring coats each year . Dot 's mother usually gave Dot her coat money , which Dot handed over to my mother , and then Dot and I got identical coats , with my mother officiating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go into San Francisco shopping , and particularlynot with Dot and me . Consequently every year , some time after the wind started and the fleet came in , Dot and I , in service-weight silk stockings which we kept for that occasion , and each with a cardboard pocketbook containing a mirror , a dime for luck , and a chiffon handkerchief caught at one side and hanging down , got into the back seat of my mother 's car with my mother and grandmother in the front , and headed for San Francisco and the fleet.  |p137We  always got our coats in the morning , went to the Pig'n ' - Whistle for lunch , and then , while Dot and I were finishing our chocolate ice cream with chocolate sauce and walnuts , my grandmother phoned my Uncle Oliver and arranged to meet him at the launch which took us out to the fleet . My Uncle Oliver was taken along partly because he was a man and partly because in the previous war he had been a radio operator on a battleship and partly because another uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Navy ( my grandmother thought he had something to do with a battleshipnamed the Santa Volita , or Bonita , or possibly Carmelita ) , and my Uncle Oliver was handy for asking people who looked like they might know my Uncle Paul if they did know him . As soon as we got on a boat my grandmother would say , as though she had never thought of it before , " Look , that one over there seems to be an officer ; 011ie , just go over casually and ask him if he knows old Paul . " Oliver , having been one himself , did n't think that sailors were particularly dangerous to Dot and me if we had my mother and my grandmother with us , but he loved ships , and so he went with us and left us the minute we were on board ; while we stepped cautiously over the clean decks eyeing the lifeboats apprehensively , my Uncle Oliver would touch the grey paint affectionately and go off in search of the radio apparatus . When we met my Uncle Oliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ice-cream cone each and on the launch he would point out various boats around and name them for us . He usually got into a conversation with the sailor running the launch , and sooner or later he managed to say modestly , " I was to sea , back in ' 17 , " and the sailor would nod respectfully . When it came time for us to leave the launch and go up a stairway on to the battleship , my mother whispered to Dot and me , " Keep your skirts down , " and Dot and I climbed the ladder , holding on with one hand and with the other wrapping our skirts tight around us into a bunch in front which we held on to . My grandmother always preceded us onto the battleship and my mother and Uncle Oliver followedus . When we got on board my mother took one of us by the arm and my grandmother took the other and we walked slowly around all of the ship they allowed us to see , excepting only the lowest levels , which alarmed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my grandmother said were aft , and lights which she said were port ( both sides were port to my grandmother ; she believed that starboard was up , in the sense that the highest mast always pointed at the north star . ) Usually we saw cannon  --  all guns were cannon  --  which my Uncle Oliver , in what must have been harmless teasing , assured my grandmother were kept loaded all the time . " In case of mutiny , " he told my grandmother . There were always a great many sight-seers on the battleships , and my Uncle Oliver was fond of gathering a little group of boys and young men around him to explain how the radio system worked . When he said he had been a radio operator back in ' 17 someone was sure to ask him , " Did you ever send out an S.O.S. ? " and my Uncle Oliver would nod heavily , and say , " But I 'm still here to tell about it . " Once , while my Uncle Oliver was telling about ' 17 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rail at the ocean , I saw a dress that looked like my mother 's and followed it for quite a way down the battleship before the lady turned around and I realized that it was not myp139mother and I was lost . Remembering what my grandmother had told me , that I was always safe if I did n't lose my head , I stood still and looked around until I isolated a tall man in a uniform with lots of braid . That will be a captain , I thought , and he will certainly take care of me . He was very polite . I told him I was lost and thought my mother and my grandmotherand my friend Dot and my Uncle Oliver were down the boat a ways but I was afraid to go back alone . He said he would help me find them , and he took my arm and led me down the boat . Before very long we met my mother and my grandmother hurrying along looking for me with Dot coming along behind them as fast as she could . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm , pulling me away from the captain and shaking me . " You gave us the scare of our lives , " she said . " She was just lost , that 's all , " the captain said . " I 'm glad we found her in time , " my grandmother said , walking backward with me to my mother . The captain bowed and went away , and my mother took my other arm and shook me . " Are n't you ashamed ? " she said . Dot stared at me solemnly . " But he was a captain  --  " I began . " He might have said he was a captain , " my grandmother said , " but he was a marine . " " A marine ! " my mother said , looking over the side to see if the launch was there to take us back . " Get Oliver and tell him we 've seen enough , " she said to my grandmother . Because of what happened that evening , that was the last year we were allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , as usual , and my mother and my grandmothertook Dot and me to the Merry-Go-Round for dinner.  | We always had dinner in San Francisco after the fleet , and went to a movie and got home to Burlingame late in the evening . We always had dinner in the Merry-Go-Round , where the food came along on a moving platform and you grabbed it as it went by . We went there because Dot and I loved it , and next to the battleships it was the most dangerous place in San Francisco , because you had to pay fifteen cents for every dish you took and did n't finish , and Dot and I were expected to pay for these mistakes out of our allowances . Thislast evening Dot and I lost forty-five cents , mainly because of a mocha cream dessert that Dot had n't known was full of coconut . The movie Dot and I chose was full , although the usher outside told my grandmother there were plenty of seats . My mother refused to wait in line to get our money back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take our chances on seats . As soon as two seats were vacant my grandmothershoved Dot and me toward them , and we sat down . The picture was well under way when the two seats next to Dot emptied , and we were looking for my grandmother and my mother when Dot looked around suddenly and then grabbed my arm . " Look , " she said in a sort of groan , and there were two sailors coming along the row of seats toward the empty ones . They reached the seats just as my mother and grandmother got down to the other end of the row , and my grandmother had just time to say loudly , " You leave those girls alone , " when two seats a few aisles away were vacated and they had to go sit down . Dot moved far over in her seat next to me and clung to my arm . " What are they doing ? " I whispered . " They 're just sitting there , " Dot said . " What do you think I ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't pay any attention , " I said . " Maybe they 'll go away . " " You can talk , " Dot said tragically , " they 're not next toyou. , , " I 'm next to you , " I said reasonably , " that 's pretty close . " " What are they doing now ? " Dot asked . I leaned forward again . " They 're looking at the picture , " I said . " I ca n't stand it , " Dot said . " I want to go home . " Panic overwhelmed both of us at once , and fortunately my mother and my grandmother saw us running up the aisle and caught us outside . " What did they say ? " my grandmother demanded . " I 'll tell the usher . " My mother said if Dot would calm down enough to talk she would take us into the tea room next door and get us each a hot chocolate . When we got inside and were sitting down we told my mother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot chocolate we would have a chocolate sundae apiece . Dot had even started to cheer up a little when the door of the tea room opened and two sailors walked in . With one wild bound Dot was in back of my grandmother 's chair , cowering and clutching my grandmother 's arm . " Do n't let them get me , " she wailed . " They followed us , " my mother said tautly . My grandmother put her arms around Dot . " Poor child , " she said , " you 're safe with us . " Dot had to stay at my house that night . We sent my brother over to Dot 's mother to tell her that Dot was staying with me and that Dot had bought a grey tweed coat with princess lines , very practical and warmly interlined . She wore it all that year . IIIThe Confession of Margaret Jackson , relict of The ) . Stuart in Shaves , who being examined by the Justices anent her being guilty of Witchcraft , declares . . .

Joseph Glanvil : Sadducismus Triumphatusp145THE DOCTOR was competent-looking and respectable . Mrs. Arnold felt vaguely comforted by his appearance , and her agitation lessened a little .

" I 'm very much upset , " Mrs. Arnold said . She tried to talk slowly and intelligently . " That 's one reason I came to you instead of going to Doctor Murphy  --  our regular doctor , that is . The doctor frowned slightly . " My husband , " Mrs. Arnold went on . " I do n't want him to know that I 'm worried , and Doctor Murphy would probably feel it was necessary to tell him . " The doctor nodded , not committing himself , Mrs. Arnoldnoted . " What seems to be the trouble ? " Mrs. Arnold took a deep breath . " Doctor , " she said , " how do people tell if they 're going crazy ? " The doctor looked up . " Is n't that silly , " Mrs. Arnold said . " I had n't meant to say it like that . It 's hard enough to explain anyway , without makingit so dramatic . " " Insanity is more complicated than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it 's complicated , " Mrs. Arnold said .

" Mrs. Arnold sat back and took her gloves out from under her pocketbook and put them carefully on top . Then she took them and put them underneaththe pocketbook again . " Suppose you just tell me all about it , " the doctor said . Mrs. Arnold sighed . " Everyone else seems to understand , " she said , " and I do n't . Look . " She leaned forward and gesturedwith one hand while she spoke . " I do n't understand the way people live . It all used to be so simple .

He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her voice rising slightly . " Look . Yesterday morning my husband stopped on his way to his office to buy a paper .

" Mrs. Arnold 's voice rose to a wail . " He really said deflationary inflation . " " Mrs. Arnold , " the doctor said , coming around the desk , " we 're not going to help things any this way .

" Before the doctor could stop her she walked to the door and opened it . " Reality , " she said , and went out.  |p149JUST  BEFORE the alarm went off she was lying in a hot sunny garden , with green lawns around her and stretching as far as she could see . The bell of the clock was an annoyance , a warning which had to be reckoned with ; she moved uneasilyin the hot sun and knew she was awake . When she opened her eyes and it was raining and she saw the white outline of the window against the grey sky , she tried to turn over and bury her face in the green grass , but it was morning and habit was lifting her up and dragging her away into the rainy dull day . It was definitely past eight o'clock . The clock said so , the radiator was beginning to crackle , and on the street two stories below she could hear the ugly morning noises of people stirring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctantly out from under the blankets and on to the floor , and swung herself up to sit on the edge of the bed . By the time she was standing up and in her bathrobe the day had fallen into its routine ; after the first involuntary rebellion against every day 's alarm she subsided regularly into the shower , make-up , dress , breakfastschedule which would take her through the beginning of the day and out into the morning where she could forget the green grass and the hot sun and begin to look forward to dinner and the evening . Because it was raining and the day seemed unimportant she put on the first things she came to ; a grey tweed suit that she knew was shapeless and heavy on her now that she was so thin , a blue blouse that never felt comfortable . She knew150 The Lottery Elizabeth 151p150her own face too well to enjoy the long careful scrutiny that went with putting on make-up ; toward four o'clock in the afternoonher pale narrow cheeks would warm up and fill out , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes would take on a rosier touch in spite of the blue blouse , but this morning she thought , as she had thought nearly every morning standing in front of her mirror , I wish I 'd been a blonde ; never realizing quite that it was because there were thin hints of grey in her hair . She walked quickly around her one-room apartment , with a sureness that came of habit rather than conviction ; after more than four years in this one home she knew all its possibilities , how it could put on a sham appearance of warmth and welcomewhen she needed a place to hide in , how it stood over her in the night when she woke suddenly , how it could relax itself into a disagreeable unmade , badly-put-together state , mornings like this , anxious to drive her out and go back to sleep . The book she had read the night before lay face down on the end table , the ashtray next to it dirtied : the clothes she had taken off lay over the back of a chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her coat and hat on , she made the bed quickly , pulling it straight on top over the wrinkles beneath , stuffed the clothes to go to the cleaner into the back of the closet , and thought , I 'll dust and straighten and maybe wash the bathroom tonight , come home and take a hot bath and wash my hair and do my nails ; by the time she had locked the apartment door behind her and started down the stairs , she was thinking , Maybe today1 ' 11 stop in and get some bright material for slip-covers and drapes . I could make them evenings and the place would n't look so dreary when I wake up mornings ; yellow , I could get some yellow dishes and put them along the wallp151in a row . Like in . Mademoiselle or something , she told herself ironically as she stopped at the front door , the brisk young businesswoman and her one-room home . Suitable for entertainingbrisk young businessmen . I wish I had something that folded up into a bookcase on one side and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining-room table big enough to seat twelve . While she was standing just inside the door , pulling on her gloves and hoping the rain might stop in these few seconds , the door next to the stairway opened and a woman said , " Who 's that ? " " It 's Miss Style , " she said , " Mrs. Anderson ? " The door opened wide and an old woman put her head out . " I thought it was that fellow has the apartment right over you , " she said . " I been meaning to catch him about leaving them skis outside his door . Nearly broke my leg . " " I 've been wishing I did n't have to go out . It 's such a bad day . The old woman came out of her room and went to the front door . She pulled aside the door curtain and looked out , wrapping her arms around herself . She was wearing a dirty house dress and the sight of her made Miss Style 's grey tweed suit suddenly seem clean and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two days now , " the old woman said . " He goes in and out so quiet . " She giggled , looking sideways at Miss Style . " I nearly caught that man of yours night before last , " she said . " He comes down the stairs quiet , too . I saw who it was in time , " and she giggled again . " I guess all the men come downstairs quiet . All afraid of something . " " Well , if I 'm going to go out I might as well do it , " Miss Style said . She still stood in the doorway for a minute , hesi- tating before walking out into the day and the rain and the people . She lived on a fairly quiet street , where later there would be children shouting at each other and on a nice day an organ-grinder , but today in the rain everything looked dirty . She hated to wear rubbers because she had graceful slim feet ; on a day like this she went slowly , stepping carefullybetween @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few people still sitting at the counter in the corner drugstore . She sat on a stool , reconciled to the time , and waited patiently until the clerk came down the counter with her orange juice . " Hello , Tommy , " she said dismally . " Morning , Miss Style , " he said , " lousy day . " " Is n't it , " she said . " A fine day not to go out . " " I came in this morning , " Tommy said . " I would have given my right arm to stay home in bed . There ought to be a law against rain . " Tommy was little and ugly and alert ; looking at him , Miss Style thought , He has to get up and come to work in the mornings just like I do and just like everyone else in the world ; the rain is just another break in the millions of lousy things , in getting up and going to work . " I do n't mind snow , " Tommy was saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I sure do hate rain . " He turned suddenly when someone called him , and went dancing down to the other end of the counter , bringing up with a flourish before his customer . " Lousy day , is n't it ? " he said . " Sure do wish I was in Florida . " Miss Style drank her orange juice , remembering her dream . A sharp recollection of flowers and warmth came into hermind , and then was lost before the cold driving rain outside . Tommy came back with her coffee and a plate of toast.  | " Nothing like coffee to cheer you up in the morning , " he said . " Thanks , Tommy , " she said , unenthusiastic . " How 's your play coming , by the way ? " Tommy looked up eagerly . " Hey , " he said , " I finished it , I meant to tell you . Finished the whole thing and sent it away day before yesterday . " Funny thing , she thought , a clerk in a drugstore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks around and writes a play just like it was real , just like the rest of us , like me . " Fine , " she said . " I sent it to an agent a guy told me about , he said it was the best agent he knew . " " Tommy , " she said , " why did n't you give it right to me ? " He laughed , looking down at the sugar bowl he was holding for her . " Listen , " he said , " my friend said you did n't want stuff like mine , you want people , like , from out of town or something , they do n't know if they 're any good or not . Hell , " he went on anxiously , " I 'm not one of these guys fall for ads in the magazines . " " I see , " she said . Tommy leaned over the counter . " Do n't get sore , " he said , " You know what I mean , you know your business better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . She watched Tommy hurry away again , and she thought  --  Wait till I tell Robbie . Wait till I tell him the soda jerk thinks he 's a bum . " Listen , " Tommy said to her , from halfway down the counter , " how long do you think I ought to wait ? How long will they take to read it , these agents ? " " Couple of weeks , maybe , " she said . " Maybe longer . " " I figured it might be , " he said . " You want more coffee today ? "  | " No , thanks , " she said . She slid down from the stool and walked across the store to pay her check . They 're probably going to buy that play , she was thinking , and I 'm going to start eating in the hamburg joint across the street . She went out into the rain again to see her bus just pulling up across the street . She ran for it , against the light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a kind of fury left over from Tommy and his play she thrust her way against the people , and a woman turned to her and said , " Who do you think you 're pushing ? " Vengefully she put her elbow into the woman 's ribs and got on the bus first . She dropped her nickel in and got to the last available seat , and heard the woman behind her . " These people who think they can shove anybody around , they think they 're important . " She looked around to see if anyone knew who the woman was talking about ; the man beside her on the seat next to the window was staring straight ahead with the infinitely tired expression of the early-morning bus passenger ; two girls in the seat in front were looking out the window after a man passing , and in the aisle next to her the woman was standing , still talking about her . " People who think their business is the only importantthing in the world . Think they can just push anyone around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wet and uncomfortable and crowded , but the woman went on monotonously  --  " Think no one else has a right to ride on buses . " She stared past the man out the window until the crowds coming into the bus pushed the woman past her down the aisle . When she came to her stop she was timid for a minute about pushing her way out , and when she reached the door the woman was near it , staring at her as though wanting top155remember her face . " Dried-up old maid , " the woman said loudly , and the people around her in the bus laughed . Miss Style put on an expression of contempt , stepping carefullydown to the curb , looking up just as the bus pulled away to see the woman 's face still watching her from the window . She walked through the rain to the old building where her office was , thinking , That woman was just waiting for anyone to cross her path this morning , I wish I 'd said something back to her . " Morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Morning , " she said . She walked into the open-work iron elevator and leaned against the back wall . " Bad day , " the operator said . He waited for a minute and then closed the door . " Fine day not to go out , " he said . " Sure is , " she said . I wish I 'd said something to that woman in the bus , she was thinking . I should n't have let her get away with it , let the day start off like that , with a nasty incident , I should have answered her back and got to feeling good and pleased with myself . Start the day off right . " Here you are , " the operator said . " You do n't have to go out again for quite a while . " " Glad of that , " she said . She got out of the elevator and walked down the hall to her office . There was a light on inside , making the ROBERT S7-IAX , Literary Agents , stand out against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robbie must be in early . She had worked for Robert Shax for nearly eleven years . When she came to New York the Christmas she was twenty , a thin dark girl with neat clothes and hair and moderate ambition , holding on to her pocketbook with both hands , afraid of subways , she answered an ad , and met Robert Shax before she had even found a room to live in . It had been one of those windfall ads , an assistant wanted in a literary agency , and there was no one around to tell Elizabeth Style , asking people timidly how to find the address , that if she got the job it was n't worth getting . The literary agency was Robert Shax and a thin clever man who had disliked Elizabeth so violently that after two years she had taken Robert Shax away to start his own agency . Robert Shax was on the door and on all the checks , and Elizabeth Style hid away in her office , wrote the letters , kept the records , and came out occasionally to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display . They had spent much time in the eight years trying to make this office look like a severe environment for a flourishing business : a miserable place that its owners were too busy to pretty up more than enough to meet the purposes of its clients . The door opened into a tight little reception room , painted tan the year before , with two cheap chrome and brown chairs , a brown linoleum floor , and a framed picture of a vase of flowers over the small desk which was occupied five afternoons a week by a Miss Wilson , a colorless girl who answered the phone sniffling . Beyond Miss Wilson 's desk were two doors , which did not give the effect of limitless offices , stretching on down the building , that Robert Shax had hoped they might ; the one on the left had , on the door , " Robert Shax , " and the one on the right had , on the door , " Elizabeth Style , " and through the pebbled glass doors you could see , dimly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close enough to the door and walls to admit that the two offices together were no wider than the reception room , and to hint darkly that all that protected the privacy of Mr. Shax and Miss Style was a beaverboard partition painted to look like the walls.  |p157Every  morning Elizabeth Style came into the office with the idea that something might be done for it still , that somehow there might be a way to make it look respectable , with Venetianblinds or paneling or an efficient-looking bookcase with sets of classics and the newest books that Robert Shax had presumably sold to their publishers . Or even an end table with expensive magazines . Miss Wilson thought it would be nice to have a radio , but Robert Shax wanted an expensive office with heavy carpeting and desks sitting solidly on the floor and a battery of secretaries . This morning the office looked more cheerful than usual , probably because it was still raining outside , or else because the lights were already on and the radiators were going . ElizabethStyle went over to the door of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robbie , " because , since there was no one in the office , there was no need to pretend that the beaverboardpartitions were walls . " Morning , Liz , " Robbie said , and then , " Come on in , will you ? " " I 'll take my coat off , " she said . There was a tiny closet in the corner of her office where she hung up her coat , squeezingin back of the desk to do it . She noticed that there was mail on her desk , four or five letters and a bulky envelope that would be a manuscript . She spread the letters out to make sure there was nothing of any particular interest , and then went out of her office and opened the door of Robbie 's . He was leaning down over his desk , in an attitude meant to show extreme concentration ; the faintly bald top of his head was toward her and his heavy round shoulders cut off the lower half of the window . His office was almost exactly like hers ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with deepest gratitude , Jim , " and Robert Shax was fond of using it as a happy example in his office conversations with eager authors . When she had closed the door Elizabeth was only a step away from the straight visitor 's chair slanting at the desk ; she sat down and stretched her feet out in front of her . " I got soaked coming in this morning , " she said . " It 's an awful day , " Robbie said , without looking up . When he was alone with her he relaxed the heartiness that he usually stocked in his voice : he let his face look tired and worried . He was wearing his good grey suit that day , and later , with other people around , he would look like a golfer , a man who ate good rare roast beef and liked pretty girls . " It 's one hell of a day , " he repeated . He looked up at her . " Liz , " he said , " that goddamned minister is in town again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . She had been ready to complain at him , to tell him about the woman on the bus , to ask him to sit up straight and behave , but there was nothing to say . " Poor old Robbie , " she said . " There 's a note from him , " Robbie said . " I 've got to go up there this morning . He 's in that goddamned rooming-house again . " " What are you planning to tell him ? " Robbie got up and turned around to the window . When he got out of his chair he had just room to turn around to get to the window of the closet or the filing cabinet ; on a pleasanterday she might have an amiable remark about his weight . " I do n't know what in hell I 'm planning to tell him , " Robbie said . " I 'll promise him something . " I know you will , she thought . She had the familiar picture of Robbie 's maneuvers to escape an awkward situation in thep161store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnantagain , that old Mrs. Gill had asked after her the other day , and that he found himself very much alone since her mother 's death . And he hoped she was well . She threw the letter into the wastebasket on top of the dentist 's bill . The letter from the client in Oregon wanted to know what had happened to a manuscript sent in three months before ; the large bulky envelope contained a manuscript written in longhand , from a young man in Allentown who wanted it sold immediately and their fee taken out of the editor 's check . She glanced through the manuscript carelessly , turning over the pages and reading a few words on each ; halfway through she stopped and read a whole page , and then turned back a little and read more . With her eyes still on the manuscript , she leaned over and reached into the bottom drawer of her desk , stirring papers around until she found a small , ten-cent notebook , partly filled with notes . She opened the notebook to a blank page , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can switch that around and make it a woman instead of a man ; and she made another note , " make W. , use any name but Helen , " which was the name of the woman in the story . Then she put the notebook away and set the manuscriptto one side of her desk in order to swing up the panel of the desk that brought the typewriter upright . She took out a sheet of notepaper labeled " ROBERT SHAX , Literary Agents , Elizabeth Style , Fiction Department , " and put it into the typewriter ; she was just typing the young man 's name and the address : General Delivery , Allentown , when she heard the outer door open and close . " Hello , " she called , without looking up . " Good morning . " She looked up then ; it was such a high , girlish voice . The girl who had come in was big and blonde , and walked across the little reception room as though she were prepared to be impressed no matter what happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Elizabeth asked , her hands still resting on the typewriter keys . If God should have sent me a client , she thought , it wo n't hurt to look literary . " I wanted Mr. Shax , " the girl said . She waited in the doorwayof Elizabeth 's office . " He was called out on very pressing business , " Elizabeth said . " Did you have an appointment ? " The girl hesitated , as though doubting Elizabeth 's authority . " Not exactly , " she said finally . " I 'm supposed to be working here , I guess . " Seemed like there was something he wanted to tell me , Elizabeththought , that coward . " I see , " she said . " Come in and sit down . " The girl came in shyly , although with no apparent timidity . She figured it was his business to tell me , not hers , Elizabeth thought . " Did Mr. Shax tell you to come to work here ? " " Well , " the girl said , deciding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday about five o'clock I was asking for a job in all the offices in this building and I came here and Mr. Shax showed me around the office and he said he thought I could do the work all right . " She thought back over what she had said . " You were n't here , " she added . " I could n't have been , " Elizabeth agreed . He 's known since Monday and I find out , she thought , what is this , Wednesday ? I find out on Wednesday when she shows up for work . " I did n't ask your name . " " Daphne Hill , " the girl said meekly . Elizabeth wrote " Daphne Hill " down on her memorandum and looked at it , partly to seem as if she was coming to anp163important decision and partly to see what " Daphne Hill " looked like written down . " Mr. Shax said , " the girl began , and stopped . Her voice was high and when she was anxious she opened her small brown eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a pale blonde and curled all over the top of her head , she was clumsy and awkward , all dressed up for her first day at work . " What did Mr. Shax say ? " Elizabeth asked when the girl seemed to have subsided permanently . " He said he was n't satisfied with the girl he had now and I was to learn her job and get to do it and I was to come today because he was going to tell her yesterday that I was coming . " " Fine , " Elizabeth said . " Can you type , do you suppose ? " " I guess so , " the girl said . Elizabeth looked at the letter in the typewriter on her desk and then said , " Well , you go on outside and sit at the desk out there and if the phone rings you answer it . Read or some-thing . " " Yes , Miss Style , " the girl said . " And please close my office door , " Elizabeth said . She watched the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had wanted to say to the girl were waiting to be said : maybe she could rephrase some of them for Robbie at lunch . What does this mean , she thought suddenly in panic , Miss Wilson has been here almost as long as I have . Is he trying in his own heavy-handed fashion to beautify the office ? He might better buy a bookcase ; who is going to teach this incredible girl to answer the phone and write letters , even as well as Miss Wilson ? Me , she thought at last . I 'm going to have to drag Robbie out of this last beautiful impulsive gesture like always ; the things I do for a miserable little office and a chance top164make money . Anyway , maybe Daphne will help me paint the walls after five some day ; maybe the one thing Daphne knows how to do is paint . She turned back to the letter in the typewriter . An encouragingletter to a new client ; it fell into a simple formula in her mind and she wrote it without hesitating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dear Mr. Burton , " she wrote . " We have read your story with a good deal of interest . Your plot is well thought out , and we believe that the character of  --  " She stopped for a minute and turned back to the manuscript , openingit at random  --  " Lady Montague , in particular , is of more than usual merit . Naturally , in order to appeal to the betterpayingmarkets , the story needs touching up by a skilled professionaleditor , a decisive selling service we are able to offer our clients . Our rates  --  " " Miss Style ? " In spite of the beaverboard partitions , Elizabeth said , " If you want to talk to me , Miss Hill , come in . " After a minute Miss Hill opened the door and came in . Elizabeth could see her pocketbook on the desk outside , the lipstick and compact sitting next to it . " When does Mr. Shax get back ? " " Probably not till this afternoon . He went out on important business with a client , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No , I just wondered , " Miss Hill said . She closed the door and went heavily back to her desk . Elizabeth looked again at the letter in the typewriter and then turned her chair around to put her still-wet feet on the radiator under the window . After a minute she opened the bottom drawer of her desk again and this time took out a pocket reprint of a mystery story . With her feet on the radiator she settled down to read.  |p165Because  it was raining , and because she was depressed and out of sorts , and because Robbie had not come by quarter to one , Elizabeth treated herself to a Martini while she was waiting , sitting uncomfortably on a narrow chair in the restaurant , watching other unimpressive people go in and out . The restaurant was crowded , the floors wet from the feet coming in from the rain , and it was dark and dismal . Elizabeth and Robbie had come here for lunch two or three times a week , ever since they had opened the office in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been in summer , and Elizabeth , in a sheer black dress  --  she remembered it still ; she would be too thin for it now  --  and a small white hat and white gloves , had been excited and happy over the great new career opening out for her . She and Robbie had held hands across the table and talked enthusiastically : they were only going to stay in the old building for a year , or two at the most , and then they would have enough money to move uptown ; the good clients who would come to the new Robert Shax Agency would be honest reputable writers , with large bestsellingmanuscripts ; editors would go to lunch with them at sleek uptown restaurants , a drink before lunch would not be an extraordinary thing . The first order of stationery saying " ROBERT SHAX , Literary Agents , Elizabeth Style , Fiction Department/ ' had not been delivered ; they planned the letterheadat lunch that day . Elizabeth thought about ordering another Martini and then she saw Robbie coming impatiently through the people in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her , aware of people watching him , an executive late for a luncheon appointment , even in a dingy restaurant . When he got to the table , his back to the room , his face was tired and his voice was quiet . " Finally made it , " he said . He looked surprised at the empty Martini glass . " I have n't even had breakfast yet , " he said . " Did you have a bad time with the minister ? " " Terrible , " he said . " He wants a book of his poems publishedthis year . " " What did you tell him ? " Elizabeth tried not to let her voice sound strained . Time enough for that later , she thought , when he feels like answering me . " I do n't know , " Robbie said . " How the hell do I know what I told the old fool ? " He sat down heavily . " Something about we 'd do our best . " That means he 's really made a mess of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd tell me in detail . She was suddenly so tired that she let her shoulders droop and sat stupidly staring off at the people coming in and out of the door . What am I going to say to him , she thought , what words will Robbie understandbest ? " What are you looking so glum about ? " Robbie asked suddenly . " No one made you go way the hell uptown without breakfast . " " I had a tough morning anyway , " Elizabeth said . Robbie looked up , waiting . " I had a new employee to break in . " Robbie still waited , his face a little flushed , squinting at her ; he was waiting to see what she was going to say before he apologized , or lost his temper , or tried to pass the whole thing off as a fine joke . Elizabeth watched him : this is Robbie , she was thinking , I know what he 's going to do and what he 's going to say and what tie he 's going to wear every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have known these things and for eleven yearsp167I have been wondering how to say things to make him understand ; and eleven years ago we sat here and held hands and he said we were going to be successful . " I was thinking of the day we had lunch here when we first started out together , " she said quietly , and Robbie looked mystified . " The day we started out together , " she repeated more distinctly . " Do you remember Jim Harris ? " Robbie nodded , his mouth a little open . " We were going to make a lot of money because Jim was going to bring all his friends to us and then you had a fight with Jim and we have n't seen him since and none of his friends came to us and now we 've got your friend the minister for a client and a beautiful picture of Jim on your office wall . Signed , " she said . " Signed , with gratitude , ' and if he was making enough money we 'd be around trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Robbie said . He was confused between trying to look hurt and trying to see if anyone heard what she was saying . " Even the boy in my corner drugstore . " Elizabeth looked at him for a minute . " Daphne Hill , " she said . " My God . " " I see , " Robbie said , with a significant smile . " Daphne Hill . " He turned when he saw the waitress coming . " Miss , " he said loudly , and to Elizabeth , " I think you ought to have another drink . Cheer you up a little . " When the waitress looked at him he said " Two Martinis , " and turned back to Elizabeth , putting on the smile again . " I 'm going to drink my breakfast , " he said , and then he reached over and touched Elizabeth 's hand . " Listen , " he said , " Liz , if that 's all that 's bothering you . I was a dope , I thought you 'd figured I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daphne 's all right . I just thought we needed someone around who 'd brighten the place up a little . " " You could have painted the wall , " Elizabeth said tone- lessly . When Robbie stared she said , " Nothing , " and he went on , leaning forward seriously . " Look , " he said , " if you do n't like this Daphne out she goes . There 's no question about it , after all . We 're in business together . " He looked off into space and smiled reminiscently . " I remember those days , all right . We were going to do wonders . " He lowered his voice and looked lovingly at Elizabeth . " I think we still can , " he said . Elizabeth laughed in spite of herself . " You 'll have to go down the stairs more quietly , " she said . " My janitor 's wife thought you were the man who leaves skis out in the hall . She nearly broke a leg . " " Do n't make fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it really hurts me to see you let someone like Daphne Hill upset you . " " Of course it does , " Elizabeth said . Robbie suddenly impressedher as funny . If only I could keep on feeling like this , she thought , even while she was laughing at him . " Here comes your breakfast for you to drink , " she said . " Miss , " Robbie said to the waitress . " We 'd like to order our lunch , please . " He handed the menu ceremoniously to Elizabeth and said to the waitress , " Chicken croquettes and French fried potatoes . " Elizabeth said , " The same , please , " and handed the menu back . When the waitress had gone Robbie picked up one of the Martinis and handed it to Elizabeth . " You need this , old girl , " he said . He picked up the other and looked at her ; then he lowered his voice to the same low affectionate tone , and said , " Here 's to you , and our future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her drink . She could see Robbie debating whether to toss his off all at once or to sip it slowly as though he did n't need it.  | " If you drink it too fast you 'll be sick , dear , " she said . " Without your breakfast . " He tasted it delicately and then set it down . " Now let 's talk seriously about Daphne , " he said . " I thought she was leaving , " Elizabeth said . He looked frightened . " Naturally , if you want it that way , " he said stiffly . " Seems sort of rotten to hire a girl and fire her the same day because you 're jealous . " " I 'm not jealous , " Elizabeth said . " I never said I was . " " If I ca n't have a good-looking girl in the office , " Robbie said . " You can , " Elizabeth said . " I 'd just like one who could type . " " Daphne can take care of the work all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then stopped . Already , she thought , I do n't want to laugh at him any more ; I wish I could feel all the time like I did a minute ago , not like this . She looked at him carefully , his red face and the thin greying hair , and the heavy shoulders above the table ; he was holding his head back and his chin firm because he knew she was looking at him . He thinks I 'm awed , she thought , he 's a man and he 's cowed me . " Let her stay , " Elizabeth said . " After all , " Robbie leaned back to let the waitress put his plate in front of him , " after all , " he went on when the waitress had gone , " it is n't as though I did n't have the authority to hire someone for my own office . " " I know , " Elizabeth said wearily . " If you want to start a fuss about some small thing , " Robbie said . The corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes . " I can run my own office , " he repeated.  | " You 're scared to death I might leave you some day , " Elizabethsaid . " Eat your lunch . " Robbie picked up his fork . " Naturally , " he said , " I feel that it would be a shame to break up a pleasant partnership just because you were jealous . " " Never mind , " Elizabeth said , " I wo n't go away any-where . " " I hope not , " Robbie said . He ate industriously for a minute . " I tell you what , " he said suddenly , putting his fork down , " we 'll try her out for a week and then if you do n't think she 's better than Miss Wilson she 'll go . " " But I do n't  --  " Elizabeth began . Then she said . " Fine . That way we can find out exactly how she 'll suit us . " " Splendid idea , " Robbie said . " Now I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time patted her hand . " Good old Liz , " he said . " You know , " Elizabeth said , " I feel so funny right now . " She was looking at the doorway . " I thought I saw someone I knew . " Robbie turned around and looked at the doorway . " Who ? " " No one you know , " Elizabeth said . " A boy from my home town . It was n't the same person , though . " " Always think you see people you know in New York , " Robbie said , turning back to his fork . Elizabeth was thinking , it must have been talking about old times with Robbie and the two drinks I had , I have n't thought of Frank for years . She laughed out loud , and Robbie stopped eating to say , " What 's the matter with you , anyway ? People will think something 's wrong . " " I was just thinking , " Elizabeth said . Suddenly she felt that she must talk to Robbie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a husband almost . " I have n't thought about this fellow for years , " she said . " It just brought a thousandthings back to my mind . " " An old boy friend ? " Robbie said without interest . Elizabeth felt the same twinge of horror she might have felt fifteen years ago at the suggestion , " Oh , no , " she said . " He took me to a dance once . My mother called up his mother and asked to have him take me . " " Chocolate ice cream with chocolate sauce , " Robbie said to the waitress . " Just coffee , " Elizabeth said . " He was a wonderful boy , " she said to Robbie . Why ca n't I stop myself ? she was thinking , I have n't thought about this for years . " Listen , " Robbie said , " did you tell Daphne she could go out for lunch ? " " I did n't tell her anything , " Elizabeth said . " We better hurry then , " Robbie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Frank , Elizabeth thought . " Seriously , " she said , " what did you and the minister decide ? " " I 'll tell you later , " Robbie said , " when I get my ideas straight . Right now I 'm not so sure what we did decide . " And he 'll spring it on me suddenly , Elizabeth thought , so I wo n't have time to think ; he 's just promised to publish the minister 's poems at his own expense ; or he 's gone out of town , will I deal with it ; or someone 's going to sue us . Frank would n't have been in a place like this , anyway , if he 's eating at all , it 's some place where everything is quiet and they call him " sir " and the women are all beautiful . " It does n't matter anyway , " she said . " Of course it does n't , " Robbie said . He evidently felt it was necessary to add one final clinching touch before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can fight it together , we 'll come through everything fine , " he said . " We work well together , Liz . " He stood up and turned to get his coat and hat . His suit was wrinkled and he felt uncomfortable in it , from the way he moved his shoulders uneasily . Elizabeth finished the last of her coffee . " You get fatter every day , " she said . He looked around at her , his eyes frightened . " You think I ought to start dieting again ? " he asked . They came up in the elevator together , standing in opposite corners , each looking off into space , through the iron grillwork of the elevator , into something private and secret . They had gone up and down in this elevator four or six or eight or ten times a day since they moved into the building , sometimes happily , sometimes coldly angry with one another , sometimes laughing or quarreling furiously with quick violent phrases ; the elevator operator probably knew more about them than Elizabeth 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall from Robbie , and yet they got into the elevator daily and the elevator operator spoke to them civilly and stood with his back to them , riding up and down , entering briefly into their quarrels , possibly smiling with his back turned . Today he said , " Weather still bad ? " and Robbie said , " Worse than ever , " and the operator said , " There ought to be a law against it , " and let them off at their floor . " I wonder what he thinks of us , the elevator man , " Elizabethsaid , following Robbie down the hall . " Probably wishes he could get off that elevator for a while and sit down in an office , " Robbie said . He opened the door of the office and said , " Miss Hill ? "  |p173Da|phne  Hill was sitting at the reception desk , reading the mystery Elizabeth had left to go out to lunch . " Hello , Mr. Shax , " she said . " Did you take that off my desk ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once without thinking . " Was n't it all right ? " Daphne asked . " I did n't have anything to do . " " We 'll find you plenty to do , young lady , " Robbie said heartily , the brisk businessman again . " Sorry to keep you waiting for lunch . " " I went out and got something to eat , " Daphne said . " Good , " Robbie said , looking sideways at Elizabeth . " We 'll have to make some arrangement for the future . " " Hereafter , " Elizabeth said sharply , " do n't go into my office without permission . " " Sure , " Daphne said , startled . " You want your book back ? " " Keep it , " Elizabeth said . She went into her office and closed the door . She heard Robbie saying , " Miss Style does n't like to have her things disturbed , Miss Hill , " and then , " Come into my office , please . " As though there were real partitions , Elizabeth thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daphne pound her deliberate way after him , and the door close . She sighed , and thought , I 'll pretend they 're real partitions ; Robbie will . She noticed a note standing against her typewriterwhere she had left it with the letter to Mr. Burton still half-finished . She picked up the note and read it with heavy concentration to drown out Robbie 's employer voice on the other side of the partition . The note was from Miss Wilson , and said : " Miss Style , no one told me there was a new girl coming and since I 've been working here so long I think you should have told me . I guess she can learn the work as well by herself . Please tell Mr. Shax to send me my money at home , the address is in the file as he knows . There was a call from a Mr. Robert Hunt for you , will you call him back at his hotel , the Addison House . Please tell Mr. Shax to send the money , it comes now to two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She must have been mad , Elizabeth thought , not to wait around for her money , she must have been furious , I guess Daphne was the first to tell her and she felt like I did ; he 'll never send her any money . She could hear Robbie 's voice saying , " It 's a terrible business , the most heart-breaking I know . " He 's talking about free-lance writing , she thought , Daphne probably wants to sell her life history . She went out of the door of her office and around to Robbie'sand knocked . If Robbie says , " Who is it ? " she thought , I 'll say " The elevator man , come up to sit down for a while . " Then Robbie said , " Come on in , Liz , do n't be silly . " " Robbie , " she said , opening the door , " Miss Wilson was here and left a note . " " I forgot to tell you , " Daphne said , " and I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Shax to send her money . " " I 'm sorry about this , " Robbie said . " She should have been told yesterday . It 's a damned shame for her to find out like this . " Daphne was sitting in the one other chair in his office and he hesitated and then said , " Sit here , Elizabeth . " Elizabeth waited until he started to hoist himself up and then said , " That 's all right , Robbie , I 'm going back to work . " Robbie read Miss Wilson 's letter carefully . " Miss Hill , " he said , " make a note to send Miss Wilson her back pay and the extra week she asks for . "  | " I do n't have anything to make a note on , " Daphne said . Elizabeth took a pad and pencil off Robbie 's desk and handed it to her , and Daphne made a solemn sentence on the first page of the pad . " Who is this Hunt ? " Robbie asked Elizabeth . " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have told him , Elizabeth thought . " I think it 's an old friend of my father 's from home , " she said . " Better call him back , " Robbie said , handing her the note . " I shall , " Elizabeth said . " Do n't you think you 'd better write Miss Wilson and explain what happened ? " Robbie looked dismayed , and then he said , " Miss Hill can do that this afternoon . " Elizabeth , carefully not looking at Daphne , said , " Fine idea . That will give her something to do . " She closed the door quietly when she went out and closed the door of her own office after herself to give the illusion of privacy . She knew that Robbie would listen to her talking on the phone ; she had an odd picture of Robbie and Daphne , sitting silently one on either side of Robbie 's desk , two heavy serious faces turned slightly to the partition , listening soberly to Elizabeth talking to her father 's old friend . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robbie say , " Tell her we 're all sincerely sorry , but that circumstances beyond my control , and so on . Make it as pleasant as possible . Remember to tell her we 'll consider her for the first new job we have here . " Elizabeth dialed the number , waiting for the sudden silence in Robbie 's office . She asked the hotel clerk for Mr. Robert Hunt , and when he answered she made her voice low , and said , " Uncle Robert ? This is Beth . "  |p176He  answered enthusiastically , " Beth ! It 's fine hearing your voice . Mom thought you 'd be too busy to call back . " " Is she with you ? How nice , " Elizabeth said . " How are you both ? How is Dad ? " " All fine , " he said . " How are you , Beth ? " She kept her voice low . " Just grand , Uncle Robert , getting along so well . How long have you been here ? And how long are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He laughed . " Mom is talking at me from this end and you 're talking at me from that end , " he said . " And I ca n't hear a word either of you is saying . How are you , anyway ? " " I 'm grand , " she said again . " Beth , " he said , " we 're very anxious to see you . Got a lot of messages from home and all . " " I 'm pretty busy , " she said , " but I 'd love to see you . How long are you staying ? " " Tomorrow , " he said . " Just came in for a couple of days . " She was figuring quickly , even while her voice was saying , " Oh , no , " with heavy dismay . " ' Why did n't you let me know ? " she said . " Mom wants me to tell you everyone sends their love , " he said . " I 'm just sick , " she said . Guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know how I 'm going to get to see you . Maybe tomorrow morning somehow ? " " Well , " he said slowly , " Mom sort of had her heart set on going to Long Island tomorrow to see her sister , and they 'll take us right to the train . We thought maybe you 'd come along with us tonight . " " Oh , Lord , " Elizabeth said , " I 've got a dinner appointment I ca n't break . A client , " she said , " you know . " " Is n't that a shame , " he said . " We 're going to a show ;  |p177thought  you might come along . Mom , " he called , " what 's that show we 're going to ? " He waited for a minute and then said , " She does n't remember either . The hotel got tickets for us . " " I wish I could , " she said , " I just wish I could . " She thought in spite of herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the two old people alone for dinner pretending they were celebrating in a strange city . They saved tonight for me , she thought . " If it had been any other person in the world , I could have broken it , but this is one of our best clients and I just do n't dare . " " Of course not . " There was so long a silence that Elizabeth said hastily , " How is Dad , anyway ? " " Fine , " he said . " Everyone 's fine . I guess he sort of wishes you were home now . " " I imagine he 's lonesome , " Elizabeth said , careful not to let her voice commit her to anything . She was anxious to end the phone call , dissociate herself from the Hunts and her father and the nagging hints that she should go home . I live in New York now , she told herself while the old man 's voice continued with a monotonous series of anecdotes about her father and people she had known long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to remember any of these people ; Uncle Robert should be glad I talk to him at all . " I 'm so glad you called , " she said suddenly , through his voice . " I 've got to get back to work . " " Of course , " he said apologetically . " Well , Beth , write to all of us , wo n't you ? Mom is telling me to give you her love . " They hang on to me , she thought ; they 're holding me back , with their letters and their " Yrs . afftly. , " and their sending love back and forth . " Good-bye , " she said . " Come back soon for a visit , " he went on . " I will when I can . Good-bye , " Elizabeth said . She hung up on his " Good-bye , " and then , " Oh , wait , Beth , " when something more occurred to him . I could n't listen any longer withoutbeing rude , she thought . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " And I guess you understand about things like answering the phone , and so on . " " I guess so , " Daphne said . Elizabeth went back to her letter to Mr. Burton , permanentlycurled from staying in the typewriter , and she heard Robbie and Daphne Hill talking for a while , about names of clients , and the two-button phone extension at the reception desk , and then she heard both of them go out to the reception desk and try the extension , two children , she thought , playing office . Occasionally she would hear Robbie 's heavy laugh , and then , after a minute , Daphne laughing too , slow and surprised . In spite of all her attempts to concentrate on their rates for Mr. Burton she found herself listening , following Robbie and Daphne where they moved around the office . Once , louder than the slight murmur which had been going on between them , she heard Robbie 's man-of-the-world voice saying , " Some quiet little restaurant , " and then when the voice dropped back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can talk . She waited , not to sound like an intruder , until she heard Daphne settle down solidly at the reception desk and Robbie start back for his own office . Then she said , " Robbie ? " There was a silence and then he came around and opened her office door . " You know I do n't like you to yell in the office , " he said . She paused for a minute because she wanted to speak cordially . " We 're going to have dinner together tonight ? " shep179asked . They had dinner together four or five times a week , usually in the restaurant where they had had lunch , or in some small place near either Robbie 's apartment or Elizabeth 's . When she saw the corners of Robbie 's mouth turn down and the faint turn of his head toward the outer office she raised her voice slightly . " I got out of seeing these fool people tonight , " she said . " There 's a lot I want to talk to you about . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robbie said , talking very quickly and in a low voice , " I 'm afraid I 'm going to be stuck for dinner . " Not realizing that he was repeating what he had heard her say on the phone a few minutes before , he went on , putting on a look of annoyance , " I 've got a dinner appointment I ca n't break , with a client . " When Elizabeth looked surprised , he said , " The minister , I promised him this morning we 'd get togetheragain tonight . I have n't had a chance to tell you . " " Of course you ca n't break it , " Elizabeth said easily . She waited , watching Robbie . He was sitting uneasily on the corner of her desk , playing absently with a pencil , wanting to leave and afraid to go too abruptly . What am I doing , Elizabeththought suddenly , playing hide-and-seek ? " Why do n't you go to a movie or something ? " she said . Robbie laughed mournfully . " I wish I could , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencil away from him . " Poor old Robbie , " she said . " You 're all upset . You ought to get off somewhere and relax . " Robbie frowned anxiously . " Why should I ? " he said . " Is n't this my office ? " Elizabeth made her voice tender . " You ought to get out of here for a few hours , Robbie , I 'm serious . You wo n't be able to work this afternoon . " She decided to allow herself one small spiteful dig . " Particularly if you have to see that old horror tonight , " she said.  | Robbie 's mouth opened and closed , and then he said , " I ca n't think when it 's such lousy weather . Rain drives me crazy . " " I know it does , " Elizabeth said . She stood up . " You get your hat and coat on , and leave your brief case and everything here , " she said , pushing him toward the door , " and then come back after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll feel like a million dollars to go out and out-talk the minister . " " I do n't want to go out again in this weather , " Robbie said . " Stop and get a shave , " Elizabeth said . She opened the door of her office and saw Daphne Hill staring at her . " Get a haircut , " she said , touching the back of his head . " Miss Hill and I will get along fine without you . Wo n't we , Miss Hill ? " " Sure , " Daphne said . Robbie went uneasily into his office and came out a minute later carrying his wet coat and hat . " I do n't know what you want me to go out for , " he said . " I do n't know what you want to stay here for , " Elizabeth said , escorting him to the outer door . " You 're not good for anything when you feel like this . " She opened the front door and he walked out . " See you later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , starting down the hall . Elizabeth watched him until he had gone into the elevator and then she closed the door behind her and turned to Daphne Hill . " Is that letter to Miss Wilson anywhere near written ? " she asked . " I was just doing it , " Daphne said . " Bring it to me when you finish . " Elizabeth went into her office and closed the door and sat down at the desk . Frank , she was thinking , it could n't have been Frank . He would have said " Hello " or something , I have n't changed that much . If it was Frank , what was he doing around here ? It wo n't do any good , she thought , there 's no way of finding him anyway.  |p181She  took the telephone book from the corner of her desk and looked for Frank 's name ; it was n't there , and she turned further until she came to the H 's , running her finger down the page till she found Harris , James . Pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When a man answered she said , " Is this Jim Harris ? " " That 's right , " he said . " This is Elizabeth Style . " " Hello , " he said . " How are you ? " " I 've been waiting for you to get in touch with me , " she said . " It 's been a long time . " " I know it has , " he said . " Somehow I never seem to get around  --  " " I 'll tell you what I called you about , " she said . " Do you remember Frank Davis ? " " I remember him , " he said . " What 's he doing now ? " " That 's what I wanted to ask you , " she said . " Oh . Well .... " She waited a minute , and then went on , " One of these days I 'm going to take you up on that standing dinner date . " " I hope you do , " he said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . " It seems like such a long time since we got together . Listen . " She made her voice sound like this was a sudden idea , one of those unexpectedly brilliant things , " Why do n't we make it tonight ? " He started to say something and she went on , " I 've been dying to see you . " " You see , my kid sister 's in town , " he said . " Ca n't she come along ? " Elizabeth asked . " Well , " he said , " I guess so . " " Fine , " Elizabeth said . " You come on down to my place for a drink first , and bring the kid along , and we can have a grand talk about old times . "  | " Suppose I call you back ? " he asked . " I 'm leaving the office now , " Elizabeth said flatly . " I 'll be running around all afternoon . So let 's make it around seven ? " " All right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it tonight , " Elizabeth said . " I 'll see you later . " After she had hung up she sat for a minute with her hand on the phone , thinking , good old Harris , he never has a chance if you talk fast ; he must get stuck for every dirty job around town . She laughed , pleased , and then stopped abruptly when Daphne knocked on the door ; when Elizabeth said , " Come in , " Daphne opened the door cautiously and put her head in . " I finished the letter , Miss Style , " she said . " Bring it here , " Elizabeth said , and then added , " please . " Daphne came in and held the letter out at arm 's length . " Itis n't very good , " she said . " But it 's my first letter by myself . " Elizabeth glanced at the letter . " It does n't matter , " she said . " Sit down , Daphne . " Daphne sat down gingerly on the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's the only chair I 've got and I do n't want you breaking it . " Daphne sat back and opened her eyes wide . Elizabeth carefully opened her pocketbook and took out a pack of cigarettes and hunted for a match . " Just a minute , " Daphne said eagerly , " I 've got some . " She hurried out to the outer office and came back with a package of matches . " Keep them , " she said , " I 've got plenty more . " Elizabeth lit her cigarette and put the matches down on the edge of the desk . " Now , " she said , and Daphne leaned forward . " Where did you work before you started here ? " " This is my first job , " Daphne said . " I just came to New York . "  | " Where did you come from ? " " Buffalo , " Daphne said . " So you came to New York to make your fortune ? " Elizabethasked . This is where I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made my fortune . " I do n't know , " Daphne said . " My father brought us down here because his brother needed him in the business . We just moved here a couple of months ago . " If I had a family to take care of me , Elizabeth thought , I would n't have a job with Robert Shax . " What sort of an educationhave you had ? " " I went to high school in Buffalo , " Daphne said . " I was in business school for a while . " " You want to be a writer ? " " No , " Daphne said , " I want to be an agent , like Mr. Shax . And you , " she added . " It 's a fine business , " Elizabeth said . " You can make a lot of money at it . " " That 's what Mr. Shax said . He was very nice about it . " Daphne was getting braver . She was eyeing Elizabeth 's cigarette and had settled down comfortably in her chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport in Daphne . " Mr. Shax and I were talking about you at lunch , " she said deliberately . Daphne smiled . When she smiled , and when she was sitting down , without the appearance of that big body resting precariouslyon small feet , Daphne was an attractive girl . In spite of the small brown eyes , with that incredible mop of hair , Daphne was very attractive . I 'm so thin , Elizabeth thought , and she said with pleasure , " I think you 'd better rewrite that letter to Miss Wilson , Daphne . " " Sure , " Daphne said.  | " Telling her , " Elizabeth went on , " to come back to work as soon as she can . " " Back here ? " Daphne asked , with the smallest beginning of alarm . " Back here , " Elizabeth said . She smiled . " I 'm afraid Mr. Shax did n't have courage enough to tell you , " she said . " Mr. Shax and I are , besides business partners , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of our friendship and leaves the disagreeable tasks for me to do . " " Mr. Shax did n't tell me anything , " Daphne said . " I did n't think he had , " Elizabeth said , " when I saw how you went right ahead as though you were staying here . " Daphne was frightened . She 's too stupid to cry , Elizabeth thought , but she 's going to have to have everything explained to her in detail . " Naturally , " Elizabeth went on , " I do n't like having to do this . Possibly I can make it easier for you by trying to help you get another job . " Daphne nodded . " This may help you , " Elizabeth said , " because Mr. Shax commented on it earlier , and it 's the sort of thing men are particular about . Your appearance . " Daphne looked down at the ample front of her dress . " Probably , " Elizabeth said , " you already know this , and I 'm very rude to comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betterimpression and if you ever get a job you 'd be able to work more comfortably if you wore something to the office instead of a silk dress . It makes you seem , somehow , as though you were just in from Buffalo . " " You want me to wear a suit or something ? " Daphne asked . She spoke slowly and without malice . " Something quieter , anyway , " Elizabeth said.  |p185Da|phne  looked Elizabeth up and down . " A suit like yours ? " she asked . " A suit would be fine , " Elizabeth said . " And try to comb your hair down . " Daphne touched the top of her head tenderly . " Try to be more orderly , in general , " Elizabeth said . " You have beautiful hair , Daphne , but it would look more suitable to an office if you were to wear it more severely . " " Like yours ? " Daphne asked , looking at the grey in Elizabeth'shair . " Any way you please , " Elizabeth said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She turned pointedly back to her desk , and after a minute Daphne rose . " Take this back , " Elizabeth said , holding out the letter to Miss Wilson , " and rewrite it the way I told you to . " " Yes , Miss Style , " Daphne said . " You can go home as soon as you 're through with the letter , " Elizabeth said . " Leave it on your desk , along with your name and address , and Mr. Shax will send you your day 's pay . " I do n't care whether he does or not , " Daphne said abruptly . Elizabeth looked up for a minute and regarded Daphne steadily . " Do you think you have any right to criticize Mr. Shax 's decisions ? " she asked . For a few minutes Elizabeth sat at her desk waiting to see what Daphne would do ; after the door had closed quietly behind Daphne and she had walked to her desk there had been a heavy silence ; she 's sitting at her desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finally , there was the small sound of Daphne 's pocketbook , the snap of the catch opening ,  | the movement of a hand searching against keys , papers ; she 's taking her compact out , Elizabeth thought , she 's looking to see if what I said about her appearance is true ; she 's wondering if Robbie said anything , how he said it , whether I made it worse or smoothed it over for her . I should have told her he said she was a fat pig , or the ugliest thing he had ever seen ; she might not even have seen through that . What 's she doing now ? Daphne had said " Damn " very distinctly ; Elizabeth sat forward in her chair , not wanting to let any trace of action escape . Then there was the quiet sound of the typewriter ; Daphne was typing the letter to Miss Wilson . Elizabeth shook her head slowly and laughed . She lighted a cigarette with one of Daphne 's matches , still on the edge of the desk , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the typewriter . Sittingwith one arm hooked over the back of the chair and the cigarette in her mouth , she typed slowly , with one finger , " The hell with you , Burton , " and then tore the page out of the typewriter and threw it in the wastebasket . That 's every single bit of work I 've done today , she told herself , and it does n't matter after looking at Daphne 's face when I told her . She looked at her desk , the letters waiting to be answered , the criticisms by a professional editor waiting to be written , the complaints to be satisfied , and thought , I 'll go on home . I can take a bath and clean the place and get some stuff for Jim and the kid sister ; I 'll only wait till Daphne leaves . " Daphne ? " she called . After a hesitation : " Yes , Miss Style ? " " Are n't you through yet ? " Elizabeth said ; she could afford to let herself speak gently now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute . " " Just getting ready to leave , " Daphne said.  | " Do n't forget to leave your name and address . " There was a silence from the other room , and Elizabeth said to her closed door , raising her voice again , " Did you hear me ? " " Mr. Shax knows my name and address , " Daphne said . The outer door opened , and Daphne said , " Good-bye . " " Good-bye , " Elizabeth said . She got out of the taxi at her corner , and after paying the man , she had a ten-dollar bill and some change in her pocketbook ; this , with twenty dollars more in her apartment , was all the money she had until she could ask Robbie for more . Figuring quickly , she decided to take ten dollars of her money at home to get her through the evening ; Jim Harris would have to pay for her dinner ; ten dollars , then , for taxis and emergencies ; she would ask Robbie for more tomorrow . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things ; she stopped in the liquor store on the corner and bought a bottle of rye , a fifth , so that she would have some to offer Robbie the next time he came down . With her bottle under her arm she went into the delicatessen and bought ginger ale ; hesitantly she selected a bag of potato chips and then a box of crackers and a liverwurst spread to put on them . She was unused to entertaining ; she and Robbie spent eveningsquietly together , seldom seeing any people except an occasional client and , sometimes , an old friend who invited them out . Because they were not married , Robbie was reluctant to take her anywhere where he might be embarrassed by her presence . They ate their meals in small restaurants , did their rare drinking at home or in a corner bar , saw neighborhoodmovies . When it was necessary for Elizabeth to invite people to visit her Robbie was not there ; they had once given a party in Robbie 's larger apartment to celebrate some great occasion , probably a client of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the guest so uncomfortable that they had never given another and had been invited to only one or two . Consequently Elizabeth , although she spoke so blithely of " coming down for a drink , " was almost completely at a loss when people actually came . As she climbed the stairs to her apartment , her packages braced between her arm and her chin , she was worrying over and over the progress of having a drink , the passing of crackers , the taking of coats . The appearance of her room shocked her ; she had forgotten her hurried departure this morning and the way she had left things around ; also , the apartment was created and planned for Elizabeth ; that is , the hurried departure every morning of a rather unhappy and desperate young woman with little or no ability to make things gracious , the lonely ugly eveningsin one chair with one book and one ashtray , the nights spent dreaming of hot grass and heavy sunlight . There was no possible arrangement of these things that would permit of a casual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a room holding glasses , talking lightly . In the early evening , with one lamp on and the shadows in the corners , it looked warm and soft , but you had only to sit down in the one armchair , or touch a hand to the grey wood end table that looked polished , to see that the armchair was hard and cheap , the grey paint chipping . For a minute Elizabeth stood in the doorway holding her packages , trying clearly to visualize her room as it might be smoothed out by an affectionate hand , but the noise of footstepsabove coming down the stairs drove her inside with the door shut and , once in , there was no clear vision ; shep189had her feet on the unpolished floor ; there was a dirty fingerprinton the inside doorknob . Robbie 's , Elizabeth thought . She opened the glass French doors that screened the kitchenetteand put her packages down ; the kitchenette was part of one wall , with a tiny stove built in under a cabinet , a sink installed over a refrigerator , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her collection of china : two plates , two cups and saucers , four glasses . She also owned a small saucepan , a frying-pan , and a coffeepot . She had bought all her small house furnishings in a five-and-ten a few years before , planninga tiny complete kitchen , where she could make miniature roasts for herself and Robbie , even bake a small pie or cookies , wearing a yellow apron and making funny mistakes at first . Although she had been a fairly competent cook when she first came to New York , capable of frying chops and potatoes , in the many years since she had been near a real stove she had lost all her knowledge except the fudge-making play in which she indulged herself occasionally . Cooking was , like everything else she had known , a decent honest knowledge meant to make her a capable happy woman ( " the way to a man 's heart , " her mother used to say soberly ) , which , with the rest of her daily life , had sunk to a miniature useful only as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the four glasses and wash them ; they were dusty from standing so long unused on the open shelf . She checked the refrigerator . For a while she had kept butter and eggs in the refrigerator , and bread and coffee in the cabinet , but they had grown mouldy and rancid before she had been able to make more than one breakfast from them ; she was so often late and so seldom inclined to take time over her own breakfast . It was only four-thirty ; she had time to straighten thingsp190up and bathe and dress . Her first care was for the easy things in the apartment ; she dusted the tables and emptied the ashtray , stopping to put her dustcloth down and pull the bedcoverseven , smoothing the spread down to a regular roundness . She was tempted to take up the three small scatter rugs and shake them , and then wash the floor , but a glance at the bathroom discouraged her ; they would certainly be in and out of the bathroom , and the floor and tub and even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soaked in hot water from the tap , getting the floor clean at last ; she put out clean towels from her small stock and started her bath water while she went back to finish the big room . After all her haphazard work the room looked the same ; still grey and inhospitable in the rainy afternoon light . She debated for a minute running downstairs for some bright flowers , and then decided that her money would n't last that far ; they would only be in the room for a short while anyway , and with something to drink and something to eat any room should look friendly . When she finished her bath it was nearly six , and dark enough to light the lamp on the end table . She walked barefootacross the room , feeling clean and freshened , conscious of the cologne she had put on , with her hair curling a little from the hot water . With the feeling of cleanness came an excitement ; she would be happy tonight , she would be successful , something wonderful would happen to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dark red silk dress from the closet ; it was youthfully styled and without the grey in her hair it made her look nearer twenty than over thirty . She selected a heavy gold chain to wear with it , and thought , I can wear my good black coat , even if it 's raining I 'll wear it to feel nice.  |p191While  she dressed she thought about her home . Considered honestly , there was no way to do anything with this apartment , no yellow drapes or pictures would help . She needed a new apartment , a pleasant open place with big windows and pale furniture , with the sun coming in all day . To get a new apartment she needed more money , she needed a new job , and Jim Harris would have to help her ; tonight would be only the first of many exciting dinners together , building into a lovely friendship that would get her a job and a sunny apartment ; while she was planning her new life she forgot Jim Harris , his heavy face , his thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man with knowing eyes who watched her across a room , he was someone who loved her , he was a quiet troubledman who needed sunlight , a warm garden , green lawns . . . .  |p193MRS  . CONCORD and her older daughter , Helen , were sitting in their living-room , sewing and talking and trying to keep warm . Helen had just put down the stockings she had been mending and walked over to the French doors that opened out on to the garden . " I wish spring would hurry up and get here , " she was saying when the doorbell rang . " Good Lord , " Mrs. Concord said , " if that 's company ! The rug 's all covered with loose threads . " She leaned over in her chair and began to gather up the odds and ends of material around her as Helen went to answer the door . She opened it and stood smiling while the woman outside held out a hand and began to talk rapidly . " You 're Helen ? I 'm Mrs. Friedman , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just breaking in on you , but I have been so anxious to meet you and your mother . " " How do you do ? " Helen said . " Wo n't you come in ? " She opened the door wider and Mrs. Friedman stepped in . She was small and dark and wearing a very smart leopard coat . " Is your mother home ? " she asked Helen just as Mrs. Concordcame out of the living room . " I 'm Mrs. Concord , " Helen 's mother said . " I 'm Mrs. Friedman , " Mrs. Friedman said . " Bob Friedman 's mother . " " Bob Friedman , " Mrs. Concord repeated . Mrs. Friedman smiled apologetically . " I thought surely your boy would have mentioned Bobby , " she said . " Of course he has , " Helen said suddenly . " He 's the one  | Charlie 's always writing about , Mother . It 's so hard to make a connection , " she said to Mrs. Friedman , " because Charlie seems so far away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " Wo n't you come in and sit down ? " Mrs. Friedman followed the Concords into the living-room and sat in one of the chairs not filled with sewing . Mrs. Concordwaved her hand at the room . " It makes such a mess , " she said , " but every now and then Helen and I just get to work and make things . These are kitchen curtains , " she added , picking up the material she had been working on . " They 're very nice , " Mrs. Friedman said politely . " Well , tell us about your son , " Mrs. Concord went on . " I 'm amazed that I did n't recognize the name right away , but somehow I associate Bob Friedman with Charles and the Army , and it seemed strange to have his mother here in town . " Mrs. Friedman laughed . " That 's just about the way I felt , " she said . " Bobby wrote me that his friend 's mother lived here only a few blocks from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and say Hello . " " I 'm so glad you did , " Mrs. Concord said . " I guess we know about as much about Bob as you do by now , " Helen said . " Charlie 's always writing about him . " Mrs. Friedman opened her purse . " I even have a letter from Charlie , " she said . " I thought you 'd like to take a look at it . " " Charles wrote you ? " Mrs. Concord asked . " Just a note . He likes the pipe tobacco I send Bobby , " Mrs. Friedman explained , " and I put a tin of it in for him the last time I sent Bobby a package . " She handed the letter to Mrs. Concord and said to Helen , " I imagine I could tell you all about yourselves , Bobby 's said so much about all of you . " " Well , " Helen said , " I know that Bob got you a Japanesep195sword for Christmas . That must have looked lovely under the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it  --  did you hear about that , and how they almost had a fight with the boy ? " " Bobby almost had a fight , " Mrs. Friedman said . " Charlie was smart and stayed out of it . " " No , we heard it that Charlie was the one who got in trouble , " Helen said . She and Mrs. Friedman laughed . " Maybe we should n't compare notes , " Mrs. Friedman said . " They do n't seem to stick together on their stories . " She turned to Mrs. Concord , who had finished the letter and handed it to Helen . " I was just telling your daughter how many complimentary things I 've heard about you . " " We 've heard a lot about you , too , " Mrs. Concord said . " Charlie showed Bob a picture of you and your two daughters . The younger one 's Nancy , is n't it ? " " Nancy , yes , " Mrs. Concord said . " Well , Charlie certainly thinks a lot of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he nice to write me ? " she asked Helen . " That tobacco must be good , " Helen said . She hesitated for a minute and handed the letter back to Mrs. Friedman , who put it in her purse . " I 'd love to meet Charlie sometime , " Mrs. Friedman said . " It seems as though I know him so well . " " I 'm sure he 'll want to meet you when he comes back , " Mrs. Concord said . " I hope it wo n't be long now , " Mrs. Friedman said . All three were silent for a minute , and then Mrs. Friedman went on with animation , " It seems so strange that we 've been living in the same town and it took our boys so far away to introduceus. "  | " This is a very hard town to get acquainted in , " Mrs. Concordsaid . " Have you lived here long ? " Mrs. Friedman smiled apologetically . " Of course I know of your husband , " she added . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they speak so highly of him . " " Really ? " Mrs. Concord said . " My husband has lived here all his life . I came here from the West when I was married . " " Then it has n't been hard for you to get settled and make friends , " Mrs. Friedman said . " No , I never had much trouble , " Mrs. Concord said . " Of course most of our friends are people who went to school with my husband . " " I 'm sorry Bobby never got a chance to study under Mr. Concord , " Mrs. Friedman said . " Well . . . . " She rose . " I have certainly enjoyed meeting you at last . " " I 'm so glad you came over , " Mrs. Concord said . " It 's like having a letter from Charles . " " And I know how welcome a letter can be , the way I wait for Bobby 's , " Mrs. Friedman said . She and Mrs. Concord started for the door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very much interested in Charlie , you know . Ever since he found out that Charlie was studying law when he went into the Army . " " Your husband is a lawyer ? " Mrs. Concord asked . " He 's the Friedman of Grunewald , Friedman &; White , " Mrs. Friedman said . " When Charlie is ready to start out for himself , perhaps my husband could find a place for him . " " That 's awfully kind of you , " Mrs. Concord said . " Charles will be so sorry when I tell him . You see , it 's always been sort of arranged that he 'd go in with Charles Satterthwaite , my husband 's oldest friend . Satterthwaite &; Harris . "  | " I believe Mr. Friedman knows the firm , " Mrs. Friedman said . " A fine old firm , " Mrs. Concord said . " Mr. Concord 's grandfather used to be a partner . " " Give Bob our best regards when you write him , " Helen said . " I will , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about meeting you . It 's been very nice , " she said , holding out her hand to Mrs. Concord . " I 've enjoyed it , " Mrs. Concord said . " Tell Charlie I 'll send him some more tobacco , " Mrs. Friedmansaid to Helen . " I certainly will , " Helen said . " Well , good-bye then , " Mrs. Friedman said . " Good-bye , " Mrs. Concord said.  |p199IT  WAS a respectable , well-padded restaurant with a good chef and a group of entertainers who called themselves a floor show ; the people who came there laughed quietly and dined thoroughly , appreciating the principle that the check was always a little more than the restaurant and the entertainment and the company warranted ; it was a respectable , likable restaurant , and two women could go into it alone with perfect decorum and have a faintly exciting dinner . When Mrs. Wilkinsand Mrs. Straw came noiselessly down the carpeted staircaseinto the restaurant none of the waiters looked up more than once , quickly , few of the guests turned , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and the few vacant tables far in the back . " Do you mind being so far away from everything , Alice ? " Mrs. Wilkins , who was hostess , said to Mrs. Straw . " We can wait for a table , if you like . Or go somewhere else ? " " Of course not . " Mrs. Straw was a rather large woman in a heavy flowered hat , and she looked affectionately at the substantialdinners set on near-by tables . " I do n't mind where we sit ; this is really lovely . " " Anywhere will do , " Mrs. Wilkins said to the headwaiter . " Not too far back if you can help it . " The headwaiter listened carefully and nodded , stepping delicatelyoff between the tables to one very far back , near the doorway where the entertainers came in and out , near the table where the lady who owned the restaurant was sitting drinking beer , near the kitchen doors . " Nothing nearer ? " Mrs. Wilkins said , frowning at the headwaiter . The headwaiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was behind a post , another was set for a large party , a third was somehow behind the small orchestra . " This will do beautifully , Jen , " Mrs. Straw said . " We 'll sit right down . " Mrs. Wilkins hesitated still , but Mrs. Straw pulled out the chair on one side of the table and sat down with a sigh , settingher gloves and pocketbook on the extra chair beside her , and reaching to unfasten the collar of her coat . " I ca n't say I like this , " Mrs. Wilkins said , sliding into the chair opposite . " I 'm not sure we can see anything . " " Of course we can , " Mrs. Straw said . " We can see all that 's going on , and of course we 'll be able to hear everything . Would you like to sit here instead ? " she finished reluctantly . " Of course not , Alice , " Mrs. Wilkins said . She accepted the menu the waiter was offering her and set it down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite good here , " she said . " Shrimp casserole , " Mrs. Straw said . " Fried chicken . " She sighed . " I certainly am hungry . " Mrs. Wilkins ordered quickly , with no debate , and then helped Mrs. Straw choose . When the waiter had gone Mrs. Straw leaned back comfortably and turned in her chair to see all of the restaurant . " This is a lovely place , " she said . " The people seem to be very nice , " Mrs. Wilkins said . " The woman who owns it is sitting over there , in back of you . I 've always thought she looked very clean and decent . " " She probably makes sure the glasses are washed , " Mrs. Straw said . She turned back to the table and picked up her pocketbook , diving deep into it after a pack of cigarettes andp201a box of wooden safety matches , which she set on the table . " I like to see a place that serves food kept nice and clean , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this place , " Mrs. Wilkins said . " Tom and I used to come here years ago before they enlarged it . It was very nice then , but it attracts a better class of people now . " Mrs. Straw regarded the crabmeat cocktail now in frontof her with deep satisfaction . " Yes , indeed , " she said . Mrs. Wilkins picked up her fork indifferently , watchingMrs . Straw . " I had a letter from Walter yesterday , " she said . " What 'd he have to say ? " Mrs. Straw asked . " He seems fine , " Mrs. Wilkins said . " Seems like there 's a lot he does n't tell us . " " Walter 's a good boy , " Mrs. Straw said . " You worry too much . " The orchestra began to play suddenly and violently and the lights darkened to a spotlight on the stage . " I hate to eat in the dark , " Mrs. Wilkins said . " We 'll get plenty of light back here from those doors , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to watch the orchestra . " They 've made Walter a proctor , " Mrs. Wilkins said . " He 'll be first in his class , " Mrs. Straw said . " Look at the dress on that girl . " Mrs. Wilkins turned covertly , looking at the girl Mrs. Straw had indicated with her head . The girl had come out of the doorway that led to the entertainers ' rooms ; she was tall and very dark , with heavy black hair and thick eyebrows , and the dress was electric green satin , cut very low , with a flaming orange flower on one shoulder . " I never did see a dress like that , " Mrs. Wilkins said . " She must be going to dance or something . " " She 's not a very pretty girl , " Mrs. Straw said . " And look at the fellow with her ! " Mrs. Wilkins turned again , and moved her head back quickly to smile at Mrs. Straw . " He looks like a monkey , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate those flabby little blond men . " " They used to have such a nice floor show here , " Mrs. Wilkinssaid . " Music , and dancers , and sometimes a nice young man who would sing requests from the audience . Once they had an organist , I think . " " This is our dinner coming along now , " Mrs. Straw said . The music had faded down , and the leader of the orchestra , who acted as master of ceremonies , introduced the first number , a pair of ballroom dancers . When the applause started , a tall young man and a tall young woman came out of the entertainers ' door and made their way through the tables to the dance floor ; on their way they both gave a nod of recognitionto the girl in electric green and the man with her . " Are n't they graceful ? " Mrs. Wilkins said when the dance started . " They always look so pretty , that kind of dancers . " " They have to watch their weight , " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl in green . " Mrs. Wilkins turned again . " I hope they 're not comedians . " " They do n't look very funny right now , " Mrs. Straw said . She estimated the butter left on her plate . " Every time I eat a good dinner , " she said , " I think of Walter and the food we used to get in school . " " Walter writes that the food is quite good , " Mrs. Wilkins said . " He 's gained something like three pounds . "  |p203Mrs  . Straw raised her eyes . " For heaven 's sake ! " " What is it ? " " I think he 's a ventriloquist , " Mrs. Straw said . " I do believe he is . " " They 're very popular right now , " Mrs. Wilkins said . " I have n't seen one since I was a kid , " Mrs. Straw said . " He 's got a little man  --  what do you call them ?  --  in that box there . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Look at it , Jen . " The girl in green and the man had sat down at a table near the entertainers ' door . She was leaning forward , watching the dummy , which was sitting on the man 's lap . It was a grotesque wooden copy of the man  --  where he was blond , the dummy was extravagantly yellow-haired , with sleek wooden curls and sideburns ; where the man was small and ugly , the dummy was smaller and uglier , with the same wide mouth , the same staring eyes , the horrible parody of evening clothes , complete to tiny black shoes . " I wonder how they happen to have a ventriloquist here , " Mrs. Wilkins said . The girl in green was leaning across the table to the dummy , straightening his tie , fastening one shoe , smoothing the shouldersof his coat . As she leaned back again the man spoke to her and she shrugged indifferently . " I ca n't take my eyes off that green dress , " Mrs. Straw said . She started as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waiting uneasily for their dessert orders , his eye on the stage where the orchestra was finishing a between-acts number . By the time Mrs. Straw had decided on apple pie with chocolate ice cream the master of ceremonies was introducing the ventriloquist " . . . and Marmaduke , a chip off the old block ! "  | " I hope it 's not very long , " Mrs. Wilkins said . " We ca n't hear from here anyway . " The ventriloquist and the dummy were sitting in the spotlight , both grinning widely , talking fast ; the man 's weak blond face was close to the dummy 's staring grin , their black shouldersagainst one another . Their conversation was rapid ; the audience was laughing affectionately , knowing most of the jokes before the dummy finished speaking , silent with interest for a minute and then laughing again before the words were out . " I think he 's terrible , " Mrs. Wilkins said to Mrs. Straw during one roar of laughter . " They 're always so coarse . " " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Straw said . The girl was leaning forward , following every word , tense and excited . For a minute the heavy sullenness of her face had vanished ; she was laughing with everyone else , her eyes light . " She thinks it 's funny , " Mrs. Straw said . Mrs. Wilkins drew her shoulders closer together and shivered . She attacked her dish of ice cream primly . " I always wonder , " she began after a minute , " why places like this , you know , with really good food , never seem to think about desserts . It 's always ice cream or something . " " Nothing better than ice cream , " Mrs. Straw said . " You 'd think they 'd have pastries , or some nice pudding , " Mrs. Wilkins said . " They never seem to give any thought to it . " " I 've never seen anything like that fig-and-date pudding you make , Jen , " Mrs. Straw said . " Walter always used to say that was the best  --  " Mrs. Wilkinsbegan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ventriloquist and the dummy were bowing , the man bowingdeeply from the waist and the dummy bobbing his headp205courteously ; the orchestra began quickly with a dance tune , and the man and the dummy turned and trotted off the stage . " Thank heavens , " Mrs. Wilkins said . " I have n't seen one of those for years , " Mrs. Straw said . The girl in green had risen , waiting for the man and the dummy to come back to the table . The man sat down heavily , the dummy still on his knee , and the girl sat down again , on the edge of her chair , asking him something urgently . " What do you think ? " he said loudly , without looking at her . He waved to a waiter , who hesitated , looking in back of him at the table where the woman who owned the restaurantwas sitting alone . After a minute the waiter approached the man , and the girl said , her voice clear over the soft waltz the orchestra was playing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go somewhere and eat . " The man spoke to the waiter , ignoring the girl 's hand on his arm . He turned to the dummy , speaking softly , and the dummy 's face and broad grin looked at the girl and then back at the man . The girl sat back , looking out of the corners of her eyes at the owner of the restaurant . " I 'd hate to be married to a man like that , " Mrs. Straw said . " He 's certainly not a very good comedian , " Mrs. Wilkins said . The girl was leaning forward again , arguing , and the man was talking to the dummy , making the dummy nod in agreement . When the girl put a hand on his shoulder the man shrugged it away without turning around . The girl 's voice rose again . " Listen , Joey , " she was saying . " In a minute , " the man said . " I just want to have this one drink . " " Yeah , leave him alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't need another drink now , Joey , " the girl said . " You can get another drink later . " The man said , " Look , honey , I 've got a drink ordered . I ca n't leave before it comes . " " Why do n't you make old deadhead shut up ? " the dummy said to the man , " always making a fuss when she sees someonehaving a good time . Why do n't you tell her to shut up ? " " You should n't talk like that , " the man said to the dummy . " It 's not nice . " " 7 can talk if I want to , " the dummy said . " She ca n't make me stop . " " Joey , " the girl said , " I want to talk to you . Listen , let 's go somewhere and talk . " " Shut up for a minute , " the dummy said to the girl . " For God 's sake will you shut up for a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , interested in the dummy 's loud voice , and laughing already , hearing him talk . " Please be quiet , " the girl said . " Yeah , do n't make such a fuss , " the man said to the dummy . " I 'm just going to have this one drink . She does n't mind . " " He 's not going to bring you any drink , " the girl said impatiently . " They told him not to . They would n't give you a drink here , the way you 're acting . " " I 'm acting fine , " the man said. " 7 'm the one making the fuss , " the dummy said . " It 's time someone told you , sweetheart , you 're going to get into trouble acting like a wet blanket all the time . A man wo n't stand for it forever . " " Be quiet , " the girl said , looking around her anxiously . " Everyone can hear you . " " Let them hear me , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience and raised his voice . " Justp207because a man wants to have a good time she has to freeze up like an icebag . " " Now , Marmaduke , " the man said to the dummy , " you 'd better talk nicer to your old mother . " " Why , I would n't tell that old bag the right time , " the dummy said . " If she does n't like it here , let her get back on the streets . " Mrs. Wilkins ' mouth opened , and shut again ; she put her napkin down on the table and stood up . While Mrs. Straw watched blankly she walked over to the other table and slapped the dummy sharply across the face . By the time she had turned and come back to her own table Mrs. Straw had her coat on and was standing . " We 'll pay on the way out , " Mrs. Wilkins said curtly . She picked up her coat and the two of them walked with dignity to the door . For a moment the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its head awry . Then the girl reached over and straightened the wooden head.  |p209THE  BASEMENT ROOM of the bookstore seemed to be enormous ; it stretched in long rows of books off into dimness at either end , with books lined in tall bookcases along the walls , and books standing in piles on the floor . At the foot of the spiral staircase winding down from the neat small store upstairs , Mr. Harris , owner and sales-clerk of the bookstore , had a small desk , cluttered with catalogues , lighted by one dirty overhead lamp . The same lamp served to light the shelves which crowded heavily around Mr. Harris ' desk ; farther away , along the lines of book tables , there were other dirty overheadlamps , to be lighted by pulling a string and turned off by the customer when he was ready to grope his way back to Mr. Harris ' desk , pay for his purchases and have them wrapped . Mr. Harris , who knew the position of any author or any title in all the heavy shelves , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen , who was standing far down the long room directly under one of the lamps , leafing through a book he had selected from the shelves . It was cold in the big basement room ; both Mr. Harris and the boy had their coats on . Occasionally Mr. Harris got up from his desk to put a meagre shovelful of coal on a small iron stove which stood in the curve of the staircase . Except when Mr. Harris got up , or the boy turned to put a book back into the shelves and take out another , the room was quiet , the books standing silent in the dim light . Then the silence was broken by the sound of the door opening in the little upstairs bookshop where Mr. Harris kept his  | best-sellers and art books on display . There was the sound of voices , while both Mr. Harris and the boy listened , and then the girl who took care of the upstairs bookshop said , " Right on down the stairs . Mr. Harris will help you . " Mr. Harris got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning on another of the overhead lamps so that his new customer would be able to see his way down . The boy put his book back in the shelves and stood with his hand on the back of it , still listening . When Mr. Harris saw that it was a woman coming down the stairs he stood back politely and said , " Watch the bottom step . There 's one more than people think . " The woman stepped carefully down and stood looking around . While she stood there a man came carefully around the turn in the staircase , ducking his head so his hat would clear the low ceiling . " Watch the bottom step , " the woman said in a soft clear voice . The man came down beside her and raised his head to look around as she had . " Quite a lot of books you have here , " he said . Mr. Harris smiled his professional smile . " Can I help you ? " The woman looked at the man , and he hesitated a minute and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quite a few of them . " He waved his hand inclusively . " Sets of books . " " Well , if it 's books you want , " Mr. Harris said , and smiled again . " Maybe the lady would like to come over and sit down ? " He led the way around to his desk , the woman followinghim and the man walking uneasily between the tables of books , his hands close to his sides as though he were afraid of breaking something . Mr. Harris gave the lady his desk chair and then sat down on the edge of his desk , shoving aside a pile of catalogues . " This is a very interesting place , " the lady said , in the samep211soft voice she had used when she spoke before . She was middle-agedand nicely dressed ; all her clothes were fairly new , but quiet and well planned for her age and air of shyness . The man was big and hearty-looking , his face reddened by the cold air and his big hands holding a pair of wool gloves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your books , " the man said . " Some good books . " " Anything in particular ? " Mr. Harris asked . The man laughed loudly , but with embarrassment . " Tell the truth , " he said , " I sound sort of foolish , now . But I do n't know much about these things , like books . " In the large quiet store his voice seemed to echo , after his wife 's soft voice and Mr. Harris ' . " We were sort of hoping you 'd be able to tell us , " he said . " None of this trash they turn out nowadays . " " He cleared his throat . " Something like Dickens , " he said . " Dickens , " Mr. Harris said . " I used to read Dickens when I was a kid , " the man said . " Books like that , now , good books . " He looked up as the boy who had been standing off among the books came over to them . " I 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Harris , " the boy asked quietly . Mr. Harris looked up . " Yes , Mr. Clark ? " he said . The boy came closer to the desk , as though unwilling to interrupt Mr. Harris with his customers . " I 'd like to take anotherlook at the Empson , " he said . Mr. Harris turned to the glass-doored bookcase immediatelybehind his desk and selected a book . " Here it is , " he said , " you 'll have it read through before you buy it at this rate . " He smiled at the big man and his wife . " Some day he 's going to come in and buy that book , " he said , " and I 'm going to go out of business from shock . "  | The boy turned away , holding the book , and the big man leaned forward to Mr. Harris . " I figure I 'd like two good sets , big , like Dickens , " he said , " and then a couple of smaller sets . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , in her soft voice . " I used to love that book , " she said to Mr. Harris . " I can let you have a very nice set of the Brontes , " Mr. Harris said . " Beautiful binding .

" It still looks good , " he said . " It 's right here when you want it , " Mr. Harris said , turning back to the bookcase with the book . " It 's pretty scarce , that book . " " I guess it 'll be here a while longer , " the boy said . " What 's the name of this book ? " the big man asked curiously . " Seven Types of Ambiguity , " the boy said .

" You ever try reading Meredith ? " " Meredith , " the big man said . " Let 's see a few of your books , " he said to Mr. Harris . " I 'd sort of like to pick out a few I want . "  | " Can I take the gentleman down there ? " the boy said to Mr. Harris . " I 've got to go back anyway to get my hat .

" He knows where the books are as well as I do , " he said to the big man . The boy started off down the aisle between the book tables , and the big man followed , still walking carefully , trying not to touch anything . They went down past the lamp still burning where the boy had left his hat and gloves , and the boy turned on another lamp further down . " Mr. Harris keeps most of his sets around here , " the boy said . " Let 's see what we can find . " He squatted down in front of the bookcases , touching the backs of the rows of books lightly with his fingers . " How do you feel about the prices ? " he asked . " I 'm willing to pay a reasonable amount for the books I have in mind , " the big man said . He touched the book in front of him experimentally , with one finger . " A hundred and fifty , two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laughed . " That ought to get you some nice books , " he said . " Never saw so many books in my life , " the big man said . " I never thought I 'd see the day when I 'd just walk into a bookstore and buy up all the books I always wanted to read . " " It 's a good feeling . " " I never got a chance to read much , " the man said . " Went right into the machine-shop where my father worked when I was much younger than you , and worked ever since . Now all of a sudden I find I have a little more money than I used to , and Mother and I decided we 'd like to get ourselves a few things we always wanted . "  | " Your wife was interested in the Brontes , " the boy said . " Here 's a very good set . " The man leaned down to look at the books the boy pointed out .

Meredith is good . And Thackeray . I think you 'd want Thackeray ; he 's a great writer . " The man took one of the books the boy handed him and opened it carefully , using only two fingers from each of his big hands . " This looks fine , " he said . " I 'll write them down , " the boy said . He took a pencil and a pocket memorandum from his coat pocket . Brontes/ ' he said , " Dickens , Meredith , Thackeray . " He ran his hand along each of the sets as he read them off . The big man narrowed his eyes . " I ought to take one more , " he said . " These wo n't quite fill up the bookcase I got for them .

" " You 're going to have a fine time , " the boy said . " That book you had a while back , " the man said . " What was that book ? " " It 's aesthetics , " the boy said . " About literature . It 's very scarce . I 've been trying to buy it for quite a while and have n't had the money . " " You go to college ? " the man asked . Seven Types of Ambiguity 215 " Yes .

The boy turned off the lamps and followed , stopping to get his hat and gloves . When the big man reached Mr. Harris ' desk he said to his wife , " That 's sure a smart kid . He knows those books right and left . " " Did you pick out what you want ? " his wife asked . " The kid has a fine list for me . " He turned to Mr. Harris and went on , " It 's quite an experience seeing a kid like that liking books the way he does . When I was his age I was working for four or five years .

After the big man had written his name and address , he stood for a minute drumming his fingers on the desk , and then he said , " Can I have another look at that book ? " " The Empson ? " Mr. Harris said , looking up . " The one the boy was so interested in . " Mr. Harris reached around to the bookcase in back of him and took out the book .

" We 've been looking forward to it for a long time . " The big man counted out the money carefully , handing the bills to Mr. Harris .

ARCHER was sitting on the bed with Kathy Valentineand Mrs. Corn , playing with the baby and gossiping , when the doorbell rang . Mrs. Archer , saying , " Oh , dear ! , " went to push the buzzer that released the outside door of the apartment building . " We had to live on the ground floor , " she called to Kathy and Mrs. Corn . " Everybody rings our bell for everything . " When the inner doorbell rang she opened the door of the apartment and saw an old man standing in the outer hall . He was wearing a long , shabby black overcoat and had a square white beard . He held out a handful of shoelaces . " Oh , " Mrs. Archer said . " Oh , I 'm terribly sorry , but  --  " " Madam , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so kind . A nickel apiece . " Mrs. Archer shook her head and backed away . " I 'm afraid not , " she said . " Thank you anyway , Madam , " he said , " for speaking courteously . The first person on this block who has been decently polite to a poor old man . " Mrs. Archer turned the doorknob back and forth nervously . " I 'm awfully sorry , " she said . Then , as he turned to go , she said , " Wait a minute , " and hurried into the bedroom . " Old man selling shoelaces , " she whispered . She pulled open the top dresser drawer , took out her pocketbook , and fumbled in the change purse . " Quarter , " she said . " Think it 's all right ? " " Sure , " Kathy said . " Probably more than he 's gotten all day . " She was Mrs. Archer 's age , and unmarried . Mrs. Corn was a stout woman in her middle fifties . They both lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Mrs. Archer 's , on account of the baby . Mrs. Archer returned to the front door . " Here , " she said , holding out the quarter . " I think it 's a shame everyone was so rude . " The old man started to offer her some shoelaces , but his hand shook and the shoelaces dropped to the floor . He leaned heavily against the wall . Mrs. Archer watched , horrified . " Good Lord , " she said , and put out her hand . As her fingers touched the dirty old overcoat she hesitated and then , tighteningher lips , she put her arm firmly through his and tried to help him through the doorway . " Girls , " she called , " come help me , quick ! " Kathy came running out of the bedroom , saying , " Did you call , Jean ? " and then stopped dead , staring . " What 'll I do ? " Mrs. Archer said , standing with her arm through the old man 's . His eyes were closed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand on his feet . " For heaven 's sake , grab him on the other side . " " Get him to a chair or something , " Kathy said . The hall was too narrow for all three of them to go down side by side , so Kathy took the old man 's other arm and half-led Mrs. Archer and him into the living-room . " Not in the good chair , " Mrs. Archer exclaimed . " In the old leather one . " They dropped the old man into the leather chair and stood back . " What on earth do we do now ? " Mrs. Archer said . " Do you have any whiskey ? " Kathy asked . Mrs. Archer shook her head . " A little wine , " she said doubtfully . Mrs. Corn came into the living-room , holding the baby . " Gracious ! " she said . " He 's drunk ! "  | " Nonsense , " Kathy said . " I would n't have let Jean bring him in if he were . " " Watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Naturally , " Mrs. Corn said . " We 're going back into the bedroom , honey , " she said to the baby , " and then we 're going to get into our lovely crib and go beddy-bye . " The old man stirred and opened his eyes . He tried to get up . " Now you stay right where you are , " Kathy ordered , " and Mrs. Archer here is going to bring you a little bit of wine . You 'd like that , would n't you ? " The old man raised his eyes to Kathy . " Thank you , " he said . Mrs. Archer went into the kitchen . After a moment 's thought she took the glass from over the sink , rinsed it out , and poured some sherry into it . She took the glass of sherry back into the living-room and handed it to Kathy . " Shall I hold it for you or can you drink by yourself ? " Kathy asked the old man . " You are much too kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kathy steadied it for him as he sipped from it , and then he pushed it away . " That 's enough , thank you , " he said . " Enough to revive me . " He tried to rise . " Thank you , " he said to Mrs. Archer , " and thank you , " to Kathy . " I had better be going along . " " Not until you 're quite firm on your feet , " Kathy said . " Ca n't afford to take chances , you know . " The old man smiled . " 7 can afford to take chances , " he said . Mrs. Corn came back into the living-room . " Baby 's in his crib , " she said , " and just about asleep already . Does he feel better now ? I 'll bet he was just drunk or hungry or some-thing . " " Of course he was , " Kathy said , fired by the idea . " He was hungry . That 's what was wrong all the time , Jean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said to the old man . " Mrs. Archer is certainly not going to let you leave here without a full meal inside of you . " Mrs. Archer looked doubtful . " I have some eggs , " she said . " Fine ! " Kathy said . " Just the thing . They 're easily digested , " she said to the old man , " and especially good if you have n't eaten for "  --  she hesitated  --  " for a while . " " Black coffee , " Mrs. Corn said , " if you ask me . Look at his hands shake . " " Nervous exhaustion , " Kathy said firmly . " A nice hot cup of bouillon is all he needs to be good as ever , and he has to drink it very slowly until his stomach gets used to food again . The stomach , " she told Mrs. Archer and Mrs. Corn , " shrinks when it remains empty for any great period of time . " " I would rather not trouble you , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kathy said . " We 've got to see that you get a good hot meal to go on with . " She took Mrs. Archer 's arm and began to walk her out to the kitchen . " Just some eggs , " she said . " Fry four or five . I 'll get you half a dozen later . I do n't suppose you have any bacon . I 'll tell you , fry up a few potatoes too . He wo n't care if they 're half-raw . These people eat things like heaps of fried potatoes and eggs and  --  " " There 's some canned figs left over from lunch , " Mrs. Archer said . " I was wondering what to do with them . " " I 've got to run back and keep an eye on him , " Kathy said . " He might faint again or something . You just fry up those eggs and potatoes . I 'll send Blanche out if she 'll come . " Mrs. Archer measured out enough coffee for two cups and set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her frying pan . " Kathy , " she said , " I 'm just a little worried . If he really isp223drunk , I mean , and if Jim should hear about it , with the baby here and everything . . . . " " Why , Jean ! " Kathy said . " You should live in the country for a while , I guess . Women always give out meals to starving men . And you do n't need to tell Jim . Blanche and I certainly wo n't say anything . " " Well , " said Mrs. Archer , " you 're sure he is n't drunk ? " " I know a starving man when I see one , " Kathy said . " When an old man like that ca n't stand up and his hands shake and he looks so funny , that means he 's starving to death . Literally starving . " " Oh , my ! " said Mrs. Archer . She hurried to the cupboard under the sink and took out two potatoes . " Two enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good deed . " Kathy giggled . " Just a bunch of Girl Scouts , " she said . She started out of the kitchen , and then she stopped and turned around . " You have any pie ? They always eat pie . " " It was for dinner , though , " Mrs. Archer said . " Oh , give it to him , " Kathy said . " We can run out and get some more after he goes . " While the potatoes were frying , Mrs. Archer put a plate , a cup and saucer , and a knife and fork and spoon on the dinette table . Then , as an afterthought , she picked up the dishes and , taking a paper bag out of a cupboard , tore it in half and spread it smoothly on the table and put the dishes back . She got a glass and filled it with water from the bottle in the refrigerator , cut three slices of bread and put them on a plate , and then cut a small square of butter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she got a paper napkin from the box in the cupboard and put it beside the plate , took it up after a minute to fold it into a triangular shape , and put it back . Finally she put the pepper and salt shakers on the table and got out a box of eggs . She went to the door and called , " Kathy ! Ask him how does he want his eggs fried ? " There was a murmur of conversation in the living-room and Kathy called back , " Sunny side up ! " Mrs. Archer took out four eggs and then another and broke them one by one into the frying-pan . When they were done she called out , " All right , girls ! Bring him in ! " Mrs. Corn came into the kitchen , inspected the plate of potatoesand eggs , and looked at Mrs. Archer without speaking . Then Kathy came , leading the old man by the arm . She escortedhim to the table and sat him down in a chair . " There , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal . " The old man looked at Mrs. Archer . " I 'm very grateful , " he said . " Is n't that nice ! " Kathy said . She nodded approvingly at Mrs. Archer . The old man regarded the plate of eggs and potatoes . " Now pitch right in , " Kathy said . " Sit down , girls . I 'll get a chair from the bedroom . " The old man picked up the salt and shook it gently over the eggs . " This looks delicious , " he said finally . " You just go right ahead and eat , " Kathy said , reappearing with a chair . " We want to see you get filled up . Pour him some coffee , Jean . " Mrs. Archer went to the stove and took up the coffeepot . " Please do n't bother , " he said . " That 's all right , " Mrs. Archer said , filling the old man 's cup . She sat down at the table . The old man picked up the fork and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ napkin and spread it carefully over his knees . " What 's your name ? " Kathy asked . " O'Flaherty , Madam . John O'Flaherty. "  | " Well , John , " Kathy said , " I am Miss Valentine and this lady is Mrs. Archer and the other one is Mrs. Corn . " " How do you do ? " the old man said . " I gather you 're from the old country , " Kathy said . " I beg your pardon ? " " Irish , are n't you ? " Kathy said . " I am , Madam . " The old man plunged the fork into one of the eggs and watched the yoke run out onto the plate . " I knew Yeats , " he said suddenly . " Really ? " Kathy said , leaning forward . " Let me see  --  he was the writer , was n't he ? " " Come out of charity , come dance with me in Ireland , ' " the old man said . He rose and , holding on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thank you again , Madam , for your generosity . " He turned and started for the front door . The three women got up and followed him . " But you did n't finish , " Mrs. Corn said . " The stomach , " the old man said , " as this lady has pointed out , shrinks . Yes , indeed , " he went on reminiscently , " I knew Yeats . " At the front door he turned and said to Mrs. Archer , " Your kindness should not go unrewarded . " He gestured to the shoelaceslying on the floor . " These , " he said , " are for you . For your kindness . Divide them with the other ladies . " " But I would n't dream  --  " Mrs. Archer began . " I insist , " the old man said , opening the door . " A small return , but all that I have to offer . Pick them up yourself , " he added abruptly . Then he turned and thumbed his nose at Mrs. Corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well !

" Mrs. Archer , her eyes on Kathy , made a tentative motion of pushing the old man through the door , but he forestalled her . " Come dance with me in Ireland , ' " he said . Supporting himself against the wall , he reached the outer door and opened it . " And time runs on , " he said .

" I think I 'll just go crazy . " " Is there anything we can do to help ? " Mrs. Tylor asked . She smiled down at James . " Perhaps James would like to spend the afternoon with us ? " " That would be a relief , " Mrs. Harris agreed . She twisted around to look at James behind her . " Would you like to playp231with Carol this afternoon , honey ? " James shook his head mutely and Mrs. Tylor said to him brightly , " Carol 's two older sisters might , just might take her to the movies , James . You 'd like that , would n't you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " James does not go to movies . " " Oh , well , of course , " Mrs. Tylor said , " lots of mothers do n't , of course , but when a child has two older . . .. " " It is n't that , " Mrs. Harris said . " We do not go to movies , any of us . " Mrs. Tylor quickly registered the " any " as meaning there was probably a Mr. Harris somewhere around , and then her mind snapped back and she said blankly , " Do n't go to movies ? " " Mr. Harris , " Mrs. Harris said carefully , " feels that movies are intellectually retarding . We do not go to movies . " " Naturally , " Mrs. Tylor said . " Well , I 'm sure Carol would n't mind staying home this afternoon . She 'd love to play with James . Mr. Harris , " she added cautiously , " would n't object to a sandbox ? " " I want to go to the movies , " Carol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you and James come over and rest at our house for a while ? You 've probably been running around all morning . " Mrs. Harris hesitated , watching the movers . " Thank you , " she said finally . With James following along behind her , she came through the Tylors ' gate , and Mrs. Tylor said , " If we sit in the garden out back we can still keep an eye on your movers . " She gave Carol a small push . " Show James the sandbox , dear , " she said firmly . Carol took James sullenly by the hand and led him over to the sandbox . " See ? " she said , and went back to kick the fence pickets deliberately . Mrs. Tylor sat Mrs. Harris in one of the garden chairs and went over and found a shovel for James to dig with . " It certainly feels good to sit down , " Mrs. Harris said . She sighed . " Sometimes I feel that moving is the most terrible thing I have to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Tylor said , and Mrs. Harris nodded . " We 'll be glad to get nice neighbors , " Mrs. Tylor went on . " There 's something so nice about congenialpeople right next door . I 'll be running over to borrow cups of sugar , " she finished roguishly . " I certainly hope you will , " Mrs. Harris said . " We had such disagreeable people next door to us in our old house . Small things , you know , and they do irritate you so . " Mrs. Tylor sighed sympathetically . " The radio , for instance , " Mrs. Harris continued , " all day long , and so loud . " Mrs. Tylor caught her breath for a minute . " You must be sure and tell us if ours is ever too loud . " " Mr. Harris can not bear the radio , " Mrs. Harris said . " We do not own one , of course . " " Of course , " Mrs. Tylor said . " No radio . " Mrs. Harris looked at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband is crazy . " " Of course not , " Mrs. Tylor said . " After all , lots of people do n't like radios ; my oldest nephew , now , he 's just the other way  --  2 ' " Well , " Mrs. Harris said , " newspapers , too . " Mrs. Tylor recognized finally the faint nervous feeling that was tagging her ; it was the way she felt when she was irrevocablyconnected with something dangerously out of control : her car , for instance , on an icy street , or the time on Virginia 's roller skates . . . . Mrs. Harris was staring absent-mindedlyp233at the movers going in and out , and she was saying , " It is n't as though we had n't ever seen a newspaper , not like the movies at all ; Mr. Harris just feels that the newspapers are a mass degradation of taste . You really never need to read a newspaper , you know , " she said , looking around anxiously at Mrs. Tylor . " I never read anything but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of years , " Mrs. Harris said . " When we were first married , of course . Before James was born . " " What is your husband 's business ? " Mrs. Tylor asked timidly . Mrs. Harris lifted her head proudly . " He 's a scholar , " she said . " He writes monographs . " Mrs. Tylor opened her mouth to speak , but Mrs. Harris leaned over and put her hand out and said , " It 's terribly hard for people to understand the desire for a really peaceful life . " " What , " Mrs. Tylor said , " what does your husband do for relaxation ? " " He reads plays , " Mrs. Harris said . She looked doubtfully over at James . " Pre-Elizabethan , of course . " " Of course , " Mrs. Tylor said , and looked nervously at James , who was shoveling sand into a pail . " People are really very unkind , " Mrs. Harris said . " Those people I was telling you about , next door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three times they deliberately left their New Fork Times on our doorstep . Once James nearly got it . " " Good Lord , " Mrs. Tylor said . She stood up . " Carol , " she called emphatically , " do n't go away . It 's nearly time for lunch , dear . " " Well , " Mrs. Harris said . " I must go and see if the movers have done anything right . "  |p234Feeling  as though she had been rude , Mrs. Tylor said , " Where is Mr. Harris now ? " " At his mother 's , " Mrs. Harris said . " He always stays there when we move . " " Of course , " Mrs. Tylor said , feeling as though she had been saying nothing else all morning . " They do n't turn the radio on while he 's there , " Mrs. Harris explained . " Of course , " Mrs. Tylor said . Mrs. Harris held out her hand and Mrs. Tylor took it . " I do so hope we 'll be friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it means such a lot to have really thoughtful neighbors . And we 've been so unlucky . " " Of course , " Mrs. Tylor said , and then came back to herselfabruptly . " Perhaps one evening soon we can get together for a game of bridge ? " She saw Mrs. Harris 's face and said , " No . Well , anyway , we must all get together some evening soon . " They both laughed . " It does sound silly , does n't it , " Mrs. Harris said . " Thanks so much for all your kindness this morning . " " Anything we can do , " Mrs. Tylor said . " If you want to send James over this afternoon . " " Perhaps I shall , " Mrs. Harris said . " If you really do n't mind . " " Of course , " Mrs. Tylor said . " Carol , dear . " With her arm around Carol she walked out to the front of the house and stood watching Mrs. Harris and James go into their house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Tylor and Carol waved back . " Ca n't I go to the movies , " Carol said , " please , Mother ? " " I 'll go with you , dear , " Mrs. Tylor said.  |p235FOR  SOME REASON a tune was running through her head when she and her husband got on the train in New Hampshire for their trip to New York ; they had not been to New York for nearly a year , but the tune was from farther back than that . It was from the days when she was fifteen or sixteen , and had never seen New York except in movies , when the city was made up , to her , of penthouses filled with Noel Cowardpeople ; when the height and speed and luxury and gaiety that made up a city like New York were confused inextricablywith the dullness of being fifteen , and beauty unreachableand far in the movies . " What is that tune ? " she said to her husband , and hummed it . " It 's from some old movie , I think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hummed it himself . " Ca n't remember the words . " He sat back comfortably . He had hung up their coats , put the suitcases on the rack , and had taken his magazine out . " I 'll think of it sooner or later , " he said . She looked out the window first , tasting it almost secretly , savoring the extreme pleasure of being on a moving train with nothing to do for six hours but read and nap and go into the dining-car , going farther and farther every minute from the children , from the kitchen floor , with even the hills being incrediblyleft behind , changing into fields and trees too far away from home to be daily . " I love trains , " she said , and her husband nodded sympathetically into his magazine . Two weeks ahead , two unbelievable weeks , with all ar- rangements made , no further planning to do , except perhaps what theatres or what restaurants . A friend with an apartment went on a convenient vacation , there was enough money in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new snow suits for the children ; there was the smoothness of unopposedarrangements , once the initial obstacles had been overcome , as though when they had really made up their minds , nothing dared stop them . The baby 's sore throat cleared up . The plumber came , finished his work in two days , and left . The dresses had been altered in time ; the hardware store could be left safely , once they had found the excuse of looking over new city products . New York had not burned down , had not been quarantined , their friend had gone away according to schedule , and Brad had the keys to the apartment in his pocket . Everyone knew where to reach everyone else ; there was a list of plays not to miss and a list of items to look out for in the stores  --  diapers , dress materials , fancy canned goods , tarnish-proof silverware boxes . And , finally , the train was there , performing its function , pacing through the afternoon , carrying them legally and with determination to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of the afternoon on a train , at the other fortunate peopletraveling , at the sunny country outside , looked again to make sure , and then opened her book . The tune was still in her head , she hummed it and heard her husband take it up softly as he turned a page in his magazine . In the dining-car she ate roast beef , as she would have done in a restaurant at home , reluctant to change over too quickly to the new , tantalizing food of a vacation . She had ice cream for dessert but became uneasy over her coffee because they were due in New York in an hour and she still had to putP237on her coat and hat , relishing every gesture , and Brad must take the suitcases down and put away the magazines . They stood at the end of the car for the interminable underground run , picking up their suitcases and putting them down again , moving restlessly inch by inch . The station was a momentary shelter , moving visitors graduallyinto a world of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality of the street outside . She saw it for a minute from the sidewalk before she was in a taxi movinginto the middle of it , and then they were bewilderingly caught and carried on uptown and whirled out on to another sidewalk and Brad paid the taxi driver and put his head back to look up at the apartment house . " This is it , all right , " he said , as though he had doubted the driver 's ability to find a number so simply given . Upstairs in the elevator , and the key fit the door . They had never seen their friend 's apartment before , but it was reasonably familiar  --  a friend moving from New Hampshire to New York carries private pictures of a home not erasable in a few years , and the apartment had enough of home in it to settle Brad immediately in the right chair and comfort her with instinctive trust of the linen and blankets . " This is home for two weeks , " Brad said , and stretched . After the first few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was below , as arranged , and the houses across the street were apartment houses filled with unknownpeople . " It 's wonderful , " she said . There were cars down there , and people , and the noise was there . " I 'm so happy , " she said , and kissed her husband . They went sight-seeing the first day ; they had breakfast in an Automat and went to the top of the Empire State building .   " Got it all fixed up now , " Brad said , at the top . " Wonder just where that plane hit . " They tried to peer down on all four sides , but were embarrassed about asking . " After all , " she said reasonably , gigglingin a corner , " if something of mine got broken I would n't want people poking around asking to see the pieces . " " If you owned the Empire State building you would n't care , " Brad said . They traveled only in taxis the first few days , and one taxi had a door held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and laughed silently at each other , and on about the third day , the taxi they were riding in got a flat fire on Broadway and they had to get out and find another . " We 've only got eleven days left , " she said one day , and then , seemingly minutes later , " we 've already been here six days . " They had got in touch with the friends they had expected to get in touch with , they were going to a Long Island summer home for a week end . " It looks pretty dreadful right now , " their hostess said cheerfully over the phone , " and we 're leavingin a week ourselves , but I 'd never forgive you if you did n't see it once while you were here . " The weather had been fair but cool , with a definite autumn awareness , and the clothes in the store windows were dark and already hinting at furs and velvets . She wore her coat every day , and suits most of the time . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the apartment , and she was thinking now of getting a sweater in one of the big stores , something impractical for New Hampshire , but probably good for Long Island . " I have to do some shopping , at least one day , " she said to Brad , and he groaned . " Do n't ask me to carry packages , " he said .   " You are n't up to a good day 's shopping , " she told him , " not after all this walking around you 've been doing . Why do n't you go to a movie or something ? " " I want to do some shopping myself , " he said mysteriously . Perhaps he was talking about her Christmas present ; she had thought vaguely of getting such things done in New York ; the children would be pleased with novelties from the city , toys not seen in their home stores . At any rate she said , " You 'll probably be able to get to your wholesalers at last . " They were on their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live by a miracle and warned them consequentlynot to quarrel with the appearance of the building , or the stairs , or the neighborhood . All three were bad , and the stairs were three flights , narrow and dark , but there was a place to live at the top . Their friend had not been in New York long , but he lived by himself in two rooms , and had easily caught the mania for slim tables and low bookcases which made his rooms look too large for the furniture in some places , too cramped and uncomfortable in others . " What a lovely place , " she said when she came in , and then was sorry when her host said , " Some day this damn situation will let up and I 'll be able to settle down in a really decent place . " There were other people there ; they sat and talked companionablyabout the same subjects then current in New Hampshire , but they drank more than they would have at home and it left them strangely unaffected ; their voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the other hand , were smaller , and they moved a finger where in New Hampshirethey would have waved an arm . Margaret said frequently , " We 're just staying here for a couple of weeks , on a vacation , " and she said , " It 's wonderful , so exciting , " and she said , " We were terribly lucky ; this friend went out of town just at the right .... " Finally the room was very full and noisy , and she went into a corner near a window to catch her breath . The window had been opened and shut all evening , depending on whether the person standing next to it had both hands free ; and now it was shut , with the clear sky outside . Someone came and stood next to her , and she said , " Listen to the noise outside . It 's as bad as it is inside . " He said , " In a neighborhood like this someone 's always gettingkilled . " She frowned . " It sounds different than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . " " Alcoholics , " he said . " Drunks in the streets . Fighting going on across the way . " He wandered away , carrying his drink . She opened the window and leaned out , and there were peoplehanging out of the windows across the way shouting , and people standing in the street looking up and shouting , and from across the way she heard clearly , " Lady , lady . " They must mean me , she thought , they 're all looking this way . She leaned out farther and the voices shouted incoherently but somehow making an audible whole , " Lady , your house is on fire , lady , lady . " She closed the window firmly and turned around to the other people in the room , raising her voice a little . " Listen , " she said , " they 're saying the house is on fire . " She was desperately afraid of their laughing at her , of looking like a fool while Brad across the room looked at her blushing . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and added , " They say , " for fear of sounding too vehement . The people nearest to her turned and someone said , " She says the house is on fire . " She wanted to get to Brad and could n't see him ; her host wasp241not in sight either , and the people all around were strangers . They do n't listen to me , she thought , I might as well not be here , and she went to the outside door and opened it . There was no smoke , no flame , but she was telling herself , I might as well not be here , so she abandoned Brad in panic and ran without her hat and coat down the stairs , carrying a glass in one hand and a package of matches in the other . The stairs were insanely long , but they were clear and safe , and she opened the street door and ran out . A man caught her arm and said , " Everyone out of the house ? " and she said , " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept around the corner , with people leaning out of the windows watching them , and the man holding her arm said , " It 's down here , " and left her . The fire was two houses away ; they could see flames behind the top windows , and smoke against the night sky , but in ten minutes it was finished and the fire engines pulled away with an air of martyrdom for hauling out all their equipment to put out a ten-minute fire . She went back upstairs slowly and with embarrassment , and found Brad and took him home . " I was so frightened , " she said to him when they were safely in bed , " I lost my head completely . " " You should have tried to find someone , " he said . " They would n't listen , " she insisted . " I kept telling them and they would n't listen and then I thought I must have been mistaken . I had some idea of going down to see what was going on . " Lucky it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt trapped , " she said . " High up in that old building with a fire ; it 's like a nightmare . And in a strange city . " " Well , it 's all over now , " Brad said . The same faint feeling of insecurity tagged her the next day ; she went shopping alone and Brad went off to see hard- ware , after all . She got on a bus to go downtown and the bus was too full to move when it came time for her to get out . Wedged standing in the aisle she said , " Out , please , " and , " Excuse me , " and by the time she was loose and near the door the bus had started again and she got off a stop beyond . " No one listens to me , " she said to herself . " Maybe it 's because I 'm too polite . " In the stores the prices were all too high and the sweaters looked disarmingly like New Hampshire ones . The toys for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York children : hideous little parodies of adult life , cash registers , tiny pushcarts with imitation fruit , telephones that really worked ( as if there were n't enough phones in New York that really worked ) , miniature milk bottles in a carrying case . " We get our milk from cows , " Margaret told the salesgirl . " My children would n't know what these were . " She was exaggerating , and felt guilty for a minute , but no one was around to catch her . She had a picture of small children in the city dressed like their parents , following along with a miniature mechanical civilization , toy cash registers in larger and larger sizes that eased them into the real thing , millions of clattering jerking small imitations that prepared them nicely for taking over the large useless toys their parents lived by . She bought a pair of skis for her son , which she knew would be inadequate for the New Hampshire snow , and a wagon for her daughter inferiorto the one Brad could make at home in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with special small records , the kiddie cosmetics , she left the store and started home . She was frankly afraid by now to take a bus ; she stood on the corner and waited for a taxi . Glancing down at her feet , she saw a dime on the sidewalk and tried to pick it up , butp243there were too many people for her to bend down , and she was afraid to shove to make room for fear of being stared at . She put her foot on the dime and then saw a quarter near it , and a nickel . Someone dropped a pocketbook , she thought , and put her other foot on the quarter , stepping quickly to make it look natural ; then she saw another dime and another nickel , and a third dime in the gutter . People were passing her , back and forth , all the time , rushing , pushing against her , not looking at her , and she was afraid to get down and start gathering up the money . Other people saw it and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick it up . They were all embarrassed , or in too much of a hurry , or too crowded . A taxi stopped to let someone off , and she hailed it . She lifted her feet off the dime and the quarter , and left them there when she got into the taxi . This taxi went slowly and bumped as it went ; she had begun to notice that the gradual decay was not peculiar to the taxis . The buses were cracking open in unimportant seams , the leather seats broken and stained . The buildings were going , too  --  in one of the nicest stores there had been a great gaping hole in the tiled foyer , and you walked around it . Corners of the buildings seemed to be crumbling away into fine dust that drifted downward , the granite was eroding unnoticed . Every window she saw on her way uptown seemed to be broken ; perhaps every street corner was peppered with small change . The people were moving faster than ever before ; a girl in a red hat appeared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the lower side before you could see the hat ; store windows were so terribly bright because you only caught them for a fraction of a second . The people seemed hurled on in a frantic action that made every hour forty-five minutes long , every day nine hours , every year fourteen days.  | Food was so elusively fast , eaten in such a hurry , that you were always hungry , always speeding to a new meal with new people . Everything was imperceptibly quicker every minute . She stepped into the taxi on one side and stepped out the other side at her home ; she pressed the fifth-floor button on the elevator and was coming down again , bathed and dressed and ready for dinner with Brad . They went out for dinner and were coming in again , hungry and hurrying to bed in order to get to breakfast with lunch beyond . They had been in New York nine days ; tomorrow was Saturday and they were going to Long Island , coming home Sunday , and then Wednesday they were going home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it they were on the train to Long Island ; the train was broken , the seats torn and the floor dirty ; one of the doors would n't open and the windows would n't shut . Passing through the outskirts of the city , she thought , It 's as though everything were traveling so fast that the solid stuff could n't stand it and were going to pieces under the strain , cornices blowing off and windows caving in . She knew she was afraid to say it truly , afraid to face the knowledge that it was a voluntary neck-breaking speed , a deliberate whirling faster and faster to end in destruction . On Long Island , their hostess led them into a new piece of New York , a house filled with New York furniture as though on rubber bands , pulled this far , stretched taut , and ready to snap back to the city , to an apartment , as soon as the door was opened and the lease , fully paid , had expired . " We 've had this place every year for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't have gotten it possibly this year . " " It 's an awfully nice place , " Brad said . " I 'm surprised you do n't live here all year round . "  | " Got to get back to the city some time , " their hostess said , and laughed . " Not much like New Hampshire , " Brad said . He was beginning to be a little homesick , Margaret thought ; he wants to yell , just once . Since the fire scare she was apprehensive about large groups of people gathering together ; when friends began to drop in after dinner she waited for a while , telling herself they were on the ground floor , she could run right outside , all the windows were open ; then she excused herself and went to bed . When Brad came to bed much later she woke up and he said irritably , " We 've been playing anagrams . Such crazy people . " She said sleepily , " Did you win ? " and fell asleep before he told her . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their host and hostess read the Sunday papers . " If you turn to the right outside the door , " their hostess said encouragingly , " and walk about three blocks down , you 'll come to our beach . " " What do they want with our beach ? " their host said . " It 's too damn cold to do anything down there . " " They can look at the water , " their hostess said . They walked down to the beach ; at this time of year it was bare and windswept , yet still nodding hideously under traces of its summer plumage , as though it thought itself warmly inviting . There were occupied houses on the way there , for instance , and a lonely lunchstand was open , bravely advertising hot dogs and root beer . The man in the lunchstandwatched them go by , his face cold and unsympathetic . They walked far past him , out of sight of houses , on to a stretch of grey pebbled sand that lay between the grey water on one side and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imagine going swimming here , " she said with a shiver . The beach pleased her ; it was oddly familiar and reassuring and at the same time that she realized this , the little tune came back to her , bringing a double recollection . The beach was the one where she had lived in imagination , writing for herself dreary love-broken stories where the heroine walked beside the wild waves ; the little tune was the symbol of the golden world she escaped into to avoid the everyday drearinessthat drove her into writing depressing stories about the beach . She laughed out loud and Brad said , " What on earth 's so funny about his Godforsaken landscape ? " " I was just thinking how far away from the city it seems , " she said falsely . The sky and the water and the sand were grey enough to make it feel like late afternoon instead of midmorning ; she was tired and wanted to go back , but Brad said suddenly , " Look at that , " and she turned and saw a girl running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hair flying behind her . " Only way to get warm on a day like this , " Brad remarked , but Margaret said , " She looks frightened . " The girl saw them and came toward them , slowing down as she approached them . She was eager to reach them but when she came within speaking distance the familiar embarrassment , the not wanting to look like a fool , made her hesitate and look from one to the other of them uncomfortably . " Do you know where I can find a policeman ? " she asked finally . Brad looked up and down the bare rocky beach and said solemnly , " There do n't seem to be any around . Is there something we can do ? " " I do n't think so , " the girl said . " I really need a policeman . " They go to the police for everything , Margaret thought , these people , these New York people , it 's as though they hadip247selected a section of the population to act as problem-solvers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policeman . " Be glad to help you if we can , " Brad said . The girl hesitated again . " Well , if you must know , " she said crossly , " there 's a leg up there . " They waited politely for the girl to explain , but she only said , " Come on , then , " and waved to them to follow her . She led them over the dunes to a spot near a small inlet , where the dunes gave way abruptly to an intruding head of water . A leg was lying on the sand near the water , and the girl gestured at it and said , " There , " as though it were her own property and they had insisted on having a share . They walked over to it and Brad bent down gingerly . " It 's a leg all right , " he said . It looked like part of a wax dummy , a death-white wax leg neatly cut off at top-thigh and again just above the ankle , bent comfortably at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real , " Brad said , his voice slightly different . " You 're right about that policeman . " They walked together to the lunchstand and the man **26;4102;TOOLONG while Brad called the police . When the police came they all walked out again to where the leg was lying and Brad gave the police their names and addresses , and then said , " Is it all right to go on home ? " " What the hell you want to hang around for ? " the policemaninquired with heavy humor . " You waiting for the rest of him ? " They went back to their host and hostess , talking about the leg , and their host apologized , as though he had been guilty of a breach of taste in allowing his guests to come on a human leg ; their hostess said with interest , " There was an arm washed up in Bensonhurst , I 've been reading about it . " " One of these killings , " the host said.  |p248U|pstairs  Margaret said abruptly , " I suppose it starts to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " What starts to happen ? " she said hysterically , " People starting to come apart . " In order to reassure their host and hostess about their mindingthe leg , they stayed until the last afternoon train to New York . Back in their apartment again it seemed to Margaret that the marble in the house lobby had begun to age a little ; even in two days there were new perceptible cracks . The elevatorseemed a little rusty , and there was a fine film of dust over everything in the apartment . They went to bed feeling uncomfortable , and the next morning Margaret said immediately , " I 'm going to stay in today . " " You 're not upset about yesterday , are you ? " " Not a bit , " Margaret said . " I just want to stay in and rest . " After some discussion Brad decided to go off again by himself ; he still had people it was important to see and places he must go in the few days they had left . After breakfast in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying the mystery story she had bought on the way . She hung up her coat and hat and sat down by the window with the noise and the people far below , looking out at the sky where it was grey beyond the houses across the street . I 'm not going to worry about it , she said to herself , no sense thinking all the time about things like that , spoil your vacation and Brad 's too . No sense worrying , people get ideas like that and then worry about them . The nasty little tune was running through her head again , with its burden of suavity and expensive perfume . The houses across the street were silent and perhaps unoccupied at this time of day ; she let her eyes move with the rhythm of the tune , from window to window along one floor . By gliding1p249quickly across two windows , she could make one line of the tune fit one floor of windows , and then a quick breath and a drop down to the next floor ; it had the same number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then the next floor and the next . She stopped suddenly when it seemed to her that the windowsill she had just passed had soundlessly crumpled and fallen into fine sand ; when she looked back it was there as before but then it seemed to be the windowsill above and to the right , and finally a corner of the roof . No sense worrying , she told herself , forcing her eyes down to the street , stop thinking about things all the time . Looking down at the street for long made her dizzy and she stood up and went into the small bedroom of the apartment . She had made the bed before going out to breakfast , like any good housewife , but now she deliberately took it apart , stripping the blankets and sheets off one by one , and then she made it again , taking a long time over the corners and smoothing out every wrinkle. " ? hat 's done , " she said when she was through , and went back to the window . When she looked across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sills dissolvingand falling downward . She leaned forward and looked down at her own window , something she had never thought of before , down to the sill . It was partly eaten away ; when she touched the stone a few crumbs rolled off and fell . It was eleven o'clock ; Brad was looking at blowtorches by now and would not be back before one , if even then . She thought of writing a letter home , but the impulse left her beforeshe found paper and pen . Then it occurred to her that she might take a nap , a thing she had never done in the morning in her life , and she went in and lay down on the bed . Lying down , she felt the building shaking.  | No sense worrying , she told herself again , as though it were a charm against witches , and got up and found her coat and hat and put them on . I 'll just get some cigarettes and some letter paper , she thought , just run down to the corner . Panic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too fast , and when she stepped out in the lobby it was only the people standing around who kept her from running . As it was , she went quickly out of the building and into the street . For a minute she hesitated , wanting to go back . The cars were going past so rapidly , the people hurrying as always , but the panic of the elevator drove her on finally . She went to the corner , and , following the people flying along ahead , ran out into the street , to hear a horn almost overhead and a shout from behind her , and the noise of brakes . She ran blindly on and reached the other side where she stopped and looked around . The truck was going on its appointed way around the corner , the people going past on either side of her , parting to go around her where she stood . No one even noticed me , she thought with reassurance , everyone who saw me has gone by long ago . She went into the drugstore ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now seemed safer to her than the street  --  she could walk up the stairs . Coming out of the store and walking to the corner , she kept as close to the buildings as possible , refusing to give way to the rightful traffic coming out of the doorways . On the corner she looked carefully at the light ; it was green , but it looked as though it were going to change . Always safer to wait , she thought , do n't want to walk into another truck . People pushed past her and some were caught in the middle of the street when the light changed . One woman , more cowardlythan the rest , turned and ran back to the curb , but thep251others stood in the middle of the street , leaning forward and then backward according to the traffic moving past them on both sides . One got to the farther curb in a brief break in the line of cars , the others were a fraction of a second too late and waited . Then the light changed again and as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go , but a taxi swinging wildly around her corner frightened her back and she stood on the curb again . By the time the taxi had gone the light was due to change again and she thought , I can wait once more , no sense getting caught out in the middle . A man beside her tapped his foot impatiently for the light to change back ; two girls came past her and walked out into the street a few steps to wait , moving back a little when cars came too close , talking busily all the time . I ought to stay right with them , Margaret thought , but then they moved back against her and the light changed and the man next to her charged into the street and the two girls in front waited a minute and then moved slowly on , still talking , and Margaret started to follow and then decided to wait . A crowd of people formed around her suddenly ; they had come off a bus and were crossing here , and she had a sudden feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street when all of them moved as one with the light changing , and she elbowed her way desperately out of the crowd and went off to lean against a building and wait . It seemed to her that people passing were beginning to look at her . What do they think of me , she wondered , and stood up straight as though she were waiting for someone . She looked at her watch and frowned , and then thought , What a fool I must look like , no one here ever saw me before , they all go by too fast . She went back to the curb again but the green light was just changing to red and she thought , I'll go back to the drugstore and have a coke , no sense going back to that apartment . The man looked at her unsurprised in the drugstore and she sat and ordered a coke but suddenly as she was drinking it the panic caught her again and she thought of the people who had been with her when she first started to cross the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps a dozen lights while she had hesitated at the first ; people by now a mile or so downtown , because they had been going steadily while she had been trying to gather her courage . She paid the man quickly , restrained an impulse to say that there was nothing wrong with the coke , she just had to get back , that was all , and she hurried down to the corner again . The minute the light changes , she told herself firmly ; there 's no sense . The light changed before she was ready and in the minute before she collected herself traffic turning the corner overwhelmed her and she shrank back against the curb . She looked longingly at the cigar store on the opposite corner , with her apartment house beyond ; she wondered , How do people ever manage to get there , and knew that by wondering , by admitting a doubt , she was lost . The light changed and she looked at it with hatred , a dumb thing , turning back and forth , back and forth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her slyly , to see if anyone were watching , she stepped quietly backward , one step , two , until she was well away from the curb . Back in the drugstore again she waited for some sign of recognition from the clerk and saw none ; he regarded her with the same apathy as he had the first time . He gestured without interest at the telephone ; he does n't care , she thought , it does n't matter to him who I call . She had no time to feel like a fool , because they answered the phone immediately and agreeably and found him rightp253away . When he answered the phone , his voice sounding surprisedand matter-of-fact , she could only say miserably , " I 'm in the drugstore on the corner . Come and get me . " " What 's the matter ? " He was not anxious to come . " Please come and get me , " she said into the black mouthpiecethat might or-might not tell him , " please come and get me , Brad . Please . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country , and her first year being married and the mistress of a house ; she was going to have her first baby soon , and it was the first time she had ever had anyone , or thought of having anyone , who could remotely be described as a maid . Young Mrs. Hart spent almost hours every day , while she was resting as the doctor told her to , in peacefully congratulating herself . When she was sitting in the rocking chair on the front porch she could look down the quiet street with the trees and gardensand kind people who smiled at her as they passed ; or she could turn her head and look through the wide windows in her own house , into the pretty living-room with the chintz curtains and matching slip-covers and maple furniture ; she could raise her eyes a little and look at the ruffled white curtainson the bedroom windows . It was a real house : the milkmanleft milk there every morning , the brightly painted pots in a row along the porch railing held real plants which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real stove in the kitchen , and Mrs. Anderson was always complaining about the shoe marks on the clean floors , just like a real maid . " It 's the men who make dirt on the floor , " Mrs. Anderson would say , regarding the print of a heel . " A woman , you watch them , she always puts her feet down quiet . Men with their big shoes . " And she would flick carelessly at the mark with the dustcloth . Although Mrs. Hart was unreasonably afraid of Mrs. Anderson , she had heard and read so much about how all house/back of her mind : she could see Robbie shaking the old man 's hand briskly , calling him " sir " and keeping his shoulders back , saying that the old man 's poems were " fine , sir , really magnificent , " promising anything , wildly , just to get away . " You 'll come back in some kind of trouble , " she said mildly . Robbie laughed suddenly , happily . " But he wo n't bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call him up or something . Write him a letter , " she said . " Why ? " She could see that he was pleased with the idea of coming back in trouble , of being irresponsible and what he would call carefree ; he would make the long trip uptown to the minister 's rooming-house by subway and take a taxi for the last two blocks to arrive in style , and sit for a tiresome hour talking to the old man , just to be carefree and what he might call gallant . Make him feel good , she thought . He has to go , not me . " You should n't be trusted to run a business by yourself , " she said . " You 're too silly . " He laughed again and walked around the desk to pat her head . " We get along pretty well , do n't we , Liz ? " " Fine , " she said . He was beginning to think about it now ; he was holding his head up and his voice was filling out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his poems for an anthology , " he said . " Just do n't give him any money , " she said . " He has more than we have now . " He went back to his closet and took out his coat , his good coat today , and threw it carelessly over his arm . He put his hat on the back of his head and picked up his brief case from the desk . " Got all the old guy 's poems in here , " he said . " I figured I could kill some time reading them aloud to him . "  | " Have a nice trip , " she said . He patted her on the head again , and then reached out for the door . " You 'll take care of everything here ? " " I 'll try to cope with it , " she said . She followed him out the door and started into her own office . Halfway across the outer office he stopped , not turning . " Liz ? " he said . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like there was something I wanted to tell you , " he said . " It does n't matter . " " See you for lunch ? " she asked . " I 'll be back about twelve-thirty , " he said . He closed the door and she heard his footsteps going emphaticallydown the hall to the elevator ; busy footsteps , she thought , in case anyone was listening in this fearful old building . She sat for a minute at her desk , smoking and wishing she could paint her office walls a light green . If she wanted to stay late at night she could do it herself . It would only take one can of paint , she told herself bitterly , to do an office like this , with enough left over to do the front of the building . Then she put out her cigarette and thought , I 've worked in it this long , maybe some day we 'll get a million-dollar client and can move into a real office building where they have soundproof walls . The mail on her desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter from a client in Oregon , a couple of ads , a letter from her father , and the bulky envelope that was certainly a manuscript . She threw out the ads and the dentist 's bill , which was marked " Please remit , " set the manuscript and the other letter aside , and opened the letter from her father . It was in his own peculiar style , beginning , " Dearest Daughter , " and ending , " Yr . Afft . Father , " and told her that the **25;4130;TOOLONG one by one , as the weeks passed , the governors began to go out of action . When one failed , automatically the great waternozzlechanged angle and the water flowed through without touchingthe wheel . Then the generator ceased revolving , and sent out no more power . As generator after generator was thus cut out of the system , the strain upon the few remaining ones became greater and greater and the decline of the system became cumulative . When he awoke , he noticed that the lights had faded still more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . He could look at them without hurting his eyes . Now , although he had not turned off any of the lamps , the room was in half-darkness . " The lights are going out ! The lights are going out ! " How often , in how many centuries had those words been said  --  sometimes in matter-of-fact tones , sometimes in panic  --  now literally , now as symbol ? How much light had meant in all the story of Man ! Light of the world ! Light of life ! Light of knowledge ! A deep shiver shook him , but he stilled his panic . After all , he thought , the great system of Power-and-Light had held up for an amazingly long time , all its automatic processes functioning though the men were gone . He thought clear back to that first day when he had come down out of the mountains not yet even knowing what had happened . Then he had passed the powerhouse , and felt the reassurance that everything must still be normalbecause he saw the water pouring out from the tailraces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt again a curious touch of local pride in thinking of it . Perhaps no system had lasted so long . These might well be the last electric lights to be left burning in the world , and when they faded , the lights would be out for a long , long time . No longer sleepy , he sat there , feeling that he should not go to sleep , wishing at least that the end would come quickly and with dignity and not be dragged out too long . Again , he felt the light fading , and he thought , " This is the end ! " But still it lingered , the filaments now only a cherry-red.  |p1o1And  then again they faded . As a sled on a hillside , slowly first , then gaining momentum . Just for a moment , he thought ( or imagined ) , they flared more brightly  --  and then they were gone . Princess stirred in her sleep , then suddenly barked the half-bark of a dream . Was it a death knell ? He went outside . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the failure of some local line . " But he was really sure that it had not been . He peered through the darkness , all the thicker for the smoke that was heavy in the air , changing the moon into an orange ball . He could see no light  --  not along the streets , nor anywhereon the bridge . This , then , was the end . " Let there be no light , and there was no light ! " " No use being melodramatic ! " he thought . Going inside , he stumbled around until he had found the drawer where his mother kept candies . Putting one into a candlestick , he sat again by its feeble but steady and continuing light . Nevertheless he continued to feel a little shaken.  |p102The  fading out of the lights had a strangely severe effect upon Ish . Even in the full daylight , he seemed to feel those ' shadows creeping in from the edges toward him . The Dark Ages were closing in . He found himself hoarding matches and flashlights and candles , piling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection . Yet actually , in a little while , he discovered that the absence of electric light was not really as important to him as the absence of electric power , particularly of refrigeration . The ice-box was dead now , and his food spoiled . In the deep-freeze units the fresh meat , and butter , and heads of lettuce soon relapsed into mere smelling masses of corruption . Now came the change of the season . He was completely lost as to the passage of the weeks and months , but with the geographer'seye he could still tell something about the time of yearp103from the look of things . Now he guessed it must be October , and the first rain came to confirm him ; from the way it settled clown , it seemed likely to last longer than one expected of the first storm . He stayed at home , managing to amuse himself fairly well . He played his accordion . He browsed through several books  --  ones he had always meant to read and now was undoubtedly going to have time to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driftingrain and the clouds low over the tops of the houses . The next day he went out to see what was happening , still thinking of the drama he was prepared to watch . Not so much had occurred , it seemed at first . But after a while he began to notice things . On San Lupo Drive a drain-pipe had plugged with the washing in of all the unswept leaves that lay in the gutter . After the drain-pipe had plugged , the water had swirled across the street to the downhill side and flooded over the curb . The stream of water had worked its way across the tangle of tall grass which had been the Harts ' lawn , and seeped under the door . Their floors and rugs must be soaked , and slimy with mud . Below the house the water had broken out , and run through the rose-garden , leaving a small gully behind it , at last disappearing into the drainageof a storm-sewer on the street below . It was just a little matter , and yet it showed what must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads and drains and walls and thousands of other obstructions to the natural flow of water . These could surviveand function only because men were constantly at hand to repair and clean the thousands of little breaks and blockages which showed up at every change of the weather . Ish himself could have cleaned out that clogged drain in two minutes by merely scraping the leaves back from the grating where they had plugged it . But he saw no point to stretching out his hand . There were thousands , millions , of spots where the same thing must be happening . The roads and the drains and the walls had been constructedonly for man 's convenience , and now that man was gone there was no need of them . The water might just as well follow its natural courses , and cut back through the rose garden . Soaked and muddy , the Harts ' rugs would begin to rot where they lay.  |p104No  matter ! To think of that as something bad , was merely to think in terms of what had once been and no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came upon a large black billy-goat calmly eating the hedge which Mr. Osmer used to clip so carefully . Ish looked at the billy-goat in amusement and in some curiosity , wondering where he could have come from . ( No one kept goats anywhere near such a respectable street as San Lupo . ) The goat desisted from eating the hedge , and looked at Ish . Perhaps , thought Ish , the animal was looking also at the man in amusement and some curiosity . Men now had rarity-value . Having looked for a few seconds , as if it might be equal to equal , the goat again returned to the more profitable business of eating the long shoots which had grown out from the hedge . Doubtlessthey were very succulent . Princess suddenly returned from some expedition of her own , and flew at the strange animal in a frenzy of barking . The goat put down his horns and made a sudden dash at the dog . Princess , who seldom had much stomach for a fight , turned quickly with her rabbit-like dodge , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few minutes later Ish saw the goat walking calmly along the sidewalk , as if lie owned it and all of San Lupo Drive . " Well , why not ? " thought Ish . " Perhaps he does . This is certainlya New Deal . " During this time , when the rain kept him mostly indoors , his thoughts turned a little toward religion , as they had when he walked through the Cathedral . This time he found a large annotatedBible on his father 's bookshelves , and tried browsing here and there in it . The Gospels seemed strangely unsatisfying , probably because they dealt mostly with the problems of a man involved in the social group . " Render unto Caesar . . . " was a strangely unprofitabletext when there was no more Caesar , and not even a Collectorof Internal Revenue . " Sell whatever thou bast , and give to the poor . . . . As ye would that men should do unto you . . . Love thy neighbor as thyself "  --  all these presupposed a functioning society of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Sadducee might perhapsstill follow the set rites of formalized religion , but the very humanity of the teachings of Jesus rendered them obsolete . Turning back to the Old Testament , he began Ecclesiastes , and found himself suddenly more at home . The old fellow " The Preacher "  --  Koheleth , as the notes called him , whoever he might have been  --  had a curious way of striking the naturalistic note , of sensing the problem of the individual against the universe . Sometimesit was almost as if he had imagined what Ish was now experiencing : " And if the tree fall toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree falleth , there it shall be . " Ish thought of that tree in Oklahoma which had fallen to block I Tighway 66 . And again he read , " Two are better than one . . . for if they fall , the one will lift up his fellow , but woe unto him that is alone when he falleth . " And Ish thought of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , and he had felt all too vividly that there would be none to help him up , if he fell . He read through , marveling at the clear-eyed naturalistic acceptance of the universe . There was even a line , " Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment . " He came to the end of the last chapter , and his eyes fell to the lines which began on the lower part of the page . " The song of songs , which is Solomon 's . " He read , " Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth : for thy love is better than wine . " Ish stirred uneasily . In all these long months he had rarely had such feelings . Now again he realized that , more than he thought from day to day , the shock of the whole catastrophe had affected him . It was all like some old story of enchantment in which a king sat and watched life pass by , unable to mingle with it . Other men had done differently . Even those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , been partaking of life . But he himself , in observing what happened , had merely been rejecting life . What made life anyway ? Many people had asked that question  --  even Koheleth , the preacher , was far from the first . And each had come up with a different answer , except those who admitted that no answer could be found . Here was he , Isherwood Williams , a strange mingling ofp1o6realities and fantasies and pressures and reactions , and there all outside was the vast empty city with misty rain falling upon the long empty streets , and the twilight now beginning to deepen . Between the two , him and everything outside him , there lay some kind of strange bond ; as one changed , so the other changed also . It was as if there were a vast equation with many terms on each side , and yet only two great unknowns . He was on one side ; x , perhaps , you could call him ; and on the other side was y  --  everythingwhich was called the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep more or less in balance and never quite managed it . Perhaps the real balance only came with death . ( Perhapsthat was what Koheleth in his fine disillusioned mind was thinking when he wrote " The living know that they shall die ; but the dead know not anything . " ) But , this side of death , the two halves of the equation tried always to be in balance . If the x side changed and he Ish felt within him the pressure of some gland or if he suffered shock or if there was even something so simple as that he grew bored , then he did something , and that changed the other side of the equation , if only a little , and then there was again a temporary balance . But if on the other hand , the world outside changed , if there was a catastrophe wiping out the human race , or if merely it should stop raining , then the x side , being Ish , would also have to change , and that would mean more action , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And who could say whether in the long run one side or the other side of the equation began more of the actions ? Then , before he really thought what he was doing , he had risen to his feet , and on second thought he knew that he had done so because again a feeling of desire had stirred within him . The equation had got out of balance , and he had risen restlessly to set it right again , and already he was affecting the world because Princess had leaped up at his rising and was wandering about the room . Yet at the same time he heard the rain beat a little harder against the window . Then he looked up at it to see what was happening . And so the world had also pressed in upon him and caused him to do something . And after that he set out to get himself some supper.  |p107The  almost complete removal of man , though in some ways an unprecedented earthly catastrophe , had not in the slightest affected the earth 's relation to the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continents , or any other factor influencing the weather . Therefore , the first autumn storm which swept down from the Aleutians upon the coast of California was ordinary and conventional . Its moisture extinguished the forest-fires ; its raindropswashed from the atmosphere the particles of smoke and dust . Behind it a brisk wind swept down cool and crystal-clear air from the northwest . The temperature dropped sharply . Ish stirred in his sleep , and gradually came to consciousness . He was cold . " The other side has changed , " he thought , and pulled up another blanket . He grew warm . " 0 prince 's daughter ! " he thought dreamily , " Thy breasts are like two . . . " And he drifted to sleep . In the morning the house was chilly . He wore a sweater as he got himself his breakfast . He considered building a fire in the fireplace , but the cooler weather had also made him feel more active , and so he thought that he would not stay indoors much that day . After breakfast he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As always after one of these storms , the air was clear . The wind had died down . The red towers of the Golden Gate Bridge , miles away , stood against the blue sky , as if close enough to touch . He turned a little toward the north to look at the peak of Tamalpais , and suddenly started . Between him and the mountain , on this side of the Bay , a thin column of smoke rose straight up through the calm air , a slight wisp , the kind of smoke-column that should come from a small fire , particularly from one burning in a fireplace and ascending through a chimney . It might , he realized , have been risingthere a hundred times before when he had looked out , but in the smoky and misty atmosphere he would not have noticed it . Now it was like a signpost . Of course it might be a fire burning from some natural cause without any human being in its vicinity . He had investigated many smokes like that with no results . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have smothered such fires.  |p108In  any case it could not be more than a couple of miles off , and his first thought was to jump into the station-wagon and investigate . That would cause no more harm than the loss of a few minutes for which he had no particular use anyway . But something stopped him . His attempts to establish human contact had not been rewarding . That old shyness rose up within him , as it had sometimes in the old days when the thought of attending a dance would put him into a sweat . He began to temporize , just as he used to do when he said that he had a great deal of work to do and so buried himself in a book instead of going to the dance . Did Crusoe really want to be rescued from his desert island where he was lord of all that he surveyed ? That was a question that people had asked . But even if Crusoe had been the kind of man who wanted to escape , to renew contacts with other people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was such a person . Perhaps he would cherish his island . Basically , perhaps , he feared human entanglements . Almost in panic , as if fleeing from a temptress , he called Princess , got into the car , and drove off in the opposite direction . He spent most of the clay wandering restlessly through the hills . At times he observed what the rain had done to the roads . By now there was no longer that hard and fast line between road and what was not road . Leaves had dropped from the cold of the autumn and the high winds . Little dead branches had blown off , and fallen on the pavement . Here and there a washing stream of water had left a delta-like deposit of dirt and gravel . Once , very far off , he heard  --  or thought he heard  --  the bay of a pack of dogs . But he did not see them , and before the end of the afternoon he was back home again . When he looked out toward the mountain , he could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of relief , and yet an even stronger sense of disappointment , now that he had a chance to think it over . That was the way . When the opportunity was at your hand , you did not dare to seize it . When the opportunity was lost , it becameprecious . The other side of the equation had changed , and he had adjusted by running away . Of course , he might see thep109smoke again the next morning , but then again he might not . Perhaps that human being , whoever it was , had merely been passing through that way , and could never be found again . Ile felt a quick rebound of excitement , at opportunity regranted , when he looked out in the early darkness after supper , and suddenlysaw a faint but unmistakable light . He hesitated no longer . Now , instead of temporizing , he called Princess , got into the car , and drove in that direction . It was a slow process . His seeing the light must mean merely that the windows of that house happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all before the storm had blown clown most of the leaves . As soon as he left the house , he could no longer see the light . He drove back and forth along the streets for half an hour , finally relocated it , drove slowly down the right street and past the proper house . The shades had been pulled , but there was light shining through , even illuminating the street a little . It was bright , probably from a gasoline lamp . He brought the car to a stop on the opposite side of the street , and waited a moment . Apparently , whoever was inside the house had not heard the motor . For a moment still he hesitated , almostready now to put the car into gear again and slide off undiscovered . Yet , from some deeper drive within him , he leaned forward , and half opened the car door as if to get out . Suddenly Princess leaped by him , and ran toward the house with a fury of barking . She must have scented whoever was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to walk after her . She had tipped his hand , this time , for certain . He hesitated again , suddenlyrealizing he was unarmed . Yet to advance against the house carrying a gun was not a good opening . Without much thought he reached back into the car , and grabbed his old hammer . Hold-ingit in his hand , he advanced after the dog . In the window of the house he saw a shadow move . When he had gained the sidewalk , the house-door opened a few inches , and suddenly the beam of a flashlight caught him . He could see nothing beyond it . He stopped , waiting for what the other person would have to say . Princess scuttled back , suddenly silent . Ish had the uncomfortable feeling that whoever was keep/ing him covered with the flashlight had him covered also with a gun held in the other hand . With the light in his eyes , he was blinded . This had been a crazy thing to do , he thought ; an approachunder cover of darkness always looked suspicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad that he had shaved that morning , and that his clothes looked moderately clean . There was a long pause . He stood waiting for the sharply barked question  --  the inevitable , if slightly ridiculous , " ' Who are you ? " or else for that curt order , " Put up your hands ! " That was why he had a sudden gasp of surprise when a woman 's voice came with an affirmation : " That 's a beautiful dog ! " There was a momentary silence , the memory of the voice in his ears was gentle and low , with a touch of some soft accent in it . At the sound he felt warm feelings rising up within him . Now the light fell from his eyes , illuminating a path ahead of him , and Princess bounded up through the beam of light , her tail wagging in joy . The door of the house moved open wide , and against the dim light behind her , he saw a woman on her knees patting the dog . He walked up toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his hand . Then Princess , in a sudden flurry of excitement , burst away and went tearing into the house . The woman leaped up with an exclamation , half-screamed , half-laughed , and also dashed in . " My God , she must have a cat ! " thought Ish , and rushed after her . But when he arrived in the living-room , Princess was merely dashing around the table and smelling at the chairs , and the woman was standing erect beside a gasoline lamp sheltering it against being overthrown by the excited dog . She was above middle height , brunette , not very young  --  no mere girl , certainly , but a fully developed woman . She glanced at the antics of the scampering dog and laughed , and the sound of laughter was like something remembered from Paradise long ago . She turned to him , and he saw the flash of white teeth in the dark face . Then suddenly a barrier burst within him , and he laughed joyously . After a moment she spoke again , neither questioning nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This time Ish replied , butp111he could think of nothing better than an apology for the ridiculous hammer which still dangled from his hand . " Pardon me for bringingthis thing in , " he said , and he set it down on the floor upon its head with the handle sticking stiffly into the air . " Do n't worry , " she said , " I understand . I went through it too  --  having to have something around to make you feel comfortable . Like a pocket-piece or a rabbit-foot , you remember . We 're still ; shout the same as we used to be , all of us . " After the sudden release of the laughter , he was trembling . All his body seemed growing weak . He felt , almost physically , more barriers breaking  --  those necessary barriers of defense , built up through the months of loneliness and desperation . He must touch another human being , and he put forward his hand in the old conventional gesture of the handshake . She took it , and doubtless as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and almost pushed him into it . As he sat down , she patted his shoulder lightly . She spoke again , once more neither questioning nor commanding : " I 'll get you something to eat . " He did not protest , though he had just eaten heartily . But he knew that behind her quiet affirmation lay something more than any call of the body for food . There was need now for the symboliceating together , that first common bond of human beings  --  the sitting at the same table , the sharing of the bread and salt . Now they were sitting opposite each other . They ate a little , more in symbol than in reality . There was fresh bread . " I made it myself , " she said , " but it 's getting hard to find flour now that 's got no weevils in it . " There was no butter , but honey and jam for the bread , and a bottle of red wine . And now , like a child , he began to talk . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ann on Riverside Drive . Then the barriers had still been up . Now , for the first time , he talked of all those days . He showed even the little scar of the fangs on his hand and the larger scars where he had slashed himself to apply the suction-pump . He told of his fear and of his flight and of the Great Loneliness that he had never quite daredp112face or imagine . And as he talked , she often said , " Yes , I know . Yes , I remember that , too . Tell me more . " As for her , she had seen the catastrophe itself . She had faced more than he had , and yet he could see that she had come through better than he . She talked little , seeming to have no need , but she drew him on . As he talked with her , he knew now at last that this , at least as far as he was concerned , was no mere casual meeting  --  or passingmoment . In this lay all the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and there , and no one before had ever held him . Perhaps time had healed him . More likely , she herself was different . Yet she was a woman . As the minutes slipped by , he sensed that basic reality more and more , with an intensity that made him tremble . As between man and man the breaking of bread was the reality ; the shared table , all the symbol needed . But as between man and woman there must be still more , in reality and in symbol , a further sharing . They realized suddenly that neither knew the other 's name althougheach had been calling the dog Princess . " Ishenvood , " he said . " That was my mother 's maiden name and so she stuck it on me . Bad , was n't it ? Everybody called me Ish ' . " " I 'm Em ! " she said . " Emma , that is , of course . Ish and Em ! We wo n't get very far writing poetry about that combination ! " And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was another sharing ! And yet it was not the final one . There were ways these things were done . He had known men who could do them , had seen them at work . But he , Ish , was not the right kind . All those qualities which had permittedhim to be by himself and survive through the bad days , alone  --  all those qualities now came up to work against him . And he sensed too , very deeply , that they would be wrong . The old methods had worked in the days when there were girls in every cocktail-bar , looking for adventure . But now such methods were not right , he knew , and knew deeply  --  at this time , when the vast city stretched away empty in all directions outside of the windows and all the ways of the world had vanished and this woman hadp113lived through all the catastrophe and the fear and the loneliness and now had come out on the other side , still with courage in her eyes , and affirmation , and laughter . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say some kind of marriage vows . Quakers could marry themselves . Why could n't others ? They could stand up together , and face toward the east where the morning sun would rise . And then he sensed that the mere babbling of words was in itself much more dishnesteven than a straightforward feeling for the knee under the table . He realized that he had been silent for what might have been a full minute . She was looking across at him with level calm eyes , and he knew that she read his thoughts . In his embarrassment he rose suddenly to his feet , upsetting the chair as he got up . Then the table between them had ceased to be a symbol joining them together and now held them apart . He stepped from behind it , and across toward her as she rose up too . And then there was the softness of her body against his . O Song of Songs ! Thine eyes , my love , are gentle , and the fullnessof thy lips is soft and firm . Thy neck is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The softness of thy breasts against me is like fine wool . Thy thighs are firm and strong like the cedars. 0 Song of Songs ! She had gone now , into the inner room . He sat , still with breath and heart quick , tense and waiting . He had only one fear now . In a world where there were no doctors and even no other women , how could anyone risk the chance ? But she had gone . He realized that she , too , in her great affirmation , would consider this also and care for it . O Song of Songs . My love , thy bed is fragrant as boughs of the pine tree , and thy body is warm . Thou art Ashtoreth . Thou art Aphrodite , that keepest the gate of Love . Now my strength is upon me . Now the rivers are pent up . Now is my hour . Oh , receiveme in thine infinitude.  |p114He  lay quietly awake after she slept beside him , and his thoughts rushed by him so fast that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was what she had said before , earlier in the evening  --  no matter what happened to the world , it did not change the person , and he remained what he had been . Yes , that was the way ! Though so much had happened , and even though he might be deeply moved by that great experience , yet still he was the observer  --  the man who sat by the side , watching what happened , never quite losing himself in the experience . The strangeness ! In the old world it might well never have happened . Out of destruction had come , for him , love . He slept . When he woke , it was daylight , and she was gone . He looked around the room fearfully . Yes , it was really a shabby little room , and he suddenly had a fear that perhaps all this seemingly great experience of love was , after all , only something which in the old days would have been no more than a pick-up of a restless waitress and a grimy room in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goddess , no hamadryad glimpsed whitely in the dusk ! Except at the moment of desire , she would never be Ashtorethor Aphrodite . He trembled a little to think of how she might look in the morning light . She was older than he ; perhaps he was merely mixing her in some vague kind of mother-image . " Oh , do n't worry , " he thought , putting it into words , " there never has been perfection yet , and it certainly is n't going to start now for me . " Then he remembered how she had first spoken , not in question or command , but merely in affirmation . Yes , that was the way it ought to be . Take what was good in a situation , not worryingabout what might not be there . He got up and dressed . As he dressed , he sniffed the aroma of coffee . Coffee ! That was a kind of modern symbol , too . She had the table set in the breakfast-nook when he came out , as any commuter 's wife might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He saw again , more clearly by morning light , the widesetblack eyes in the dark face , the full ripe lips , the swelling curve of the breasts beneath a light-green smock . He did not offer to kiss her , and she did not seem to expect it . But they smiled back and forth , one at the other . " Where 's Princess ? " he said . " I put her out for her run . " " Good  --  And it 's going to be a good day , too , I think . " " Yes , looks like it . Sorry there are no eggs . " " No matter . What is it ? Bacon , I see . " " Yes . " They were little words , meaning nothing , yet there was a great joy to say them . A greater joy , perhaps , saying the little things than saying something much greater . A whole contentment came over him . This was no affair of the rented room . His luck was in ! He looked across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage rise up within him ! This would endure ! They moved back , later that day , to the house on San Lupo Drive , chiefly because he seemed to have more possessions  --  books , especially  --  than she did . It was less trouble to move to the books than to move the books to them . The days went more swiftly and more comfortably after that.  |p116There  were many ways of sharing . " What was it ? " he thought . " A friend doubles joys and cuts griefs in half ' ? " She never talked about herself . Once or twice he tried to draw her out with questions , thinking that she might need to tell things . But she did not respond easily , and he decided that she had already made her adjustment in her own way . She had drawn the veil across the view toward the past ; now she looked forward only . Yet she made no apparent attempt at secrecy . He learned from casual remarks that she had been married ( happily , he was sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone to high school but not to college ; her grammar lapsed occasionally . Her soft accent , which he had noticed when she first spoke , had perhaps the touch of Kentucky or Tennessee in it . But she never mentioned having lived anywhere except in California . Her social status must have been , Ish judged , somewhat lower than his . But there was nothing more ridiculous to contemplate , now , than all that business of social classes . " Amazing , how little everything like that matters now ! " And the days slid by easily . One morning , finding that they needed some supplies , he went down to start the car . He put his thumb on the starter button . There was a sudden click , nothing more . He pressed it again , and it clicked . That was all . He heard no sudden comforting whir as the motor took over , no reassuring little bangs as the cold cylinders began to fire . Panic fell upon him again . He pressed the button once more , and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ click . " Battery gone ! " he thought . He got out , raised the hood of the car , and stared hopelessly at the orderly but complex array of wires and gadgets . It was too much for him . He had a sudden hopeless feeling within him ; he went back to the house . " The car wo n't start , " he said . " Battery gone , or something ! " He knew that his face must be even more woebegone than his voice . That was why he could hardly believe it , when she laughed . " There 's no place we have to go so badly as all that , " she said . " To look at you , you 'd think that things had gone to pieces ! "  |p117Then  he laughed too . It made all the difference in the world whether you had that other to cut the grief in half , and the troublesuddenly seemed tiny . A car was convenient when you wanted to go to the stores and load up with some more supplies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was right  --  they had really no place that they needed so badly to go ! He had imagined a desperate day , trying to find a new car or to fix up the old one . As it was , they made it a sport , even though it did take them most of the morning before they located another one . Most of the cars had no keys in them , and while he might have shorted a wire somewhere , they agreed that it would be an inconvenience to have to drive a car without a key . And when they found one with a key in it , the battery , unused now for several months , would not work . At last they found one that had a key in it , and was parked on a hill . The battery was too weak to turn the engine over , but it would burn the lights faintly , and Ish judged that it would send out enough of a current to fire the spark-plugs . They got the car rolling downhill , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and backfire . Ish and Em laughed together happily at the adventure of it . At last the gasolineworked up through the feed-pipes , and the engine warmed , and began to run smoothly . Now they laughed in triumph , and went speeding at sixty miles an hour down the empty boulevard , and Em leaned over and kissed him . And suddenly , queer as it seemed , Ish realized that he had never felt so happy in his life . This car was not such a good one as the station-wagon . Because of this , they used it merely to make some explorations through the warehouse district , checking up in the classified telephone book to locate dealers in batteries . At last they forced the entrance to the proper room and found dozens of batteries with the acid not yet in them . There were also supplies of acid , and although neither of them was mechanically minded , they made the experiment of pouring the acid into a battery of the right size . They took it back , and put it into the station-wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last the motor of the station-wagon hummed tunefully , responding to the pressure of his foot on the throttle , Ish thought that on that day he had met , and faced , two problems . First , he had seen that he could do a great deal toward keeping a car running for a long time . But of even greater importance , he had faced the possibility that there would come a time when there would no longer be any cars , and yet still he could live happily and without fear . The next day , indeed , the new battery in the station-wagon was dead again . Either it was defective or he had made some mistake in installing it . This time , however , he was in no panic . In fact he did not even bother to do anything about it for a couple of days . Then they repeated the process . Either by luck or by greater care , they had better success , and the battery continued to work . Sleek with lacquer , shining with chromium , their motors machinedto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watches , they had been the pride and the symbol of civilization . Now , they were locked ingloriously in garages , or stood in the lots , or were parked at the curb . The dead leaves dropped , the blowing dust settled . The rains fell , and spotted the dust , and made the leaves stick more tightly , and then more dust and more leaves fell . The windshields were so thickly coated that you could scarcely see through them now . More deeply , they changed little . The rust ate here and there , but on the grease-smeared surfaces it could not work rapidly . Unused , the coils and the timers , the carburetors and the spark plugs , all remained as good as ever . In the batteries the slow processes of chemistry worked day and night , breaking down , neutralizing . A few months , and the unused batteries were dead . But as long as the battery and acid were kept separate , neither deteriorated , and it would always be a small matter to add the acid and start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the weakest link . More likely it was the tires . In the rubber the processes of decay worked slowly . The tires would last a year , five years . But neverthe/less , the weakness worked in them . The air leaked from the tires , and after the car had stood on the flat tires for a while , they were no longer of any use . Even in the warehouses , decay worked in the rubber . The stored tires would have ten years , and still some life . Twenty years they would last , perhaps even more . Quite likely the roads , themselves , would be broken and men forget how to drive cars and lose the desire for driving them before the cars themselves were rendered undrivable . Her head rested in the crook of his arm , and he looked down upon the black liquid eyes . They lay on the davenport in the livingroom . Her face looked darker than ever now in the twilight . There was one question , he knew , that they had not yet faced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fine ! " she said . " I do n't know . " " Yes , it would . " " I do n't like it . " " You mean you do n't like it about me ? " " Yes . It 's dangerous . There 'd be no one else but me , and I would n't be any use . " " But you can read  --  all the books . " " Books ! " he laughed a little as he spoke . " The Practical Midwife ? The Pathology of Parturition ? I do n't think I 'd like to face it , even if you would . " " But , yet , you really could find some books and read them . That would be a lot of use . And I would n't really need so much liclp . " She paused a moment : " I 've been through it twice before , you know . It was n't bad . " " Maybe not . But it might be different this time without hospitalsand doctors and all that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it ? " " Biology , do n't they call it , or something like that ? I guess it 's natural . " " Do you think life must go on , we have a duty to the future , all that ? " She paused a minute . He could tell that she was thinking , andp120thinking was not the best thing that she did ; she reacted at deeper levels than those of mere thought . " Oh , I do n't know , " she said . " I do n't know whether life needs to go on . Why should it ? Just as likely I 'm selfish . I want a baby for myself . I mean , oh , I do n't talk this sort of thing well . I 'd like to be kissed , though . " He did it . " I wish I could talk , " she said . " I wish I could tell what it is I think about it . " Then she stretched her arm out , and took a match from the box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , and he expected her to take a cigarette also . But she did not . It was a big kitchenmatch , the kind she liked . She turned it between thumb and finger , saying nothing . Then she scratched it against the box . The matchhead spurted into a flare . Then the fierceness faded out , and the wood of the match-shank burned quietly in yellow flame . Suddenly she blew it out . Vaguely he knew that she , who did not find words easily , had tried  --  perhaps half unconsciously  --  to act out something that she could not say . Slowly he thought that he understood . The match lived , not when it lay in the box , but merely when it burned  --  and it could not burn forever . So too with men and women . Not by denying life was life lived . He thought then of his old fear during the first days and of the time when he had overthrown it , when he had unlashed the motorcyclefrom the tailgate of the station-wagon in the desert and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of exaltationwhich had come when he had offered defiance to death and all the powers of darkness . He felt her body stir gently in his arms . Yes , he thought humbly , that strong courage was his only at great moments  --  with her it was part of daily life . " All right , " he said , " I suppose you 're right . I 'll read the books . " " You know , " she said , " I might need a little more help than that ! " Her body was close and warm against him . Still he held back , feeling all the loneliness and the emptiness and the terror . Who was he to set mankind again on the long and uncertain road top121the future ? But it was only for a moment . Then her courage and the confidence of her courage flowed out from her to him . " Yes , " he thought , " she will be the mother of nations ! Without courage there is nothing ! " And then suddenly he was conscious again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To thee be the glory , because the love of life was brighter beforethy face than the fear of death was dark . Thou art Demeter and Hertha and Isis ; Cybele of the Lions , and the MountainMother . From thy daughters shall spring tribes ; and from thy grandsons , nations ! Thy name is The Mother , and they shall call thee blessed . There will be laughter and song again . Maidens will walk in the meadows ; young men , leap by the brooks . Their children 's childrenshall be again as the pine trees of the mountainside . They shall call thee blessed , because in a dark time thy look was toward the light . While they were still uncertain , Em looked out one morning and said , " See , some rats ! " He looked . Sure enough , two rats were nosing their way along the base of the hedge , foraging about or merely investigating . Em pointed out the rats to Princess through the window , and then opened the door . But being a dog who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was leading , she leaped out baying , and the rats vanished before she was anywhere near them . That afternoon they saw more rats at several times , one place and another , near the house , in the street , or running in the gardens . Next morning the wave had engulfed them . Rats were everywhere . These were merely ordinary-looking rats , no larger or smaller than rats were expected to be , not particularly fat or particularly lean  --  just rats . Ish thought of the way the ants had been some time ago , and felt a cold shiver run through him.  |p122The  only thing to do was to make an investigation , and thus render the rats less horrible , because when you knew something about the situation , you saw the interest that lay in it . In the station-wagon they drove about here and there , often crushing some rat which decided to dash across the street , just ahead of their tires . At first they shuddered a little at the soft squash , and looked at each other , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing about it . The area which the rats were occupying was roughly the city , although they spread outward from the built-up area , covering somewhat larger an area than the ants had done . What had happened , in general , was clear enough . Ish remembered some kind of statistics which declared that the number of rats in a city was generally about equal to the number of people . " Well , " he explained to Em , " you start then with , say , a million rats , half of them being does or bitches or whatever you call lady rats . Some of the stores and warehouses are rat-proof , but still there has been for all this time what you can call an unlimited supply of food . " " Then how many rats should there be now ? " " I ca n't do that problem in my head . I 'll try later . " That evening at home he sat clown to it as a mathematical problem . With the aid of his father 's encyclopedia he determined that rats had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ten young . That is , one month of uninterrupted breeding might have produced about a population of ten million rats in this given area . These young females , in turn , would begin to breed before they reached the age of two months . There must be some casualties , of course , and he had no way of determining just how many of the rats would live to maturity . But , certainly the increase must be prodigious under the circumstances . His mathematics broke down . But even if the rats should only be increasing at the rate of doubling their numbers every month , an estimate which seemed ridiculously conservative , there should by this time be already somewhere in the neighborhood of fifty million . If they were increasingthreefold each month , an estimate which still seemedp123conservative , there would now be in the area approximately one billion rats . As he considered the problem , he saw no reason at all why the rats , with unlimited food , might not possibly quadruple their numbers every month . In the Old Times man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rats , and even man had had to maintain constant war against them to keep their numbers under control . With man gone , their only enemies would have been the small number of dogs whose instinct led them to catch rats , and somewhat larger number of cats . But here a secondary result must have influenced the situation in favor of the rats . As he had noticed , the rat-catching dogs seemed to hold the ground alone without the help of any cats . Probably the dogs had killed the cats as much as they had the rats , and so had eliminated the chief control . And in the end , the dogs themselves had probablybeen overwhelmed in the mere increase of numbers . Now he no longer saw any dogs . It seemed unlikely that they had actuallybeen killed by the rats , although the rats may very well have cleaned out many litters of puppies . Probably , the dogs had merely retreated before the swarms of rats , and were still hanging around on the outskirts , now having been driven from the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or only fifty million made very little difference . There certainly were too many rats , and Ish and Em felt themselvs in a state of siege . They watched all the doors carefully . Nevertheless , one rat appeared in the kitchen from some unknown quarter , and they had a mad scurry as Ish pursued it with a broom . Cornered , it leaped viciously at the broom-handle , and left teeth marks in the hard wood before he was able to crush it against the floor . After a few days , moreover , they began to see a kind of difference , both in the appearance and in the behavior of the rats . Apparently , the supplies of food , vast though they were , had at last begun to yield before the attack of an ever-pyramiding numberof rats . The rats now appeared thinner , and they ran around even more feverishly in search of food . They began to burrow in the ground . They dug up the tulip bulbs , first of all , seeming par/ticularly fond of them . Then they attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the branches of the trees , apparently eating any insects they could find or any remains of seeds or fruit . They even , at last , began to gnaw the bark of young trees , like rabbits . Ish parked the car as close to the house as he could now , and made a dash for it , wearing high boots . But actually the rats never made any attempt at an attack . Ish kept Princess in the house mostly , although the rats had offered her no violence either . Still driving about to investigate , Ish became more and more accustomed to the soft squash beneath his tires . He began to feel as if he were plastering the streets with a continuous line of crushed rats . In the angle of two walls , as he drove slowly by , a small white object caught his attention . Stopping the car and looking carefully , he saw that it was the skull of some small dog . The long teeth , still shining white , indicated that it had probablybeen a terrier . Apparently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls ; or else , the dog , fighting for its life , had retreated there . Whether the rats had dared attack a strong and healthy dog , Ish could not know . Perhaps it had suffered an accidentor had been chewed up in a fight with another dog . Perhaps it was old or sick . But apparently , for once , the swarm of rats had been too much even for the ratter . Ish saw only a few of the larger bones ; the rest had apparently either been gnawed to pieces or dragged away . In the vicinity , he saw also the skulls of several rats , indicating that the terrier had gone down fighting . He tried to imagine the scene . The swarming gray bodies clambering all over the struggling dog , the dog unable to attack those which hung to its back . Others must have slashed at the hamstrings like wolves attacking an old bison-bull . Though the dog might kill a dozen or fifty , in the end the mad , hunger-frenzied rodents must have gnawed through the skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the spot feeling definitely sober , and deciding that they must keep an even more careful watch on Princess . He remembered , hopefully , that the ants had vanished almostp125overnight , and he kept expecting that something like that also might happen to the rats . But there was no indication of it . " Arc the rats going to take over the world ? " Em asked . " Now that men are gone , are the rats going to be next ? " " Of course I do n't know for sure , " said Ish , " but I hardly think so . They 've got a head-start because they know how to use the food-supplies in the city and because they breed fast . But once they get away from the city they 'll have to forage on their own , and the foxes and snakes and owls are going to build up too becauseman is gone and because they 'll have lots of rats to feed on . " " I never thought of that ! " she said . " You mean rats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kill off their enemies . " " More like parasites on man , I suppose really . " And then , just to be saying something to keep her interested , he ran on : " And speaking of parasites , of course rats have them too . Just like the ants ! When anything gets too numerous it 's likely to get hit by some plague  --  I mean  --  " ( Something had suddenly exploded in his mind at the word . ) He coughed to cover up his hesitation , and ! hen went on , without making a point of it . " Yes , some plague is likely to hit them . " Em , to his relief , did not seem to have noticed . " All we can do then , " she said , " I guess , is to sit around and cheer for the rat 's parasites . " Ish did not tell her what had disturbed him . It was the realization that not just plague in the general sense , but bubonic plague was a common epidemic among rats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and those infected fleas readily hopped from dead rats to living people . The thought of being among the few people left in an area inhabited by millions of rats being killed off by bubonic plague was a horrible situation to contemplate . He began to deluge the house with DDT and spray it upon his clothing and Em 's . Naturally then she became suspicious , and he had to tell her . She was not disturbed . Her natural courage rose superior to cV en the thought of plague , and perhaps there was a vein of fatalismin her too . The simplest and safest thing would have beenp126to hurry out of the city , and get to some place  --  the desert , perhaps  --  wherefew rats could live . But each of them had already decided independently that life was not to be lived on the basis of fear . Her courage indeed was stronger than his , and the horror of the rats pressed in more closely upon him . Occasionally he even felt panic and was ready to force her into the car for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flow out from her and sustain him . As the days passed , he watched individual rats carefully to see if they seemed sickly . On the contrary , they seemed more active than ever . Then Em called to him one morning from the window . " Look , they 're fighting ! " He went to look , quickly , but without too much interest . Probably , he thought , it was merely whatever kind of sex-play rats indulged in . But it was not . He saw a large rat definitely attacking a smaller one . The small one fought back , and dodged desperately , and seemed just about to make its escape through a hole which might be too small for the larger one . Then suddenly a third and still larger rat appeared , and sprang also upon the small one . The little pool of blood spread out from the torn throat , and then the largest rat dragged the body away , the one who had made the original attack scurryingclose after . In high boots , well gloved , carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedition to the nearest business-center and foraged for some more food . Curiously , to him , he found very few rats in the stores , and when he investigated , he found that everything which a rat could get and eat had been completely wiped out . The stores were a great disgusting litter of torn papers , and chewed cartons and rat-droppings . They had even chewed the labelson the cans and bottles , so that sometimes it was difficult even to tell what was contained in them . Certainly , as yet , starvationand not disease was closing in upon the hordes . He took the news back to Em . Next morning they let Princess out for her daily run . ( They had been allowing her out only once a day as a matter of precaution . ) After a few minutes they heard her wild howling , andp127she came tearing hack to the door with rats skirmishing all around her , and two or three actually clinging to her back . Opening the door they let her in , and necessarily admitted three or four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a flurry of howling . Deserted by the cause of the disaster , Ish and Em spent a lively quarter hour routing out the rats and killing them . They hunted the house most carefully , aided by a now partially recovered Princess , to find whether any rat was still lurking in a closet or behind the books of the bookcase . But they decided that they had killed them all . They kept Princess shut up , after that , out of necessary precaution , and they also muzzled her for fear of hydrophobia . By now they were quite sure that the rats were preying one upon another . Sometimes they saw a large rat pursuing a smaller rat , and sometimes it seemed as if several banded together in a pack to attack a single one . They seemed less numerous now , but that might be because they were keeping out of sight under the new conditions . To Ish the whole affair , in spite of a certain horror that he still held of it , came to be a most interesting study in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first lived upon the stores of food which men had laid up for them , and these had gradually been transformed into a great reservoir of rat-flesh . Then , when the cereals and dried fruit and packaged beans were depleted , there was left  --  for certain individual rats at least  --  this other supply of food . Under such circumstances , it seemed a question whether any single rat would die of starvation , even though the rats as a species might be dying of starvation . " The old and sickly and weak and immature will go first , " he said , " and then those that are not quite so old or sickly or weak or immature  --  and so on . " " And eventually , " said Em , who sometimes showed disconcertinglogic , " there 'll just be two great strong rats left to fight it out  --  like ( what was it ? ) the Kilkenny cats ? " Ish explained that before such a fate ensued the rats would have become so scarce that they would again have begun to forage upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw that the rats were not actually destroying the species for their own individual preservation ; they were really saving the species . If the rats had been sentimentaland had decided that they would all starve together without indulging in cannibalism , then indeed there might have been some danger . But rats were realists , and so their racial futureseemed secure from this emergency . Day by day , the numbers of rats became fewer , and then one morning they seemed to be gone entirely . Ish knew that there still must be many rats in the city , but what had happened was merely what would happen in the decline of any species . Under natural circumstances , the rats kept out of sight , liking narrow passageways and holes and brush-filled gullies . Only when their numbers became so great that they could not all find such refuges did they spill over and inhabit the open places where they could be seen . Doubtless , at the end , disease may have helped , but he was never sure of this . One great advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rats left around . They had gone on to preserve the species into the next generation . Also , lie knew , although he did not investigate , that the rats must have clone a great deal toward removing the bodies of the human beings who had died in the original disaster . As he collected his thoughts upon the subject , he was surprised that there had been no plague of mice . The ants had come first , and then had come the rats . Between the two there should have been a rapid increase of mice , because the mice should have had almost as good an opportunity as the rats and because their breedingrate was even faster . He never learned the answer , but merely had to suppose that some control of which he knew nothing had acted to prevent the rapid increase of mice . Both Ish and Em took a little while to recover from the horror with which the rats had filled them . But after a while they decided that Princess had not contracted hydrophobia . They loosed her , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant crawling of the gray bodies.  |p129The  fables were wrong . Not the Lion , but Man , was the King of Beasts . Throughout his reign the rule was heavy , often harsh . But though the cry rise up , " The King is dead ! " it shall not go on : " Long live the King ! " As in the old days when some conqueror died , leaving no tall son , and the captains strove together for the scepter and none proved strong enough and the realm fell apart , so it shall be again , for neither the ant nor the rat nor the dog nor the ape is wise enough above his fellows . For a little while there will be jostlings , quick rises and sudden falls ; then , a quiet and a peace such as the earth has not known in twenty thousand years . Again her head lay in the crook of his arm , and he looked down into the dark eyes . She spoke . " Well , you 'd better get busy at that book-work now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly before he could say anything , he felt her tremble and she was crying . He had not thought this of her  --  this fear ! He felt the sudden weakness of his own terror . What if she collapsed ? " Oh , darling , " he cried out . " Maybe we can still do something ! There are ways . You must n't try to go through with it ! " " Oh , it 's not that ! It 's not that ! " she cried out , still trembling . " I lied . Not what I said , what I did n't say ! But it 's all the same . You 're just a nice boy . You looked at my hands , and said they were nice . You never even noticed the blue in the half-moons . " He felt the shock , and he knew that she felt the shock in him . Now everything came together in his mind  --  brunette complexion , dark liquid eyes , full lips , white teeth , rich voice , accepting temperament . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisper , " It did n't matter at first , of course . No man cares then about that . But my mother 's people never had much luck in the world . Maybe when things are starting out again , it should n't be with them . But mostly , I guess , I think it was n't right with you . " Then suddenly he heard nothing more , for the whole vast farce of everything broke in upon him , and he laughed , and all he could do was to laugh and laugh more , and then he found that she ,  |p130too  , had relaxed and was laughing with him and holding him all the closer . " Oh , darling , " he said , " everything is smashed and New York lies empty from Spuyten Duyvil to the Battery , and there 's no government in Washington . The senators and the judges and the governors are all dead and rotten , and the Jew-baiters and the Negro-baiters along with them . We 're just two poor people , pickingat the leavings of civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the ants or the rats or something else will get us . Maybe a thousand years from now people can afford the luxury of wondering and worrying about that kind of thing again . But I doubt it . And now there are just the two of us here , or maybe three , now . " He kissed her while she still was weeping quietly . And he knew that for once he had seen more clearly and more deeply , and been stronger than she.  |p131On  the day after she had told him , he drove to the University campus , and parked in front of the Library . He had never entered it since the Great Disaster , although he had often gone to the city library for books . The great building stood undisturbed . Its surrounding bushes and trees had not , in the few months , grown appreciably taller . The drain pipes all seemed to 1 ) e functioning perfectly , and no stain of water showed on the white granite walls . There was only a general impression of dirt and litter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance by breaking a window , thus giving access to animals and also to the rain . In the end , however , he could find no other way . He tapped gently with his hammer , and managed to break only a part of a pane , reaching through , he unlocked the window and raised it . After all , he told himself , he could bring some boards and patch the window again , so that it would still be ratproof and weatherproof.  |p132He  had been in the Library hundreds of times before , as a matter of course , during his years at the University . But now under the changed conditions , he felt a strange new sense of awe . Here rested in storage the wisdom by which civilization had been built , and could-be rebuilt . Now that he knew himself soon to be a father , he had suddenly a new attitude , a feeling for the future . The child should not grow up to be a parasite , scavenging forever . And it would not need to . Everything was here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some books on obstetrics , but after looking into the main reading-room and then wandering through two levels of the stacks , he became so excited that he left the building in a frenzy of imagination . He did not need to worry about the obstetrics today . There was plenty of time still for that . He drove home in a kind of trance . Books ! Most of the knowledgewas in books , and yet he soon saw that they were not all . First of all , there must be people who could read , who knew how to use the books . He must also save other things . Seeds , for instance . He must see to it that the more important domestic plants did not vanish from the earth . Suddenly he felt that all civilization depended not only upon men but also upon these other things which had marched with him like kinsmen and friends and companions . If Saint Francis had hailed the sun as brother , might not we also say , " Oh , Brother Wheat ! Oh , Sister Barley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could go on : " Oh , Grandfather Wheel ! Oh , Cousin Compass ! Oh , Friend Binomial Theorem ! " All the discoveries of science and philosophy also might be imagined as standing shoulder to shoulderwith man , even though the putting of the matter into words made it all sound a little ridiculous . He hurried , still hot with boyish enthusiasm , to tell it all to Em . He found her trying , not at all successfully , to teach Princess to retrieve . Em was not as enthusiastic as he had expected . " Civilization ! " she said . " Oh , you mean airplanes going higher and higher , and faster and faster . That kind of thing ! " " Oh , yes . But art , too , you know . Music , literature , culture . "  | " Yes , mystery-stories and those funny Negro jazz bands that always made my ears hurt . " He was crestfallen , even though he knew she was having a little fun with him . " Another thing , though , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of time . We do n't really know what month it is . We 'll want to be sure when his birthday comes , so that we can celebrate it , something less than two years from now . " Perhaps , he felt in his mind , that was the difference ! That was the difference between woman and man . She felt only in terms of the immediate , and was more interested in being able to spot her child 's birthday than in all the future of civilization . Again , he felt superior to her . " One thing I did n't do , though , " he said , " was to read any of those obstetrics books today . I 'm sorry  --  but there 's no hurry , is there ? " " Oh , no . Maybe not even any use of it at all . Do n't you remember that even in the Old Times babies were always being born in taxis and hospital lobbies ? Once they 're started , nobody can stop them . " Later , when he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had made a suggestion of something important . The more he thought about it , the more fundamental he considered her idea of keeping track of time . After all , time was history , and history was tradition , and tradition was civilization . If you lost the continuity of time , you lost something that might never be recovered . Probably it had already been lost unless some of the other ' survivors had been more careful about the matter than he had been . Take the seven-day week , for instance . Even though you were not religious , you had to admit that the seven-day week with its one day of rest was a fine old tradition of mankind . It had been going on for at least five thousand years , clear from Babyloniantimes , and no one knew how much further . Would he ever be able to figure out again just which day was Sunday ? As for getting the proper day of the year , that should not be too diffi'cult . He knew enough about the fundamentals of astronomyto do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct , hep134could figure back on last year 's calendar and perhaps re-establish the day of the week . This was the time of the year to get busy on the problem . Althoughhe did not know exactly , he could tell from the progress of the weather and from his general knowledge of how much time had elapsed since the catastrophe , that it must have come now pretty well toward the middle of December . If the solstice was to be in a week or so , he could easily tell by watching where the sun set . Next day he found a surveyor 's transit , and although he did not know much about the use of it , he set it up on the porch , facing the west . He blackened its lenses with soot , so that he could observe the sun without hurting his eyes . His very first observation showed that the sun was going down behind the hills of San Francisco , to the south of the Golden Gate . From memory he knew that this was very near to its most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position , and recorded the angle of the sunset . The next evening it set still a little farther south . And then , as systems do , his system went to pieces . A heavy storm blew in from the ocean , and during a whole week he could not observe where the sun set . Next time he saw it , it had already started north . " Well , anyway , " he said , " we must be pretty close to it . If we add one day to the time when we last saw the sun , we ought to be very near to the solstice , and then if we add ten days to that , we would get to New Years . " " Is n't that rather silly ? " she said . " Why ? " " Well , I mean , that is , should n't the year really start when the sun turns north again ? Do n't you guess really that was what people tried to do once , and things got mixed up some way or other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , I imagine it was that way . " " ' Well , why do n't we just start our New Year then with  --  what you call it ?  --  the solstice ? It seems simpler . "  | " Yes , but you ca n't just go fooling with the calendar . That 's been established for a long time . You ca n't just shift it . " " Well , did n't someone named Julian do it , and were n't there riots and things ? But still , they did change it . " " They did change it ! Yes , you 're right  --  and I suppose we can change it now if we want to . It certainly gives a person a sense of power ! " Then in playfulness of imagination they decided that living where they did , they had a system all worked out before them , so that they would not even bother to have months and things like that unless they wanted to , because from the hill they could see the sun setting around its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the sun set in the middle of the Gate , or the time it had reached the first big hump to the north , or the time it had begun to reach the various points along the long slope of the mountain . What was the use of merely having months ? " Say ! " she said , suddenly , " it must be pretty nearly Christmas , too . I had n't thought of that . You think I can get down before the stores close to pick you a tie ? " He looked back at her with a little smile . " I suppose we ought to feel pretty lugubrious this Christmas , and yet , some way , I ca n't . " " Next year , " she said , " this ought to be even more fun . We 'll have to get him his first tree . " " Yes , and he can have a rattle , too , ca n't he ? What I 'm looking forward to , though , is when he can get an electric train , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I guess there 'll never be an electric train for him . Maybe , though , when we have grandchildren , in twenty-five years , maybe , we 'll be able to get the electricity working again . " " Twenty-five years ! I 'll be a pretty old woman by that time . It 's strange , thinking forwards now , as well as backwards . For a while , I only thought backwards . But that thinking ahead brings up something else to my mind , also  --  the years ! We 'll have to keep track of the years . Do n't people on desert islands cut notches in trees or something like that ? You see , he 'll want to know whatp136year it is ; so he can vote or get a passport , or report to his draft board , maybe . Only perhaps , you are n't going to restore things like that for us in this new civilization . What is this year , anyway , now ? " Again he thought that was like a woman , to put even such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unborn child . But yet , as so often , her instinct was right  --  a great pity if the historical record should be broken at some point ! Doubtless in the long run , archeologists could restore the continuity by means of varves or dendrochronology , but it would save a lot of work if someone merely kept the tradition . " You 're right , " he said . " And it 's simple , too , of course . We know what year it is now , and when we decide we 've come to New Years , we 'll just chisel a new date on some good rock , and then every year chisel the next one . The chiseling will be quite a job , and so we 'll always remember whether we are up-to-date or not . " " Is n't that rather silly , too ? " she said . " I mean , starting out with a date in four figures . As far as I 'm concerned , " she paused for a moment and looked around with that quiet air which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm concerned , this past year might as well be the Year One . " That evening there was no rain . The clouds still hung low , but the air was clear beneath them . You could have seen the lights of San Francisco , if there had been any lights . He stood on the porch , and looked out toward the dark west , breathing the cool damp air in deeply . His mood was still close to exaltation . " Now we have finished with the past , " he thought . " These last few months , the tag-end of the year  --  we shall let the past have them . This is the Moment Zero , and we stand between two eras . Now the new life begins . Now we commence the Year One . The Year One ! " Now there lay before him no longer the mere drama of a world without men and of its constant adaptation . No longerp137would personal readjustment be his own dominating problem . Now there stretched away in the years ahead , the unfolding drama of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And now he would not be the lonely spectator , at least , not merely that . He could read . He was equipped with the background of much knowledgealready . He would extend that into technics , into psychology , into political science , if that were needed . There must be others that he could find also to join with them  --  good people who would help in the new world . He would start looking for people again . He would look craftily , trying to keep away from all those who had suffered too much from the shock , whose minds or bodies were not what one wanted to build up the new society . Somewhere within him there lingered still that one deep fear that she might die in childbirth , that the whole hope of the future might thus fade . And yet , he could really not fear it very deeply . Her courage burned too brightly . She was life . He could not associate her with death . She was the light for the future , she and those that would spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her children shall call her blessed ! " He himself would have had only the courage to live on , feeling death creep in closer year by year as once the darkness had crept in from the corners of the room when the lights were failing . Her stronger spirit had struck back against death , and already life built up anew within her . From her depths courage flowed out to him . It was curious , doubtless even illogical , that the thought of the coming child should make so much difference . But he granted the difference . He had known despair , but now he knew hope . He looked forward with confidence to the time when the sun would again be setting at the southern end of its long arc and the two of them  --  or the three  --  would go to carve into some rock the numeral commemorating the end of the Year One . It was not finished . The thing would go on . A phrase leaped into his mind . " Oh , world without end ! " he thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west over the empty city , breathing deeply of the cool damp air , the words sang in his mind , " Oh , world without end ! World without end ! " Here ends Part I. The inter-chapter called Quick Years follows , after a time-interval of one year.  |p139Not  far from the house on San Lupo Drive there was that area which had once been a small public park . Tall rocks rose picturesquely , and at one place the tops of two of them leaned together , forming a high narrow cave . Near by , a smooth rock-surface , as large as the floor of a small room , sloped with the hillside , but was not too steep to sit on comfortably . In those older times which had been before even those that were now called the Old Times , some tribe of simple people had lived thereabouts , and on the smooth rock-surface you still saw the little holes where those people had pounded with stones to make their acorn-mash . One day , after the round of the seasons had passed and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south of the Golden Gate , Ish and Em climbed the hillside toward the rocks . The afternoon was calm and sunny , warm for mid-winter . Em carried the baby , wrapped in a soft blanket . ( She was pregnant again , although not yet heavy on her feet . ) Ish carried his hammer and a cold-chisel.  |p140Princess  started with them , but as always went baying off on the trail of one of her rabbits . When they came to the rock , Em sat down on it in the sun and nursed the baby , and Ish worked with hammer and chisel , cutting into the smooth surface the single numeral . The rock was hard , but with the heavy hammer and the sharp chisel , he soon finished an upright line . But it was fun to adorn the work a little , and some ceremony seemed fitting to mark the end of their first full circuit of the sun from south back to south . So Ish cut a clean serif at the base of the line , and a little hook at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat 1 which he remembered in the times of printing . When he was done , he sat close beside Em in the sun . The baby had finished feeding , and was happy . They played with him . " Well , " said Ish , " that was the Year One ! " " Yes , " said Em , " but I think I shall always remember it as the Year of the Baby . Names are easier to remember than numbers . " Thus from the very beginning it came about that they called each year not so often by its number as by a name based on something that had happened during that time . In the spring of the second year , Ish planted his first garden . He had never liked gardening , and that probably explained why , in spite of good resolutions and two half-hearted attempts , he had not grown anything during the first year . Nevertheless , as he turned over the dark moist soil with the spade , he felt a deep satisfaction at being in touch again with primeval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the garden . To begin with , the seed ( he had had a hard time to find any at all because of the ravages of the rats ) was several years old , and much of it failed to sprout . Snails and slugs soon moved in , but by scatteringa box of Snale-Killa he eliminated them , and felt triumphant . Then , just as the lettuce was making a good growth , a buck jumped the fence and wrough havoc . Ish put another layer on the top of the fence . Next , some rabbits burrowed beneath  --  more destruction , and more work ! One evening he heard crashing noises and rushed out just in time to scare off a predatory cow onp141the point of smashing a way through the fence . More work ! By this time he was waking up at night with thoughts of raveningdeer , rabbits , and cattle prowling around his fence and ogling his lettuces with eyes that gleamed like tigers ' eyes . Then , in June , the insects arrived . He sprayed poison until he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any lived to be harvested . The crows were the last to find the garden , but when they arrived in July their numbers made up for their late arrival . He stood guard , and shot some of them . But they seemed to post sentries and swoop down as soon as his back was turned , and he could not watch during all the daylight hours . His scarecrows and dangling mirrors kept them off for a day , but after that they lost their fear . In the end he actually erected a shelter of fly-screen over the few rows of garden which seemed worth saving , and he harvested a little lettuce , along with some scrawny tomatoes and onions . But he conscientiously let some of the plants go to seed , and saved the fresh seed for the future . He was as thoroughly discouraged as any amateur gardener had ever been . It was one thing apparently to grow vegetables when thousands of others were doing the same , and quite another when yours was the only plot and so from miles around every vegetablehungryanimal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or oozing or hopping , and apparently sending out by signals to its fellows the universal shout , " Let 's eat ! " Toward the end of summer the second baby was born . They called her Mary , just as they had decided finally to call the first one John , so that the old names would not vanish from the earth . When the new baby was only a few weeks old , there was anothermemorable event . This was the way of it . . . . In those first years though Ish and Em stayed contentedly close at home , they now and then had visits from wanderers who had seen the smoke on San Lupo Drive and headed for it , sometimes in cars , more often on foot . These people , with one exception , seemed to be suffering from shock . They were bees who had lost the hive , sheep without ap142flock . By now , Ish concluded , the ones who had made a good adjustmentmust already have settled down . ( Besides , no matter whether the wanderer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three's-a-crowd reared up . ) So Ish and Em were glad when one of these restless and unhappy people decided to continue wandering . The exception was Ezra . Ish always remembered how Ezra came strolling along the street that hot September day , his face florid , his half-bald head even redder , his jaw narrow and pinched , his bad teeth showing suddenly when he saw Ish and stopped and smiled . " Hi-ya , boy ! " he had said , and though the words were American , still behind them somewhere was the ghost of a North-of-England accent . He stayed until after the first rains . He was always pleasant , even when his teeth were growling . He had that inexpressibly great gift of making people feel comfortable . The babies always smiled for Ezra . Ish and Em would have urged him to stay permanently , but they feared the triangle-situation , even when the outsider was as easygoing and perceptive as Ezra . So one day when he seemed restless they sent him off , telling him jokingly to find himself a pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sad after he had gone . At the time of his leaving the sun was again far to the south . So , when they went to the flat rock and cut the numeral 2 , Ezra was still in their minds , though he was gone and they did not expect to see him again . He would have been , they thought , a good helper , a good person to have around . To his memory they called it the Year of Ezra . The Year 3 was the Year of the Fires . Just after mid-summer the smoke suddenly drifted over everything , and it stayed , lighter or heavier , through three months . The babies sometimes woke up coughing and choking , their eyes watering . Ish could realize what was happening . The western forests were no longer primeval woodlands of big trees through which a firep143could sweep and do little damage . On the contrary , because of logging and man-caused fires , the forests consisted mostly of thick and highly inflammable second-growth , made all the worse by slash-piles and brush-fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was dependent upon him , surviving only because of his vigorous efforts at fire-suppression . Now the hoses lay neatly coiled and the bull-dozers reddened with rust , and in this summer , a very dry one , over all northern California , and doubtless in Oregon and Washington too , the lightning-set fires were raging uncombatted through the tangled second-growth and blazing up in the tinder-dry slash-piles . One horrible week they even saw the fires burning brightly in the night , all along the north side of the Bay , sweeping the slopes of the mountain from bottom to top , and dying out only when there was nothing left to burn . The broad arms of the Bay fortunately kept the fire on the north side , and there were no lightning storms on the south side to start new fires . When it was all over , Ish believed that there must be very few forests left unburned in California , and centuries would be required to grow them again . In this year also Ish really settled down to reading  --  another sign that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books from the City Library , and kept the million volumes of the Universityas a great reserve to be tapped when the time was ripe . Althoughhe often thought that he should use his reading to make himself skillful in such fields as medicine and agriculture and mechanics , he found that what he actually wanted to read was the story of mankind . He plunged through innumerable volumes of anthropology and history , and went on into philosophy , particularlythe philosophy of history . He read novels and poems and plays , which also were the story of mankind . Sometimes in the evening , when he was reading and Em was knitting , and the babies were asleep upstairs and Princess was lying lazily in front of the fire  --  sometimes then Ish would look up and think that his father and mother had passed many evenings in just the same way . But then he would see the gasoline lamp and turn his eyes up to the dead electric-light bulbs in the ceilingfixture.  |p144The  Year 4 was the Year of the Coming . . . . One day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barking wildly and " dashed for the street , and then they heard a car-horn tooting . Ezra had been gone for more than a year , and they had stopped thinking about him . But there he was  --  in a jalopy-looking car , overflowing with people and household goods . Ish could n't help thinking of an Okie outfit arriving in California in the Old Times . Besides Ezra , there crawled out of the car a woman of about thirty-five , a younger woman , a frightened-looking half-grown girl , and a little boy . Ezra introduced the older woman as Molly , and the younger as Jean , and after each name he added calmly and without embarrassment , " My wife . " Ish suffered only mild shock at the fact of bigamy . He had been through a great many experiences already , and he reacted quickly to realize that plurality of wives had been an accepted part of many great civilizations in the past and might well be again in the future . It was certainly a practical situation when there were two women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like Ezra , able to live comfortably with people under all sorts of conditions . The little boy was Ralph , Molly 's son . He had been born only a few weeks before the Great Disaster , and had presumably either inherited immunity or absorbed it through his mother 's milk . This was the only case , so far as they knew , of two members of the same family surviving . The half-grown girl they called Evie , but nobody really knew her right name . Ezra had found her living in squalor and solitude , opening cans to find what she needed , grubbing for worms an . snails . She must have been five or six years old at the time of the Great Disaster . Whether she had always been half-witted , on whether the shock of death and solitude had rendered her so , no one knew . She cowered and whimpered , and even Ezra could wia smile from her only now and then . She knew a few words , an . after they had been kind to her for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she never grew normal . Later in the same year Ish and Ezra went off together for a fedays in Ish 's old station-wagon . The trip was not a pleasant one ;  |p145they  had tire-trouble and engine-trouble , and the roads were rough . Nevertheless they accomplished what they had set out to do . They located George and Maurine , whom Ezra had found on one of his wanderings . George was a big shambling fellow , gray around the temples , good-natured , uncertain in speech but deft in his trade , which was carpentry . ( " Too bad ! " thought Ish . " A mechanic or a farmer would have been better for us ! " ) Maurine was his female counterpart , except that she was some ten years younger , around forty probably . She loved housekeeping as George loved carpentry . As for their mental processes , you might call George dull , but you would have to call Maurine stupid . Privately Ish and Ezra discussed George and Maurine , and decided that they were good solid people , comfortable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakness . ( It was a little , Ish thought wryly , like deciding whether you would give someone a bid to your fraternity , and when there were so few to choose from , you could n't be too choosy . ) In the end George and Maurine came along back in the station-wagon . Ish and Maurine found that they had one experience in corn-:non . As a little girl in South Dakota , she had been bitten by a rattlesnake . Toward the end of this year Em bore her second son , whom hey named Roger . So by that time the people living on San Lupo rive numbered seven adults , and four children , and Evie bedes . About then they began , at first as a joke , to talk of themIvesas The Tribe . The Year 5 supplied no very startling occurrence . Both Molly nd Jean had babies , and Ezra was as pleased as a two-time father should be . In the end they called it the Year of the Bulls . This as because there was a plague of cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all remembered the plagues of the ants and the Its . Cattle had gradually got to be more and more numerous . cry rarely did anyone see a horse ; never , a sheep . But it was good country for cattle , and they reached a climax in this year , and became a nuisance . To be sure , you easily got all the steak you tinted , though it was tough . But you had continual trouble run/ning into a cross bull when you were merely wanting to walk her . or there . You could always shoot a bull , but shooting one near the houses either meant that you had to go to all the trouble o burying the carcass , or of dragging it away , or else you suffered , from the smell . They all had to become adepts at stepping quickl out of the way when a bull charged , and they came to make some thing of a sport of this , and to call it " bull-dodging . " The Year 6 was an eventful one . During its course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had seemed too old . There was , however  --  now that Em had led the way  --  a strong drive toward the having of many children . Each of the adults had for a time lived alone , had experienced what they now called the Great Loneliness , and the strange dread that went with it . Even now their little group was only a tiny candle against the pressure of surrounding darkness . Each new-born baby seemed to give the uncertain flame a stronger hold and to push the darknessof annihilation back a little . At the end of this year the num ber of children , which was ten , exceeded the number of adultsand then of course there was Evie , who was hardly to be counte. in either group . But it was an eventful year for other reasons too . It was a year of drought and of little grass , and the too numerous cattle grew thin and wandered everywhere , searching food . Driven madly by hunger , they crashed the strong fence around the little vegetableplot one night . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range , but before they could be driveoff , the garden was utterly ruined  --  ironically , by being trample ( out , for in the confusion of the milling herd no animal had bee able to eat . To crown all this , came the grasshoppers . They descended sud denly , and ate up everything that the cattle could not reach . The ate the leaves from the trees and the flesh from the ripening peaches , so that the bare seeds hung from the ends of the leaflets , branches . Then the grasshoppers died , and their stench was everywhere . After a while the cattle also lay dead by hundreds in the drp147stream beds and muddy waterholes , and their stench too filled the air . By now the land was stripped bare , as if it would never recover . A horror fell upon the people . Ish tried to explain to them thatit was all a part of the jostling for readjustment after the loss ofhuman controls . There was bound to be , for instance , a plague ofgrasshoppers during the first year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not disturbed by cultivation . ut with the stench in the air and the whole earth looking dead , could not be very convincing . George and Maurine took to . ycr . Jean made fun of them openly , saying that what had hapnedin the last few years did n't give her confidence in this godbusiness . Molly went into depressions , and wept loudly at times . n spite of his rationalistic explanations even Ish was despondent . r the future . Of the adults only Ezra and Em showed the pacity for taking things as they came . The older children seemed to be little affected . They gulped cir canned milk greedily , even when the stench was thickest . John ( they already were calling him Jack ) held his father 's hand with confidence , and looked with mild six-year-old interest at a w which had tottered along the street and lay dying in the sun . c obviously accepted it as just part of his world . But the nursing babies , except Em 's , absorbed a sense of disas-r through their mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the more , they set up a vicious circle . October was a month of horror . Then came the miracle ! Two weeks after the first rain they ked out , and the hills were a faint green with sprouting grass . cryone was suddenly happy , and Molly and Maurine wept with asure . Even Ish was relieved , for in the last weeks the despair the others had shaken his confidence in the basic recuperative  --  wcrs of the earth itself , and he had begun to doubt whether y seed remained . When , at the time of the winter solstice , the people all gath-d once more at the smooth expanse of rock to cut the numeral to the surface and to name the year , they were uncertain what y should call it . It might be , for good omen , the Year of thep148Four Babies . But it might be the Year of the Dead Cattle , or th Year of the Grasshoppers . In the end the evilness of the ye . prevailed in their thoughts . So they called it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also . The mountain-lions suddenly seemed to be everywhere . You hardly dared to walk betwee houses without carrying a rifle , and having a dog at heel to gi warning , and the dog kept usually very close at heel also . The lions never quite dared attack a man , but they picked up fou dogs , and you were never quite sure whether one of them migh not just suddenly leap from a tree . The children had to be kep indoors . What had happened was again obvious enough to Ish During the years when there had been so many cattle , the lion must have bred rapidly , and now that the cattle had perished i the drought , the lions were left without food and ravenously were closing in . In the end there was bad luck , because Ish missed his shot an . instead of killing a lion merely raked it across the shoulders , an . it charged and mauled him before Ezra could get another she home . After that he walked with a little limp , and became very tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in drivin a car . ( But by now the roads had gone to pieces badly and th cars were unreliable and there were few places to go anyway , s that there was very little car-driving . ) Naturally , they called it th Year of the Lions . The Year 8 was comparatively uneventful . They called it t Year We Went to Church . ( The name amused Ish , for its wording implied that that experiment was over and done with . ) This had happened in this way .... Being merely seven ordinary Americans , they were of varied religious affiliations or s none at all , and even among the church-members no one ha felt any creative religious drive . Ish had gone to Sunday-schoola child , but when Maurine asked him what church he belonge to , he had to say that he was a skeptic . Maurine did not know tl word , and jumping to the wrong conclusion she always referred to Ish thereafter as being a member of the Skeptic Church.  |p149Maurine  herself was a Catholic , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Hail Mary , but otherwise they were in a bad situation , having no confessor and no way of celebrating mass . As Ish reflected , the Catholic Church had considered almost ell possibilities , but apparently never the one of getting reorganizedafter the Apostolic Succession was broken and only two women remained . Of the others , George had been a Methodist , and a deacon . ut he was too inarticulate to turn preacher , and not enough of a adcr to organize a congregation . Ezra was tolerant of everyone 's beliefs , but never let himself be pinned down as to his own , andprobably lacked any convictions . Jean had been a member of Inc loud-praying modern sect called Christ 's Own . But she had en the congregation pray in vain at the time of the Great Disas- , and now she had turned definitely anti-religious . Em , who vcr liked to turn toward the past , was reticent . As far as Ish could tell , she never prayed . Now and then , apparently without inking of religious implications , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Maurine , sinking the Methodist-Catholic differices , were the ones who suggested church services  --  " for the sake f the children . " They appealed to Ish , who was something of a ader , especially in things intellectual . Maurine , broad-mindedly , en told him that she would not object to the use of " the Skeptic nn of services . " Ish felt the temptation . He could easily piece together some unless bits of religion , give comfort and confidence to people ho might often need it badly , and supply a core of solidity and ion to the community . George , Maurine and Molly would welcome it ; Jean should be easy to convert again ; Ezra would not lid in the way . But Ish himself hated building upon a foundation of insincerity , and he knew that Em would see through the sham .. In the end they held a service each Sunday  --  George had kept ck of Sunday , or at least thought so . They sang hymns , and read nt the Bible , and stood uncovered for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayed during the period of silence , and he di not think that Em or Ezra did either . Moreover , Jean maintained . her hostility stoutly , and never attended . Ish felt that if he ha . had more fervor , or more hypocrisy , he could have argued Jea over . As it was , however , the church services were cultivating di union rather than unity of feeling , and sham more than tru ' religion . One day , on the spur of the moment , Ish put an end to them He did it rather neatly , he thought , ending his speech with the , idea that they were not really giving up the services but merel extending the period of silent prayer indefinitely  --  " letting each one of us carry on in his heart as he wishes . " Molly wept a little at what seemed to her such a lovely thought , and so the experiment with church at least was ended in harmonyAt the beginning of the Year 9 there were seven adults , an . Evie , and thirteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Molly 's Ralph , who was nine , and Ish 's and Em 's Jack , who was eight . Everybody had a pleasant sense of confidence and security i the growth of the community , or of The Tribe , as they now said more often . The birth of each baby was a time of real rejoicing. , as the shadows seemed to draw back a little and the circle of light to enlarge . Soon after the beginning of that year , a decent-looking oldis man came up to George 's house one morning . He was one . those wanderers who still occasionally , though less and less ofte passed through . They received him hospitably , but like the others he showe little reaction to what they did for him . He stayed only over on night , and then went off again , without even saying good-bye , i the aimless way of those shocked ones . He had scarcely gone , it seemed , before people began feelin irritable . All the babies started crying . Then soon there were so throats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Tribe was suddenly in all the throes of an epidemic . This was all the more remarkable because throughout the prp151ceding years the general health had been so unbelievably good . Ezra and some of the others had suffered with bad teeth ; George , who was the oldest , had complained of various aching joints which he described under the old-fashioned term " rheumatism " ; occasionally a scratch became infected . But even the common cold seemed to have vanished entirely , and there were only two diseases that remained active . One of these struck each of the children sooner or later ; it was a great deal like measles in its symptoms , and doubtless it was measles , and that was what they called it , lacking any doctor to make them sure . The other began with a violent sore throat , but yielded so quickly to sulfa pills that no one really knew its full course . As long as there were sulfa pills in any drug store and they kept potent in spite of age , Ish saw no need to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if left untreated . Why so few diseases remained  --  this seemed miraculous to peoplelike George and Maurine , and they were inclined to be superstitiousabout the matter . They felt that God in some great anger had nearly wiped out the human race in one vast plague , and thus being satisfied , had seen fit to remove the minor plagues as u kind of compensation  --  just as , after Noah 's flood , he had set the rainbow in the sky as a sign that there would never again be anothersuch flood . To Ish , however , the explanation was plain . Since so large a roportion of the people had died , the chain of most infections ad been broken , and many individual diseases had , you might v , " died " when their particular kinds of bacteria became extinct . F course there would still be the diseases which might spring om the mere deterioration of the human body , such as heartfluteand cancer , and George 's " rheumatism , " and there might Ish be animal-borne infections , like tularemia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , individual survivors who carried me disease in chronic form , but could still pass it on to others , 1st as some one of themselves had probably been responsible for lie survival of " measles . " The old man , everyone remembered too late , had blown his se occasionally . Doubtless he had an infected sinus , and so hadp152infected them all with what used to be called " the common cold , " ' although lately it had been so uncommon as to seem extinct . In any case there was something almost comic in the way so many disgustingly healthy people were suddenly transformed into sneezers and coughers and hawkers and nose-blowers . Fortunately , the cold ran its course without complications , and in a few weeks everyone was well again . Throughout the rest of that year Ish lived in fear of another outbreak . There was a good chance , he knew , that the infection might be quiescent in one of them , and then break loose again when the short-time immunity of the others had worn off . But the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped everyone to throw off the last vestiges of the infection . That was great luck ! Ish had been highly susceptible in the Old Times . He had sometimes said , not altogether as a joke , that the loss of the common cold compensatedfor the accompanying loss of civilization . That autumn , however , the good luck ran out . No one ever knew exactly what happened , but three of the children fell ill with violent diarrhoea , and died . Most likely they had been wanderingabout at play in one of the near-by uninhabited houses , and had found some poison  --  ant-poison , perhaps . Tasting it curiously they had found it sweet , and shared it . Even when dead , civilizationseemed to lay traps . One of the children had been Ish 's own son . He had always worried , not about himself , but about Em , in such a case . Yet , though she mourned for the child , he saw that he had under estimated her strength . Her hold on life was so strong that , paradoxically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Both Molly and Jean , the other bereaved mothers , grieved hysterically , and were much more stricken . That year two children were born , but nevertheless the total number of The Tribe for the first time was smaller at the end than at the beginning of a year . They called it the Year of the Deaths . The Year 10 had no remarkable events , and no one was con vinced as to what it should be called . But when they sat on thep153flat rock and Ish poised his hammer and began to cut with the chisel , for the first time some of the children spoke up , and they said it should be called the Year of the Fishing . This was because during this year they had discovered that the bay was swarming with beautiful striped bass , and they had had a great deal of fun going fishing and catching them . Besides supplying a very fine variety to the diet , the fishing had also been a real source of amusement to everybody . But in general , Ish was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the kind of life that they lived there always seemed to be a good deal to do just to get food and to support oneself in comfort and there was in it a great deal of satisfaction which did not call for anything as definite as amusement . In the Year 11 , Molly and Jean bore children , but Molly 's died at birth . This was a great disappointment , because it was the first one that they had lost at childbirth , and in the course of the years the women had become very skillful at helping one another . They thought that perhaps this death was caused from Molly 's being old now . When it came to naming the year , however , there was a disputebetween old and young . The older ones thought it should be called the Year when Princess Died . . . . She had been ailing , an old dog , for some time . No one knew just how ancient she was , because she might have been anywhere from one year to three or four when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same  --  always the princess , expecting the best of treatment , alwaysunreliable , always ready to disappear on the trail of an imaginaryrabbit just when you wanted her . But for all you might say against her , she had shown a very real character , and the older people could remember the time when she seemed very important along San Lupo Drive , almost another person . By now there were dozens of dogs around . Nearly all of them trust be children or grandchildren or great-grandchildren of Princess , who on various occasions had disappeared for a day or two and apparently met an old friend among the wild dogs or picked up a new one . As the result of a lot of in-breeding and out-breed/ing and cross-breeding , these present dogs were very little like beagles , but varied tremendously in size and color and temperament . But to the children Princess had been an old and not very interestingdog of uncertain temper . They said that this should be the Year of the Wood-Carving , and after a momentary hesitation Ish supported them , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . She had taken him out of himself in those first bad days and let him free himself of fear , and her wild barking dash had taken him into the house where he found Em , when otherwise he might have hesitated and driven on . But also , he thought , Princess was over and done with , and only a link with the past , to be remembered by people who were growing older and older . Soon the younger children would not remember her at all . After a while she would be wholly forgotten . ( Then the icy thought came to him : " So too I may grow old , and older , and be merely a link to the past , and be an unregarded old duffer , and then die and be soon forgotten  --  yet that is as it should be ! " ) Then , as the others argued , he thought of the wood-carving . It had swept over them as a kind of fad or craze , like bubbleblowingor mah-jongg in the Old Times . Suddenly all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft sugar-pine , and were trying to carve running designs of figures of cattle or dogs or people . They worked awkwardly at first , but soon some of them grew skillful . Though , like all fads , it had fallen off , still the childrenworked at it on rainy days . Ish had studied enough anthropology to know that any healthy people should have creative outlets , and he was worried that The Tribe had not developed artistically but was still living under the shadow of the past , listening to old records on the wind-up phonographsand looking at old picture books . Accordingly he had been pleased at the fad for wood-carving . At a pause in the argument he spoke up , supporting the children . So it came to be known as the Year of the Wood-Carving , and in Ish 's mind the Year 11 had a symbolic value , as a breaking with the past and a turning to the future . Yet the naming was ap155small matter , and he was not sure that he should attach any significanceto it . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Em made up for it by bearing the first pair of twins , whom they called Joseph and Josephine , or more commonly , Joey and Josey . So this was the Year of the Twins . The Year 13 saw the birth of two children who both lived . It was a quiet and comfortable year , with nothing to mark it especially . So , for lack of anything better , they merely called it the Good Year . The Year 14 was much like it , so they called that the Second Good Year . The Year 19 was also excellent , and they considered calling it the Third Good Year , but there was a difference . Ish and the older people again felt that first loneliness and the drawing in of the darkness . Not to grow more numerous was essentially to grow fewer , and this was the first year since the very beginning when there had been no children born . All the women  --  Em , Molly , Jean ' and Maurine  --  were now getting old , and the younger girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Evie , the half-witted one , who should never be allowed to have children . So they did not like to call this the Third Good Year , because it was not wholly good . Instead , the children remembered that this year could be thought remarkable because Ish had got out his old accordion and to its wheezing they had sung songs together  --  old songs like Home on the Range or She 'll Be Comin ' Round the Mountain , and so they called this , at the children 's prompting , the Year That We Sang . ( No one except Ish seemed to think that anything was wrong with the grammar . ) The Year 16 , however , was remarkable because the first marriageactually took place . Those married were Mary , who was Ish 's and Em 's oldest daughter , and Ralph , who had been bornp156to Molly just before the Great Disaster . They were younger than would have been thought suitable or even decent for marriage in the Old Days , but in this also standards had changed . Ish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even sure that Mary was especially fond of Ralph , or Ralph of Mary . But everyone had always assumed that the two of them would get married because there was nobody else available whom either of them could take , just as it once was with princes and princesses . So perhaps , as Ish concluded , romantic love had merely been anothernecessary casualty of the Great Disaster . Maurine and Molly and Jean were all for " a real wedding , " as they said . They hunted up a Lohengrin record for the wind-up phonograph , and were making a wedding costume in white with a veil , and everything to go with it . But , to Ish , all this seemed a horrible parody of things that had once been ; Em , in her quiet way , supported him . Since Mary was their daughter , they controlledthe wedding . In the end , they had no ceremony at all , except that Ralph and Mary stood before Ezra , and he told them that now they were being married and that they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must try to fulfill it well . Mary bore a child before the year was out , and so for that reason , it was called the Year of the Grandchild . The Year 17 they called , mostly at the children 's prompting , the Year the House Busted . The reason was that one of the nearbyhouses had suddenly collapsed and crashed down with a great noise just in time for some of the children to see it as they came running out at the first crack . On investigation , the matter proved simple enough , because termites had had a chance now to work in the house for seventeen years undisturbed , and had eaten through the underpinning . But the incident had made a great impression upon the children , and so it gave the name to the year , although it was not really a matter of importance . In the Year i8 , Jean bore still another child . This was the last of all that were born to the older generation , but by this timep157there were two marriages of the second generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the Year of the Schoolteaching . . . . Ever since the first children had been old enough , Ish had tried , in a more or less desultory way , to give them some kind of teaching , so that they could at least read and write and do a little arithmetic , and know something of geography . But it had always been difficult to get the children together , and there seemed to be so many things that they wanted to do , either in play or in earnest , and the schoolteaching had never accomplished very much , althoughmost of the older children could read after a fashion . At least they had once been able to read , but Ish doubted whether some of them  --  such as Mary , who was now a mother with two babies  --  could at the present moment do more than spell out words of one syllable . ( Though she was his own beloved oldest ( laughter , he admitted to himself that Mary was not intellectual  --  no need to say she was stupid . ) In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get together all of the children who were of proper age , so that they would not grow up completely ignorant . It worked for a while , and then again it lapsed , and it was hard to say whether he had accomplished anything or not , and he felt a sense of frustration . The Year 19 was named the Year of the Elk , again because of a little incident which impressed the children . One morning some of them saw Evie , now grown to be a woman , looking out and pointing and crying excitedly in her strange voice , which did not quite form words . When they looked , they saw that she was pointingat a new kind of animal . This turned out to be an elk , which was the first one that they had seen in all these years . Apparently , the herds had now increased enough so that they had worked down from the north and were coming back into this region , where they had lived before the arrival of white men . There was no question about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The old San Leandro Fault stirred again , and early one morning there was a sharp jolt and the sound of falling158p158chimneys . The houses in which they all lived stood the shock , becauseGeorge always kept them in excellent repair . But the houses that had been weakened by termites or undermined by washing water or damaged by rot came crashing down . After that there was hardly a street which was not littered here and there with brick or with other debris , and because of damage from the earthquake deterioration began to accelerate . The Year 21 Ish had though they might call the Year of the Coming of Age . They now numbered thirty-six  --  seven of the older ones , Evie , twenty-one of the second generation , and seven of the third . In the end , however , this year was named , like many others , from a small incident . . . . Joey was one of the twins , who were the youngest of the children born to Ish and Em . He was a bright boy , though small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of those who were even younger than he . He got a certain favoring from both his father and mother , because he was , with his twin , the youngest . On the whole , however , in such a large group of children , nobody had paid him any great attention , and now he was nine years old . But just at the end of this year , they suddenly discovered to their great amazement that Joey could read  --  not only could read in the slow , halting way of the other children , but could read quickly and accurately and with pleasure . Ish felt a suddenwarming of his heart toward the youngest son . This was the one in whom the light of intellect really was still burning . The other children also were much impressed , and so at the ceremony they cried out that this should be called the Year When Joey Read . End of the inter-chapter called Quick Years . There must be in their social bond something singularly captivating , and far superior to anything to be boasted of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we have no examples of even one of those Aborigines havingfrom choice become Euro-peans ! J. Hector St. Johnde Crc vecoeur , Letters from an American Farmerp161After the ceremony at the rock was over and the numerals 2 and 1 stood out sharply and freshly cut on the smooth surface , the people started back toward the houses . Most of the children scuttled ahead , calling back and forth , eager with ideas about the bonfire which traditionally ended the New Year celebration . Ish walked beside Em , but they talked little . As always at the date-carving Ish felt himself thinking deeper thoughts than usual and wondering what would happen in the course of the year . He heard the children shouting out : " Go to the old house that fell down ; you can pull off lots of dry wood there . . . . I think I can find a can of gasoline . . . . I know where there is toilet paper ; it burns fine . " The older people , as was the custom , gathered at Ish 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation . Since it was a time for festivity , Ish opened some port , and they all drank toasts , evenp162George , who ordinarily did not drink . They agreed again , as they had at the rock , that the Year 21 had been a good year and that the prospects for the coming one were good also . Yet in the midst of the general self-congratulation , Ish himself felt a renewed sense of dissatisfaction . " Why , " he thought , feeling the words flow through his mind , as if he were arguing aloud , " why should I be the one who in times like this always has to start thinking ahead ? Why am I the one that has to think , or try to think , five years or ten years , or twenty years into the future ? I may not even be alive then ! The people who come after me  --  they will have to solve their own problems . " Yet he knew , as he thought again , that this last was not alto- ' gether true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , he realized , either to create or to solve the problems for the cople who come in the generations later . In any case , he could not help wondering what would happen to The Tribe in the years that were ahead . It worried him . After the Great Disaster , he had thought that the people , if any survived at all , would soon be able to get some things running again and proceed gradually toward re-establishing more and more of civilization . Iie had even dreamed of a time when electric lights might go on again . But nothing like that had happened , and the communitywas still dependent upon the leavings of the past . Now he looked around , as he had often looked before , at the ones who were with him . They were , so to speak , the bricks out of which a new civilization must be fashioned . There was Ezra , for instance . Ish felt himself growing warm with the mere pleasure of friendship as he looked at that thin ruddy face and pleasant smile , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius perhaps , but it was the genius of living on easy and friendly terms with people , and not the creative drive that leads toward new civilizations . No , not Ezra . And there beside Ezra was George , good old George  --  heavy and shambling , powerful still , though his hair had turned wholly gray . George was a good man , too , in his fashion . He was a first-class carpenter , and had learned to do plumbing and painting and thep163other odd jobs around the house . He was a very useful man , and had preserved many basic skills . Yet Ish always knew that George was essentially stupid ; he had probably never read a book in his life . No , not George . Next to George , was Evie , the half-witted one . Molly kept her well groomed , and Evie , blonde and slender , was good-looking , if you could forget the vacantness of her face . She sat there glancingright and left at whoever was talking . She even gave an illusionof alertness , but Ish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what was being said . She was no foundationstonefor the future . Certainly , not Evie . Then came Molly , Ezra 's older wife . Molly was not a stupid person , but she had had little education and could certainly not be called intellectual . Besides , like the other women , she had expendedher energy at bearing and rearing children , and now five of hers were still alive . That was enough contribution to ask of anyone . No , not Molly . Beyond Molly , the next person was Em . When Ish looked at Em , so many feelings boiled up within him that he knew any judgment he might try to make of her would be of no value . She , alone , had made the first decision to have a child . She had kept her courage and confidence during the Terrible Year . She it was to whom they all turned in time of trouble . Some strong power lodged within her , to affirm and never to deny . Without her they might all have been as nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action ; in a particular situation , though she might inspirecourage and confidence in others , she herself seldom supplied an idea . Ish knew that he would always turn to her and that she was greater than he , but he also knew that she would not be of help in planning toward the future . No  --  though it seemed disloyaltyto say so  --  not even Em ! Beyond Em , lolling on the floor , were Ralph and Jack and Roger , the three who were still called boys , even though they themselves were married and had children . Ralph was Molly 's son who was married to Ish 's daughter , Mary ; Jack and Roger were Ish 's own sons . But as he looked at them now , Ish felt very far from them , even though his connection by family was as close as could wellp164be . Though he was only some twenty years older , still he seemed separated from them by centuries . They had not known the Old Times , and so they could not look forward much and think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probably not the boys either . Ish 's eyes had moved around the circle , and he was looking now at Jean , Ezra 's younger wife . She had borne ten children , and seven of them were still alive . She had a mind of her own , as her refusal to join in the church-services had shown . Still , she was not a personof new ideas . No , not Jean . As for Maurine , George 's wife , she had not even bothered to come to the gathering , but had gone directly from the rock to her own house , where she would already be engaged at sweeping or dusting or some other of her perpetual and beloved tasks of housewifery . Of all persons , certainly not Maurine . Three other adults also were not present . They were Mary , Martha , and young Jeanie , who were married to the three boys . Mary had always seemed to Ish the most stolid of all his children , and now with her own children coming so fast , she grew a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were mothers , and motherhood was absorbing them . No , none of these . Present and absent , twelve adults ! He still had difficulty in realizingthat there was no vast reservoir of humanity from which to draw . Half a dozen children were interspersed among the adults or circled around restlessly on the outside of the circle . Instead of going to help with the bonfire , these few had kept with the adults  --  half-bored , and yet apparently thinking that such a large gatheringof their elders was important and should be watched . Ish let his attention shift to them , speculatively . Sometimes they listened to what the older people were saying , and sometimes they merely poked each other or scuffled . Yet , in them , careless as they seemed , rested the hope . The older people could probably slide along on the present arrangements as long as they lived , but the children might have to adapt . Could any of them supply the spark ? And now , as he began to focus on the children , Ish saw that onep165of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , steadily listening to what the older ones were saying , his big eyes glancing back and forth with a bright glow of intelligence and interest . This was Joey . No sooner had Ish 's eyes focused for a moment upon Joey , than Joey 's alertly wandering glance noticed the attention his father was giving him . He squirmed with delight , and his face broke into the all-embracing grin of a nine-year-old . Upon the impulse of the moment , Ish winked slyly at his youngest son . Joey 's grin could scarcely have become any broader than it was , but in some way it seemed to spread . Ish caught the flutter of an eyelid in return . Then , not to embarrass Joey , Ish turned his glance elsewhere . There was a slow argument going on among George and Ezra and the boys . Ish had heard it all before , and was not enough interested to participate or even to listen to all of it . " One of them things do n't weigh more'n four hundred pounds anyway , I think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jack replied . " But just the same , that 's a lot to lug up here . " " Aw , that 's not so much ! " said Ralph , who was heavy-set and powerful , and liked to show off his strength . And so , thought Ish , the argument would go on , as he had heard it often before , about whether it was possible to get a gasrefrigeratorsomewhere , and set it up , and supply it with still charged tanks of pressurized gas , and so have ice again . Yet , in the end , nothing would be done , not because the project was impossibleor even inordinately difficult , but merely because everybody was fairly well contented with things as they were , and in a region of notably cool summers there was no great drive which led anyoneto want to have ice . Yet , in a vague way , the old argument disturbed him . He let his gaze shift back to Joey . Joey was small , even for his age . Ish enjoyed watching the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eves shifted from one speaker to another , never missing a point . In fact , Ish could see that Joey often picked up the point of a sentence , even before the speaker arrived at the end of it , especially with a slow speaker , like old George . This must be , Ishp166reflected , a tremendous day for Joey . A year had actually been named after him , the Year When Joey Read . No other child had ever had any such honor as that . Perhaps it was even such a distinctionas to be bad for him . Yet , the idea had come spontaneouslyfrom the other children , a tribute to sheer intellect . The languid argument was still going on . George was talking now : " No , there should n't be no great trick to connecting up the pipes . " " But , George , " this voice was Ezra 's with its quicker tempo and faint tone of Yorkshire still noticeable after all these years , " has gas-pressure kept up in those tanks of compressed gas ? I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ezra 's voice trailed off that moment at a sudden rumpus between two of the children . Weston , Ezra 's own twelve-year-old son , was engaged in a punching contest with Betty , his half-sister . " Stop it , Weston , " Ezra snapped out . " Stop it , I say , or I 'll warm your pants for you ! " The threat did not carry conviction , and as far as Ish could remember , he had never seen the easygoing Ezra punish a child . Nevertheless , at the paternal order the scuffle subsided with no more than the conventional protest from Weston , " Aw , Betty started it ! " " Yes , but what do you want ice for anyway , George ? " This was Ralph speaking . It was a natural and never-failing phase of the argument . The boys , who had never known what it was to have ice , had no urge to make them go to the work of obtaining it . Ish was thinking to himself that George had been asked that question a great many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really should have had his answer ready , but George was not a quick thinker and was not a man to be hurried . He shifted his tongue in his mouth , shaping words before he actually set out to reply , and in the pause Ish again watched Joey . The little boy 's glance moved quickly from the hesitant George to Ezra and to Jack , as if to see how those others were taking the pause ; then Joey 's eyes sought his father 's again . All at once there was a quick comradeship and sense of understanding in the glance . Joeyp167seemed to be saying that either his father or he would find an answer quickly and not hesitate as George was doing . Then something exploded inside Ish 's brain . He did not hear the words that at last began to unroll slowly from George 's mouth . " Joey ! " Ish was thinking  --  and the name seemed to reverberate all through his consciousness . " Joey ! He is the one ! " " Thou knowest not , " Koheleth wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the womb of her that is with child . " And though the centuries have passed since Koheleth looked upon all things and found them fickle as wind , yet still we know little of what goes to the making of a man  --  least surely of all , why usually there issue forth only those who see what is , and why rarely , now and then , there comes forth among them the chosen one , Child of the Blessing , who sees not what is , but sees what is not , and seeing thus what is not , imagines also what may be . Yet without this rare one all men are as beasts . First in the dark depths and the flooding , those unlike halves must meet that carry within them each the perfect half of genius . But that is not all ! Also the child must be born to the world in fitting time and place , fulfilling its need . But even that is not all . Also the child must live , in a world where death walks daily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the infinitesimal chance will happen , and there will be greatness and vision . But how will it be , if the people are broken and scattered , and the children only a few ? Then , almost without knowing what had happened , Ish found himself on his feet . He was talking . In fact , he was making a speech . " Look here , " he was saying , " we 've got to do something ; shout all this . We 've waited long enough ! " As he stood there , he was only in his own living-room , and he was talking only to the few people who were there . He knew that they were only a few , and yet it seemed to him not so much as if he were talking just to these few in this little room , but rather that he was in some great amphitheater and talking to a whole nationor to all the people of the world.  | " This has got to stop ! " he said . " We must n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the supplies that the Old Times left here for us , not creating or doing anything for ourselves . These things will all give out some day  --  if not in our years , in our children 's , or grandchildren 's . What will happen then ? What will they do when they wo n't know how to produce more things ? Food , they can get , I suppose  --  there will still be cattleand rabbits . But what about all the more complicated things we enjoy ? What , even , about building fires after the matches have all been used , or spoiled ? " He paused , and looked around again . They all seemed pleased , and seemed to be agreeing with him . Joey 's face was transcendent with excitement . " That refrigerator you were talking about just now , all of you ! " Ish went on . " That 's an example . We talk about it , but we never do anything . We 're like that story  --  that old king in the old story  --  the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could never make any move to break the spell . I used to think we were just suffering from the shock of the Great Disaster . Perhaps that was it , in those first days . When people have their whole world go to pieces around them , they ca n't expect to make a fresh start immediately . But that was twenty-one years ago , and many of us have even been born since that time . " There are lots of things we should do . We should get some more domestic animals , not just dogs . We ought to be growing more of our own food now , not just raiding the old grocery stores still . We ought to be teaching the children to read and write more . ( No one has ever supported me strongly enough in that . ) We ca n't go an scavenging like this forever , we must go forward . " He paused , searching for words by which to point out to them the old truism that unless we go forward we inevitably go back , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished . He thought that he had really swayed them by a sudden flood of eloquence , but then he realized , as he looked around , that the applausewas largely in good-natured irony . " That 's the fine old speech again , Dad , " Roger remarked . Ish glared at him angrily for a moment ; having really been the leaderp169of The Tribe for twenty-one years , he did not like to have himself put down thus as merely an old codger with some funny ideas . But then Ezra laughed good-naturedly , and everybody joined in the laughter , and the tension fell off . " Well , what are we going to do about it then ? " Ish asked . " I may have made the same old speech before , but even if I have , it 's true , nevertheless . " He paused expectantly . Then Jack , who was Ish 's oldest son , unlimberedhimself from where he was lolling on the floor , and got to his feet . Jack was taller and much more powerful than his father now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry , Dad , " he said , " but I 've got to go . " " What 's the matter ? What is it ? " Ish snapped back to him , a little irritated . " Well , nothing so very much , but there 's something I have to do this afternoon . " " Wo n't it wait ? " Jack was already moving toward the door . " I suppose it might wait , " he said , as he put his hand on the door knob . " But I think I 'd better be going anyway . " There was silence for a moment , except for the sounds of the door opening , and shutting , as Jack went out . Ish felt himself suddenly angry , and he knew that his face was flushed . " Go on talking , Ish , " Ish heard the voice , and knew through his anger that it was Ezra 's . " We would like to hear just what you think we ought to do ; you have the ideas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ezra as usual was saying something quickly to cover up the difficulty and make people feel better . He was even flattering Ish . Nevertheless , at the voice , Ish relaxed . Why should he be angry with Jack for acting independently ? He should , rather , be happy . jack was a grown man now , no longer a little boy and merely a son . The flush faded from Ish 's face , but still he felt a profound sense of trouble within him , and he was led on to talk more . If the incident could do nothing else , at least it could supply him with a text . " This business with Jack right here now , that 's something Ip170want to talk about , too . We 've drifted along all these years not doing anything about producing our own food and getting civilizationback into some kind of running-order , as regards all the materialthings . That 's one matter , and an important one , but it is n't the only one . Civilization was n't just only gadgets and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts of social organization too  --  all sorts of rules , and laws , and ways of life , among people and groups of people . The family  --  that 's all we have left of all that organization ! That 's natural , I suppose . But the family ca n't be enough when there get to be more people . When a little child does something we do n't like , the father and mother correct it , and bring it into line . But when one of the children grows up , that 's all over . We have n't any laws  --  we are n't a democracy , or a monarchy , or a dictatorship , or anything . If someone  --  Jack , for instance  --  wants to walk out on what seems to be a kind of importantmeeting , nobody can stop him . Even if we take a vote here and decide to do something , even then , there 's no means of enforcement  --  oh , a little public opinion , perhaps , but that 's all . " He had trailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conclusion . He had been speaking more from the emotional drive that Jack 's move had aroused in him . He was not a trained orator , and had certainly no practice . Yet , as he looked around , he saw that the speech had apparently made a very good impression . Ezra was the one who spoke first . " Yes , you bet ! " he said . " Do n't you remember all of those wonderfultimes we used to have back in those days . Golly , what would n't I give just now to be over there with George 's big radio and turn it right on and hear Charlie McCarthy again ! Do n't you remember the way that little guy would talk , making fun of the other guy , whatever his name was , you know , and here that other one was just the same as him all the time . " Ezra took out the big Victorian penny that had served him for a pocket-piece during all these years . He tossed it back and forth from one hand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie McCarthy again . " Yes , you remember too , " he went on . " Why , you used to be able to go down to the picture-house and pay your money and gop171right in ! And you would hear all that music going with the film , and see  --  oh , maybe  --  Bob Hope or Dotty Lamour . Yes , those were the days all right ! Do you suppose that p'raps if we all got togetherand worked hard we could find some of those films and rig them up to show them to all the kids ? I can just hear them laughing . Maybe we could get a Charlie Chaplin film somewhere ! " Ezra took out a cigarette and a match , and as he scratched the match it broke into a bright flame . Matches never seemed to deteriorateif they were in a fairly dry place . Yet nobody now knew how to make matches , and at every sudden spurt of flame there was one match the fewer . Ish had a strange feeling about Ezra , who was thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time was scratching a match . George was the one who spoke next : " If there was any way of making people help me , just one or two of the boys , I could get that gas refrigerator fixed up and working iii two , three days , maybe . " George stopped speaking , and Ish supposed that he had finished , for George was never much of a talker . Surprisingly , he went on : " About those there laws , though , that you was talking about . I do n't know . I was kind of glad that we live in a place where we do n't have no laws . These days , you can do just about the way you want . You can go out and park your car anywhere you want to . Right by a fire-hydrant , maybe , and nobody 's going to give you a ticket , that is , you could park it right by the fire-hydrant if you had a car that would run . " This was as far in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and George responded to his own humor by chuckling quietly . The others all joined in . The standard of humor in The Tribe , Ish realized , had never been very high . Ish was about to say something more , but Ezra spoke again . " Come on , now , I propose a toast , " he said . " To law and order ! " The older people laughed a little at hearing the old phrase again , but to the younger ones it meant nothing . They drank the toast , and then everything slipped back quite naturally into merely a social occasion again . After all , Ish reflected , it was a social occasion , just as well per/haps , not to let business interfere too much . Perhaps the seed he had planted with this rendition of his impassioned little speech would have some effect in the future . Yet , he felt doubts . You used to have the jokes about never fixing the roof until it rained . People were undoubtedly the same now , or worse . They might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that something would almost certainly be unpleasant  --  most likely , serious . Yet he drank the toast with the others , and with half his mind he listened to the talk . ' With the other half , nevertheless , he still kept to his own thoughts . This had been a good day ; yes , on this day he had carved 21 into the smooth surface of the rock , and the Year 22 had begun ; on this day , also , partly because the year had been named as it was , he had become more conscious of the possibilitiesin his youngest son . He glanced to where Joey was sitting , and caught in return a quick bright glance , full of the small boy 's admiration for his father . Yes , perhaps , there was one at least who could understand fully . In all that immense and complex system of dams and tunnels , aqueducts and reservoirs , by which water was brought from the mountains to the cities , one particular section of steel pipe in the main aqueduct supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacture certain imperfections had been apparent . It had happened , however , to go past the inspector just at the close of a day , when his senses were dulled and his judgment impaired . No great harm resulted . The section of pipe was set into place by the workmen , and functioned without difficulty . Shortly before the Great Disaster , a foreman had noticed that this section had developed a slight leak . By the welding of a patch upon it , however , it would be made as good as new , or even stronger than the average . Then through the years no man passed that way again . A little trickle of water from the faulty section of pipe grew very graduallylarger . Even in the dry summers a small patch of green showed by the dripping pipe ; birds and small animals came there to drink.  |p173And  still rust ate from the outside , and from the inside the corrosiveaction of the water itself slowly bored outward to meet the rust pits , piercing pinprick after pinprick in the tough skin of steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jets of fine spray played from the surface of the pipe . Now the puddle was a drinking-place for cattle . In five more years a little stream ran off from beneath , the only summer stream in all that dry foothill region . By now the pipe was beginning to be honey-combed with rust , its actual structure grown weak . Beneath the pipe the ground had long been soft and muddy , and the tramping of animals had aided the erosion of a little gully . Finally , the erosion was sufficient to start a mud flow in the soft wet soil on which the concrete pier rested , the one which supported the pipe with its heavy load of water . As the pier settled , the weight of the water was thrown upon the weakened pipe . A long rent opened in its rust-riddled steel , and a broad stream of water poured out and gushed down into the gully . This torrent soon undermined the footing still more , and it shifted again . Once more the pipe tore , and the stream of water issuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ish had crawled into bed that evening the sharp crack of a rifle shot brought him sitting full upright , tense . Another resounded , and then a fusillade began popping in the night . He felt the bed shaking gently , as Em laughed quietly beside him . He relaxed . " Same old trick ! " he said . " Tooled you badly this time ! " " I 've been thinking too much about all the future today , I suppose . Yes , I suppose my nerves are stirred up a little too much today . " The fusillade was still popping in a good imitation of guerrilla warfare , but he lay down and tried to relax . He knew now what had happened . After everyone had left the bonfire , one of the boys had sneaked back and thrown a few boxes of cartridges into the hot ashes . As soon as the boxes were burned through and thingsp174became hot enough , the cartridges had let loose . Like most practicaljokes it involved a certain element of risk , but at this time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger of starting a fire . Also , most of the people had been warned in advance or knew what was likely to happen and so would be sure to keep a long way from the hot ashes . Indeed , Ish reconsidered , he himself might have been the particular object of this joke , and everyone else might have known about it . All right ! If so , he was successfully baited . He felt a sense of irritation , but for more serious reasons , he thought , than because he had been fooled . " Well , " he said to Em , " there they go again  --  more boxes of cartridges popping off uselessly , and no one left in the world who knows how to make cartridges ! And here we are in a country overrun with mountain-lions and wild bulls , and cartridges the only way we have of keeping them under control , and for food we do n't know how to kill cattle or rabbits or quail except by shootingthem . " Em seemed to have nothing to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events of the bonfire itself . That fire had been built up largely out of sawed timber brought from a lumber-yard , interspersed with cartons of toilet-paper , which burned beautifully because of the holes through the middle . In addition , boxes of matches had been scattered through the fire because they went up with fine flares , and there had also been cans of alcohol and cleaning-fluid to give further zest . Doubtless , if you had had to buy all those materials with money , the bonfire would have cost ten thousand dollars in the Old Times ; now , those materials might be considered even more valuable , because they had come to be completely irreplaceable . " Do n't worry , dearest , " he heard her say now . " It 's time to go to sleep . " He settled down beside her , his head close against her breast , seeming as always to draw strength and confidence from her . " I 'm not worrying much , I suppose , " he said . " Maybe I really enjoy all this , feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were living dangerously . "  |p175Ile  lay still for a moment more , and she said nothing , and then he went on with his thinking aloud . " Do you remember I 've been saying this a long time now , that we have to live more creatively , not just as scavengers ? It 's bad for us , I think , even psychologically . Why , I was saying this way back even at the time when Jack was going to be born . " " Yes , I remember . You 've said it a great many times , and yet , some way or other , it still seems easier just to keep on opening cans as long as there are plenty of cans in the grocery stores and warehouses . " " But the end will come some time . Then , what will people do ? " " Well , I suppose , whatever people there are then  --  they will just have to solve that problem for themselves .... And , dear , I 've always wished you would n't worry so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of people who were like you , that thought about things a long way off . But all you have are usual people like Ezra and George and me . And we do n't think that way . Darwin  --  was n't that his name ?  --  said that we all came from apes or monkeys or something , and I suppose apes and monkeys and things like that never thought much about the future . If we 'd come from bees or ants , we might have planned out things ahead , or even if we had been trained like squirrels to store up nuts for the winter . " " Yes , maybe . But in the Old Times people thought about the future . Look at the way they built up civilization . " " And they had Dotty  --  what was her name ?  - -  and Charlie McCarthy , just like Ezra says . " Then suddenly she went off on anothertangent . " And about all this scavenging business that worriesyou so much ! Is it so very different from what people used to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to one of the hardware stores , and find a little copper wire , and take that and hammer it up . In the Old Times , they just went and dug some copper out of a hill somewhere . It maybe was copper ore and not just copper , but still they were scavenging in a way , for it was there all the time . And as far as the food goes , they grew it by using up what was stored in the ground , and changing that into wheat . We just take most of our stuff out of what is stored up somewhere else . I do n't know that there 's too much difference ! "  |p176The  argument stopped him for a moment . Then he rallied . " No , that 's not just right either , " he said . " At least , they were more creative than we are . They were a going concern . They produced what they used as they went along . " " I 'm not too sure about that , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cheap things like the Sunday supplementsthat we were always just at the point of running out of copper or oil , or were exhausting the soil so we would n't have anything to live on in the future . " Then from long experience , he knew that she was wanting to go to sleep . He gave her the last word , and said nothing more . But he himself lay awake , his thoughts still running fast . He remembered clear back to times just after the Great Disaster when he had thought of ways in which civilization might again start to go . Then he remembered how he had thought of change itself  --  how sometimes it comes from the inside of a man , reacting outward against the environment , and how sometimes the environment presses in against the man , forcing him to change . Only the unusualman perhaps was strong enough to press outward against the world . And from thinking of the unusual man , he went naturally to thinking of little Jocy , the bright one with the quick eyes , the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been saying . He tried to guess what Joey would be like when he grew older , and he thought how some day he might be able to talk to Joev . He imagined the words . " You and I , Jocy , " he would say , " we are alike , we understand ! Ezra and George and the others , they are good people . They are good solid average people , and the world could n't get along without having lots of them , but they have no spark . We have to give the spark ! " Then from thinking of Joey , who was at the top , his mind ran rapidly through the others , ending with Evie , who was at the bottom . Should they have ever kept Evie all these years ? He wondered . There had been a word  --  euthanasia , was n't it ?  --  for that kind of thing . " Mercy-killing , " they called it sometimes . Yet whop177was qualified in a group like this to take the responsibility of removingsomeone like Evie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself nor to anyone else ? To do anything like that , he realized , they would have to have a power much stronger than the mere authority of an American father over his children , much stronger than that of the group of friends exercisinga mild public opinion . Something would happen some time , not necessarily about Evie of course . But something would happen some time , and then they would have to organize and take stronger action . His imagination stirred him so powerfully that he made a quick movement of his body , as if already he were taking countermeasuresagainst whatever it was that might have happened . Either Em had not been asleep , or else his sudden movement waked her . " What is it , dearest ? " she said . " You jumped like some little clog that dreams it 's chasing a lion ! " " Something 's going to happen some time ! " he said , speaking as if she already knew the course of his thoughts . " Yes , I know , " she said  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to have to do something . Organize ' I think is the word . We 're going to have to do something about what has happened . " " You knew what I was thinking ? " " Well , you 've said the same thing before , you know . You 've said it very often . Especially around New Years you say it . George talks about the refrigerator , and you talk about something going to happen . Some way or other , nothing has happened yet . " " Yes , but some time it will . It 's bound to ! Some year I 'll be right . " " All right , dearest . Go on worrying . You 're probably the kind that do n't feel comfortable unless you 've got something to worry about  --  and that particular worry , I guess , wo n't do you much harm . " She said nothing more , but she reached over and took him into her arms , and held him close . From the touch of her body , as always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broken pipe of the aqueduct the water had now been gushing out like a small river during a period of several weeks . No more water flowed on into the reservoirs . At the same time , from thousands of leaks which had developed through the course of the years , from the many faucets left running at the time of the Great Disaster , from the major breaks occurring at the time of the earthquake  --  fromall of them , the stored water ran out from the reservoirs , and their levels fell steadily.  |p179As  Ish had expected , they did nothing . Weeks passed . There was no heaving and grunting of men as they carried the refrigerator up the hill , no click and crunch of spades preparinga garden plot . Ish worried occasionally , but in general life drifted along , and even he could not be much concerned . With his old student 's habit of observing even when he did not participate , he often wondered just what might be happening . Was it really , as he sometimes imagined , that all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result of the suddendestruction of their old society ? His studies in anthropology supplied him with examples  --  the head-hunters and the plains Inclians , who had lost the will to readjust and even the will to live , of ter their traditional way of life had rudely been made impossible . If they could no longer go head-hunting or ride out to steal horses and take scalps , they had no desire for anything else either . Or , with a mild climate and food-supplies easy to obtain , was therep180now simply no stimulus to change ? He could recollect possible examplesof this kind also  --  some of the South Sea islanders , or those tropical peoples who lived chiefly on bananas . Or was it something else ? Fortunately , he had enough background of philosophy and historyto keep his perspective . He was actually , he realized , struggling to solve a problem which had baffled philosophers from the time when they had first become conscious of problems at all . He was facing the basic question of the dynamics of society . What made a society change ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Koheleth or Plato or Malthus or Toynbee . He saw a society reducedin size until it had attained the simplicity of a laboratory experiment . Yet , whenever he had arrived at this stage of argument , anotherthought cut across and disturbed the simplicity . He began to feel himself less scientific but more human , to think more nearly as Em thought . This society along San Lupo Drive was not really a philosopher 's neat microcosm , a small dip out of the general ocean of humanity . No  --  it was a group of individuals . It was Ezra and Em and the boys  --  yes , and Joey ! Change the individuals , and the whole situation changed . Change even one individual ! In the place of Em , if we had had  --  well , say , Dotty Lamour ? Or , instead of George , one of those high-powered minds that he remembered from his University years  --  Professor Sauer , perhaps ! Again the situation would change . Or would it ? Possibly not , for in the test the physical environmentmight be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mould . But in one detail Ish thought that Em was wrong . She did not need to fear that he was worrying too much about the situation and would end up with ulcers or a neurosis . Instead , his observationof what was happening kept him interested in life . At first , just after the Great Disaster , he had devoted himself to observing the changes in the world as the result of the disappearance of man . After twenty-one years , however , the world had fairly well adjusted itself , and further changes were too slow to call for day-to-day or even month-to-month observation . Now , however , the problem ofp181society  --  its adjustment and reconstitution  --  had moved to the fore , ; Hid become his chief interest . Then at this point in the recurrent course of his thinking he always had to correct himself again . He could not , and should not , 1 ) c merely the observer and student . Plato and the others  --  each of them could merely watch and comment , even cynically , if he so felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he himself was in no appreciable way responsible for the growth and development of the society in which he lived . Only now and then had the scholar also become the ruler  --  Marcus Aurelius , Thomas More , Woodrow Wilson . To be sure , Ish realizedthat he himself was not a ruler exactly , but he was the man of ideas , the thinker , in a community of only a few individuals . Necessarily the others turned to him in their rare times of trouble , and if any real emergency should arise , he would almost certainly have to assume leadership . The thought had already in the course of the years sent him to the City Library after books about scholars who had also become rulers . Their fates were not comforting . Marcus Aurelius had worn himself out , body and soul , in bloody and fruitless campaigns on the Danube frontier . Thomas More had gone to the scaffold , and afterwards , ironically , he had been canonized as a martyr of the Church . The biographers often called Wilson a martyr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woodrow . No , the m polar in power had not prospered notably . Yet he , Ish , in a communitywhich even yet numbered only thirty-six people , was so placed that he probably could wield more influence in the shaping of its future than an emperor or a chancellor or a president in the Old Times . Heavy rains in the week after New Years had slowed the falling of the water level in the reservoir . Then , a little earlier than usual , came the mid-winter dry spell . Like the blood of some leviathan oozing from a hundred thousandpin-pricks , the life-giving water flowed away through open faucets and leaking joints and broken pipes . And now , where the still-standing gauge showed that the depthp182had recently been twenty feet , only a thin skim of water covered the bottom of the reservoir . When Ish woke up that morning , he realized that it was a fine sunny day , and that he had slept well and was rested . Em was gone from the bed , and he heard the familiar little sounds from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He lay still for a few minutes , thoroughly enjoying himself , coming back more slowly than usual to full consciousness . He felt it a very fortunate circumstance to be able to lie in bed a little while longer if you wished , not merely on Sunday morning , but on any morning . There was no sharp looking at clocks , in the life that they lived now , and no need for him or for anyone else , to catch the 7:53 train . He was living a life of greater freedom than anyone could possibly have lived in the Old Times . Perhaps , with his special temperament he was even living more happily now than he could have lived then . When he felt ready , he got up and shaved . There was no hot water , but he did not care about that particularly . As a matter of fact , nobody would have minded if he had not shaved at all , but he liked the sense of cleanliness and stimulation that the shave gave him . He dressed  --  a new sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet into some comfortable slippers , went slopping down stairs , and steered toward the kitchen . As he came to the door , he heard Em say , rather more sharply than she was used to speak , " Josey child , why do n't you turn that faucet farther , so you can really get some water ? " " But , Mommie , it is turned on , as hard as I can turn it . " Ish , coming into the kitchen , saw that Josey was holding the tea-kettle in the sink under the faucet , and that only a trickle of water was running . " Morning ! " he said . " I guess I 'll have to get George to come over and fix up that plumbing a little bit . Josey , why do n't you run out into the garden , and get some water from one of the outside faucets ? " Josey trotted off agreeably , and when she was gone , Ish tookp183the opportunity to kiss Em , and to tell her what he was planningfor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then came back with the kettle full . " The water out there ran faster for a little while , and then it just died out to a trickle , too , " she said , setting the kettle on the gasoline-stove . " That 's a nuisance ! " said Em . " We 'll need more water for washing the dishes . " Ish recognized the tone of voice . This was one of the times when a crisis was laid directly at the feet of the menfolk to do something about . Breakfast was served on the dining-room table , and the table looked just about the way it might have looked in the Old Times . lsh sat at one end , and Em at the other . They had only four children at home now . Robert , who was sixteen , and almost fully grown up , according to the standards of The Tribe , sat on one side . Beside him was Walt , who was twelve , and very big and activefor his age . And on the other side , close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of whose work was to help with breakfast , by aiding with the cooking and setting of the table , and running in and out to wait on table and helping to wash the dishes afterwards . As he sat down , Ish could not help thinking how little this particularscene differed from what it might have been in the Old ' Imes ) To be sure , he would never have expected then to be thetiler of so many children . But , granting the numbers , the family roue was just what it might have been at any time in almost ny society  --  father , mother , and children , tightly grouped to form be basic social unit , so basic in fact that it might be considered biological rather than social . After all , he thought , the family was the toughest of all human institutions . It had preceded civilization , and so it naturally survived afterwards . There was grapefruit-juice , out of cans , of course . Ish had long since begun to doubt seriously whether after all this time there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juices . Even the taste had gone flat . But they continued drinking it , because it felt good on the stomach , even though there might not bep184any vitamins , and at worst it probably was doing them no harm . There were no eggs , because there had been no hens since the Great Disaster . There was no bacon , either , because canned or glassed bacon was hard to find now and there were no pigs in this vicinity , as far as they had ever discovered . But they had beef-ribs , braised and well browned , which were a fairly good substitute for bacon , even to Ish 's taste . The children , of course , liked nothing better . In fact , they made the principal part of their breakfast on the beef-ribs because they had grown up being largely meat-eaters and expecting or wanting little else . Ish and Em , on the contrary , had always been used to having toast or cereal , and now that the rats and weevils had ruined all flour and packaged cereals , they had hominy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something like a breakfast-food . They ate it with canned milk and to sweeten it there was white corn-syrup , because lately they had been unable to find any sugar that rats and weather had spared . The grownupsalso had coffee . Ish used milk and corn-syrup in his ; Em had always preferred hers black and unsweetened anyway . The vacuum-packedcoffee , like the grapefruit juice , had lost much of its flavor . They had settled gradually upon this menu as their standard one for breakfast . Except perhaps for lack of vitamins , it seemed to offer a fairly well balanced meal , and to supply vitamins they had fresh fruit whenever they could find any , though now that blight and insects and rabbits had ruined the orchards , there was little fruit to be had , except for wild strawberries and blackberries , a few wormy apples , and some sour plums from trees gone wild . On the whole , however , Ish found it a satisfying breakfast . After he had finished , Ish slumped into an easy chair in the livingroom , picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the cigarette was not very satisfactory . They were no longer able to find vacuum-packed ones , and the ordinary ones had dried out almost completely in the packages now , no matter how well sealed . You had to keep them in the humidifier a while to get them decently smokable , and then the trouble was that you were likely to get them even too damp . That was what was wrong withp185this one . And then also , he could not quite enjoy the cigarette because his conscience was bothering him . From the kitchen he could hear uncertain sounds from Em and the twins , and he gathered that they were still having trouble getting water . " Might as well go over , " he thought , " and see George , and get him to clean out that pipe or whatever it is . " He got up and went out . On the way to George 's , however , he stopped at Jean 's house to pick up Ezra  --  not that Ezra could fix anything , or that he needed Ezra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always liked to see Ezra . He knocked , and Jean came to the door . " Ez is not here now , " she said . " He 's over at Molly 's this week . " Ish had the funny feeling that he often had when facing the actual practice of bigamy . He did not exactly see how Jean and Molly kept on such good terms , and even helped each other out i  --  all the little emergencies of housekeeping . It was merely anothertriumph of Ezra 's at getting along with human beings and making them get along with each other . Ish turned to go , and then he recollected , and looked back . " Oh , Jean , " he said . " Say , is your water running all right this morning ? " " Why , no , " said Jean . " No , it is n't . There 's just a little trickle coming out . " She closed the door , and Ish went down the porch steps and headed for Molly 's house . He felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Molly 's , and discovered that she at least had had no difficulty with water . That , however , might be the result of her house being several feet lower than Jean 's so that the water might not yet have run out of the pipes . - They went over to George 's house , which stood neat and trim inside its freshly painted white picket-fence . Maurine showed them into the living-room , and told them to sit down while she went to get George , who was puttering around somewhere as usual . Ish sat down in one of the big velour-covered overstuffed chairs . Then , as always , he looked around the living-room with ap186sense of amazement , mingled with an almost perverted pleasure . The living-room in George and Maurine 's house looked exactly the way the living-room of any prosperous carpenter would have looked back in the years before the Great Disaster . There were bridge-lamps with pink shades , and tassels hanging from them . There was a very expensive electric clock , and a magnificent consoleradio-phonograph , which had four different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On both tables were scarfs carefully crumpled up to give an elegant look to things , and on one table were neat piles of several popular magazines . The bridge-lamps did not work , because there was no electricity , and the hands of the electric clock always stood at 12:17 . The magazines were at least twenty-one years old . There were no programson the air for the radio to pick up , even if there had been any electric current by which the radio and the phonograph could run . Yet all these things were the symbols of prosperity . George had been a carpenter in the Old Times . Maurine had then been married to a man who must have been about the social and financial equal of George . Such people always wanted to have fine bridgelampsand electric clocks and radios and all the rest , and now that it was possible to have all these things , they had merely gone out and got them and put them into the house . Their not workingwas secondary . In the evening Maurine merely brought in a kerosene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got their light from it instead of from the bridge-lamps , and they had a wind-up phonograph for actual use . It was ridiculous , and also a little pitiful . Yet , when Ish considered the matter , he always rememberedEm 's first reaction to it . " Well , " she had said , " do n't you remember in the Old Times people would have a piano , maybe a grand piano , in the livingroom , even though nobody could play it ? And they had a set of those books  --  what did they call them ?  --  the Harvard Classics , though they never read them . And maybe they had a fireplace that never even had a chimney attached to it . All those things were just to show off that you could afford them . They were proof that you had arrived . So I do n't see much difference now ifp187George and Maurine want to have their bridge-lamps , even if they ca n't get any light from them . " They heard George coming in from the back , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipe-wrench in one hand , and was wearing his usual costume of carpenter 's overalls , rather dirty and well stained with paint smears . He could have used new overalls every day , but apparently he felt more comfortable in ones that were well broken in . " Hi , George , " said Ezra , who usually managed to say the first word . " C'morning , George , " said Ish . George seemed to chew his tongue for a moment , as if really considering what the situation demanded . Then he said : " Morning , Ish . . . . Morning , Ezra . " " Say , George , " said Ish . " No water over at Jean 's or at our place this morning . How about here ? " There was a pause . " None here , neither , " said George . " Well , " said Ish , " what do you make of it ? " George hesitated , working his mouth and lips , as if he were chewing the end of an imaginary cigar . Ish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reflected , controlling himself , that George was a solid person and a very good one to have ; hound . " Well , " he repeated , " what do you make of it , George ? " George made a motion as if to put the imaginary cigar into one corner of his mouth , and then he replied . " Well , if she 's off over there too , I guess there 's no use looking any more for some block in my pipes around here , way I was . I guess she 's broke or clogged up somewheres on the main pipe that comes to all these Houses . " Ish caught a sidelong glance from Ezra , and a ghost of a smile on his face as much as to say that after all any of them might have figured that out and that George 's pronouncement was not exactly the word of a mental giant . " I guess you must be be right , George , " Ish said . " But what are we going to do about it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke : " Well , I du n no . " Like Em , George obviously considered this to be out of his province . Give him a dripping faucet or a plugged toilet , and he would be happy taking care of it for you . But he was no mechanic , and certainly no engineer . So , as it always happened , Ish had to take the lead . " Where did all this water come from anyway ? " he asked on the impulse . The others both were silent . It was curious . Here they had been for twenty-one years merely using water that continued to flow , and yet they had never given any real consideration to where the water came from . It had been a gift from the past , as free as air , like the cans of beans and bottles of catsup that could be had just by walking into a store and taking them from the shelves . Ish indeed had vaguely thought about the matter sometimes , and wondered how long the water would continue to run , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another supply . But he had never got round to doing anything . Water which had already run for many years might well continue to run for many years more , and so there was no pressure for action . In all those years there had never been one single day , until this one , when there had been any immediate reason why he should say to himself : " Today I must do something about the water-supply . " So now Ish glanced from George to Ezra , and had no response to his question . George merely stood , shifting weight from one foot to the other . Ezra had a little twinkle in his eyes , to indicate that this was not his department . Ezra knew people . When he had clerked in that liquor-store he must have been good at jollyinghis customers along and making tie-in sales . But when it came to handling ideas and things , Ish was better than Ezra . Ish saw that he would have to answer his own question . " This water must come from the old city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come , I mean . The old pipes are still there . I think the best thing for us to do would be to go up to the reservoir and see whether there is any water in that . "  | " O.K. , " said Ezra , agreeable as ever . " Maybe , though , we should sec what the boys think about it . " " No , " said Ish . " They wo n't know anything about it . If it was a question of hunting or fishing , we could ask the boys . But the boys would n't know anything about this . " They went out and began calling the dogs , and getting ready to harness up the teams to the wagons . The reservoir was not more than a mile away , but ever since he had been mauled by the mountain-lion , Ish was not good at long walks , and George was beginning to suffer from the stiffness of old age in his legs . Getting the dogs together and making everything ready always took some time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a lost art . There were no wild horses left in the immediate vicinity , but he was sure that they could find plenty of them farther east in the open plains country of the San Joaquin Valley . But the trouble really was that all three men had been city-people who were used to driving automobiles ; not one of them really knew anything about horse-keeping or horse-managing , and so they had never made the effort to keep horses . Actually , the dogs were in many ways more convenient because they demanded little care , and fed on the less choice cuts of the many cattle which could be killed easily in the surrounding country . But to have horses , you would have had to see that they were kept on good pasture , and protected from wolves and lions . So on the whole , now that automobiles were difficult to keep running , the dog-teams were probably the simplest answer to their modest requirements for transportation , and George was very happy to make the little wagons and keep them in repair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he was driving in one of the wagons behind four dogs , that he was acting in some kind of ridiculous pageant , and made a ludicrous spectacle . But , of course , no one else felt the same , and he had gradually come to accept the situation . After all , people had thought it natural to have dogs pull sleds . Why not wagons ? They left the dog-teams at the foot of the final slope , and climbed up along the old path , breaking their way through thick blackberry bushes . They stood at the edge of the reservoir , andp190looked across its empty expanse . There was a little skim of water in two or three low spots , but the outlet-pipe stood up into the air . They took a long look , and it was Ezra who spoke at last : " That 's that ! " They discussed the possibilities a little , but without much interestor conviction . They were already half way through the rainy season , so that there was little possibility that rainfall would put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path , picked up the dog-teams , and started home . As they neared the houses , the dogs began to bark , and the house-dogs barked back at them . Everyone had time to assemble at Ish 's house to hear the news . When they had heard it , the older people looked so glum that the children caught the infection , and one little fellow , who was probably too young to understand anything actually , began to cry . In the babble of conversation it soon became evident that no one was much worried about actual thirst , but that the women were greatly concerned that the toilets would no longer work . They did not mind this one day , but it was the thought that they would never work again ! It seemed that all life had taken a step backward . Only Maurine accepted the situation philosophically . " I growed up my first eighteen years on the old farm in South Dakota , " she said . " I run out to the out-house , all kinds of weather , and I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Saturdays . That was one of the things I liked best when patty piled us into the old Chcvvy and we went to California . But I always felt it would n't last , and I 'd end up , a-runnin ' out in all weathers , way I began . Flushers was nice . But it 's all over now , and I say , Thank the good Lord the weather ai n't so cold here as in South Dakota . ' " The older men were more concerned with the problem of drinking-water . At first , like the confirmed city-dwellers that they had been , they thought in terms of finding where supplies of bottled water had been left in the stores and warehouses . But soon they saw that even in the approaching dry season , there could be no real lack of water . In spite of the long rainless summer , the area was not a desert , and the little streams in the gullies , though no one had ever paid much attention to them , must actually bep191supplying the water for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region . Just at this point , a distinction between the older generation and the younger began to show itself . Ish , in spite of having been a geographer , could not have told off-hand where there was a single spring or dependable stream in the neighborhood , although he could still locate positions by names of streets and intersections . The youngsters , on the other hand , could quickly tell him where there was a stream of running water at this season of the year , or where there would be pools of water , or where there were springs . They could not locate these places by reference to streets , but they could tell in general where they were , and could go to them withouthesitation . Ish suddenly found himself being instructed by his own son Walt , who assured him that at this season of year there would be running water in a little gully which Ish had scarcely ever noticed because it flowed through under San Lupo Drive by means of a storm drain . Before long , the original consternation changed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sent off with the clog-teams and some five-gallon cans to bring back water from the nearest spring . The older ones began to dig holes vigorously , and to set up outhouses . The enthusiasm lasted for several hours , and resulted in a noticeableamount of work . Steady pick-and-shovel labor , however , was something to which no one was accustomed , and by noon there was widespread complaint about blisters and weariness . When they separated for lunch , Ish suddenly became aware that no one was coming back for work . It was amazing how many importantmatters seemed to be planned for that afternoon  --  such as going fishing , and wiping out an ugly-acting bull who might prove dangerous , and shooting a mess of quail for dinner . Besides , by now the enthusiastic youngsters had brought in a supply of water which was plentiful for all immediate needs of drinking and cooking . The difference between having a small water-supply and no water at all was tremendous , psychologically . A five-gallon can sitting in the kitchen-sink took away all sense of strain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was notp192going to go out and dig by himself . As the story-books told things , this would have been setting a noble example . Practically , it would make him look ridiculous . Little Joey came , and stood nervously for a moment on his left foot with his right leg bent at the knee , and then reversed . " What 's the matter , Joey ? " said Ish . " Do n't we want to go out and work some more ? " " No , Joey . Not this afternoon . " Joey continued balancing , letting his gaze wander around the room and then come back to his father . " Go along , Joey , " said Ish gently . " Everything 's fine ! We 'll have the lesson at the regular time . " Joey went off , but Ish was touched , even if a little humiliated , by the wordless sympathy which his youngest son was offering . Joey scarcely could understand the larger issues , but his quick mind had sensed that his father was unhappy , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , Joey was the one ! Since that idea had first come to Ish on New Years Day , he had been pressing the lessons , and Joey had been absorbing them eagerly . There was even danger that he might turn out to be a learned pedant . He showed little ability at leadership among the other children , and sometimes Ish had begun to doubt . This small incident just now , for instance ! It might show intelligence and thought for the future , and it might show a tendency to escape from contacts with those of his own age , who were better at games than he , and to seek security in the presence of his father , by whom he felt himself appreciated . Ish hoped that the other children did not feel how strongly Joey had become his favorite . It was not right for a father to play favorites , but this situation had arisen suddenly and involuntarily , that New Years Day . " Oh , " he thought , " do n't worry about it ! " And suddenly he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There on New Years Day , I was suddenly sure that Joey was the Chosen One . Now of course it 's all blurred . Maybe this is only the feeling a father gets for a small son . Later we may squabble , just the way I do withp193Walt now . Yet , I hope ! The other boys were never like this  --  bright , I mean , lightning-quick at lessons . I do n't know . I wish I knew . I 'll keep on trying . " Then , as he lit another cigarette , he was suddenly angry . He himself had not been so very bright ! He had missed the opportunity . During the years he had been saying , " Something is going to happen ! " It had not happened , and they had smiled at him for a gloomy and not-to-be-regarded prophet . Now this morning it had happened ! It had been a shock ! He could remember the scared faces when he and Ezra and George had first come back with the news . Then was the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbed it in . He should have painted the future with disaster . That might have got something done . As it was  --  perhaps he himself had been a little scared at the moment  --  everyone had made as light as possible of the matter , searched for the easiest makeshifts , and thus dulled the edge of what might have been made to seem a disaster . The tribe had really taken the matter in its stride . Or  --  the identity of the word popped an old comparison into his mind  --  it had rolled off , " like water off a duck 's back ! " Four or five hours later , and everybody had apparently settled again into the old happy-go-lucky life ! " Apparently , " yes ! But after all , some sense of shock and uncertainlymust still be lingering . Some had gone fishing and some had gone quail-shooting , and already he had heard two reports of a shot-gun . But all of these must certainly feel a slight sense of irresponsibility , even of guilt , at having left the more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the reaction might go the other way . He would get everybody together for a meeting then . If the iron would not still be red-hot , it might at least have re-warmed a little . Then he himself incongruously crunched out his second afterlunchcigarette , and settled back to rest , comfortable and unharassedby worry , in the big chair . " This is comfortable , " he thought , " This is ... " In those days they will look toward the sea , and cry out suddenly , " A ship , a ship ! . . . Yes , a ship certainly ! . . . Do you notp194see the plume of the drifting smoke ? . . . Yes , it is making for our harbor ! " Then they will be merry with one another and say gaily : " Why were we despondent ? . . . It stood to reason that civilization could not be destroyed everywhere ! . . . Of course , I always said . . . . In Australia , or South Africa , one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there will be no ship , and only a wisp of cloud on the horizon . Or one will wake from his nap in the afternoon , and look upwardquickly . " Surely ! . . . I knew it must come ! . . . That was the motor of a plane . . . . I could not be mistaken . " But it will be only the locust in the bush , and there will be no plane . Or one will rig batteries to a radio-set , and sit with ear-phones , fingering the dials . " Yes ? " he will say sharply . " Be quiet there , all of you ! ... Surely , surely ! . . . Just at 920 ! . . . Someone talking , I heard distinctly , sounded Spanish . . . . There again ! . . . Now it 's faded ! " But there will be no words on the air , only the tricks of the far-off thunderstorm . " Yes , this is comfortable , " thought Ish , resting in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the street came the noise of two loud reports , and he knew at once that they could be nothing but the backfiring of a large truck ! Then , so quickly that he did not seem to take time at all , he was standing on the sidewalk in front of the house , and there was the truck in the middle of the street . It was a fine large truck painted bright red with blue trim , and in large white letters on its sides he saw : U. S. GOVT . A man got out of the truck , and though he had been driving it , he was now ( quite understandably ) wearing a cutawaycoat and a high silk hat . The man said nothing , but Ish of course knew that this was the Governor of California . Ish felt himself filled suddenly with an inexpressible happiness . For again there was security and constituted authority and the strength of the many , instead of only the few in the midst of surrounding darkness , and now he , Ish , was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast unfriendly world . . . . In that bewilderment of happiness too great to be borne , he awoke . The insides of his hands were moist , and his heartp195pounded . As he looked around the familiar room , the happiness faded out like a dying light , and in its place succeeded a woe , equally unutterable . After another moment the woe too faded out as his conscious controls took over . That intense happiness of the dream , so overwhelmingthat it had awakened him  --  he knew now that it had sprung again from that often-repeated dream  --  " wish fulfillment , " they used to say . How many times throughout these twenty-one years had he dreamed it in some form or other ! Not during the first year or two indeed  --  his sense of loneliness and insecurity had seemed to grow cumulatively with the years , piling up faster than the birth of new children could counteract it . Yes , today the symbolism had been very plain . It varied , though usually it was plain enough . He felt a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return of the United States Government . In the Old Times he had never considered himself a flagwavingpatriot , and he had not thought often about such things as the benefits of citizenship . But no more , indeed , did a person think of the air he breathed , until it was taken away . A sense of the vastness and solidity of the United States of America must have affected the sub-conscious feelings of its citizens , he reflected , much more than most of them had imagined . By now he had brought his mind back to his actual world . He stirred in the chair . By the position of the sun he judged that he had slept an hour . Again he heard the distant report of the shotgunfrom the quail-hunters . He smiled wanly , associating it with the back-firing truck . Anyway  --  now he would set about getting the others together for the meeting which he had planned for that evening . Water supplies remained scanty throughout the day , but at least no one suffered from thirst . That evening the older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gathered at Ish 's house at his invitation . Ish found no one very much disturbed . It would be a good idea ( this seemed to be the general opinion ) to try digging a well near one of the houses , rather than to move to some houses nearer a natural water supply . Yes , they probably would have to watch sanitation carefully under the newp196arrangements and see that the children were instructed in such matters . There was no presiding officer . Occasionally someone deferred to Ish to settle a point , but this deference , he realized , might be because he held a faintly recognized natural leadership of intellect or even for no better reason than that he was the host . There was no secretary taking a record of what happened . But then , there were no motions made and no votes taken . As always , it was more a social than a parliamentary gathering . Ish listened to the conversationback and forth . " Come to think of it , though  --  how 's anybody know we 'd get water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well till you do get water . " " Well , that hole-in-the-ground then ? " " You got something there ! " " Maybe this would do better . . . . Run a pipe over to some crick or spring , and hitch it onto our old pipes . " " How about it , George ? That sound O.K. ? " " ... . Why , sure ... I guess so . . . Yeah . . . I guess I could connect up some pipes . " " Trouble would be , though , when everybody wants water at once . " Have to build a dam  --  earth-dam would be all right  --  so 's to have a little bitty head behind your water . " " Guess we could do that ? " .. .. Sure ... Be some work , though . " As the conversation wandered on almost complacently , Ish found himself gradually becoming more disturbed . To him it seemed as if this day had seen a retrograde and perhaps irretrievablestep . Suddenly he found himself on his feet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were there before him . " This should n't have happened , " he said . " We should n't have let this creep up on us . Any time in the last six months we should have been able to see that the water in the reservoir was failing , but we never even went to look at it . And here we are , caught suddenly , and shoved back so that we 'll perhaps never be able top197catch up with things again . We 've made too many mistakes . We ought to be teaching the children to read and write . ( No one has ever supported me strongly enough in that . ) We ought to send an expedition to find out what 's happening other places . It 's not safe not to know what may be happening just over the hill . We should have more domestic animals  --  some hens , anyway . We ought to be growing food . . . " Then , when he was really in full career , someone started clapping , and he stopped for applause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and again he realized that the applausewas ironic . Through the noise of the hand-clapping he heard one of the boys saying : " Good old dad ! He 's said it again ! " And another replied : " Time for George and the refrigerator ! " Ish joined in the laughter . He was not angry this time , but he was crestfallen at having unconsciously repeated himself and even more at having again failed to make his point . Then Ezra was speaking  --  good old Ezra who was always quick to cover up anyone'sembarrassment ! " Yes , that 's the old speech , but maybe there 's a new point there . How about that business of sending out an expedition ? " To Ish 's surprise a vigorous discussion arose , and in its course lie was struck again by the unpredictable quality of people , particularly in a group . He had thrown out the new idea without any special forethought ; it had sprung spontaneously from the events of the day  --  the surprise which had come upon them because they had not taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have considered it the least important of his suggestions , but this was the one that caught the group-imagination . Suddenly everyone was in favor of it , and Ish joined the crowd in vigorous support . It was better , he felt , to do something  --  anything to break the lethargy . Soon he felt himself becoming more enthusiastic . His original idea of an " expedition " had merely been that they should explore the country for a hundred miles or so roundabout , but he foundp198that the others had understood him to envisage something much more . Soon , his imagination kindling , he went along with them . In a few minutes everyone was talking of a transcontinental expedition . " Lewis-and-Clark in reverse ! " thought Ish to himself , but he said nothing , knowing that few of those present would know anything about Lewis and Clark . The talk ran on vigorously : " Too long for walking ! " " Or dog-teams either ! " " Horses would do better , if we had some ! " " There 're sure to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time to catch and break them . " As he listened , still another thought crossed Ish 's mind . His old dream , the one which had come again that afternoon ! How did they really know that the Government of the United States had actually failed ? Even if it had , it might have been reconstituted . It would be small and weak , of course , and might not yet have been able to re-establish touch with the ' West Coast . By their own effort they might make the contact . Another curious feature was that nearly everyone wanted to go ! It was the best evidence you could want as to the way in which people generally  --  males , at least  --  were born with itchy feet , alwaysready to go somewhere else and see new things . The questionbecame one of elimination . Ish was ruled out , scarcely being able to put up a good protest , because of his disability where the mountain-lion had clawed him , far back in the Year of the Lions . George was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was disqualified as being the worst shot of them all and generally the least fitted to take care of himself in the open . As for the " boys , " everyone except themselves agreed that they should not leave their wives and young families . In the end the decision was for Robert and Richard , youngsters , but well able to take care of themselves . Their mothers , Em and Molly , looked doubtful , but the enthusiasm of the meeting overrode their objections . Robert and Richard were delighted . The more ticklish questions were really as to the route and thep199means of transportation . In the last few years no one had used an automobile , and several once-fine cars stood forlorn and ruinous along San Lupo Drive on hopelessly flat tires ; the children used them for playhouses . The trouble of keeping automobiles going was more work than pleasure , and the roads in all directions had become so clogged with fallen trees and the bricks of chimneys brought down by the earthquake that there would have been little practical advantage to trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had a workable one . On top of all that , the younger men had never known the fun of driving a car under good conditions , and so had no interest . Finally , where would you go if you had a car ? You had no friends to visit in the other part of town , and no movies to go to . To bring cans and bottles home from the grocery stores , the dog-teams did well enough , and they also served for fishing-expeditions to the bay-shore . Still , the older ones agreed , it might be possible to get an automobilerunning again , and to drive it for a considerable distance , even on rotten tires , if you kept the speed down below , say , twenty-five miles an hour . And that was really traveling , compared with a dog-team ! Fast enough too to take you to New York in a month easily  --  provided the roads were passable ! That was the other difficult point  --  the route ! Ish was suddenly at home , bringing into play his old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sierra Nevada , would be completelyblocked by fallen trees and landslides , and the roads to the north would probably be the same . The best chance would certainly be through the more open country toward the south , actually the route by which Ish had gone to New York once long before . The desert roads might still be almost as good as ever . The Colorado River bridges might still be standing or might have fallen . The only way to find out would be to go and see . His excitement rising , the old road-maps standing out more clearly in his mind , Ish planned the route eastward . Beyond the Colorado the mountains should not be too difficult , and there were no big rivers for a long way  --  until you came to the Rio Grande at Albuquerque . Beyond there , if you could just getp200through the Sandia Mountains , you had open plateau country , and farther east there would be more and more choice of roads . ( You could still find gasoline in drums ; that would be no great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to get to the Missourior the Mississippi , and even across those largest rivers ; the high steel bridges should still be in good condition , to judge by the Bay Bridge . " What an adventure ! " he burst out . " I 'd give anything to be able to go ! You must look everywhere for people  --  not just one or two , but communities . You must see how other groups are going at solving their problems and getting started again . " Beyond the Mississippi ( he resumed planning the route ) it would be hard to say . That was natural forest country , and the roads might be badly blocked . On the other hand , fires might have kept the growth down , at least across the old prairie country in Illinois . All they could do would be to go and find out , if they even got that far , and to make decisions then . By now the candles were getting well burned down . The clock pointed to ten o'clock , although that was only an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by watching the shadow at noon , and the big clock in his living-room was considered standard for the community . ) But it certainly was a late hour for people who had no electric lights , and so had gradually got around to making more and more use of sunlight . Suddenly the others were all on their feet and taking leave . When they had gone , Ish and Em sent Robert to bed , and then started to straighten up the living-room . Ish felt a nostalgic touch . Things had changed so much , and yet sometimes seemed to have changed not at all ! This might have been away back in the Old Times , and he instead of Robert might have been the youngster just sent upstairs . He instead of Robert might be the one peeping down through the stairway ( as Robert probably was ) , seeing his father and mother moving about , emptyingcigarette trays , shoving cushions back into place , and generally putting the room to rights so that it would not look too devastatingwhen they came down in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which rounded off the evening and let your nerves settle down from the buzz of conversation . When they had finished , they sat on the davenport for a last cigarette . Ish 's mind could not help snapping back to the evening'sdiscussion . Even though things had not turned out as he had at first planned , still he felt that he had carried a main point . " Communications , " he said . " Communications  --  maybe that 's the big thing ! Take it anywhere in history . When a nation or a community got isolated all by itself , it went conservative and then retrograded . It got to acting just the way George and Maurine are over there , gathering in all the things out of the past , and freezing just at that point . That sort of thing , maybe , happened to Egypt and China . But then when there 's contact with some other civilization , everything loosens up again , and gets going . That 's the way it will be with us . " She did not say anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence , that she did not altogether agree . " What is it , darling ? " he asked . " Well , you see , I was thinking maybe it was n't so good for the Indians when they got into communication with the white people , was it ? Or how about all my people on the coast of Africa when they got into contact with the slavers ? " " Yes , but maybe that 's just my point . How would we like it if some slavers came over the hill some fine morning , and we had never known they were anywhere around before ? Would n't it have been better if the Indians could have sent some scouts over to Europe , and been ready for white men who came with horses and guns ? " He was pleased that he had countered so cleverly . After all , her argument had merely been for letting things slide and for living in ignorance . That kind of philosophy could never win in the long run . But all she said was : " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he went on . " I was saying this a long time ago . We 've got to live more creatively , not just as scavengers . Why , I was saying this way back even at the time our first baby was going to be born ! "  | " Yes , I remember . You 've said it a great many times ! And still some way or other , it seems to be easier just to go on opening cans . " " But the end will come some time , and it should n't come suddenlythe way this stopping of the water has today . "  |p203When  he awoke that next morning , Em was gone from the bed . He lay still , relaxed , calmly happy . Then his mind seemed to turn over suddenly and take hold  --  and there it was , starting to make plans , thinking . After a minute , a slight sense of irritation came over him . " You think too much ! " he said to himself . Why did not his mind , like other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy without any planning ahead into the future , whether of the next twenty-four hours or of the next twenty-four years ? Why could he not lie quiet for as long as sixty seconds ? No , something took over with a rush and a whir , and even though his body lay still , his mind turned over and started , and there it was running on , like an idling engine . Engine ? Well , naturally , today he would think of engines ! But the quiet happiness between sleep and waking had definitelyleft him , and pure contentment was gone . With a resentful push of his arm he threw back the blankets.  |p204This  morning was bright and sunny . Though the air was cool , he went out to the little balcony , and stood there , looking off toward the west . During all these years the trees had everywhere grown taller , but he could still see the mountain-top and much of the Bay with its two great bridges . The bridges ! Yes , the bridges ! To him they still were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , as he had often observed , scarcely thought of bridges as anything different from hills or trees ; they were just something that was there . But to him , Ish , the bridges stood testifying daily to the power and the glory that had been civilization . So , he thought , some tribesman -- -Burgund or Saxon  --  might once have looked at a strong-built , not yet decayed , Roman gateway or triumphal arch . But , no , that analogy did not hold . The tribesman was sure and content in his own ancient folkways ; he was first of the new , confident master of his own world . He , Ish , was more like the last of the old , a surviving Roman  --  senator or philosopher  --  spared by barbarian swords and left to brood over an empty and ruinous city , anxious and uncertain , knowing that never again would he meet his friends at the baths or know the deep security that came to a man when he saw a cohort of the Twelfth march down the street . But no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " History repeats itself , " he thought , " but always with varia-tions . " Yes  --  he had had a chance to think a great deal about history ! Its repetitions were not those of a stolid child going over and over the multiplication table . History was an artist , maintaining the idea but changing the details , like a composer keeping the same theme but dulling it to a minor or lifting by an octave , now crooningit with violins , now blaring it on trumpets . As he stood on the little balcony in his pajamas , he felt a light breeze cool on his face . He sniffed it in more deeply , and again it brought to him the realization that even the smell of things had changed . In the Old Times you were not conscious of any characteristic smell to a city , and yet there must have been a complexmingling of smoke and gasoline-fumes and cooking and garbage and even of people . But now there was only a fresh tangp205to the air , such as he had once associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His glance came back to them , as if to a light in the darkness . The Golden Gate Bridge he had not visited in many years . Such a journey would mean a very long walk , or even a long pull for a dog-team ; it would mean camping out overnight . But he still knew well what the Bay Bridge was like , and even from where he stood he could see it clearly . He remembered what it had once been  --  six crowded lanes of swiftly moving cars , the trucks and buses and electric trains rumblingon the lower level . There was , he knew , only one car on the Bridge now  --  that little empty coupe parked neatly at the curb near this end of the West Bay span . The yellowed certificate of registration had been , when he had last noticed , still fastened to the steering-column  --  John S. Robertson ( or , he could not surely remember , it might have been James T. ) of some number on one of the numbered streets in Oakland . Now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weathered to moss-gray . On the surface , to the eye , they had changed . The towers that hid their tops in the summer clouds , the mile-long dipping cables , the interlocked massive beams of steel  --  no longer they cast back the morning sun with a bright sheen of silver-gray . Over them now rested softly the neutral pall of rust , red-brown color of desolation . Only , at the tops of the towers , and along the cables at good spots for perching , the quiet monotone was capped and spotted with the dead-white smears of the droppings of birds . Yes , through the years the sea-birds had perched there  --  the gulls and pelicans and cormorants . And on the piers the rats scurried , and fought , and bred and nested , and lived as only rats can  --  squeaking and fighting , and breeding and nesting , and at low tide feeding on mussels and crabs . The broad roadway , unused , showed few signs of change  --  only roughnesses and a few cracks here and there . Where blown dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was growing , and a few hardy weeds , not many . Within its deeper structure also , the bridge was still intact andp206unchanged . The superficial rust had done no more than wipe out a small fraction of the safety-factor . At the eastern approach , where salt water during time of storms splashed against the long-unpaintedsteel supports , corrosion had eaten somewhat deeper . An engineer , if there had been one , would have shaken his head , and ordered the replacement of some members before allowing traffic to resume . But that was all . In the enduring structure of the bridge , longdeadcivilization still defied the attacks of all the powers of air and sea . Ish roused himself from his trance-like contemplation , and went in to shave . The clean touch of the steel was at once soothingand stimulating . Cheerfully now , happy with the expectation of purposive action , he found himself thinking of the things to be done that day . He would have to see that they started in again with work on the outhouses and the well . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interior . ( President Jeffersongiving instructions to Lewis and Clark ! ) He would have to see what could be done about making a car work once more . Perhaps , he thought happily , this would be the day on which they would take the road again , not only in a car literally , but also figuratively  --  the road toward the rebirth of civilization . He finished shaving , but the moment seemed golden . So he lathered again , and started over his face once more .... This community now , these thirty-some people who held the seed of the future  --  they were fair enough individuals , not brilliant by a long way , but sound . The original adults had been better in spite of their shortcomings than you would have expected to get if you had merely reached down into the great bin of humanity in the old United States and taken the first that came by chance . He ran over them again rapidly in his mind , and ended upon himself . How did he stack up among the others ? Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , he had even sat down and listed his qualifications for the new life . Such things , for instance , as having had his appendix out . Well , having no appendix was still an advantage , although actually , no one hadp207been bothered with that kind of trouble . But he had listed other things which now , he realized , had ceased to be advantageous . He had listed , for instance , his quality of being able to get along without other people . That was no longer a virtue . Perhaps , it was even a vice . But he himself had changed also in those years . If he listed his qualities now , they would not be exactly the same ones . He had read widely , and learned much . Even of more importance , he had lived with Em , and had become the father of a family . Ile had matured , as a man should . He had a stronger will , he realized , than George or Ezra . If the test came , they would yield to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . He disassembled the razor , and threw the blade into the medicinecloset , where there were already a lot of blades lying around . He never bothered to use a blade more than once , because there were so many thousands of them available that there seemed no need of economy . And yet this problem of what to do with the old razor blades was still curiously present . He remembered jokes about that , from long ago . Funny how a little thing remained the same after so many big things had changed irrevocably ! After breakfast Ish went over to talk with Ezra . They sat on the steps of the porch . Before long , more people came along , and a little group formed , as always happened when anybody seemed to be having an interesting conversation . There was talk back and forth , and a good deal of easygoing fun-making , with a little horseplayamong the younger people . Everybody seemed to agree , in general , that they ought to get to work again , but nobody was in a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when George in his slow way began again to bring up the old question of the gas-refrigerator . At last , however , Ezra and the three younger men with an accompanyingrag - tag of little boys and girls moved off to begin work . As soon as they had really started , a kind of enthusiasm fell upon them . Everyone , even Ezra , suddenly began to run , trying to see who would be the first one there to start digging . Ish could see Evie running with the rest  --  although she could not know what was happening  --  her blond hair streaming wildly behind her . Who got there first , he could not tell , but in a moment dirt started top208fly in all directions . He did not know whether to be amused or perturbed . Everyone seemed to be turning serious work into a kind of play , as if unable to distinguish between work and play . That might sound fine , but you could not accomplish much , he thought , without settling down to labor . As it was , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the dirt would move more slowly ; then , children first , older ones soon afterward , everyone would probably drift off to something else . When once they stalked the deer , or crouched shivering in the mud for the flight of ducks to alight , or risked their lives on the crags after goats , or closed in with shouts upon a wild boar at bay  --  that was not work , though often the breath came hard and the limbs were heavy . When the women bore and nursed children , or wandered in the woods for berries and mushrooms , or tended the fire at the entrance to the rock-shelter  --  that was not work either . So also , when they sang and danced and made love , that was not play . By the singing and dancing the spirits of forest and water might be placated  --  a serious matter , though still one might enjoy the song and the dance . And as for the making of love , by that  --  and by the favor of the gods  --  the tribe was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mingled always , and there were not even the words for one against the other . But centuries flowed by and then more of them , and many things changed . Man invented civilization , and was inordinately proud of it . But in no way did civilization change life more than by sharpeningthe line between work and play , and at last that division came to be more important than the old one between sleeping and waking . Sleep came to be thought a kind of relaxation , and " sleeping on the job " a heinous sin . The turning out of the light and the ringingof the alarm-clock were not so much the symbols of man 's dual life as were the punching of the time-clock and the blowing of the whistle . Men marched on picket-lines and threw bricks and exploded dynamite to shift an hour from one classification to the other , and other men fought equally hard to prevent them . And always work became more laborious and odious , and play grew more artificial and febrile.  |p209Only  Ish and George were left standing there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting ready to say something . Funny , Ish thought , you would n't think anyone could pause until he had said something ; George paused before he said anything . " Well , " said George , and then he paused again . " Well .... I guess I better go get some planks . . . so I can wall in the sides ... after she gets deeper . " " Fine ! " said Ish . George at least , Ish knew , would get the work done . He had carried the habit of work over so strongly from the Old Times that he perhaps could never really play . George went off after his planks , and Ish went to find Dick and Bob , who had been collecting and harnessing the dog-teams . He found the two boys in front of his own house . Three dog - teams were ready . A rifle-barrel was sticking out from one wagon . Ish considered for a moment . Was there anything else he should take along ? He felt a lack . " Oh , say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please , and get my hammer . " " Aah , why do you want that ? " " Oh , well , nothing in particular , I guess . It might come in handy for breaking a lock . " " You can always use a brick , " said Bob , but he went . Ish used the momentary delay to pick up the rifle and check that the magazine was full . This was pure routine , but Ish himself was the one who insisted on it . ' There was only a very small chance of meeting a rambunctious bull or a she-bear with cubs , but you took the rifle along for insurance . Ish , at times when he woke up in the night , still remembered very vividly the occasion when the dogs had trailed him . Bob came back , and at once handed the hammer to his father . As Ish gripped the handle , he felt a strange little sense of security . The familiar weight of the dangling four-pound head brought him comfort . It was the same old hammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rattlesnake bit him . The handle had been weathered and cracked then , and it still was . He had often thought of choosing a new handle in some hardware store and fitting it to the head . As a matter of fact he could just as well have picked out a whole new tool . Actually , however , he had very little use for thep210hammer . By tradition he took it along every New Years Day when he cut the numerals into the rock , but that was about its only practicalvalue , and even for that purpose a lighter one might have been better . So now he stuck the hammer into the wagon by his feet , and felt comfortable . " All ready ? " he called to Dick and Bob , and just then some , thing caught his eye . A small boy was standing , half-hidden in the bushes , looking out at the wagons . Ish recognized the slight figure . " Oh , Joey ! " he called on impulse . " Want to go along ? " Joey stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to help digging the well , " he said . " Oh , never mind , they 'll get the well dug without you  --  or " he added to himself " they more likely wo n't get it dug either with or without you . " Joey took no more urging . Obviously this was what he had really been hoping . He ran to Ish 's wagon , and climbed in snugly at his father 's feet where he could just find room . He held the hammer in his lap . Then the clogs were off with a furious rush and an outburst of barking , as they always liked to start out . The two other teams followed , with the excited boys yelling and their dogs barking too . The dogs around the houses barked back . It made a fair imitation of a riot . As always , hunched in the little wagon behind six dogs , Ish felt ridiculous , as if he were acting in some silly pageant . Once the dogs had started , they stopped wasting breath at barking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts , and went over his plans . He made his first stop at what had once been a service station . The door was open . Inside the little office , though it was walled in glass , the sunlight filtered through in subdued yellow . Twentyoneyears of fly-specks and blown dust had coated the windows thickly . He saw the old telephone directory hanging from its hook besidethe long-dead telephone . As he took the book and opened it , bits of brittle yellowed paper broke off from the pages and wentp211fluttering to the floor . He found the address of what had once been the local agency for jeeps . Yes , with the roads in the conditionthey were , a jeep would be the thing . Half an hour later , when they came to the proper street-corner , Ish looked through the dirty display-window , and his heart jumped with boyish excitement at seeing a jeep actually standing there . ' The boys tied up the teams , and the dogs , well-trained , lay ' down in orderly fashion without snarling the traces . Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Ish , " take the hammer , and smash the lock . " " Oh , here 's a brick ! " said Dick , and then went running off down the street toward the remains of a chimney that had fallen in the earthquake . Bob went with him . Ish had a feeling of irritation . What was wrong with those boys ? At best a brick was not as good as the hammer for smashinga door in . He ought to know ; he had smashed a lot of them . He stepped three strides across the sidewalk , and swinging with the hammer on the rhythm of his last stride , he sent the door crashing inwards . That would show them ! After all , there had been sense in bringing the hammer ! The jeep that was standing there in the display-room had four flat tires , and showed a thick layer of dust , but under the dust the red paint was shiny . The speedometer showed a total of nine miles . Ish shook his head . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I mean , she was too new ! One that was better broken in will be easier for us . " In the garage behind the display-room , there were several others . All their tires were flat , extremely flat . One had its hood up and various of its parts were scattered around . It must have been in for a repair-job . Ish passed that one by . There seemed little to choose between the others . The speedometerof one of them stood at six thousand , and Ish decided to try that one . The boys looked at him expectantly , and Ish felt that he was putting himself to the test . " Now remember , " he said defensively , " I do n't know whether can get this thing going or not . I do n't know whether anyonep212could  --  after twenty years and more ! I 'm not even a mechanic , you know ! I was just one of those ordinary fellows who had driven a car quite a lot and could change a tire , or tighten a fan-belt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , first , we might try to see if we can move her . " Ish made sure that the brake was off and the gears in neutral . " All right , " he said . " The tires are flat , and the grease is stiff in the wheel-bearings , and for all I know maybe the bearings themselves have gone flat from standing twenty years the same way . But come on and get behind her , and we 'll shove . This floor is level anyway . . . . All right , now . All together  --  shove ! " The car lurched suddenly forward ! The boys were yelping with pleasure and excitement , and their noise set the dogs to barking . You would have thought it was all over , whereas all that had been proved was that the wheels still would turn . Next Ish put the gear into high , and they shoved again . This was a different story . The car did not budge . The question was now whether the engine and gears were merely stiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Looking under the hood , Ish saw that the engine was well smeared with grease , as engines usually were . There was little sign of external rust , but that might show nothing about what had happened inside . The boys looked at him expectantly , and he thought of expedients . He could try the other car . He could have the boys bring the dog-teams in and hitch them to the car . Then he had another idea . The jeep which had been in the process of being repaired was only some ten feet behind the one they had chosen to try . If they could shove that one forward out of gear , they might send it against the rear of the other with enough momentum to make something give . Also they might smash something , but that was no matter ! They brought this jeep within two feet of the other , and rested . Then , altogether , they shoved again.  |p213There  was a satisfactory bang of metal on metal . Going to look , they found that the first jeep had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with hard pushing , even when it was in gear , Ish began to feel triumphant . " You see , " he said , " once you get something moving it 's easier to keep moving ! " ( Then he wondered whether that principle applied to groups of people , as well as to engines . ) The battery of course was dead , but Ish had faced that problem before . First , however , he gave the boys instructions to drain all oil out of the car and replace it with oil from sealed cans , using the lightest oil available . Leaving them at work , he went off with a dog-team . In half an hour he was back with a battery . He connected it , and turned the key in the ignition switch , watching the needle on the ammeter . Nothing happened . Perhaps the wiring was gone somewhere . But he tapped the ammeter , and the long unused needle suddenlydisengaged and went jiggling over to Discharge . There was life ! He felt around for the starter-button . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real test . . . . Yes , I guess this is the acid test , seeing that that 's what we have in the battery ! " But the boys grinned blankly , never having heard the expression , and Ish found himself a little disturbed that he had been able to make a pun at such a climax . He pressed the starter-button . There was a long grunt . Then slowly the engine turned ! After the first turn it moved more easily , and then more easily still . So far , so good ! The gasoline-tank was empty , like most of them these days . Probably their caps were not air-tight , or else the gasoline seeped through the carburetor  --  Ish did not know . They found gasoline in a drum , and poured five gallons into the tank . Ish put in fresh spark-plugs . He primed the carburetor , feeling a little proud that he knew enough to do so . He got into the seat , set the choke , snapped the ignition on again , and tramped on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then suddenlyroared into life . The boys were shouting . Ish sat triumphantly , nursing the throttle with his foot . He felt a sense of pride in the old achievementsof civilization  --  in all the honest design and honest work of engineers and machinists which had gone into fashioning this engine , fit to work after twenty-some years of idleness . The engine , however , died suddenly when the gas in the carburetorwas exhausted . They primed and ran it again , and still again , and finally the ancient pump brought up gas from the tank , and the engine ran continuously . The problem now  --  and perhaps the worst of all  --  was tires . In the same display-room there was one of the usual tire-racks well raised above the floor . But the tires had been standing uprightfor so long that they had sagged a little under their own weight , and the rubber , where it had rested against the rack , was badly indented . Such tires , even though they might last for a few miles , held obviously little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they finally found some tires which had been resting on their sides , and these seemed to be in better condition , although the rubber was hard and full of little cracks , and gave an impression of being dead . They found a jack , and raised the first wheel from the ground . Even to get the wheel off was a struggle , for the nuts had begun to rust to the threads . Bob and Dick were unaccustomed to the use of tools , and little Joey kept getting in the way with his eagerness , and was more hindrance than help . Even in the Old Times Ish had never demounteda tire except once or twice in an emergency , and he had forgotten the tricks , if he had ever known them . They spent a long time sweating the first tire off the rim . Bob barked a knuckle , and Dick tore a finger-nail half off . Getting the " new " tire onto the rim was even more of a struggle , both because of their clumsiness and because of the tire 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one another and with the whole job , they finished getting this one tire onto the rim.  |p215Just  as they were pausing , triumphant but tired , Ish heard Joey calling to him from across the garage . " What is it , Joey ? " he answered , a little petulantly . " Come here , Daddy . " " Oh , Joey , I 'm tired , " he said , but he went , and the two other boys trailed with him . Joey was pointing at the spare wheel of one of the jeeps . " Look , Daddy , " he said , " why could n't you use that one ? " All Ish could do was to burst out laughing . " Well , boys , " he said to Dick and Bob , " that 's the time we made fools of ourselves ! " The tire on the spare wheel had been suspended in the air all these years , and it was already on a wheel . They had not needed to shift any tires . All they had needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pump them up , and put them on their own jeep . They had done a lot of work for no purpose because they had just barged along and not used their heads . Then Ish , suddenly recognizing his own stupidity , strangely gained a new pleasure . Joey was the one who had seen ! But by now it was time for lunch . They had brought along only their spoons and always essential can-openers . Now they went off to the nearest grocery-store . Like all the others it was a scene of devastation and litter and ruin . A mess ! It was depressing to Ish , even horrible , in spite of the many times he had seen its like . The boys , however , thought nothing of it , never having seen a grocery store in any other state . Rats and mice had chewed into all the cartons , and the floor was deep with the remnants of cardboard and paper , mixed with rodent droppings . Even the toilet paper had been chewed , probablyfor nesting . But the rodents could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottles and cans were undisturbed . They even looked startlingly neat , at first glance , in contrast with the mess elsewhere . When you looked closer , they were not really neat . Droppings were scatteredeven on these shelves , and many labels had been chewed , probably because of the paste beneath the paper . Also the colors had faded , so that the once bright red tomatoes on the labels werep216a sickly yellow , and the rosy-cheeked peaches had almost disappeared . The labels , however , were still readable . At least , Ish and Joey could read them , and the others , though they got stuck on many hard words like apricots and asparagus , could at least tell what was inside by looking at the pictures . They selected what they wanted . The boys were quite ready to sit down in the litter and eat . Ish , however , wanted to get outside . So they went and sat on the curb in the sun . They did not bother with a fire , but ate a cold lunch out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of baked beans , sardines , salmon , liver loaf , corned beef , olives , peanuts , and asparagus . Such a meal , Ish knew , ran high in proteins and fats and low in carbohydrates , but there were few carbohydrates that had been canned or bottled , and the few that you could find , like hominy and macaroni , called for heating . For drink , they had tomato juice . They ate a dessert of canned nectarines and pineapple . When they had finished , they wiped off the spoons and canopenersand put them back into their pockets . The half-empty cans they merely left lying . There was so much litter in the street already that something more did not matter . The boys , Ish was glad to notice , were in a hurry to get back to work at the car . They had apparently begun to feel a little of the intoxication that was likely to come from a mastery over power . He himself was a little tired , and a new idea was shaping in his mind . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dick , I mean . Do you think you can go back and shift those wheels by yourselves ? " " Sure , " said Dick , but he looked puzzled . " What I mean is  --  well , Joey is too little to be much use , and I 'm tired . It 's only four blocks to the City Library from here . Joey can go with me . Want to , Joey ? " Joey was already on his feet with the excitement of the idea . The other boys were happy to get back to the tires . As they walked toward the Library , Joey ran ahead in his eagerness . It was ridiculous , thought Ish , that he had never taken Joeyp217there before . But all this matter of Joey 's reading and intellectual interests had developed very rapidly . Because of his policy of saving the great University Library as a reserve , Ish had been using this library for his own purposes for many years , and had long since forced the lock on the main entrance . Now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his youngest son . They stood in the main reading-room , and then wandered through the stacks . Joey said nothing , but Ish could see his eves drink the titles in as he passed . They came out from the stacks again , and stood in the main lobby by the entrance , looking back . Then Ish had to break the silence . " Well , what do you think of it ? " " Is it all the books in the world ? " " Oh , no ! Just a few of them . " " Can I read them ? " " Yes , you can read any you want to . Always bring them back , and put them in place again , so they wo n't get lost and scat-tered . " " What 's in the books ? " " Oh , something of pretty near everything . If you read them all , you would know a lot . " " I 'll read them all ! " Ish felt a sudden warning shadow fall on the happiness of his mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly read them all , and you would n't want to . There are dull ones and stupid ones and silly ones , and even bad ones . But I 'll help you pick out the good ones . Now , though , we 'd better go . " He was actually glad to get Joey away . The stimulation of seeingso many books so suddenly seemed almost more than was good for the frail little boy . Ish was glad that he had not taken him to the University Library . In due time now he could take him there . As they walked toward the garage , Joey did not run ahead . Thistime he kept close to his father ; he was thinking . Finally he spoke : " Daddy , what is the name of those things that are on the ceil/ings of our rooms  --  like shiny white balls ? You said once they used to make light . " " Oh , those are called electric lights . ' " " If I read the books , could I make them make light again ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately after it a sense of fear . This must not go too fast ! " Well , Jocy , I do n't know , " he said , trying to speak with unconcern . " Maybe you could , maybe not . Things like that take time , and a lot of people working together . You 've got to go slow . " Then they walked without speaking . Ish was proud and triumphantthat Joey had absorbed so much of his own feeling , and yet he was fearful . Joey was moving even too fast . The intellect should not run ahead of the rest of the personality . Joey needed physical strength and emotional solidity . Still , he was going far ! Ish came out of his thoughts to the sound of retching , and saw that Joey was vomiting upon a pile of rubble . " That lunch ! " thought Ish guiltily . " I let him eat too much mixture . He 's done this before . " Then he realized that the excitementhad probably been more a factor than the lunch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the garage , they found that the boys had finished the work of shifting tires and pumping them up . Ish felt his old curiosity about the car and the expedition rising up again . He got into the car , and once more started the engine . He nursed it lovingly , and then raced it a little to let it grow warm . Well , the engine was running and the tires were holding , at least temporarily . But there were a lot of questions about clutch and transmission and steering-gear and brakes , besides all those mysteriousbut vital things which lurked somewhere in the make-up of automobiles and of which he scarcely even knew the names . They had filled the radiator , but the water-circulation might well be clogged somewhere , and even that was enough to render a car of no value . But here we are again worrying about the future ! " All right ! " he said . " Let 's go ! " The engine was muttering contentedly . He threw the clutch out , and worked the stiff transmission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car lurched forward heavily , as if its bearings were almost too stiff to be started again , as if their fine steel balls like the rubber tires , had flattened from long standing in one position . Yet the car moved , and he felt it respond to the stiff steering gear . He pressed upon the brake , and the car came to a stop , having moved only six feet . Yet it had moved , and ( of equal importance ) it had stopped . He had a sudden feeling of more than pleasure , reaching to the height of exaltation . It was not all a dream ! If , in one day 's work a man and three boys could get a jeep to running again , what could not a whole community accomplish in the course of a few years ? The boys unloosed the dogs from one of the wagons to run home by themselves . They hitched the wagon behind one of the others . Then Dick drove one team , and Bob the other . Ish , with Joey beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaps of debris in the street . The blowing winds had drifted leaves and dust upon the bricks , and the winter rains had washed the whole into semblances of natural banks and hillocks . Grass was growing thickly ; on one little mound there was even a fair stand of bushes . Ish steered stiffly hither and thither , finding a way along the debris-clogged streets . He was nearing home when he bumped sharply over a brick and heard a bang as the left rear tire went out . He ended the day driving home on one flat tire , bumping badly , but taking it slowly and making the last grade successfully , a little ahead of the dog teams . In spite of this final mishap , he felt that he had done well . He let the jeep roll to a stop in front of the house , and leaned back in triumphant relief . At least he had got it home . Then he pressed the horn-button , and after all these years of silence it respondedwonderfully  --  TOOT-A-TOOT-TOOT ! He expected children , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the unaccustomed sound , but there was no one . Only a sudden barking of dogs sprang up from everywhere . Then the team-dogs joined in the chorus , as they now came up the bill , and the boys joined him . Ish felt a sudden emptiness of fearP220inside him . Once before , long ago , he had come into a strangely empty town , and blown the horn of his car , and now it was easy enough to think that something might have happened when your whole universe consisted of only some thirty more or less defenselesspeople . But that was only for a moment . Then he saw Mary , her baby on her arm , come unconcernedly out of the house down the street , and wave to him . " They 've all gone bull-dodging ! " she called . The boys were suddenly excited to join the sport . They loosed the dogs from the carts , and were off , not even asking permission of Ish . Even Joey , now wholly recovered from his illness , rushed off with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his triumph at restoring transportation gone suddenly sour in his mouth . Only Mary came to look at the jeep . She stared with big enough eyes , but was as untalkative as the baby , who also stared . Ish got out of the jeep , and stretched . His long legs were cramped from its close quarters , and his bad loin ached from even this small amount of bumping . " Well , " he said with a little pride in his voice , " what do you think of it , Mary ? " Mary was his own daughter , but she was not much like either of her parents , and her stolidity often bothered him . " Good ! " she said with a Choctaw-like imperturbability . Ish felt that there was not much to follow up along that line . " Where 's the bull-dodging ? " he asked . " Down by the big oak tree . " Just then they heard the loud sound of yelling , and Ish knew that someone had made a good maneuver at dodging . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the national sport , " he said , though he knew the irony would be wasted . " Yes , " said Mary , and began to stroll back with her baby towardher own house . Ish went off on the path down the hill , across lots , through what had once been someone 's back yard . " National sport ! " he was still thinking to himself bitterly , although he realized that the bitterness might be partly because his own triumphant entry had been spoiled . He heard another shout from ahead which indicatedP221that again someone put himself within a few inches of the bull 's horns . Bull-dodging was dangerous , too , although actually no one had ever been killed or even badly hurt . Ish rather disapproved of the whole business , but he did not feel that he was in a position to set himself firmly against it . The boys needed some way to get rid of their energy , and perhaps they even needed something dangerous . By and large , life was perhaps too quiet and too safe these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind again  --  too safe and unadventurous life tended to produce stolid people . These days children never had to be warned against crossing the street because of automobiles , and there were dozens of other daily hazards of the old civilization such as the common cold , not to mention atomic bombs , which nobody ever needed to consider . You had the ordinary run of sprains , cuts , and bruises , what you expected among people living largely in the open , and handling tools like hatchets and knives . Once , too , Molly had burned her hands badly , and there had been a near-drowning when a three-year-old had slipped from the pier at fishing . Now he came into the edge of the little open space on the side of the hill , fairly level , close to the flat rock where the numerals of the years were incised . It had once been a park . The bull was being played in the center of the grassy spot . It was not a lawn such as you expected in a park . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and would have been taller if it had not been eaten clown by cattle and elk . Harry , Molly 's fifteen-year-old , was playing the bull , and Ish 's own Walt was backing him up  --  what they called " playing halfback "  --  abit of jargon surviving from the Old Times . Although Ish did not consider himself an expert , his first glance was enough to let him know that this particular bull was not very dangerous . he must have been of almost pure Hereford blood , and still had the red coat with the white face and front markings . Neverthelesshe showed the cumulative effects of ancestors who for twenty-one years had lived as range cattle , knowing no man-supplied shelteror food and surviving as best they could . The legs were longer ; the barrel of the body , slimmer ; the horns , bigger . At the mo-P222ment , there was a pause in the game as the already tiring bull stood uncertain , and Harry was taunting him to charge . At the edge of the glade among the trees on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the community in fact , including Jeanie with her baby . Among the trees they would have no trouble getting out of the road of the bull , if by any chance he should suddenly decide to leave the open ground . There were several dogs to be loosed in an emergency , and Jack sat with a rifle across his knees . The bull suddenly came to life , and charged ponderously uphillwith enough power to have wiped out twenty boys . But Harry dodged neatly , and the bull came to a halting stop , uncertain and confused . A little girl ( she was Jean 's Betty ) sprang suddenly from the group , and cried out that she wanted to take over . She was a wild , dashing little figure , her skirts tucked up high around her thighs , her long sun-tanned legs flashing back and forth in the sunshine . Harry yielded place to his half-sister . The bull was tired now , and fit for a girl to take over . Betty , aided by Walt , managed to provoke a few charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suddenly , a little boy cried out loudly , " I 'm going in ! " It was Joey . Ish frowned , but he knew that he would not have to exert himself to forbid it . Joey was only nine , and it was strictly against the rules for anyone so young to try bull-dodging , even as halfback . The older boys enforced this discipline quickly enough . They were kindly , but firm . " Aah , Joey , " said Bob from his age of sixteen , " you 're not big enough yet . You 've got to wait a couple of years , anyway . " " Yeah ? " said Joey . " I 'm as good as Walt is , anyway . " The way he said it , suggested to Ish that Joey might have been doing a little practice on his own , sneaking off to find some easylookingbull and playing it for a while , perhaps with the aid of Josie , his devoted twin sister . Ish felt a quick coldness pass through him at the thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a few more half-hearted protests , however , Joey had to subside . P223By this time the bull , fat from the good grazing , was thoroughly tired and winded . He stood , only pawing the grass a little , while the wildly cavorting Betty swarmed around him , and even turned a handspring . But the sport was obviously over , and the spectators began to drift off . The older boys called to Betty and Walter . Suddenly the bull , much to his relief doubtless , was merely left standing alone in the center of the grassy spot . Back at the houses , Ish went to look at the well , to see how much work had been done during the day . He found that it had been sunk only a foot or so . Shovels and picks were left scatteredabout . All too obviously , the easygoing nature of the communityand the special attraction of bull-dodging had prevented much labor being performed . Ish looked at the shallow hole a little grimly . Yet during the day enough water had been carted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes . At dinner the veal roast was extremely good , and the only thing lacking to make a really excellent meal for Ish was that his Napa Gamay had soured a little in the bottle , after standing for better than a quarter-century , if the vintage-date on the label could be trusted . P224He planned that the boys should leave on the fourth day . That was another difference between the Old Times and these now . Then it was all so complicated that anything importanthad to be worked out a long time ahead ; now you just decided on something , and did it . Besides , the season of the year was favorable , and he feared that delay would only permit the enthusiasm for the expedition to seep away . Throughout the intervening days he kept the boys busy . He practiced them at driving . He took them to the garage again , and picked up some spare parts , such as a fuel-pump and a coil . To the best of his ability he showed them how to change parts , and they practiced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you might find it easier , if you have trouble , to stop in at some garage and get another one running , just as we did here . That might be easier than to try patching this one . " But most of all Ish enjoyed the planning of the route . In the service stations he found road maps , yellow and faded . He studiedP225them eagerly , bringing into play his old knowledge of the land , trying to imagine how flood and windstorm and tree-growth would have affected the roads at different points . " Head south first , for Los Angeles , " he concluded finally . " That was a big center of population in the Old Times . There are probablysome people left , maybe a community . " On the map he let his glance run southward toward Los Angeles , following the old familiar red lines of the routes . " Try 99 first , " he said . " You can probably get through . If it 's blocked in the mountains turn back toward Bakersfield and work across to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He paused , and in the pause he suddenly felt his throat tight , and his eyes brimming . Nostalgia filled him . The names , it must have been , that did it ! Burbank , Hollywood , Pasadena  --  once they had been living towns . He had known them . Now coyotes hunted jack-rabbits through their drought-stricken parks and back-lots . Yet all the names still stood out black and plain on the maps . He swallowed and winked , for he saw the two boys looking at him. " 0 . K. , " he said briskly . " From Los Angeles , or from Barstow , if you ca n't make Los Angeles , take 66 east . That was the way I went . Across the desert , things should be easy . But watch your water . If the Colorado River bridge is there , well and good . If not , swing north and try the road across Boulder Dam . The dam will be there still , certainly . " On the maps he showed them how to figure out alternate routes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jeep he thought that they could usually get through with no more than the occasional cutting back of a fallen tree , or an hour 's work with pick and shovel to make a track across a landslide . After all , even in twenty-one years , the great highways would not be entirely blocked . " You may have some trouble in Arizona , " he went on . " After you get to the mountains , but then .... " " What 's Arry  --  ? What is it ?  --  Arry-zone-a ? " Bob was asking , and it was a fair enough question . But Ish found himself stumped to answer it . What Arizona once hadp226been  --  even that was a hard one . Had it been a certain amount of territory , or had it been essentially a corporate entity , an abstraction . Even so , how could he explain in a few words what a " state " had been ? Much less , how could he explain what Arizona now was ? " Oh , " he said finally , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over there beyond the river . " Then he had an inspiration , " See , on the map it 's this part inside the yellow line . " " Yes , " said Bob , " I suppose they had a fence around it ? " " Well , I doubt whether they had . " " That 's right . They would n't have needed a fence where the river was . ( Let it pass , thought Ish . He thinks Arizona is like an old fenced-in backyard , only bigger . ) After that , however , he stopped referring to states , and mentionedcities . The boys knew what a city was , that is , it was a lot of littered streets and weather-beaten buildings . Of course , since they themselves lived in a city , they could easily imagine another city and another community like their own . He routed them through Denver , Omaha , and Chicago , wanting to see what would have happened in the great cities . By that time it would be spring . Beyond that , he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the route that seemed the most passable . " The Pennsylvania Turnpike may still be the best way to get across the mountains . It will he hard to block a four-lane highway like that , and even the tunnels should still be open . " For the return route he left them to their own choice ; by that time they would know more about conditions than he did . He suggested , however , that they swing far to the south , since on account of the cold winters there would probably have been a drift of population toward the Gulf Coast . They drove the jeep every day , and thus , by the process of eliminationthrough blow-outs , they got tires which seemed likely to stand up under some wear . On the fourth day they left , the back of the jeep jammed with an extra battery , tires , and other equipment ; the boys themselves , P227half-wild with the excitement of the prospect ; their mothers , close to tears at the thought of so long a separation ; Ish himself , nervous with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fences , drew lines that were hard and uncompromising . They too were man-made , abstractions dominatingreality . Where you crossed by the highway , on a line , the road-surface changed . It was smooth in Delaware , but when you went into Maryland , you felt a change in vibration , and all at once the tires hummed differently . " State line , " the sign read . " Entering Nebraska . Speed limit 6o M. P. H. " So even right and wrong altered with the sharp snap of a discontinuity , and you stepped harder on the throttle . At the national boundary the flags showed different colors , though the same breeze blew them . You stopped for customs and immigration , and were suddenly a stranger , unfamiliar . " Look , " you said , " that policeman has a different uniform ! " You got new money , and even for picture post-cards the stamps had to have another face on them . " Better drive extra carefully , " you said . " Would n't be good to get arrested over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped across a line you could n't see , and then you were one of those queer people  --  a foreigner ! But boundaries fade even faster than fences . Imaginary lines need no rust to efface them . Then there will be no quick shifts , and adjustments , and perhaps it will be easier on the mind . They will say as in the beginning : " About where the oaks start to get thin , and the pines take over . " They will say : " Over across there  --  ca n't tell exactly  --  in the foothills where it gets drier and you start seeing sage-brush . " After the boys had left , there seemed to be a settling down into another one of those calm and happy periods which had led them to name one certain time the Good Year . Day after day things drifted , week after week . The rains held on late  --  hard showers , quickly clearing afterwards , with fine blue weather , so that the farofftowers of the Golden Gate Bridge stood out clean-etched and still majestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually managed to herd enough of them together to get some work done on the well . Their first shaft hit bed rock before water , for on the slope of the hill the soil was thin . But they managed to take the second shaft down until they struck a good flow . They walled the well in with planking , and covered it , and rigged a hand-pump . By this time , they had all become accustomed to using the outhouses , and the thought of the labor involved to make the toilets work again by means of pipes and tanks and hand-pumping seemed more than was worthwhile . And so they put it off . The fishing was good now . Everyone wanted to go fishing , and other matters seemed to take second place . In the evenings , they often gathered together , and sang songs to the accompaniment of Ish 's accordion . I-He sometimes suggested that they should try singing parts . When they did , old George carried a good resonant bass , and the others caught on to the idea , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , Ish decided again as he had decided long before , they were not a very musical group . Years before , he had tried bringing home records of symphonies and playing them on the wind-up phonograph . Such rendition of course was not very good ; even so , you could follow the themes . But he never got the children interested . At some melodic passage they might leave off their own playing or wood-carving and look up , listening with pleasure for a moment . As soon , however , as the development became a little complicated , the children went back to their own play . Well , what could you expect of merely a few average people and their descendents ? ( No , a little better than average , he insisted  --  but possibly not in musical appreciation . ) In the Old Times one American in a hundred might have had a deep or real appreciation of Beethoven , and those few were probably just among those more sophisticated and intense people who , like the more highly bred dogs , had apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disaster . As an experiment , he also tried jazz records . At the loud blare of the saxophones , the children again left off their own enterprises , but again the interest had been momentary . Le jazz hot ! It too , with all its involuted rhythms , had been a sophistication ; it ap/pealed , not to a simple and primitive mind , but to one that was highly developed and specialized , at least along that particular line . You might as well expect the children to appreciate Picasso or Joyce . In fact  --  and this was something that encouraged him  --  the younger generation showed little interest in listening to the phonographat all ; they preferred to do their own singing . He took this as a good sign : that they would rather participate than listen , rather be actors than audience . They failed , however , to take the next step and compose tunes and words of their own . Ish himself occasionally tried making up a verse with topical references , but either he had no knack for it or else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition . So they sang in unison against the background of the standardizedchords and bumping bass of the accordion . The simpler tunes , he observed , they liked the best . The words seemed to make little difference . They sang " Carry me back to old Virginny " although they had no idea what " Virginny " was or who was asking to be carried back . They sang " Halleluiah , I 'm a bum ! " without caring what a bum was . They sang plaintively of Barbara Allen although none of them had even known of unrequited love . Often , in those weeks , Ish thought of the two boys in the jeep . Perhaps the children would call for " Home on the Range , " and as his left hand shifted to the G-buttons , he would have a sudden thought , and a pang with it . Just now Bob and Dick might be somewhere far out in the old range country . Playing mechanically , he would wonder . Were the deer and the antelope playing there now ? Or was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often , however , thoughts of the boys came to him in the dark hours of the night when some dream , caused by his very anxiety , brought him out of sleep in sudden tenor to lie nervouslyconsidering possibilities . How could he ever have let them try it ? He thought of all the dangers of flood and storm . And the car ! You could never trust young fellows with a car , and even though there was no dangerp230from traffic , they might run off the road . There would be many bad places . The boys would take chances . There would be mountain-lions and bears and bad-tempered bulls . Bulls were worst of all , because they never seemed to have lost a certain contempt for men , sprung perhaps from age-old familiarity . No  --  more likely , the car would break down . Then they would be marooned , hundreds or even thousands of miles away ! But what raised the worst shivers in Ish at such moments in the night was the thought of men ! What people might the boys encounter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances , unrestrained by any fly-wheel of tradition ! There might be communities with universal and death-dealing hostility to the stranger . Outlandish religious rites might have developed  --  human sacrifice , cannibalism ! Perhaps , like Odysseus himself , the two youngsters would encounter lotus-eaters and sirens and unspeakable Laestrygonians . This community of their own , here on the hillside , might be stodgy and dull and uncreative , but it had at least preserved the human decencies . That was no guarantee that other communitieshad done the same . But in the morning light , all these bug-a-boos of the darkness lost their reality . Then he thought of the two boys as enjoying themselves , stimulated by new scenes , perhaps by new people . Even if the car should break down and they were unable to start another one , still they could walk back over the same road they had driven . There would be no lack of food . Twenty miles a day , at least a hundred a week  --  even if they had to walk a thousand miles , they should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car running , they should be home a great deal sooner . When he thought of it , he could scarcely contain himself for excitement at the thought of all the news they would bring . So the weeks passed , and the rains were over . The grass on the hills lost its fresh greenness , and then seeded and turned brown . In the mornings the low summer clouds hung so close that the towers of the bridges sometimes reached up into them . P231As time passed , Ish stopped thinking , and dreaming , so much about the two boys . Their being gone so long seemed to show that they had traveled far . It was barely time to expect their return from a transcontinental journey , and certainly not time to begin worrying over their failure to return . Other thoughts , and worries , occupied his mind . He had reorganized the school , and was back at what he felt to be his essential work of teaching the young ones to read and write and work a little arithmetic , and thus to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization . But the young ones , ungratefully , fidgeted on their chairs , and looked restlessly toward the windows , and he knew that they wanted to be outside , running on the hillside , playing at bull-dodging , fishing . He tried various lures , attempting the techniques which in the old days he remembered had been called " progressive education . "  |p232Wood-carving  ! Curiously to Ish , wood-carving had become the chief means of artistic expression . Obviously this was a heritage from old George . Perhaps , stupid as he was , George had unconsciouslymanaged to pass along to the children his love of wood-working . Ish himself had no interest in it , and no knack . No matter what it had come from ! Could he , Ish , as a teacher , make use of this hobby to stimulate an intellectual interest ? So he began to teach them geometry , and to show them how with compass and ruler they could lay out designs on the surface of the wood . The bait took , and soon with great enthusiasm everyone talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a geometricaldesign , and was eagerly carving . Ish himself became interested . He felt the fascination of the work as the mellow sugarpineblock  --  aged for almost a quarter century  --  began to peel off from his knife-edge . But even before the first geometrical designs were executed , the children were losing interest . To draw your knife along the edge of a steel square and thus get a straight line  --  that was easy and uninteresting . To follow the outline of a circle  --  that was difficult enough , but was mechanical and dull . And the designs when finished , even Ish had to admit , looked like bad imitations of oldtimemachine-work . The children reverted to free-running handwork , often improvisingas they went . It was more fun to do , and in the end it looked better also . Best of them all at carving was Walt , although he could never read , except in a halting stammer . But when it came to doing a frieze of cattle on the smooth surface of a plank , Walt carved with sure touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to use the tricks of geometry . If his row of three cows did not quite fill up the space , he merely carved a calf at the end of the line to take up what was left . And yet , when he had finished , it all looked as if he had planned it from the beginning . He could work in low relief , or in three-quarters , or even sometimes in the full round . The children admired his work , and him , tremendously.  |p233So  , Ish realized , he had failed in what had seemed his shrewdly planned attempt at using a hobby to stimulate an intellectual interest , and again he was left with little Joey . Joey had no talent at wood-carving , but of them all , only he had kindled at those eternal truths of line and angle which had survived even the Great Disaster . Once Ish found him cutting different-shaped triangles from pieces of paper and then recutting the ends from each triangle and placing them together to from a straight line . " Does it always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You said it always would . " " Why do you do it then ? " Joey could not explain why he did it , but Ish shared enough of the workings of his son 's mind to be sure that Joey must be really paying a kind of homage to universal and unchangable truth . He was as much as saying to the powers of chance and change : " Here , make this one come out different , if you can ! " And when those dark powers could not prevail , it was again a triumph for intellect . So Ish was left with little Joey  --  spiritually , and sometimes also physically . For , when the other children ran out of school whoopingloudly , Joey often made a point of not going , but of sitting with some biggish-looking book , and even seeming a little superiorin his attitude . Physically , the other boys were stalwart young giants , and Joey lagged at all sports and outdoor adventures . His head seemed big for his body , though that might be , Ish realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of knowledge . His eyes also were big for his head , and exceptionally quick and alert . Alone among the children , he suffered from sick spells , with an upset stomach . Ish wondered whether these attacks were truly physical or sprang from some emotional disturbance , but since there was no chance of sending Joey to either a doctor or a psychiatrist , the actuality would never be known . In any case , Joey remained underweight , and often came home exhausted after playing with the other boys . " It 's not good ! " said Ish to Em . " No , " said Em , " but still , you like him interested in books andp234geometry . That 's merely the other side of his not being as strong as the others . " Yes , I suppose so . He has to find his satisfaction somewhere . But still I wish he would get to be stronger . " " You would n't really have him different , would you ? " And , as she went away about some other matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " he thought , " we have plenty of galumphing young huskies . Still I wish he were stronger . Yet , even if he is something of a weakling , and even a freak and a pedant , we must have one person like that , to carry on intellectually . " And so , of all his children , his heart went out to Joey . He saw in Joey the hope of the future , and he talked often with him , and taught him many things . Thus the school dragged along through those weeks while they waited for Dick and Bob to return . Even Ish could hardly use a more optimistic word than " dragged . " Altogether there were eleven children whom he taught , or tried to teach , that summer . He held school in the living-room , and the eleven children came there from all the houses . The session lasted only from nine to twelve , with a long recess . Ish realized that he must ride them with a light rein . He taught them arithmetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pill of geometry . He tried to make practicalapplications of arithmetic , and found it surprisingly difficult . " If A builds 30 feet of fence . . . " the old book read . But nobody built any fences now , and he found himself having to start by explaining why people once had built them  --  a much more complicated matter to explain than you would think , until you tried it . He thought of emulating the progressive school again by setting up a shop where the pupils could buy and sell and keep accounts . But this was not practical , for there were no more storekeepersnow . He would have had to start with a whole exposition of ancient economics . Then he tried valiantly to present to them some of the wonders of pure number . For himself , indeed , he was successful , and the more he tried to tell it to the children the more he himself feltp235the basic quality of mathematics to all that had been civilization . At the same time , he felt more and more , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lay in the relations of one number to another . " Why is it , " he would think , " that two and two eternally make four  --  and not , sometimes , five ? That has not changed ! Even though wild bulls bellow and fight in Union Square ! " Thus too , he played games with triangular numbers , showing the way they built up one on top of the other . But except for Joey the children showed no sense of wonder , and Ish saw their sidelong looks toward the windows when he tried to impress them with it all . He attempted geography also . This , his own subject , he should at least be well qualified to teach . The boys enjoyed drawing maps of the near-by country . But neither boys nor girls were interested in the geography of the world as a whole . Who could blame them ? Perhaps when Dick and Bob came back in the jeep , there might be more interest . But just now the children 's horizon was limited to the few miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe with all of its peninsulas ? What to them , the islands of the sea ? He made a somewhat better case for history , although what he taught was more anthropology than history . He told them of all the growth of man , that struggling creature , who had gradually learned this , learned that , learned to develop himself here , and restrain himself there , and through infinite error and trouble and foolishness and cruelty , at last had achieved so spectacularly beforethe end came upon him . They were mildly interested . Yet most of his time he spent at teaching them to read and write , because reading he felt was the key to everything else and writing was its counterpart . But only Joey took naturally to reading , and romped ahead . He knew the meanings of words , and grasped even the meaning of books . Civ-vil-eye-za-shun ! That is what Uncle Ish talks about . There are lots of quail by the stream today . Two-and-six ? I know that ! They should I say it to him ? Two-and-nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers . It is the same as " a lot . " Uncle George isp236more fun than Uncle Ish . He can show you how to carve . My daddy is more fun still . He says funny things . But Uncle Ish keeps the hammer . It is there now on the mantel . Joey makes up stories about the hammer , I think . You ca n't be sure . I would like to pinch Betty now , but Uncle Ish would not like it . Uncle Ish knows most of anybody . Sometimes I am afraid . If I could tell him what seven and nine is , maybe we would have civ-vil-eye-zashun , and I could see the pictures that act like people . Daddy used to see them . It would be fun . Eight-and-eight . Joey knows right oft . Joey is no good at finding quail nests . Soon we can go now . In spite of recurrent discouragement , Ish still kept trying , and he always fastened quickly on any opportunity that the children themselves seemed to offer him . One afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual , and the next morning they brought with them to school some native walnuts . They had not seen such nuts before , and were curious . Ish quickly decided to crack some of the nuts , and thus perhaps give a little lesson in biology . It would be taking advantage of the children 's own curiosity , and would be following up something that they themselves had initiated . He sent Walt outside for two stones to use in cracking the hard shells . Walt returned with two half bricks  --  bricks and stones not being distinguished in his vocabulary . Ish ignored that detail , but he found that trying to break the hard shells with a brick was more likely to result in a smashed finger than a smashed nut . He cast around for something better to use , and his eyes fell upon his hammer . It was standing , as usual , on the mantelpiece . " Go get the hammer for me , Chris ! " he said , pointing , to the little boy who was nearest it . Usually Chris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and do something active . But now a strange thing occurred . Chris glanced this way and that , at Walt and at Weston , who were next to him . He looked embarrassed , or alarmed . " Go get the hammer , Chris ! " Ish repeated , thinking that pos-P237sibly Chris had been clay-dreaming , and had merely heard his name without noting the words that went before . " I  --  I do n't want to ! " said Chris , hesitantly . Chris was eight years old , and not given to being a cry-baby , and yet Ish could see that Chris was , for some reason , close to tears . He dropped the matter with Chris . " Bring me the hammer , one of you others , " he said . Weston looked at Walt , and Barbara and Betty , the sisters , looked at each other too . Those four were the oldest . All four of them looked back and forth , and did not make a move to rise . Naturally , the little ones did nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at each other . Although Ish was wholly puzzled , he saw no reason to make an issue of the matter , and he was just about to get the hammer himself when something else strange began to happen . Joey rose . He walked over toward the mantelpiece . All the childrens ' eyes followed him . The room , Ish realized , was deathly quiet . Joey stood at the mantelpiece . He reached out his hand , and took the hammer . There was a strange little cry from one of the smaller girls . In the hush that followed , Joey walked back from the mantelpiece , and gave the hammer to Ish . Joey went back to where he had been sitting . The room was still , and the children were looking at Joey . Joey sat down , and Ish broke the silence by pounding on a nut with the hammer . At that noise the tension , whatever it was , seemed to break . Only after it had come to noon and he had dismissed school slid Ish have time to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the conclusion that it had been a case of pure superstition . The hammer  --  all the children associated it vaguely with something strange and mystical in the far past ! It was used on state occasions ; it stood on the mantelpiece by itself . Generally speaking , no one touched it except Ish . Even Bob , Ish now remembered , had handled it with reluctance on that occasion when they had started out with the dog-teams . The children had conic to think it an implement of power , dangerous for any of them to touch . He could see how such an idea might have begun half seriously as a game and in a few years have cone to be takenP238seriously . And as for Joey , again he realized that Joey was the one who stood out from the crowd . Perhaps Joey had not rationallyfigured out that Ish 's hammer was only like any other hammer . Perhaps , he had merely let his superstition work at a higher level , and assumed that he had something in common with his father , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the High Priest 's child , the Son of the Blessing , might touch the relics which would blast the others . Possibly even , he might be capable of it , Joey had helped build up the superstition in the others in order to build up his own importance . It could not be much work , Ish decided , to overcome this superstition . Yet that same afternoon he began to have doubts . On the sidewalk in front of the house some children were playing . As they played , they were jumping from one block of the sidewalk to another and crying out that old rhyme : Step on a crack , Break your mother 's back ! Ish had heard children singing it often in the Old Times . It meant nothing then , just a little childish rhyme . Children , as they got older , had always learned that such things were merely childish . But now , he thought , what would there be to teach the children that such things were mere superstition ? Here was a society with almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to develop its traditions greatly by reading . He sat in his easy-chair in the living-room , and heard the children , outside , playing and shouting their rhyme . As the smoke of his cigarette curled up , he remembered more and more disturbingevidences of superstition . Ezra carried his pocket piece , the old Victorian penny , and doubtless the children looked on that much as they looked on the hammer . Molly was a confirmed rapper on wood ; Ish was disturbed when , now that he considered , he remembered the children also rapping on wood . Would they ever learn that that was just the thing that someone did to make himself feel more comfortable , although it had no real meaning ? Yes , he reluctantly concluded , this matter of the children 's beliefs was extremely serious . In the Old Times the beliefs heldP239by the children of any family or small group of families might be momentous enough , but still those children on growing up would come into contact with other beliefs and make adjustments . Besides , there had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  thetradition of Christianity , or of Western civilization , or of Indo-European folkways , or of Anglo-American culture . Call it what you wished , it was still so tremendous that you might say it was omnipotent , for good or bad absorbing the individual . But now their little community had lost much of the tradition . Part of it had been lost because no seven survivors ( Evie did not count ) could preserve and transmit all of it . Part had been lost because for so long a time there had been no big children to pass on the tradition to the small ones . The oldest of the younger generation had been taught games by their parents , not by older comrades . The community should therefore be plastic to an unprecedenteddegree . This was an opportunity , but also a responsibility  --  anda danger . It would be a danger  --  and he shuddered at the thought  --  if any evil force , such as demagogue , should begin to work . To be sure , he recollected wryly , he had not found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might be only that a stronger force  --  the whole environment  --  was already working against his efforts . But take now again this matter of superstition . Perhaps this had all grown up because , as it happened , there was no one in The Tribe who was creatively religious . Perhaps there was some kind of vacuum in the childish mind , and it had to be filled up with supernatural beliefs . Perhaps all this represented some kind of subconscious straining toward an explanation of the basis of life itself . Years ago they had organized those church services , and then discontinued them as meaningless . That discontinuance might have been a mistake . Now , more certainly even than before , he knew that he had the opportunity to be the founder of a religion for a whole people . What he told the children in school , they would probably believe . He could insure their memory of it by mere insistence andP240iteration . He could tell them that the Lord God created the world in six days , and found it good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian legend that the world was the work of Old Man Coyote . They would believe . Yet what could he really tell them in honesty ? He might tell them any one of half a dozen theories of cosmogony which he remembered from his old studies . Probably they would believe these too , although their complications did not make for quite as good a story as one of those others . Actually , no matter what he said , it might easily be twisted and made into some kind of religion . Again , as years before , he revoltedfrom the idea , for he treasured the honesty of his own skepticism . " It 's better , " he thought in words , remembering some bit of reading , " to have no opinion of God at all than to have one that is unworthy of Him . " He lighted another cigarette , and settled back into the chair again ... Yet this matter of the vacuum ! It worried him . Unless it could be positively filled , his own descendants at the third or fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terror of witchcraft , and experimenting with ritualistic cannibalism . They might believe in voodoo , in shamanism , in taboo . . . He started , almost guiltily . Yes , already there were beliefs in The Tribe which approached the intensity of taboo , and he himself was inadvertently their chief author . There was the matter of Evie , for instance . He and Em and Ezra had talked it over long ago . They wanted no half-witted children of Evie 's  --  to be a care and drag . So they had made her , at least for the boys , a kind of untouchable . Evie , with her blond hair and startled blue eyes , was perhaps the best-looking girl of them all . But Ish was sure that none of the boys had even seriously considered her . Probably they had no specific idea that anything would happen to them if they did , but such action was merely outside their scope of imagination . The prohibition was stronger than law . Such a one you could only call taboo . Again , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disruption of quarrels arising from jealousy , the older men had not so much taught marital fidelity as assumed it . Young people had been married at the earliest possible moment . Ezra 's bigamy , having always been present , was not questioned . Although Ish did not doubt the utility of this practice for their particular situation , still its acceptance as a matter of faith rather than of reason seemed to come close to taboo . The first violation  --  and there would surely be one  --  might bring a tremendous shock . A third possible example of taboo , though a minor matter perhaps , was the turning of the University Library into a sacrosanct building . Once , when the oldest boys were youngsters , Ish had gone with them on a long walk which had taken them to the campus . While he was napping , two of them had worked loose a board which , long before , he had nailed across the broken window ; they had gone into the stacks , and started throwing books onto the floor . Horror-stricken with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ish had followed them . He had been ashamed of himself later , but at the moment he had been outraged beyond reason and had beaten the boys . The very unreasoning quality of his rage and horror must have impressed them much more than the beating . They had certainly passed this impression on to the younger children . The Library had been safe , and Ish had been pleased . But this might also be called an example of taboo , and now lie wondered . There was a fourth one too , of course  --  but this brought him back to where he had started . He got out of the chair and went to the mantelpiece . The hammer was there , as he himself had replaced it . He had not asked any child to take it back , not even Joey . He had preferred not to raise the issue again . There it stood , balanced on its four-pound head of dull , rustpittedsteel . The hammer had been with him a long time . He had found it just before the rattlesnake had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oldest friend . It had been with him longer than Em or Ezra . He looked at it curiously , considering it carefully and self-consciously . The handle was actually in bad shape . It had weatheredP242from lying so long in the open , and even before the hammer had been left to lie , the handle had apparently been banged accidentally against a rock and cracked a little . What was the wood ? He really did not know . Ash or hickory , he supposed . Hickory , most likely . The simplest thing , he concluded impetuously , would be to get rid of the hammer . He could throw it into the Bay . No , he reconsidered , that would be merely treating the symptom , not the disease . With the hammer removed , the children 's tendency to superstition would still remain , and would merely fix upon something else , and perhaps take some more sinister form . He thought of destroying the hammer , as a symbolical lesson to the children that it had no strength in itself . But he remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The handle he could burn easily , but the steel head was next to indestructible by any means at his disposal . Even if he found a carboy of acid and dissolved the steel in it , to go to so much trouble would make the children think that the hammer must really have possessedsome deep-seated power . So he looked at the hammer with new interest , as something which was coming to have a life and power of its own . Yes , it had the qualities which went toward the making of a good symbol  --  permanence , entity , strength . Its phallic suggestion was obvious . Curiously , as he thought now , he had never named it , though men were likely to give names to weapons , which also were symbols of power  --  Madelon and Brown Bess and Killdeer and Excalibur . Hammers had been signs of godhead before this ; Thor had carried a hammer , probably other gods too . Among kings there had been that old Frankish one who drove back the Saracens  --  Martel , they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hammer ! Thus , for one reason or another , when the children reassembled in school the next morning , Ish said nothing about superstition . It would be better , he told himself , to bide his time a little , to observe more closely for a day or two , or a week . Most of all , he wished to learn more about Joey . As the result of this observation , over a period of some weeks , Ish came to the conclusion , somewhat reluctantly , that JoeyP243had many of the qualities of a first-class brat . He had passed his tenth birthday during the summer . His precocity was sometimes painful ; he was , in the old phrase , " too big for his britches . " In age , he was half way between Walt and Weston , who were twelve , and Chris , who was eight . But Joey 's precocity put him naturally into the company of the two older boys , and he and the younger one had nothing in common . This must be hard on Joey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attain the physical power of boys two years older and naturally stronger as well . Josey , his own twin , he neglected also , for he was at a stage when boys had no interest in girls , and Josey , besides , was not nearly so bright as he . There was thus , Ish saw , always a kind of strain about what Jocy was doing or trying to do . Again and again Ish thought of that little incident in which the other children had been afraid to pick up the hammer , but had acquiesced in Joey 's doing something that they themselves did not dare to do . Obviously , in their minds , there was some kind of power inherent in Joey . Ish thought far back to the times of his studies , and he remembered the widespreadbelief that certain members of a tribe had a special power within them . Mana , the anthropologists had called it . Perhaps the children believed that Joey had mina ; possibly Joey himself believed it . Yet , though Ish recognized Joey 's limitations and disabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more on Joey than on any of the others . Joey held the hope for the future . Only by the power of intelligence , Ish believed firmly , had mankindever risen to civilization , and only by further exercise of that same power , would mankind ever rise again . And Joey possessed intelligence . Possibly also he possessed that other power . Mana might be a fallacy of simple minds , but even the most civilized peoples had realized that certain individuals carried within them some strange power that went for leadership . Had anyone ever explained why certain men became leaders , and others , though they seemed better qualified , did not ? How much of all this did Joey realize ? Many times Ish asked himself the question , but he could not as yet answer it . Yet moreP244and more , as the summer progressed , he felt that in Joey lay the hope of the future . All mysticism aside ! All idea of mana discounted ! Still , only Joey could keep the light burning through this dark time . Only he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But mere acquisition of knowledge was not all in which Joey excelled . Even though he was only ten , he was beginning to branch out for himself , to experiment , to discover things on his own . Indeed , that was the way he had really taught himself to read in the beginning . To be sure , all this development was still at a childish level . There was that matter of the jig-saw puzzles , for instance . The children had developed a sudden craze for the puzzles , and had set about rifling some of the stores . Ish had watched them at their play , and at first Joey had not been as good as the others . He seemed to lack some basic spatial sense . Sometimes he tried to join pieces which obviously did not fit , and the others indignantlytold him so . Joey had been irked at his inferiority , and for a while had withdrawn from the game . Then Joey had suddenly got a new idea of how to go about it . He collected himself a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to put them together more rapidly and make better progress than the other children . When he proudly displayed what he had done , the others were impressed . But even after he had explained his system , they did not want to adopt it . " What 's the use anyway ! " Weston had argued . " We might be able to do it faster your way , but it would n't be any more fun , and nobody cares how soon we get this finished . " Betty had agreed . " Yes , it 's no fun just going through all the work , picking up the yellow pieces and the blue pieces and the red pieces , and putting them in different places ! " Joey , Ish noticed , could not put up a good argument for his method , and yet Ish could understand his motives . In the first place , granted there was no need to finish the puzzle in a hurry , still to work efficiently was just as natural and as pleasant for Joey as not to crawl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn-P245petitive spirit , the old-time drive , so characteristic of Americans , for getting to the front . Lacking a native gift for distinguishing shapes , really as much a physical endowment as having strong muscles , he had seen the way to take the lead by intellectual means . He had " used his head , " as they once had liked to say . Though the " discovery " was at all remarkable only because made by so young a child , still Ish was pleased to note that it was the discovery of one phase of classification , that basic tool of man 's progress . Logic rested upon classification ; language , too  --  by its nouns and verbs grouping things and actions into neat workable compartments . Only by his discovery of classification had man been able to impose some workable degree of order upon the infinite apparent disorder of the natural world . Ish saw Joey 's experimental mind also at work with language , To him language was not merely a practical matter , an unconsciousimplement used to express wants and feelings . Language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , a sense of puns and of rhymes , although none of the other children showed much interest in such things . He liked riddles . One day Ish heard him asking a riddle of , the other children . " I made this one up myself , " Joey was saying proudly . " Why are a man , a bull , a fish , and a snake all alike ? " The other children were not much interested . " Because they all eat things , " Betty suggested languidly . " That 's too simple , " said Joey . " Everything eats things . Birds cat things too . " They made one or two other suggestions , and then there came up a suggestion to run off and do something else . Joey saw that he was in immediate danger of losing his audience ; to prevent complete anticlimax , he had to come out with his own answer . " Why , they 're all alike because not one of them can fly ! " At the moment Ish was not impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards , he felt that it was a highly developedand curious kind of ten-year-old mind which could evolve the idea of negative likeness . And into Ish 's mind popped suddenlyan old definition : " Genius is the capacity for seeing what is not there . " Of course , like every other definition of genius , P246that one could be shot to pieces also , because it obviously includedthe madman , as well as the genius . Yet there might be something in it , too ; the great thinkers of the world must necessarilyhave made their reputations by sensing what was not there and looking for it and discovering it , but the first requisite for making the discovery , unless it depended upon mere luck , was the realization that something unseen was there to be discovered , something lacking in the picture . This was Joey 's summer for experiment apparently , and one day he came home reeling strangely and with a strong smell of liquor on his breath . The story came out that he , along with Walt and Weston , had visited one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was a problem that Ish had often considered . He had once even gone into one of the stores and started opening and emptying the bottles . After an hour 's work , however , he had found that he had made too little progress ; the project was obviously impossible , and the children must take their chances with an unlimited liquor supply . And yet , when he thought about it , the situation for his children was not so different from that which he himself had experienced . In those days his father had always had a shelf holding a bottle or two of whiskey and brandy and sherry , and there would have been nothing to stop Ish from carrying on a clandestine experiment of his own . He had not , and so also his own children and grandchildren apparently were not greatly attracted by the unlimited stores available to them . In fact , drunkenness had never been a problem in the community at all . Perhaps the simpler life they were leading took away the need for such stimulation , or perhaps the mere fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , removed the lure of difficulty which had previously surrounded it . As for Joey , Ish was pleased to see that the little fellow had still been sufficiently clever to drink only a small amount  --  not enough to make him really sick or even to make him pass out . He had obviously again been showing off before the older boys , and had again succeeded in impressing them ; they had come home in worse shape than he . Nevertheless Joey was definitely tipsy , and made no objection top247being put immediately to bed . Ish took the opportunity to sit at the bedside , and to deliver a lecture on the dangers of too much and too reckless experimentation , particularly if it was designed chiefly to show off before others . He looked down at the small face in the bed , with its big eyes . There was intelligence in the eyes , and he knew that in spite of being tipsy , Joey was comprehending . There was also sympathy in the eyes , as if they were again saying to Ish , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not like these others . " In a sudden flood of affection for his youngest son , Ish reached down and took one of the little hands in his own . He saw an answeringlook of affection come into the big eyes , and suddenly Ish knew that behind all the boyish bumptiousness , Joey was really a timid , sensitive child , just as he himself had once been . In fact , Joey 's brashness was only the expression of timidity gone too far the other way . " Joey , boy , " he said impulsively , " why do you keep straining so hard ? Weston and Walt  --  they 're two years older than you are . Why do n't you go easier ? In ten years  --  twenty years  --  you 'll be away ahead of anything they can do . " He saw the boy smile slightly , happily . But Ish knew that the happiness was merely that a new-found sympathy with his father , not at an impression that the words might have made . Any child , even a precocious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk of ten years away was merely , for a child , to talk of centuries . Ish looked at the little face again , and he saw the eyes roll slightly outward with drunkenness and sleepiness , and there was incongruity in the two . Yet Ish felt this love for his son welling up more strongly than ever within him . " This one , this one , " he thought , " is the Child of the Blessing ! This one will carry on ! " He saw the eyes lose focus , and the eyelids drop shut , and so he spoke no more , but he sat there by the bed , holding the hand in his own . Then , perhaps because sleep is so like death , a horriblefear swept in upon him . " Hostages to fortune ! " he thought . When a man loved greatly , he laid himself open . He himself had had good luck . He had loved greatly with Em , and now , again perhaps , with Joey . With Em he had had the luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of death . She was the stronger . With Joey it was different . Holding the hand , he could feel the faint throb of the pulse in the wrist , and it seemed very close to the surface . A mere scratch would be enough . What were the chances for a little boy , not strong of body , driven on always by too powerful a mind ? Yet , this might be the one who could shape the whole future . He had only to grow in stature and in mind , to gain wisdom with the years , and to live . Between the plan and the fulfillment lies always the hazard . Heart-beat flutters , knife flashes , horse stumbles , cancer grows , more subtle foes invade ... . Then they sit around the fire at the cave-mouth , and say , " What shall we do ? Now that he is no longer here to lead us ! " Or , while the great bell tolls , they gather in the courtyard , and say , " It should not have happened so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Or they meet at the street corner , and say sadly , " Why did it have to be this way ? Now there is no one to take his place . " Through all of history it runs as a plaint . " If the young king had not fallen ill . . . . If the prince had lived . . . . If the generalhad not so recklessly exposed himself . . . . If the president had not overworked .... " Between the plan and the fulfillment stands always the frail barrier of a human life . Once more the fogs thinned out , and then came the first hot days . " I have seen it again , " Ish thought to himself . " The great pageant of the year ! Now is the time of dryness and death . Now the god lies dying ! Soon the rains will come , and then the hills will be green . At last one morning I shall look out westward , here from the porch , and I shall see the sun setting far to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I shall carve the number into the rock . What shall we call this year , I wonder ! " By now also it was time to be expecting Dick and Bob to return from their expedition in the jeep . Ish still worried and felt guilty sometimes at having allowed the boys to go , but now they hadP249been gone so long that he was somewhat accustomed to the idea and did not feel the strain so much as had earlier . And at the same time he had another worry and sells of guilt that tended to counteract this one . The children ! Their superstition and their id ) is about religion ! He had said to himself that all this would be easy to counteract ; he had said that he would do something that next clay . Yet all summer he had been flinching . Was it actually that he did not want to do anything ? Did he really want the children to think of Joey as the possessor of some special power ? Deep within himself , did he want the children to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not every day or every year could a man have reason to play with the intoxicating idea that he was becoming a god . Oh , well  --  say , at least a demi-god , a being of some degree of special power ! Ever since the incident of the hammer , he had been studying curiously the children 's attitude toward him . It was changeable and uncertain . Sometimes , he sensed that feeling of awe which he had seen on that day of the incident with the hammer . He , like Joey , but even more so , had mama within him . He could performstrange feats . He knew the meanings of the puzzling words . He knew the curious ways of numbers . He knew , by some strange power , what the world was like , away beyond the horizon , out through the Golden Gate , that there were islands far in the ocean beyond the little rock-tips of the Farallones , that they sometimes saw standing up above the horizon on clear days . The children , he came to realize , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inexperienced as children in the Old Times had rarely been . None of them had ever seen more than a few dozen people . Though their lives , he believed , had been happy , they had been happy with the simplicity of a few satisfying experiences , repeated again and again . They had not suffered the continual shock of change which had so affected children in the old days , both for good and for bad , making them nervous on the one hand , and yet alert on the other . Children so unsophisticated might easily come to feel a certain dread of him , to regard him as a being with powers different fromP250their own , not altogether earthly . At times he sensed this feeling and even saw definite evidences of it . Yet at other times , indeed generally , he was merely their own father or grandfather , or Uncle Ish , a person they had known all their lives , with whom they had romped on the floor when they were little . They had no more respect for such a person than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed the adolescent feeling that the older man was blundering and quite obtuse . Perhaps they stood in some awe , but still they played tricks on him . Once , not a week after the incident of the hammer , they had set a tack for him in his chair , though that was one of the oldest of all tricks to play on a teacher . And again , after they had left the room with much suppressed giggling , Ish discovered that someone had worked that other old trick of pinning a strip of cloth to his rear , so that it hung down like a white tail behind . Ish accepted such tricks in good spirit , and did not attempt to find out which one of the children had done them or to inflict any punishment . In some ways the tricks pleased him , for they showed him that children considered him one of themselves . But the tricks also chagrined him a little . His ego was not above being pleased with the belief that he was a folk-hero or demi-god . Was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his chair or pinning a tail on him , behind ? Yet , as he thought farther , he realized that the two attitudes were not incompatible or altogether unprecedented . That is a strange thing  --  to be a god ! They bring the fat ox with the gilded horns , and at your altar they strike him down with the pole-ax . You are proud of the sacrifice . But then they take head and horns and tail and hide , and in the hide they wrap the entrails . All this noisomeness they burn before your altar , and then go to feast themselves on the fat haunches ! You see the deceit , and you are angry with a god 's anger . You gather the thunderbolts , and your black clouds assemble . But , no , you think then , " They are my people ! " This year they are fat and proud and insolent  --  but who would wish his people to be mean and meeching ? NextP251year , if there is pestilence , they will really burn the ox  --  nay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with only a little thunder , scarcely noticedin the pleasant confusion of the feasting . " I am not stupid , " you say to The Son , " but there are times when a god should seem stupid ! " Then you wonder if you should have shared with him any secret of godship , but rather have looked for a convenient mountain to pile upon him . He is altogether too handy with a sickle these days ... . Even you terrible ones who call for human sacrifice , you too must wink ! Ah , it is magnificently horrible ! The shrieks of his wife and the moans of the victim and the flailing axes of the killers ! There he lies , covered with blood , his tongue hanging out , a picture of loathsome death ! Yet soon , in the confusion of the dance , he rises suddenly and dances with the others and the red mulberry juice mingles with his sweat and disappears . Then you , the terrible one , must be a wise god and remember only the horrorof the seeming death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricked ... . " No , there is no need to grovel and rub the face in the dirt . Merely bow the head , as you enter , ever so slightly . " Yet in the end , though he half feared the test , Ish could not resist an experiment . Perhaps the incident of the hammer had really meant nothing . He was curious . He picked the time carefully  --  late one morning , when it was only a few minutes before dismissal . He was preparing himself a retreat , if things got too embarrassing . There was no difficulty , since he was the teacher , in bringing a discussion around to the point where he could put the question casually enough . " How was it , do you think , that all these things . . . " he gesturedwidely with his hands , " how was it that the world happened to be made ? " The answer came quickly . Weston was the spokesman , although apparently any of the children could have answered : " Why , the Americans made everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he saw how the idea had arisen . After all , if a child asked who made the houses orP252the streets or the canned food , any of the older ones would have said naturally that the Americans did . He followed up with another question . " And the Americans  --  what about them ? " " Oh , the Americans were the old people . " This time Ish found it a little harder to adjust quickly . In " the old people " he sensed not merely a reference to time , but also something close to superstition . " The old people "  --  that had once meant fairies , people of the Other-world . That might be its meaningnow again . Here was something he should work to counteract . " I was . . . " He began simply . Then he paused and corrected himself , seeing no reason to use the past tense . " I am an American . " When he spoke , though they were the simplest of words , he had a curious feeling of pride come over him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had been a great thing , in those Old Times , to be an American . You had been deeply conscious of being one of a great nation . It was no mere matter of pride , but also there went with it a profound sense of confidence and security in life , and a comradeship of millions . Yet now he had hesitated to speak in the present tense . In the silence of his pause he saw the children looking at him , and then suddenly he sensed that his explanation had missed fire . He had merely been trying to explain that there was nothing supernatural in those old people who had been the Americans . He had tried merely to say , " Look at me , I 'm Ish , father of some of you , granddad of one . I 've rolled on the floor with you . You 've mussed my hair . Yes , I 'm only Ish . And now when I say , I 'm an American ' , I mean that there is nothing supernatural about Americans . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had thought they would understand , but it had gone the other way round . When he had said , " I am an American , " they had nodded inwardly , interpreting , " Yes , naturally , you are an American . You have many strange knowledges which we simple ones do not have . You teach us reading and writing . You tell tales about the world being round . You talk about numbers . You carry the hammer . Yes , it is plain that peopleP253like you made all the world , and you are merely one who lingers over from the Old Times . You are one of the Old People . Yes , naturally you are an American ! " As he looked about , almost wildly at this new thought , the silence was deep , and he saw Joey smiling at him . It was a knowingsmile , as if Joey were saying , " We two have something in common . I am like one of the Old People who has been left over . I can read ; I understand those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ish was glad that he had had the foresight to ask his question just before noon . There was nothing he could muster now , either for question or reply . " School dismissed , " he said . " School dismissed ! " P254One late afternoon Ish was talking with Joey , or actually they were continuing Joey 's education by means of playschool . Ish had collected some money , and was teaching Joey a little about history and the old economics . Joey liked the bright jingly nickels with the figure of the strange humped animal . As a young child would have done even in the Old Times , he preferredthe nickels to the uninteresting bills with their picture of a bearded man who looked something like Uncle George . Ish was trying to find ways to explain . Just as he thought he had put the point across , he heard a strange and yet old and familiar sound . He lifted his head and waited tensely , mouth open to listen . It came again , much closer  --  the toot-a-toot-toot of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They 're back ! " He jumped up , letting the bills scatter from his hand to the floor . He and Em and the children all came rushing out , and there was a universal running and yapping of dogs , just as the jeep came P255clown the road . It was dirty and travel-worn and banged-about , but it had got through . Ish had still a moment of tension . Then the boys jumped out , yelling loudly , obviously alive and well . A sudden sense of profound relief let him know how much he had really been worrying about them . The boys stood there , surrounded by a little mob of yelling children . Ish held back , almost diffident . Then his eyes caught another movement . There must be someone else in the jeep . Yes , now the person was starting to get out . Ish had a sharp sensation of alarm , of resentment , at the intruder . First , as the head was thrust out from the low door , Ish saw a bald crown and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been stained with tobacco and dirty-looking , and scraggly around the edges where it had been haggled with scissors . The man stepped out , and slowly straightened up . Ish , almost in panic , appraised him . A big fellow  --  tall and largeframedand heavy ! He was powerful , and yet there had been little vigor in his movement as he straightened up . Yes , powerful , but with some inner trouble , and too heavy ! The pudgy fat of the thick-featured face had squeezed in upon the eyes , narrowing them . " Pig-eyes ! " thought Ish , still in resentment . The children were milling around , and the man stood in their midst , just as he had stepped down from the car . He looked up , and saw Ish , and their glances met . The man 's little fat-encroachedeyes were bright blue . He smiled at Ish . Ish smiled back , though he raised the corners of his mouth only by conscious effort . " Should have smiled first , " he was thinking . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done it with him . He 's powerful , even though his fat looks soft and unhealthy . " Ish broke up the situation by striding forward to grasp Bob 's hand . But even as he did so , the newcomer was still in his mind  --  " About my age , " he was thinking . Now Bob was making the introduction . " This is our friend Charlie ! " he said simply , and he slapped Charlie on the back . " Glad to see you ! " Ish managed to say , but even the old mean-P256ingless words did not slide out naturally . He looked straight at thenarrow blue eyes , and in the tenseness of his look there was perhaps a conscious defiance . No , those others were not pig-eyes . Boar 's eyes ! Strength and ferocity behind the baby-blue . As they shook hands , Ish felt his own grasp the weaker . The other could have squeezed and hurt him if he had wished . Now Bob had taken Charlie away , to introduce him to the others . Ish felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he thought . But he had imagined the return as a reunion with no discordant elements . And here was Charlie ! Handsome , no doubt  --  in a way ! A good companion  --  so the actions of the boys seemed to testify ! But  --  yes  --  Charlie was dirty . That thought gave a background of rationality to the unreasoning dislike . Charlie was dirty , and from inner reaction Ish felt himself going on to think that Charlie must be in some way dirty inside , through and through , as well as outside . Dirt  --  the ever-present dirt of the earth  --  that was something which bothered Ish no more than it bothered anyone else these days . But the impression of dirt that Ish gained from Charlie was something different . Perhaps , he analyzed quickly , it was the clothes . Charlie was wearing what had in late years become a rarity , a business suit . He was even wearing the vest , because the afternoon was cold with low-drifting clouds . But the suit seemed greasy , and you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been possibility of a man 's having had eggs to eat recently . They all went trooping up to the house suddenly , Ish with them , not leading . The living-room was jammed . The two boys , and Charlie , held the center . The children looked marveling at the boys , as explorers returned from a far expedition , and they eyed Charlie with as much wonder , because they were unused to seeing any stranger . It was one of the biggest occasions that anyonecould well imagine . Ish thought to himself it was a time to open champagne , if he had any ice . Then he wondered why the idea seemed ironic . " Did you make it ? " everyone was asking at once . " How far did you get ? What about that big city  --  what 's its name ? " P257Yet in the midst of all the excitement , Ish felt himself sliding sidelong looks at the greasy beard and spotted vest , and gradually resenting Charlie more than ever . " Watch your step , " he thought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resenting the intrusion of anyone else who may have different manners and ideas . You keep saying that the communityneeds the stimulation of new thoughts , and yet when someone else comes in , you start resenting him , and rationalizing to yourself , because you say , He 's dirty on the outside , and so must have something dirty about him on the inside . ' Relax  --  this is a great day ! " Nevertheless , all thought of its being a great day went sour inside him . " No , " Bob was saying , " we never got to New York . We got to that other big city  --  Chicago . But past there the roads kept getting worse and worse  --  trees grown up , trees fallen around everywhere , lots of washouts , bridges gone . So we had to shift one way or the other , looking for ... " Someone cut in with another question before Bob could even finish his answer . There were half a dozen questions , each one canceling out the one before . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance he seemed momentarily to sense clanger , and he knew that Ezra too was watching Charlie . Ish felt himself both reassured and justified . Ezra knew people , Ezra liked people . If Ezra was so quickly perturbed at Charlie , there must be something about which to be wary . Ish trusted Ezra in such a case much better than he trusted himself . " Come on , " he thought again . " You do n't really know at all what Ezra 's thinking . Maybe he 's disturbed because he senses what you 're thinking . And what 's that ? Maybe I 'm only thrown off because I 'm like any small tribesman , and fear the horrible stranger with his new ideas and his new gods to fight against mine . " He brought himself back to what was being said . " . . . wear funny clothes , " he heard Dick 's voice saying , " Long white gowns , sort of , I do n't know what you call them , and they have long white sleeves in them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw stones at us . They yelled , Unclean ! unclean ! ' Theyp258kept crying , We are the people of God ! ' They made us keep away . " Then Em spoke . The rich roll of her voice , deep but feminine , seemed to cut in beneath the high-pitched almost yelping noises of the excited little crowd . Any of the others would have had to pound on the table and shout for attention . For her , the room grew quickly quiet , even though she did not raise her voice and the words were commonplace : " It 's late , " she was saying . " Time for dinner . The boys are hungry . . . Half-witted Evie gave one last little senseless giggle , and then she too was quiet . Em was saying that everyone should go home now , and come back later . Ish watched Charlie , and saw that Ezra was still watching him too . Charlie 's eyes looked at Em , perhaps a moment too long . His glance shifted to Evie 's blond hair , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look . Then everyone was getting up , starting to go . Dick took Charlie off to dinner at Ezra 's . After dinner had been got on the table and they were seated , there were a great many questions to ask . Ish let Em do most of the talking with Bob . She had all the mother 's worries to settle . Had they been sick ? Found plenty to eat ? Slept warm ? Discussion of the trip itself was being reserved until the others returned after dinner , and Ish felt also that he should not pump Bob about Charlie . Yet he could not resist the temptation entirely , and Bob showed no reticence . " Oh , " he said , " Charlie ? Sure , we just picked him up about ten days ago , down near Los Angeles . There are quite a few people , I guess , living around Los Angeles . There are some all together , like us , and a few just scattered . Charlie was by himself . " " Did you ask him to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ish watched , carefully . He saw that Bob was surprised by the question , but apparently not disturbed . " Oh , I do n't just remember . I do n't know that I asked him . Maybe Dick did . "  |p259Ish  dived into his thoughts again . Perhaps Charlie had reasons for wanting to get from Los Angeles to some other place . No , that was merely slandering a man out of prejudice without trial , and then he heard Bob going on . " He tells lots of funny stories , Charlie does . He 's a very good guy . " Funny stories , yes , and one could imagine what kind . They were frank enough in all their language , these days ; the concept of obscenity , you might say , had disappeared , largely because there was only one word for things in their vocabulary , at least among the younger ones . Obscenity seemed to have died a natural death , possibly as a counterpart to the death of romantic love . But Charlie  --  he might still be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been a prude about stories , still he felt his original resentment shifting to a kind of righteous indignation , in spite of his continually telling himself that he really knew nothing about Charlie , except the boys ' opinions that he was a very fine person . Ish felt himself wishing that the water had never gone off , and shocked them into doing something about the future , and thus bringing an outsider in among them . After dinner , they all built up a big bonfire on the hillside , and gathered about it . There was much singing and sky-larking of the youngsters . It was a time of celebration . There was much excitement , but the boys gradually got their story told . . . . They had encountered only a few minor washoutsand landslides on the highway to Los Angeles , nothing that the jeep could not negotiate in four-wheel drive . The group of religious fanatics , wearing white nightgowns and calling themselvesthe People of God , lived in Los Angeles . They had focused upon religion , Ish assumed , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive , just as in The Tribe for lack of such a leader , they had developed almost no interest in such things . Out of Los Angeles , the boys had taken 66 eastward , just as Ish remembered so vividly he had clone in the days following the Great Disaster , when he had not been much older than the boys were now . The highway across the desert was easy and open , except for an occasional stretch where sand had blown across . Theyp26ohad gone along with no more trouble than blowouts here and there . The Colorado River bridge they had found shaky , but still passable . The next community was apparently at one of the old Indian pueblos near Albuquerque . From what he could make out from the boys ' description , Ish concluded that most of the few dozen people at this little community were not very dark in complexion , but that the dominant spirit must be Indian , because their pattern of life was based on growing corn and beans as the Pueblo Indianshad done for many hundreds of years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community also had drawn inwardupon itself , and looked with suspicion upon the strangers . The people there had horses . They did not drive automobiles , and they rarely went into any town . From there , the boys had swung north to Denver , and then out eastward across the plains . " We followed a road , " said Bob . " It 's like 66 , only just part of was trying to describe Highway 6 . Some of the markers would still be standing along it , and Bob had sensed that they were the same shape as the numerals on 66 , although there was only one of them . Ish was embarrassed that his own son was not sure of the numerals . Highway 6 had led them on through the corner of Colorado , and across the plains of Nebraska . " Lots of cattle everywhere ! " Here Dick was taking up the story . " Cattle everywhere , you always see cattle . " " Did you ever see the big brown ones with humps on their shoulders ? " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , " said Dick . " How about the grass ? Does any of it grow straight and stiff looking , with a head on the end , and little grains forming . When you went through they should have been still soft and milky , perhaps . When you came back , you might have seen it somewhere standing all golden , with the grain hard . We called it wheat ' . " " No . We saw nothing like that . "   " And how about corn ? You know what that is . They were growing it there by the Rio Grande . " " No , there is no corn growing wild anywhere . " Onward still they had gone , finding the roads now blocked more often , since they had come to the wetter country with ranker and faster growth and heavier rains , combined with hard frosts in winter . The highways were splitting up into great chunks and blocks as the frost worked under them , wherever the surface was cracked , grass and weeds , and even bushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet they had crossed what was once Iowa . " We came to the big river , " said Bob . " It is the biggest of all , but the bridge was good . " They had come to Chicago , but it was a mere desert of empty streets . It would be an inhospitable place , thought Ish , when the winter winds swept in from Lake Michigan . He was not surprised that people , with the whole continent to choose from , had drifted away from the once great city by the lake , leaving it ghost-like be-hind , Leaving Chicago , the boys had lost themselves in the maze of roads in the outskirts , and had ended up ( the day was cloudy , and they lost direction ) by going south instead of east . " After that , " said Bob , " we got one of these things out of a store . It points direction  --  " And he looked at Ish for the word . " Yes , a compass , " said Ish . " We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got going east again , until we came to the river we could n't cross . " Ish figured out quickly that it might have been the Wabash . Floods of twenty-two years , or  --  more likely  --  just one great flood , had swept away the bridges . After exploring southward and findingno passage , the boys had had to go northward to Highway 6 again , which more or less followed a height of land . The progress eastward had become more and more laborious . Floods , windstorms , and frost had transformed the once open and smooth highways into rough lines of concrete chunks strewn with gravel from washouts , overgrown with vegetation , and crisscrossed with fallen tree-trunks . Sometimes the jeep could push throughP262the bushes or detour the tree-trunks . But often the boys had had to make a passage-way with ax or shovel , and the constant work wore them down . Also the loneliness began to oppress them . " There was a cold day with a north wind , " Dick confessed , " and we were afraid . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we thought we might never get home . " Somewhere , probably near Toledo , they had turned back . At turning back , a kind of panic came upon them . At the same time ! heavy rains began to fall , and the roads were often flooded . They had the fear that some of the bridges over the larger rivers might be carried away , leaving them cut off from their own people . They had not tried to go south , as Ish had wished , but had backtrackedalong their own trail , gradually being reassured by their ability to get back to places that they had seen already . On their return home , therefore , they had learned little that they had not learned on the way east . Ish did not blame them at all . In fact , he thought that they had acted with great determination and intelligence . He blamed himself , if anyone  --  for sending the boys toward Chicago and New York , the great cities of the Old Times . He might have done better to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of a route into the inhospitable country of northern winters . And yet , east of Houston at least , floods would have been more severe and growth of vegetation much more rapid than farther north . Because of climate , Arkansas and Louisiana would have reverted to impassable wilderness much sooner than Iowa and Illinois . The children were dancing and shouting around the bonfire . ' Was there a kind of wild primitiveness in the scene , or was that merely his imagining ? Perhaps any children would have done the same . Evie , who of course was mentally a child , was dancing with them . Her blond hair streamed spectacularly behind her . Ish sat , looking on , and thinking . Well , the chief result of the expedition was not the discovery that the country was returning to the wilderness . Anybody would have known that ! The important thing was the making of contact with two other communities . That is , if you could call it contact , when the otherP263communities were fighting off all advances from strangers . Was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep instinct of self-preservation ? Yet , at least , to know that there were people in Los Angeles and near Albuquerque  --  going communities  --  took away a little of that basic feeling of loneliness . Two little groups of people , discovered on a single trip , going and coming by the same road ! At that rate , there should be severaldozen in the area of the whole United States . He remembered the Negroes whom he had seen in Arkansas , long ago . In that rich country of easy winters , there was no reason in the world why those three should not have survived and become a nucleus to which others , either black or white , could attach themselves . Yet that community in its ways of life and thought would be vastly different from the one in New Mexico and from either of the two in California . This divergence opened vast questions for the distant future . But this was no time to be carrying philosophical speculation far into the future . The dancing and shouting of the children around the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older boys , even some of the married ones , were joining the revel . They were playing crack-the-whip , all the more exciting becausethe one who was thrown off the end of the whip had to dodge the fire . Suddenly Ish felt himself stiffen . Charlie was playing ! In the line , linked between Dick and Evie , he was swingingthe whip . The children were obviously delighted to have a grown-up , especially this stranger , playing with them . Ish tried to argue down his resentment . Why not ? Why should n't one of the older ones play that way ? Me  --  I 'm just as bad as those people in Los Angeles and Albuquerque , not wanting to accept the stranger ! Yet I do n't think I 'd have minded , if Charlie had been a different kind of person . But , try as he could , Ish felt himself unable to stifle some deepseatedsense of dislike . He began to revise his estimate of the importance of the boys ' trip . However important the discovery of the other communities could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . P264By now it was getting late , and mothers were gathering their children . But after the celebration was over , most of the older ones went home with Ish and Em , to hear still more from the two boys and from Charlie . " Sit here , " said Ezra to Charlie , pointing to the big chair in front of the fireplace . It was a place of honor , and comfort too , and Ish thought how characteristic that was of Ezra , to sense the human relationship so quickly . He himself , though he was host , had not thought of it , and so had not been able to make Charlie feel really welcome . And then he wondered , in quick reaction , whether he really wanted to make Charlie feel at home . It was a chilly evening , and Ezra called for a fire . The boys brought some wood , and before long the sticks were blazing cheerily . The room grew comfortably warm . They talked , Ezra leading the conversation , as usual . Charlie asked if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle of brandy and a glass . He drank steadily , but with the habitual drinker 's slow absorption . He gave no sign of either excitement or drunkenness . " I 'm still chilly , " said Ezra . " You 're not getting sick , are you ? " said Em . Ish himself felt a little chill of uneasiness . Sickness was so uncommonwith them that any occurrence of it was a matter of note . " Do n't know , " said Ezra . " If this was the Old Times , I 'd think I was getting a cold . Of course , it ca n't be that now . " They piled more wood on the fire , and the room grew so uncomfortableto Ish that he took off his sweater and sat in his shirt sleeves . Then Charlie took off his coat also , and unbuttoned his vest , but did not take it off . George comfortably settled down into his end of the davenport , and went to sleep . His absence did not make much difference in the conversation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but still it made no difference in him except that from the heat of the fire and from the brandy , his forehead was greasy with perspiration . Ish could tell now that Ezra was swinging the conversation around , this way and that , to get more information about Charlie'sP265background . But finesse seemed not to be required , for Charlie talked frankly enough whenever the subject came close to him . " So , after she croaked  --  " he said . " That was after we 'd lived together for quite a few years , ten or twelve , I guess . Well , after my woman died , I did n't want to stay there no more , not around that place . So , when your boys came along , and I liked them , I picked up and came . " As Charlie talked , Ish began to feel himself swinging in the other direction again . The boys liked Charlie immensely , and they had been with him for some time already . There was strength in Charlie , and charm also . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community . He noticed now that whole beads of sweat were standing out on Charlie 's forehead . " Charlie , " he said , " you 'd better take that vest off and be comfortable . " Charlie started , but did not say anything . . " I 'm sorry , " Ezra said . " I do n't know what 's wrong with me . Maybe I 'd better go home , get to bed . " But he made no move to go . " Surely you ca n't be getting a cold , Ez , " said Em . " There 's never been a cold ! " They persuaded Charlie to move , himself and his brandy bottle , to a place farther from the fire , but he kept his vest on . Charlie sat there , and the two house-dogs came nuzzling around him . Obviously , even the dogs were interested in the stranger ; he must mean a lot of new smells . But they sensed that the stranger had been received . Although at first they were merely neutral , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears and scratching of their backs . Their tails wagged . Ish , always realizing that people were likely to baffle him , felt himself swing back and forth . Now he sensed both power and charm in Charlie , and felt almost warm toward him . And then the very sense of power and charm caused him to react , perhaps with fear for his own position as a dominant force in the community , and he felt Charlie only as a thing of evil . At last George woke from his nap , stretched his big body and rose , saying that it was time for him to get home to bed . The others made ready to go with him . Ish knew that Ezra wouldP266want to say a word to him personally before going , and so he drew Ezra aside into the kitchen . " You feeling bad ? " " Me ? No , " said Ezra . " Never felt better in my life . " Ezra smiled , and Ish began to see light . " You were n't chilly ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Ezra . " Just wanted to see if we could make Charlie take his vest off . I did n't think we could . He do n't like to be away from it . Makes me pretty sure about what I think I see anyway . He 's got a vest-pocket he 's deepened himself , enlarged it . He 's got in it one of those little things they used to make for ladies to carry around in their purses  --  just aIsh had a sudden sense of relief . Anything as simple and concreteas a pistol  --  that could be handled ! His relief faded as Ezra went on : " I wish I was sure about him . Sometimes I think there 's somethingugly and dirty and mean  --  clear to the middle of him . SometimesI think he 'll be my best friend . Always , though , I know he 's one that knows what he wants and generally gets it . " When they went back to the living-room , George was just leaving . " This is the best thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was saying to Charlie . " We 've needed another strong man . We hope you stay with us . " There was a general confirmatory chorus from the others , as all of them , Charlie and Ezra included , went out the door . Ish was left standing with his thoughts . He had tried to join in the chorus , but his tongue had been suddenly stiff and his mouth dry . All he could think now was : " Something dirty and ugly and mean  --  clear to the middle of him . " small piece of hardware ! "  |p267After  they had gone , Ish thought of something that he had not done during all these years . In fact , after he had decided to do it , he was not sure whether he still could . Yet , when he went into the kitchen , he found that there was a bolt on the back door . He could remember his mother having had it put there because she never trusted the ordinary locks . He shot that bolt . Then he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a workable night-latch . In all these years , there had been no need to secure a door . No one in the community was to be feared ; no stranger , if there had been one , would have had a chance of getting through the cordon of dogs . But now there was someone , perhaps not to be trusted , and he had made friends with the dogs . Had that patting of the dogs had calculation behind it ? When Ish had gone to bed and shared his apprehensions with Em , he found her not very responsive . Sometimes , he realized , she was too all-accepting for him.  | " What 's so remarkable about him carrying a gun ? " she said . " You carry one yourself , lots of the time , do n't you ? " " Not concealed ! And I 'm not afraid to take my vest off , and be away from my weapon . " " Yes , but maybe you should give him a break for being nervous and uncomfortable , too . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours . He 's among strangers  --  surrounded ! " Ish felt a surge of resentment , almost anger , against Charlie , the intruder . " Yes , " he said , " but we are on the ground here ; this is our place ; he comes breaking in ; he must adapt himself to us ; not we to him . " " You 're right , darling , I guess . But anyway , let 's do n't talk about it any more now . I 'm going to sleep . " If there was any one thing that Ish had always envied in Em , it was her capacity to go to sleep merely by saying so . As for him , the harder he thought about going to sleep , the longer he was likely to take , and he could never slow down his mind as he wanted to . Now again he felt it settle to work . For suddenly he had had a new idea , and a disturbing one . The trouble was , he decided , that he had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle . If The Tribe had been really drawn together already into some firm organization , if there were some symbolic unity by which they presented an unbroken front , then the mere advent of any stranger , strong though he might be as an individual , would be of little moment . Now it might be too late . The stranger had come already , and he must be met as man to man . And Charlie would be no mean opponent . Already he had won the loyalty and friendship of Dick and Bob , and doubtless of others of the younger ones . George was obviously impressed . Ezra seemed doubtful . What was this strange charm , backed by strength ? Ish could not sense why anyone felt a liking for Charlie , but the fact was that they did . And the fact might be also that he himself was too narrowly prejudiced against the man , out of a spirit of rivalry , to feel Charlie 's real strength . But of one thing he began to feel certain . There would be some contest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take , he could not yet know . But since they lacked the solidarity of anything that could be called a state , the contest would be an individual one . Or at worst , it would be a struggle of factions with two opposingleaders . On whom could he , Ish , depend ? He was not really a leader . He had been a leader so far , doubtless , by default  --  because George had been too stupid and Ezra too easygoing to offer any competition . Oh , intellectual leadership , yes ! But in any basic struggle for power , the intellectual man went under . He thought of the deceptively pretty eyes of baby-blue ; yet they had a coldness such as dark eyes could never show . " Who will follow my banner ? " he questioned dramatically . Even Em seemed to be failing him . She had made light of things , almost defended Charlie . All at once Ish felt himself the scared little boy of the Old Times . Of all these people Joey alone was the one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could always count . And Joey was a little boy , physically frail even for his years . What help could he be against the rush of Charlie 's power ? No , not pig-eyes , he thought again . They are a boar 's eyes ! Finally , however , he said to himself , " This is the mere madness of midnight ; these are only the wild fantasies that come to a man in the darkness when he can not sleep . " And he managed , at last , to dismiss the thoughts from his mind , and to sleep . In the morning things indeed looked better  --  not altogether rosy , perhaps , but at least not too dark . He ate breakfast in a good enough mood . He was happy to see Bob at the breakfast table again , and by questioning got from him some more details of the trip . Then , just as he was beginning to feel comfortable , the whole thing broke loose on him when Bob spoke . " I guess , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ish felt a sudden desire to snap out a bit of fatherly advice , " I would n't see so much of that fellow , if I were you . " But he saw Em 's eyes saying no , and he himself knew that such advice would only make Charlie seem forbidden and more attractive . He stillP270kept wondering what fascination Charlie exercised upon the two boys . Bob went , and after the morning chores were finished , the other children drifted off too . " What is the fascination ? " said Ish to Em . " Oh , do n't worry , " she said . " It 's just the attraction of a stranger , something new . Is n't that natural ? " " There is trouble ahead ! " " Perhaps , " said Em , and Ish suddenly realized that that was the first time she had admitted the possibility , and then she changed the direction of his thoughts with a second remark , " But be careful that you 're not the one who starts the trouble . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although he did not often get angry at Em . " You mean that this is just a fight for domination ? " " I think that you 'd better go over and see what 's happening now , " she said , disregarding his last question . The advice seemed good in any case , for perhaps he too was curious . He started to follow it , and just as he was opening the front door , he had a feeling of uncertainty . He closed the door behind him , and stood on the front porch wondering . His hands felt strangely empty ; he needed something . He felt defenseless , and he considered going back into the house to strap a pistol on . In the vicinity of the houses they never needed to carry firearms any more , because the dogs gave plentiful warning ; but he could make an excuse that he was going somewhere farther off . Still , he hesitated , realizing that to carry a pistol would look like aggression  --  besides , it would be a confession of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of uncertainty . He went back into the house , and immediately saw the hammeron the mantelpiece . " So that 's it ! " he thought irritably . " You 're as bad as the children . You 're letting the children 's ideas work into you ! " Nevertheless he picked up the hammer and took it along . Its weight and solidity gave him comfort . The handle 's firm hardness filled up the emptiness of his right hand . Over from where the bonfire had been , he heard a sound ofP271people laughing , and he walked that way . He was alone , and then suddenly he felt again the Great Loneliness . It came upon him with paralyzing force . Once more he was the ant lost from the hill , the bee from the destroyed hive , the motherless child ! He paused and stood still , feeling the cold sweat start . No , the United States of America was only a name far in the past ! He must act by himself , or with what support he himself could rally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney or judge , anywhere , to whom he could look . He was gripping the hammer-handle so hard that his knuckles hurt . " I ca n't go back ! " he thought . Then he mustered all his courage , and slid one foot forward in front of the other . Once he was moving again , once action had succeeded thought , he felt better . He saw them now , ahead , as he had expected , at the ashes of the bonfire . Almost all the younger ones were there , and Ezra with them . They stood and sat and lounged around Charlie , and he was telling them things , laughing and joking as he went along . All this was just about what Ish had expected , and only when he had looked more closely did a sudden feeling of coldness seem to begin at his stomach and then flow out until it came clear to the ends of his fingers and toes . His right hand had gripped harder , vise-like , on the hammer-handle . Close to the center of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the half-witted one , and there was a look on her face that Ish had never seen there before . Ish was about ten paces from Charlie when he noticed . He halted . Some of the children had seen him , but they were interested in the story , and no one had paid him any attention . He stood there , as if not yet officially present . He paused . It seemed a long time . But he could feel his heart throbbing , and it did not pound more than a few times . He felt the coldness ooze away . Now he was ready for action . He was almost happy . The problem had suddenly taken form , and even the worst problem in definite form was better than a fog lurking in corners . You could not combat a mere suggestion of evil . Still , through the long period of a few more heart-beats , heP272stood there . The problem had revealed itself and taken shape suddenly . That too was part of their present way of life . In the Old Days a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks and months before the strike broke or the bombs fell . When you were dealing with only a few people , a crisis came quickly . He looked . Evie was at the center of the group , and usually you could count upon her being somewhere on the outskirts . Usually she paid only furtive attention to what was happening ; now she kept her face directed at Charlie 's , seeming to drink his words in , although she certainly did not understand much of what he was saying . There was something more there than the desire to understand his words . They were sitting close together . Was it for this , Ish thought with bitterness , that they had cared for Evie . Ezra had found her  --  dirty , groveling , and unkempt , living in filth with merely enough intelligence to open cans to feed herself on whatever they contained , without cooking or preparation . It would have been better , he had often thought , if they had merely put a can of sweet ant-poison within her reach somewhere . As it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , and she had certainly been no pleasure to them and probably no pleasure to herself . Their caring for her had been , he thought sometimes , merely a curious lingering of an old standard of humanitarianism . Now he looked again at the group before him , and in Evie he noticed something that had never been so apparent to him before . That was the trouble of too long familiarity ; just as a picture on the wall became something you did not notice at all , so a person whom you knew for many years tended to lose individual characteristics . Evie , he realized now , was a fully developed woman , startlingly blond , in a special way , beautiful . You had to forget , of course , the strangeness of her eyes , and a vacancy in her face . And that was something which he , Ish , could never really do . But to a man like Charlie , such matters were not important . Yes , as Ezra had said , Charlie knew what he wanted , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any reason why he should delay ? P273Ish gripped hard on the hammer-handle . He took comfort from it , but he had become very conscious that it was not a pistol . A sudden burst of laughter came at something which Charlie was saying . Looking at Evie again , Ish saw that she too was laughingin a high , uncontrolled giggle ; as she laughed , Charlie reached across and pinched her in the ribs . She screamed girlishly , high and shrill . Then as Ish drew near , his presence all at once seemed to become official , and everyone turned to look at him . Instantly , Ish realized that they had been waiting for him , that the new situation had disturbed them all , and that they were looking for some suggestion of what to do . He walked forward steadily toward Charlie , still gripping hard with his right hand , but taking care not to clench his left fist , in spite of his rising anger . As Ish drew near , Charlie  --  nonchalantly almost  --  reached out with his right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to him . She seemed surprised , but yielded comfortably . Charlie looked at Ish , and Ish knew that this was the crisis of open defiance . Ish mutely accepted the challenge ; he felt calmer now . This was no time to let anger disturb one 's thoughts . Now that there was action , he could think more clearly . " All of you go somewhere for a while ! " he said loudly . There was no need for finesse or excuses ; they all knew something was going to happen . " I want to talk to Charlie here alone for a few minutes . Ezra , you take Evie over to Molly 's . She needs her hair combed . " There was no argument ; everybody left so readily that they must really have been a little frightened . By having Ezra go , Ish was losing his best ally , but to have had him stay would have been a confession of weakness before all of the others , including Charlie . Then the two of them were left there alone  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Charlie , still sitting . Charlie made no gesture of rising ; so Ish too sat down . He would not stand when the other sat so lazily . Charlie was still wearing his vest , although he had no coat on and had unbuttoned the vest so that it hung loosely from him . There were six feet between them as they sat on the ground and looked at each other.  |p274Ish  saw no reason to beat about the bush . " All I want to say is that you must quit this with Evie . " Charlie was equally direct . " Who says so ? " Ish considered for words . He might say " we " but that was vague . If he could have said " We , the people " that would have been better , but he knew that Charlie would think it ridiculous . He did not want to pause longer , and so he spoke . " I say so . " Charlie said nothing in return ; he sat there . He picked up a few little pebbles from the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them here and there . He could not have stated , any more clearly , his disrespect . At last Charlie spoke . " There 's lots of old wise-cracks you can say when any guy says to you I say so ' . You know what they are ; so let 's skip them . I 'm reasonable , though . Why do n't you tell me just why you want me to lay off Evie ? She your girl , maybe ? " Ish spoke quickly . " This is it , " he said . " It 's simple enough . We 're a pretty good bunch of people here , not mental giants , any of us I guess , but still nobody too downright stupid . We do n't want a lot of little half-witted brats running in on us , the sort of children Evie would have . " Only when he had stopped speaking , did he realize that by speaking at all in reply to Charlie 's question , he had made a mistake . Like any intellectual , he had been happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted that his command was non-effective . Now , in spite of himself , he felt in second place , with Charlie the leader . " Hell ! " said Charlie . " What makes you think she 's been around here all this time and not had plenty of chances to have kids with all those boys around , if she was going to have any ? " " The boys never touched Evie , " said Ish . " She was something they grew up with ; she was taboo . And besides , all the boys were married off as early as they could be . " He was still arguing , and was perhaps at the bad end of the argument.  | " So you say again ! " Charlie 's words had the confident ring of the voice of a man feeling himself in control . " What you really ought to be glad for is that I picked on that one around here , the only one old enough who ai n't married already . What if I 'd liked one of the others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty mess on your hands . You better be glad I was so agreeable . " Ish thought wildly for something to say . What more could be said ? You could not threaten with the police or say that the districtattorney might be interested . He had flung the challenge and been met head on . No , there was nothing more to say . Ish got up , turned on his heel , and walked off . He had a sudden quick memory in his mind of once long before , when he had met a man just after the Great Disaster , and had turned , and walked away with the feeling that he might be shot in the back . Yet , after that first memory , he was not afraid , and it was the more humiliating that he was not . He realized that Charlie would think there was no need of shooting . He , Ish , had come off second-best . He was in the depths of bitterness as he walked back toward his own house . He had forgotten how deep humiliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a symbol of power . For years things had gone easily , and he had been a leader . But after all he was not so different from the strange youth that he now could hardly remember . The youth who had existed in the old days before the Great Disaster ; the one who was afraid to go to dances , the one who was never quite at ease with other people , and had never been a leader . He had changed much ; he had outgrownmuch ; but he could not outgrow it all . Then as he came , deep in bitterness , through the door of the old house , Em was there waiting for him . He laid down the hammer . He took her into his arms , or perhaps she took him into hers , he was not sure . But after that he felt suddenly a new confidence . Sometimes she did not agree with him . They had argued just the night before about Charlie , but in the end he knew that he would renew his confidence from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the story . He did not wait to hear what she thought , but he felt her **28;4157;TOOLONG came over to where Brownie stood . " I would n't get mortified . It 's the same fix with everybody . " " I milked before . " " It ai n't milkin ' . I 'm talkin ' about the chips . " " I said all right , Pa . " " It 's just that it 's new that bothers you . Do it awhile and you 'll think nothing to it . " Pa put his big hand on Brownie 's shoulder . It felt warm and solid . The smile on his face was inquiring , as if trying to see through to the Brownie that lived inside . " It do n't trouble me , " Brownie said , but he did n't look at Pa . He looked at Ma , who was digging kettles out of a box . " If you mind , I 'll do it , and you can set up the tent . " Brownie shook his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gather up buffalo chips . It shamed him to do it , but it would shame him more to show his shame to Pa . He had a lead rope on Nellie . He would take her over to where the herd was grazingand pick up some chips on the way back and maybe not be seen but by a few . It was troublesome , to be ashamed of shame but to be ashamed just the same , and not just about buffalo chips , either . Here on the naked Platte there was n't a bush to stand or squat behind . People could n't build a brush arbor as they did at camp meetings . And , for fear of Indians , they could n't walk out of sight . They did the best they could . Some of the women had chamber pots inside the wagons . Some had n't and sometimes were caught sudden along the way . Or a rider would get off his horse and stand on the off side and make out to be idling or sizing up the country , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would give him away . They thought up a system , the women did , and morning , noon , and night a bunch of them would trail off a piece , and the up-standing ones would make a shield for the others while the menfolks around the wagons made out to be so busy they did n't know what was going on . Brownie took the rope and set off with Nellie . Maybe there was n't anyone , he thought , as mortified as he was , and not just when it came to himself and his business , either . It struck himp101as ugly  --  the women making their shield , the men standing behindhorses , the young ones squatting almost anywhere . When he thought about it , the feeling of goodness in him drew off . He untied the rope from Nellie and turned her with the rest and wound the rope around his waist and knotted the ends , so 's to have his arms free for gathering . The chips ripped up , pulling loose from the whitened grass beneath . There were bugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ran seeking among the stems when the roof was lifted from over their heads . He would have watched them , except that he would be seen watching . He cuffed old Rock , who made a show of himself by coming close and looking , curiousas a chicken , whenever a chip was raised . Other people were working , too , young ones , like the strawhairedBrewer girl and her two brothers , and Joe Turley and Jeff Byrd and John Shields and Harry Gorham and two or three of the Daughertys . Some of the men did n't have a family and so had to do for themselves , like old Brother Weatherby , who said people should n't complain but praise God that , anyhow , there were chips to make fires with . Brother Weatherby gathered up the chips slow and sober , maybe saying a prayer to himself while he did it . The land lay quiet . The only sound Brownie could hear , except for the ring of distance and the little commotions of camp , was the tearing sound of chips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunk , as if just letting itself peek at what was going on . Then the children got to playing , throwing chunks of manure at one another and yelling shrill until the old folks called from the wagons and told them to get busy . Brownie picked up one chip and another and another . They were thick here . Buffalo chips meant buffalo  --  and not so far away now , Dick Summers said . For two days the train had kept crossing trails from the bluffs down to the river , trails as wide as the span of two hands and worn deep as a fist and as smooth as a spade could cut . Bones lay around , too , skulls and leg bones and ribs , some of them set in circles or half-moons and splashed with paint , by the Pawnees , Dick said . He picked up more chips , looking at nobody , and after a  |p102while  had an armful and stood straight , and there was Mercy McBee not five steps away , and she had n't seen him , either , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Underneath the pile , Brownie could see the small fingers bent around . She did n't speak , or turn her eyes down , either , but the blood climbed slow in her cheeks . He could n't think of anything to say . He felt heat in his own face and knew it was red , too , but still he looked at her , seeing the dark eyes and the face framed with hair that the wind had blown wild . He had a sudden , crazy wanting to reach out and touch her as a person might touch a small , scared thing , making up to it with the gentle hand . It was as if at the touch the two of them would melt into understanding that wiped away shame , into tenderness that went without words . He said , " I reckon I got a load . " She looked down and bent a little and a crumb of the dried manure fell from under her hand and caught on her faded dress and stuck there . The words he had said beat back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw himself as if he stood outside , saw himself gawky , big-handed and big-footed , with the pale fine sprouts of new whiskers on his face , saw himself unproved and likely cowardly , lost in fool dreams . He took two steps and wrenched around and said , " I could do it for you . " Her glance came up in a quick , liquid look that he could n't understand . " I 'd be pleasured to . " " I can do it all right . " She turned without thanking him . She walked away and stopped and stooped , somehow pitiful and somehow dignified , and fingered for a cow dab . Of a sudden , while he dared to watch , he understood something about her , seeing in his mind 's eye old Hank McBee and his dirty whiskers and the thin oxen , hitched along with an old roan horse , that pulled the McBee wagon , and with the wagon Mrs. McBee and her loud brood and a coop of messy chickens . He could imagine now that a snake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rattle , and he had seen the ugly headp103rise from the grass , unseen by her , and the dirty coil of it close by her ankle , and , without thought for himself , he had leaped forward and smashed the head under his heel . He jumped and came to himself and found he was on the way to the wagon , the heel of one big foot ground into the dirt and old Rock looking queerly at him , but still he talked to her saying , " Mercy ! Mercy ! " In his dream she came to him , came tenderly , with the shimmerof tears in her eyes , and put her mouth on his and rested soft in his arms  --  and he felt the animal rising in him , eager and pushful , and was ashamed of his coarseness.  | TADLOCK STOOD at the side of his second wagon . " Martin , " he said sharply , looking underneath . " You , Martin ! " He straightened , waiting for an answer , suspecting already that something was wrong . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had Martin lain abed after the sentinels had fired their four-o'clock volley . " Martin ! " Dawn was firing the east , far down the shallow valley of the Platte , and here and there the waters of the river glowed to it , like puddles under the moon , but here the night lay dusky , licked by the little fires people had commenced to make . The smell of camp smoke , of dung or wood igniting to punk and powder struck by flint and steel , came sharp to his nostrils . " Martin ! " He could n't make out the man , but only the gray hump of him under the piece of wagon sheet that Martin used for cover or tent , depending on whether the night looked fair or stormy . Tadlock stooped and caught the corner of the sheet and pulled it , calling out again . " What 's wrong here ? " The hump moved then . It lurched and settled back and a voice came out of it . " I 'm sick . Jesus ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make you a bed in one of the wagons . " Tadlock got no answer to that . He imagined Martin thinking it over , asking himself weakly , in the manner of an indisposed woman , whether he was strong enough for the day . In sharp annoyance he said , " You were all right last night . You stood your turn at guard . " He flicked the ground with the whip he carried . Damn the luck ! Here they were at Brady 's Island , within striking distancep105of the forks of the Platte , and the road was good and buffalo were plenty and the weather fair enough , and now a man had to get sick . The suspicion came to him again , while the dawn drew on and the itch to get going grew in him , that Martin was pretending to be sicker than he was . Some people would exaggeratea mere indisposition , especially if they wanted to turn back , especially if they had listened too long to weak talk about Indians and hardships . The train never camped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the Byrds , began crying about dangers . Dangers ! They 'd hardly met a one . They had had a stampede , and Mack , like the fool Tadlock told him that he was , had shot a scrawny Indian . Later a delegation from the Kaws had called about the killing , but he as captain had handled them all right . He had outfaced the bunch and sent them packing , withoutso much as one twist of tobacco to soothe their scurvy feelings . For the rest , they had n't seen a Pawnee , a Cheyenne , or a Sioux . They 'd made all the crossings safely . And , until now , no one had been sick , barring a mild flux or a stomach-ache . " We 'll get a bed fixed . You crawl out of there . " Tadlock turned and walked part way round the circle , raising his whip when people spoke to him . His own wagons were so laden that he could n't spread a decent bed without transferring part of the contents . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the Evans fire and on impulse stopped there , nodding to Evans and his wife and Dick Summers . The Evans boy , Tadlockguessed , had gone out to help gather up the stock . " Little nippy this morning , " Evans said , hitching his shoulders . " We 've got a sick man . " " Who ? " " Martin . " " What ails him ? " Tadlock shrugged . " How sick ? " Evans asked . Tadlock shrugged again . " I 'm going to rig a bed . " Summers took the pipe from his mouth and held it in frontp106of him and blew a cloud of smoke around it . The action irritatedTadlock . It was typical of the man , as if the train had all of time to consider one case of sickness . He searched for words to describe Summers . Undisciplined . Unsystematic . Accustomed to living without purpose , like a savage . " We 'll roll out on time , " he told Summers pointedly . " We ca n't hold up for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd eaten from . " Lije , " she said , " you better have a look . " Summers ' gray eyes , appearing almost white against the backdropof dawn , slid to her in an expression of approval and regard . " Well , you can see for yourselves , " Tadlock said . " Uh-huh , " Evans answered mildly . He stood up , looming big , a close , solid shadow among the shadows that were lifting to the west . Tadlock felt for him the impatience that he might have felt for a child . A slow-going , slow-witted man , Evans was , competent but without force . Tadlock found himself wondering whether the man ever lost his temper , ever came to a decisionwithout guidance from his wife or Summers . " Come on then . " Summers knocked the heel from his pipe and got up , too . " Do n't you reckon you 'd best take some medicine , Lije ? " Mrs. Evans asked , and Evans nodded and went to the tail of his wagon and , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a box . Martin lay as before , except that now he could be seen , the hair untidy on his head , the whiskers gray and stubbled on his lank face . The three of them bent over , like three hens , Tadlock thought , at the sight of a strange bug . " What 's the matter , boss ? " Summers asked . " Come on out , Martin ! " Tadlock ordered . " We ca n't doctor you there , or get you in a wagon bed , either . " He tugged at the wagon cover . Martin opened his eyes and lay staring up at the underside of the wagon . He licked his mouth and said , " Jesus ! " " Come on ! " Tadlock saw that Martin 's face was flushed andp107his eyes feverish , but still it was in him to say , " You ca n't be that sick , man . " Summers said , " Reckon he knows better'n you . " " I 'll handle this . " While Tadlock spoke Martin moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all fours and came crawling out , stumbling on the wagon sheet that trailed with him . When he was out , he let himself go flat again . " Acts bad off , " Evans said . " He wo n't feel any worse in a wagon , " Tadlock told him . Summers knelt and helped Martin over on his back and felt his forehead . " Easy , hoss , " he said , and then , to Tadlock and Evans , " Could be camp fever . " " What 's that ? " " Camp fever . No other name to it . " Martin said , " Jesus ! " and closed his eyes , and Summers looked up and shook his head . Some of the others of the camp had started to come up , attracted by the sight of the three of them standing and the man on the ground . " What 's wrong ? " Tadlock felt them behind him , but he did n't turn or answer . He wished they would clear out . They would all have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some would want to wait and some would n't know what to do . And some would want to physic the man and some to bleed and some to blister him . The result would be an endless dillydallying , when the part of good sense was to load Martin in a wagon and start rolling . It was like Evans to answer the question . " Camp fever , " he said . A woman 's voice asked , " Is it catchin ' ? " Tadlock snapped back , " No ! " Martin opened his eyes and rolled them up from face to face as if hoping to find in one of them the answer to his trouble . Tadlock swung around . " Go and get ready . We 'll move in a few minutes . Evans , if you 'll take just a little of my load , I can make a bed . We 'll doctor him and roll . " " I do ' know , Tadlock , " Evans said . " Do n't know what ? "  | " Do ' know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain . I 'll assume the responsibility . " Behind Tadlock a dry voice spoke up that he recognized as Patch 's . " We 're all together , you know , Tadlock , including your hired hand . " " Who said we were n't ? We 'll still be all together when he 's in a wagon . " " That ai n't what Patch means , " Evans put in . Tadlock bit back the words that came to his lips . The fools ! The damn fools , acting as if this were a time and place for leisurely solicitude ! He looked at them one by one  --  Evans , Summers , Patch  --  trying to stare them down . In their eyes he read a stupid stubbornness . It came to him , slowly , that the thing had come to be an issue . A position taken , a sensible position taken , a few words said  --  and then the lines drawn ! Now , here , authority was at stake , prestige , the leadership that forced the train along . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He felt movement at his side and turned and saw Mrs. McBee , a small , ragged witch of a woman . " We got some Jew David 's Plaster , " she said . " It 's good for most anything . " He waved her away . " All right , Evans . Doctor him ! " " What I want to do , " Evans said  --  and Tadlock felt a pulse of astonishment at his tone  --  " is to see everybody 's took care of proper . We got to tend to Martin . I ai n't for joltin ' him along in a wagon . " " You want to bring up the rear , I guess ! " " I want to see Martin 's took care of , or anybody else that gets sick . " Tadlock held on to himself . " Grass is already short because of the buffalo . It 'll be a damn sight shorter if we let other companiesget ahead . " " We ai n't first anyhow , " Summers answered . " There 's some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outfits with little stock . But because they 're ahead you think we can let everybody pass ! " Summers was gnawing on his pipestem . He spoke almost idly . " Camp fever makes the bones ache bad . "  |p109Patch  said , " I 'm in favor of staying here until we know Martin'sbetter . " Tadlock heard a mutter of approval from the crowd that had grown while they stood arguing . Their eyes were all fixed on him , it seemed , fixed accusingly when all he had sought was the welfare of the company . System was the thing , a time to get up , a time to travel , a time to bed down , a set distance to make daily , each man performing his appointed duties , each answering to the call of authority . That way , they 'd get to Oregon , get there safely , speedily , ahead of the rest . But these men did n't appreciate system , organization , discipline . They did n't deserve the leadership he had given them . His temper flared up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I say we 'll roll . " They did n't move . They stood quiet , regarding him with that stupid stubbornness , until Evans said , " Do ' know as we will , Tadlock . Seems to me this is a thing for the council . " " Council ! " " Let the council decide , seein ' as we do n't agree . " " Good God ! " " Meantime , I ai n't movin ' . " Patch added , " I , either , " and again there came the mutter of approval . Tadlock would have cursed them except that it occurred to him that he could handle the council . Brewer was on it , and Mack and Fairman . They would stand by him . The train would lose the time the meeting took , which was to be regretted , but hereafter these muttonheads might not be so ready to dispute his orders . " Stay then ! " he said and laughed at them . " We 'll talk our way to Oregon . " Evans stooped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Tadlock told him . " No hurry . We 're only going as far as Oregon City . " He added , " The council will meet in an hour . " For a time he watched the self-appointed doctors while they got Martin in a good bed under a tent and talked themselves into believing calomel was the proper medicine . Not that , alone , he would n't have cared for Martin and done it just asp110well . It was just that there were too many wanting to take a hand , too many holding out for Sarsaparilla Blood Pills and Balsam of Life and emetics and calomel and bloodletting . Leaving , he debated the question of talking to Mack and Fairman before the council met . He decided not to . On this open plain a private conference was impossible . Seeing them , Patch or someone would suspect a conspiracy . He would ask McBee to serve notice of the meeting . Having asked him , he strode about the camp , confident but still sore , now and then flicking his whip at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapped off a blade . The women , he saw with approval , were making the most of this idle time . Five or six of them were at the river 's edge , washing clothes in the sandy water . A couple had washboards . The others scuffed the washing between their hands and slapped the heavier things on rocks dug out of the sand from God knew where . For the most part the men not tending to Martin just stood around talking while children ran squealingamong them . They were talking , Tadlock had no doubt , about him and about Martin and what was the thing to do . Well , he could tell them . Later , at the upper end of the camp , away from the tents and the talk , Tadlock saw Summers by himself , standing still as some old bull while he looked to the West that had molded him . Tadlock walked up to him . " I ca n't understand you , Summers , " he began . Summers half turned , his two hands clasped on his rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Countin ' huffier , is all . " " I do n't mean that , " Tadlock answered , knowing Summers knew that he did n't . " We ought to be traveling . " Summers looked at the sun , now well above the eastern horizon . " Could 've made three or four miles , I reckon , " he said , his face grave . In his eyes , though , Tadlock caught a gleam that exasperated him . " Goddam it ! This is n't a thing for fun . " " Not sayin ' it is , " Summers answered , the gleam in his eyes fading , " nor for thinkin ' miles instead of Martin . " " One man is n't a train . "  | " I did n't figure you knew that . " " What do you mean ? " " Ai n't you the whole shebang ? " " You 're the pilot , Summers . That 's all . " Tadlock spoke deliberately , wanting to irritate the man , wanting almost to bait him to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited , the butt of his whip held tight in his hand . Summers turned and looked across at the river and the island that stood wooded in it . " That there 's Brady 's Island , " he said so casually that Tadlock was unprepared for the rest . " A man named Brady got himself rubbed out . That was back in ' thirty-three . " Summers ' gaze came back to rest on Tadlock . In it , Tadlock thought , was the cool , the deadly expression of an animal waiting for a kill . Not until then had he known how dangerous the guide could be . He was n't afraid but still he felt relief when Summers lifted his rifle and moved off . Tadlock watched him go . Summers ' gait was the soft and easy gait of an Indian . His hair was beginning to hang long in back , Indian-fashion , too . Well , to hell with him , Tadlock thought , and to hell with his parting look of contempt or hostility or whatever it was ! Looks did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilot . The restlessness in him made him want to move . He stepped on westward , letting his gaze roam over the sunlit country while his mind worked . Ahead of him were wagon tracks , the tracks of the emigrants of 1844 and before . They would have had their troubles , too . No doubt there were fools aplenty in those trains , men who could n't lead but balked at being led and , by the balking , showed the need of the very thing that they resisted . Across the river he saw buffalo and tried to guess how far away they were . Here in the fine air of the Platte one underestimated . A bluff or a turn of the river that looked but an hour away might be a day or more . A crow a half mile off appeared within good rifle range . Details stood out  --  the swags and rises of the sand hills , the bars of the river and the water frothy in an eddy , the beards of the distant buffalo , even the very blades of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world at once smaller and bigger , smaller because the eye saw , bigger because it sawp112so far . Sound mixed one 's impressions , too . By night every noise was intimate and distinct ; by day the report of a rifle was a faint pop in a silence that rang the head like quinine . It was a strange and awesome world . It required decision and management . He had shown the qualities it took . He had kept the train in motion . He 'd managed . They owed a debt to him  --  and paid in criticism ! Take the day Mack shot the Indian , the day that followed the stampede . When daylight came , Summers had led a mere handful of riders out to hunt the scattered cattle . With him away  --  and with him his precious right to name and organizewar parties  --  Tadlock had appointed other riders , until nearly every last manjack was gone . But still the train went on , the ox teams poked by women and the bigger children . A storm came up that morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and later soaked it , so that the rearward wagons floundered half-stuck in the mire . The rain was cold , slanted by a chilly breeze . The drivers climbed up in the wagons to escape it and got colder yet for want of exercise and climbed back down and stumped along , their feet heavy and misshapen with the clinging mud . But they went on . That was the point . Women driving , children driving , they went on . Tadlock had shown the way , since Summers was scouting with the men , but often he turned back to give his people help and heart . One thing he could do , he 'd have to say for himself , was to get an ox to pull . Give him his whip and he could lift a piece of hide . More than once that day he 'd taught a team a thing or two . He taught the Indians something , also , taught the six-man delegation that caught up with the train two hours or so after it had started out . Byrd , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men , had seen them first and managed to get himself aboard an extra horse and bounced ahead to give the news to Tadlock . The train was n't in position to corral . It had spread out in the mud . The going was too heavy for a quick maneuver . A hill rose to the right . Trees grew to left . All these considerations came to Tadlock while Byrd pantedp113out his message . On the instant he saw them clear and knew what he would have to do . " Get the women armed ! " he barked . " You and Willie Brewer and the preacher come to the rear , with rifles . " He jammed a fresh cap on his own . " How many Indians ? " " I just caught a glimpse . " " How far away ? " " Close . " " Do what I tell you ! " Tadlock dug his heels into his horse and galloped toward the line , leaving Byrd to follow . He held up his hand for a halt . He could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strip of woods , lost in the mist . Charging by the wagons , Tadlock saw the white faces of the women , the suddenly frightened faces of children , the face of his wife written over with anxiety . He hoped that , beholding him , they were finding courage . A hundred yards below the tail-end wagon he spied the Indiansriding from a brake . He slowed his horse and walked it toward them . Six Indians . That was all he saw . Six Kaws , he guessed they were , with roached hair mussed by rain , with odds and tatters of attire glued wet against their skins . The leader had a soggy blanket draped around him . Tadlock caught the black-wet shimmer of gun steel , the tight arch of a bow . A mangy set but maybe mean , he thought , and rode straight at them until they pulled their horses up . He stared at them , making his face as tight and blank as theirs . It stirred his pride to think , as he went from gaze to gaze , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heady , hard conflictof wills . He asked , " What you want ? " They were a long time answering . Never , he imagined , had they been received like this . They expected the pipe , the oratory , the soft courtesies that were the custom . The Kaw with the blanket spoke . " Kill Injun . " He pointed back , toward where Mack had dropped the Indian from the tree . " Kill Injun , yes , " Tadlock answered . " Injun steal , so kill In-jun . " " Injun no steal . "  | " Injun steal . Heap dead . " " Injun love presents . " " No presents . " Tadlock saw thought working in their eyes . He saw what he supposed was disappointment rising from his refusal to make amends with gifts . Now was the time , he knew . Now was the danger . But still he felt no fear . Looking at this ill-fed , scrapclothedcrew , he felt power surging in him , power to bend them , power to treat them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one sweep of the hand , he could wipe them from the earth . He caught the leader 's gaze and stared it down . In the flush of certitude he said , " Get ! " and hitched his rifle closer . He said , " Now get ! " and touched his horse a step ahead . He was the master of them . One by one they turned . The eyes sliding off from his had a look of craven injury . They filed back as they had come . He sat straight and still , by his power and presence willing them away , until the last of them was gone from sight . He had reassured the women afterwards , had got the train to moving , had met the riders coming in and told them no , it was n't time to camp . Rain , mud , Indians , scattered cattle  --  and still the train had rolled a decent distance . Eight miles , maybe ten , he estimated . Which showed what management could do . Which showed what a little spunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he heard the women talking of it to their men . It was no more than the duty of a captain to his company . He 'd do the same again in spite of Summers , who said , " It worked this time , but do n't never try it on a Pawnee or a Sioux . " That night he let it be known the cattle guards would have to show some sense . The idea , firing at imaginary Indians and so causing a stampede ! Of course the Indians were imaginary . Had n't the riders found all the animals but one ? Had they spied a single thief ? He did n't hide his sentiments about Mack and his behavior , either . Not that one Indian mattered much . It was the consequences possible . The men took it well enough then . They knew they had it coming . But now , because he said a sick man did n't justify delay , be/cause he said Martin would be as well off in a wagon , they acted up ! Tadlock popped another blade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the council to meet , but for a minute longer he stood where he was , pecking at the ground with his whip . He saw , again with approval , that other women had joined the group at the river 's edge . One of the men had built a fire for them , and water was heating in a tub and a couple of buckets , sending up wisps of steam into air still a little chill from the night . To the south the animals grazed , herded loosely . Three horsemen were splashing across the river , hurrying to keep from miring in the quicksand that formed the bed . He identified them one by one  --  Summers and Gorham and the boy , Brownie Evans . He supposed they were going to hunt the buffalo that grazed northward . It irritated him that they should set out , for buffalo grazing at a distance , away from where the road led . It was as if they assumed already , prior to the action of the council , that the train would n't move . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an act of impudence , if these people understood that word . He blamed Summers most of all  --  and not for this small offensealone . He had the feeling that Summers contaminated the company with his casual independence , his backwoodsman 's uncertain respect for authority . Summers knew the trail . He was a good guide , an expert hunter , a watchful scout , a neversleepingsentinel . He was all of these , Tadlock had to admit to himself , but he was also a man hard to manage or impress , a man admired for his Indian graces and rude skills and so imitatedin attitudes . Walking to the council meeting , Tadlock found himself wishingresentfully that he had Summers ' frontier lore to go along with his own impulse for order . It was Summers who suggested , along the Little Blue , that horses be tied to the branches , not the trunks , of trees . That way , he said , they would n't break the bridle reins . Summers could lure buffalo cows to him by imitatingthe call of a calf . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leave life enough in her to drive her close to camp , thus eliminating the chore of packing in the meat . And whop116but Summers would think of tying his horse to the horns of a killed buffalo while he butchered ? Summers could handle oxen , mules , horses . He could , it seemed , smell game and water and Indians . He was deadly with rifle and bow . He struck the quickest fire . The manner in which he rounded the wagons into a corral at night was simple and effective , though it did lack military style . For himself , Tadlock would have preferred a method he had been told about , by which the train divided into equal sections , with an officer for each , and made smart right-angle turns and formed a square . Still , he had to admit , Summers ' way was good . Damn the man , anyhow ! He was competent  --  though outwardly modest if somehow insolent  --  and independent as a hog on ice ! Why could n't a man of wider view , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a qualification as it was , it still would promote the recognition of leadership . The other councilmen , out fifty yards or so from the wagons , were waiting . Tadlock checked them off  --  Evans , Fairman , Mack , Brewer , Daugherty . He sat down by them . " How 's Mar-tin ? " " No good , " Brewer answered in his thick German . " He vill die , you bet . " " He 's tough . " Evans said , " My woman 's watchin ' him , along with Brother Weatherby and some others . " Tadlock nodded , thinking not so much about Martin as about the council , as about an issue that had grown beyond its true importance because it was a challenge to authority . He wished , almost , that he had proposed the delay . Still , it was all right . Brewer he could count on , and Mack and Fairman . They and he would compose a majority . " Still could make ten miles or so , " he said , squinting at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't answer . Only Brewer , sitting cross-legged , his paunch spilling over into his lap , so much as nodded . " Martin 's out of his head , " Daugherty said in what might have been reproach . Tadlock sized him up , wondering now as he had wonderedp117before why this hillside Irishman opposed him . Could he have overheard some incautious criticism of popishness ? " Just yells Jesus , " Evans added . " Yells Jesus and follers with To Thee I pray . ' " " That does n't show he 's out of his head . " " He was niver a great one for prayin ' , " Daugherty said . Tadlock had the feeling that in their faces was the look of something withheld . He studied them , then let his gaze stray off to the camp where the wagons stood idle and the new-done wash stirred on lines the women had run from wagon to wagon . He saw the tent that had been put up to shelter Martin and Weatherby standing by it , his rusty coat donned out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagons and the fires that were being allowed to die . Women always managed to improve the movement , Tadlock reflected while his eyes went from them to four men who lay by Patch 's wagon . One of them was stabbing idly at the ground with a knife . He thought he could hear Martin 's voice , maybe crying to Jesus . " Well , " he said , " we have a decision to make . " They did n't answer him . They sat waiting , their lids narrowedagainst the sun . It would be warm today and dazzlingly bright , the sun striking back from the sand and the saltlike patches that lay on it . He caught Evans ' eye . " You 're willing to abide by the decisionof the council ? " " Are you ? " " Naturally . " Tadlock gave his attention to the others . " We need to remember that the trick is to keep moving . It will be late fall before we reach Oregon in any case . " Evans brought his hand to his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think . " I ai n't denyin ' what you say , Tadlock , but we been makin ' good time . It ai n't as if we could n't spare a day or two . " " We 'll meet other delays , you know . " " Maybe so . " " Delays we ca n't avoid . " Evans changed his position on the ground . When he spoke he looked at the others . " It do n't seem to me we have to be sop118hellbent to beat everybody . Way I figure , we 'll pass and be passed before this jig is over . " Mack said , " You 're half racehorse , Irvine . You 're bred to run in front . " " Ya . Better to keep ahead , you bet , " Brewer said . In his astonishment at Mack , in his rising vexation , Tadlock spoke sharply . " If someone did n't push , the whole company would sit on its tail . " " If one of us was sick , I think we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So they were all against him , Tadlock thought incredulously , all but the thickheaded German . He had led them , he had worked , organized , directed , pushed  --  and they were all against him . Or were they ? When it came finally to decision , would n't Mack and Fairman side with him ? " Let 's vote , " he said . " Mack , Fairman , I assume you 'll support my recommendation . " Mack answered , " No . " The smile was gone from his face . Fairman was shaking his head . " No ! " " No , " Mack said again . Fairman kept shaking his head . Evans tossed a piece of buffalo dung at his old gray-whiskered dog , which was digging in a hole near by . " Reckon you 'll have to wait , Tadlock , " he said . Tadlock felt the blood hot in his face . " All I have to say is that it 's a goddam-fool decision . " Mack spoke quietly . " I have to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's a meeting tonight . " " Meeting ? " " Whole company . " " For what ? " " Ca n't you guess ? " " This is a guessing game , is it ? " " They 're going to unseat you , Irvine . " " You 're a goddam liar ! " " I 'll wait for your apology . " The meaning of Mack 's words , the full import , came to Tadp119lock slowly . He clenched words back while he considered it . They meant to kick him out . They meant to elect a new captain . He could see how the thing had come about . Patch , the little , stiff-necked New Englander , Daugherty , Gorham , Carpenter  --  thesemen , he had known , opposed him , and now they had politicked around , trading on the unpopularity of leadership , making big this little issue of the sick man . " We 'll see about that , " he said to Mack . " I 'll stand on my position about Martin . " " Ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mack asked . " I see . I called you a fool , and that 's what you were . " " The world is all a fool to you , " the Irishman put in . " I was a fool all right , " Mack said , the color climbing in hisface , " but it 's not that either , Irvine . It 's the airs you have . It'soverbearance . " " And it is your animals and not enough men for them that slow the train  --  and you foriver cryin ' for speed , " Daugherty added . " And it is you and your pushiness that sour us , and that 's the God 's truth . " " You say you 're not sore , " Tadlock said to Mack . " Then where do you stand ? " " I 've got to vote for harmony . " " What about you , Fairman ? " Fairman said , " Same here . " " You ca n't get away with it . " " You tell him , Brewer , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German explained . " McBee , too . But ve not be enough . " So it was true . So they had conspired against him . So he had to resign or suffer the humiliation of being voted out . Brewer would n't lie to him . " That 's the thanks a man gets . I 've worked , figured , risked my neck . " Evans said  --  and Mack nodded to the words  --  " That 's what makes it hard , Tadlock . " " I can split this train in two . I have a few friends . " " You 're losin ' ' em by the minute , " Evans said with what for him was heat . Tadlock lurched to his feet . " To hell with all of you ! " Notp120until he had taken a half a dozen steps away could he bring himself to throw back , " I resign . " Tadlock walked to his lead wagon . " I just quit , " he told his wife . She was seated on a box , mending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wagon . She gazed at him without speaking . " It was resign or get kicked out , " he went on , getting a kind of perverse satisfaction out of the admission . Still she did n't speak . In ten years of married life , he thought with a stir of pleasure , she had learned better than to inquire into his business . What he wanted her to know , he would tell her . He waited , almost hoping she would put a question so that he could spend his outrage on her . When he did n't go on , she said , " Martin 's worse . " " I guess that 's my fault ! " " I did n't mean it was anybody 's fault . " " If we 'd been traveling , everyone would have said it was mine . They 'd have been glad to say that . " " I 'm glad you resigned . " " So you 're glad , are you ! " " You take it so hard . " He grunted , disarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much he gave . She stitched quietly for a minute as if thinking about him and his resignation , but when she spoke it was to say , " Martin depended on you . I think you were the only friend he had . " " I do n't know anything to do for him . " " I know , but  --  " He walked around to Martin 's tent . Brother Weatherby was outside , holding an old Bible . Tadlock asked , " Well ? " " I have been praying . The Lord 's will be done . " " Out of his head ? " " Now . Yes . " Tadlock stuck his head inside the tent . Martin lay on his back , his mouth open and his eyeballs showing white through lids not quite closed . Listening , Tadlock heard the light , fastp121breath of fever . He stepped back , repelled by the sight and sound and smell of sickness . There was nothing he could do , he told himself . What did they think he was ? A doctor ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Calomel work ? " Weatherby nodded , and Tadlock went back to his wagon . He spent a bitter , fiddley day . He kept going over what had happened and experienced each time a renewed injury and anger . He examined and repaired wagons and equipment and went back twice to Martin 's tent . On his second trip he found Martin alone and soiled and senseless . Here was something he could do . Here was something , by God , he would do . No one could say he was indifferent or neglectful or heedless of the discipline he asked of others . Washing Martin off , he wonderedfiercely who would do as much . As he finished , Byrd came in . Byrd had a lancet and thought , like others , that bleeding would be good for Martin . Tadlock helped bleed him . The meeting of the men at night was what might have been expected  --  a common hurly-burly made more orderless by the women and children who were allowed to press around . Thinkingabout it afterwards , Tadlock was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He would have sworn that Patch was agitating in the interests of himself . Evans himself had acted honestly astonished when Mack put his name in nomination . He had turned and looked at his wife and then stumbled ahead . " Nope , Mr. Chairman . I ai n't cut out for it . " Seated at a little distance where he could hear and see enough but still not dignify the meeting with his presence , Tadlock had caught the look on Mrs. Evans ' face . It was an expression he could n't describe , of motherliness , concern , pride , assurance , ambition  --  he did n't know what . But for an instant , before he thrust it aside , he had the feeling it would be good to be looked at that way . His second thought was that only big , dull , forcelessmen ever could be so regarded . Another thing stuck in his memory as he sat by his wagon in the gathering dark after the meeting had adjourned . It was the parliamentary disorder that was allowed to prevail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While Evans ' namep122was still in nomination , Turley piped up , irrelevant to the subject , and Patch let him proceed . " We 're a-turnin ' back . " Turley'svoice was a high whine . " Me and my woman and young-'uns , we 're a-turnin ' back , by Moses ! " Mrs. Turley shouted from among the women , " Amen ! Amen ! " Tadlock heard her crying hysterically afterwards , as he had heard overwrought women cry at revivals . " We 're headin ' backwards for the Meramec , " Turley went on , " seein 's this company wo n't wait for others and seein 's everybody is at outs besides . Who wants to turn back with us , welcome . " Patch asked , " What about it , Summers ? " Summers stood off to Patch 's right . He said one word : " Dan-gerous . " A little silence followed  --  except for Mrs. Turley 's crying  --  that Patch broke by asking , " Anyone else want to turn back ? " He waited . " Byrd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was good management , was one accidental stroke of good management . Let Byrd say yes or no . Get him committed and hold him to it . Byrd said he 'd stick . Patch went on , " If anyone plans to split off from the train , we 'd like to know it now . " He did n't look toward Tadlock but others turned to do so . Tadlock stared back , silent and unmoving . Split off ? How could he split off ? It was an impulsive threat he 'd made . Who would go with him ? Brewer and McBee and Martin , maybe , if he lived . A sorry lot , without oxen enough and some of those already sore of foot . He sat stiff and wordless , but he wanted to jump up and cry out , calling them the ingrates that they were . He felt like rising with his whip and lashing them one and all until they saw the truth of things . Cattle ? Drivers ? The charge was just a cheap excuse . Had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finally made a deal with Hank McBee to help out with the hundred and ten head of stock he had ? Had n't he done the best he could  --  and not because they forced him to it , either ? For a long time after the session was over Tadlock sat still ,  |p123seeing  but still not seeing the people who passed gingerly , knowing his wife had gone somewhere and wondering how she could mix with those who had mistreated him . The camp quieted to low , good-night tones and by and by they quieted , too , and of human voices there was just a murmur from Martin 's tent , which had been pitched at the other side of the corral where water was close . One by one the fires winked out . The stars came on , cold-bright as faraway suns . Southward Tadlock could see the horizon rolling against the sky . A child cried in one of the tents , cried a frail cry that silence closed around . Tadlock , he thought , trying to see the name apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business in Peoria to try his talents in a bigger field and had been undone by ragtag emigrants . Tadlock , who liked discipline and method and knew how to organize , who , but for the stories this crowd would take along , might in time have been the territorial governor , the governor of the eventual state . What now ? he asked . What , since these chuckleheads could blight him ? Texas ? Could he get to Texas ? Just this past spring it had been asked into the Union . It would need leaders  --  a governor , senators , representatives . California ? Some said Californiawas a better place than Oregon . It would offer opportunities . It would stand in need of able men . He felt his wife 's hand on his shoulder . " You 'd better come to bed , Irvine . " " I know when it 's bedtime . You do n't need to tell me when to go to bed . " " It 's late , Irvine . " " What of it ? I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been there . There 's nothing more you can do . They 're trying mustard . " " You go on to bed . " He waited a few minutes , just to assert himself , and then got up and went into the tent and took off his coat and hat and shoes . Texas ? California ? They needed men all right . They needed leaders . He stepped outside in his bare feet and picked up the whipp124that he had forgotten on the ground and put it in his wagon and went back into the tent and lay down by his wife . He was just getting to sleep , after what seemed a lifetime of sleeplessness , when Weatherby came by to tell him Martin had died . Chapter Thirteenp125Evans LAID the yoke on one of his oxen and pinned the bow and spoke to the teammate , holding the yoke up while the second animal stepped into place , its ankles creaking . It was a satisfaction to a man to have well-trained stock , he told himself while he worked . Saved time and trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitch , he looked at the watch Mack had lent him . Six-forty . He would be ready in good time , as befitted the captain . Not all the tents were struck yet , nor the wagons loaded . Inside the corral where he stood some of the other men were beginning to get busy with oxen just driven in , and outside it others were pulling tent pegs and lowering poles and folding the tents afterwards and then lifting their plunder into the wagons . They worked fast , gruntingto their chores as men did with sleep still in them and the muscles stiff from the night . The women had scraped and scoured the breakfast things and stood inside the wagons , helpingarrange the loads . Or they had wandered off , some with their young ones in tow , to empty themselves and so be ready for the morning drive . Morning , Evans thought , was a time of fret , before the circle broke and the train got strung out on the trail . When the men quit their grunting it was to speak sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired , too , and felt the load of the day too heavy . The young ones cried or yelled , being cranky or frisky , one . The boxes made a clatter as they were pitched into wagon beds . Now and then one of the oxen driven in for yoking would line out neck and head and let out a long bawl . Underneaththe louder noises was the steady hum of mosquitoes that made a little cloud around every head . Evans stooped and gave Rock a pat on the head and straightenedand stretched , pulling in a deep breath through his mouth.  |p126The  air had a taste to it here , a taste light and sharp as highspiritdrink . For all the fret he felt good . " Be a nice day , Becky , " he said , looking between the wagons to where she worked outside . She had just closed and latched with its leather hasp the box that held pots and kettles and tools to eat with . " I almost wish it would blow and clear out the mosquitoes , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll . Ai n't hardly a stir of air . " It was cool enough , but the sun was beginning to work . In the direction of it he saw Courthouse Rock , looming big yet , its near side purple with shadow . Off to his right apiece Chimney Rock rose slim and rusty . In a land that was all pretty much the same a man would n't think to see so much color  --  purple and rust , the gray of the sandbars , the sun slanted yellow as butter on the long flats , the sky so blue it hurt the eye . In all the sky there was n't a cloud . He said , " I never feel so sure as on a good morning . " " Sure ? " " About everything . " He stepped across and lifted the cookboxand put it in the wagon and brought the cover snug with its drawstring . " Nothing left but to hitch . " He stepped back into the corral and angled through the oxen , looking to see if anyone needed help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an ornery steer . They had a rope over its horns that Hig was trying to hold while Fairman lifted the yoke . They held up when they saw him . Hig gave Evans his thin smile while he bent back with the rope . " I 'd as lief yoke a buffalo as this damn ox . " " Why n't you take a hitch on a spoke ? " " Comin ' to that , " Hig answered . " On'y I hate to . I got a bet up with this critter , by God , that I 'll hold him or bust . " Keepingthe rope tight with one hand , he took the loose end of it with the other and looped it over a wheel spoke and drew it up . " I 'm busted . " Evans clapped the ox on the rump . It stepped ahead balkily while Hig snubbed it.  | " I 'm shy of good work stock , " Fairman said , his forehead wrinkled with the thought of it . He rubbed the mosquitoes off the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hoofs down to nothing . " " Same with all of us . By and by the hoofs 'll get tougher , they tell me . I been cleanin ' ' em off and puttin ' hot tar in the cracks . " Evans walked on . Dick Summers was throwing packs on a couple of horses , packs that held his little plunder and that of Brother Weatherby . Weatherby stood by , as always , looking as if he 'd like to help if only he knew how . Evans spoke to them and got Dick 's quiet grin and a solemn nod from Weatherby . " Ready , " Dick said , tying one horse to the pack saddle of the other . He took the lead rope . " Reckon they 'd foller all right , but maybe I better tie on to your wagon again . Might scour off . " " I 'll be along . " It seemed everybody was about ready , even the McBees , who could n't ever seem to be on time . Until lately they could n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was working all right , Evans thought , feeling again part proud and part guilty that it was . He had n't been captain long until he called the men together one night , to find what was on their minds and to hear any grumbles and especially to cure the fault of late and ragged starting . He had told Mack his idea , and Mack had helped him , asking the men how about it : if a man was late he lost his place in line and had to bring up the rear ? They had thought it was Mack 's plan and had voted yes and now no one was late ; but still Evans felt a little guilty . It struck him as somehow sneaky , this trick of rigging a meeting . It was better , though , than layingdown the law on his own , better than cracking an ox whip . McBee said , " How be you ? " and Mrs. McBee stuck her head from the tail of the wagon and gave him a pleasant good morning . Three McBee boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking at Evans from under hair that did n't know a comb . Evans did n't see Mercy around . " What we waitin ' fer ? " McBee asked , set up over being ready . His whiskers moved to a smile.  |p128Evans  consulted his watch . " ' Bout time . " Looking between the wagons , he saw the horse herd , out for its quick morning graze , and the loose cattle that Brownie and the other drivers had brought close . " Been meanin ' to talk to you , " McBee told him as if he had something important on his mind . " About what ? " " I 'll be seein ' you . It 's personal-like . " So it was personal . Evans did n't like the thought . " Any time . " He went over to his own wagons and hitched the teams and saw Rebecca to her perch and took out his watch again . It was time , lacking a minute or so . Summers sat a horse at the wagon that would break the circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the start . Mounted near Summers were Shields and Carpenter and Brewer , who would ride ahead today . Evans could see Tadlock standing alongside Summers , holding his silver trumpet . Evans had asked Tadlock if he would n't keep on sounding the horn , just as he did while captain . Out of a kind of sympathy he 'd asked him , thinking maybe Tadlock prized the task . Besides , the trumpet was Tadlock 's . Evans had to grin at himself , wondering which was the real reason . Anyhow , Tadlock had agreed , in that new and hard-eyed way of his . Tadlock looked across at him , and Evans raised his arm , and the trumpet sounded . Teamsters spoke . Whips popped . Oxen pushed into the yokes . Axles whined . Dust puffed up . With commands and pops , with whines and dust the circle unwound . The On-to-Oregon train was rolling . Evans ' place was near the tail of the line . Walking out a little from his team , he could see Summers and the horsemen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon to wagon growing as the train settled to the drive . They would be farther spread before the morning was over . It was a thing he must watch , he reminded himself . They could be too far spread for safety against Indians . Back of him the loose stock was ambling into line . Indians could raise the devil if they wanted to , though he did n't look for them to do it , not since a bunch of mounted soldiers had passed by . Dragoons , they called themselves , thep129First Dragoons , led by a Colonel Kearny , who said their purposewas to awe the Indians and to warn them they 'd better leave the emigrants alone . Three hundred men or thereabouts were in the bunch , not to mention wagons drawn by mules and two wheeled cannons and butcher beef and sheep that came along behind . They were in a hurry , bound for Laramie and onward to the Southern Pass , where they 'd turn back . Watchingthem press on , their blues and golds proud in the rising dust , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were right enough . People were in good spirit and in good health except for the diarrhea that Platte water or too much fresh meat brought on . They had got across the South Platte , double-yoking every wagon on the advice of Summers and stringing ropes between some and splashing through the quicksand fast . For a while they had followed along the north shore and then angled across and come to Ash Hollow and the North Fork . It was a good place to remember , Ash Hollow was . There was shade there and cool-water springs and good grass , and the wagons had got down the hills that ringed it with no more damage than one tip-over . So , in time , they had reached Courthouse Rock and the tower that stood close by and had camped on a creek there , and people had felt like celebrating , as if , coming to a known name , they could be sure they were on the right track . Or more as if they were nearing home and had caught sight of a thing to mark it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had held services , and nobody had made light of him , thinking of Martin and the Turleys . For a long time the Turleys had been in sight after the train pulled out . They had squatted there with their old wagon and their few head of stock , refusing to go with the company but still not starting the other way , as if quitting the bunch had taken all their get-up and now they would just wait for whatever . They had squatted , Turley and Mrs. Turley and their two thin children , watching out of stubborn eyes , saying thanks and no more for the sweetening and flour and bacon that Rebecca and Mrs. Mack and Mrs. Tadlock had left with them against the time that buffalo and antelope ran out . To watch them , to hearp130their noisy mouths now held to a bare word or two , a man would think that the company was treating them wrong . It was n't so , but still no one felt quite easy . Like the others , Evans kept turning his head as the train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Turleys were  --  a man and his woman and his young ones and a ramshackleoutfit pressed on all sides by the great emptiness , or not pressed but loose and lost on the long flats , among the bald sand hills . After what seemed a long time the Turleys had got moving , pulling a little tail of dust and shrinking with distance until at last distance swallowed them . Trying to spot them , Evans could n't be sure but what he saw was just a fleck in the eye . He was n't extra religious , but he felt better because Weatherby had prayed for them , begging God to keep the Indians off , and the storms and the accidents , and please , God , guard Thy sheep . Just before , Weatherby had given Martin into God 's keeping . Evans and Summers and Tadlock himself had dug the grave , dug it in silence while each man thought his own thoughts , and when it was ready they laid Martin by it , and Weatherby came and read out of the Book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one , they wrapped Martinin the blanket he laid on and lowered him and shoveled the sand in . Then Dick burned gunpowder over the grave and had them trail the stock across . That way , he said , wolves or Indians were n't likely to find the body . Neither , Evans figured , was anyone else , or anything . It was a lost grave as soon as left , and Martin'sbones would lie in it till kingdom come , and buffalo would gallop over the spot and wolves trot across and wagon trains track it , and none would know that here lay what was left of a man  --  a dull-eyed man with bowed shoulders but with hankeringsand troubles and rights of his own , who had set out for Oregon and got sick and cried out to Jesus and died . Evans thought with a little turn about shaving Martin . Rebeccasaid he ought to do that . A man should go to his grave looking decent , she said . And so he had scraped off the wiry whiskers , and they had dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't much , though Martin made a nice-enough looking corpse , considering . The train had got under way then , Evans feeling low in his , mind and small in his new place as captain , as if he could n't come it , and Dick had ridden up and unforked his horse and walked along with him . He was glad for Dick 's friendship . He leaned on Dick . He was stronger inside because of him . Maybe that showed he was n't fit for captain . Maybe a captain ought to be stout enough to stand alone , wanting no help from anyone except the help that would be expected of any pilot , like advice on crossings and routes and watch-outs for Indians . Well , that was n't how he was cut . Never , anywhere , had he wanted to be boss . So he would lean on Dick , and when hard questions came up he would call the council together . They would have solid ideas , But there would still be times , he realized uncomfortably , when he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a leaner and a caller of meetings . He had to give confidence to people , and encouragement . He had to see , one way or another , that the train kept together and kept going . He had to lead , no matter if he did n't want to , else the train would fail . He wished he had just his own family to watch out for . Evans blew the dust out of his nose and brought a hand up and wiped his eyes . The valley was deeper here and narrower , and a traveler saw new kinds of plants , like the spiny clumps that Summers called Spanish bayonet and Weatherby said was Adam 's needle . Flowers he did n't have a name for waved along the way , some coned and some daisied , colored purple and white and yellow . The women and children were forever pickingposies if the day was fair . Here they would have to be careful . Rattlesnakes were getting thick . It would be just luck if someone did n't get bit . The thought troubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a way it was as if all hands had entrusted their future to him , expecting him to have the sense and force to see them through . And some of them he hardly knew , except to pass a good morning ! There was Fairman 's man , Botter , and Mack 's Land , Moss , and Shields and Carpenter and Insko and Davis/worth . They had voted for him , he reckoned , or anyhow not against him . He made a note to himself to get better acquainted . Because they were not forward men or easy met , he had let himself stand off . A captain ought to know his company down to the last pup . He looked back and saw that Rebecca had climbed from the wagon and was walking alongside . He winked at her . She had thinned some on the road , but she did n't seem so worn as before or to get so tired and sore . He did n't know when he had seen more life in her face . He cleaned his nose again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . He figured he would arrive in Oregon with some of the Platte sand on him . Sandy water did n't wash off sand . Anyhow the wind was n't pushing at them today . The dust puffed straight up and powdered him and settled back slow , so that , turning again , he saw the hanging trail of it far beyond the cattle . The sun rode friendly , just warm enough for comfort . A few white clouds had come into the sky . The mosquitoeshad thinned out , likely resting for the night siege . The Tadlock wagons rolled ahead of him , Tadlock walking by the side , still wearing the many-pocketed coat he had put on in the chill of early morning . He walked straight and square , with his head up . Tadlock had taken his upset fairly well , Evans said to himself , feeling easier at the thought . He had stuck mostly to himself , not marching around with his eye out for fault , but he stood his turn at guard and spoke civil enough , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Brewer , now that Martin was dead , for Brewer 's twelve-year-old to help with the stock and spell Mrs. Tadlock at his second wagon . Evans hawed his team , following the swing-out of the line . The wagons creaked and jolted and in some places ground in the sand . Now and then he could hear the rattle of a loose tire that Hig , the handyman , would have to fix . He had a system better than driving wedges between tire and felloe . He took the tire off and shaved a thin hoop and tacked it to the felloe andp133heated the tire and put it back on . Made something extra doing it , too , though he would rather play his fiddle for a reel . At Laramie there would be a bellows and other tools , probably , and they could cut and weld the tires and fit them snug . Until then Hig 's system was all right . They would buy supplies at Laramie , too , if they could , stuff like flour and smoked buffalotongues . And some were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far to Laramie ? How far did Dick say from Chimney Rock ? Sixty miles or so ? With good going they would be there in four days , five anyhow . Ahead and to the left the hills were beginning to run high and ragged , leading , Evans supposed , to Scott 's Bluffs . Closer at hand he saw a half dozen wild horses gazing down from the ridge , their heads held high . While Evans watched , McBee came riding up from the cow column , his whiskers gray with dust . He spit and smiled . " Crittersare gettin ' along all right . I 'll keep my eye back . " It was the report , Evans understood , of a man to his captain , the report unasked and needless , said to show the sayer knew the due of leadership . He did n't like it or the manner of its saying . McBee got off his horse and walked along with Evans . " ' Y God , she 's a fair day . " " Good enough for anyone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw old Rock following at his heels . He wondered then if the only reason he did n't take to McBee was that McBee had wanted to kill his dog . No , he decided . He would n't go for McBee regardless . He was dirty and shiftless , and there was nothing to him anyhow . Not to him or his wife , either  --  and how they got a pretty thing like Mercy beat him . He had to admit she was not only pretty but seemed to be a goodenoughgirl . She could n't be much underneath , though , not with that breeding . Give her a few years and a few young ones and she 'd be just like Ma and Pa , he guessed , and then brought himself up . He reckoned the Lord had the right to visit the sins of the father  --  but not Lije Evans . He owed her a chance , just as a man owed anyone a chance , but still he was relieved that Brownie was n't following after her.  | " I said to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to make it . Fer a time I did n't know , fer a fact . " Evans tried to imagine what McBee 's face was like under the mat of whiskers . Slack-jawed , probably , and loose-lipped . Weak . And yet there was something tough about him , as there was often about ornery people , something that kept him going , something tougher than the stuff of Turleys . " Yes , sir , we 're a-goin ' to make it . " McBee grinned , showing teeth broken and dirty beyond believing , and bobbed his head . Watching him , hearing him , Evans knew . This was it , plain in the words , the smiles , the bobs of the head . McBee meant them to be admiring . McBee was courting the captain . He was honey-fuggling , wanting the importance of the shadow of importance . He would have something especial to say ; he would have something to bring up  --  but this was it . " We always were going to make it , " Evans said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now . " Evans did n't give him an answer . He knew what he ought to do . He ought to tell McBee to go to hell ; but it was a hard thing . Somehow a man balked at slapping the compliment out of another 's mouth . Not that it was the compliment , either . Compliments did n't fool him . He just hated to speak blunt to friendliness , even if the friendliness was only a show . McBee said , " I been meanin ' to tell you , I do n't hold no hard feelin 's . About the dog and all . Nary one . " " All right . None here , either . Over that . " " Like my woman was sayin ' today , you was bound to work up to captain . " " I did n't work for it . " " Course not . " Evans turned on him then and spoke with more than the needed stress because he disliked what he had to say . " McBee , you better stick with Tadlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his puddled brown eyes Evans saw the sudden , skulky glint of hatred . " Oh , sure . I aim to do that . " He walked along in silence for a while , leading his horse , and then said , " Reckon I better be gettin ' back . " He climbed the horse and rode away.  |p135Evans  watched him and then shortened his gaze , seeing Rebeccasmiling the twisted smile of knowing and old Rock paddingbetween them . Now , more than ever , he told himself , he would have to watch the man , not for any open act but for some sly and miserabletrick . He would ask Brownie to keep close watch on their stock , as he would himself . It was hard to believe anyone was underhanded , though , until the proof came out . Chapter Fourteen  | FROM THE SLOPE to the southeast the forts shone white in afternoon sun except where the long shadows of the trees fell across . Spotted on the bottom were the tepees that the Sioux had pitched , looking white , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement below , men and women comingand going , children dodging among the lodges , the thin Indian dogs limping , nosing low for scraps , and , farther out , the horses beginning to graze as the afternoon cooled . Summers sat his horse and watched , thinking how things had changed . This country was young , like himself , when he saw it first , young and wild like himself , without the thought of age . There was n't a post on it then , nor any tame squaw begging calico , but only buffalo and beaver and the long grass waving in the Laramie bottoms . The wind had blown lonesome , the sound of emptiness in it , the breath of far-off places where no white foot had stepped . A man snuggling in his robe had felt alone and strong and good , telling himself he would see where the wind came from . Now there was n't a buffalo within fifty miles or beaver either  --  the few that were left of them  --  and the wind brought words and the hammer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living under roof . The far post near the neck of the Laramie and the Platte would be Fort Platte , built after Summershad left the mountains ; the near one Fort Laramie , or William , as some had called it , but even it had changed . Change coming on change , he thought . He remembered it from ' thirtysix  --  orwas it ' thirty-seven ?  --  when it was a cottonwood post like any other . Now it was ' dobe and white and spiked at the top like a castle might be , and the trade was in buffalo skins that a true mountain man would n't mess with . Beyond , the Black Hills climbed away , dark with their scrub  |p137cedar  and pine , with Laramie Peak rising oversized among them . Farther on , out of sight , there were the Red Buttes and the Sweetwater and the Southern Pass and the Green , where he had spent his young years like a trapper spent his beaver , thinkingthere was always more where that came from . On the near side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Popo Agie . He formed the words with his lips , remembering how a Crow girl had got the sound of running water in them . Ashia , the Crow word for stream . Popo Ashia . The liquid sound , the girl warm at his side and both of them fulfilled for the time and easy , and she laughing while he practiced the tongue . Even her name was lost to him now , and she was dead or old , one , and the laughter gone from her , and did she remember at all the Long Knife who had bedded with her ? He could n't bring her face back . What he remembered was the warmness and swell of her and the young-skinned thighs . They went along with the Popo Agie , with water running white and blue and the green trees rising and the Wind Mountains higher still and the rich lift from the dam that never had seen a trap before . He ought to be getting back to the train , but he stayed a minute longer while memory wakened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountains once and before that a part of the mountains themselves , and a man traveling had to keep his eye out and his hand ready , watching the way of his horse for Indian sign , watching the way of buffalo while he hung to his Hawken rifle . There was danger still , from Pawnees and Sioux and maybe Blackfeet farther on , but it struck him as different , as somehow piddling . A cornfield , even like the sorry patch by the fort , did n't belong with war whoops and scalping knives . It belonged with cabins and women and children playingsafe in the sun . It belonged with the dull pleasures , with the fat belly and the dim eye of safety . He had n't let himself think , back there in Missouri , how much of the old mountains there was still in him . He had butchered hogs and tended crops and dickered for oxen or mules and laid down at night by Mattie , shutting out the thought of beaver streams and canyons opening sweet to the eyep138and squaws who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost and wanted things . Popo Ashia , like running water . He was a mountain man underneath , and always would be , even if he went to plowing and hoeing and slopping hogs again  --  and there was no place in the world these days for a mountain man , and less and less of it all the time . A few years more and a man fool enough to trap like as not would stumble on to a picnic . The buffalo were thinning , for all that greenhorns said that three calves were dropped for every cow killed . In not so long a time now people in the mountains would be living on hog meat , unknowing the flavor and strength of fleece fat and hump ribs . Unknowing , either , how keen an enemy the Rees and the Blackfeet were . He almost wished for the old Rees , for the old Blackfeet that the white man 's pox had undone . They had given spirit to life ; every day lived was a day won . Well , he had set out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on hunting , finding a kind of pleasure in awakening memory , feeling the heart turn at the proof in mountainor park or river that , sure enough , once he had played here , once he had set traps and counted beaver and spreed at rendezvousand seen the wild moon rise . At the nub of it did he just want his youth back ? Beaver , streams , squaws , danger  --  were they just names for his young time ? Summers shook himself . Christ , a man could moon his life away ! Better to make the most of what was left . There was n't anything in feeling sorry for yourself . He reined around and rode back to the train . Rebecca Evans said , " I ca n't hardly wait to get to the fort . " She had stepped ahead , so as to walk beside Lije , letting the single yoke of oxen hitched to her wagon follow by itself . " That much farther along , " Lije said as if he knew what she meant . " Be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayin ' ? " " No longer'n need be . Day and a half . Maybe two days . We got to get on . " " Ai n't Laramie halfway , Lije ? " " Now , Becky , hopin ' it 's so wo n't make it so . "  | " How far ? " " Dick says somep'n over six hundred mile . " " And from there on ? " " Maybe thirteen hundred . " " An ' it 's the worst ? " He did n't answer to that but walked along pulling on a dead pipe , his face cheery , watching the wagons ahead and now and then looking back , making sure all was right . They had slanted out a piece from the river , to upland where the grass ran crisp under the wagon tires . With the thought of Laramie in their heads the teamsters were popping their whips or punching the oxen with sticks . The oxen did n't pay much notice . A sorefootedor worn-out ox never did . " We might have to stay longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Lije just got a bite on his pipe and shook his head . She sighed inside , thinking it would be good to stay at the fort the rest of her life and so be done with dirt and hard travel and eyes teary with camp smoke and the back sore from stoopingover a fire and the legs cramped from sitting on the ground . There she would n't have the grainy feel of sand forever in her shoes . " We 're comin ' along fine . " " Yes , " she said . " Fine . " Men were queer , she thought . Even Lije was queer , taking such a real and simple pleasure in the work of his muscles and the roll of wheels . The more miles they made the better-spirited he was , as if there was n't any aim in life but to leave tracks , no time in it but for go . He did n't mind eating mush with blown sand in it . She knew they had to get to Oregon all right . She knew they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-fired pleased , come night , that they were far gone from the morning . At night she felt tired and a little sad with tiredness and did n't like to think about tomorrow ; and she got to wondering then if Oregon was what it was cracked up to be . Lije liked the sun and even the wind and walked through the dust as if he had put it out of his mind , since he could n't still it . She found the sun cruel sometimes , lonely-cruel for allp140its brightness , and the wind sad-rough , and she hated the grind of sand between shoe and foot . " There 's Dick . " Ahead she saw Summers in his buckskins , waving the train on . She had to squint to see him , for the sun shone straight in her face unless she kept it tucked down under the shade of her poke bonnet . Her face , she knew , was a sight , reddened by the sun and coarsened by the wind until it was more man 's face than woman 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not dainty , she wanted to feel womanlike , to be clean and smooth-skinned and sometimes nice-dressed , not for Lije alone but for herself , for herself as a woman , so 's to feel she was a rightful being and had a rightful place . She thought ahead to the fort , to clear , hot water and time to wash up and maybe to ease the long ache of her bones ; and she thought backwards , too , to Missouri and the old springhouse and the fresh coolness of it and the milk creaming there in its pans . She thought of oak shade and trees fruiting and cupboards for dishes and victuals and chests for clothes and cookies baking and the smell of them following her around as the smell of camp smoke followed her now . She had had a home in Missouri , a place that stayed fixed , and , looking out door or window , she had known what she would see . She had been cozy there , seeing the hills and trees close and the sky bent down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to rest . It was the time of the month , she knew , for she had been doing better lately in body and mind both , but now she felt she could n't go on . Lije or no Lije , Brownie or no Brownie , she could n't go beyond Laramie . She wanted to slack down right here on the prairie and let the train roll on while the wind blew and the sun burned and the dog-tiredness eased away and the disquiet died and dust went back to dust . She stood still , not wanting Lije to catch sight of her face , and watched him push ahead while her own team came up . She fell into step alongside , saying to herself Lije was so gone on to Oregon he would n't think there was anything in her mind but to see to her wagon . She bent her head from the sun , watching one foot step out  |p141and  then the other and wondering that they did so , the way it was with her . Rock trotted up from somewhere and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he could scent the trouble inside her . While she patted Rock , she head Summers ' voice . Summers had ridden up and turned about and was riding half around in the saddle while he talked to Lije . " Laramie Fork ai n't so high . We can ford , I 'm thinking . " " Good . " " Best camp is west of the fort , on the bank . " Lije nodded . " You 'd best be callin ' on the bourgeois , too , Lije . " " Sure . Who is he ? " " Culbertson , Alexander Culbertson , used to be . Somewhere I heerd that Jim Bordeau was now . " " All right . " " How you , Mrs. Evans ? Rock ai n't dead yet , I see . " " He just this minute come up . I 'm tolerable . " " That 's slick . I 'll be gettin ' along , Lije . " The lead wagons were sinking from sight down a slope that Rebecca figured led to the Laramie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth pair by pair , and then the beds and then the swaying tops . Lije whoaed his oxen when he came to the top of the hill . Rebecca walked up to him and saw the train winding down and , below it , Fort Laramie , white as fresh wash , with trees waving and shade dark on the grass and the river fringed with woods . More to herself than to Lije she said , " I never thought to be so glad just to see a building . " " It 's Fort Laramie . Sure . " " Not because it 's a fort . Just because it 's a building . " " It 's Fort Laramie all the same . " " You reckon they 've got chairs there , Lije ? Real chairs . " There was a light in his eyes .

"  |p142She  thought she never had been so happy as now . The music had wings to it , and the night was wishful , and the big stars watched from overhead , looked down smiling and promising , just on Mercy McBee , so that , for this minute , she knew Pa was right . In Oregon everything would be different . Do-se-do . And how are you , Mr. Mack , with your white shirt and sleeves held up with their holders and the look of trouble gone from your forehead ? And did you know how often I thought of you , knowingI should n't , and looked for you along the dusty line of travel : Did you bump a-purpose , sir , doing do-se-do ? Music outside her . Music inside , singing talk she was too shy to say , singing talk outlandish that forever was her secret . The soft night around , lightened by the big fire that made little fires in the eyes of the Indians ringed about . Music 's got a time to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got a time . Let music move your feet . Swing , Mercy . Step out and swing , arm bent to arm . Saw , Hig , saw your fiddle , you and the dark part-Indian sawing with you . Saw in the night . Saw to the stars . Saw for little Mercy McBee who 's joined the grownups now and 's scared to speak a word . Watch , eyes . Watch , stars . Watch , wishful night . Mercy 's got a dress with a flouncy collar and her feet are in shoes , and who 's to know that once they fit old Mrs. Brewer , who needed help with her chirren ? Mercy can dance . Mercy 's good turned . I declare , I never saw the beat of her ! Arm tight in arm , tighter'n need be . Hand pressing hand . Men noticing . Important men with clean-shaved faces and solid ways and stout teams and cattle following behind the column . Men noticing , not boys , though boys took notice , too , the young fear showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byrd . You dance mighty pretty . Howdy , Botter , with your jaw of tobacco . Howdy , Mr. Fairman . You got a clever woman . No , I ai n't . I just wisht I could be as clever as her . Howdy , Mr. Gorham . Well , Mr. Mack , if it ai n't you again , and where 's your wife at ? Do n't she like to dance ? Bow to your partner and do-se-do and swing . The stars smil/ing , the night crowded in , the music with the high beat of the heart in it , the feet moving of themselves , the body moving , and things a-shine in Oregon . Mercy McBee ! Sixteen and dancing and happy , but scared almost to smile . Not knowing what to say . Not knowing how to answer to arms or pressing hands . So used to being biddable that words and wishes said and shown by older folks were still like orders to her . Hard tellin ' , Mr. Mack , hard tellin ' how to act when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as told . It ai n't I do n't like you . I do . I do . You 're clever and rich , and the likes of you 's never looked at the likes of me before , and I got a wanting to brush the black curl of hair back from your forehead . It 's just I do n't know . Growed up in body and not in knowing . That 's Mercy , Mr. Mack , and beg your pardon . Must be , sometime , you had to learn yourself . The music stopped . Hig laid his fiddle across his knees and put the bow with it and smiled his toothless smile . She let herselfsmile back , feeling at home with him for Hig was noaccountlike folks she 'd always known and full of jokes besides and would n't take too serious whatever she said or did . Mr. Mack 's voice spoke in her ear , spoke soft while people moved around . Would she like to take a walk ? Would she care to meet him out from the fire towards where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned was a half-smile that made him look like a boy , like a boy timid but with some unsaid notion in him . It was a nice night , he said , still talking low among the voices raised around them . The music would n't start up for a while , the fiddlers being tired . Would she care for a little walk ? She reckoned , inside , that she would , while for the moment her heart stood still , waiting her answer , afeard of yes and more afeard of no . She reckoned she 'd best as long as growed-up Mr. Mack had asked her to . Mr. Mack , with his dark eyes and lean face and the handsome look of trouble . She would walk proper and talk proper and not think about the ring of hair that needed pushing back . Her head nodded to him , and she watched him lose himself among the others . Now she 'd made up her mind , it was as if shep144could n't wait . She felt the blood tapping in her and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying I 'll come , I 'll come . I said I 'd be there , Mr. Mack . Please , I 'll come . Brownie Evans stopped her on the edge of the crowd as if she had time for him . " If you 're goin ' back to camp , maybe I better go along so 's to see you 're all right . " His boy 's face was awkward with the words , as if they came hard to him . Looking at him , of a sudden she knew how he was . She knew and was roiled by knowing and a little pleasured , too , and would have dodged around except that in his gaze she saw the naked , humble owning-up of his feeling for her . She was brushed by sadness , and she said gently , " I 'll be all right , Brownie , " and slipped into the welcoming dark , remembering , until she met Mr. Mack , how his face had lighted at her tone . " You came , " Mr. Mack said softly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand cupped itself on her elbow , guiding her away from the camp , upstream from it , where people did n't pass on their way from tents to fort and back . " Beautiful night . " She said a bare " Yes , " her throat full with beating blood and breath . " Ai n't it dangerous out here ? " " Not so close to the fort . I have a pistol besides . " They walked along and the hand on her elbow slid on her arm and found her hand , and she let him have it , feeling the fingers work against her palm and the thumb warm on her knuckles . " I guess you think I 'm a million years old , Mercy . " " No . " " I feel young , anyhow . Tonight . As young , maybe , as you . " " I do n't know nothin ' , Mr. Mack . " " Nobody does . " A tree stood black at the edge of the river , and he stopped her there and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody wants to . " The river made a murmuring by them , and a breeze joined with it , stirring the leaves of the trees . The music took up , far off , and far-off voices sounded . The distant fire was one of the big stars , burning on the ground . " Nobody wants to , " he said again and let go her hand andp145turned and brought her to him . She cried out silently while his mouth came hungry to hers . Is it right , Mr. Mack ? Is it all right ? You 're older . You know . I got a feeling it ai n't right . It ai n't right , but you said nobody knows . Her hand laid back the curl from his forehead . Ground under her , and hands seeking , older , wiser , dear hands ; and the music and the dance calls fading in the roar of blood and stars misty with the heat of breath , and pain in her like a blade and pain and pain and eager pain , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this but this but this . The stars wheeled back and burst and lit the sky with trailing fire . Afterwards she wanted nothing but to cry , nothing but to lie and cry while the night and the music and the voices came again . She felt his hand on her , urging her to sit up . " I 'm sorry , Mercy . " There was such a misery in his voice that the weight of it bowed her over . " A man 's a fool . " " Do n't you be sorry , " she whispered . " It makes it worse if I know you 're sorry . " " You 're a dear girl . " She bent her head against him , wanting gentleness , wanting comfort . " I knowed it was n't right . " " I 'm to blame . " " It 's bold to say , but it was liking for you done it . " His arm tightened on her , but he answered , " It ca n't be love , Mercy . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know . " She sat for what seemed a long time leaning against him , circling the question that lay fearsome ahead . Her voice was small with fear when she asked it . " Will anything come of it , Mr. Mack ? " He answered quick . " I do n't think so . I 'm sure it wo n't . " " Sure ? " " Sure . " " I have n't anyone to hold to but you . " " You 'll be all right . I 'm sure . " He drew his arm from around her shoulders . " We better be getting back . " " I do n't care to dance no more . " " I 'll follow along and see you 're safe to your tent then . "  | " Seems like I do n't want to do nothin ' except set here by you. , , His hand came back and lay kind on her shoulder . " We better not stay any longer . " She got up and straightened the dress with the flouncy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chest , holding to his shirt with her hands . " Mercy ! " he said , while his arms came around . " Little Mercy ! " There was misery in his voice still but also a beginning of something else again , together making a kind of wild torment that she found assurance in . " I 'm crazy . I 'm not good for you , Mercy . Say no ! Say no for your sake ! But we could see each other tomorrow night ? " There was a sort of power in the Indian drums that oppressed Brother Weatherby . The devil , he thought , watching the dancers , forever was at his wicked work , so that the beat of a stick on a dried skin became more than a measured thump and a grunted song more than a chant . They became an invitation to violence , to the dark passions , to sin . To the idolatry suggested by the dancers ' expert imitation of the buffalo . The light had n't gone from the sky yet , though the sun was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every buck and jump and headshaking of the young Indians . They had draped themselves in buffalo robes , to which the horns were still attached , and they leaped and pawed and bellowed to the rhythm of the drums . Standing back with members of his company and watchersfrom the fort , Weatherby despaired of bringing to these simple savages the wonders of the Word . He had felt better earlier , after he had held services for the Sioux in the shade of a cottonwood grove . To be sure , the place was not God 's house , where he would have been more effective and at home , supported by the close , familiar appurtenances of the ministry . Out under the vast sky , with no pulpit or Bible stand or walls around him , he felt a little like a prophet of old crying in the wilderness . Still , it had been a good meeting . The Indians , men and women , had been decorous and attentive and had listened with what he took to be interest to his prayers and  |p147exhortation  and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Night , " though , of course , they could not understand the import of his words . Dick Summers had attended , on request , to interpret the questions and answers that Weatherby anticipated . He had listened , grave as any Indian , except that , now and then , an inward smile seemed to fie in his gray eyes . A godless man was Summers , good in his way but godless , with the suggestion about him of a superior knowledge and of private reservations caused by it . Weatherby resented the suggestion  --  there was only one knowledge , and it was love of God  --  while admitting in fairness that there was nothing of the disputer or the braggart about Summers . He was companionable , kind , even overly generous , and capable as any company could wish , and Weatherby rememberedoften to thank God for sending this sinner among them . It almost seemed to him that if he could make Summers see , he would have done his work for the Kingdom of Heaven . He finished his final prayer and motioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sioux want to learn the ways of God ? Did they want to be saved ? Summers spoke in Indian gutturals , filling in with what he called sign language , and the Sioux nodded , all of them , men and women alike , and an old chief rose and spoke at length , using signs , too , standing so controlled and dignified that Weatherby would have envied him had not envy been unworthy . " What did he say , Brother Summers ? " " It 's a go . They want to learn the big medicine of the white man . " Medicine , Weatherby thought . Medicine ? For an instant he had a notion to speak out , to scold the chief for this low misunderstandingof the high and holy , and then it struck him that the chief was right . The way of God was medicine , medicinefor the suffering soul . He made an inward note to use the illustration with white congregations . " What else , Brother Summers ? " " He says they figure the Book of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against their enemies . "  | " It will save their immortal souls . Tell them that . " " Ai n't any word or sign for soul that I know of , unless it 's spirit or maybe shadow . " " No word for soul ! " Looking at the earnest , unenlightened faces , seeing the rough garments and the poor gewgaws that passed for pretties , Weatherby thought both souls and bodies were rude and graceless . He felt a sudden , overflowing sadness for these simple folk , a compassion that bent him over , a lovingkindnesssuch as God Himself must feel at sight of the wretched creatures of earth . Be long-suffering , please , 0 God , he asked . Remember , I pray Thee , they have not had opportunity to know Thee . Breathe the influence of Thy spirit on them and make them Christians . Let judgment be passed on the worldly and on the deists and the swearers , if Thou wilt , but not yet on these , Thy simple children . It filled him with a wondering love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so long-suffering with whites who had the choice of righteousness or sin and chose to drink and to blaspheme and to commit , he supposed , outrages of the flesh . Let them have their reward , he asked  --  while he studied the grave faces before him . And then he reconsideredand asked : Let me be not hasty in judgment , Lord , remembering it is for Thee in Thy love and righteous anger to dispose . Let me recall my own time of temptation and of sin and thank Thee that it has passed and Thine own spirit is strong in me . Let me do Thy work with humility and understanding . Let me be long-suffering , too . After the questions and answers the Indians had come to him solemnly , one by one , and wrung his hand , and never had he been so sure that the field was right for the tilling . Now , while the young warriors pranced and bellowed , doubt entered his mind . Grown men imitating beasts ! Others chantingto the devilish tap of the drum ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Behind him someone said , " Them Injuns are pretty goddam good at it . " A miserable business , he thought , while discouragement washed over him . With the glories of God all around , with the wonder of the night firmament coming into sight overhead ,  |p149with  death and judgment waiting , the Indians could find nothing better to do than to ape brutes , and the whites nothing better than to watch and enjoy . He had heard that the AmericanFur Company now frowned on the use of spirits in trade , but he smelled the ugly smell of whisky . The dance stopped and another one started , the dog dance this time , and Weatherby watched for a little while , only half seeing , and then turned and walked away , tightening his arm against the Bible that was his comfort and assurance . Night had fallen finally . Away from the firelighted dancing place it lay thick and soft , tempting in itself , he thought despairingly , recalling the days of his weakness . It was in God and only in God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the mark of God 's infinite wisdom that the greater the heat of blood the greater the saving and triumphant righteousness . If only he could open the blind eyes of white men and red ! He knew the way of salvation , but now , for this moment , he was depressed by the knowledge of sin and the magnitude of his task . God had called him to go afar , and he was obeying , but with the present feeling of being weak and unworthy . Let the Lord forgive him for faltering . Let the Lord give fire to his words so that the wicked could see the living light . He was thankful , as he read in the stars the proof of the divine power and omnipresence , that his God  --  that the true God  --  was not distant and unapproachable , to be propitiated by a Romanish counting of beads , to be communicated with through the dubious intermediaries that Daugherty professed to believe in . God was close and attentive , ever ready to hear the prayers of the penitent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt Him there . To Weatherby 's right , off the line of travel from camp to dance , a figure moved and stopped , almost as if to avoid the meeting , and Weatherby halted and called out , " Who is it ? " " Mack , " the figure answered , walking up . " Good evening , Brother Weatherby . " " Good evening . "  | " Been watching the dances ? " " I find them offensive . " " Does n't the Lord approve ? " " You joke about God ! " " No . I only wonder . " " Have faith . It is the answer to doubts . " " But not to living . " The words and the tone of them added to Weatherby 's depression . " We must believe that it is . " " No matter what ? " " No matter what . We can not always understand God , for His greatness is beyond understanding . " " I was taught that , back in the Methodist Church . " " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Weatherby shook his head , sorrow deep in him , and the sense of inadequacy , and irritation at this rejection of the eternal truth . " Have faith . Sorrow , difficulties , temptations  --  they are only to test us . " Mack laughed a short , mirthless laugh . " Everything bad is our fault ; everything good we owe to God . " " You talk like a deist . " " A light word for me . " Weatherby was too tired to argue , too down in spirit to answer as he should . He said , " You will come back to Methodism . I pray it will be so . " " You 'd better pray for all the train , Brother Weatherby . They tell me the country ahead swarms so with buffalo that even travel by company is risky . There 'll be Indians , too . " " I always pray for all , but I will pray especially for you . You will come back . " " Once a believer always a believer , " Mack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbeliever . Maybe you 're right . " " Good evening , Mack . " In his tent Weatherby said another prayer . " I put myself in Thy hands , 0 God . Give me the strength and wisdom to do Thy bidding , I pray Thee . Help me with the sinners and the savagesand the doubters like Brother Mack that they may see thep151greatness of Thy works and fall down and worship Thee . Let me remember that all is right that the Lord doeth . And bless our little train , I pray Thee , and see us safely on to Oregon . Amen . " Through the soft and breathing night there came to his ears the beat of drums for the dog dance. 5FORT LARAMIEtoFORT HALLosF lay : tt . FOAL , OF MILESChapter - - - - Fifteen  |p153MILLIONS  , Evans thought , a meemillion of buffalo , buffaloto right and left and ahead and behind , hairing the country , closing the train in , hoofing up dust that hung low like a fog . A man would n't live long enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he could n't parcel out the uproarthat they made . Bulls bellowed and cows bawled and calves cried for their mas , and the voices joined in what was one big , dolesome roll . Unless he looked to the Red Buttes , rising bare and naked over his left shoulder , or to the lonesome drying-up ponds with their crusting of salt , Evans could almost believe that the earth was alive , broken out of a sudden like a setting of eggs , but in humps and horns and shaggy hair . The buffalo did n't run from the train , not much , but lagged away , made mulish maybe by their numbers or sore for want of grass , and glared after the wagons , and then went hunting for graze again , for they had picked the ground clean as a chicken except for clumps of high-growing sage that gave off the smell of camphor , or turpentine , where they 'd trampled it . Evans said , " I would 've called you a liar , Dick , if you 'd told me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddle , his eyes fixed on the train that was jolting along a half mile behind . " Plenty meat , all right . " " The grass is just pinfeathers . " " Well , " Dick said , while for a minute the light played in his eyes , " you wanted huffier . " " Damnedest country ! Do n't do nothin ' by halves . Either there ai n't a buffalo or there 's nothin ' but buffalo . " " An ' wolves . " And wolves . Wolves traveling in packs like he-dogs after ap154she , bringing up the tail of the bands of buffalo , their eyes yellow and their tongues wet while they watched for a stray calf or a cripple or one too old to keep up . Off to the right a bunch of them swarmed over a cow that had mired in a salt sinkhole , feeding on her while she still tried to pull free . A couple of buzzards slanted down and slid to the ground close by . Buffalo and wolves , Evans thought , and grasshoppers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skulls lying around , picked clean as a clean platter , and , here and there where the rocks broke through , a rattlesnake looped , his tail aquiver . Evans never had thought to set his eyes on such a sight as this . It was a wild , strong sight , a rich and powerful sight that awed a man and lifted him inside  --  the plains climbing into ridges where , once in a long while , trees stood spare and tough , the sky curved across , so blue it pained the eye , far things brought close and sharp as through a glass , and buffalo on all the land and the roll of their bellowings in all the air . Again he felt greatness , smallness and greatness both among such wild riches . And , seeing the train winding behind him , he thought with pride of it , of the onwardness of its people , of their stubborn , unthought-out yondering . It was n't a thing for reason , this yondering , but for the heart , where secrets lay deep and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? All together they were n't enough . In the beginning , that is , they were n't enough , but as a man went on it came to him how wide and wealthy was his country , and the pride he had talked about at first became so real he lost the words for it . It was good , he thought , that they 'd laid by two days at Laramie and fixed wagons and traded teams and bought supplies , though the trading was one-sided and the food high as a scared cat 's back . Flour at forty dollars a barrel , and not so damn superfine at that ! Still , they were better off , even mangy Hank McBee , whom Mack had trusted for the price of coffee and sugar and flour and the boot it took to make a trade of teams . Evans liked Mack for being generous , but still he knew he was foolish . The money was as good as lost . The train was a top train now , victualed and repaired and leaned down for travel . Stoves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grindstones and pieces of furniture , thrown out as the wagons climbed the thick-dusted ridges or circled gullies cut by heavy water . This , Dick had said as if not saying much , was the roughest part of the trail east of the great pass . The train was better ordered other ways , more regular about time and the round of work , more knowing about stock . Wiser , too . Like with rifles . The men carried them loaded still , but not capped or primed , not since Botter by accident had shot a hole in Hig 's pants and plowed a furrow in him . Hig had taken it good-natured , telling the men he could spare something behind but not a bit in front . Afterwards Evans had asked that the caps be left off and the priming undone until the need came , and everybody said it was a good idea , seeing as accidents could happen . Even Indians did n't affright the people too much any more , or find them unprepared . Out from Laramie they 'd met a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company had rounded brisk into a fort while Dick went on to make palaver . A little tobacco and some beads and a red shirt and powder and ball had fixed things up , though afterwards the women got uneasy because squaws and their broods and some of the bucks kept peeking under the wagon covers , wanting to see and to finger the white plunder . Some of it they stole  --  a few knives and Davisworth 's ax and an old rifle that belonged to Shields . Dick said any train would lose that much . Evans did n't take to himself much of the credit for the betterment , knowing the people would have learned no matter who was captain , but still he felt good about it , and pleased because the general spirit seemed so stout . Even Tadlock had got some of his brashness back , acting at the fort almost too much like his old self . Dick broke into Evans ' thought , saying , " Fixin ' to storm , west . " Not till then had Evans paid any mind to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That the way storms come from here ? " " Ca n't always tell . They used to say at Laramie that an east wind brought rain . "  |p157In  the silence that followed , Evans was aware again of the long bawling of the buffalo . " It ai n't so far to good-enough water , if I remember right . " " Meanin ' we ought to camp early ? " " I seen huffier thisaway clear to Laramie and to hell and gone beyond . " " You do n't like it , Dick ? " " Puts me in mind of old times . " " But you do n't like it ? " " One winter on the Powder the huffier was so thick we had to build fires to keep ' em off from camp . Lucky , I 'm thinking , they did n't take it into their heads to run . " " I get it . It 's come to my mind , too , but mostly I been thin kin ' about no grass and Indians bound to be about somewhereswith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a buffler stampede , Lije . " No , Evans thought , with the pinch of fear in him now that Dick had put words to what had been just a stray flutter . He never had seen a stampede , but with a storm making up and the levels and slopes dark with animals he could imagine it . He could feel himself waking at night to thunder in the ground . In his mind he could leap up , terror in him and the thought of Rebecca and Brownie and the rest , and he helpless as in a bad dream while the thunder rolled up and he saw the first low-held heads and the pounding feet of it before it ran them over . " I do n't like the notion of it . " " But for the women and young'uns I would n't think anythingof it , " Dick said . " Would n't they shy off even from a train ? " Dick waggled his head , not saying yes and not saying no , while he squinted to the west where the sun was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Cows look all right , and the horses . " " Funny about them buffalo calves , " Evans said , speaking what was second in his thoughts . " You would n't think they 'd j'in up with us and foller tame cows . " " Sometimes . Like I said , what you got to watch for is your own critters do n't chase off with the buffler. "  | " I got every man we can spare back there . Reckon I ought to be back myself , ' stead of scoutin ' with you . " " If we got salt enough , we could salt tonight to keep the cattle close . " " Do n't know as that would do it , they 're so ganted up . Anyhow , looks like they 'd get enough of this wild salt , the way it 's patched around . " " Pizens ' em . You know that . " They did n't say more until they came to what the sun had left of a lake , each thinking the same thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the west cloud swelling slow . The lake was just a skim of water , ringed wide around by the white crust , in which some old bones were half sunk . Dick got off his horse , anyhow , and crunched through the salt and dipped a finger in and tasted it and shook his head . " Pure pizen . " " We 'd best put out a flag then so 's the train do n't come too close , " Evans said . " Them thirsty critters might make a break . " They rode out from the water and tied a rag to a high clump of sage and watched to see that the lead teamster took notice . " I figured that lake was no good , but still maybe good enough in a pinch , " Dick told Evans then . " Was n't any wood for fires even so . Lake that wo n't grow anything but sage and greasewood , an ' no willows or cotton trees , is always bad water . " They rode for an hour longer , pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as a farmer might push his pastured stock . There was no end to them , just no by-God end to them , no end to cows and calves and fighting bulls and dust that gritted in the teeth and noise that tired the ear . Once Evans asked , " What 's this place we 're headed to ? " Dick answered , " Hell , Lije , I do ' know . The mountain men did n't put names to ought but beaver streams and the Tetons and a hole or two . " Evans shut his mouth , deciding Dick did n't want to talk , and watched the cloud ahead . It was full and ugly , but it seemed to have held up , as if uncertain where to go . While he looked , a bolt of lightning tore it . Dick rose in his stirrups and pointed . " I 'm thinkin ' that 's it . "  |p158Through  the dust , beyond a white sinkhole , over the backs of buffalo , Evans could make out a winding fringe of growth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seen now and soon to be camped by and soon after left behind , if they were lucky ; a place like dozens of others  --  campsites and crossings and hills and hollows  --  all the way back to Independence . It was hard for him to put them in order , hard even to remember where they had camped night before last and the night before that . The spots were lost in a stream of days that stretched back to forever . They were scrambled in the miles , mixed on the long plain of the Platte , confused in the hills west of Laramie . Kaw , Big Blue , Little Blue , Platte , Ash Hollow , Courthouse Rock , Horse Creek , Laramie , Big Spring , Deer Creek , North Platte crossing  --  and what were the places in between ? Scott 's Bluffs , Brady 's Island , the iVakarusa where , a lifetime ago , he already had the feeling he was getting far from home . The no-name points , the nameless miles along the river , the cut where an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could dig them out of memory , one and then another , but what filled this back part of his mind was the day-after-day roll of wheels , the dust , the heat and wind and rain and mud and chill , and the Turleys turning back and Martin crying for grace . His life beforeseemed like another life . All he ever had done was poke a team or explore the trail or push cattle along . The only way he ever faced was west . And it was good . It was all fine and dandy , except that uneasinesslay on him now . A few buffalo stood in the spring water or around it , stragglersfrom the bands that had come to drink and cool off and had cropped the banks down to the quick and now were moving off , on the hunt for grass . If bawling would find it , or pawing , they 'd have full bellies before morning . Dick let go of his looped reins and looked to the cap on the nipple of his rifle . " Might as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He rode slowly , giving Evans time to cap his own gun , then kicked his horse into a gallop . The buffalo stood quiet for a minute , dim-witted and waiting , and turned and broke into their clumsy run , the ones in the  |p159water  wrenching out of it and getting away last . Dick broke his cow down not ten yards from the spring . Evans was slower , but his shot was good . The cow hunched up as if drawn together from the middle and tried to get lined out again and fell on her side kicking . They had hardly fallen before a couple of wolves showed up , winking hungry from over a little rise . Evans bled the cows , and he and Dick stepped back to have a look at the spring , trailing their horses after them . Dick set to work charging his rifle , watching the wolves meantime to see they did n't make bold with the meat . The herds of buffalo coming and going had churned the water and so fouled it that Evans said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It 's wet . " " Might as well drink from a cow . " " It 'll clear some . There 's a fair amount of water runnin ' . " " I bet it 'll grow hair on a man , if it do n't kill him . " " Shoo , " Dick said , sliding his wiping stick in place , " I drunkout of wallows so thick they would n't pour . " " I ai n't sayin ' you ai n't right , but it pret ' near makes me wish we 'd took the left-hand road by the river . " " Same thing there . With such a galore of huffier about you ca n't get away from mud and sand and huffier doin 's . This here 's sweet water . There 's no pizen in a huffier , Lije . " Dick studied the lay of the land , so 's to know how to draw his circle , and as the train came up he mounted his horse and led the lead wagon around , ending up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stepped back by the cows so the wolves would n't come to them . It would be a broody night , he thought , black and broody , sounding to wolf howls and buffalo bawls if to nothing more . The sun was sliding into the swollen edge of cloud , making a dark fire there . Dick came up , saying , " I got help with the butchering , " and Evans nodded and led his horse to where his own teams had stopped and tied it to a wheel . He said , " Howya , boy ? " to Brownie . Before and behind him , and all around the circle , people were busy with their oxen , some of the women andp160older children doing the unhitching since so many of the men were bringing up the loose stock . It struck Evans that this was an uncommonly quiet camp , sobered , as he was himself , by the sense of being lost in distance , by the red light on the land and by the brutes about . " Where 's Rock ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little and so I boosted him into the wagon , " Brownie answered . Rebecca got down stiff from her perch in the second wagon . " I declare , Lije , such a sight of critters ! " Brownie said , " I had to laugh . Ma was scared to walk . " " Not afeard exactly , " she answered , " but offish . I 'll allow to being offish , And , besides , this here wild salt eats your shoes away . " She breathed deep , easier now , Evans knew with the pride that would n't stand words , because she stood by him again . " I do n't never hope to get rid of that bull-roarin ' in my ears . " " I got so I do n't notice it , hardly , " Evans said while he went to unhitching . " So ! You do n't hear it now , I reckon ? " " Not with people talkin ' so much , " he answered , and looked up and winked at her . He worked fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the push of coming darkness and the weight of the cloud at his back . " You water ' em , " he said to Brownie , " and take ' em out to graze . That way looks best . " He motioned with his thumb . " Come about dark , we 'll put as many oxen in with the horses as the corral will hold . We 'll forgit about milkin ' . Cow does n't give but a cupful , anyhow . " " I 'll take the horse , Pa , " Brownie said and untied and got on , driving the three teams before him . " You 're anxious , Lije . " Rebecca did n't put the words as a question . " Just a mite . I 'll be back in a shake . " He left her and made the rounds of the wagons , talking to what men he saw . Hobble every horse before turning them out for their hour or so of grazing ! Keep the best oxen close , to shove in the corral with the horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . Thenp161come and cut wood for fires ! Buffalo might run . The men nodded , not questioning him , though the thought came to him , and was pushed away , that he spoke like Tadlock . The horse herd came up in a bunch and narrowed into a line and flowed into the corral through the gap left for them . He told the drivers what he had told the rest . " Botter , ask the cow guards to take ' em south , but not too far . We 'll herd separate from the oxen . " He sized up the meanderings of the flow from the spring . " There 'll be enough water there , I reckon . " The directions given , he went back and gathered some loose wood and struck fire for Rebecca , and then took his ax and made for the brush , where other men joined him when they 'd tended to their animals . They spread out along the fringe that followed the water , pulling out what dead wood there was and chopping up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evans . " Hell of a storm makin ' up , " he said , resting for a minute on his ax . Coming out of the dark face , the words seemed dark . " Maybe not . That cloud ai n't hardly moved for an hour or more . " " No wood to speak of . The green stuff do n't burn for nothin ' . " Holdridge went back to swinging his ax . Together they had quite a little pile pitched up when Dick came by , a smear of blood on his buckskins from the butchering . Evans thought Dick probably had skinned out the buffaloes ; he always said the hides might come in handy later . " I figured to set fires north , south , east and west , not a quarter of a mile out , " Evans said . Dick scuffed his jaw with his knuckles . " All right . " " Seems so . " " Which way are they like to run , Dick ? " " No tellin ' . Maybe north . They 're driftin' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond where I figured to put the fire . " " Do n't know as it makes any difference . No matter where they 're at , they 'll likely run if the buffler do . " " We 'll set the biggest fire south then . And if we got time ,  |p162we  'll cut some sage , I thought , so 's to be sure this wood catches good enough . " " Need a wagon for haulin ' , " Holdridge put in . " I got one as has some room in it with the cook stuff out . " " Find a team then and bring it on . " Dick said , " I 'll see can I beg some salt . " Evans began chopping again . When Holdridge came up with the wagon , Evans helped load it and went to the next pile and helped with it and afterwards led the way , showing where the fires would be . They cut sage at each place , and at each one Evans put a man in charge , taking the south post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' take rifles . Shootin ' might turn ' em if they run . " He studied the sky and the land lying red under it and the herds still to be made out from the light of long streamersslanting above the cloud . " I do n't guess you need to fire up yet . We got time to eat . " Evans went to his wagon , joining Dick there for the supper Rebecca had ready . " Brownie et ? " he asked . " Come in and gobbled a mouthful and went back to the cattle . That boy works too hard , Lije . " " No helpin ' it tonight . Everybody works . I got to get out there and tell the guards not to stick if the buffalo start runnin ' . We 'll set the tent later . " He put his plate aside and got up , telling himself he 'd best get more powder and ball while he thought of it , and also the Colt 's six-shoot pistol that he never had bothered to carry . It was loaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I raised some salt here and there . " He sat cross-legged on the ground near the pot . " Not that I know it 'll do any good . " As he spoke , a little gust of wind worried at them . " That wind ! " Rebecca passed biscuits she 'd cooked in the Dutch oven . Evans knew it was n't the wind she was thinking of , but of the storm maybe a-coming and such a sea of buffalo around and Brownie out with the cattle . Still , he could n't baby Brownie . Brownie was a grown man , almost , and as a man had to take his chances with the rest . The gust whipped at them again , and Dick said , with the look in his face of expecting something , " She 's comin ' , Lije. "  |p163Evans  got up , a sudden anxiety on him . " I 'll round up the men . " The wind took the words from his mouth . Mixed with the whine of it he could hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now close . The red light still lay on the land , grown to a kind of dark fire like that shed by a camp blaze . A bolt of lightning jagged down the western sky , and thunder rumbled . He saw as he passed a curve of the circle that Weatherby was holding services , though not a handful listened . Some of the words came to him . " Let us put our trust in God . He rules the earth and the seas and the mountains and the savage tribes and the wild beasts and the storms . . . " Patch ! Brewer ! Tadlock ! Insko ! All of you ! To the fires ! " Of a sudden the world was all wind , all fierce and driving wind that choked the words back and scoured his throat with sand . " Mack ! Gorham ! " The cloud reared up , closing off the dark fire , and let loose a bolt that stunned the eye . In the dark that followed it , all Evans could see was a stream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't know when it was he had begun to run . " Patch ! Come on ! " He ran south , feeling his shot pouch beat on his middle and his pistol bulky in his belt . A small rain drilled at the side of his face , and lightning blinded him again and thunder boxed his ears . He grabbed wood from the pile , and sage , and shielded it with his body and poured powder out and reached for flint and steel , until he felt someone at his side and , in the glare of a bolt , saw that it was Patch stooping with his firemaker . The powder flashed and went out . Patch pulled a rag from his pocket and rubbed a hand of powder in it and tried the spark again . The fire started slow , nibbling at the edges of sage while the wind tried to tear it away , but at last it was going , blowing low to the east . " Keep feedin ' it ! I got to see the herders . " Evans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the wind that tried to slant him off , crying to himself , " Come on , Brownie ! " as if the wish could reach him . He ought to have had sense enough to bring a saddle horse ,  |p164he  told himself , and then the night exploded . Lightning tore the sky and broke the earth and left after its crack and boom a sudden , breathy silence in which he thought he heard the thin howling of wolves . He thought he heard it and then it went from his mind , for under it , under the high whine of the wind , another sound came on , deep like a far drum . He slowed . He had to tell himself this was it , this was a million buffalo gone crazy , the pound of their hoofs beginning to shake the world so that not even thunder sounded . He ran again , crying , " Brownie ! " into the wind , into the swelling drum of hoofs , crying , " Guards ! Run ! " Closer , he heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw the cattle sweeping to him , pushed , he took it , by the buffalo beyond . He stumbled ahead and fell and drew himself up and fired into the black memory of them , hearing the poor pop of the rifle , seeing the little fire jet from the muzzle . The end had come , the end to Brownie and Rebecca and all his good knowing of them , but he ran on , tearing the pistol from his belt and firing while he ran until there was nothing to do but wait for the charging heads and the outflung hoofs and the long trample over him . No need to run for the fire . No time to reload . Stand straight and go down and call it quits . Hurrah for Oregon ! Noise drowned out thought and feeling . The swell and beat of it drowned them . There was no feeling but noise , thunder shaking out of the earth , rolling to the shaken land , unseen and awful thunder , all the brutes of God gone mad while God hid beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the camphor smell of broken sage . He felt the first beasts pounding by . He could make out the black blur of their flight . He breathed the breath of them and knew their heat and waited , all of him caught up and held in the moment . Lightning flashed again . He saw the cattle heaving by on his right and the humped buffalo hard on their heels , hump beyond hump to the end of sight , and he thought without feeling that the stampede might miss the corral . He knew he had a chance now . He might make it back to the  |p165fire  . But he stood still , he did n't know for how long , fronting up to his time , if this was it , while his body shook to the shake of the world and the face of Brownie kept forming in his mind . After a while he realized it was all over . The drag of the herd had beaten by and was gone and the drum of feet was drawing off , and the wind had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him he saw Patch 's fire and back of it the fires of camp . Feeling flooded back on him then , relief and misery both , so that his voice broke as he ran , " Brownie ! You there , Brownie ? " No one answered . He heard Patch call to him , but he ran on , tripping on the battered sage and calling out . A hump would show him , a hump that had been a horse , or a flat , thin shadow . " You here , Brownie ? " He did n't know Patch was with him until Patch took him by the arm . " Better come on , Evans . If he is n't at camp , we 'll get all the men out . " He pulled away , resentful and afraid to speak , and Patch came to him again , gently , saying , " He may be at camp , you know . " Evans let himself be led , noticing but hardly noticing the rain and the lightning flashing fitful to the east , thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the muddy ground , sounded ahead . Patch called out , " Who is it ? " " That you , Patch ! " It was Dick 's voice . " Right . " " Seen Evans ? " " He 's here . " " Pa ! Are you all right , Pa ? " The young voice sounding in the night , the boy 's face with a boy 's high hopefulness , the voice bending him down , bursting his chest . " All right . I was afeard for you , Son . " " I told Ma you 'd make out . Dick come and stayed with us herders , and when the storm broke , and the stampede , we rode wild as could be . I swear , it was fun . " The letdown from worry left Evans suddenly tired and sore . He said , " Fun , was it ! " So it was Dick again , Dick always Johnny-on-the-spot while he himself was stumbling around inp166the dark like a fool . A man would think Dick could n't make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been for Evans that herd would have overrun the train . He ran out into it , firing . " " You can always count on Lije , " Dick said . Evans found only a grunt for that , while the notion came and grew in him that he ought to apologize for words thought if not said . A right man could n't prize Dick enough . " Take us half a day , at the least , to gather up them cattle , " Dick went on , " and then like as not we wo n't find ' em all . " Chapter Sixteenp167JUDITH FAIRMAN straightened slowly and pressed her twohands at her sides , easing the ache in her back . " Toddie , you stay close . " She sighed while she looked up at IndependenceRock where some of the men were climbing , huntinggood places to chisel their names . Washing was a hard chore , even on a balmy day on the bank of a good stream . And riding and walking were hard , and mornings were hard , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a feeling of discomfort and distention that sometimes at night brought her bolt upright in bed . She would belch then , from deep in her , and Charles would stir and ask , " You all right , Judie ? " and she would sink back , relieved but burdened by the unloveliness of the act while she reassured him . She was n't the only one , and she found courage in that . There was Mrs. Brewer , who accepted her condition as she might have accepted the coming of a season , and Mrs. Patch , who had n't much to say , and Mrs. Byrd , who made a kind of meek to-do , hoping again and again that she 'd have a roof over her head and a decent place to lie when her time came . Maybe there were others , keeping the secret in them along with the seed . If there were n't , how did they manage ? Mrs. Mack , for instance , with her wide-set , green eyes and her good shape ? The question came and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxation and play for all except the women . The men and boys climbed the rock , and children romped , and even the oxen , lying in the eastward bottom , had a chance to rest i heir feet . Charles had ridden out with Dick Summers and Lije Evans . They would make a scout , they said , and bring in meat , returning in plenty of time for the Fourth of July oration that ' Padlock was to deliver , prematurely , for today was the first . Work or no , she welcomed this one day in camp . What did it really matter , except in men 's imaginations , if the backwardp168trains caught up ? What did it matter if they passed , as one  --  the first so far  --  had done today ? It was a little company with little stock that overtook them and waved and shouted and went on , too bent on leadership to waste time with a visit . Their captain informed Evans , though , that four of his command had died . Well , let them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager miles between them and the graves behind . Standing while the pain in her back lessened , Judith thought that the whole train needed a rest , even though it had made poor time since the crossing of the Platte . One whole day and part of another had been given to a hunt for the cattle that the stampede had scattered . Most of the men , delegated by Evans , had ridden hard while the rest watched camp and fiddled with repairs and chafed at inaction and wished that the sun would go down , for it cast a breathless heat . The women had cooked and sewed and longed for a patch of shade and clean , cold water and had acted fretfully with the fretful children hanging to their skirts . The riders found parts of the herd here and parts of it there and came trailing them in , one after another , sitting their saddles as if too cramped to change positions , their hats pulled low over burned faces . Some of the cattle had mired in the sinkholes and some had crippled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three of the twenty left behind had belonged to Charles . " Do n't get too close to the water , Toddie . " Yes , she said to herself , the sight of idleness was good , though she was not a part of it  --  the wagons halted tongue to tail along the green banks of the Sweetwater , the casual breeze stirringthe loosened covers , the cattle and horses farther out under the lazy guard of men who had dismounted and sat half recliningin the grass , letting ground and breeze renew them ; and westward the rock , the bald , gray lift of rock waiting the ages out . Cool water . Shade . Rest . Only around her , only here where the women worked was there the purposeful fret of living . Only here were the little , draining businesses of rubbing and scuffing and wringing out and hanging on a line . Did the other women feel the load of things , the day-by-day doing of chores that would just have to be done again ? Mrs. Tadlock ? Mrs. Daugh/erty ? Mrs. Gorham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with wet , red hands that the dry air would chap worse still ? Did they feel the load ? And , beyond it , did they share the dark disquietthat afflicted her , the wordless apprehension that made all troubles big ? She knew she was feeling sorry for herself , but for the moment she did n't care . She bent over and soaped a shirt and beganrubbing it on the board that slanted from the tub and asked Tod again to stay close to her . Charles had set blocks under the tub , but still she had to stoop and , stooping , bring back the ache in her back . Underclothes , shirts , Tod 's things , dresses , a pair of woolen breeches she felt sure would shrink despite all pains . Wash them and wear them and wash again , week on week to Oregon , to the end of life . For a little while she let herself think she suffered more than others because her life had been gentler . She knew what it was to have black help , to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her hands . A tear slid from her eye and fell on the washboardand disappeared in suds . She pinched other tears off , impatient with herself and touched by guilt . Work was work for anybody , and she always had worked if not at such long drudgery . She always wanted to work ; it was just that she was tired now and filled with forebodings . " Tod , please do n't wander off . Come back . Mother 's busy . " He lifted his face to hers , his eyes light blue like her own , his cheeks and mouth still marked by babyhood . " Ca n't I wade , Mother ? " " Afterwhile . You stay close now . " While she spoke to him , Rebecca Evans came from the line she had strung . " I got my things all done , " she said . " Lemme help you . You look tuckered . " Her strong hands went to work with the rinsing and wringing . It occurred to Judith that she was the type of woman for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unafraid . If ever a cloud hung over her , no one knew it . If ever the thought of miles depressed her , she did n't let on . Miles . Distance . Distance was the enemy , not Indians orp170crossings or weather or thirst or plains or mountains , but distance , the empty , awesome face of distance , the miles on wrinkledmiles of it , the levels and hills and hollows and bluffs , unconquerable by the slow turn of wheels or the creaking step of oxen . There was no end to it , not even any shortening . Morningand night it was there unchanged , hill and cloud and sky line beyond reach or reckoning . Sometimes she wondered at the stubborn , crazy courage of men who thought that day on day would add to Oregon . " It seems so far , " she said to Rebecca . " Do n't it , though ? " Rebecca tossed a twist of clothes into a basket . " Tell you what helps , though . Do n't think how far . Just think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of underwear at a time , and one shirt ? " " I declare , Judie , you are wore out ! " Judith felt the quick , inner spasm of tears and wrestled it down , ashamed but close to crying still at this excitement of self-pity . She turned her face away , to Toddie who was punchingat the ground with a stick . " I wish I was more like you , Rebecca . " " Like me ? " " Things do n't seem to bother you . " " An ' I never feel broke down or sad or anything ? " " Do you ? " " Sometimes I walk on my lip , it 's drawed so low . " " No one would know . " Rebecca 's breath came out in a little explosion . " Do n't ever think that what you feel ai n't felt by all at one time or another . I get down in my mind , and then I think I got a good boy and a good man , and I ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself , Judie . " Judith agreed by nodding . A kind and thoughtful man , Charles was , earnest and well intentioned if not forceful even in the quiet way in which Lije Evans was forceful . Give him time , she thought , give him Evans ' years , and he might be so . " I do n't know why I get so gloomy . " " Same with all of us , more or less , " Rebecca answered while she kept busy with her hands . " Less with me , now . I 'm prettyp171perky mostly . Course , with you it 's different . Maybe a woman 's got to feel sick and low and go through birthin ' so 's to set a proper store by her baby . " " Maybe . " " A woman ai n't cut like a man , not so adventuresome or rangin ' and likin ' more to stay put  --  but still we foller ' em around , and glad to do it , too . " Rebecca laughed a throaty , halfruefullaugh as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought Judith , more masculine than most women . She had a broad face , like her husband , and the suggestion of a mustache on her sun-darkened lip . Rebecca went on , " Your boy there 's chipper as a squirrel . " " We think he 's cured of the fever . " She ought to be overjoyedat that . She ought to be singing thanks to this high , raw country and the sharp smell of sage that Dick Summers said was medicine itself . She ought to be happy at the tanned glow of health in the delicate , still-baby face bent now to the ground and the stick that stirred it . But old misgivings rode her , the weeks-long sense of overhanging misfortune . In her was the heavy impulse to retreat , to flee to the plantation in Kentucky , to go to her mother , who lived graciously in Lexington , to visit her sister , safe and happy at Vicksburg . She hoped the letters she had written and left at Fort Laramie to be carried by the first eastbound travelers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , " Rebecca said . " He 's in good case all right . " Tod lifted his head . " Ca n't I go and play with the other children , Mother ? They 're all playing . " So they were . One group was down the river , splashing in the shallows , only half watched by their elders . Another kept streaming around and out from the corral , frisky , like pups , at release from the grind of travel , the young voices raised in shouts and screams and laughter . But still Judith said , " We 'll go wading soon . " " I want to play now . " " I know , Son . It does get tiresome . " Rebecca 's face asked why she did n't let him run along . " I 'm too careful , I guess , " she answered , " but he was so sick.  |p172So  sick . So long . " To Tod she said , " How about mud pies ? " " I 'm tired of nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked again , thinking how time bore on a child , remembering from her girlhood how long an hour could be . She put herself in his place , imagining the nevernever-endingroll of wheels , the hot sun unmoving in the blank sky , the slow and deadly daily round , and all the bursting energies pent up , confined to fidgets and complainings . How much farther to the Southern Pass , Mother ? How long before we stop ? How far is it now to Oregon ? Nothing to do . Nothing to do except to wait on time that would n't pass . And now , when he could play , she feared unreasonably for him to leave her side . " I 'll get the water , Toddie . " She took her hands from the tub and picked up a piggin and walked to the stream and filled it and brought it to him . " You 'll have fun , playing mud pies . I 'm almost through . " She bent to kiss the small , protesting face . They finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to Rebecca , " That was a big help . You go now . " " Things 'll be all right with you . We 'll get to the Willamette long before your time . " " I 'm not worried about that . It 's just  --  I do n't know  --  I 'm just foolish . " " What comes usually ai n't near so bad as feared . You remember that . " Rebecca smiled and flicked the water from her hands and went to gather up her things , walking straight and sure and strong . The other women were dumping tubs and collecting the tools of their work and one by one trailing back toward their tents . Judith was lifting the basket when Hig came by . He said , " Mornin ' , " and let his lean limbs down by Toddie , favoring the wound that Botter 's accidental shot had made . " How you , boy ? " " Mother wo n't let me play . " " Why sure , now , she will . Me and you 'll build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Judith set the basket down , wanting the dry , queer cheer of Hig . " I thought you 'd be on the rock . " " Fer what ? "  | " To carve your name , of course . " " Not me , " he answered , breaking the branch and setting the sticks while Tod looked on . " Why ? " He grinned . " I could say I do n't know writin ' . " " Oh . " " But that ai n't it . " " What is it ? " Thought lighted his narrowed eyes . " This here country puts its mark on a man , and the mark is that he ai n't sure who he is , being littled by the size of it . " " I do n't see  --  " " So he puts his mark on the country , like they 're doin ' on that rock , and then he can say to hisself , By Godfrey , this is me , all right . There 's my name writ right there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shoo , boy , we forgot to leave us a gate . " Then , " What I 'm tryin ' to tell your ma is I 'm too simple-minded fer it . I would n't any more'n cut my name than I 'd wonder was it really me that cut it and , besides , was that sure enough my name anyhow . " " I thought they cut them for other people to see . " " Men puts me in mind of a horse that lined us today . Been lost , I reckon , from a train last year , and wanderin ' over this God-big country ever since , wonderin ' about hisself , thinkin ' was he a horse sure enough , an ' if so just what horse was he , Shorty or Pete or Blue or what . Or was he just a stray thought blowed by the wind ? When he seen us , he really cut a caper . You never seen a horse so glad , an ' all just because he could kind of put hisself together again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside to keep the Injuns off . " " Do n't they write their names for other people to see ? " " People as knows me knows my name , an ' them as don'tdo n't keer , or maybe would be tormented tryin ' to place me . " " You think funny things , Hig . " " Who do n't , ma'am ? " Who did n't ? Was this long uneasiness of hers any odder , was it as sensible as Hig 's whimsies ? " Anyhow , we 're glad you 're with us , Hig. "  | " Same here . Now , Tod , there 's a dandy fort for you . Keep them redskins scared away . Hear ? I got a job of tire fixin ' to do . " He drew his long legs under him and got to his feet and ambled off , a scarecrow , Judith thought , a scarecrow with a mind . She picked up the basket . " You play fort , Tod , while I finish , and then we can wade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two trees and put the basket down and began shaking out and hanging up the wash . A scarecrow with a mind . A personality behind a face like a forgotten apple . And more than that . A spirit that kept itself good-natured and whimsical , that found fun in a fiddle and rewards in the moment , undaunted by hardship or travel or distance or the dark disasters the brooding mind made up . She would be more like that , she told herself . She would cast off anxiety . She would meet trouble when it came , and not before . She would be cheerful and strong and so make a better wife and mother . She made herself hum a snatch of song and felt a kind of fierce cheer and a kind of fierce strength rising in her , put there by her will . She let herself enjoy it , let herself exult with it while she hung the clothes , her mind passive , knowing only the high comfort of courage . She hung the last garment and turned to speak , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run away . He just meant to move around a little , being so tired of forts and mud pies and staying in one place that he could n't hold still any longer . He walked out from the washtub , stepping through a patch of dry grass , and a great , gray grasshopper with blind eyes looked at him and jumped up with a flutter of red wings and a whirring clatter . He ran after it , watching its crazy flight in the breeze , and saw it settle . He came up with his hand lifted and cupped , a little fearful of clapping it down . The eyes stared and the legs hitched and the stone-gray body rose , turning red again , and clattered ahead . He stooped and grabbed two finger stones , thinking he would kill the grasshopper with them , and set off after it , running toward a grass clump where it had lighted . It winged up just asp175he thought he had lost it , and he ran again , holding a rock in each hand . He threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it rose and he followed , hot and eager with the chase of it . After a while he did lose it . It would n't rise from the dust or the curled grass where he thought it had landed though he scuffed the place and scuffed it again , feeling let down because fun should have been taken from him so soon . Giving up , he looked around and saw that Mother was out of sight , over a swell of land , beyond a wagon itself half hidden by the swell . He could n't see any person , not a man or a woman , and not even any children , though their shouting voices came to him . A sudden emptiness came on him , and he started trotting back , wanting the safe arms of his mother and the soft bosom and the mouth scolding while it kissed him . Then he heard the grasshopper again , the nervous , whirring rattle of it coming from somewhere in a ragged pile of rocks . The known sound reassured him . He stopped trotting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , hard to see against the broken stone , among the sun-browned grasses , a little-man 's face looked at him , pinch-mouthed and hard-eyed , with two holes for a nose . A tongue licked red and quick from the tight mouth . Little-man 's face ! Snake 's face ! Rattlesnake 's face , the coil behindshowing dusty on the dusty rock , the tail blurred with shaking ! In the shock of first knowing , he could n't run . He stood there with fear washing in him while his eyes blurred with the blurringtail and lost the face in the fast , red licking of the tongue . " Toddie ! Oh , Toddie ! " He swung around and started off and felt the bite of needles in his leg and the drag of the coil before it pulled free . Lije Evans pulled up when he and the others had rounded Independence Rock and could get a good view of the camp . " There she is , safe as sassafras . " Dick Summers and Charles Fairman had reined in , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain to the covered wagons a half mile away . Back of them the four meatladenpack horses nosed up and melted into the positions of rest . " We got a fair load on them critters , " Evans said , sizing up the two that trailed him . " We been fools for luck  --  so far . " Fairman asked , " What do you mean , Dick ? So little sickness ? " " Injuns . We ai n't hardly seed an Injun . " " Plenty of time yet , " Evans said . " Acrost the mountains is friendlies . " " But no buffalo . " " Few . Ought to dry meat tomorrow or next day , Lije , I 'm thinkin ' . Seemed today like the buffler 'd run out soon now . " While he spoke , Dick kept his gaze on the camp . Evans glanced at it and then up at the sun and said , " We come back in good time to hear Tadlock on independence , like we promised . " Thinking about Tadlock , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ought to have a Fourth of July speech at the rock and then had acted as if he did n't want to make it when they asked him why he did n't speak himself then . Said that was n't the idea , but all right , then , he would , since they asked . He was a man so hungry for importance he kept chasing it away . Tadlock went out of Evans ' mind when he glanced at Dick again . " What 's wrong ? " He followed Dick 's gaze to the camp . The wagons sat safe in the sun and around them the tents ; eastwardthe herd straggled along the river , where he could make out a guard or two . " Maybe nothin ' , " Dick answered . " Do n't see nobody this side of the corral . " " They 're by the river . " Dick grunted , and Evans found himself wondering , as he had before , at the way of Dick , who could look off and see things that others would n't and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " There 's doin 's on yonder side . " Squinting , Evans now and then caught sight of figures through the gaps that the cluster of tents and wagons left . " Probably Weatherby 's exhortin ' . "  | " Could be . " " My wagons are over there . " The shadow of misgiving showed on Fairman 's face . " Let 's git on , " Dick said , and jerked the lead rope on his two-horse pack string . Evans jerked , too , and kicked his mount and felt his right arm strain at the socket as the near horse pulled back . He reckoned he 'd never learn to handle a rope and a rifle and reins as Dick could . " Getup ! " The horses came to a trot and then to a slow lope , the meat thunking against their sides as they hit the end of stride . Fairman , without a pack string to pull , had gone galloping ahead . Dick was right , Evans thought , as they pulled to a stop on the near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and untied . There was n't a soul here . Everybody was yonder . They slid off and tied up to wheel spokes and stepped over a wagon tongue and crossed the enclosure now empty of stock and stepped over another tongue and came to the company grouped outside Fairman 's tent . Evans grabbed the first man he came to . It happened to be Hig . " What is it ? " Hig 's squeezed face seemed squeezed more than ever . The words came thin from his mouth . " The boy got snake-bit . " " Tod ! " " Rattlesnake-bit . " " For God 's sake ! When ? " " Been a spell back . Middle of the morning . " " Dick ! " Hig 's voice was n't much more than a whisper . " Looks like a goner . " " Dick ! You hear ! " " I heerd , " Dick said and shook his head . They pushed on to the flap of the tent where Brother Weatherbystood old and stooped . Evans brushed by him and bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rebecca first , sitting on the ground by the side of the bed , a pan in her hand . She did n't speak , except with her eyes . Evans said , " I  --  we just heerd. "  |p178The  boy lay in his bed on the ground , covered so that nothing could be seen of him except his shape under the blanket and , at the head of the bed , his face pale on the fresh pillow and his eyes half closed . Evans ' gaze ran from the boy to Judith Fairman , who sat across from Rebecca , holding the boy 's hand in both of hers . " How is he ? " Fairman swung around . He had been kneeling by his wife 's side , staring at Tod as if a spell had been put on him . " In the name of God , do we just have to stand and gawk ? " The boy stirred weakly and murmured something that his mother bent to hear . She took a towel from a little pile by her side and touched his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another drink , Toddie ? Want another drink ? " Evans called , " Dick ! " Dick had stayed just outside . He crowded into the tent and nodded and rested his eyes on the bed . " We 'd best look , too , Charlie , " Evans said . " He was cold . He told his mother he was cold , " Fairman said , low-voiced , as if asking pardon for being impolite before . He laid back the cover , watching their faces while they looked . Inside himself Evans shrank from what he saw  --  the leg swollendouble-size clear to the thigh already , and the skin drawn bursting tight and the shank lumped and polkadotted with the black and blue of poisoned blood . Fairman took the heel of the foot , gently , and , while the boy whimpered , turned it so as to show the bite . Someone had cut at the fang marks , and the cuts leaked a black ooze that had washed little rivers in a black dust . All of them , Evans thought , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Mr. Byrd lanced him and rubbed salt and gunpowder in . It was all we knew to do . " " Do n't you know something ? " Judith Fairman 's voice was n't much more than a whisper . She had n't spoken before , and now he looked at her face , and there was such trouble there and so much of prayer in her voice that he could n't say the truth . While he hunted for a lie , Dick asked , " Did you suck him ? "  |p179She  shook her head slowly , as if under a gathering load of guilt for not thinking of sucking . Evans could n't look at her longer . He could n't stand to see hope trembling against despair , and her so young and comely and deserving . His eyes went to Rebecca , sitting silent , giving in silence of her strength . It came to him that women suffered deeper and endured longer and understood better than any man . In grief and death men were only children , as he was himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rebeccas of the world . The boy moved , and his half-shut eyes flickered , and a spasm wrenched him , ending in vomit that Rebecca tried to catch in her pan . Judith leaned over and wiped him with a towel . The boy cried weakly , " It hurts , Mother . " " Plainest words he 's spoke , " Evans said , trying to find the tone of hope . " I know , dear . I know . Do you want a drink ? " Judith 's face did n't cry ; nothing but the pale-blue eyes cried , putting the shine of tears on her cheeks . The boy did n't answer . He sank back , and his lids lowered , and Evans feared he saw the blue of death under the eyes and on the temples . He listened for Tod 's breathing . Fairman cried out again , as if they were all at fault , " Do we just stand and wait ? " " Easy , Charlie , " Evans said . He walked stooping to the doorof the tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you ? " Then , to the ones in the tent , " Keep ' im quiet as can be . Dick ! " Brother Weatherby still stood at the entrance . " I 'll be aroundif you need me . " " Obliged . Come on , Dick . " He led Dick over to the side , away from the people who had divided into knots and were talking in the tones of the sickloom . Dick said , his voice hard with helplessness , " There ai n't a thing to do , goddam it , Lije . " " Except to make Judith think every God 's thing was done . " Dick studied a minute and answered softer . " You 're a goodp180hoss , Lije . There 's a root the Sioux swear by , though it 's no account . I 'll dig some . " As Evans started back through the waiting ones , he felt a hand on his arm and heard the pipe of Mrs. McBee . " If we could git a warty toad , now , that ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You lay it on the bite , and if'n it lives , it draws the pizen out , and if it dies , you git another . " " Go find a toad , " he said , and pulled loose from the claw of her hand and re-entered the tent . " Dick 's gone for wild medicine , an ' he ' lows suckin ' still might help . " Fairman 's eyes met his . Fairman said , " All right , " and laid the blanket back . " I 'll do it , Charlie . " " He 's my boy . " Fairman bent his head . The boy did n't move as the foot was turned . He lay there quiet , he and his little leg and the big , black leg that would kill him . " We 'll put on a root-and-milk poultice , " Evans said . " That might fotch it . " Judith was stroking the hand she had brought back into hers . " He has n't had any fun , " she said , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new chance with him . The tears kept spillingfrom her eyes and sliding down the uncrying face . " He 's been sick so much . " Fairman raised his head and spit and bent it again . Judith went on as if she was all alone : " I should have played with him this morning . I should have known how tired he was of doing nothing . " " Do n't fault yourself , Judie , " Rebecca asked . " Please do n't fault yourself any more . You ai n't to blame . " Evans wished Judith would break down , wished she would begin to whoop and holler and take on as some women did and so ease herself and all the rest of them . Dick came in with a kettle of hot milk in one hand and some straggly roots in the other and sat down at the door of the tent and put a root in his mouth . When he had chewed it up , he spit it into his hand and took another bite . " All right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth . Some grains of powder showed around it . " What is it ? " " A root the Sioux use . " Dick moved up with his handful of chewings and plastered it on . " Got a rag ? " Evans asked . Judith took a towel from the pile by her side and leaned across to hand it to him . He went to the kettle and dipped the towel in the hot milk and folded it and came back and laid it over . Fairman spread the blanket again . " Would whisky help ? " Fairman asked . Dick just shook his head while he sat cross-legged , his face showing nothing but the hard patience to wait . Evans let himself down and put his hand to his neck that was stiff with stooping , and for what seemed a long time they sat there , out of talk , while Dick chewed fresh root and Evans dipped the rag in the heated milk that Mrs. Mack kept bringing back . From outside came the wordless murmur of voices . Judith 's far-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we were going to Oregon for . " Fairman broke in sharply , " Was ! " " I mean is , Charles . Is . " Evans stared at his hands , and then Judith cried out , cried the breaking cry that he had been wishing for and could n't stand now , and he saw the thick and sickly matter bleeding from the boy 's closed lids and knew that he was dying . He scrambled up and ducked outside , spitting " Bad , " to all the questions asked him , and found Brother Weatherby and asked him to come . Sometimes he felt like thanking God for preachers.  |p182IT  WOULD be a dry , raw day , windy-warm , and a man would go along licking his roughening lips while the juices in him parched away . Already , with the sun no more than a hand above the eastern sky line , Evans felt the touch of it on his back . It would burn later and hurt the eye with its glitter , and the wind out of the west would draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his head that Byrd 's cracked lip would n't get any better today . He stood with the rest , waiting on Brother Weatherby to start . Weatherby had his coat on and his hat off and his Bible under his arm . By him was the dirt piled on canvas and the hole left from it and the walnut box that held Tod Fairman . Evans did n't know what Weatherby was waiting for , unless for a goaheadfrom above . When , finally , the rusty voice sounded , Evans was back in yesterday , making the box again out of the chest that Rebecca swore she would n't need anyhow . It was a good coffin , better even than most made in Missouri , and he had found rest for his mind in the building of it . For the time , he almost had forgottensadness in measuring and sawing and hammering . He had eased it by the movements of his hands and the sight of the box taking shape under them , its joints tight and smooth and its lid close-fitting . He reckoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Patch and Fairman and picked a spot for a grave and , so Patch said , cut the sod and peeled it back as if skinning a fine fur . He and Patch had dug the grave , deep so as to be beyond wolves , and had pitched every grain of dirt on a cover . Evans lifted his head , for Brother Weatherby was done with praying for the time being and was saying that God worked in mysterious ways  --  which was the plain truth . He tried to stay on the track of Weatherby 's words , but his mind kept straying off ,  |p183asking  itself questions , bringing back the pictures of things seen . Rebecca and Mrs. Brewer had washed the little body and laid it out and wrapped it in its winding sheet and put it in the box along with the leg that fouled it and afterwards had sat most of the night through , kept company and later spelled by Evans and Patch and men and women who came and went , bringing meat and bread and sweetening , stammering old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet for the most part and dulled by grief . Rebecca finally had talked Judith into going off for a nap , but Judith did n't stay long and Evans doubted that she 'd slept . It was a long , hard night . Outside , things were quiet except for wolf howls far off and now and then a breeze that found the tent and whispered death and slid away , but the breath of time seemed to sound , of time and distance and things that had been and things to come . Hearing Judith sob as her loss came alive in her , feeling the press of misery on him , Evans was struck by the littleness of grief here . It had to be walled in , it had to be kept close in a tent , else it would blow like dust and be gone and never a sign of it remain in the high sky or on the long land . " Let not your heart be troubled : ye believe in God , believe also in me . In my Father 's house are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little boy care about a mansion ? His mother was the best mansion he had . But God worked in mysteriousways . Leave it to God ! There was n't any choice anyhow . Leave it to God ! Evans felt the tired sadness and the strength of Rebecca , who stood by him , her arms crossed loose under her breasts , her eyes big with misery and too-little sleep , and he guessed her thoughts were on their second-born , who had sickened and died in a year and so left all their hopes on Brownie , for Rebecca coud n't catch again . Brownie stood on his other side , in his face a boy 's wonder at the hard way of things . How could a man explain it to his young one , who expected goodness and fun not just all the days l ) I his life but all the days of his life forever and ever ? He could say it was the will of God , which probably it was , but that wasp184like saying he did n't understand , which he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a father and had to catch what comfort he could in knowing that death was an acident in the minds of the young . It came and was done with and would n't come again except maybe far off , at a time too distant to worry about . Bring comfort to the bereaved , Brother Weatherby was praying . Let them accept Thy will . Let them find comfort in Thee and be strengthened by Thy loving strength . Ahead of Evans , closer to the box , the Fairmans bowed to the prayer . They were a little apart from the rest , for people had drawn back to leave them with their grief . While Evans watched , Judith 's shoulders hunched to a choked crying . The prayer would be the end of it , except for a song and ashes-to-ashes , Evans thought , and then Weatherby lifted his head and pointed his bony arm and put power in his voice as if of a sudden his feelings had got the best of him . " God created everything and it was good ; save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shalt thou be and thy poison . " Scripture ? Was Adam 's curse Scripture , or just a saying that some people believed would make a snake crawl off and die ? Not that it mattered , and anyway the snake was dead . Brownie had chopped it up , or one just like it . In quick revengefulness he had grabbed the hoe when he heard the news about Tod and had gone off as if to square accounts and had come back with rattles in his palm . Evans had nodded at him , letting him feel that in killing the snake he had done the prime thing . More praying after the curse . More bowing down . More askingof comfort . For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous : but the way of the ungodly shall perish . Even in a funeral preachment Weatherby could n't keep from taking a lick or two at the swearers and the Sabbath breakers . A song then . " The Day Is Past and Gone . " A kind of queer song for a burying . Weatherby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed its age when he tried to sing , and the other voices joined in , frail beside the rock , frail over the lost tumble of country and the wild buffalo grazing and the breeze blowing out of nowhere into nowhere.  |p185The  day is past and gone ; The evening shades appear : O may we all remember well The night of death draws near . We lay our garments by , Upon our beds to rest ; So death shall soon disrobe us all Of what is here possessed . Lord , keep us safe this night , Secure from all our fears ; May angels guard us while we sleep , Till morning light appears . Evans walked up , along with Summers and Patch and Mack , and lowered the box with ropes , and Weatherby took a pinch of earth and recited ashes and dust while Judith broke down again . The crowd drifted off , going back to their wagons to ready for the start . Evans and Dick filled in the grave and carried what dirt was left and dumped it in the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick said while he shook the dust out of the canvas , " He 's got a queer way of showin ' it . " " I reckon you got to take God or leave Him , whole hog or none . " " You can have Him . This child would n't care for none . " Hearing Dick , Evans knew something about him he had n't quite known before . Dick was tender and tough , both , and the one explained the other when you came to think about it . Dick stuffed the canvas under his arm . " You go on . Give me a little time , and I 'll fix the grave so no Injun eye can spot it . " " All right . Might as well let me take the canvas . " Evans headed for camp . Halfway there , he saw Brownie coming to meet him . " Pa ? " Brownie said while still a half a dozen steps away . " What is it , boy ? " " I got the tent down and the wagons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So ? "  | " And it ai n't my turn with the cattle . " " What you workin ' up to ? " " So could I stay back and chisel my name on the rock ? " " You had all yesterday , Brownie . " " Not all . I stood guard and killed the snake and things . " " It ai n't safe . " " Please , Pa . It 's safe enough . You 'll be in sight for a long ways . " " Why you so took of a sudden to cut your name ? " " I just am , Pa . " Evans noticed that Brownie 's eye would n't quite meet his . The boy was holding something back , some foolish notion , likely , that was still his notion and his secret and not to be pried at by grownups who thought themselves so wise . He smiled into Brownie 's waiting face . " You 're doin ' a man 's work , boy . I reckon you can decide for yourself . Only hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . " " Thank you , Pa , " Brownie said , showing a quick and thankfulgladness . " I 'll wait 'll you roll . " " Watch for Injuns . " " Sure . " Evans walked to the Fairman tent . It was the only tent not struck yet , and Fairman 's teams were the only ones not yoked . He stooped and went inside and saw Judith seated on the bed , her face in her hands , and Fairman standing motionless . " Ai n't Becky here ? " Fairman did n't answer . " Can I help , Charlie ? " It was another minute before Fairman spoke . " She 's coming back . I 'll get to it . " " I could yoke your teams now . My outfit 's ready . " In the waiting silence Evans heard Judith 's held-in sobbing . " I 'll get to it . " " We got to roll , Charlie . You know we got to roll . " " I know . " " Not yet , please ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet , torn mouth that the hands had left , coming out of a  |p187face  past bearing to behold . " We ca n't leave him yet . Do n't you see ! We ca n't leave him . " " And not know where he lies ! " Fairman burst out . " Never again to know where he lies ! " " Toddie , " Judith said , talking to the grave . " Poor Toddie . " Fairman 's voice was rough . " Do n't you see ? Ca n't you see ? " Evans saw all right , and wrenched with the seeing , and he saw Dick Summers , too , poking his head in the tent and coming in silently and standing stooped , his face solemn and the twinkle gone from his eyes . " I kin always find it for you , ma'am , any time , " he said . Chapter Eighteen  |p188SUMMERS  LED OFF , and the wagons rolled into line , the Fairmans ' outfit right after the lead team though it was n't their turn to be shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , riding among the animals to the flick of reins and rope ends , and the horses and mules started frisky , snatching for last bites of the bottom grass before they ran . The cattle got going slow , stopping to bawl and spatter the ground , and crowded into the strip between Independence Rock and the Sweetwater . Brownie sat his horse and watched the train file away and fell in at the tail and helped push the cow column through . He held up then and waved at the riders and reined right and came to the even-steep western face of the rock . A man could climb here , though he had to watch for a slip that might crack a bone . He slid off his horse and tied it to some high-growing sage , wishing while he did it that the flies were n't so bad . Already , with the sun hardly more than two hours high , they were warmed up for he day 's business . There were little , yellow ones that bit like bees and gray ones with bulging eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy . They had followed up , out of the damp of the river growth , against a wind that still must have blown some of them away . He rested his rifle against the rock and laid his hammer and chisel down and went over Nellie , especially the tender , unhairedskin of her tits . His hand came away smeared with sucked-out blood . He wiped it on his pants and picked up his chisel and hammer . He would n't need the rifle , he figured . It would just clutter him up . He 'd leave it right here . The climb was stiff , though more dangerous-looking than dangerous , up the slanting face of rock flecked with grays and browns . Part way up , he stopped to blow , remembering toop189late that Dick Summers had said the way to mount a hard rise was to step slow , one step and afterwhile another , so as not to wind yourself . He faced around and sat , holding to the chisel and hammer that might clatter down if he let go . The train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull , heading for the gap to the left of Devil 's Gate , which from here was n't a gate but just a niche in a sudden pitch of mountain . Dick Summers rode in the lead , as always , trotting his horse to put a proper distance between himself and the first wagon . Dick was easy to make out . His buckskins marked him , and the rifle carried crosswise , and his way of riding , which was as if he 'd been born with a saddle between his legs . The riders with him were harder to fix , but they would be Botter and Davisworth and Insko , who usually herded but were going to have fun today , scouting ahead for buffalo , finding out for the train whether to stop and kill and dry meat against the climb over the pass . Brownie saw buffalo far beyond them , a small herd that seemed to swim in the shimmer of the morning sun . Closer , the wagons inched away across the reach of plain , tiltingright and left as the wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover in the lead and then the Fairmans and then Pa and Ma and then Holdridge or Gorham and Tadlock . Brownie ran his eye along the line , seeing could he make out every outfit . Some he guessed at by the dogs that trailed along , or by the children . There was n't any way to miss Brewer and his crowd , or maybe there was . B Ird and Daugherty drew a tail of young ones , too , and McBee . With his eyes closed , he thought , he would know the McBee wagon , for Mercy was driving . At this distance , with her no more than a flutter of dress and a shadow that marched before , he could see her , the straight , strong little body and the face above it that did n't smile often but spoke with the eyes . He remembered the voice of her that night at Laramie , not the words so much , not the " I 'll be all right , Brownie , " but the tone she used , the gentle tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she was , for as touching on the heart . Davisworth ? I fig ? Botter ? Moss ? Any of the single men ? Or the married ones like Mack that he felt thankful to for being nice to herp190family that the rest made small of ? No , it was his feeling and his alone , for no one else could feel the same , and he would hold it to him while he waited for the time to speak . The horses and mules followed close on the wagons , driven by Hig and Willie Brewer , and after them lagged the cattle , hating to face up to distance , moving balky while Gorham and McBee and Shields and Patch worked at them . They all had crossed the river , which meandered toward the Gate , its banks sprouting bushes close-pressed by the sage . Last of all came the dust , streaming the other way , driven hard by the wind . It was a strange sort of country , where the wind blew with hardly so much as a cloud in the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the flies . Up here there were n't any flies , or any dust-shot in the face , and the shadowed stone was still cool from the night , and a man could hear distance singing with the wind , from the mountains ridged far off to left and right , from the great pass and Dick 's Green River and from Oregon , where Pa said wheat was growing rich and stock fattened and fish swam solid in the rivers . A woman , tired already but not tired enough to ride , was hanging to the tail of a wagon , letting the oxen pull her feet along . It was Mercy 's wagon , and the woman would be Mrs. McBee , who could n't be very strong and so talked about miseriesand cures while weller people smiled behind their hands . Maybe they would act different if they really knew . Maybe the McBees never had had a chance and would show up good if given one . So they all got to Oregon , and he , known now as Mr. George Brown Evans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grain and animals , and he set up his in-laws , saying , " Do n't think nothin ' to it , " and they did just fine , and McBee shaved and tidied up , and a nicer bunch of people you 'd never want to meet . The dream did n't come sharp or stay long , being dulled and cut off by the underthought of death , of Tod Fairman and the life gone out of him and his mother choking at the burying , and , farther back , of Martin with no one to grieve over him except a nephew in Illinois who would get the money that hisp191little plunder earned when auctioned off at Laramie . Were they part of the sky now ? Was it their voices sounding in the wind , mourning at being gone ? Did they look down and see and know from under the wing of God ? He could n't imagine himself dying , but he could see himself dead , lying pale and cold while Ma cried over him and Pa said , " Boy ! Boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up now to the feeling she had had for him . How he came to die was that he stood off an Indian war party while the train corralled . He had stood between them , steady behind his horse , his aim true on the chief , and had brought him down ; and when his own horse had fallen , he had forted up behind it and drawn the pistols at his belt  --  he happened to be wearing Dick 's pistols  --  and done for two more before an arrow found him . People had said , after they had got his body and pulled the arrow out , that he was the bravest thing they ever saw . The bravest but also the deadest ! He shook the fool picture out of his head . He had to laugh at himself , making out to be so brave when like as not he 'd fill his pants if ever he met up with an Indian alone . Maybe he 'd turn tail and run . No telling what he would do . When he brought himself honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn of fear and so , except when he let dreams drift in his head , went around with doubt in him . He was n't stout inside but weak and watery . And what he did that might seem bold , like staying here at the rock , was n't bold at all , for there was n't any felt risk in it . He was about to get up and climb some more when he saw a dog loping back from the train . It was Rock , leaping highheadedthrough the sage , coming to see were things all right with him . " Here , Rock ! " he shouted into the wind . " Here , boy ! " He scrambled down the slant . " Here I am , boy . I come to meet you , like you come to meet me . " Rock trotted up to him , wet from the river , and wagged his tail and held his head to be scratched and touched Brownie 's palm with his cold nose . " You got no business to be runnin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't you know that ? But I reckon you knew I was struck with lone and so come to cheer me up . " The words soundedp192thin against the windy distance . " Now I got to do all that climbin ' over again . Kin you make it , boy ? " He took a dozen steps up and called to Rock . Rock held his head to one side , his whitish-blue eyes full of thought , and then , as if he had done with figuring and come to an answer , he stepped up to the face of the stone , took one great bound and found his footing and bent low to the climb , traveling faster than a man could go . " Easy , Rock . You think I 'm a bird ? An ' you got nothin ' to carry  --  remember that !  --  no hammer or chisel or nothin ' but you . " Brownie climbed by Dick 's advice , while Rock followed by little dashes , catching up and stopping , feet braced , while his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead , as if sure of the way now or put out by the pace . Toward the top Brownie met the sun , floating lazy in a sky bluer than he could find a word for . This way , he thought as the curve of it came in sight over the rock , it was as if it lay still , waiting for him to rise out of the west . He could be the sun , opening his eye on river and plain and hill while the world thought Brownie 's come up , Brownie 's shining , see , on yonder butte . By Dick 's system it did n't take much time or too much wind to get to where the rock leveled off , running then in dips and bumps not to be seen from below . Here the names were fewer , cut or scratched in the stone or painted red or black , for most men chose the footings of the rock to north and south , where they could stand on the ground or on boxes or kegs while they worked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cup unmarked by brush or chisel , but before he sat down to his task he stood with his head up , letting the wind blow him while he looked around . Only the tops and edges of the world showed here , far off , the rest hidden , all ways , under the spread of rock . He could n't see old Nellie fighting flies or the train crawling for the gap or last night 's camping place or Tod 's grave . There was just the flowingstone and the wind and himself and Rock and distance and the voice of distance.  |p193He  ran his thumb over the edge of the chisel . He would put her name first . That was the proper thing . He would put her name and then his own and then the day of the month and the year and maybe box them all in , so as to close forever in the stone the oneness of the two of them . A long time from now she was teasing him . Care for her so far ago ? Ah , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you ca n't josh me . And so they came back , man and wife , by stage and turnpike , and climbed the slant and were here again , and he pointed , saying , " There she is , just like I cut ' er back there in ' forty-five . " She kissed him , tenderness in her eyes and laughter , and said , " I knew you did , Brownie . I always knew you did . Do n't you know I just like to be told how you care for me ? " It took longer than a man would think to cut a letter . The tap of the hammer on the chisel left just a whitish scar that had to be deepened by tapping and more tapping , until the hammer arm tired and the chisel hand cramped . By and by he found it better to hit harder , to set the chisel careful and hit harder , squinting against the bits of stone that shattered out . Rock loped after some little birds  --  ground sparrows or rock wrens or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , his head on his paws , his big mouth leaking a little at one corner . " Just you wait , boy . It wo n't be so long . " He got her first name spelled out , and it was pretty , and set to work on the last after flexing his arm and hand to get new strength in them , thinking what would the people in the train be saying if they knew what his secret business was . They would smile at each other , probably , and make little jokes , as if his feeling was no more than a boy 's notion and not to be taken serious . He could n't let them know , he could n't let even Ma or Pa know , not till later , not till things turned out . Then it would be different . Then they could see they would have been making fun where fun was n't fitting . " Just me and you , " he said to the old dog . " Just me and you 's all that 'll know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't you ? " Rock gave a slow wag of his tail for an answer . Just himself and Rock and the little birds and the watchingp194sun and maybe Mercy herself , knowing with a woman 's knowing as she urged the team along that he had held back to set their secret in the stone . Just them and the wind , which spoke but did n't tell . Should he chisel the name he went by or the full and proper name of George Brown Evans ? The short one matched the length of hers better , so let it be Brownie . Mercy McBee . Brownie Evans . July 2 , 1845 . Set chisel . Swing hammer . Set chisel . Swing hammer . The sun was pretty high . Before he finished , Rock rose on his forelegs , facing south , and growled deep in his throat , holding back the bark while he kept sampling the wind . " What do you smell , boy ? A b'ar or something ? " There was nothing in sight except what had been there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . He let himself down as if not sure yet that his pose was right . Set chisel . Swing hammer . He had it now , all but the box to close it in . Set . Swing . Set . After he was through , he sat for a while , letting the wind dry up his sweat . Sweat was different here from in Missouri . It came and went . Did n't keep pouring out , sopping the clothes and dripping from the chin and smartingin the eye . He got up , stiff from sitting , and spoke to Rock . It was pretty chiseling , he told himself before he turned , and all the prettier because of what it stood for . " All right , boy . Let 's go down . " The chiseling had taken longer than expected . When he came to the brow of the butte , he saw that the train was somewhere out of sight beyond the Gate , maybe pulled up already for its nooning , for the sun was sailing high . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry , since a kind of emptiness , like homesickness , was on him now that he had done his work and had nothing to take his thought . It was n't fear . It was n't the dread of anything he could put a name to . It was just emptiness . There came to mind a mole that he had pitched out of its tunnel once . Sun and space had scared it witless , and it had run crazy on the open ground , wanting the close , blind walls of home . Rock scopped and growled again , his shoulder hair risingp195while he sorted the air , his eyes searching for what his nose suspected . " What ails you , Rock ? Tryin ' to scare me ? You got to be a fraidy-cat ? " Only by the quick dipping of an ear did the dog show he had heard . Brownie freed his arms for the down climb by putting the chisel and hammer in his pocket . He stepped short , so as to keep his heels under him , ready to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comin ' , you old fool ? " Rock looked down on him and back to where his nose had pointed and then , like a guard leaving his post , began to sidle down , his throat still rumbling . There was Nellie , fighting flies . There was his rifle , standing as he 'd left it . There was the trail leading away to the gap . In a minute he would be mounted . Not so far off in time he would catch up with the train , and men would be saying , " How-de-do , Brownie . What kep ' you ? Break your leg in a badger hole ? " Quartering down ahead , Rock halted , stiff-legged on the slant , and the growl in his throat boiled into his hoarse bay . He saw the reason then , saw the mounted Indians rounding the turn from the Sweetwater , their hides shining dull in the sun , their faces lifting to him from the wind-shelter of hunched shoulders . He saw them and froze , a wild sickness turning in him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scramble for the top while their mouths worked at seeing him and their arms waved him down and a hand lifted a bow . He could run and be outrun or get an arrow in the back . Or he could jump . It was n't much more than a long jump to Nellie , a long jump and a long slide , and then maybe a leg broken and the skin ground off his backside and the Indians on him before he could mount . Beyond his thinking his voice sounded , " Back , Rock ! Back ! " He tried to lift his arm , as he would have to Hig or Botter . He stepped downwards , fighting the rottenness of fear inside , fighting the show of it on his face , willing his hands to be steady , his feet to be sure . Easy was the way , if there was a way , poky and easy and assured . His mouth said a cracked " Hello . "  |p196One  slid from his horse and ran and grabbed the slanted rifle , waving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the little startlement of seeing him and sat their horses by Nellie , their dark faces upturned , their eyes narrowed under ratty hair . The wind brought him the smell of them , the rank , smoke-greasebodysmell . Nellie was trying to pull free of the sage . She reared up , smelling them , too , and fought the air with her forefeet . A young Indian with a long blister of scar along his cheek dropped from his horse and stepped to her and knocked her quiet with a stone he had picked up . She stood trembling , beaten by the blow on the head , while he stripped the saddle from her . One shouted and another , and they all were shouting , and motioning him to come down the dozen steps between . They pranced around , waving bows and raising spears , coming at him as if to run him through and then turning and yelling while the wind bent the feathers in their hair . The scar-faced Indian was throwing Nellie 's saddle on his horse . There was no choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a battered carbine that another young Indian kept aiming , hollering fit to kill as others brushed it off its bead . His mind and body felt far away , and fear was a thing reachingthrough a dream , and all below him came quick and sharp to his eyes  --  the Indians numbering upwards of twenty , the bare hides and crotch covers and leather breeches and one man with nothing on at all except a pair of moccasins and shells hanging from his ears , the sorry horses behind them and their sorry fittings , the mule rigged with white man 's gear , the lean dogs looking up , barking back at Rock . Then he was down , and hands were poking at him and arms pulling and voices yelling and eyes looking for the look of fear in his . " Here , now ! Here ! " He tried to make his tone strong . " Me , friend . " His hat lifted from his head , and his shirt tore to a yank  --  and it was n't any use to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man-size and unafraid while they pried and tugged and drew bows and made as if to spear him . Above their crazy yelling he heard Rock 's big voice and with it snarlings and the yelps of hurt , and he wrenched clear and  |p197saw  Rock swarming with the wolf-dogs of the Indians . Rock went down and rolled up , set upon from front and rear and sides by the half dozen of them , his teeth flashing , his gray muzzle already red-scarred . His old head ducked , and a dog cried high , like a whistle , and stood aside , one leg hanging while the fight heaved away from him . Rock sank under the pack and came up again , like a block out of churned water , and leaped free and could have run but stood fierce and proud and met the new charge and was carried over by it . He would die . The teeth were too many for him , the weight too great . He would die unwhimpering , not running or begging mercy or even asking for the help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the rightful help looked on , scared by Indianswho had stopped their fun to watch . Brownie felt weight in his pocket and knew of a sudden it was the hammer , not taken from him yet , and he jerked it free and lunged through the Indians , crying out without words . He swung , hammer head on dog head , and swung again while the fight surged around him and teeth ripped his shank . It did n't take them long , not him and Rock together . The two Indian dogs that were n't killed or crippled ran off growling . he knelt down and felt of Rock and saw he was n't hurt bad and got up , telling Rock to stay to heel , for the Indians were coming up . He held the hammer tight , thinking they would want to kill Rock , but they pointed at him while he growled his dare at them and shook their heads and made noises in their throats as if they prized bravery , too . For a minute in this quieter time Brownie felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for they turned on him then , twisting the hammer from his hands and wrestling him down on his tail while he cried to Rock to keep out of it . Two of them took places behind him , poking him with spear or arrow points when he so much as shifted on the ground . The others began to talk : gain , quieter than before , arguing for one thing or another . They mixed in front of him and waved their weapons aroundp198while they spoke , all except the scar-faced one , who 'd gone to beat the brains out of the crippled dogs . When he came back , he joined in , louder than the rest and violenter , and the young Indian with the carbine and the one with Brownie 's rifle sided with him . They dashed at him , turn and turn about , one with a spear outheld , the others with the carbine and the rifle , as if to put an end to him instanter , and faced around and yelled their thought and came at him again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and felt the points prick him from behind , and he made himself sit quiet , holding his fear in , holding it down so it would n't race the heart or shake the face or show up in his gaze . The three set the rest to shouting , as at first . They were all shouting , shouting and prancing and pointing and swinging weapons , so that the eyes swam and the head rang while the held-in fear beat deep with the heartbeat . Temper showed in the slant-eyed faces and hunger for blood and the marks of scheming and the stain of old war paint not washed off clean . An older Indian with a hawk 's nose and hawk 's eyes and deeppockedskin talked most against the three . He yelled at them and tried to wave them back and shouted at the shouting others , as if to make them see . But still there was no kindness in his face , none there and none anywhere , and no way to make them know he did n't wish them ill . He thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold his load of fear . A man could hold only so long , and then he broke out , wild for an end to things , good or bad . It was hours they 'd yelled and swung their arms and made their dashes at him . It was last year he 'd climbed down from the rock . Better to be dead quick . Better to fight and die than sit like a chicken while they argued whether to spear him or shoot him or wring his neck and did they do it now or later . The sun was swinging down from overhead , making for the west and home . Somewhere the train was lurching along , its people thinking of camp and supper and rest while Dick rode out looking for wood and water . Ma and Pa would be anxious by now , for they did n't look for him to be gone so long . Inside him tears welled up to be shed and an unsaid cry wrenched atp199his throat . Let the wanting legs jump and the wanting arms strike out and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and acting , the shouting died away and heads turned , and he strained for a look , not prodded by the points now , and it was Dick Summers like an answer to prayer , old Dick Summers galloping his horse across the flat , riding straight as a drawn line , his uncovered hair silvery in the sun , Dick Summers not scared of one Indian or a nation , coming to save him from his fix . The rising murmur of the Indians drowned out a cry that was half sob . Dick broke his horse to a jog and then to a walk as he rode closer . He clinched his rifle under one arm and got his pipe out and made as if to be pounding tobacco in it . He held it up and came on . Twenty feet from them he reined in . He was n't in a hurry to talk . His eyes ran over the Indians and took in the side of rock that flanked him on the right . His voice came big and rough out of his throat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had just a glance at Brownie , but at the tail end of his Indian talk he said , " Easy , hoss . I 'm makin ' medicine . " The hawk-faced Indian answered him , talking loud and gesturingas Dick had done . The carbine was itchy in the young Indian 's hands . It kept waggling as if about to come up and go off . Brownie slid over , unnoticed by his guards . Dick talked again , for what seemed a long time , making shapes with hands and arms and turning in his saddle and pointingback to where the train would be . Brownie thought it was in the nature of him , in his looks and carriage , in the straight , gray eye and the unafraid face , that the carbine should dangle in the restless hand and the young , wild mouths be silent . Hawk Face answered , shorter this time , and Dick spoke in turn , and for a minute there was silence , until the scarred Indianbroke it , nerved somehow to argue in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . They shouldered up to Hawk Face , their mouths running with words . Dick spoke short and , when he had their eyes , came up easy with his rifle , aimed toward the side of the rock , as if justp200pointing with it . The rifle cracked , and where one of the little birds had been was now just a pinch of feathers , glued to the stone by a spatter of blood . The Indians brought their hands over their open mouths , and their eyes hunted one another 's and went back to Dick . Dick spoke Indian again and got a quieter answer and saidto Brownie , " Come on , boss . This here spree 's over . Git Nellie . " " They got my gun and saddle . " " Best dicker for ' em later . Your hair 's still on . " Not an Indian raised a hand as he untied Nellie and climbed on , bareback , and called to Rock . They watched him silently and went to their own horses that had strayed toward the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Face and two others rode up , and the rest trailed behind , quiet except for what might be self-talk , slow-spoken . " Sioux , these niggers are , " Dick said . " Teton , or some cut of Sioux . " " Dick ? " " Got a camp somewheres pretty close . They was just hellin ' around . " " Dick ? " " Speak out . They do n't savvy . " " I 'm much obliged , I reckon you know . " " It was n't nothin ' . " " Dick ? " " This child 's listenin ' . " " I made a poor out of it , Dick . " " How so ? " " I 'll feel better for tellin ' you , I 'm that shamed . I was scared puky . " Dick put a hand on Brownie 's knee . " Shoo , boy ! Every hoss is scared in a fix . " " Not as bad as me . " " I seen you slide over to knock that Injun off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as if to see that none was fixing top201settle them from behind . " It 's these young niggers you got to watch . The Sioux ai n't much for mindin ' their chiefs . " " How 'd you do it , Dick ? " Before Dick answered , he and Hawk Face traded words . " First , I asked ' em if they 'd seen the great , white war party , meanin ' Kearny and his men . " " Did they ? " Dick shook his head . " Then I told ' em we spoke with one tongue and was headed for the big water and would kill any of their enemies we saw , specially Blackfeet . Said we had some red earth for their faces and beads and awls and such and maybe a little of the red firewater from the hollow wood , meanin ' whisky from a keg . That 's why they 're trailin ' along  --  for presents . " Dick talked to the other two Indians fronting up with him , speaking sure and comfortable as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let their horses drink and forded it and lined out for the gap that the sun was turning golden brown . Not till then did Brownie notice the wind was dying down to nothing . It was , he thought , like the wind that had blown mad in him and now was eased off , leaving him tired but good-spirited . Dick had said he had n't done bad . Everyone was scared in a fix , the first time , anyway . " I did n't look for you to shoot , " he said . " Kearny and presents did n't gentle ' em enough . So I said we had thirty men who would black their faces if you was hurt , an ' everyone could shoot as good as me . That 's when I fired . " " What if you 'd missed that there dickey-bird ? " Dick 's face creased to a slow grin . " Next I 'd 've said , Pleased to meet you , Jesus . Shake hands with my friend , name of Brownie Evans . ' " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I reckon you ai n't looked at this gun , Brownie . It 's my second one , an ' double bar'l , an ' I was readied up for Fowl . The bar'l I fired had bird shot in it . "  | EVANS WOKE UP early , before the camp was astir . He lay quiet , feeling done in but relaxed , done in from yesterday'slong worrying , relaxed from knowing that Brownie was safe in camp again and none the worse for his mix-up with the Sioux . If he listened , he thought he could hear Brownie 's breathing , from the bed laid near the tent under the sky . While he cocked his ears , there came to them a soft padding that he guessed was made by Rock , up early to see what the day had brought . It was dark inside the tent , so dark he knew Rebecca slept by him only by the soft breath-heave of her body . Outside it would be dark , too , and the juttings of land would rise strange and misshapen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yielding slow to the weak forecoming of the sun . He let his muscles melt into rest , let run in him the returned confidence in the trip and Oregon and all . They would meet more trouble . The hardest travel , the steepest climbs , the biggestrivers , the greatest calls on strength and purpose still lay before them ; but he was equal to it . Now , resting , knowing all was well , he was equal to it . A person could change in a day , or even an hour , from low spirits to hope . Yesterday , while anxiousness weighed on him , he had wanted to give up , to turn around and head back for the tame life of Missouri . He had n't been able to keep himself from looking behind for Brownie , though he knew Rebecca was watching him from her seat in the second wagon , building up fears in her mind as he was in his own . Independence Rock was out of sight now that they had passed the Gate . There was n't anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over in rounding the spur of mountain through which the Sweetwater cut . Only ahead could the gaze travel , runningp203along the high , flat , sagebrushed valley , picking up Split Rock in the distance . It was , he had thought , as if all that lay behind them was forever gone , as if there was no return , as if the one hard choice was to go on . It never had struck him so strong before that he could n't change his mind . They were cut off behind and closed in , far but fast , at the sides , by bald and stony mountains on the right , by green , high-rising ridges to the left . Where could that boy be ? Blowed away by the tarnal wind that just now was falling off ? " He 'll be all right , Becky , " he called back , setting his face in a smile . " You know how boys are . They got to have a look at everything , and time do n't mean nothin ' to ' em . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was in a flutter himself . What could have happened ? What could be happening ? Here it was drawing on toward camptime , and no Brownie . By now he could have chiseled out the names of all the company , alive and dead . He shut off the horrors that kept coming up  --  the rattlesnake lying on a ledge ready to bite the groping hand , the horse falling on its rider , the Indians sneaking up with drawn bows and scalpingknives ready . He told himself it was just Tod 's death that made him nervous , but still the fears arose . He should have gone back with Summers . He should have taken a party and gone back , though Summers waved the idea away . What good was Summers , good as he was , against a bunch of Sioux ? He should have put aside the push , push , push to Oregon . Oregon did n't mean anything without Brownie , just like it did n't mean anything to the Fairmans without Tod . The shapes that rose ahead , like Split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare , standing purple and red under the tiring sun . They might be warnings , he thought , warningsnot to go farther , to keep off wild , outlandish land untouched by the feet of the likes of him . Where was that boy ? He shook himself for thinking womanish . He was half sore at himself , at Brownie , at the train , at the country , at the whole damn business . Missouri was better , Missouri and boresomeness and drudge work unmixed with anxiousness.  |p204He  dropped back and spoke to Becky on her perch . " I 'm goin ' back , bein ' as you 're nervous . " " You 're nervous yourself . " " Account of you , " he answered , for once nettled because she could see through him . " Do n't lie , Lije . " " Ai n't lyin ' . He 's bound to be all right . " " I pray God so . You take some men with you . " " Ah-h ! " " You do that , Lije . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 'll tie this here team to the tail an ' you drive the lead . The goin 's good enough . Git down . " He walked ahead and whoaed his team and tied her oxen to his wagon and saw her down and up again . Before he spoke to the steers , he got his rifle out . " You take someone with you , Lije . " " Do n't worry about that . You just watch the teams . " He walked back along the oncoming line , expecting to bor .. row a horse from one of the drivers . He was about halfway to the horse herd when , beyond it , beyond the straggled line of cattle , upcoming from the far rise , he saw heads lifting , and shoulders , growing into horsemen that he took for Indians . He could n't be sure . He waited , squinting , with dread sharpening in him , and saw two figures unlike the rest and one of them like Summers . His eyes filmed with straining . He knew what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , regardless . He shouted , " Botter ! Bring your horse ! Quick ! " He jumped on , throwing out , " Injuns ! Git the men to push the horses up ! We 'll corral . " He galloped to the head of the line , crying , " Injuns ! Come on ! " as he galloped , waving the train on toward the stream where it would be sure of water come a siege . He curved it around on the bank . " Cap your pieces , all of you ! And stay inside . I 'll look . " He wrenched the horse around to his own wagons . " Becky , I seen Dick , and Brownie , I think . Looked all right . " He did n't wait for her answer . He kicked the horse , hearingp205her protest at his riding alone , and reined out to meet the party . The drivers had brought the horses close and headed the cattlefor the river and were making for the corral , racing to see who got there first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses inside ! You and the rest ! You got time for that . " It was Indians all right , Indians and Dick and one that had to be Brownie , one that was Brownie . Goddam , he thought  --  and no disrespect intended  --  it was sure enough Brownie , and Rock trotting by the side . He rode for the bunch , and they for him , until thirty feet apart , when Summers reined in and held up his arm for the rest to do so . " Company , captain , " he said . " Nabobs from the Sioux . " Of the words that crowded Evans ' mouth only a few came out . " You two all right ? They peaceable ? " " They wo n't rub you out , ' cept in fun . " " What do I do , Dick ? " " Git your pipe out and act to be loadin ' it . That 's peace sign . " " All right . " " I 'll camp ' em off a piece and fix for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as lief hold ' em the night , for there 's a village around somewheres . Ca n't take on the whole damn tribe . " " Kin Brownie come on ? " " Let ' im stay . He 's beaver , sort of , that they aim to trade . I 'll bring him directly . " Looking into the dark faces of the Sioux , seeing the bows and spears they carried and their eyes mean under the feathered hair , Evans could n't keep from saying , " I told you it was dangerous , boy . " " Pick some men for these niggers to smoke with , " Dick said . " We 'll keep ' em out of camp . They 're touchy sons-of-bitches . " " All right . " " Ai n't much risk now , Lije , long as we 're careful . Keep some shooters inside . Ai n't nothin ' whets an Injun 's appetite like scalps to be took safe . " Dick spoke to the Indians , and they talked among themselves , turning their eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orp206foe . They slanted for the river , toward a spot a holler and a half downstream from camp . Evans did n't wait to see them get there . He rode to the corral . " Everything 's good , " he told Rebecca before he began to give directions . " I 'll trade a bead for Brownie by and by . Now set easy . I ai n't got time for talk . " For smokers he named Patch , Byrd , Carpenter , Mack , Gorham , and himself and on second thought added Tadlock , who could do more harm with a rifle in his hand than a pipe . It was a good selection , he figured , that left in the corral some of the better shots , like Daugherty and Hig and Shields . The Indians showed up soon , led by Dick , their faces red- and black-smeared for the party . Dick stopped them fifty yards from camp , where Evans and the other smokers met him . Dick said , " Set in a half circle , " to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians , for they slid from their horses and let themselves down , grunting , all except one young one who 'd been named to tend the stock . While they were seating themselves , Evans chose a spot by Brownie . " How 's it , young'un ? " " They got my rifle and saddle . " " I knowed I shouldn't 've left you at the rock for a tomfool thing . " There was still the edge of soreness in Evans ' voice . He added , " It 's all right , though , long as you come out on top . " " All set , Lije . " It was Dick , speaking at his side . " ' Pears to me now 's the time to get the saddle and rifle back , before we treat ' em . " Dick said , " Right . It went plumb out of my mind . " He spoke then to an older Indian , the chief by the looks of him and the manner of the others , and the Indian spoke back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scar on his face . The young one got up , his eyes sulky , and made for the Sioux camp . They waited for him , the whites sitting silent and unarmed , glancing now and then to the corral as if to make sure the riflemenwere ready , the Sioux grunting once in a while , their bows and spears laid by , as Summers had directed . The young Indian came back , carrying the saddle and rifle , and pitched them in front of the chief and went and sat down ,  |p207his  face still surly . The chief pointed while he spoke . Dick picked up the stolen things and set them before Brownie . The saddle had been slashed with a knife , out of spite , Evans guessed . The chief was speaking . His voice came out , loud and measured , and his hands worked to it . There was a kind of force in him , a kind of practiced enjoyment like in a white politician holding a crowd . It seemed he spoke for a long time , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English . The Indians ' hearts were good , Dick said . The country belonged to them , but still they let the white brother pass . They let him kill meat and scare it away , so that they had to hunt far for it and their young ones cried hungry in their lodges . It was the way of white men to make presents , of powder and lead and beads and red earth for the face . That was good . Let the white man pass in peace , though he frightened the game . Evans knew it was his turn then . As captain he had to speak for the whites . While thought circled in his head , Dick said , Tell ' em anything , Lije . I 'll fix it in Indian talk . Tell ' em your heart 's friendly , but your arm strong if need be , and you got some presents for ' em to show what a heap you love ' em . Tell ' em we 're just passin ' through and do n't aim to settle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brownie , fetch that pack I got my Injun plunder in . " Evans made his voice roll out and his arms work . The white men were going to the big waters of the west , where their great father owned land . They came as friends , as the Sioux must know , for they brought their women and children with them . Men did not take their wives and babies to war . They were friendly folks , the train was , but powerful and ready to fight if they had to . Every man had a rifle and knew how to use it . They had brought presents for the Indians and pretties for their squaws , and they were glad to smoke with their friends , the Sioux . Dick put the one tongue into the other and afterwards said to Brownie , " You kin pass them awls around now , one to each , and then the tobacco the same way . I promised ' em a little whisky , Lije , fer the fix was tight . "  |p208He  went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucket and tin cup . " Wo n't be enough to put the devil in ' em . I watered ' er down . Now , Brownie , them beads to the chief , and the vermilion . " Tadlock spoke the first word spoken by the other white men , saying , " I think whisky 's bad business . " " ' T is so . " " You think a promise has to be kept  --  with savages ? " All Dick answered was , " Mostly , I keep ' em . " He passed the bucket among the Indians himself . The Indians drank , noisy as horses , and eyed the bucket after it was emptied . Dick got out a pipe , an Indian stone pipe with a long stem , and lighted it with the brand , pointing the stem north , south , east , west and up and down before he handed it to Evans . " Start ' er around , Lije . " It all went off easy enough . The Indians got up and went to their horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tobacco , taking along as a final present a big chunk of meat that the train 's hunters had killed . Later , downriver , their fire made just a spark in the dark , put out now and then by a moving body . So here he was , Evans thought , lying melted in his bed . Graybackfarmer . Captain . Speechmaker . Speechmaker and show-off . Him , Lije Evans , that did n't like speeches and did n't like shows , leaving them to the Tadlocks of the world . And to hear and see him were just half a dozen white men and the rest red , haunched down with their knees up and not enough clothes on , hardly , to patch a bullet with , their ears not understanding , their eyes dark and demanding on him , the bared skin of their shoulders and bellies looking like leather in the low-lying sun . It made him want to laugh that he had found a kind of pleasure in the speech , feeling sureness in him and strength while the words sounded out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed the train , too . Like with rules . Nobody had said anything about Dick 's whisky . Rules ? You hardly thought of them but made out as best you could according to the time . You voted them and let them lie . No whisky . No swearing . Whippings for rape and adultery and fornication . The moralp209law . The train was moral enough . Was n't a woman inviting anything , as far as he could tell , nor any man behaving bold . Still , the way it was with men , maybe the rule served a purpose , especially with unmarried ones about . Just because a rule was n't broken was no sign it was n't needed . Maybe just the fact of it kept it from being broken . He was amused a little , though . There would n't any whip get him , nor any man get to Rebecca . Gently , in order not to wake her , he put his hand upon her . The sentinel 's rifle brought him out of bed . " Time to shine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightening dark of the tent he pulled on his breeches and shirt , and then a jacket against the chill that night brought to this high country . Brownie alreadywas up , about to go out , along with others , to round up the animals . " Mornin ' , " Evans said . " You dream b'ars last night , boy ? " Brownie grinned . " Injuns . " Evans collected a few sticks and whittled shavings and got a fire started . When Rebecca came out , he rolled up the beds and struck the tent and began packing the wagons . It took time to get started in the morning  --  critters to drive up , oxen to hitch , a horse to saddle , beds to roll , tents to stow away , breakfast to cook and eat and clean up after . Around him while he worked he heard and saw and felt the bustle of the other wagons . Later a man would just wish for miles to pass . The sun was bulging up like a punkin . He could see where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see any Indians . Already they had lit out . And good riddance , he thought . While he was thinking it , Tadlock walked up . " Those red devils stole two of my horses . " " No ! " " The horses were down to skin and bones . I hobbled them and picketed them close , outside the corral , so they could get some grass . " " An ' they stole ' em ? " " I 'd have sworn I 'd hear them . Why , the mare had a bell on her . " " I be damned ! Hello , Dick . "  |p210Dick  had come up so quiet that Evans did n't know he was there until his eye caught him . " Tadlock here 's lost two horses to the Injuns . " Dick asked of Tadlock , " Them two ? " " Of course . " " I ' lowed it was risky . " " I could n't starve them to death . " " Bones is better'n tracks . " " What do you propose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll . " " You wo n't help me get them back ? " " It ai n't worth the gamble , Tadlock . " " Particularly when the horses were n't yours . " Evans said , " Damn it , man ! You was for rollin ' when Martin was dyin ' . " " That was different . We could n't help him . We can teach these red devils a lesson . " " Be out of Sioux country in a shake , " Dick put in . " You would n't stop to think , Evans , that your boy caused the loss ! " " How 's that ? " " He got us in the mess . " The words brought Evans up . He had n't figured things that way , and no one would but Tadlock and maybe lawyers . Still it troubled him that he might be partly in the wrong . " I do n't go along with you on that , " he said , " but I 'm willin ' to leave it to the council . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to you . " Tadlock snorted . Dick said , " To hell with him then , Lije . " " I aim to do what 's right . " " Right ! " Tadlock 's voice had a sudden fury in it , as if all that had happened against him was brought to point now . " But you wo n't track those Indians down ? " " No . " " I 'll kill an Indian or two before this trip 's over . " " No sense in killin ' one that did n't do you wrong , " Evans told him.  | " One 's like another . " " You faulted Mack for killin ' that Kaw . " " I would n't expect you to acknowledge that the circumstancesare different . " " Tadlock , " Evans said , " I 'm peaceable , but , by God , it 's hard to keep from twistin ' your neck ! " " It 's the truth that roils you . " " That 's as may be , but we ai n't chasin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll with us you best be gettin ' ready . " Tadlock spit out , " You 're the captain . " " That 's what they tell me . " Tadlock ground around on his heel and walked away . Evans saw Rebecca watching him from the fire she had fedsome sticks to , and he wondered how much she had heard . Notmuch , likely , at this distance . " That was the way , Lije , " Dick said . " Stand up to that mouthy nigger  --  but still it takes a heap to set you off . " " Does it ? " " A heap . " " I kep ' thinkin ' maybe Brownie 's part to blame . " " So you held in . Christ , it were n't the horses ! Not them alone . That staggy stud horse ca n't get over bein ' set down . One day you 'll have to geld him , Lije . " " I keep sayin ' I wo n't . " Chapter Twentyp212THE HIGH SWEETWATER , flowered along its banks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Sandys , Big and Little . The Green that trappers knew as the Prairie Hen or Seeds-kee-dee and , before that , as the SpanishRiver , winding wooded in the tableland of sage . High country , chill by night with the snow that patched the Winds , lonesome and good as when Dick Summers first had seen it but with the scar of wear on it , the scar of wheels that later wheels would deepen . The Winds rising , naked and bright in the sun , broody in the dusk , hiding the high valleys where he had set his traps , hiding the shame of no-beaver where beaver once were plenty . If he sniffed , he smelled the smoke of quaking asp , and , looking , saw the little fire and him and Jim Deakins and Boone Caudill seated around it while meat cooked on roasting sticks . If he listened , he heard the old voices raised at rendezvous , the hearty , young , old voices that laughed at age and change , the voices rich with strength and whisky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the full and easy voices goodtemperedby the squaws . Smoke of campfires lifting slow , hi-ya , Bill , and hi-ya , Buck , tepees white against the green , horse herds frisky in the mornings , coyotes singing in the nights , bright blankets on soft shoulders , held around young breasts , and young country all about , high valleys , beavered streams , good hunting , youth on the land , youth in the loins , and youth and youth and youth to youth , and who 'd have thought then it would pass ? Deakins was dead and Caudill disappeared , and of the mountainmen who had hunted and spreed and squawed with him , was there a handful left ? He did n't want much to see them , with years in their faces and aches in their bones and the pastp213in their heads so that all they could talk about , while whisky stirred dead fires , was this and that of long ago . Like with Joe Walker , a mountain man if ever one lived , whom the train had met on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew him , strong yet and able but with a half-sore sadness because his world was gone . Like with Tom Fitzpatrick , whom they 'd met still earlier , guiding Colonel Kearny 's Dragoons back from the divide . Tom was n't one to hang his feelings out , but in his face were old rememberings . It would be the same with Jim Bridger and Old Vaskiss at their fort down on the fork . He had given the fort the go-by , taking a short cut , hard as it was , to the Green and on toward the Bear , for the train had food enough and the oxen were harder-footed than before and the wagons mostly in fair shape , though shrunk and shaken some by the long , dry , sandy miles between Pacific Springs and the Little Sandy . Still , he had been uneasy , for the desert of the Green was rough going even for hard-case hunters and horses lightly packed . Could wagons and oxen make it , and farmers and townliversand women and their young ? He had dragged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forty-odd dry miles of it , over thirsty sagebrush and rifted gravel and down the harsh fall to the Green , the wind fierce in his face , the day sunstjoke-hot or snow-cold , for desert weather seemed always one or other . But it was water that mattered most , or the want of it . Not any place was there a drink for man or brute . " I do ' know , " he said to the council that Evans had called together . " I 'm thinkin ' we can come it , but it 's hard and chancey . " Mack asked , " And if we do ? " " Save two days , at the least . " " And if we do n't ? " " No do n't to it . There ca n't be any do n't . " " It 's worse , I reckon , than anything before ? " Evans said . " A heap . " " Worse'n what we 're bound to meet ? " " There 's a lot of hell ahead , Lije @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were gettin ' a taste of hell then . " ' Padlock agreed to that , saying , " We 're not traveling forp214pleasure . Maybe we can cut ahead of that company that passed us . " If'n it 's hot , we 'll have to roll by night . " " We ai n't scared of the dark , Dick , " Evans said . And so they had decided on the short cut , partly maybe becauseit was a dare , partly , Summers thought a little uneasily , because they did n't know how fierce the trip could be . They had cut right at the Little Sandy and headed across the divide and rolled down to the Big and filled buckets there and kegs and barrels eaten empty and had waited until the day cooled , for the sun was hot as a blister . At four o'clock by the watch that Evans carried , Summers had led them out . They traveled all night , bumping over the sagebrush , grindingby the beds of old lakes , crunching in the rifts of gravel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watched and tired of watching and went to bed , leaving the land so black Summers wondered if his sense of direction would guide him right . As the desert lightened with the coming of the sun , they stopped and doled out water for the critters and turned them loose for what little bait that grew and breakfasted on dried meat and bread baked day before and yoked up again and went on , the venturesomeness of the night worn off , strain in the faces now , droop in the bodies , lag in the legs that pushed feet through the sand . And this was just the easier part of it ! Behindthem the sun fired up , making distance dance ahead . There never was such a day in his remembering , Summers thought as noon scorched close , none so hot or breathless , none that made a reach of miles appear so far . He rode ahead and back and back and ahead , hunting in old memories for the way , seeing could he help with team or teamster when the course was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which a trust had weighed so heavy on him . Roll ! he urged from inside . Roll , goddam it , roll ! Roll , you graybacks ! Roll or die , while heat smothers you and your hearts pound in your heads ! Roll for the Green ! Roll coughing in the dust ! Poke the goddam oxen ! Roll ! Think , Summers ! Think hard ! Left or right or straight P215ahead ? How was it long ago ? You ca n't be wrong . How was it now ? Left , it 's left it was , left by the bulge of hill . Point the party left ! The McBee girl looking sick , sweating pale beside the wagon . Up , young'un , and ride . You want to catch a stroke ? Sand and beard cobwebbed on the face of Hank McBee . Sand rivered on the sweating other faces . The beat of blood in the cheeks . Emptinessin the women 's eyes , the look of seeking for a piece of shade . One ox down , and it unanswering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kill it ! Kill it out of kindness while the ravens wait and bring up another and go on . One ox do n't count , Brewer . Not in this fix . Roll for the Green ! Fairman done in and laid out in his wagon and his woman crying , and the sick heat-flush in the fair-skinned faces of Daugherty and Byrd , and what 's a cracked lip now ? Go it , you hosses ! Poke up the oxen that walk low-headed , bawling hoarse for water . Come on , you women with your crosspatch pups ! You wanted Oregon , did n't you ? Pray , Weatherby , pray but plod , and no knucklin ' under to the will of God ! By Jesus , Summers thought , these folks were strong , strong in purpose even when weak in body . Rebecca Evans walking stout , mettled like a good mare ; Lije helping those he could , encouragingall , his broad cheeks grayed by sand ; Patch , Mack , Brewer , Shields , and Tadlock  --  damn him !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust . Judith Fairman driving while a tear washed down her face , Mack 's woman stepping squinch-eyed , her chin hard to the west , and Daugherty unheedingthe thumping sickness in him . Strong folks , and strong for what ? For Oregon and fish and farms , for wheat and sheep and nation . And now it came to him , while his own skull tapped to the heat , that that was what had ailed the mountain man  --  he did n't hanker after things ; he had all that he wanted . It was push now , pull and push and strain at spokes , for some teams could n't climb a rise alone . Push or double-team . Push to the whistle of breath and the shower of sweat and the hammer in the skull . Push , Lije ! You 're a bull for work , I 'm thinkin ' . Push , Mack and Tadlock , Brewer and Patch and P216Shields ! Stout hosses , you all . Push ! It ai n't so far now . Less'n I thought . Lead team needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is ! There it was , the Green and shade and rest for all and pasturefor the ganted stock . It was still half a dozen miles away , down a long pitch too steep to drive and then across a humpy bottom , but the sight of it was like a double drink of whisky , and flushed faces broke into smiles and grainy voices joked , saying , " What was it you said , Summers ? Chancey ? The word ai n't knee-high to it . We made it , though , good as ary mountain man . " Women and children came from the line of wagons and stood chattering , the strain gone and the fret . The men unyoked the teams and let the wagons down with ropes , made serious again by work under the punishing sun , grunting to the pull of lines against arm sockets while the sweat ran out of them . When they were down and the teams brought up and hitched , Summers said to Evans , " Lije , these critters 'll be a handful when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll do , and dive in , wagons an ' all . " " What you tellin ' me , Dick ? " " I 'm thinkin ' we best drive on a piece and turn ' em loose and herd ' em forwards till they smell it . Plenty of time to get the wagons later . " " Thanks , Dick . Was n't for you , I 'd be a prize captain now , would n't I ? " " I do n't see no flies on you . " " Cold water on hot stummicks ai n't so good . " " No helpin ' it . " " I 'll get the oxen and horses and loose cattle scattered out some , so 's they do n't run over each other . What about Injuns ? " " No need to worry much . " It came out as Summers knew it would . Once they winded water , the critters would n't be held . They galloped crazy for it and plunged in . One ox he saw had just his snoot above the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day , the men with strength left in them brought the wagons up . The cutoff had n't been too bad but only close to bad . One ox deadP217of thirst and one of water and quite a few thrown off their feed . No wagons lost . No people dead . Of the sick ones all recovered quick , even Charlie Fairman . Now that the cutoff was behind them , Summers thought , he could torment himself some more by going back to days that had been . He tried to shy his mind away from them by making talk with Brother Weatherby , who rode ahead with him , " It ai n't so far now to the Bear . Barrin ' a breakdown , we 'll git there a spell afore dark . " Weatherby turned his gaunt face on Summers . " I marvel at your memory . You remember every hill and turn . " " Ought to . I been over most of it , time and ag'in . " " I still marvel . There 's so much of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he answered , Summers thought it was only the earth that did n't change . It was just the mountains , watching others flower and seed , watching men come and go , the Indian first and after him the trapper , pushingup the unspoiled rivers , pleased with risk and loneliness , and now the wanters of new homes , the hunters of fortune , the would-be makers of a bigger nation , spelling the end to a time that was ended anyway . He did n't blame the Oregoners as he had known old mountainmen to do . Everybody had his life to make , and every time its way , one different from another . The fur hunter did n't have title to the mountains no matter if he did say finders ' keepers . By that system the country belonged to the Indians , or maybe someone before them or someone before them . No use to stand against the stream of change and time . Time , he asked , what was it that you could n't bring it back ? Where did it go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nothing remain to mark it by except old men gummingpipestems while memory worked in them . A man could think , almost , there was a great journal somewhere , like the journals he had known travelers to keep . Turn it back and there you were again , high-spirited and stout , fresh again and free , and the earth fresh . Like on the Popo Agie , as he remembered . Like with theP218Crow girl . Ashia , running water , back in running time . It struck him queer again that he should think so often of her , who was just one of quite a few , and of the Popo Agie , which was just one of many . They had come , somehow , to stand for all the squaws and all the hunted streams , for fun and frolic , campfires at dusk , fires in the keen mornings , rich lifts , high passes , big doings , for the everlasting young time that was gone so quick . There on the Sweetwater he had wanted to cross over to the Popo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . He had wanted to see the singing waters of it and the trees that had known him and the place where he had camped and the ground where they had lain , marked still , maybe , by the press of bodies though too little for the eye to see . Weatherby said , while his gaze ranged ahead , " I keep thinkinghow different this land is from Indiany . " " Or Missouri . " " Or Missouri . " Not often did Missouri enter Summers ' mind as he came again to places deep-set in memory  --  the pass , the first water west that emigrants had named Pacific Springs , the Sandys , the Green , the glimpsed peaks of the Uintahs , like snowy clouds , where Brown 's Hole would be . It was as if Missouri never was , nor farming , nor Mattie and her fever . Those were the days of his giving up , of growing old before his time because his world was old . Hell , he was n't old now except in mind , except by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his eye keen yet , and he could answer to a woman . It was the way of thinking that made him old , the knowing that he had outlived his time . He could farm in Oregon and grow with the country , as Lije had put it , if only the thing seemed worth the try . If only he had n't known the Popo Agie . Day by day and night by night bits of the old years had come back to him , flashes out of the long-unremembered , out of the pushed-aside , out of the clutter of mind , brought to him by sight of hill and water , by doing what he 'd done before . Drying meat  --  and he was with Jim and Boone again , fresh-crossed from P219the Powder to the Wind , eating old bull blue with winter while they talked about spring hunting . Topping the pass  --  and it was a soft day and the cactus was blooming red and yellow , and he had said , " Them 's pretty now , " and old Etienne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm thinkin ' . " Seeingthe Wind Mountains , harsh-rising on his right  --  and he green then , unbelieving he rode on top of the world , asking , " Is this it , sure enough ? " The Green again  --  and his first sight of it , and beaver so thick you could shoot them in the eye , and everybody gay like in a child 's dream of finding pretties . He lived in the now time and in the then time , passing talk with people like old Weatherby , guiding , advising , hunting , joshing with Brownie or with Lije , while gone days and gone folks filled his mind . " Summers ! Oh , Summers ! You goddam old coon ! Ai n't seen you since we stood off the Rees . How be you ? Fat , I 'm thinkin ' . " Voices calling across the years , mouths laughing , hands slapping him on the back . " Worth a pack of beaver to see you , you of bastard , and if you got a dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for below them , far below , down one ridge and another , ran Muddy Fork and , beyond it , the rich , green valley of the Bear . " God in His goodness , " Weatherby half whispered as his gaze took it in . " In His might . " " It 's mighty , sure enough . " Weatherby wagged his head slow . " I could n't have believed it . I can hardly believe it now , seeing it . " " It 's some . " Bear River . The wooded , berried Bear , smooth-running through the roughed-up land . It had n't been named for nothing , for Weatherby 's God had put bears there , black and brown and , king of all , the great white bear , feeder on ants and fish and berries , unknower of the feel of fear . There was the time Summers had lifted a trap , heavy with beaver , and stepped out and parted the willows and looked Old Ephraim in the face , and it was one or the other right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Summers ' shot had struck fair in the chest , where a hand could have felt the beat of blood , and the bear whoofed it away and came on and knocked Summers over andP220fell on him . Summers wrestled for the knife at his belt , fur in his mouth and musk and blood in his nose and weight on him like a fallen horse , and then he realized the bear was dead . With a hole in his heart as big as a hoe handle he had charged . Old Ephraim , the mighty , the unafraid , the unforgiving , stoutheartedwith his heart shot out . " Best wait for the train , " Summers told Weatherby . " Got to angle down the slope and push the critters by some springs that it seems like I remember to be pizen . They 're God 's doin 's , too , I reckon . " A cloud came on Weatherby 's face . " They 're there for a purpose , Brother Summers . You may be sure of that . " " Fer the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom of God . " " What I 'm doubtin ' is these here springs . " Weatherby bent his head . " I wish you would see , Summers . You 're too good a man to be lost . " " Past savin ' , parson . Best keep your wind for the Injuns . There 's a heap of ' em in need of grace . " " But you think that 's no use ? " " Do n't recollect sayin ' so . They 're strong for medicine . " " Medicine . I keep hearing medicine , as if God and the way of salvation were just superstition . " " Maybe you can learn ' em that a cross has more power to it than a medicine bag . " Weatherby sighed . " Your lightness makes me sad . It saddens God , too . " " I did n't aim to damp you . You 're all right , parson . As fer God , He do n't have to stand between us . " Before Weatherby spoke again , the train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Y God , " McBee said , stepping up to them and looking down on the sweep of valley while his hand worried his beard , " she 's fair . " Summers saw the wagons down , slanting them one way and another so the pitch would n't be too steep , and rode back to the herders and helped with the stock , thinking about Weatherbyand his notions as he rode . Was there a scheme to things after all , and the present just a little part of it , and a man soP221small he could n't see it whole ? Indians . Fur hunters . Farm hunters . What next ? Was it all a stream that went somewhere , that had a sense too big to understand ? Aw , the hell with it . He was getting like Jim Deakins , who was dead now and maybe savvied how it was but , living , always wondered . If there was a scheme , it was messed up mighty sorry . The bottoms were shank-deep in grass , and flowers waved , and chokecherries were ripening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down from the wagons got down , a sudden frolic in them , smiles on their faces and little cries on their lips , and the men studied the grass and kicked up the soil and followed the rimmed valley with their eyes and allowed this would be fine farming country if only it was n't so far from things . Far from things , from markets and stores and churches and soldiers and law and safety and all . Far from the way that was their way . Summers put himself in that time of first seeing again  --  the river and its branches swimming with beaver , and berries ripe , and Old Ephraim bloody-mouthed from the eating of them , and not a sound except the sounds of nature and no white face , and the sun great and the moon great , and the world his and no one to say him nay . " There 's trout in the river , " he said to Brownie . " Trout big as rails . " He rode ahead and came to Evans . Evans raised his broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now I can believe in Oregon , Dick . " " Good , ai n't it ? " " Best ever I see , but I could do without these here mosquitoes . Becky 's goin ' to make a gooseberry pie and maybe find some greens . " " That 's slick . An ' there 's wild onions if you like ' em . Figure we can go on a few miles , to Smith 's Fork of the Bear , though there 's a hill between . " Evans bobbed his head . " I swear , Dick , I thought I was tired of plowin ' , but a man wants to stick a plow in this country . " " Yep . " P222Summers passed McBee and led out , traveling alone , for Weatherby had slid his old bones from his horse and was walking with the train . The day was cooling off , or maybe it was just that the valley was cooler than the sagy ridges . Or maybe it was the feel of fall , with August just around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaches of the Gallatin and Madison , a man could be thinking about the fall hunt , if there were any beaver to hunt and anything in hunting them . The sun swam golden as it westered , touched already by the moons to come . He climbed the hill and rode down it and came into the proper valley of the Bear and rode on toward Smith 's Fork and saw an Indian village ahead . They would be Snakes , he thought . They would be the friendly Shoshones that he 'd lived and traded with in his long ago . The Shoshones , paled by pale and unnamed blood , and their squaws fair to mountain eyes . He reined into the brush and found a game trail and followedit , wanting to make sure the village was Snake and not Bannock or maybe Crow or Blackfoot , who used to be far travelers . It was Snake all right . He turned into the open , his pipe in his hand , and dogs began to bark and faces turned , and a man got up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to Summers that this was White Hawk , White Hawk and years and weather , squinting to make out a face as altered as his own . " It is good to see my brother . " A shout came out of White Hawk , a sudden , childish shout , and he ran up while Summers dismounted and held out his hand like a white man , saying , " Big Hunter ! I thought you had gone to the spirit land . " Summers had to hunt for the words that used to come so easy . " I have been too many moons away . " Of all the Indians he had known , the Shoshones were the friendliest , friendly in a simple , trustful way , though they would steal you blind like any others . They were the friendliest and the gayest-spirited , and they gathered round him now , young men and old in pieces of leather and children bare as new-hatched birds , curious about P223the looks and manner and getup of the man that called them brother . Squaws eyed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if agreeable to peace . " There is meat in my lodge and a robe to sleep on , " White Ilawk said . " White Hawk is good . I lead many white men and their squaws , to the big water . " " Your squaw , too ? " " My squaw is dead . " " It is bad . It is bad for a man to have no squaw . " " It is bad . Do you hunt the Green still and the Lewis River ? " " And we cross the mountains for the buffalo . The Blackfeet used to fight . They do not fight much now . They are fewer . " Summers nodded . " The big sickness . " " I have meat and a robe , " White Hawk said again . " You are my brother . " " I will give you a squaw . " Before Summers answered , White Hawk called out , and a young woman with deer eyes came from a lodge , her body upstanding and rounded under the leather dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as he smokes with us . " She did n't speak or nod her head , but the look of willingness was in her face , as if he , old Dick Summers , was something under a robe . Maybe he was , he thought , maybe he would be after the long no-having , but it was still the mark of age that he should doubt himself . It struck him , in the little time before he answered , that doubts were age . Doubts of self , of the worthwhilenessof living , of the purpose of things  --  they were age . The young did n't doubt . He said , " You are good . I do not know . It is many moons since I lived with the Shoshones . I have been a long time away , and I do not know . My medicine is weak . " " Come and smoke . " " I must lead the white party to camp , and then we will all smoke . Does it please you if we camp upstream ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke and give presents and trade . "  |p224The  sun slid behind the westward hills , leaving high in the sky the blaze of its going , while wagons were set and tents pitched and Indian met white and the pipe passed and goods changed hands . Against the noise and movement of the meeting , the night fell gentle , dimming the sunset , drifting into groves and gullies to wait its time to claim the land . And then the moon swelled up , the red fires whirling in it , and whitened in its climb . In the still silver of it , Summers could see things plain  --  the faces of the smoking men , the clean lines of tree trunks rising , the Indian lodges pointing up , the caught moonglimmerof a blade of grass . The men smoked quiet , Indian and white alike , speaking only stray words that Summers put into one tongue or the other , for the solemn talking was over and the solemn smoking . Evans sat with him , and Patch and Gorham and Carpenter and Daugherty , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , the hunting was good , for sheep and deer and elk , and the fish were big and many . White Hawk would see that the Shoshones did not steal from their friends . He had posted soldiers to watch . How many miles to Fort Hall ? How many sleeps to the British house , White Hawk ? No air stirred , not a breath . The fire they had built grayed with ash , just the heart of it alive . And no noise sounded except the tiny hum of mosquito wings and the lazy words they spoke . The children were abed , and the women waited their men , and the dogs were quiet , and the wolves and coyotes not yet tuning up . It was as if the earth and sky listened while the question turned in Summers . Why did he ask instead of act ? He did n't believe in the sin the preacher did . Men and women were made different for a purpose , like he s and shes of any breed , and mostly he had done what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then for a thought of the half-breeds he might have left behind . But they would fare as well as Indians and better than a heap of whites . The Indians never shamed a bastard , nor called it wrong to let a brother have a woman . They had a right to their ideas , like Weatherby to his ; and mountain men took what they found and let the questions go.  |p225But  still he asked and , asking , knew it was the age in him that asked , for young Dick Summers would have gone ahead . Age asking not what was right and proper but was he an old fool who thought to catch the past by lying with a squaw , who thought to find the lost , high spirit under cover of a robe , in the body of a woman who would be lousy but also young and tenderand warm for him . He knew the answer . He would cover her and lie back and realize it was no use except for the minute'snow-dead fever , and thought would circle in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as of old . But still . . . But still . . . Overhead he heard the whistle of wings , and of a sudden the name came to him , the name of her who 'd been with him there on the Popo Agie 's banks . Broken Wing , it was , as near as he had been able to make out from the Crow . The One with the Broken Wing . A breeze fanned the graying fire , reddening the ash , and all at once the Indian dogs woke up , baying to the sky . He guessed old fires had a right to shine , if they still could , and dogs to holler for the moon . He got up . " What you smilin ' at , Dick ? " Evans asked . " Was I smilin ' ? Just feelin ' good , I reckon . "   LIJE EVANS had only part of his mind on hunting . An-J other part of it roamed around , thinking what he had seen and done and felt since leaving Independence far back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Big Timber , where the train had camped early so the stock could rest , feed and get ready for the leaner miles ahead . It seemed he could n't ever wrench all his thought away from the train . Try as he might , worry would come sneaking on him  --  about the state of the wagons and the stoutness of the oxen , about the Fairmans with their grief , about the hard going that lay before , about the great Columbia and the wicked rapids he had heard about . Whenever he was away from the train , like now , he had the feelingmaybe he was needed . Maybe something had come up . Being captain put a duty on a man he could n't take leave of even for a little while without the feel of guilt . He rode Nellie along the bottom , looking to the prairie and the brush and to the ridges on the side for sign of antelope or elk or mountain sheep . It was n't that the company was short of meat especially , not with Summers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry in the Bear . It was just that he wanted to get away for a while , to slide out from under the weight of the captaincy and get his breath and refresh himself . Most of the things he had thought to do while back in Independencehe had n't done except in piddles if at all . He had shot two buffalo on the Platte and one of them a tough old bull that would n't even boil tender . He had brought in one antelope . That was all . He had n't wet a fishline in the Bear . He had had time for fun , he reckoned , but not the notion for it . Duty fretted him too much  --  and for no good reason now . Everything was fine . There was n't a case of sickness in camp . No fevers . No bowel troubles . No one wounded by Indians orP227hurt by accident . The train was just lazing along the Bear , but for a purpose  --  to strengthen horses and cattle and especially oxen for what Dick said were stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bear twice , to round a mountain that jagged in from the east , and had saved a hard climb by it , though adding to the miles . But the fords were safe enough . The Bear was a slow and peaceful river , with trees growing on it to float the leaky wagons with if need be . He wished the Snake would be as easy , knowing that it would n't . Yes , he told himself for the tenth or twentieth time , the train was in good case . He had a right to hunt , though it seemed he 'd go back empty-handed . The people had got along fair with the Indians , though the Snakes were quick and sneaky-handed and had made off with pots and kettles and knives and a rifle and some pieces of clothing , including the many-pocketed coat that Tadlock liked to wear . Tadlock had got sore as a sore-tailed bear and grew even sorer when old White Hawk could n't get his men to give their plunder back . Said White Hawk could make them if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawk had the coat himself , which Evans did n't believe . He figured White hawk had tried , both to stop the stealing and find the stolen things . It was just that a word would n't stay a thief or make a thief fork over , in red or white crowds either one . But it was n't any use to argue so with Tadlock , who thought a head roan was n't head unless the rest obeyed . Some of the others of the party were ill-natured from their losses , too  --  Daugherty , who missed his old flintlock , and Holdridge , who lost a knife and bridle , and Brewer , who wanted back his cookall , and Shields , who said his woman turned up shy a skirt . McBee had n't lost a thing but talked mad just the same . Well , Evans thought while his eye ranged , they would get over it . This was too good a country to stay mad in . Soreness did n't team with the wild oats and barley and rye that softened Nellie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grasses , nor with a kind sun . He pulled Nellie up and let her reach for a bite of feed and sat quiet while she savored it and the green juices slobbered from her mouth . It was too good a country , where the children ran safe , chewing balsam gum and rollingP228rocks down hillsides , where the women tinkered happy over food seasoned with wild yarbs and talked about the sermon preached by Weatherby last Sabbath . That was one day , anyhow , the train had given up to worship . Weatherby had gone again to Ephesians for his subject , exhorting on the verse , " Awake , thou that sleepest . " In a thieving country , Evans thought , it was good advice in a way that Weatherby did n't mean . He let Nellie foot along aimless while she cropped at the grass . Of all the land that he had seen this seemed the richest and the peacefulest  --  woods , water , pasture , soil laid down for a plow , all closed in , all protected by hills high-rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green , better than the Sweetwater and , God knew , better than the Platte . Maybe it was better than Oregon , except a man would feel he lived upon an island . This place was Oregon by the reckoning of Summers , who set the line between the waters of the east and west . And it would be settled one day . It was bound to be settled , he knew now . No keeping it from being . People would come west and more peoplewould come west , as he had himself , not thinking exactly why but knowing just the push of feeling , as if God Himself had willed it . He could see them , wagon after wagon , train on train , winding up the Platte , toiling up the mountains , fordingthe protesting rivers . Some of them would sicken and some of them would die , but the great company would come on , for the thing was greater than any grief . The pictured line caught a man 's imagination . It made him wonder . It made him somehowbig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head as if to see did he mean it and fell to cropping again , and he did n't care . He did n't guess it was for hunting that he had come out . A new time , he thought . History written on the land by the turn of wagon wheels . A new , good time to all but men like Summers , who could n't feel the deep excitement of it . They had been turned different , these men , shaped past changing by tools now wearing out , by beaver and Indians and danger and lone-P229ness . They were like deep drammers ; what they thirsted after was more of what they 'd had . Still , maybe not with Dick . Maybe he would come to see , maybe settle in Oregon as Evans hoped and be the important man he could be . There was n't anything beyond him if he set his head to it , governor or Congress or whatever . And he could still hunt some and sometimes pitch a camp and so lead a balanced life . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason why he kept saying things were all right with the train . It was becauseDick had drawn off from him somehow , leaving him , he felt , to manage almost all alone . Dick would come if called ; he would help if help was asked ; but still he 'd quit the old close teaming that kept the spirit stout . He was different from before , different in a way that Evans could n't quite explain , as if the sight of things known long ago had won him off from interest in the train . Dick was , Evans thought while he wondered if it was just a kind of jealousy that made him think so , a little like a man who saw an old sweetheart and up and left his marriage bed for her . He snorted inside when the thought was formed . Be damned if he was n't womanish , womanish and weak ! He would handle the train by himself then . It was about time he learned to stand alone . But still he could n't keep his head off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four of Bridger 's men , four dark and weathered men who talked spare in front of strangers and , by themselves , spoke language strange to settled ears , saying " this child 's thinkin ' " and " ' pears to this coon " and " we was froze for meat , we was , " and " wagh . " Evans had sat around their fire with Dick at night while Dick 's whisky got drunk up and memories worked and tongues loosened , and he had felt like an outsider even with Dick , for here was a side of Dick he did n't know . Here , glimpsed in the talk , was a strange , wild life that Dick had been a part of and a big part , too . ' Member the time the goddam Crows lifted our cache , Summers , and it was you went to make medicine and came back with the furs and a smart-looking squaw to boot ? Never could figure the way of that , Summers , ' less you catchedP230the squaw in a berry patch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help in stealin ' back our plews . She was gone on you . She was now . Putty as paint and a gone beaver on you . An ' damn if you did n't traipse off with her . You was allus kind of a loner , I 'm thinkin ' Member that nigger you had to rub out on the Siskadee , back in ' twenty-six or ' twenty-eight or sometime ? Took so much of him , you did , and dast him to irons and give him the best of it and kilt him afore his finger could bend . Wagh and Jesus Christ ! Them was fat days . . . . Savin ' that cheerwater for kingdom come ? This hoss is terrible dry . . . . Ai n't so poor a bull hisself , this child ai n't . Got two calves with the Nepercies and a purty Shoshone heifer that 's camped with that there preacher-doctor , Whitman , by Walla Walla , and 's gettin ' manners rubbed off on her . Hearing them , seeing the side of Dick he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just shaking hands with the man he had been . And over the meals at camp , where Dick sat silenter than usual , not making fun with Brownie or teasing Rebecca , he said Dick was only reliving old times and would come out of it . But still he felt the touch of loss . He pulled up Nellie 's head , thinking he would never get meat if he just sat on his tail and let his head spin , and then , against the scant-grown hillside , he saw movement . It was an elk , a young bull by the looks of him , too distant for a shot . He reined Nellie over to some brush and circled around under cover and came to the ridge and tied Nellie in a patch of trees where thieving eyes would n't find her easy and went ahead on foot , wishing while he stepped that lie could hunt like Dick . Let a critter show itself and Dick became part of the land , noiselessand unseeable , like a fawn in the grass or a snake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wept over the game trail he followed and saw the young bull standing in an open place ahead . He pulled one foot even with the other but did n't raise his rifle . It was as if he waited for the notion to shoot , for the arms to want to lift and the eye to want to sight . Waiting , he thought how much the grown mind ranged . Take a boy or a young man , now , and he would think but of the killing , andP231his breath would breathe eager in his chest and his hand tighten on his rifle . He would n't parcel out his brain , to the bull and Dick Summers and the camp and maybe troubles ahead , and was n't this a fine day , though , in a fine land . He would n't see the blue flax waving nor the sun patterned on the grass . The bull would blind him to all else , the bull and the brown hide and the young horns and the liquid eye . Sometimes it seemed too bad that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the ball and fell thrashing in the brush , and Evans went to him and bled and rough-gutted him and then walked back for Nellie . Later he led Nellie toward camp , turning now and then to see that the elk was riding all right slung across the saddle . She did n't like the looks or smell of it and kept snorting as it shifted to her step . " Whoa , now , Nellie , that there bull wo n't bite you . " It was a fair load for her even if there had been room for him besides . It was n't suppertime yet , though the mountains had shut the sun off , when camp came into view . It was a good sight , he thought as he neared it  --  the wagons squatted into rest , the stock grazing easy to eastward , the tents light against the green of woods and turf , a feather of smoke rising , untouched by any breeze . It would be a pretty evening  --  pretty , too , for the mosquitoesthat swarmed out as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to make you wish it different . The sight of camp reminded him he was hungry . He hoped Becky had made a stew like she promised , with wild onions cut up in it and maybe dumplings floating . You could n't beat her for stews . He was within a yell of camp before he noticed the men gatherednearer by the river . He thought , while a little uneasiness turned in him , how poor a mountain man he was . Dick would have spotted the men first thing . There were eight or ten of them , close-grouped by a tree that held a branch above their heads . Tadlock he made out as he walked closer , and Brother Weatherby , then Brewer and McBee . He did n't try to single out more , for now he saw an Indian with them , hands behind him , naked from the crotch strap up . P232Brewer held a rifle on him . Weatherby and Tadlock were arguing . Tadlock had a rope . The fact came slow to Evans , and then he hardly believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one moved there except for Mrs. Brewer , shooing her young ones out of sight . He could n't see another soul until his eye fixed on the tents and saw the heads of women poking . He dropped Nellie 's reins . The men did n't notice him until he spoke . " What you all aimin ' to do ? " Tadlock turned around , the rope tight-held in his hand , and a quick displeasure showed on his face . " You 've got eyes , have n't you ? " Weatherby turned , too . " They 're going to hang a man . " His long finger poked at Tadlock . " I warn you , Brother Tadlock , you 'll be breaking the Commandments . The sin will be on you . " If it 's a sin it will be on all of us . " " We kin stand it , " McBee said . " What you want us to do , say thankee to a thief ? " " Thou shalt not kill . " " Do we argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the heat in him giving an extra Irish to his words . " Go away ! " Tadlock waved at Weatherby . " You 've done your duty . Now go away ! " While they yammered at one another , the Indian stood quiet except for his eyes . They went from face to face . He was n't much more than a boy , Evans thought , an Indian boy no older much than Brownie , standing naked except for a tag of leather , standing dignified with a molty feather in his hair , hiding the fear of death if fear was in him while old palefaces fixed to string him up . " What'id he steal ? " Evans asked . " Enough . " " What'id he steal ? " " Damn it , he was wearing my coat for one thing . For another , Shields caught him chasing off a horse . " " That ai n't hangin ' business . "   " It is to us . You find it mighty easy to be lenient when your things are n't stolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses up to you if the council said so . " " The council ! " " How was it Shields did n't shoot him ? " Daugherty spit . " Ah-h , he is a trader , that Shields . He has two lousy buffalo robes and some fish , but no rifle innymore . " " I catched him all the same , " Shields said . " It 's better this way , " Tadlock told Evans . " We 're going by law . We 'll string him up and let him swing , and these thieves will know what white man 's law is . " " Law ? " " Let 's git on with it , " McBee put in . " We sat on the case , " Tadlock answered . " We voted . " " Who ? " " Those we could find . Some were fishing and some hunting . " " Did n't put yourself out to find them as would disagree , did you ? " " We found whom we could . Would you mind stepping out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know . " Evans said , " You do n't care about them . " " Or about the Commandments , " Weatherby added , working his long finger . " We care about justice . There were just two votes , besides Weatherby 's , against it . Byrd 's and Fairman 's . " Tadlock had made a careful loop in the rope . " If you have n't got the stomachfor justice , go away like they did . " He held the loop in one hand and the coil in the other . " Make way ! " The Indian stood quiet and straight-eyed as before , his hands behind him . They were tied behind him , Evans realized suddenly . Before lie stopped to think , Evans asked , " Where 's Summers ? " Tadlock answered , " Out with his mountain friends , I imagine . What difference does that make ? " Holdridge had n't spoken before . Now he said , " We figgered maybe we could limp along without ' im . "   " Yah , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do it . Yah . " For a minute they all looked at Evans . In their eyes he read his weakness . In them he heard himself again , bleating out , " Where 's Summers ? " His gaze fell below theirs and traveled on the ground and came to Weatherby , who stood at the side as if praying , and went from him to the feet of the Indian and climbed up and saw the boy , dirty and thin and sturdy and unflinching , facing death because he had done what it had been born and drilled in him to do ; and a sudden fury took him over , rising out of shame and outrage . " No , " he cried out , " by God , you do n't do it ! " There was blood-hunger in the faces , blood-hunger such as he had seen in the faces of the Sioux , hunger and vexations and itching disappointments like Tadlock 's and envious no-goodness like McBee 's and fret and strain and worry and boredom , all now to be spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy . " Drop the rope , Tadlock " Tadlock took a tighter hold on it . " I said drop it ! " Evans took a step and then another and shoved at Daugherty when he tried to come between . " Rest of you ai n't really in this , ' less you 're bound to be . This is between me and Tadlock , and long a-comin ' . " Tadlock threw the rope aside and squared away . Evans never had hit a man before . Never in his grown life had he struck out . Now , seeing Tadlock 's hands lift and rage darken his square face , it was as if it was n't him that swung but someone kin to him and far off in his feelings . The swing missed and left him open , and Tadlock struck twice , the short and heavy blows of one who knew the use of fists . Evans swung and missed again and felt the double hammer of the practiced hands . The blows shook him . They jarred his brain and struck lights in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew he fought clumsily , flaying out at air while his feet staggered under him . His strength was no good to him . The slow strength that could lift an end of log that two men could n't hold was no good ; itP235worked wild and awkward , leaving face and belly open for the stunning fists . A lick landed high on his cheek and nearly knocked him over , and when he found his balance he stood rattled and let Tadlock work on his face before he could think to go after him again . He heard cries like little echoes around him and in the wheel of sight saw the men ringed about and the Indian watching , his hands rope-held behind him , and , farther out , the women pushingup and Becky at the front of them . Blow and blow and lick on lick , and the brain stunned and the eye dimmed and his fists forever off the mark , and in his mouth the salty leak of blood . He was strong and he was right and he was beaten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swings and stand as long as could be ! Stand for Becky ! Stand for Brownie ! Stand for what he knew was right ! He was standing yet . He could stand some more . It came to him as Tadlock 's fists battered at mouth and jaw that he could stand a long time . He could stand forever . There was n't power enough in Tadlock 's arms to lay him out , or wind enough in his belly . Here was Tadlock backing off , mouth working lake a landed fish 's , blood in his unbruised face and sweat on it , and in his eyes the peaked owning-up of doubt . The wild fast found its mark , and Tadlock spun half around and tried to get an elbow up before the next lick hit . He lunged for footing and set himself and got his two blows in and stag gered at the answer to them . With all his power Evans swung at the boned line of his jaw . Tadlock did n't falter and then melt . He slammed backwards all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and moved a little and lay quiet with blank , half-opened eyes . Evans pulled in a breath and looked around the circle , at Brewer and Holdridge and Daugherty and the rest , and then he walked to the Indian and untied him . He did n't see the Indian slide into the brush , for Rebecca tugged at his arm as the rope came loose . " Come on , Lije . " " What ? " " Your face is a sight . "   " That do n't matter . " " I 'll doctor it . Come on . " He stood uncertain while the world steadied around him , the trees getting fixed again by the river , and the people singling themselves out , and Rebecca 's face not just a blur but a face with eyes that held pride and pleading both . He saw Mrs. Tadlockwas bending over her man , and Weatherby bending with her , and the men watching out of questioning and guarded faces . Nellie grazed beyond them , grown used to the elk across her back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rage that had made him glare his dare at the men , and he said , " We best see to Tadlock first . I did n't aim to hurt him bad . " Afterwards he felt cast down but somehow wholer than he had been . It was n't fun to beat a strong man down . It left a wound upon the winner deeper than blackened eyes and broken lips . But still he had had to take his choice , and he had taken it and stood by it , and the taking and the standing made him a wholer man . When Dick came into camp , he said , with the quiet grin in his gray eyes , " I hear you done the needful , Lije . " But Evans did n't have to have Dick 's words to feel solid in the right . Chapter - - - - - Twenty-Two   While THE CHILDREN shouted around her , Mercy McBee dipped up a cup of bubbling water and stirred a spoon of sugar in it and handed it to Tom Byrd . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup reminded her of a catfish'smouth . " I 'm next , " Dolly Brewer was yelling above the rest . " I 'm next , ai n't I , Mercy " " You are n't . I am . I am . " " I said fourth . " " Did n't , either . " " Did so . " " Hurry up , Tom . " They were all crying at her and at one another , crying and pushing and shoving up , the Byrds ' children and the Brewers ' and the Daughertys ' and Harry Gorham and her own brothers and sisters , each of them wanting next on the soda water that boiled out of a low , white mound . Stirred with the sugar that Mrs. Tadlock and Mrs. Mack had given , it made a sweet and fizzy drink . " Land 's sake ! " Mercy said . " Just wait now . You 'll all get some . " She cupped it up without letting herself think about the taste of it , for the thought troubled her stomach as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm goin ' from the littlest to the biggest . That 's fair . " They quieted for a minute , and she heard again the regular sh-h-h of another spring , closer to the river , that surged in its closing of rock , making a sound like one of the steamboats she had seen on the Ohio . All night she had listened to it , the puff of it like a hard-blown breath above the murmur of the river and the voice of the wind in the trees . " Sh-h-h , " it said and breathed in . " Sh-h-h , " as if it knew .   " Here , Dolly . " The train was camped out a piece from the river and the spring she dipped the water from . She could see the women stirringaround it , poking fares and readying Dutch ovens for the bread dough they had mixed , using water from the springs in place of yeast or saleratus . This country was all springs . It was all a kind of giving birth , the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " All right , Billy . " " And then I 'm next . " " I 'm after you . " The men were hunting , or fishing upriver , or watching the stock across the Bear , where the graze was better . Only Brownie Evans was in sight , wandering among the tents and wagons as if lost for company . " Now me . Now me , Mercy ! " She was glad for the children , glad for their shouts and shovings . They kept the mind filled and the hand busy . She said , " I 'm all right , " when Mrs. Brewer came from camp , waddling with the child she carried underneath her apron . " Nah , " Mrs. Brewer answered . " Too much time you could n't giff . Not good , it is not . De madders take de young vones now . " " Wait till the sugar 's used up . " Mrs. Brewer stood solid and silent , a mild cow of a woman with the little calf lumped in her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of getting up . She marched the children back to camp when the last grain of sugar was gone . Mercy watched them traipse away and listened to the young voices complain . She sat dangling the cup from a finger , thinkingas the voices faded that the earth might be coming to an end , and this here , this now , was the last of it , the river flowing into nothing , the sun going forever home , the high hills darkening , the spouting water saying its last , " Sh-h-h . Sh-h-h . " The sh-h-h that others would be saying if the world went on . Sh-h-h ! Mercy McBee ! Do tell ! It could be the end and she would n't care . The end was rest and peace in the mind and nothing mattering any more . She bowed her head with the sick weight of thought in it , P239telling herself maybe it was n't so . It did n't have to be so . It could be it was n't . A body could n't tell for sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how foolish was her misery , and she would laugh then because her fear was a child 's fear and there was no cause for it . She tried to put herself forward in that time , tried to gaze back on herself , sitting here with shame and sadness , and it was as if she was two persons , the cheerful one ahead and the fearful one by the spring . Why , she bad studied herself a dozen times , when the brush offered a place or the tent was empty . She had looked and she had felt , and there was n't anything wrong . She was flat and slim as ever . There could n't be anything wrong . For a minute she felt the spurt of comfort and of courage . Things would turn out right . No need to cross a bridge before you got to it . Plenty of bridges never came to be except in the mind that built them . Then her stomach turned with sickness . The cup trembled from her finger , and she set it down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of fear , trying to bring it in from hands and legs and head and lay it deep inside the chest . Ma would throw up her hands and take on terrible , crying , " I tolt you to stay clear of men , did n't I ? But , no , you knowed better , and this is what comes of it and serves you right . ' Fore God , I do n't know what got into you . " What Pa would do or say she did n't know , but it would be like him to go to Mr. Mack and brave around and settle happy for a horse or ox , as if that was the price of her . While she pulled fear in , she understood it was Aunt Bess who 'd made her look on Pa for what he was  --  a windy man and no-account , " slack-twisted " in Aunt Bess 's words , though she never out and gave that name to him . Aunt Bess had kept her when things went extra hard , which generally they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes to see , so that , when she went back home , she saw the dirt and ugliness of it and Ma dragged out and shriller as the days went by . If she could talk to Mr. Mack ! If she could put her head on his chest and cry to him how it was ! But he had n't made a way to see her again , not but just one time after Laramie , which seemed so long ago it was something on the edge of dreams andP240she would n't think that it was real except that her stomach churned and her time was past . But still he was with her . Still she took him to bed at night and got up with him in the morning and traveled with him by day , her hands pushing back the black lock of his hair and smoothing the trouble from his face . And it was n't body-hunger for him and never had been much , but just the wanting to find strength and kindness in him and to give them back . She watched for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frowned face and the quick way of him , acting as if she was n't watching . Sometimes when their eyes met , he would smile or say hello , and she wondered , seeing him so common , did he remember ? Did he hold the secret and was it dear ? Did he cry for her inside ? Her stomach queased again , bringing her to now , bringing her to this , and a prayer spoke in her . O God , let it not be so . I pray , help me , God , and forgive my trespasses and make it so I can talk to Mr. Mack . Please , God , make it not so , I pray Thee . A voice spoke , Brownie 's voice , saying , " How de do , Mercy . Why , you 're cryin ' . " She brushed at her eyes and went to get up and was suddenly so dizzy she had to let herself sink back . " It 's this fizz water brings tears to my eyes . It 's this fizz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . She saw just the blurred feet of him , shuffling as if not knowing what to do . " Mind if I set ? " " I was fixin ' to go . " " I wisht you would n't . " " You could set , though . " He sprawled on the ground . " I want someone to talk to . " " There 's others besides me , " she said . She bad laid fear back . She had brought it in and laid it back , and it was just a heavinessin her , weighing on the heart . " Better to talk to you than some I could name , " he said . " Nice place , ai n't it ? Been to Beer Springs ? " " No . " " Pa says it tastes like old beer , with the life gone out of it . " " I would n't know . "   " I tried it oncet . Made my stummick turn . " When she did n't speak , he asked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ? " " There 's work to do . " " It 'll get itself done . " With fear closed in , her eyes had dried , and she let them lift and see his face . It was an honest face , with sandy hair and freckles like stains underneath his tan and a gaze that would n't see inside her . " Wisht you 'd walk . " " And just let work go ? " She tried to make her tone light . " That'ud be a party thing . " " You 're the purty thing . " The words came out of him like a blurt out of one of the springs , as if they had been building up and would n't be held and so spilled out of his mouth in spite of him . The blood rising in his face drowned tan and freckles both . Before she thought , she said , " Purty is as purty does . " " Purty does all right , I bet . " " You do n't know nothin ' about me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to walk ? " His eyes , she thought , were a little like those of the old dog , Rock , that had trotted up and sat by him and watched her with a round , slow-winking stare . Before the open begging in them she said , " Ca n't stay long . " He did n't give her a hand up , as Mr. Mack would have , but stood awkward and unsure while she got to her feet , but of a sudden she felt close to him and somehow in his debt , for here , in her aloneness , was a one that prized her . Would he prize her no matter what , she asked herself while she waited for the dizziness to die in her . Would he if he knew ? They walked downriver , beyond the camp , beyond the steamboat'sbreathing sh-h-h , and carne to Beer Springs , and he tried the taste of it , and they sat down afterwards behind a white cone where water had stopped flowing . The crust that the springs had made showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .   " You ever think what you 'll do after you get to Oregon ? " he asked . " Just keep on helpin ' Ma . " " I mean after that . " " Not so much . " " I think a heap of things . I aim to work hard and get along and own a nice farm and have time to hunt and fish . " He leaned back and put the heels of his hands at his sides to brace himself . " A heap of things . Like about you , f'rinstance . " " I ai n't much to think about , Brownie , " She was sorry afterwardsfor what she 'd said , for the words were teasing words though honest-spoken . He answered , " You are so . If I could just tell you  --  " She would n't lead him on . She would n't help his tongue to tell . She did n't want him , and , even if she did , she had no right . She had no right  --  and fear marched in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , and it had risen , heavy and terrible , and she wanted to run wild into the hiding wildness or to cry out and fall weeping and give herself to earth . " I 'm nigh eighteen , Mercy . " " I best go . " " Pa got hisself married younger'n me . " She kept silent , drawing fear in , putting it quiet in its secret place . " I reckon you know what I 'm set to say . " Now that the thing was out , he turned to her , and face and eyes and all . of him were honest and humble with his wanting . " If'n I could just feel you felt the same as I do , there would n't nothin ' hamper me , in Oregon or wherever . " She ought to say no to him , no , Brownie , do n't talk that way , but the face was too much for her , and tears washed in her eyes . " I ai n't ready to think about it , Brownie . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I feel the same , but I thank you all the same . " She could n't keep from crying . The crying started deep in her and wrenched up and broke out , and she put her hands to her face and felt his arm go across her shoulder . " Why , it 's naught to take on over , Mercy . Do n't have to cry on account of I want to marry you . " The hand lay gentle onP243her back . He held quiet , as if he knew she had to cry though the why of it was lost to him . She wiped her eyes later , leaning over so as to use the hem of her dress . " I did n't mean to act the fool . " " You could n't act the fool to me , Mercy . " His hand carne under her chin and lifted her head and turned it to him . There was concern in his face , and questions and kindness , and of a sudden he bent and kissed her cheek , kissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You allus look so sad , " he said , dropping his hand and drawing his arm from across her back . " Wisht I could make it so you did n't . I 'd do any-thing . " " You 're good , Brownie , " she said . " Whatever happens , I know you 're good . " She got up because she could n't talk without more tears , and they went back , saying little , and neared camp , and he said , " I hope this ai n't the last time I 'll get to walk with you ? " " I do ' know , " she answered and turned from him and walked and arrived at her family 's wagon and heard Pa saying , " I swear , woman ! Hurry up them victuals ! This country makes a man all gut . " She waited in the dark . She made herself a shadow in the dark so that people , looking , would take her for a bush or for a cloud across a star . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would come later . A breeze ran on the ground and touched her legs and went on , whispering the night 's secrets , and she trembled to it , not from cold . The sounds of a camp about to go to bed came to her  --  the late close of a lid over a cleaned kettle , the tired voice of Mrs. Byrd with her young , the rumble that was the quiet , man-towomantalk of men before they gave themselves to night . They mixed with other sounds , with the sh-h-h of the spring , with the thin sky-crying of coyotes far off , with the moo of a milch cow over a lately-born calf that the Gorhams had carried in their wagon . She was alone with sound . She was nothing but the ear for sound , and sound would n't be except for her , or she be but for P244sound . She could lose herself , if the ear would close to it , and be nothing at all except a stray remembering in people 's minds . She pulled her coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the last look around . Wait for the last chore before people took themselves to bed . Once she thought the stars were wishful . Once she asked the stars to watch , the close , warm , happy stars that drew off now to shame her . Music had sounded then , and feet skipped in a dance , and it had sounded tonight and other feet had skipped , making of the fiddle 's wail the opposite of sorrow , and Hig had sung a song of love and death that smiling people said was mighty pretty . Lost echo of music and sh-h-h of the spring and cold eyes of the stars . I declare , Mercy , you 're off your feed and what upset you so and it was that fizz water likely . Cry of coyotes and the moo of the calved cow and the springs giving birth and sh-h-h . Tan and freckles and I 'd do anything . Black lock against a wrinkled brow and say no , Mercy . Nothing but the sounds of night and nothing but the night around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared I 'm in a fambly way , Mr. Mack . Sh-h-h . And wait and wait . A dog came up , unseen , and nosed her hand , and she started and calmed and felt him to be Rock and held him with her while she waited . She knew him when he stepped out , knew him by the thin , clean shadow that he was against the shadowed night , and boldnessdied in her and her legs trembled to run ; and then she thought he 'd go about his business before he knew that she was there and she would have to hold still or creep off in the dark and so not shame him with her knowing . She said , " Mr. Mack , " and . heard her voice as no more than a whisper , drowned by the sh-h-h of the spring . " Mr. Mack . " " What 's that ? Who is it ? " Then , lower-voiced , " Oh , hello . " " It 's Mercy McBee . " " I see now . How are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to her , not answering . In the cover of the nightP245she let herself search his face , seeing the peaks of his cheeks and the pockets of his eyes in the starshine . " Mr. Mack ? " " You 're up late . " " Do n't reckon I could sleep . " " Good night for sleeping . " " Mr. Mack ? " " Yes . " " Could we get away a piece , so 's to talk ? " He took her arm without answering and led her out from camp , down toward the steamboat spring . " It has seemed best not to try to see you , Mercy . " " I would n't try to see you but  --  but  --  " " What is it ? " " I 'm afeard , Mr. Mack . I 'm so afeard . " His voice sharpened . " Afraid ? " She only could nod , feeling from his tone the blame lay all on her . " Of what ? " " You know . " " For God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's probably just your imagination . " " I been tryin ' to tell myself that . " " Well ? " " Tellin ' do n't make it so . " " I ca n't believe it , Mercy . " " What if worst is worst ? " " It wo n't be . I 'm sure it wo n't be . " " But if it is ? " " If it is , it is . " " What kin I do ? Must be you know somethin ' I kin do . " " What do you think I can do ? " " Nothin ' , I reckon , except go back to camp . " " Do n't you see I ca n't do anything ? " " I did n't aim to cause you trouble . " " Cause me trouble ? " " I did n't mean I was holdin ' it over you . " P246Of a sudden his voice softened . " I 'm sorry , Mercy . It 's just that I do n't know what to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all ? " " Nothing but wait and see . " " I 've done done that , " she answered , and it seemed strange to her that her voice was steady . It came thin but steady , from some lean , raw , lonely strength that would n't bow to tears . While she wondered at it , he asked , " Have you thought about marriage , Mercy ? " " To who ? " " Well  --  to anyone ? " " An ' never let on ? " " I do n't know . " The voice in her said , " Talk do n't seem to be no use . Must be your wife 's expectin ' you . " He cried out then , cried fierce but soft so that she felt the misery in him . " Mercy ! I 'm sorry . All I can say is I 'm sorry . " He left without patting her , without touching her , without the kiss that she had thought would give her comfort ; and she knew , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had wanted her only for the time , only for what his body found in her , and never again would come to her even to get more of the same . Sound came back , the river complaining along the shore , the steamboat hissing , the coyotes crying louder as the moon flushed up , and , listening , she asked herself if she could wrong a boy like Brownie . Curtis Mack did n't go immediately to his tent . He walked away from Mercy , toward it , and thought Amanda would n't be asleep as yet , and turned and wandered down the valley , his mind aware but motionless before the fact . Ahead of him the hills bulked huge , lined against the sky by the rising moon , and , nearer , the waters of the river ran troubled under the long moon-slant that took them from the dark . There was nothing to do , nothing he could do , nothing but wait , nothing but return to his tent as the girl had said when P247anxiety had edged his words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to camp , " she had answered with a bleak , offended couragethat wrenched him more in recollection than event . She had n't wept . She had n't blamed him . She had n't threatened . She had asked , humbly , and been answered in a way , and had dismissed him with her young , brave , hopeless dignity . Thinking of her , he hated himself , hated his shabby answeringto her need , hated the cheap suggestion that she marry . He could have given her of his strength . He could have tried to reassure her . He could , at least , have shown her tenderness . But to what end ? To continue and compound a situation already made impossible ? To give her false hope ? Asking , he knew lie argued late to justify himself . The reasons might be good enough , but at the time they had n't been defined . What had moved him was a male 's annoyed alarm , the wish to wiggle out , the half-aversion bred by disagreeable responsibility . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was the one . He stumbled and said , " Goddam it ! " and caught himself and went on . He was a fool and a villain , or a man made villainish by circumstance , by the crazy , contrary , mindless unorder of life . There was yeast in him , not willed there by himself , and yeast would out , in the murder of a Kaw or the ruin of a girl . Preachers could talk about morals , as if all men were born and situated similarly , but morals were particular to every man , dependent on his stuff and state . And yet a man felt guilt . He could n't master self and circumstance , but still the fool felt guilt . It was senseless , senseless as the self-reproach of an idiot for being born that way , but it existed , wrought by hymns and texts and fierce mouthings about rewards and punishments . Long after reason came , the feeling stayed . Forever after . A man could deny God , knowing the afflictions that were a contradiction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sinning sins that the Great Sinner forced upon him , he wanted to atone , to humble and flagellate himself , to promise to do better . That way he found comfort , as lie , Curtis Mack , had found comfort in hard work and unaccustomedpatience with Amanda after the killing of the Kaw . It was in the nature of things , he thought , that now , with aP248better understanding reached between his wife and him , the consequences of misunderstanding should arise . Too late , if ever , one fell upon the answer to his plight . It had been simple , so simple , if so wise , that he wondered at his blindness . Hot and swollen with his need there near the Southern Pass , he still had kept his voice in check , saying to Amanda while they lay in bed , " I wish you would . I wish you could , Amanda . " " I wish so , too . " " I understand the fear , but it is n't fear alone , not just of pregnancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his words . " Part must be resentment , and I understand that , too , I guess . No one likes to answer to demand . " " No . " " Do you know what it is ? " " Only that something gets in the way . Only that I feel I ca n't . " " Always ? " " Not always . You know that . " " Do n't you feel desire ? Ever ? " She did n't answer , and he thought he felt her stiffen in the bed and knew the line of inquiry was wrong . The old , hot words came to his mouth , and he shut them off , making himself think about the Kaw and himself and the chastening regrets , about Amanda and the strangeness that she could n't alter . It was no less inviolable because it tortured him . He said , " we can wait . Maybe , if we just wait  --  " and turned over in bed . " I wish I could , Curt . " " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was true . " I 've fixed the idea of demand in your head . If I had it to do over again , it would be different . " " How , Curt ? " " Maybe , if we had another try , I could make you see I need you , not your spirit alone or your body alone but all of you . And I would n't demand . I would try just to let you know that I stood in need of your help and that you could help me , P249and that I could n't help it that I needed help . I guess that 's what I mean . Good night , Amanda . " For a long time she lay still , and then her arm slipped around him , almost shyly , and her hand found his and asked him to turn over . He was n't fool enough , he reminded himself now , to think their troubles entirely at an end . The difference in their appetiteswas too great to allow of miracles . But they had made a start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming to adjustment , each trying to keep in mind the other . And he felt fulfilledand knew he loved his wife beyond all women . So it would have to be in this , God 's world , he thought , that an accident should come between . It was n't in the scheme of things for happiness to last . He stopped and faced about and started back . Too long an absence might call for explanations if Amanda kept herself : awake for him . It was fear , he knew , that underlay his other feelings . Not fear of the lash . To hell with it and the shame of it ! And not fear of Amanda , quite , but of the loss of her , and not of the loss of her , for he felt she would n't leave him , but of t lie loss of love which was the loss of her . He had n't known till recently , till now , how much it meant to him . And so , he thought , walking heavy-footed under the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mercy . She was a girl-child and pregnant and alone , and he worried for himself . ' chat was the scheme of things , too  --  self-preservation  --  but it was ugly just the same . And repentance and remorse and pleadingsfor forgiveness , what were they if not concern for self ? Would he regret his act but for the consequences ? He tried to see the question honestly and did n't know the ; answer . Then he thought no , he would n't regret , if no harm at all had come to Mercy , no harm beyond the act if that was harm , no pregnancy , no disclosure , no shame , no heartache , no making of a trollop of her . He would n't have regretted even his own faithlessness , for there were reasons for it then . There was the hitch , there was the kernel , existing whether there was God or not  --  had a man been right with man ? He sawP250the girl again , standing small , standing brave , standing with that piteous dignity in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said , " O Christ ! " and shook himself and quickened his step , as if a man could outpace thought , and came to his tent and went in . Amanda 's voice said in the darkness , " I almost went to sleep , Curt . " " It 's such a grand night out . " He sat down and started taking off his shoes . It was also in the nature of things , he thought as he crawled into bed , that she should be waiting for him tonight . Far off , the wry manipulators of affairs must be grinning to themselves . Long after Amanda was asleep , he lay sleepless , hearing the murmur of the river and the singing of coyotes . He wondered if Mercy McBee , age fifteen or sixteen , also lay awake , kept from her young girl 's dreams by the beat of fear . He wondered if the Kaw he 'd killed was happy in the happy hunting grounds . One thing he knew . Whatever happened , wherever he was , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his guilt . Chapter - - - Twenty-Three  --  YOU 'LL HAVE YOURSELVES a spree , I 'm thinkin ' , " the oldmountaineer said . " This nigger 's been that way , and it 's some , that 's what it is . " He was , Lije Evans thought , about the age of a hill  --  allow a hundred years one way or the other  --  and he sat on the ground with the solid ease of a hill , as if he never needed a chair or back-rest for his carcass . Greenwood , his name was , Caleb Greenwood , and he was green like an old , gray tree that still put out leaves . " Ai n't I right , Cap'n ? " There were eight or ten of them squatted around in the Fort Hall yard , outside the dried-mud building that Captain Grant used for office and home . The yard was in shadow , for the sun had fallen below the walls of the fort , and the beginning feel of night was in the air . Captain Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , he looked even bigger than he was . He had England written all over him . He brushed his beard with his hand . " The Hudson 's Bay Company never has tried to get a wagon train through , " he answered . " Why not ? " Gorham asked . Captain Grant shrugged , putting into the movement more than tongue could say . Evans asked himself whether he was ready to dislike the man just because he was British . He had been good enough to the train , good enough to be better than you might expect from a damn Britisher . He had welcomed the company and traded with it  --  and made himself some money , which , still , was what he was in business for . You could buy flour from him , brought by boat and horse from the Oregon settlements , at twenty dollars a hundred , or horses at from fifteen to twenty-five each . IfP252you did n't have money , he would take your sore-footed oxen and allow five up to twelve dollars for them . Good man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want Americans taking over Oregon . That stood to reason . What he had to say about the trail ahead had to be taken with salt . " Some of you 'll git through , and maybe some wagons , " the old man said and took the pipe from his mouth and looked around . " Ai n't likely the whole kit and b'ilin ' of you will , but some will , an ' have a heap of fun . " " How ? " Tadlock asked . " Why , to look back on . Starvin ' an ' thirstin ' and nigh drownin ' makes rich rememberin ' , if so be it you live to re-member . " " We done all right so far , " Evans put in . " Shore you did , boy . Done smart , this nigger says . Ai n't quite the whisker of August , and here ye be . " " Well ? " " More this nigger thinks to it , " Greenwood said , and stopped while his old lips kept his pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' along . Calif orny way is too by-jesus tame . Nothin ' the whole length of her to test a man . Nothin ' to remember ' cept easy goin ' . " He had smoked his pipe down , and now he tilted the ash from it and packed in more tobacco so 's to smoke it back up without having to relight . " Shorter , too , to Californy , but this nigger 's got to point that way . Said I would an ' I by-jesus will . " Summers had been sitting quiet , the lines of inside smiling at the corners of his mouth . He said , " This child 's been yan side of the Big Salt Sea , with the Diggers . Seems like it sticks in mind . " " Sure enough ? " Greenwood answered as if he did n't understand . The look of thinking ahead was on Patch 's sharp face . " What did you say they raised in California ? " " Nothin ' . Nothin ' ' cept what 's sot in the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she is , and so goddam sunny a man wonders ai n't there ever no weather there . It ai n't like Oregon thataway. "  | " Let 's talk straight , " Tadlock said , hitching forward on the ground . " Why do you think we ca n't make it to the Willam-ette ? " Old Greenwood spread his hands . " Did this nigger say that , stow ? Said some of you would . Shore . There 's the Snake to ford twice , ' less you cross it here at Hall an ' run into hell 's trouble like Wyeth done , Dick , in ' thirty-four or sometime , an ' the Snake ai n't no piss-piddle of a river even if you might think so , seein ' it from here , but you 'll git over , most o ' you , and maybe some wagons . An ' , oh , man , but it 'll be fun . Do ' know as I would try the wagons , though . There 's plenty wagons for sale at Oregon City , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd leave the wagons here . " " Ai n't wagons gone through before ? " Gorham asked . Greenwood answered , " Some . " " Tell us some more of your fun , " Tadlock said . " Ai n't so much more , but damn me fer a liar if fer days you do n't roll along her rim and no drink for man or brute , and t here she flows , so goddam far and steep below you could n't leg it clown and back from sunup to sundown . " In the thinking quiet Evans smelled the smoke of dying cook fires inside the buildings flanked around . The fires would he dying at camp , too , which was pitched south and west of the fort about a mile , and Rebecca would have the plates and kettlescleaned , for the camp had eaten early , and Brownie would he watching out against the friendly , thieving Snakes . There were other smells here , the smells of smoked meat and fish and hides and tobacco , the sour aftersmell of Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-breed carried by . The milk put him in mind of Independence and home and the cowshed and the Missouri flowing not so far away . He said , " We know somep'n about rivers . " " Shore , boy , " old Greenwood answered . " The Missouri or the Mississippi , I 'm thinkin ' . Nice water . Come to think on it , what you aim to do with your cattle ? " " Take ' em along . " " Oh ! An ' then after the Snake , or Lewis River like sometimes we call it , you come to its pappy , an ' there 's more fun . You kinp254say you seen the chutes and falls of her and the black , by-jesus rocks smotherin ' in foam . It 's a sight , I tells you . Wuth seein ' . " Evans let his gaze go from man to man , wondering if they felt like him , wary of this grandpa of the mountains but still fazed by the word of trials ahead . The company just yesterday had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black dust this side the Bear , and had come down into the valley and seen water and woods and grass and bobolinks and killdeers , and he did n't guess anyone wanted to move again , much less tackle what Greenwood was putting into words . " I reckon you all know Meek , " Evans said . " He swears he 's learnt a better way to Oregon . Up the Malheur River . Said it ' ud save a hundred and fifty miles and more . " Captain Grant nodded . " Steve Meek . He broke with the train he was piloting and hurried here to talk himself into another . I wonder that you did n't see him when he passed you . What did you tell him ? " " Told him we had Summers . " Captain Grant said , " Right . I would n't care to try that trail , would you , Summers ? " Dick just shook his head . Greenwood started up his song again . " You got such a smart start , maybe you 'll git to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Course , you 'll have rain , one day on another , fer the rainy season 's nigh here . What was it you said you aimed to do with the cattle ? " " Take ' em . " " Oh ! They 's a passel o ' Injuns ' twixt here and there , an ' I hear they 've blacked their faces agin white parties , but fisheatin ' Injuns ai n't much , like Summers 'll tell you . They ai n't likely to cause much harm . " Mack raised his eyes from the ground , which he had been worrying with one finger . " We got by the Pawnees and Sioux . " " Shore . Shore . " Evans was glad when Summers spoke . It was only Summers who knew Oregon and so could speak against the man , and when he did n't it was as if he could n't because the said wordsp255were truer and wiser than he could say himself . Summers asked , " Who 's payin ' you , Caleb ? " " Now as fer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of his eye , " there 's some as hold there 's fever on the lower river , an ' this nigger ' lows there 's some but not as much as claimed . There ai n't that much , or I do n't know white from Injun . You say you aimed to take your cattle along , Evans ? " Captain Grant had gone inside . He came out with a jug and cups . It was good whisky , better than old Hitchcock sold at his store back in Independence . The captain passed it with a manner . You had to say the British had manners , if you liked manners . Evans did n't know how McBee had kept quiet so long , unless it was because of Tadlock . He rolled a swallow of whisky around in his mouth and gulped it down and spoke up . " ' Y God , " he said with the bright look of a man expecting a second to his motion , " I did n't set out for the West hopin ' to live hard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't let this nigger scare you off , " Greenwood told him . " You ai n't got more'n eight hundred miles or so to go . Could be you 'll do smart . " He emptied his cup with a throwbackof his head . " An ' then you can say you seen all them dead Injuns down from the Dalles , too . Man , it 's a sight to see ! Dead'uns floatin ' on rafts an ' laid in pens an ' all , along with little scare-devils . You 'll never set your eye on more good Injunsthan right there . " Tadlock asked , " Was there a fight ? " " Not as fur as this nigger knows . They just up and die , I reckon . Eh , Cap'n ? " Grant had seated himself with the rest . He nodded his big , British head . " Starvation and fevers , I suppose . I never stopped to think . At any rate it was n't a fight . " " As fer cattle , " Greenwood went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ git there . There 's a heap of cattle bein ' drove from Californy to Oregon . " There was sorrow on Brother Weatherby 's face , sorrow , Evans guessed , from the cursing that he heard . He guessed , too , that it was more to get God into the open than to argue withp256Greenwood that he said , " We 're in the Lord 's hands , remem-ber . " " Now that 's good , " Greenwood answered . " That there is smart . There 's places you need prayer . Ai n't nothin ' like a good prayer-sayer from here to Oregon City , I allus say . " " Are there markets in California ? " Tadlock asked . " Well , if you want to talk Californy , there 's no trouble about markets , stiddy markets , wheat a dollar and corn fifty cents and sheep a dollar or two . " " Who buys ? " " Hudson Bay Company , H. B. C. , of Here Before Christ , that 's who . Git to the ports , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makin ' up cargoes to go with what they found in Oregon . " " Whose beaver you earnin ' , Caleb ? " Summers asked again . Tadlock had another question . He put it before Greenwood got around to Dick 's . " I suppose they need men in California ? " Greenwood studied Tadlock with eyes the years had crowded around . Watching him , Evans thought he was a wise and tricky old varmint who would know how to play to Tadlock . He felt suddenly glad that Greenwood had n't been on hand when the train pulled in yesterday but had just showed up today from a hunting trip or someplace . Give him time , and he would talk everyone into California , especially the women . " Now as to that , " Greenwood answered Tadlock , " she needs good men all right , and no denyin ' it , but not just anybody . There 's too many by-jesus anybodies everywhere to this coon 's way of thinkin ' . Needs ' em , I reckon , more'n Oregon does . Oregon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What about the Mexicans ? " " Them Spaniards ? They 're all right . Leave ' em their blackrobesand the Pope , and they 're right as Irish . Same time , I look fer to see Californy white men 's country . " " And that 's why you 're eggin ' us on ? " Evans put in . The old man spread his hands as if to show the all of him , heart and gizzard and mind and all . " You 're readin ' the sign wrong , son . Ai n't I said Oregon 's all right ? But if so be it you point Californy-way , that 's all right , too . An ' it ai n't no harmp257to think it belongs with the States . This nigger do n't reckon you 're goin ' to Oregon just so 's to be British ? " It was a good question , Evans thought , honest-seeming and with a point to it . Captain Grant stirred at the words . " There are worse things than being a British subject . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Every man to his mind , Cap'n . Every nigger to his nation . " " And whativer is wrong with the Irish ? " Daugherty asked , pricked out of his silence by the old man 's words . " Niver a thing , " Greenwood said back . " Niver a by-jesus thing . " " And you 'll lead a train to the Sacramento ? " Tadlock asked . Already , Evans knew , his mind was making up  --  and it was all right . Let Tadlock go , for he could n't stand the Oregon train now he was n't captain and had been whipped to boot . And let McBee go . Let him and his family go , and Mercy that Brownie had started to shine around . Let Brewer and his thick head go . The train did n't need numbers for safety any more . Old Greenwood rubbed his hands and said , " Well , I don ' know as you could call it a train . This nigger 's got a busted wagon or so , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around a day or a dozen and see does any of the companies follerin ' in your dust want to jine with me . There 's a few early birds already has said yes ? " " I still say Oregon , " Evans told him , and looked around to see what answer the words brought to the faces . " Shore . Do n't blame you a mite . You 're big and stout . I bet you git there . An ' prob'ly you 'll like it . I know folks as does . Course , for the weak and ailin ' , I got to say maybe Californy 's better , for the way 's short and easy and ' pears like no one ever dies there . " " Damn if I ca n't believe that , " Summers said . " What was it you heerd Lewis and Clark say to their mammies ? " Greenwood laughed an easy laugh . " You ai n't so far wrong , young'un , but do n't git it into your head I 'm done fer . Whisky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sayin ' the Snakep258ai n't a by-jesus river , Dick , ner the Columbia , ner that a man do n't go froze for meat and water ? " " Nup . Who 's payin ' you , Caleb ? " " Glad you asked me that . It 's a honest question and desarvin ' of a honest answer . Cap'n John Sutter down in the Sacramento valley , he figgered maybe some would want to come his way  --  not throwin ' off on Oregon  --  and he says , Caleb , here 's a little piece of money fer your old age , and why n't you traipse to Hall so 's to show any poor folks the way ? ' There 's a good man , and one to make you welcome . " Evans said , " Tell him I 'm obliged , but that them that goes with me will go to Oregon . " Patch nodded to the words , and Daugherty and Mack and Gorham and Weatherby , and he understood with a little gush of good feeling that they were committed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't quite know . Was it just because they 'd got their necks bent ? Was it because they mistrusted Greenwood and kind of dislikedCaptain Grant , him being British ? Was it because the thought of change just did n't set with them ? It did n't matter . " I figger we 'll make it , " he said . Captain Grant 's voice had in it a touch of dander and a touch of giving up . " You Yankees will do whatever you set out to do , I suppose . " " We kin try . " " What is it you aim to do with the cattle ? " Greenwood asked . " Swim ' em . Did n't I tell you ? Swim ' em down from the Dalles . " Summers stood up . Evans saw then that Brownie had come into the fort and stood back from the circle . He thought he saw trouble in the boy 's face until he told himself it was just the darkening twilight putting shadows there . " Want me , boy ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to Dick . " Before Summers went to Brownie and walked with him to the big gate and disappeared outside , he grinned at Greenwood . " Caleb , them California beans sure work up a blow . " Chapter Twenty-Four  | BROWNIE 'S SAD-EYED , half-hound dog was waiting by the gate . He gave a slow wag of his tail as Summers and Brownie came out and fell into step behind them . " That your dog or your pa 's , you figure ? " Summers asked . He went on when Brownie did n't answer . " Or maybe Mercy McBee 's . I see lie 's claimin ' her , too . Where 's this hoss wants to see me ? " Brownie walked on , silent , away from the fort . " Where you say he 's at ? " " Dick ? " " Uh-huh . " Brownie shuffled to a stop . He slid his eyes up to Summers and down to the ground . " You got time to talk to me ? " " Sure , boy . Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I got no business botherin ' you , I reckon . " " You catched a party that loves to palaver . Jus ' name your subject . " Brownie 's lips tried a word or two , not making any sound . Not until then had Summers noticed the worry in his face . " This is poor ground for talk , I 'm thinkin ' . Too all-fired open . Let 's set somewheres . " Brownie nodded . " Me , now , I ca n't hardly think to speak unless it 's by water or a tree . River ai n't so far . " Summers had thought maybe the boy would loosen up , walking , but he did n't . He just lagged along , his head bent as if from the weight in it . It could be he was waiting for the dark that was settling on the land . Words sometimes came easier when the mouth that made them could n't be seen working . They passed a Shoshone lodge , and a fat-faced squaw watched them as if sight was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran out growling and held up at Rock 's fierce answer . " Glad you come and got me , " Summers said . " It tired my tailp260to hear of Greenwood talk of this an ' that , as if naught but a cross of bird and beaver could make it to the Willamette . " Brownie asked without interest , " Is that what he was sayin ? " " Roundabout . Caleb always comes up from behind . He snorted some of them hosses , too . " " Nothin ' skeers you , I reckon , Dick , nor frets you . " " A heap of things , but not Greenwood . " They came to the river where the bank was open and sat down by it . Brownie picked up a piece of dead branch and tossed it in the water . It stayed in sight for a minute , and then the dark roll of the river took it . Rock sniffed along the shore , and , out of sight in the falling night , a fish leaped clear and smacked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on in a fix , " Summers said , " but they ai n't like bufller . That 's a trouble with Oregon , no huffier to speak of . " For all the answer he got , he might as well not have spoken , but he let his voice run on , thinking words would lead to words . While he talked , he wondered what was in the boy to make him act so heavy . Nothing much , maybe . Young ones could build a pimple to a peak . " One day you 'll want to foller up the Snake . That country 's some , now , Jackson Hole and the Tetons and all , and Henry 's Fork and the Yellowstone close by , that we used to call the Roche Jaune from the French . It 's high land , top of the world , and pinched up so that water runs nigh any way you face . There 's snow on her , and b'ilin ' springs , and thunder underground . You best be thinkin ' about a trip to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not now . " " No ? " " I been thinkin ' on marriage . " The words came tight , the leanness of strain in them . " Ai n't nothin ' wrong with that . " Now that night had decided to set in , it had set in quick . From the corner of his eye Summerscould see just the dim white of Brownie 's face and the outline of his body , the shoulder slacked and the head downturned . " I do n't know the answer to it . " Here was a spot for silence , Summers figured . Silence was the best come-on.  | " I did n't know no one but you to come to . " Summers picked a grass stem and nibbled at it while he waited . There was the taste of fall in it already , the taste and toughness of fall . " Maybe I got no rightful business talkin ' , to you or anybody . On'y I had to talk . " The night had taken in the far shore , so that land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkness and smelled around them and snuffed away , following a trail in the grass . " This ca n't git out , Dick . " " I allus forgit to tell . " " I would n't be tellin ' myself , except for thinkin ' you could help me to the answers . " " It 's yes or no , ai n't it ? " " There 's other things . " Answers , Summers thought while he waited . Brownie wanted answers . Always people wanted answers , the full and final , everlastinganswers , not learning that answers answered only for the time , and none too well at that . His mind followed the idea along . What seemed true and right today was changed tomorrow . It all depended . On time and age and accident , and were your bowels all right . Brain and bowel went together , brain and bowel and body heat and the dream dreamed the night before . The brain made up its mind according but gave the credit all to self , standing high and prideful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking would n't be thought but for some outside partnership . " Supposin ' , Dick  --  ? " " Just supposin ' . " " Supposin ' there was a girl , and a man aimed to marry her if she said yes ? " Again Summers held his tongue and waited for the tight , hard-spoken words . " Supposin ' he found out somethin ' about her ? " " I 'm follerin ' . " " And might be she would have a baby ? " " Found out from who ? " " From her . And she did n't know if she cared for him and shep262did n't know if she did n't , but she had to marry up with someone ? " Beyond the leanness of the tone , Summers caught a cry that stirred him the more because it was held in , the cry of hurt , the cry of not-understanding , the cry for help , the cry for answers . " What about the man that done it , Brownie ? " " Goddam him , Dick ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Easy , hoss . " " Or tell the train and see him whupped for it . " " Easy . " " You think I wo n't ! " " I think you wo n't . " " Whatever do I do , Dick ? " " Might as well lay it open . I know it all but for the man . " " It 's Mack . " " Was n't none of my business to ask , Brownie . The who of him do n't make no difference . Let 's think on it . " Summers searched for what was right to say . He tried to put himself in Brownie 's place , tried to put there the him that used to be , not the him of now , worn hard and doubtful by the knocks of living . You could n't tell a boy how few were the things that matteredand how little was their mattering . You could n't say that the rest washed off in the wash of years so that , looking back , a man wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dreams dreamed and the hopes hoped and the hurts felt and the jolts suffered , they all got covered by the years . They buried themselves in memory . Dug out of it , they seemed queer , as a dug-up bone with the flesh rotted off of it might seem queer to the dog that had buried it . And the rules that people set and broke and suffered from in the breaking ? Like the rule against naturalness that animals had more sense than to deny ? Like the rule that a girl could n't lie with a man unless a preacher said amen ? Big as it was now , how big would the lying seem to Brownie when the years had rubbed the fuzz off of him ? How would Mack seem then ? A man was a man by the nature of him and , grown up , knew himself in secret for what he was , unless he had an extra-sore religion . When a chance came , he took it , or , not taking , thought he wasp263half a fool . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starryheadedthat he shook his head and laughed , thinking of the good things he had missed . Into the silence Summers said , " She did n't have to tell you , Brownie . " No matter , though , what the grown man learned , the dream was in the boy , like a green , high-growing shoot , the dream of goodness and happiness and never-ending love and true , right meanings . When a man lost it , he lost something that went to make life worth living . He lost something good , if foolish , and half his grown-up scorn of it came out of disappointment and half came from the buried doubt that the man was equal to the boy . So let the dream be dreamed , Summers thought . Let the shoot stand . He would n't cut it down , even if he could . Let time do it . Let life do it . It was work too dirty for a man . " She did n't have to tell you , Brownie , " he said again . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And she could 've made out she took to you , ' stead of sayin ' she did n't know . " " Maybe she never will take to me . " " I ai n't in doubt about that . " The boy 's voice had a kind of eagerness in it . " Ai n't you , Dick ? " " Not a mite . " The voice sank back . " Even so , I do n't know . A man do n't like less than what he 'd hoped . " No , thought Summers , leaving the words unsaid , a man did n't like to take less than he had hoped , but he had to take it . Maybe that was the big lesson , maybe that was all he 'd learned and all that anyone could learn  --  always settle for half . " Kin you git along without her , Brownie ? " " I do n't feel so . Do n't feel like I ever could . On'y  --  on'y  --  " " There 's your answer then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Closer than his fool thought , closer than the wide ranging of his mind , there it was , plain as day . There it always had been , and he had seen it from the first but still had passed it by . " How is it , Dick ? "  | " By God , take her ! " " You mean it ? " " An ' never hold agin her what she 's done . Put it out of mind . She 'll make a smart wife . " " You think she 's all right , do n't you , Dick ? " It was confidence the boy wanted , and Summers tried to give it to him , saying , " Goddam it , why you ask a fool question like that ! She 's tip-top . She just ai n't been favored in her pa or ma , and maybe thought what was the use , or maybe was carried beyond herself just because a nabob played up to her . Forgit , and take her , and count yourself lucky . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Brownie , and Summers moved to get up , made uncomfortable and sorehearted by the tone of it . " That 's all . Let 's go . I done forgot what you told me . " " Did n't aim to be a baby . It 's just what you said . " " Le 's go ! " " And what if there is a baby ? " " It ai n't hard to take up with a baby , no matter whose . " Brownie got to his feet . " I got to tell Pa that I 'm marryin ' . " " Lije 'll be all right . He thinks just of you . " " I know't . I 'm thankful to you , Dick . " " No cause fer it . " " Here , Rock ! Where 'd that dog go ? " " He 's foolin ' around somewheres . " " Maybe to see Mercy . " Walking back , Summers thought how mixed up was a man . Here was a bad thing , and he knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl 's grave face and the young and rounded lines of her , he could understand , with Mack , how the thing had come to be .   LIJE EVANS kicked his horse out ahead of the train , which was readying to roll . The wagons were supplied and repaired . The gab was gabbed . The marriage was done . So come on ! Get started ! Time to move . Ca n't spend the livelong clay on a wedding and a lost dog . Snow 'll be flying in Oregon before you know it . Follow along , Mr. and Mrs. George Brown Evans ! He set himself in the saddle and kicked Nellie again . The day was gray , and the wind blew cold , and it might rain before night , the driving , small-dropped rain that was different from a shower . Good day for a wedding . Good day for one wedding , anyhow . Good day to hook up with a McBee . But there was n't any point in stewing , or any point in thinkingmore . The milk was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life ahead and the house he would build or about California and the folks who 'd stayed behind to follow Greenwood  --  Tadlockand Brewer and Davisworth , and here was McBee in his thoughts again , in-law Hank McBee and his inlawbrood . There was one thing , anyhow : he would n't have to put up but with one McBee . The picture was n't all black . There was a little lining on the cloud , like on the blown rain cloud ahead . He had cut McBee off when , just before the wedding , McBee had shown he might change his mind about going to California . " Never can tell what 'll happen , " McBee had said . There was a flicker in his muddy eye that Evans took for an invitation to be asked to trail along . " Pret ' near wisht I had n't quit the train . " " Prob'ly you 'll like it in California . " " Oh , sure , sure . That 's a good girl your boy 's gettin ' . Like I was sayin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Evans thought , P267with a return of the old dislike  --  " you never can tell what 'll happen . " " Ca n't tell . " Evans moved away and figured he 'd done right . I t was n't that he shied off from the help that McBee would always need ; he was n't a chinchy man , he hoped . It was just that McBee was McBee and his woman his woman , and no worth to either of them . Fine thing to have them around ! Meet my in-law , Hank McBee . There 's a face , I reckon , behind them whiskers , and what passes for a man inside them clothes . Evans looked back of him and saw the train lining out at last and Dick Summers riding by the lead team , understanding , Evans knew , that sometimes a man wanted to be alone and wear himself in to a hurtful fact . He did n't guess the McBees felt hurt . Like as not they welcomedthe sudden news about Brownie and the girl , for it meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that Mercy earned her keep . She helped with the meals and managed the younger ones and often drove the team and never grumbled that he had heard about . Likely her ma and pa were tickled , though , to join up with a family that kept their noses wiped . Evans yanked his hat tight and cocked a shoulder against the wind , telling himself that what he could n't help he could n't help . So forget it . And forget Brownie and last night and his own arguments that came to nothing . Spent wind , that 's all they were . " Marry ! " he had said , unbelieving . Brownie had been waiting in the darkness at the gate , after the talk with Greenwood , and had drawn him off to tell him . " That 's what I aim to do , Pa . " " Marry ! When ? " " Mornin ' . " " To who ? " " You know . To Mercy . " " Well , now , wait  --  look , boy  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It 's decided . " Brownie never had talked to him like this , never had taken a stand and stated it so thin- and stubborn-voiced as if no words P268could budge him . Evans found himself wishing for light , so he could see the boy 's face and the boy could see his . In the dark they were just two voices . He grabbed at what came to mind . " Them McBees  --  old Hank , now  --  " " It ai n't him I 'm marryin ' . " " That 's what you think ! " " It do n't matter , anyhow . " " You talked to him ? " " Not yit . " " Or the girl ? " " She 's waitin ' . " " She know her ma and pa 's goin ' to California ? " " That do n't matter , either . But I wo n't be marryin ' of Hank then , like you said I would . " " You ai n't but a long seventeen . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Ca n't get a license here . Ca n't do it proper . " " We kin sign a paper , I reckon , and there 's Brother Weath-erby . " Everything he said , it seemed to Evans , was made to turn against him . He tried to fight down the anger that grew out of his helplessness . " Just wait 'll we git to Oregon , and if you feel the same then , we 'll do it up right . " " Unless I marry her , she wo n't be goin ' to Oregon , for you said her fambly was n't . Anyhow , I ai n't willin ' to wait . Neither of us . " " You been talkin ' to Dick . I seen you go out with him . " " Do n't hold it agin him , Pa . It was bound to come . " " How you know this girl is what you want ? Do n't hardlyknow her but to pass the time of day . " " Do n't say nothin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . She 's all right , an ' more'n that . It 's just you ca n't see her for her fambly . " " Cats breeds cats . " " Please , Pa ! " " That 's the way it is . " " Do n't say nothin ' to come between me and you ! " P269Evans asked what he would n't have asked if he had had timeto think . " You mean it 's her over me ? And over your ma ? " The answer was a long time coming , but it came solid . " IfI got to choose . " Evans made himself hold silent . Out of the thoughts that ran inside his head , he tried to catch a good one , one good enough to make the boy consider . While he tried , anger died in him , leaving just its ashes . " You owe it to your ma to talk to her , Brownie . " " I got to see Mercy . " " Not meanin ' you wo n't talk to Ma ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but I 'll talk to her . " " There 's no changin ' you , I reckon ? " " I 'm sorry , Pa , and sorrier it riles you . " " It 's you I 'm tryin ' to think of . " " Then do n't be upset . I 'm doin ' what I want . " " I ca n't feel you 're sure of that . " " I 'm sure . " " You fixed things up with Weatherby ? " " Not yet . " " And got no tent or anything ? " " We kin sleep out , or under a wagon . " " Just married and sleep under a wagon ! " " Well  --  " Evans found himself hurrying to say , " Never mind , " knowingby the boy 's voice that he was mortified and being somehow mortified himself . " We 'll make out somehow . " " If nothin 'll hold you , I 'll trade for a tent . " " Pa ! " " You 're a man now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye to see it , rememberin ' baby days . An ' I 'll see Weatherby if you 're still sot come mornin ' . " Evans turned away , feeling heavy-footed . " Where 's Rock ? " " He went off somewheres . " Thinking back , Evans could n't make up better words than those he 'd said . There was n't a word that would have stopped the wedding , no word or way or reason , unless it was the out-P270right no he could n't bring himself to use . The boy would n't be drawn back from where his will had taken him . He would n't come to call any more than Rock would . Where in tarnation was the dog ? Evans glanced behind him , half expecting to see Rock loping up , but all he saw between him and the train was the grass running patterns before the wind . He was n't anxious , though , not very , for Rock would show up in course of time . Probably he had come on a bitch in heat , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long , from night before to going on to noon . Maybe , Evans thought , he should have hunted more , but the morning already was halfway gone , thanks to the wedding , and the company had to roll out miles . And he hated to own up to it , but he had felt a little foolish and exposed , whistling around the fort and by the outside of Indian lodges while Tadlock looked on , smiling wise , as if to say I told you , way back at the start , that dogs would hold you up . It was n't Tadlock that forced him on , though . It was time and time a-passing and last night 's talk of snow , and he already sore inside at what his boy had done . The dog would turn up . That 's what he had told Brownie , who was n't so carried off by marriage as to forget about old Rock , and that was what he looked to happen . Rock would just turn up , his mouth open in what went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meantime the train must move . You could n't ask the folks to keep on waiting just for a misplaced dog , no matter if the dog was Rock . Evans slid over in the saddle and cocked the other shoulder to the wind . Except for the weather coming at him , a man would n't think that hard miles lay ahead . The road looked pretty open , as if swift crossings and rough mountains were just dreamed up in Greenwood 's head . Three hundred miles to Boise , or something close to that . More by way of Walla Walla , which way they would n't go since Summers said it was n't needful . Eight hundred miles to the home they had n't seen . Eight hundred to the new life . Giddap , horse . Take away the gray sky , take away the wind , and things looked gentle  --  cattle grazing , horses grazing , a bunch of In/dains bound for Hall , their horses dragging poles on which their goods were loaded , green grass growing , tall grass growing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was here , and the wind , and they put a man in mind of winter . Winter would be along soon . The smell of it was in the air , like the smell of a thing out of sight , beyond the bend . It made a man feel half like saying enough , half like staying the season out in the grassy Fort Hall bottoms and maybe staying longer . Cattle could be grown here , and horses , and probably crops , though not a spade of earth had been turned ; and the Indians would get over beingmeddlesome and pecky . Just what pushed people on ? Evans asked , and did n't bother thinking why , for reasons seemed no good today . It was enough to answer that Oregon had put a spell on them . It had put a spell on all of them except for Tadlock and Davisworth and Brewer and McBee except for one McBee , and he would try to act like real kinfolks to that one McBee like Rebecca told him to . Rebecca had taken the news quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't argued that he knew of , or scolded , or asked Brownie to wait . She had talked with him a long time , while Evans kept himself away , not trusting himself to speak more about it . He had gone to bed finally and had heard their voices a piece off from the tent just as a murmur . Rebecca did n't speak when she first came back but undressed quietly and came to bed and by and by put her hand on his shoulder , knowing somehow that he did n't sleep . " Maybe it ai n't the way I might hope , Lije , " she whispered so that Brownie would n't hear . " It ai n't the way I 'd hoped . " " But still it might turn out to be . You hold yourself in , Lije . " " I told him if he was sot , all right . " " I recollect when you was young . Think on it , Lije . " " I got me a real woman . " " Might be he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge too quick . " " Seems like you think it 's just fine . " Her hand patted him . " We got to take what comes and make the best of it and not the worst . You be nice to her . "  |p272What  chafed him was he knew that she was right . He said , " I 'd just as leave not talk tonight . I 'm tired , and cranky too , I reckon . " But in the morning  --  it was just this morning , come to think of it  --  what worried her was what the girl would wear . Women were queer sometimes , even Becky . It turned out the girl was dressed all right . Had shoes on and a dress with a frilly collar . And she had twisted her hair up in a way that made her face look frail . And pretty . Prettier than ever . There was no denyingthe girl was pretty . Weatherby had done the trick quick , knowing the train must move , but still the knot was likely tight enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been pleased at a marrying , maybe because it was the opposite of the funerals he had had to preach , promising life instead of marking the end of it . How did it go ? What God hath joined together , let no man put asunder ? The picture of the wedding stood in Evans ' mind as he hunched into the wind that got inside his clothes and felt around his ribs  --  the men and women gathered in the Fort Hall yard , so 's to be in shelter , and a few favorite Indians with them , wondering at the white man 's medicine , and Brownie standing stiff and the girl indrawn and pale , and Weatherby asking in his preacher 's voice if one took the other , come hell or heaven , and Ma McBee crying and her eyes red and her nose sharpstandingbetween , and McBee acting important , as if , ' y God , except for him there would n't be any such big doings as now . It was a friendly train , except for one or two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get to Oregon , they had promised , and we 'll have a housewarmin ' as is a housewarmin ' . Mack had even tried to give a yoke of oxen as a wedding present , and Brownie had refused it , acting not polite enough , as if the gift would show he could n't come it by himself . So it was done , and there was winter in the air , or the foretasteof it . By the time it came , God willing , he would be in Oregon and have a cabin building . He could imagine himselfp273in it . He was sitting in it , and a fire was burning in the new fireplace , and outside the rain pattered or the snow flurried or the wind whined , and he was safe and snug , planning what to do when the storm let up . There he was , and Becky with him , and Brownie . And Mrs. George Brown Evans , who had been Mercy McBee . You remember the McBees ? Flanks of homespunhung from the walls , and gourds sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was the smell of roasting meat in the cabin , making Rock look hungry , and the sweetness of cookies , or was it bread a-baking . Right smart house we built , eh , boy ? It 'll do to keep the weather out . ' Member that wind leavin ' Fort Hall ? ' Member how chill we was ? Makes this time real cozy , eh ? He sat in the cabin while he rode his horse , and he saw a thing far off , toward the touch of land and sky . A dead buffalo , he thought it was from the size of it , or more likely an elk or a cow or ox , and maybe not dead but only sick or resting . He studied it while his mind sat rocking in the new house on the Willamette . There were some skins on the wall , a bear that Brownie had brought down and a deer hide with the red of the fall woods in it . Come decent weather and we 'll build you a cabin , Brownie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly wait on weather to start all the work that nudges to be done . The thing would n't be as big as a cow , he saw now . Even on a gray day you could n't trust your sight in country where a lark loomed hefty as a hen . Lying on the open flat where the wind could tear at it , the thing seemed lonesome . It made the world seem lonesome . The could-be of it pinched him suddenly , and he pulled his horse up , not ready to believe , while his eyes said no and yes . They found the legs , the trunk , the head , the white-sprigged hair and put them all together . " Rock ! " he said into the wind . " Hey , you , Rock ! " He heeled his horse into a walk . He sat still in the saddle when he had come to him , seeing , and numbed by seeing , the big head knocked in and one eye pushing from its socket and the old muzzle stained by blood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p274He  took the sights in , one by one , but what he saw was Rock , the sprawly pup , Rock back at home and Brownie just a pup himself and the two growing up together , making the place cheerful with barks and cries and playful fracases . What he saw was Rock with age coming on him and wisdom in him and the graying muzzle resting on his knee . He climbed down from the saddle and stooped and lifted a paw and knew by the stiffness of the lift that this was not a fresh-done thing . Feeling ran far off from him , as if at something old in memory , while his mind worked at the how and why and who . He remembered Tadlock and his smile and looked back toward the fort and saw the ox train winding slow , a mile or so away . But it was n't Tadlock . For all his faults Tadlock was too much a man for this . Who , then ? He did n't need to ask again . He knew as well as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen . " The flicker in the muddy eye . They were McBee 's way of letting him know , of making sure he would n't miss the knowing . They were the last laugh . They were the getting even for all the wounds to little pride . And he had taken them for something else , disrememberingthat he had warned himself to look out for sneaky tricks . He brushed the bug off the mouth , feeling the blood hard and crusted against his knuckles . He closed the fist afterwards and studied it , recalling what it did to Tadlock , and he looked back again and saw the train still winding . He could n't see the fort from so low on the ground , but it would be there , it and Hank McBee . In-law Hank McBee . But anger was n't in him yet , but just the far-off sorrow , and he waited for a what-to-do while his mind worked on to put the case together . McBee had thought it safe to do the deed , since he was parting from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , his mind made up for California , and seen the old dog dozing by his wagon , waiting for Mercy to come back from somewhere , and the scheme had broken on him like a sudden light , and he had used a hammer or an ax heel or ap275club and had put the dead dog on a horse and packed him out and clumped him down where any eye would see . And then he had ridden back , smiling in his whiskers , thinking likely Evans would n't turn around , once started with the train , to push a point there at the fort that he had no proof about . " Never can tell what 'll happen " ? What did that add up to ? McBee was too sly to catch himself on words . It could even be , I ' vans thought without believing , that McBee was trying to excuse himself this morning , trying to say he 'd 've acted differentif he 'd known about the marriage at the time . So what to do ? Go back and fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revenge old Rock , who 'd been done in through no offense of his ? Fight , and let the thing be known ? Then what about Brownie and his new-wed wife and the damage possible to them ? Brownie would n't blame her for a deed done by her pa , but still they 'd know the shadow of it , both of them , and feel poor-mated , maybe , if their fathers fought . Evans straightened up . The train had crawled closer , and there was just one thing to do . A poor thing but the best . Brownie must n't ever know , or Mercy or even Becky or anyonebut him and Hank . He brought the horse around between him and the train and picked up Rock 's stiff body and placed it across the saddle and got on behind , shielding it from any gaze that was sharp enough to see . Down toward the river there was a thick patch of woods . He rode to the far side of it and got off and carried the body deep inside and laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he said out loud , not caring if the words were foolish . He looked back afterwards and saw Rock did n't look quite comfortable and turned around and straightened out a leg . Outside the woods the wind was blowing rain . Chapter - - - - - Twenty-Sixp276IT SEEMED to Evans now that one day was like anotherand that all were bad . They were all work and worry and weariness , and dust and sun and wind and night and sun again and work again . He tried to whistle up the old , bold hope , but it had disappeared . It had ground out under the grind of wheels . It had lost itself in crazy heights and depths . It had thinned away in distance . Trying for it , the eye misted . Listening , the ear filled with the dry complainings of wheels and wagon boxes . Eight miles , fifteen , eight , twenty-three . It did n't matter . This sorry land was endless . Day on day , dust on dust , pitch and climb and circle while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clattered and the wounded sage oozed out its smell . Where 's grass ? Where 's water ? Critters gant and hard to keep together overnight . Faces lank and eyes empty , or pointed suddenly , thinkingforward to the ford across the Snake . Women cross , and young ones too , and men sharp-worded through their dusted lips , quick with whip and goad on teams too tired to care . Violent country . Land of fracture and of fire , boiled up and broken when God first made the world . Range of rattlesnake and jackass rabbit and cactus hot as any hornet . Homeland of the poor and poisonous , and did Oregon really lie beyond ? Mountains near and others far , sliding in and out of sight , plaguing people for their brashness . The great gorge of the Snake , the very gut of earth , the churning gut so steep below a horseman could n't ride to it , so far a walker wore out climbingdown and back . Eight miles , twenty , twelve . And still it did n't matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try for Oregon . He had been all along . It was just that the country overpowered the mind . It was just that a man spent his hope in sweat . It was just that he could n't think ahead for watchingp277out against the here . It was partly that old Rock was dead and the place empty where he would have trotted . And partly it was Brownie 's marriage , though not so much as once , and the manner of the man and wife , as if they had to take their state ( lead serious . Why , Evans thought , when he had first hooked on to Becky he was all laugh and prank and could n't always keep his hands off her no matter if they were n't alone . No cause to take the thing so solemn even though the dog was gone . This was a time for frolic . For frolic , but for work for all . He could n't believe , back there at the fort , that the road would be so hard . For two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled to the Portneuf crossing and on il to American Falls . There were springs above the falls and ariver island that gave good grazing to the stock . But already , the remembered , the grassy bottoms of the fort had grown to sandy , sagy plains , and the Snake was scouring deep . The next day and the days that followed showed him what his mind 's eye could n't see . No one day tired the outfit out , and no one thing . Day on day did it , and sand on rock on sage on drought . The sense ofgetting nowhere did it , the feeling that the train stood still in 4 spite of straining wheels . The stingy treats of green and water , although welcome , served to make the gray miles worse . A man 's mind turned back to them afterwards , as Evans ' mind had turned back to the Raft . Here the California trail veered left , up a shallow valley toward a ragged peak a million miles away . Here Greenwood and Tadlock and their men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thought of them that kept coming to him later , while grasshoppers clattered off on dusty wings . It was the thought of water and of grass . It was the remembered munching of the stock . It was the fresh wet-nesson the tongue . He put the Raft with the marsh they 'd bedded by one night , when he had heard the tear of grass to hungry mouths , far into dreams . He put it with a campsite that the Snake made , rising from its cut . He put it with Rock Creek and with Salmon Falls . They put a cheerless hunger in him while the sunkensidedteams dragged on to the crossing of the Snake.  |p278A  river out of hell , the Snake , or a river still in hell ! A river making hell for burning souls who could n't get down to it . Summers had called him off one day , and they had teetered on the great lip of its gorge and peered below and seen it like a frothy ribbon , so lessened by its depth away that Evans had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had never seen . A fair-sized falls and fair-sized water running white , sendingup a fair-sized rumble  --  and what it was was sweep and plunge and thunder like nothing that he quite could believe . He had pulled back , dizzy , and the question inside him must have shown , for Dick had said , " We 'll ford her just the same . " Evans had asked , " We could go round the loop , like someonesaid at Hall , and so dodge both the crossings ? " " Could , " Dick said while his eyes answered no . " Just as well drown as starve , though , I 'm thinkin ' . You want to lose your last damn head of stock ? " He smiled . " The river calms down some . We 'll make it , hoss . " It was hard to think so , though , remembering how they 'd had to bed above . Once they 'd pushed the stock away from camp a mile or more and found a way down to the river more fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little grass , and they 'd left the livestock there , just lightly guarded , and had packed back water for the camp . And once , late starting after hunting wandered cows , they had camped entirely dry and found the stock more scattered in the morning . That was a thing that bothered a man  --  the thirst and growingweakness and most of all the hunger of cattle and horses and teams . Driving , a teamster saw the sagging pockets beyond the hipbones of his oxen and the chained knuckles of their backs . When he unyoked , they looked at him softly , their eyes reproachful , as if to ask how he could treat them so . And sometimes under yoke they just lay down , and no goad or whip or fork could get them up again , and a man trying felt more brutish than his brutes . They left them where they lay , with what life remained in them , thinking they had earned the slim chance of a miracle , and sometimes put plunder from the wagons with them  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every pound now counted . Leaving such , Daugherty hadp279scratched a sign and posted it close by for travelers coming later . It said , " Help yourself . " It also said weariness and the sour humor growing out of it . It said help yourself , only you ca n't , you poor devil like me , and so the joke 's on you . Coming on to good campsites , on to grass and easy water , men and women always tried to believe the hardest miles were rolled . For a little while  --  until they pulled again into the waste of sand and stone  --  their spirits lifted and their voices rang out full . That was the way of them at Salmon Falls Creek , where everything was plenty , and at Salmon Falls . Though grass and fuel were scanty at the falls , the Indians had fresh salmon and cakes of pounded berries to trade for clothing , powder , knives and fishhooks . Most of all for fishhooks , which Dick had thought to bring aplenty of . Fresh meat tasted good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff , eaten stiff or mushed up in a pot , though Evans came to feel he 'd just as soon not see a fish again if he could have red meat . And the berry cakes were better yet . Seeing the Salmon Falls Indians , Evans knew why Summers spoke so low of the fish-eating tribes . They were friendly and talkative and sometimes funny , but childish-minded and dirty and naked except maybe for a lousy rabbit skin , and they ate anything  --  lizards and grasshoppers and pursy crickets that would gag a man . They lived in huts of grass and willow that were just half-circles , open to the south . The huts reminded him of swallows ' nests , niched around the way they were , except that birds were better builders . The camp had been a good camp anyhow , or not so bad as some , no matter if grass and wood were scarce and the Indians pretty sorry . A change of victuals helped the train , as did the proof that human life of sorts could live in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solid north wall of the Snake gave the people something new to talk about . Spring after spring , there was , like sunken rivers pouring out , which Summers called the Chutes . More sand came afterwards , more sage , more rocks , more nograss , more no-water , more worn-out stock , more of the hell ofp280the Snake though they had borne out from it to cut across a bend it made . Now when they were about to come to it again , to lower down the bluff and try the ford , Evans told himself that if any train could get to Oregon , this one could . It had the best pilot that he knew of , best man and pilot both . Its stock was poor but no poorer than would come behind . Its wagons were as good as others would be by the time they reached the ford . But it was the men he counted on , the men and women and spirit of the company . They had their faults , he knew . They had their differences and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and worries in their heads , but they wished well for one another and they hung together . Here where sometimes he 'd heard the trains split up , old On-to-Oregon stayed one . Looking down the line from head to tail after the long drop to the Snake came into sight , he felt a kind of wrathy pride . Damn the Snake and all its sorry kin of sage and sand ! Damn the crossing ! They 'd make it  --  he and Summers and Patch and Mack and Daugherty and Shields and Gorham and all the rest , clear down to Byrd . They 'd make it or go down trying and still damn the Snake to do its damnedest . Once he 'd wondered if they 'd keep him captain . That was when he 'd outfought Tadlock and dared the other men to try to hang the Indian , but nothing came of it except they showed in little ways they did n't hold a grievance , maybe knowing without saying that they had been wrong . Only Daugherty had spoken open , saying , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the divil in us , temptin ' us to mortal sin . " He had grinned and added , as if to give warning that he was his own man yet , " An ' let us hope them Injuns quit their thievin ' ways , or else to hell I 'll maybe travel still . " They were for him , Evans told himself while he watched Dick coming into sight from below the brow of the bluff . They were for him and he was for them and each was for each other , and they 'd get across the Snake and pull up safe in Oregon . Summers rode alongside to say , " We can make it , I 'm thinkin ' , without hold-back ropes or anything . Steep but not too bad . "   " Hold up ! " Evans called to Patch , whose two wagons were1 in the lead ahead of him . He lifted his hand for a stop behind . The rearward wagons closed up slow and came to rest , the oxen dragging to a halt without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yoke . He said to Summers , " Maybe we better hitch a rope to the first wagon and some of us walk along , just in case . " Summers gave a nod . Evans faced down the line and yelled through his hands , " All out ! " though nearly everybody was . The call was relayed to the rear by other voices . He waited , watching , until the last of them was down . The last was Mrs. Byrd , moving heavy withdl the child in her , and it occurred to Evans , seeing her , that he might as well have let the people sit until their turns came up . He stepped down the line , motioning to the nearest men . " Mack ! Fairman ! Carpenter ! " Brother Weatherby came up with them , gray as a desert grasshopper from marching in the dust to save his horse . " Summers thinks we can drive down all right , but let 's the bunch of us walk down with the lead wagon and see how it goes . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They followed him back to the head of the column , where it Patch stood with his lead team and Summers waited to show the way . One of them had tied a rope to the rear axle . Mrs. Patch stood back with the second team , quiet as always and as always somehow noticeable . Evans thought while he spoke that you could n't throw off on these two Yankees . They were cool and heady customers . He said , " All right , Dick . You ne'en to help , Brother Weatherby . " Weatherby said , " Why not ? " as if there was n't any answer , not even his sixty-four years . 11 ! Patch popped his whip and the oxen leaned into the yoke and the wheels turned and the front ones headed down . The way was long and steep , but not so steep by Dick 's meandering that two or three men , depending on the load and team , could n't manage trouble if it came . Patch 's outfit reached the bottom without real need of help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each wagon . The plan took time and wind but worked out safe . The loosep282stock came behind , footing careful down the pitch and breakingto a heavy , stumbling run for water . Evans saw , before he went to look across the ford , that grass was scant here too . It added to his maybe-foolish load of worry to think that poor teams would make a poor out at getting through the Snake . The crossing did n't look so risky , though , being broken by two islands that sat like low rafts in the stream . " It 's far across and swift , " he said to Summers and the other men who 'd lined up along the bank , " but it do n't look so deep . " Deeper'n you 'd think , " Summers answered . " Water 's so clear it makes the bed look close . " " How deep ? " Evans glanced up at Summers , sitting thoughtfulon his horse . Summers shrugged . " Not too deep . Way to look at it is , itai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . We 'll make it . " Evans tilted his head and saw the white sun veering down . " Dick , " he said , " there 's grass aplenty on them islands . " " Plenty . " Evans spoke to the others as well as to Summers . " Let 's push the livestock to ' em and let ' em get their bellies full and then line out in the morning . They 'll be rested and fed both . " It was Byrd who answered first , saying , " Amen to that . " In his fair , ungrown-up face Evans caught the shadow of alarm , and he wondered , as before , how the man had raised the spunk to start out in the first place . He belonged in town . Summers was saying , " Good idee , " and the rest were nodding . " Let 's circle up , though maybe there 's no need of it , and git the work stock over . " While he and Brownie freed their teams , Evans thought again of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if Byrd 's weaknesses rested on him . Like some other unmanlymen he 'd known , Byrd must be a clever man in bed , judging by the flock he 'd fathered . It was vexatious to feel responsible for him , and yet he did and more so maybe than with most , remembering the words that Mack had overheard and told him . Back there at Fort Hall Tadlock was working onp283Byrd , arguing for California . Byrd had answered , " I 'll stay with Evans and Summers . If any can , those two will see the train through . " To Evans there was a kind of womanish faith in that answer that , right or wrong , seemed to put an extra burden on him . He laid the yoke down and let the team step out and saw his in-law daughter looking at him . " Wore out ? " he asked , making himself smile . She gave him just the ghost of an answering smile . " I 'm all right . " Evans was up early . The dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lightening . He stopped outside his tent and looked off to the water , seeing it as just a fluid dullness , without the shine of sun or moon or stars . The voice of it came to him , the whishing mutter of its strength . All night he 'd heard it , even through his dreams . He shook himself against the chill , against the inward funkinessof early morning , wishing with a sudden impatience that all the camp was up , ready for a try that weighed heavier with waiting . Right now , with the blood flowing weak in him after sleep and the dark cast of dawn lying on his spirit , damn if he was n't as bad as Byrd , empty-chested before a danger built up in the mind . They 'd get across , down to the last setting hen and chick . It was his being head rooster that put the foolish fidgets in him . He walked down toward the water , flushing up a ground bird that rustled out of sight . Close up , the river still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Out in the stream the islands floated like clouds made out at night . The shapeless movement that he saw might be the livestock , getting up to graze . They 'd got the stock out there all right and afterwards , after food and coffee , had made light of the crossing , saying shoo , it was n't anything . Critters now and then had had to swim and the current sure enough was swift , but still it was n't anything . And , with grass and rest , the teams would be still stronger . They 'd soon see how it was , Evans thought , while there slipped into his mind the way the river reared against the horsep284he 'd used to drive the loose stock over . The eastward sky was showing red . An hour or so , and they would see . There was just breakfast to get and eat and clean up after , and tents to strike and loads to load and the stock to push back and hitch . Then they 'd see . Except for being unloaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place allowed . By Dick 's advice the men had gone wood hunting yesterday and had found a little , mostly smallish sized . Evans had thought it next to nothing , not much more than good enough for fires , and had said to Summers , " The 'm poles would n't float a cart . " " Do n't aim to float the wagons , Lije . Not here . " " Do n't ? " " Tide 's too stiff . A floatin ' wagon might draw the teams along with it . " " So what ? " " What we want is for the wheels to set solid on the bottom . We 'll lay the wood on top the wagon boxes  --  that 'll give us extry weight  --  and h'ist the flour and such on top of it , so 's to keep it dry . " There was n't wood enough to help out much . Here and there the men had found a small and lonesome tree and here and there a piece of punky drift . They laid their pickings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get the spoilables above the waterline , used plows and pack saddles and boxes emptied into others . Evans turned away from the river , hearing sounds in camp , and saw Summers riding up . Behind him the arches of the wagons had divided from the dark . " Got ' er figgered out , Lije ? " Summers asked . " Sure . All we have to do is cross and then think about the second crossing . " " Second ai n't so bad . Close to Boise , too , where there 's help if need be . " Summers smiled while his eyes studied Evans ' face . " You sleep any ? " " Sure . " " Ai n't no sartain-sure way against accidents , Lije . If'n one happens , no one 'll fault you ' less you do yourself . "  | " I know that . " " Know it but ca n't feel it , " Summers answered , gazing off beyond the river . " That 's what makes you a good captain , I reckon , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back to Evans . " I swear , Lije , back in Missouri I never thought to see you playin ' mother hen . " " Me neither . " " Best put four yoke , anyhow , to a wagon , an ' up to six to some . " " That 'll mean usin ' some teams twicet . " Summers bobbed his head . " With a long string of critters , enough will have footin ' if others has to swim . " " I see . " " An ' , Lije , I 'm thinkin ' we need a rider at each side , upstreamand down . Up man could have a hold-rope on the lead ox nearest him . " " Down man would have a poke , I reckon . Which side is dangerest ? " " Down , I figger . Yonder there 's a ripple it would be bad to sag below . Let swimmers do the ridin ' , Lije . " " That 's a job for me then . " " You 're a fish , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat , I seen down on the Bear . " " I 'll ask him . " Summers clucked to his horse . " Thought I 'd scout acrost and find out how to go . " Evans watched the horse take to the river . He saw it splash in , unwilling but helpless under Dick 's strong hand , and brace against the sweep and feel ahead for footholds while the water rose . At one place it had to swim , and Dick lifted himself to keep from getting any wetter than he had to . They came out , streaming , on the nearer island . Evans faced around and made for camp . There was other work to do while Dick did his . The sun was above the hills by the time the train was ready . Evans had put his own wagons first in line , six yoke to the big one , four to the small , thinking it his duty to try the danger first . The other wagons curled behind his , some prepared to go ,     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
