The silence was startling . For the first time in five nightmare weeks there was no fighting in Athens . <P> Tommies in tanks had recaptured the ruins of the Averoff prison which ELAS had used as a fort . After it fell , resistance collapsed . With all but a third of the capital recaptured , reinforced British troops prepared to drive out the remnant of ELAS forces . In driblets ELAS riflemen retreated by winding paths over the hills and melted away into the countryside . Into the streets , behind them , marched British troops and Greek Government Militia , pelted by flowers from shattered windows . Said a perplexed Tommy : " Blimey , I 'll never get the hang of these people . First flowers , then bombs , then flowers again . " <P> After the soldiers came the civilians . They picked their way through ruins and roadblocks , in search of food , and firewood . In the first days of peace , soup kitchens served 320,000 meals to hungry Athenians . Against the wall of a hotel an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five days . <P> Peace by Force . Peace had been won not by the truce which the British had offered ELAS , but by military force . In a pronouncement as stiff as his mustachios , Greece 's new Premier , General Nicholas Plastiras , 62 , brusquely warned ELAS that they had better capitulate politically too . <P> Greece had chosen a Regent , * Archbishop Damaskinos ( TIME , Jan. 8 ) . The Archbishop chose as Premier Greece 's No. 1 kingbreaker , fresh from eleven years of exile in , France . Some Greeks were pleased . They remembered Plastiras as the democratic strongman who helped depose King Constantine in 1922 , King George II the following year . Other Greeks were disappointed . They remembered Plastiras ' unsuccessful attempt to seize the Government in 1933 . <P> Disarmament First . In his nine-man Cabinet , Plastiras took the four portfolios of War , Navy , Air and Merchant Marine in addition to the Premiership . Most of his Ministers were Liberals ; all but one had rightist traditions . The exception : Foreign Minister John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party in 1936 , visited Russia in 1924 at the invitation of the Russian Government . Not in the Government : representatives of EAM ( National Liberation Front ) , whose fighting arm is ELAS . Places were presumably still open for them . <P> But General Plastiras made his attitude crystal-clear : ELAS must first lay down its arms before EAM could enter his Government . Thereafter he promised : 1 ) re-establishment of democratic institutions , 2 ) free elections . He added grimly : " I hope the rebellion will end with the rebels laying down their arms . . . trusting my word that I will not allow a dictatorship . ... If not , I will naturally be compelled to clear the situation by force . " Leftish Foreign Minister Sofianopoulos ' backed his leader ; ELAS was a minority , must lay down its arms . <P> But ELAS showed no intention of doing so . It was still fighting fiercely at Patras , chief port of Western Greece . It was believed to control most of Greece . ELAS ' withdrawal from Athens looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like a Government-controlled island in a sea of ELAS hostility . There was a lull . But dirty weather might blow up again at any moment .
