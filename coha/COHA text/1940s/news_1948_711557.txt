txt A military pact binding the U. S. , Canada and Western Europe is on official drawing boards here . Its key feature  --  billions in " military lend ease " for allies of the U. S. This is the State Department 's answer to Russia 's cold war , stepped up with the blockade of Berlin . U. S. diplomats  --  aided by the Army  --  are now blocking in details of an omnibus bill . scheduled to go to Congress in January or February . As now planned it would make possible : American arms to make Western Europe strong enough to hold back the Russians in case of war until heavy U. S. forces could arrive . A string of defensive air bases along the Alaska-Greenland-Norway line in the Arctic Circle . That 's to protect the U. S. and Canada against Russian attacks across the North Pole . A close-knit U. S.-Canadian-Western Europe defense plan . It would include unified war commands , standardization of weapons , joint staff planning for war , some pooling of war resources . These points are already being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talks which have been going on for the past several weeks . Belgian Defense Minister Raoul de Fraiteur revealed in Brussels yesterday that military experts are working on " a kind of military Marshall Plan . " Story below . The diplomats may also ask Congress to guarantee that the U. S. will go to war if Western Europe is attacked  --  though this point is still being argued . The precise method of approaching Congress is subject to change . This defense plan is intended to be carried out step by step . The omnibus bill will be somewhat vague  --  intended to give far-reaching , blanket authorOfficials may even decide later to break it into fragments and submit it piecemeal ? but " lend lease " will be one of the hrst provision. , they say . The planners are counting on the mounting " crisis " with Ptissia to see the till th.ouzh Congress , regardless of which party holds power after the November electi.ms . State Department ifficials say this bill merely implements the Vandenburg resolution . passed by Congress in June . That resolution implied U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurate estimate of the potential effects of this arms program on the U. S. economy will not be possible until Europe 's military shopping lists begin to arrive several months from now . But it is already eel-tam the military " lend lease " plan  --  if voted  --  will intensify inflation in the U. S . say some of the president 's economists . It will bring its heaviest pressure on goods that are already short  --  metals , such as special steels , copper and lead : transportation equipment : fuels . The Cost This proposed military pact and allied agreements which U. S. diplomats and military men are now discussing with Canada and Western Europe would mean : 1 . A " guesstimated " $4 billion to $8 pillion in U. S. " military lend lease " during the next three to five years . Canada , Britain . France . Belgium . the Netherlands and Luxembourg would be certain recipients . Portugal . Iceland , Denmark , Greenland would probably also share So possibly would Norway and Italy . Only a few of these countries might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Approximately $1. billion to 51 5 billion would probably be needed during the first 12 months of the plan . As much as 52 billion may be asked , to provide for " a little leeway . " Most of this aid would be required for building up the ground forces of these allies ; relatively little would go for air or naval - refurbishing. 2 . In a sort or reverse lend lease the U. S. would receive rights for the joint use of air bases in cooperating countries and local aid in building them . These might include air fields in the Canadian Arctic , Greenland . Iceland , the Portuguese Azores . Libya and perhaps in Norwegian Spitsbergen inside the Arctic Circle . It would ' guarantee certain strategic raw materials to the U. S. and other allies . This reverse lend lease also would insure food and other local supplies for U. S. troops quartered in the allied countries during peacetime maneuvers or war . 3 . The U. S. and other participating nations would informally agree in advance on unified area commands in case of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff would be set up . This group would work out the role each cooperating nation would play in case of war . The U. S. , for example , would be assigned a major role in strategic air bombing : the British in jet air tactical fighting ; the French in ground artillery warfare . 5 . A joint munitions board would be set up . This group would standardize military equipment . Thus Belgian ammunition would fit British rifles and U. S. parts would fit British military trucks . War Resources . 6 . A joint war resources board would he set up . This staff would work out the economic role each cooperating country is to play in preparing for a possible war . It would recommend the economic contribution of each . It would estimate the resources of the participating countries in strategic materials , potential arms production , possible air base sites , shipping and manpower , and ask each country to contribute what it is best fitted for It might suggest . for example . that the French should manufacture a sizable chunk of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should make a large amount of machine guns for the group . that Britain should manufacture jet fighter planes for itself and some of the allies . Some countries would furnish air bases : some strategic materials . Military and political representatives of major Western European nations , with American advice , are now working out details of this European military Marshall Plan . They 're calculating what arms they need to defend themselves . They 're adding up what 's needed to modernize and expand their arms industries . They 're figuring out what each European country can contribute toward producing these arms and " updating " these munitions plants . They 're studying how to cooperate in this production so each country can contribute the materials or arms it 's best suited to turn out They 're also thinking of joint factories , the loaning of patent rights and production methods ? the exchange of information on new arms and military methods . and the joint use of military bases . When the figures are added up , the Europeans will figure out what they ca n't supply themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodities and raw materials . Then they 'll ask the U. S. to put up the dollars and the raw materials ? the semi-finished goods and the arms they ca n't turn out themselves . Due In Three Month . These figures are due in the U S. In three months . Then State Department and military officials here will go over them , pare them down and get data ready for presentation to Congress . Some of the statistics will doubtless be secret , but can be given to closed meetings of congressional committees Until these figures are here , no accurate figures well be possible on how much this rearmament of Europe will cost . bow long it will take and what goods the U. S. will be expected to furnish . But American military men . doing some guessing and some estimating on their own . are talking privately that it will take from S1 billion to $1.5 billion a year over three to five years . The rough total may run 54 billion to $8 billion , they say . They expect the Europeans to ask for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well give more and supply its own armies . without peril of inflation . Military men are n't certain of the types of equipment Europeans will want . But requests that have been pouring in from Western Europe since the end of the war and rough surveys conducted by U. S. military experts indicate needs will be mainly equipment for ground armies . Requirements will include transportation and communications equipment . heavy motorized artillery , tanks and military engineering equipment . Europe can make much of its needed light artillery ( in France ) , machine guns and rifles ( in Belgium and France ) and the jet planes in Britain ) . It can also make some of the light tanks , the radar and other communications equipment , and even some of the heavy arms . But it will need many specialized parts . . special steels ( such as armor plate ) and other raw materials to do the job . The U. S. will have to furnish many of the goods  --  or the cash to buy them elsewhere . The Same Story State Department officials point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plan . Ii 's based on " self-help " and " co-operation . " they state ? Europe doing what it can for itself and " workmg together as a team " instead of as small independent units . Most of the arms-for-Europe would be outright gifts The projected aid is tentatively being called " lend lease . " partly because officials want the Europeans to repay as much as possible in " reverse lend lease . " Officials here do n't expect great repayment . though . except that air bases might be of incalculable value to U S. defense . All repayment would be in the form of services . goods and air bases , the Europeans will be expected to repay nothing in cash . Like the Marshall Plan . the arms-for-Europe program is supposed to be so organized that Europe will be able to carry its own load alter a few years . Officials do n't make clear , though , how Europe will be able to carry this extra military load at a time when it will be setting out on its own alter four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic conviction is that Russian expansion can only be stopped if there is a balance of power in Europe- That means that Western Europe must be strong enough , economically and militarily , to make the Russians decide against armed expansion . Officials say they 're now learning that the economic Marshall Plan  --  which aims at an industrially strong Western Europe ? ca n't succeed unless the Europeans are armed at the same time . That 's because economic recovery is  --  in large part  --  a matter of morale , they say . If the Europeans are convinced that Russia will take over Western Europe , they wo n't work hard for recovery . With arms , say State Department men , the Europeans will work with confidence , and have the courage to fight communism themselves . A start has already been made on the continent Five Western European countries ? Britain , France . Belgium , the Netherlande and Luxembourg  --  early this year joined in a " Western Union " pledging military-economic cooperation . For the past several months their political and military leaders have worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's understood here , these unification discussions are still in the " talk stage " ? have n't yet reached the " decision stage . " The members are now reported divided over the problem of whom to pick for their overall military commander .
