As the ship passed , on her last voyage to the mainland , a few sentimental spectators wept . One of Hawaii 's most popular links with the mainland , she was headed for San Francisco and the auction block . In her place this week was a younger ( 1932 ) Matson ship , the 18,163-ton Lurline , making her first commercial postwar trip to the Islands . <P> The 22-knot Lurline , also a troopship during the war , had been stripped and rebuilt from the hull up . Manhattan 's Raymond Loewy Associates had designed lanai ( porch ) suites with private sundecks and air-conditioned cabins that were combination living and bedrooms . First-class fare : $150 , up to $850 for the lanai suites . <P> To refurbish the Lurline , Matson Navigation Co. had laid out close to $19,500,000 , more than twice the ship 's original cost . The heavy expense forced Matson to shelve plans for rebuilding her two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lurline was a gamble as competition from the airlines ( Pan American and United Air Lines ) has cut deeply into Matson 's business .
