Franklin Roosevelt invited Lieut . General George S. Patton Jr . to share his jeep on a review of troops in the Middle East , and the U.S. press reported the gesture . Nevertheless , the Senate subcommittee which was considering Patton 's promotion ( from his present permanent rank of colonel to permanent major general ) was unimpressed . Last week the subcommittee postponed action . <P> Held up with Patton 's were promotions of eleven other war-made lieutenant generals : <P> Mark Wayne Clark , Brehon B. Somer-vell , Joseph W. Stilwell , Joseph T. Mc-Narney , Ira C. Eaker , Carl Spaatz , Millard F. Harmon , Omar Nelson Bradley , Robert L. Eichelberger , George C. Kenney and Jap-imprisoned Jonathan M. Wainwright . Also held up were the promotions of two major generals : Thomas T. Handy and Walter B. Smith . <P> The Army 's plan for higher permanent rank for its top men , some of whom ( e.g. , Clark , Kenney , Eaker ) are still only lieutenant colonels in the regular promotion list , had hit a pesky snag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time-perhaps by the time Congress reconvenes on Jan. 10.
