The Arab world 's month-long is-he-or-isn't-he about Yahya of Yemen could now cease . In his dusty fortress capital of Sana , Imam Yahya lay dead . His successor as absolute ruler of Yemen 's 3,500,000 Bedouins and oasis-dwellers : Ahmed el Wazir , rich Mocha planter and onetime adviser to the old Imam . Two of Yahya 's nine recognized sons had somehow died the same day as their father . <P> Beyond those bare announcements , little news had crackled to the outside world over Sana 's lone radio transmitter . But there was still plenty of yackety-yack over what had actually happened in Yemen . <P> One rumor : that Yahya , who has long been ailing with hemiplegia ( paralysis of one side of the body ) , two of his sons , his Prime Minister and his secretary had been shot down by assassins . <P> Another : that just before his death the aged ( 77 ) Yahya , knowing that El Wazir hoped to grab the throne , had taken a gold hoard of $40,000,000 from the palace cellar , packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaves ) to be buried . The story went that the slaves were killed , as in Captain Kidd legends , lest they tattle ; but that El Wazir had tracked down the hoard , returned it to Sana . <P> In Cairo , Arab League Secretary Abdul Rahman Azzam Pasha heard that civil war had broken out , with three of the dead Yahya 's sons opposing the new government . The league sent a plane to buzz Yemen . It would drop 10,000 pamphlets enjoining Yemenites " to be quiet and avoid bloodshed . " <P> To find out what really went on , the league sent a two-man delegation to Yemen . They might see one change . Eagle-eyed Imam el Wazir was rather less isolationist than Imam Yahya , who once said : " I and my people would rather live in poverty and eat grass than allow foreigners to enter the country . . . . " Last week an American who knows Yemen said : " Yemen might rush into the 19th Century from the 13th. . . . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
