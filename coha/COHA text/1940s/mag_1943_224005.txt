Elder Statesman Bernard Baruch , after much pondering and consultation in his office ( see cut ) , five weeks ago submitted a report to Home Front Czar James F. Byrnes on the much muddled problem of U.S. manpower . Czar Jimmy hugged the report to his well-tailored weskit , declined to reveal its contents . Last week , chivied by suspicious Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg , Czar Jimmy reluctantly released the report . The reason for his reluctance became plain . Though many of the details had leaked out , the sharp , critical tone had not come through . <P> Said plain-talking Mr. Baruch : " Proper handling of manpower has been made impossible by the failure of Government agencies to work as a team with a clearly defined program . Measures undertaken by one agency have been undone by the conflicting actions , or inactions of other agencies . " <P> Those who insisted that the report was as significant as the famed Baruch rubber report exaggerated . Baruch , assisted by Byrnes 's consultant John Hancock , had not intended to make an overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sat down with aircraft makers* on the bench in Washington 's Lafayette Park , and there had worked out a plan to avert a disastrous slump in West Coast airplane production . His recommendations , to set up a labor budget and balance West Coast manpower with production by funneling workers into essential plants , have already been put into effect ( see p. 23 ) . But , Baruchlike , he had not stopped there , but had gone on to make many a commonsensible suggestion to ease the manpower squeeze . Some of them : <P> &gt;Draft deferments should be made on the basis of occupation rather than on family status . To draft war workers with irreplaceable skills while " leaving untouched millions of fathers not engaged in war work " would retard war production . <P> &gt;Key aircraft workers , now in the Army , should be furloughed to their old jobs . <P> &gt;Congressional investigations which interrupt , war plant routine , and the multitudinous forms which executives must fill out , should be drastically reduced . <P> &gt;Labor is being hoarded or badly utilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the incentive to reduce payrolls , should be ended . <P> But Baruch insisted once again that these , and all other measures , must be coordinated into an overall , efficiently administered plan . Then he evoked the bogeyman : " The only alternative to some plan of this sort is a national service act for the drafting of labor .
