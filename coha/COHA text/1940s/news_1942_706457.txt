txt An increase from 4 per cent to 6 per cent in the normal tax on incomes of American taxpayers was voted today by the house ways and means committee , drafting the new 8 billion dollar tax bill . The committee decided to take about 3 billions of the 8 billion dollar total from individual income tax payers . While the normal tax increase of 2 per cent will involve an added burden upon the wage earner , the real blow will fall when the committee decides upon the surtaxes to be applied . Surtaxes formerly were reserved for large incomes , but now they apply to every dollar of net income . By deciding to raise about 500 millions less than the treasury request for 3 , h billions from individual taxpayers the committee indicated surtaxes will be somewhat less than the tremendous increases suggested by the treasury . 12 to 86 Per Cent Suggested . These started at 12 per cent for the first $500 of net income and ran to 30 Per cent for the $10,000 class . Surtaxes ranging up to 86 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Net income is the amount remaining after personal exemptions and other legal deductions have been calculated . The committee already has cut personal exemptions from the present $750 to $500 for single men , and from $1,500 to $1,200 for married persons . It rejected the treasury proposal that the $400 credit for dependents be cut to $300 . The earned income credit of 10 per cent , which tho treasury asked to be eliminated , was retained by the committee . Chairman Robert L. Doughton ID- , N. C. said the committee , in several weeks of executive sessions , had studied five rate schedules ranging between the treasury proposals , which would have produced 31/2 billions in new revenue , and the committee 's own staff proposals , which would have raised 2 billion 400 millions more than the present yield . Adopt Compromise Goal . The final decision , Doughton said , was to adopt the suggestion of a committee member for a yield of 2 billion 750 million dollars . Forcing married persons to file joint returns , a per . mission which formerly permitted couples with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another 300 millions . A total therefore of 3 billion 50 million dollars is the tentslive yield of the new bill from individual returns alone . The committee has decided tentatively to increase corporation income taxes by an extra 3 billions . This leaves about 2 billion 700 million dollars to be raised from estate and gift taxes and excise taxes upon a long list of commodities , if the treasury 's goal of 8 billion 700 million dollars is to be raised . A general sales tax long has been debated as the best method of obtaining any deficit below this total .
