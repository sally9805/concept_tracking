( See Cover ) <P> In the subterranean world of petroleum , it is the international oilmen who play the blue-chip game . The players must back their gambling spirit with refineries , tankers , filling stations - and millions in hard cash . In this blue-chip game , the jackpot is the Middle East , Iraq , Iran , Saudi Arabia and the string of tiny sheikdoms in the rolling sand dunes around the Persian Gulf - Bahrein , Kuwait and Qatar ( pronounced gutter ) . <P> Under these scorching deserts lies an ocean of oil , the fabulous wealth of the Arabian Nights . The ocean contains a minimum of 26 billion barrels ( 1 times the proved reserves of the U.S. ) , a maximum of 150 billion barrels . How much is this worth ? In cash , enough to make a hundred Rockefellers ; as a military asset , as nations count , it is beyond price . <P> This jackpot has not lacked for players . <P> The Nazis tried to sweep the tables in World War II by Rommel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a year ago , lost out with their fiasco in Azerbaijan , Iran . Now Russia has raised the ante by threatening Greece and Turkey . Last week , President Truman dealt in the U.S. - in a diplomatic way - by asking for a $400,000,000 loan to Greece and Turkey , accompanied by mili tary advisers and weapons ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) . The loud talk was all of Greece and Turkey , but the whispers be hind the talk were of the ocean of oil to the south . <P> New Deck . As the U.S. prepared to make its historic move , a potent group of U.S. oil companies also came to a historic decision . With the tacit approval of the U.S. and British Governments , the companies concluded a series of deals - biggest ever made in the blue-chip game - to develop and put to full use this ocean of oil . <P> Standard Oil Co . ( N.J. ) , world 's biggest oil company , was the natural leader of the group ; as Standard 's internationally minded president , Eugene Holman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drafting the breath-taking plans . Jersey Standard and its partners were going to spend upwards of $300,000,000 in the stormy Middle East to bring out the oil . <P> As free-enterprising businessmen , their hardheaded purpose was to make money . But as internationalists , they were well aware of the political implications . By making the oil available to all the world ( Russia would be able to buy as cheaply as anyone else ) , they would do their part to clear the political air . By bringing the tangible benefits of free enterprise to the desert lands , where starvation and disease are as ever-present as heat , they would make friends and influence people where the U.S. sorely needed friends . As the London Economist summed up : " They should be offered the resources of Western technique in making their deserts once more blossom like the rose . Western democracy claims that it stands for a synthesis of enterprise , forethought and trusteeship . It will never have a better chance to prove its case . " <P> High Hand . Up till now , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . The principal players are a complex mixture of governments and private companies : <P> The oil concessions in Iran are owned by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. , in which Winston Churchill , then First Lord of the Admiralty , bought control for the British Government in 1914.
