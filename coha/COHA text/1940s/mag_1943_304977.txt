Lieut . Nicholas Kliebert , with 37 men , had gone to protect some wounded on the Munda trail . While they were holding a bridge against a frontal attack their three Browning automatics became overheated , could no longer be used . Later , in the presence of his commanding officer , Lieut . Kliebert told correspondents what happened next : " The Japs who got through to one of our litter cases propped the man against a tree and five Japs took turns bayoneting him . I got three of them . . . . We saw Japs pull blankets off litter cases and line them up . ... They cut one of the poor lads from the top of his head to his feet , meanwhile laughing deliriously . Then they shot him through the head . " <P> The battle lasted for seven hours . When the Japs finally withdrew , Kliebert had lost three of the handful of brave men who had fought beside him while others were evacuating the wounded , had killed 175 Japs . He estimated that the Japs killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not walk .
