Mrs. Susan McViddy had heard her husband say once too often before a cocktail party : " Have n't you one dress without spots ? " And after a cocktail party : " Ca n't you do something about your hair ? It is n't as if you could n't be attractive . " Susan McViddy had had enough . If she was going to keep husband and wife together , she would have to cultivate glamour . Instead of going to the market that Tuesday morning , she went to the nearest cosmetic counter and laid in twenty-five dollars ' worth of supplies . The only space she could find for her purchases was the refrigerator , minus its usual semiweekly load . On Wednesday morning she got up at six-thirty , as usual , packed the children 's lunch , rushed the two four-minute eggs to Mr. McViddy just as he was about to ask where they were , got him on the train , her children into school , herself back home . Then her real day began . Refusing to engage her conscience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumpled cushions , unmade beds . Off went her brunch coat . From under the undone mending she drew out the nightgown she had used only once when she represented the local P.T.A . at its state convention . After she slipped into the nightgown , she made a beeline for the vegetable crisper and extracted the skin softener , dry-skin cream , estrogenic preparation for fine wrinkles , eye-opener , hand whitener , finishing cream , vanishing cream , and the ten-minute mask . Half an hour later , looking like a fugitive from Madame Tussaud 's waxworks and feeling like cucumbers vinaigrette , she slid back to bed . At noon she awoke for the unveiling , with such tremors of anticipation that she hardly gave the Wednesday wash a thought . After a complete body job with hi-test skin oil , a " Bee 's Bait " bubble bath , a ten-day-diet lunch of shaved ice and beet juice , she put herself in the hairdresser 's capable hands . At two o'clock Mrs. McViddy was unrecognizable , even to herself . Deciding to make the illusion complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred dollars carefully accumulated for the mortgage payment due on Friday . Gaining boldness with beauty , she crossed the once-forbidding threshold of Mary McCray ( Custom Originals ) . At four she emerged clad in Mrs. McCray 's version of Heim 's new day-into-dusk costume , confident that at last she approximated her husband 's ideal of the perfect woman . Home again , she barely had finished a shower and quick pickup treatment when she heard the familiar voice bellowing in semihumorous annoyance : " Why were n't you at the station ? " And , when he did n't find her in the kitchen : " Hey , Suzy , where are you ? " She smiled as she headed for the stairs , already tasting triumph . Mr. McViddy needed only one look , " Who do you think you are ? a debutante ? " he said . " This place looks a mess .  | Where 's the dinner ? Is n't it ready yet ? " Mrs. McViddy walked slowly to the kitchen . A few tears rolled down the pancake make-up . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was once more Mrs. Susan McViddy , the allround American wife . It is easy enough to smile at Mrs. McViddy , but in her own way she was only trying to work out the problem of every American wife : How To Live Up to Her Husband 's Conception of What a Woman Should Be . There is some undefined quality in the American male that makes him expect as his birthright a wife with the combined attributes of every female heroine in life , history , or fiction with whom he has had even a nodding acquaintance . The worst of it is he has succeeded in convincing women noted for their gullibility that his requirements are perfectly reasonable . And once having fallen into this trap , the American wife now drives herself to achieve standards of perfection undreamed of even by her demanding husband . With daily encouragement from him , she tries to be at least nine people in one . When we take a careful look at Mr. McViddy 's nine wives , the whole problem unfolds . MRS . MOM . As soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call her " Mom " in private . He brightened the dull days of her first pregnancy with endless recollections of his mother , a heroic figure who delivered six tenpound offspring without the aid of an anesthetic and raised them to splendid manhood with never an ounce of formula . It did n't take nine months for Mrs. McViddy to realize what was expected of her . And now , with four children behind her , she is still trying to out-Mom her mother-in-law . Mr. McViddy , who is fond of saying , " We want a big family . do n't we ? " , likes his children served to him on a silver platter for half an hour each day and then whisked away beyond earshot for the remaining twenty-three and a half hours . But he is extremely generous to them and never comes home without a tricycle or a baseball bat , even if it means that Mrs. McViddy must forgo a new dress , which , he points out . she would " only stretch out of shape soon . " MRS . SUPER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembly line before he was drafted , often has remarked that " any unskilled factory worker could run a house more efficiently than you women . " He has convinced Mrs. McViddy that if she would only systematize her housework , the collars would always be turned , the socks would always be mended , there would never be spots on the clothes or woodwork , the moths would be exterminated , nothing would be mislaid , the shoes and furniture and silver would shine , the blankets would smell of fresh air and sun , and dust would be a thing of the past . In addition , she would have three hours for relaxation in the afternoon . It has n't worked out quite that way . The chores are done , but , unfortunately , not always in the noiseless and invisible fashion Mr. McViddy requires . At such times he is  | likely to say , with a mixture of pique and magnanimity , " Why do n't you stop puttering around the house and sit down for a while ? " MRS . OPEN HOUSE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his paternal great-grandmother , a Memphis belle to whom a dinner party meant two hundred people . He is convinced that Southern hospitality can ' Gloom again in the McViddy household . While most people are content to take off the screens for the winter in routine fashion , Mr. McViddy considers it a type of harvest holiday during which the master of the house serves his famous Screen Punch , a concoction that invariably leads to an " impoverished " dinner for the twenty closest neighbors , a friendly poker game , and a three-course bite " at midnight . Mrs. McViddy 's emergency shelf is always stocked with a variety of snacks ? from a five-course steak dinner ( for six friends her husband happens to bring home one evening when three of the children are down with chicken pox ) to an ever-normal granary of brunches , lunches , and teas . If , after an unusually heavy run on this shelf , Mrs. McViddy begs for a breather , she is likely to hear about Helen , a girl : n the office who thinks nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says Mr. McViddy , " She works all day , too ! " MRS . GOURMET . Mrs. Gourmet and : ter blueberry pies are what Mr. McViddy and every American boy fought for in : he last war . It started innocently enough , . n the early days of their marriage , when Mr. McViddy remarked that his mother as marvelous at noodles . Ever since that day , Mrs. McViddy has unselfishly dedicated herself to her husband 's palate . She started modestly with biscuits every morning and pie every night . In a year she had graduated to herbs and wine and could hold her own in a conversation on the merits of marjoram vs. basil . When she finally perfect . d poulet au vin ordinaire du pays ( with its own eggs ) , and served it to Mr. McViddy , an unaccustomed sparkle in her eye in anticipation of the accolades it would bring , he took one taste and said , " This reminds me of Mother 's hamburgers . Where 's the catchup ? " MRS . EVE . Mrs. McViddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivaling Cleopatra was no longer required . She was wrong . True , she might upsweep a chignon of ten years ' standing without eliciting a word of comment from Mr. McViddy . But every now and again he would really look at her , and for that split second he would expect to find her as ravishing and entrancing as she seemed to him the moment he fell in love with her . So , like a conscientious schoolboy who each night prepares his lesson perfectly although his chances of being called on to recite are only one in fifty , Mrs. McViddy must be on the qui vive beauty-wise seven days a week . MRS . BOOSTER . Mr. McViddy , in his mellow moments , likes to say , " I owe it , all to the little woman . " But behind her public smile of appreciation , she ca n't I help thinking she has earned this coinpliment with blood , sweat , and tears . There was the time that Mr. Jones , a  | potential client , came to town with his family for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , and so did the fraternal brothers . Mrs. McViddy never objected to cultivating : he current wives of her husband 's superiors , but it was often hard to persuade . he children that " the bosses ' kids " should be allowed to win at jacks . And when Mr. McViddy opened an electricalappliance store , she grew extremely weary of having her home used as a demonstration center and doing the community 's laundry ? " just to show them : low . " FIRS . BUDGET . Mr. McViddy , although man of modest circumstances , does n't eke to say " We ca n't afford this , " and he sees no need to , because he can cite any number of women who , with nothing more than a little taste and inzenuity , have made shrines to Queen Victoria out of cold-water flats . His favorite example is Mrs. Bullfinch , who contrived a coffee table eight feet square cy the simple expedient of placing a secondhand ton of marble on curled iron legs salvaged from old school desks . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife to produce such items as a piano , a new oil burner , a television set , and a pair of Bristol vases from her weekly food allowance . On each occasion Mrs. McViddy has delivered the goods without starving her family or disgracing the McViddy name . But getting things wholesale and rummaging through dusty attics in search of the ironstone pitcher Mr. McViddy wants for Father 's Day have begun to pall . And she has a recurrent dream in which she walks into an ordinary department store and buys a Brand-new mahogany end table at the asking price . MRS . BLUE RIBBON . Mr. McViddy ates nothing more than just a plain housewife who never gets out and does sings . When Mrs. McViddy taught the : children how to swim , he did n't see why the should n't brush up on her music .. nd start a little class for the neighborhood . On the spur of the moment , he has persuaded her to teach French to their friends , run a weekly bridge clinic , and enter her peonies in the garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he expects her to be as comfortable behind the footlights as she is in an easy chair . When she got laryngitis on the eve of the annual choral-society concert , Mr. McViddy administered hot lemonades hourly through the night ? and never has opened a door for her since . MADAM CHAIRMAN . Mr. McViddy is the product of a long line of P.T.A . presidents and volunteer firemen , and he takes the family 's community responsibilities seriously . Mrs. McViddy could not very well refuse the nomination for alternate recording secretary of the Community Fund after her husband 's whirlwind campaign for her on the commuting : rain . With his coaching , she serves with such distinction that she was soon advanced to the vice presidency and is the choice to head three major organizations n 1951 , because Mr. McViddy has the vision to see beyond the family . Mrs. McViddy could be one of her husband 's wives to perfection , or three with incredible success . She does n't realize it , but she manages to perform  | as his complete harem amazingly well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the invention of the washing machine has relieved her of all her duties except the labor of delivering children , chronically belittles the job she is doing . Why should n't she say " We 're all out I of steak , " and gracefully serve bacon and eggs - when unexpected guests drop in. instead of feeling guilty about it ? Why ca n't she skip the dusting without apologies on the day she takes her six ! year-old 's class on a picnic ? Why ca n't she enjoy her afternoon 's gardening without worrying about whether her fingernails will look decent for the Millers that evening ? Why ca n't she say " We 're eating out of cans tonight " when she has spent the afternoon wresting a new playground from the city fathers , and let the family share her pride in this accomplishment ' Why ca n't she ask her husband to get breakfast one morning when she need ; to catch up on her sleep , without thinking she has failed as a wife ? Why ca n't she ship the children off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that she wants some time to herself ? IF SHE 'D only remember that twentyfour hours a day , three hundred and sixty-five days a year , she is impersonating Mr. McViddy 's nine wives , it would do wonders for her self-esteem . Then when her husband starts the evening with the conventional " And what did you do today , dear ? , " instead of replying with her usual " Oh , nothing . " she could set him back on his heels with : " Oh , I 've just been playing Mrs. Mom . Mrs. Super Service , Mrs. Open House . Mrs. Booster , Mrs. Budget , Mrs. Blue Ribbon , Mrs. Gourmet , Mrs. Eve , and Madam Chairman ? and what did yo .. do ? " And her husband , who loves her in spite of everything and does n't real : want a queen for a wife , might take th hint , wash the dinner dishes singlehanded , and begin to relax . Actually , the standards of perfection for which American women constantly strive are a tribute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sense of responsibility to their families and the community . No one would want to change that . It is only when the goal becomes perfection rather than the satisfaction of making a happy home and a better community that being nine wives becomes an unending series of grim responsibilities robbing the whole family of their pleasure in living .  |
