Whatever eventually happens to Basic English , Basic Chinese is a sensational success . Since 1930 it has enabled 46,000,000 Chinese , who otherwise might have stayed illiterate , to read &; write . The man who put Basic Chinese across , lithe and lively James ( " Jimmy " ) Yang Ch'u Yen lit momentarily last week in New York , Providence , Washington . Jimmy Yen moves fast : at 49 he has fomented an almost incredible cultural revolution , and hopes he has just begun . <P> Jimmy Yen is organizing postwar plans for China . To many a Chinese he is more important than generals or cabinet ministers . In any case , he speaks for the Ping-min Chiao-yu , the Mass Education Movement which he founded and directs , and which revolutionized Chinese education by using Basic Chinese . <P> While Basic English with its 850 words ( TIME , Sept. 20 ) is intended mainly for international communication , Basic Chinese ( TIME , Oct. 4 ) is primarily for Chinese . It consists of 1,000 characters ( words ) most commonly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters . It can be learned in 96 hours from four little books . Chinese coolies and peasants ( 85% of the population ) now need only bestir themselves a bit to become literate . Jimmy Yen sees to it that they stir increasingly . <P> Boulogne Beginnings . Jimmy 's ancestors were old-fashioned scholars . In the Mission School of Western Learning at Pao-ning , he studied science , geography , history , English and Christianity . After his Hong-Kong Edward VII Scholarship blew up because he was not a British subject , Jimmy was reduced to going to Yale ( ' 18 ) and Princeton ( M.A. ' 20 ) . After graduating from Yale he went to France for the Y.M.C.A. , worked in a Boulogne canteen for 5,000 coolies of a military labor battalion . These workers kept Jimmy busy writing their letters home , reading newspapers to them . <P> Back in China the philosopher Hu Shih ( later Ambassador to the U.S. ) had taken to writing in Pai-hua or spoken Chinese ( as contrasted with written Chinese , called Wen-li ) . But even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large were still illiterate . <P> Jimmy analyzed the letters he wrote for his coolies , found a vocabulary of about 1,000 Pai-hua characters sufficient to write all of them . Then he called a mass meeting . When he told the coolies they could do what coolies had never done , only 40 agreed to take a lesson . After four months they could write a letter , read news , and soon the canteen was a nightly humbuzz of coolies studying Basic Chinese aloud . Jimmy went to Paris to show other Chinese camp agents what he had learned about teaching coolies . <P> China now had a linguistic instrument which could help rebuild the nation . But the literate coolie veterans of the war had next to nothing to read . So Jimmy set out to create a plain people 's literature in Pai-hua . The peasants were generally skeptical , but eventually Jimmy 's revolution spread to thousands of centers . In addition to reading and writing , many of these centers teach public health , improved economic ways , civics . They are an integral part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adviser to Chiang Kaishek , many a night of whose sleep he ruined with exciting visions of a China reconstructed by mass education .
