Americans are prone to think of Europe resisting Communism like a hungry man resisting the temptation to steal : all he has to do is sit tight and remember what his parents taught him . <P> The truth is not so simple . There are many roads to power and Communists are willing to use them all . So resistance to the Reds takes many forms . Some of them are in the Communists ' own conspiratorial patterns . A reporter tracing anti-Communist forces in Milan this month could begin in the Great Hall of Sacred Heart University , on the day of Milan 's patron saint , and arrive by a fairly short line at a midnight session with machine guns of the Catholic underground . <P> " As a Priest . . . " Twelve thousand tough , enthusiastic young Milanese Catholics jammed into the Great Hall to honor St. Ambrose and hear militant words . Cried Monsignor Adelmo Bicchierai , spokesman of Cardinal Schuster , Archbishop of Milan : " The time has come to live again the days when the Lombards rose around Alberto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for victorious martyrdom . . . . " <P> The packed crowd cheered the Monsignor 's final words-the message of Cardinal Schuster himself , who sat a few feet away tightly clasping his cross : " It is the duty of every right-thinking man to support the Government in its difficult struggle . . . . Let the Milanese be worthy followers of their patron St. Ambrose . May St. Ambrose protect Milan ! " <P> But just how were these militants to assist the saint ? To a questioner after the celebration Monsignor Bicchierai gave a poker-faced reply : " As a priest I must tell you that the crucifix and the rosary are the arms of Catholics . " He paused and with a twinkle of black eyes and a deprecating spread of hands added : " What can I know of tear-gas bombs and machine guns ? " <P> " Whose Wife Will Say . . . " A fair answer would be : probably a great deal . During Milan 's disorders last month ( when partisans occupied the local prefecture for a menacing 24 hours ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hip pocket had kept guard in the streets near the Catholic daily newspaper Italia . They were members of north Italy 's Catholic underground militia , Avanguardisti Cattolici-Catholic Vanguardists . Milanese called it simply " A.C. " <P> So far only the silhouette of A.C. was visible , but it was a striking silhouette . Its leaders claimed that it was purely defensive , would never act save in self-defense or when called upon by the government . But Avanguardisti " eyes " were in every important factory , including the Communist-thronged industrial area of Sesto San Giovanni . Boasted an A.C. member : " No hostile truck leaves Sesto without the Catholics in Milan being alerted . " <P> A.C. 's recruiting standards were exacting : physical fitness , sure loyalty and freedom from potentially embarrassing family obligations . One militia leader explained : " We do n't want anyone who has children so small they ca n't be cared for by nuns and not big enough to take care of themselves . And we do n't want anyone whose wife will say at a crucial moment , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
