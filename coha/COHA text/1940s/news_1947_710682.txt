txt Economics Examination Criticized To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES Judging from the examination in economics given to the students of summer high schools this year , one would never imagine that there were historic debates over labor-management relations culminating in the TaftHartley Labor Control Law , or that there were grave problems over prices and inflation , or serious contentions over monopoly problems , or life-anddeath discussions over foreign trade , credit and currency : One would think that we were still living in the textbook age of 1904 , and that our student 's are absolutely lacking in opinions and attitudes on the controversial issues of the current scene . Not an item in the test needed an awareness of or an acquaintance with newspapers . One would not ever suspect that economics is controversial or contemporary . As far as the composition questions are concerned with regard to their arrangement , one would imagine all that we economics teachers are concerned with is that the students should be able to repeat the material in the definitional form of textbook manner . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank for Reconstruction and Development . The Marshall Economic Plan and the Taft . Hartley Labor Control Law are not in the high school texts yet . But is that any reason why we should n't teach them and test our pupils on them ? MARTIN WOLFSON . Brooklyn , Sept. 2 , 1947.
