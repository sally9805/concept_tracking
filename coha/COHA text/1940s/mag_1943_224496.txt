At 47 , grey - haired , jut-jawed Alvin George Brush sometimes feels like the old-woman-in-the-shoe . As board chairman of American Home Products Corp. , he runs one of the biggest and the fastest-growing drug , food and household goods companies in the U.S. Its 5,000 products range from auto paint to penicillin . <P> So far this year , A.H.P. has gobbled up seven companies , may still top its ' 41 record , when it picked up nine . But last week kinetic Mr. Brush had his mathematical mind firmly fixed on the postwar world : he had just completed a dicker with Metropolitan Life for a $7,500,000 loan to rebuild , reorient and expand further his scattered $8,400,000 plant at war 's end . <P> Chemicals and Beauty . Brooklyn-born , educated at New York University ( ' 21 ) , Alvin Brush started as an accountant with National Aniline , watched it merge into mighty Allied Chemical &; Dye . But Mr. Brush did not like the chemical business , quit to found his own accounting firm . He would probably be running it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sidled into his life . <P> In 1931 , Miss Forbes married Paul Richmond , president of the R. L. Watkins Co . ( Dr. Lyon 's Tooth Powder ) . Seven months later , Mr. Richmond died and left her his control of the company. * Mr. <P> Brush who had been handling the company 's accounting , was called in to manage it for her . <P> When Sterling Drug bought Watkins in 1934 , Mr. Brush moved to Affiliated Products ( Louis Philippe cosmetics ) . He did such a bang-up job that American Home , looking around for new blood , decided on him . The quickest way to get him was to buy his company . It did . <P> Buy and Profit . At the time , American Home was still making a fat $2,000,000 a year , but profits had been slipping ominously . New Board Chairman Brush skimmed over the company history , thought he saw the reason . When A.H.P. was formed in 1926 , it promptly started buying up smaller companies and boosted profits in the process . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then dropped . Mr. Brush 's solution : start buying again . <P> In the next eight years , American Home picked up 34 drug and food companies for $7,642,556 in hard cash , 307,528 shares of stock ( worth $18 million ) . It ended with a list of products that sounds like an inventory of a housewife 's cupboards : Clapp 's Baby Foods , Anacin , Black Flag insecticides , Old English Floor Wax , 3-inONE Oil ; BiSoDol , Kolynos Tooth paste , G. Washington Coffee . The com pany also spread into sulfa drugs , serums , vaccines and , recently , into large-scale production of penicillin . <P> Cradle to Grave . All this smart , fast buying did what it was supposed to do - zoomed profits . For the first nine months this year , sales hit an alltime high of $62,000,000 , with an estimated net profit after taxes of $3,200,000 ( $3.50pershare ) . <P> For the year , sales will probably top $80,000,000 . In the face of this , American Home has good reason not to merge into one tightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> But now American Home is about finished buying . It has all the drug com panies it can handle without competing with itself . With a few more food com panies , Alvin Brush can achieve his post war ambition to supply the U.S. citizen 's household wants from the cradle to the grave . <P>
