THE lights go down , the curtain goes up , and while the lights are still down a newsboy hollers : Opera , Opera , as if he were hollering : War or Murder or some such other message . A dozen and a half other voices say the word , at first in quick succession and then simultaneously , in a dozen and a half other ways . There is now three or four feet of lighted stage in front of a brightly lit back-drop . The back-drop is a painting of a street-corner , by a good American artist . It is very much like the back-drops of old vaudeville-picture theatres , and the moment is very much like the moment in the old vaudeville-picture theatres when the picture has ended and the stage show is about to begin . Consequently , a seedy-looking YOUNG MAN wearing a portable shelf full of small boxes comes out briskly and takes the center of the stage . He has the half-arrogant , half-embarrassed air of one who knows he is a nuisance but a necessary nuisance . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to speak . THE YOUNG MAN ( With expression ) Ladies and Gentlemen . ( Loudly ) Your kind indulgence for a moment , please . ( He waits . An elderly but alert and eloquent LADY is talking to another elderly but not alert or eloquent LADY in a box close to the stage ) Your kind indulgence for a moment , please . ( The eloquent old LADY continues to make confusion . He shouts ) Lady ! ( The LADY almost falls out of the box ) p. 3 LADY ( Briskly ) Yes ? THE YOUNG MAN Your kind indulgence for a moment , please . LADY ( A little irritated ) Kind indulgence ? We 've come here to hear the opera , not to buy popcorn . THE YOUNG MAN Lady , you 'll hear the opera , and I 'm selling candy , not popcorn . LADY ( Gaily ) Well , on with the opera . We have our candy . ( She indicates a large box of chocolates ) THE YOUNG MAN ( Trying to ignore the LADY ) Ladies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opera , young man . It 's Tristan , is n't it ? THE YOUNG MAN Lady , you 'll hear the opera when it 's time to hear the opera , and it 's not Tristan . Now , let me try to sell a couple of boxes of candy . ( To the audience ) Ladies and Gentlemen . Before the show starts , the management has asked me to call your attention to the object of this theatrical entertainment , which is simply to entertain you . Nothing more . The entertainment has absolutely no plot or message . There is considerable singing , considerable dancing , and a number of scenes from life . p. 4 LADY I thought you said you were going to sell candy . THE YOUNG MAN I am selling candy . The author of this entertainment has called it Opera , Opera because it is n't an opera . What he means by opera is an old lady arguing with a young man over nothing at all , vice versa , and heretofore . By opera he means also practically anything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Opera is yourself , for instance , talking on the telephone to somebody you do n't like , or somebody on the telephone who does n't like you talking to you . Opera is war in Europe and what it does to the dreams of children . It is solo and pandemonium , aria and irritation , ballet and bewilderment , delight and delirium , grace and bother , glory and many other things too numerous to mention . Being no less absurd than war and murder , opera is always out of style and , like war and murder , it is always going on . In this country , however , only occasionally is opera lifted from the streets to the stage of a theatre , and then only for snobs . Snobs are the inhabitants of the world  --  all of them  --  for a moment slightly better off than snobs , who may be , for all we know , in the snow . This opera is for all snobs , rich and poor , high-brow and low-brow , brilliant and dull . This opera is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other opera . It is an Italian opera , in English . Or an English opera , in Italian . Or , better still , an American opera with two intermissions . These intermissions are part of the opera . The author has very carefully written them into the entertainment , so that everybody in this theatre is in this opera , giving the entertainment a cast larger than the cast of The Birth of a Nation . The author requests that during the intermissions everybody talk about art , so that the form of the entertainment will be rounded out . Those who have nothing to say to anybody about art are requested to talk about religion . If there are any who have nothing to say about either art or religion , the author kindly asks them not to leave their seats . ( A player-piano begins to play How Ya Gon na Keep Them Down on the Farm ? YOUNG MEN who look a lot like the YOUNG MAN on the stage , each wearing a shelf loaded with boxes of candy , appear in the aisles all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in just a moment . As a special offer to this audience only , we are going to give away a thirty-five cent box of taffy kisses , free of charge , to all who care for taffy kisses . This is not a contest . All you have to do is give one of the boys in the aisles one dollar  --  let me repeat , one dollar  --  for this book of pictures , and with the book the boy will hand you , free of charge , the thirty-five cent box of taffy kisses . In the box , in addition to the taffy kisses , you will find , for the men , various kinds of small paper and tin toys , and , for the women , little cards with messages on them on how to be attractive and all that kind of stuff . ( A bell rings ) The show is about to begin . The boys will pass out the candy for only a few moments . ( The full orchestra joins the player-piano . The YOUNG MAN turns and runs off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dead halt . All the BOYS , who have very seriously gone about their business , disappear ) ( The stage is absolutely empty . Very dramatic music comes up swiftly , almost violently , and a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN wanders out onto the stage . The music stops abruptly . The YOUNG MAN reappears carrying a plain chair . He asks the GIRL with a gesture to stand on it . She does so . He strolls forward ) p. 5 THE YOUNG MAN Oh yes . I forgot to tell you that you will be able to understand all the words of this opera , although you may not understand what the words mean . ( He gestures gently , and sweet music and the YOUNG WOMAN 'S song begin simultaneously ) The words of the song : One two three fourfive six seven eight . THE YOUNG MAN Opera . THE YOUNG WOMAN ( Singing ) One two three fourfive six seven eight . ( The YOUNG MAN walks off , while the GIRL goes on singing a number of variations of these eight words . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He points out the GIRL to the BOY , and gestures for him to get busy . The BOY begins singing with the GIRL , the same words . He gets down on one knee before the GIRL , and lifts his arms up to her . The music fits itself to his behavior ) ( While this is going on , the YOUNG MAN comes forward again ) THE YOUNG MAN One two three four five six seven eight . That 's what they 're singing to each other . Nobody knows what these words mean . They 're just words or numbers . Seven used to be my lucky number , but now they 're all unlucky . Maybe the music means something , but if it does , it does n't mean the same thing for everybody . That 's opera for you . ( The YOUNG MAN steps back and watches the SINGERS . The SINGERS come to a dramatic lyrical climax . The BOY opens his arms to the GIRL . She steps down from the chair . They stand staring at each other . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gorilla-like BOY holding a revolver . With a movement of his head the GORILLA asks the YOUNG MAN if the party to be bumped off is the BOY singing , and the YOUNG MAN nods that he is . The GORILLA shoots the BOY . The music leaps upward with the shot and on his knees the YOUNG SINGER begins to sing tragically to the GIRL ) Oh one , oh one , one.One , one one one . ( The GORILLA is delighted , the GIRL frightened . The YOUNG MAN walks forward to the stage ) p. 6 THE YOUNG MAN Tragedy . You see , you shoot ' em to get a little sadness into it . To tell you the honest truth it does n't seem sad to me , but sooner or later somebody has to kill somebody . ( The YOUNG WOMAN takes the dying BOY in her arms and the two sing a magnificent duet together ) Oh one , etc . ( The BOY falls dead and the music stops abruptly . The GORILLA asks if he is to shoot the GIRL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is not to do so ) THE YOUNG MAN ( To the dead BOY ) O.K. You can go now . I 'll need you later . ( The BOY gets up and goes ) ( To the GIRL ) Act broken-hearted for a moment . GORILLA What do I do ? THE YOUNG MAN Sing to her . GORILLA I ca n't sing . THE YOUNG MAN O.K. We 'll have a recitative , with dramatic music . GORILLA What 's that ? THE YOUNG MAN You talk , and the orchestra plays music . GORILLA What do I say ? p. 7 THE YOUNG MAN Well , in opera she 'd be your sister , so you 'd probably say : Sister , I 'm sorry . Say something like that . ( The music comes up ) GORILLA Sister , I 'm sorry . Sister , I 'm sorry . ( To YOUNG MAN ) What else ? THE YOUNG MAN No . No . You 're doing fine . Just keep that up . It 's the music that counts , not you . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say anything else you like . GORILLA O.K. Sister . I 'm sorry . Sister , I 'm sorry . Sister , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . THE YOUNG MAN ( To the audience ) The idea here is to show you how contradictory the human heart is . You hate this gorilla at first , but when he says he 's sorry , you stop hating him . You do n't exactly like him , but you do n't hate him either . He 's pathetic . Sympathetic . GORILLA ( To YOUNG MAN ) Have n't I been sorry long enough ? THE YOUNG MAN Yeah . Now , threaten to shoot yourself . GORILLA Shoot myself ? THE YOUNG MAN Yeah , it 's opera . Remorse . Go ahead . Point the pistol at your heart . ( The GORILLA points the pistol at his heart ) p. 8 GIRL What do I do , beg him not to shoot himself ? THE YOUNG MAN No , not in this opera . GORILLA What do I do , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be a hero first . Tell her about it . Tell the people about it . GORILLA What do I say ? THE YOUNG MAN Tell ' em : I am a murderer . GORILLA O.K. ( Music ) I am a murderer . THE YOUNG MAN Do n't forget this is an opera . Put a little class into it . I am , I am , I am , I am a MURDERER . Like that . GORILLA O.K. I am , I am , I am , I am a MURDERER . Now what ? THE YOUNG MAN Now say : Sister , I have taken the life of your lover , and therefore , in order to balance things , I must take my own life : pity me . GORILLA What was that again ? THE YOUNG MAN ( Singing the lines himself ) My own little sister , my very own dear little sister , pity , oh pity me , I have taken the life of your lover , and therefore , in order to establish order in the universe again , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pity me. p. 9 GIRL I forgive you . THE YOUNG MAN No . The opera would end . If you forgive him , there 's no opera . Tell him : No . No . No . Brother , you are a murderer . GIRL No . No . No . Brother you are a murderer . GORILLA I feel like a louse . THE YOUNG MAN Never mind that . Now do the whole thing from the beginning while I run across the street for a quick drink . ( He runs off . The GORILLA and the GIRL do a fresh variation , very dramatic , of the whole scene , beginning with " Sister , I 'm sorry . " When they reach the end , the YOUNG MAN is still gone ) GORILLA What do I do now ? GIRL I guess you shoot yourself . GORILLA Well , I wo n't . Opera or no opera . GIRL You 've got to . GORILLA Why ? GIRL Otherwise it wo n't be an opera . I think everybody kills everybody else or himself before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( The YOUNG MAN returns ) p. 10 THE YOUNG MAN How was it ? GORILLA O.K. , I guess . She says I got to shoot myself now . Is that right ? THE YOUNG MAN Not exactly . ( He whistles . A YOUNG WOMAN appears , sobbing . To the GIRL ) She 's your late lover 's sister . She 's come to kill your brother.She 's carrying a knife . ( To the sobbing GIRL ) Tell them how you hate them or something like that . SISTER ( Music ) My brother is dead . Whoever has killed my brother , I shall kill . GORILLA What do I do ? THE YOUNG MAN Listen for a while . SISTER Oh , my brother . My brother is dead . Whoever has killed my brother , I shall kill . GORILLA I have killed your brother . THE YOUNG MAN O.K. You 've got the idea . Now all of you go ahead . SISTER The one who has killed my brother , I shall kill . GORILLA I have killed your brother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your sister . ( She does so ) ( The GIRL falls to the stage . The GORILLA runs to her ) p. 11 GORILLA My sister ! GIRL Death is what I want . My lover is dead and you killed him . Your mistress has killed me . Go to her . ( To YOUNG MAN ) Is that O.K. ? THE YOUNG MAN Swell . You can go now , too . ( GIRL goes ) GORILLA How about us two ? THE YOUNG MAN Embrace each other . ( They do so . YOUNG MAN whistles . All the CANDY-BOYS , carrying their shelves , come on stage ) Sell your candy . BOYS ( Clear , sincere voices )
