txt Used Paper Bags Feared I am fully aware of the conditions surrounding the paper problem . Apparently the shortage has seeped into the grocery business as well and the storekeepers are finding it a little more difficult and expensive to obtain brown paper bags . They have , therefore , been asking their customers to return the used paper bags . Is it not possible for disease to spread this way ? My little daughter , who is a student in one of our public schools , is ill now of scarlet fever . She is the only student in. her school who has this disease . Therefore it is logical to assume that she did not contract it by any association with her schoolmates . The food that comes into our house lately has been wrapped in second-hand bags . Now , I do n't assume to know very much about medical science and I do n't know whether or not the scarlet fever germ can be transmitted this way , but even if it ca n't there are other diseases that can be , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped before it can . do too much harm to our civilian popu ?
