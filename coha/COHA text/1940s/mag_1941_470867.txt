ASTBOUND Channel Convoy " is James M. Minifie 's account of a trip from Portsmouth to London last September on a destroyer accompanying a convoy of coasters . Mr. Minifie , who is in charge of the London bureau of the New York Herald Tribune , is now in this country on leave . He was born in Burton , England , in 1900 and when a small boy emigrated with his family to western Canada , where his father had taken up a homestead . He grew up on the prairie and before he was sixteen had maneuvered himself into the Canadian Army . When the first World War ended he was a cadet in the R.A.F. In March , 1919 , he was discharged and went back to school ? first at Regina College and then at the University of Saskatchewan . He was the Rhodes Scholar for Saskatchewan in 1923 . When his three years at Oriel College , Oxford , were up , he travelled in Europe until he was broke and then got a job in an English preparatory school to earn his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined the New York Herald Tribune . In 1930 Mr. Minifie went to Paris as Leland Stowe 's assistant and later went to Spain to cover the war on the Loyalist side . In October , 1936 , he was captured by Franco troops on the Aranjuez road . His driver and militiaman were shot and he was shipped to the French frontier by way of Talavera and Salamanca . In 1937 he was made Rome correspondent . " I survived three threatened expulsions , " he says , " and five last warnings and left under my own power in May , 1940 . " He was sent at once to London where he has been until his recent trip to the United States . " I won an argument with a German bomb on September 13th ? it was a Friday . My ankle was skinned ; the bomb was destroyed . " Mr. Minifie is married and has a six-year-old son . DOUBLE YOUR MONEY D orothy Baker , author of " Grasshop- pers ' Field Day , " was born in Montana , educated in California , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now on the faculty of Harvard College . Mrs. Baker is best known for an extraordinary novel , Young Man with a Horn , published two years ago . Though not a musician ? Mrs. Baker has taught French and Latin and worked on the editorial staff of a West Coast labor publication she was intensely interested in jazz and was familiar with all the great American bands . Inspired by the life and tragic death of the young Leon ( Bix ) Beiderhecke , one of the greatest of the trumpeters , she wrote her novel . Nothing like it had been done before or since and the book put Mrs. Baker in a peculiar literary place by herself . She now lives in Cambridge and , since the publication of Young Man with a Horn , has been writingshort stories .

Irwin Ross , author of " What They Really Think , and Why , " is twenty-one and was graduated from Harvard College last June . While in college he wrote for the revived Harvard Monthly and was one of the founders of The Progressive . As a delegate he had first-hand experience with the American Youth Congress . During his senior year he began doing free-lance work for various New York periodicals . Last October we published a piece by him called " The Tempest at Harvard , " the story of the long fight between President Conant and the Harvard faculty . Mr. Ross is now working for the International Student Service as Refugee Secretary . " Democracy 's Scapegoat : Youth " is by one of America 's best-known anthropologists , Dr. Margaret Mead . Dr. Mead , the daughter of a Professor at the University of Pennsylvania , received her M.A. in anthropology from Columbia in 1924 .

Much of her work in New Guinea from 1931 to 1933 was done together with her first husband , Dr. Reo F. Fortune , a British anthropologist . The two of them lived among the tribes , learned their languages and customs , and even adopted native children to make their observations more accurate . Dr. Mead 's The Changing Culture of an Indian Tribe was published in 1932 ; Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies in 1935 . She married her second husband , Gregory Bateson of St. John 's College , Cambridge , in 1936 . Since 1926 she has been an assistant curator of ethnology of the American Museum of Natural History . Her latest trip was to Bali and New Guinea ? she went there in 1936 and returned in 1939 . One of her most recent conclusions is that warfare is " an invention like any other of the inventions in terms of which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooking our food instead of eating it raw , trial by jury , or burial of the dead . " Her most recent book , From the South Seas , is a reprint of three earlier volumes . On the 26th of November Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt in addressing the Woman 's Centennial Congress in New York , said that in 1840 there were but seven occupations in which a woman could earn money ? domestic service , keeping boarders , teaching young children , needlework , weaving , typesetting and bookbinding . In 1940 she was able to discover " 100 important careers open to women " and in the fist of scientists Margaret Mead 's name led all the rest . GROSS ItOTALTY B lake Clark got the material for his piece about Nama-hana , " The Queen Who Weighed a Ton , " while teaching at the University of Hawaii .

After being educated at the St. Petersburg school of cadets , he accompanied Krusenstern on his voyage of 1803-06 . Promoted to Lieutenant , Kotzebue was placed in command of an expedition in the brig Rurick . In this vessel , with only twenty-seven men , he set out by way of Cape Horn to find a passage across the Arctic Ocean . On this trip , he discovered the Romanzov , Rurick , and Krusenstern islands . In 1823 , Kotzebue , by then a Captain , was sent in command of two ships to carry reinforcements and provisions to the Russian colony in Kamchatka . Aboard was a competent staff of scientists who collected valuable information and material on geography , ethnography , and natural history . Kotzebue was in Hawaii on all three voyages . He tells about his second and third visits in two books . It is the book about his expedition to Kamchatka , A New Voyage to the Pacific , which tells about Nama-hana and which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Clark is Assistant Professor of English at Hawaii and came upon Nama-hana while reading accounts of early voyagers to the islands . This article will appear as a chapter in a hook called Honolulu on which he is at work . In addition to his books , Mr. Clark has conducted a historical column in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin . He says about Hawaii : " There is much that I could say about the refreshing tolerance of the various races towards one another , the friendly spirit of the Hawaiians , the industry and loyalty of the Japanese , the good humor of the Chinese , and so on . In Hawaii one works in such an ideal climate , too , that a mere description of it sounds like a boast . As someone has said , ' Hawaii has the climate California claims to have . ' There are two sides to the question of climate , however . Hawaii is a place where it requires real strength of character to get one 's work done . Not because the climate is enervating , because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or drive around the island , or go fishing are so great that only those who would be ascetics elsewhere get the normal amount of work done without great effort . My favorite diversion is riding a surfboard , though after all these years I have not been able to break my board in well enough to keep it from throwing me a few times each week . " Hawaii is as beautiful as the Tourist Bureau says it is . Flowering trees , the variety of color in the ocean blues and mountain green , the richness of the soil in which ferns grow higher than a man 's head , the rainbows which often appear two at a time one above the other , shock many people into an awareness of nature who have never had h before .

" RUBBER DOLLARS G lories Morrow Wilson 's " Buy Hemisphere Products ! " follows easily after Lewis Hanke 's " Plain Speaking About Latin America " which we published in the November number . After the froth of Good Will and Good Neighbor oratory has been blown off , the problem remains to figure out what American business men and the American government are going to do about Latin-American trade . Facts are facts and trade is life blood . Mr. Wilson attempts to show how there is a very real opportunity to increase that trade and that Latin America grows other things beside Argentine surpluses of grain and meat . Mr. Wilson was born in Fayetteville , Arkansas , in 1905 . Sixteen years ago he began to study farm life in the United States and since then has published ten books about it , four of them novels . At the same time he was attending the University of Kansas , working as correspondent for the Arkansas Gazette , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell , as a special reporter for the St. Louis Posh-Dispatch , and as a freelance foreign correspondent . For the past two years he has been reporting agricultural conditions in Central and South America . His books include Acres of Sky , Meriwether Lewis of Lewis and Clark , Backwoods America , Rabble Rouser , Roots of America , Aroostook , Country Living , America at Work , Ginger Blue , and Corn Bread and Creekwater . This last is described as " the landscape of rural poverty in the United States . " His eleventh book , about to be published , is called Middle America . From 1914 to 1919 he lived in Saskatchewan in a little town on the Frenchman River and on a farm fifty miles from the nearest village . After that his parents spent a year in Great Falls , Montana , and then moved on to Salt Lake City where Stegner went to high school and college . In 1930 he went to the Univershy of Iowa for graduate work and then taught for a year ( 1932-33 ) at the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Rock Island , Illinois , and taught there , but got into a row with the Fundamentalists and went to the University of Utah to teach in 1934 . In 1937 he received the Little-Brown prize for a novelette , Remembering Laughter , and quit teaching , intending to give all his time to writing . He did n't , though . Right now he is teaching again at Wisconsin . He is married and has a twoyear-old son . His novels include Remembering Laughter , As on a Darkling Plain , and The Potter 's House . This last , published in a special edition , appeared in November . Another novel is now in progress . Mr. Stegner 's short stories have appeared in many magazines both here and abroad . He has also collaborated in the writing of a textbook which is to appear sometime in January .

In the early days of the depression such a hunt was organized for a housing article . Upon casual consideration it does not seem as though the task of finding a good manuscript on housing would be inordinately difficult . It is a fact , however , that two years went by and manuscripts were read by the score before we got one . We have had somewhat the same sort of an experience in our search for a factual article on the refugees from Europe who have been coming to America during the last half dozen years . Isabel Lundberg 's " Who Are These Refugees ? " disposes of an editorial problem . Mrs. Lundberg. was born in New York and went to school at the University of Wisconsin and Vassar : For some years she edited a group of pulp magazines , then ? this was after the departure of the Messrs . Mencken and Nathan ? she became assistant editor of Smart Set . When Hearst killed this magazine , Mrs. Lundberg became assistant advertising manager for Carl Fischer , the music publisher , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment with radio programs . She is Executive Secretary of the Committee for Cultural Freedom . Her husband , Ferdinand Lundberg , has written many articles for Harper ' s . SHORT SUMMER UVULAR American interest in Mexico be-r gan twenty years ago ; this interest was formally acknowledged by the extraordinary exhibition of Mexican art since ancient times which was presented at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City last summer . In these twenty years thousands of Americans have traveled in Mexico , scores have written books about the country . Anita Brenner , one of the best known of the authors , got a running start by being born in Mexico ? at Aguas Calientes ? in 1905 . She is an anthropologist and was educated at the University of Texas , the National University of Mexico , and Columbia University . She did field work in anthropology for the Mexican National Museum and in 1926-27 was appointed to collect and study documents and examples of Mexican art for the National University of Mexico . In 1928 the New York Nation established a Latin-American Department and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which lasted a year , was one of the pioneer efforts to get a comprehensive coverage of important Latin-American news before the American public . In 1930 Miss Brenner was made a Fellow of the Guggenheim Foundation . Her books included Idols Behind Altars , The Influence of Technique on the Decorative Style in the Domestic Pottery of Culhuacan , and Your Mexican Holiday . For the last named , a combined travel and guide book , Carlos Merida made the illustrations . A revised edition is due to appear in a few weeks . Miss Brenner is married to a New York physician and lives in Yonkers. cc. -6 LOOK WELL . OH WOLVES ! TT IS N'T difficult to imagine how excited I Dr. Arnold Gesell must have been when he first heard about the wolf-children of Midnapore . Dr. Gesell is a psychologist and is Director of the Clinic of Child Development at the Yale School of Medicine , and rare PERSONAL AND OTHERWISE specimens like Amala and Kamala do n't come very often into a child psychologist 's life .

In so doing I hope I have also written something which will help others , particularly lay readers , for there is a profound unfathomed resistance to the acceptance of feral man . And I should be pleased if my step-by-step interpretation will serve to break down prejudices of antipathy and undue skepticism . The student scientifically interested will , of course , wish to consult the original source material reported in the Diary . " The Diary to which he refers is the one kept by the Reverend J. A. L. Singh of the Midnapnre Orphanage . Dr. Gesell was able to see this day-to-day account of the wolf-children through the courtesy of Professor Robert M. Zingg of the University of Denver who is preparing the Diary for publication . The photograph of Kamala is one of those taken by the Reverend Mr. Singh . Dr. Gesell was born in 1880 , graduated from the University of Wisconsin , and in 1906 received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught psychology in Los Angeles until 1911 and then went to Yale to become Professor of Education . There he established the Child Development Clinic ? at first called the Yale Psycho-Clinic -- at the Medical School . At this juncture he decided to study medicine and received his M.D. from Yale in 1915 and simultaneously was appointed Professor of Child Hygiene . When the Clinic was founded Dr. Gesell 's chief interest was the study of backward children . By 1919 his attention had shifted to the normal child whose complex infant behavior he considers of importance to clinical medicine . He has developed methods for the early diagnosis of defects and deviations in the mental growth of infants and pre-school children . As his chief instrument of research he chose the cinecamera and in 1930 established the Photographic Library of the Yale Films of Child Development and began editing scientific talking films , published by Erpi Classroom Films , Inc . Best known of his writings are the volumes entitled The Mental Growth of the Preschool Child and An Atlas of Infant Behavior . The Atlas is a two-volume work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms and development of infant behavior patterns . A recent ten-year study made in collaboration with the clinical staff reported the mental growth careers of eighty-four infants and children in a volume entitled Biographies of Child Development . His most recent book is called The First Five Tears of Life , a Guide to the Study of the Preschool Child . " The Biography of a Wolf-Child " is a miniature of a book on the same subject which Dr. Gesell expects to bring out short1 ? . MUS MIJSCULLIS u stav Eckstein ' .

Another chapter was added to the story last October when the American liner Excalibur , homeward bound from Europe , stopped at Bermuda . The British censor boarded the ship and seized a huge consignment shipped by Martin Fabliani , the Paris art expert . The consignment included 270 works by Renoir , 30 paintings by Cezanne , 12 by Gauguin , 7 by Degas and a number of others by Monet and Picasso . All these pictures , once in Paris museums , were seized because , according to the British authorities , their export was " an obvious German ruse to secure dollar exchange . " In this way , works of art finally joined the contraband list . In " Embattled Collectors , " Elizabeth and Douglas Rigby rehearse some of the adventures of art in a world at war .

Later she worked for a New York publisher and then got a publicity job . She has written for various magazines . Right now the Rigbys are finishing a book on collectors and collecting which is to include a survey of the psychological and historical background of this familiar activity .
