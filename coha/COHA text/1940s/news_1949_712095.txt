txt Whittaker Chambers supported Government charges of perjury against Alger Hiss yesterday when he testified in Federal Court that he had received State Department documents on munitions from Mr. Hiss between February , 1937 , and April , 1938 . Mr. Hiss is charged in a twocount indictment with having perjured himself before a Federal grand jury last year . One count rests on his statement that he never transmitted State Depart , ment documents to Mr. Chambers , a Communist party courier at the Itime of the alleged incident . The second count is based on his statement that he never saw the $30,000-a-year former senior editor of Time magazine after Jan. 1 , 1937 . By his testimony on the third day of the trial yesterday Mr. Chambers contradicted both the Hiss statements . Mr. Chambers , the sole witness yesterday , devoted most of his testimony to espionage and Communist party activities . He identified Mr. Hiss , former assistant to the Assistant Secretary of State , as a member of the Communist party . He pinned the same label on Mr. Hiss ' wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defendant . Says'HIsses Refused to Quit testified that at Christmas , 1938 , he had pleaded with the Hisses to join him in breaking away from the Communist party . He told Judge Samuel H. Kaufman and the jury of ten men and two *omen that both Mr. and Mrs. Hiss refused to break away from the Communist party . Lloyd Paul Stryker , defense attorney , objected repeatedly to the line of testimony on the ground that it was not material to the perjury charge . Thomas F. Murphy , Assistant United States Attorney , insisted that the testimony was germane to the issue . Though Judge Kaufman sustained many of Mr. Stryker 's objections , the Government prosecutor succeeded in recording a detailed account of the relation between Mr. Chambers and the Hisses . The defense has taken the position that any espionage activity conducted a decade ago is immune from prosecution through a three-year statute of limitations . Concentrating on an effort to destroy Mr. Chambers ' credibility , Mr. Stryker began his cross-examination of the Government 's star witness just half an hour before court adjourned for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if they did not believe Mr. Chambers , the Government had no case against Mr. Hiss . Questions Chambers on Oath " Mr. Chambers , do you know what an oath is " was the defense counsel 's first question . " An oath is a declaration which a man makes when he promises to tell the truth , " the former Communist replied . " And he also calls upon Almighty God to witness the truth , of what he says , " Mr. Stryker added , with agreement from the witness . " In October , 1937 , you were an active Communist doing what you could to overthrow this Government by force or violence , or any other means , Mr. Stryker said . " That is correct , " the witness replied in the quiet tone characteristic of his testimony . " And on Oct. 18 , 1937 , you got a Government job with the National Research Project , and you took the oath of office prescribed by United States statutes , and you swore to it , " Mr. Stryker contin. ued . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ? that was the name you were using then ? ' solemnly swear to defend the Consti- , tution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domes. : tic . " I took that oath , " Mr. Chambers conceded . " You took it though you knew it was false through and through , " the defense attorney charged . " You took it to deceive the United States into giving you a job . In taking it you perjured yourself . You took a false and perjurious oath . " " Of course , " Mr. Chambers smiled . The attorney then pointed out that the witness , in his job application , had made other false statements . These included false entries on college education , omitting to mention a job with the New York Public Library , and omission of employment on The Daily Worker and the leftist magazine New Masses . Mr. Stryker was unsuccessful in gaining an admission that the witness had been " kicked out " of Columbia College for writing " Play for Puppets , " a " highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get acceptance of his charge that Mr. Chambers had been dismissed from the library job for stealing books . Mr. Chambers said he was accused there of having stolen books , but that in fact the books came from the Columbia University Library . " Anyhow ; as a Government employe you took Uncle Sam 's pay checks , cashed them , and used the proceeds knowing that you had obtained them through fraud and deceit ? " Mr. Stryker suggested . " That 's right , " Mr. Chambers re , plied . " You had no shame and no con ' science about it , is that what you mean to indicate ? " the attorney pursued . " I mean to indicate that I was a Communist , and that my conscience did n't bother me , " Mr. Chambers replied . " Then a question of right or wrong , as we ordinary Americans would see it , did not bother you ? " " That 's right , " said Mr. Chambers , whose cross-examination was then adjourned until 11:30 o'clock this morning . Details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murphy , the rotund 48-year-old former Communist courier detailed numerous incidents in testifying to his friendship with Mr. and Mrs. Hiss . Many of these went beyond the crucial date of Jan. 1 , 1937 , which Mr. Hiss had told the grand jury marked the end of the association . Mr. Chambers , target of a pending $75,000 slander suit brought by Mr. Hiss in Baltimore , repeated the allegations on which the suit is based . This time , however , he elaborated in more detail the testimony he had given last year before the House Committee on Un-/ American Activities and the New York Federal Grand Jury . Testifying that he first met Mr. Hiss early in the summer of 1934 , he was asked to identify the former State Department official in court . " That 's him , sitting over there beside his wife Priscilla , " the witness said , pointing diagonally across twenty-five feet of space . " I was introduced to him in a Washington restaurant by Harold Ware and Jay Peters . The meeting was for the purpose of intro , ducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness identify Mr. Ware and Mr. Peters was balked when Judge Kaufman upheld Mr. Stryker 's obI jection . " I was to head an underground apparatus in Washington , different from the previous apparatus , " Mr. Chambers continued . " My recollection is that Mr. Hiss was then a lawyer in the triple-A  --  the AgriI cultural Adjustment Administration . I next saw him two or three ' weeks later in his Twenty-eighth Street apartment with Mrs. Hiss . We had a general conversation . I introduced myself to these strange people and the meeting was more or less getting to know them . Thereafter I continued to see Mr. Hiss fortnightly , always at his home , and never where he was em-ployed , " From that beginning , the friendship continued until April of 1938 , Mr. Chambers testified . Meantime , he said , he had moved his family from Baltimore into the Hiss apartment in May , 1935 , and lived there rent-free for six weeks , until the lease expired . The Hiss family moved to a house at 2905 P Street , N. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he testified that Mr. Hiss had become counsel to the Senate Munitions Investigating Committee , familiarly known as the Nye Committee . Says He Photographed Papers The witness testified to a conversation early in 1935 with Mr. Hiss in his P Street house , and said : " I am quite clear on the substance of that conversation . It dealt with the securing of documents from the State Department by means of Mr. Hiss ' position in the Nye Committee . We received certain State Department documents which were asked for in the name of the Nye Committee , ' and Which were turned over to me . They bore on munitions , the munitions trade , but I ca n't remember more specifically . I photographed them and turned the developed films over to Jay Peters . " As his testimony progressed Mr. Chambers had rough going , with frequent objections from Mr. Stryker and admonishments from , the bench to confine his answers to the questions . Several times Judge Kaufman pleaded fee specific testimony on conversations , while the defense counsel waxed bitter about Mr. Chambers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testified that in " January or February , 1937 , " he had introduced Mr. Hiss . to Col. Boris Bykov . While defense objections blocked his identification of Colonel Bykov , he has been described in other investigations as head of the Soviet espionage machinery in this country . " I met Mr. Hiss in a cafeteria on Chambers Street , " the witness recounted , " and we took an ' El ' train over the Brooklyn Bridge and got off at Ninth Avenue . We en , tered the Prospect movie theatre there and took seats on a bench in the mezzanine . Colonel Bykov soon came out of the audience and introduced him to Mr. Hiss . Colonel Bykov spoke German , Mr. Hiss spoke English , and I translated . " When I introduced them I said : ' Peter ' ( that was Colonel Bykov 's pseudonym ) ' this is the lawyer ' ( which was Bykov 's synonym for Hiss ) . There ' was nothing more than a formal introduction in the movie . " Then we walked along Prospect Park West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subway or cab to the Port Arthur Restaurant in Chinatown in Manhattan . " " On the walk , was there any disussion ? " Judge Kaufman inquired . " No , " the witness responded blandly , " Colonel Bykov knew who Hiss was . " " Strike it out ! " ruled the court . " Prior to the meeting , " Mr. Chambers resumed , " I had told Mr. Hiss in Washington at the end of 1936 who Colonel Bykov was . I told Alger Hiss that Colonel Bykov was head of the underground apparatus with which I was then connected , and with which Hiss was connected . I said I found Bykov an unimpressive man , but told Hiss that he was important in the underground and asked him to discount his unimpressive qualities . " At the Port Arthur meeting Bykov told Hiss that the Soviet Union was greatly threatened by rising fascism and that documents taken from the State . Department by Alger Hiss might help it greatly . Colonel Bykov asked.if Mr. Hiss would be willing to procure such documents . Hiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the witness quoted Colonel Bykov as saying that he was chiefly interested in documents affecting the Far East , Germany , Italy and Japan . He said the Soviet officer had also inquired about the poSsi , bility that Alger Hiss ' brother Donald might be able to help as well . " Alger Hiss said he was not sure that his brother was sufficiently developed as yet to secure documents , " Mr. Chambers testified . " Colonel Bykov suggested that perhaps Alger Hiss could persuade his brother . I think he meant ' persuade ' ? he used the German word ' uberregen . ' I saw Alger Hiss next in his Thirtieth Street house and the transmission of documents began soon thereafter . " After finding the fortnightly arrangement too slow Mr. Chambers said Mr. Hiss arranged to bring home the documents every night , Mr. Chambers photographed the originals and returned them , he said , later delivering the copies to Colonel Bykov In New York at prearranged meeting places that were changed constantly . The arrangeMent continued , Mr. Chambers added , until he broke with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence that his friendship with the Hisses continued beyond Jan. 1 , 1937 , Mr. Chambers testified that Alger Hiss had lent him $400 to buy a car in Maryland in the fall of 1937 . In October , 1937 , he said his acquisition of a Government job was known to Mr. Hiss , though the latter had nothing to do with his getting it . In August , 1937 , he said , he saw a summer stock performance of " She Stoops to Conquer " in New Hampshire with the Hisses , after all three had driven up from Washington . He identified cellophane-wrapped documents , forty-seven in number , as those given to him manually by ' Mr. Hiss . Mr. Chambers also identified two strips of microfilm as those that contained pictures of original documents given to him by Mr. Hiss . At Christmas time , 1938 , he said he saw Mr. Hiss and his wife for the last time in their home at 3415 Volta Place , N. W. , Washington . Recounting that , Mr. Hiss had given him a Christmas present for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hisses to break with the Communist party . They said they would not . Alger Hiss said it was a pity that I had broken with the party because he had been informed that a new and impbrtant post had been offered which I might fill . He said they now knew who I was . They had known me as ' Carl , ' my apparatus name . He asked me what kind of Christmas I would have . When I said ' Rather bleak , ' he gave me a Christmas present for my daughter . " After breaking from the Communist party , Mr. Chambers said , he saved copies of some documents and film and put them into safekeeping with relatives until last year , when he retrieved them for the Hiss slander suit . He said he had been baptized as a Christian in 1940 , his first baptism , and that he was now a member of the Religious Society of Friends , which he joined in 1942 . At the New Year , 1937 , he said Mr. Hiss had received through him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a present from the Soviet people in gratitude for the work of American Communists . " Judge Kaufman in adjourning court said today 's session would begin at 11:30 and would end at 1 o'clock . The curtailed session was made necessary by prior obligations of counsel , the judge added .
