txt Conferees on the excess profits tax bill probably will accept the Senate 's theory that these levies should be restricted to earnings above the average for the 1936-39 base period . This appeared to be the general opinion of observers , both in and out of Congress Yesterday , as the Senate passed the tax bill after defeating , by a vote of 44 to 30 , the Brown amendment which would have made interest from all future issues of federal . state and local bonds subject to full income taxation by both the federal and state governments . The bill will be sent to conference today for adjustment of differences between the House and Senate versions . These differences are so great and so many that those who have watched the progress of the bill through the House and Senate are reluctant to forecast the ultimate form of the legislation . Indications are , however , that the excess profits taxes will apply only to earnings above the base period average and will not reach into the normal incomes of corporations . Connally Proposal Approved Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a rider , the Connally bill which would impose high income taxes on both individuals and corporations in event this country should become involved in war . This same war profits bill was attached to the first tax bill this year . but was abondoned in conference . It appears to be headed for a similar fate this time . The Senate approved it without a record vote after finance committee Chairman Harrison . in charge of the bill , smilingly said he would accept it and " take it to conference " . Leaders on both sides of the Capitol expressed the hope that the conferees could reach an agreement on conflicting provisions of the bills in time for the legislation to receive final approval by the latter part of next week . Once the excess profits tax bill has been approved and sent to the White House , . the leaders plan to rush other business on the legislative slate and make an attempt to adjourn the session . Followed Committee 's Recommendations The Senate , following the recommendations of its committee on finance , made two basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the excess profits taxes , broadly speaktr.z. te c.armr:gr , ir : of the f.t  --  t ? ? ? re.r , ? ? fer ? - te 1936-39 years on the assumption that any increase is attributable either directly or indirectly to government defense spending . It provides for additional revenue by increasing the normal corporate income tax by 3.1% , which lifts it to 24% . Numerous other amendments , scattered throughout the bill , stem in large measure from these two alterations . The Senate accepted , with but very little discussion several highly important amendments . One . offered by Senator Pittman ( Dem Nev. ) . would allow corporations to use any three of the four base period years in determining their average earnings . Another by Mr. Pittman exempts from the excess profits taxes earnings from the mining of certain " strategic " war materials . George Suggests Choice of Payment Senator George ( Dec .. Ga. ) placed in the bill an amendment giving corporations the choice of paying the excess profits tax rates on either flat amounts of excess profits or on excess profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This amendment retains the tax rates provided in the bill and is designed to lengthen the effect of the excess profits taxes on large companies with large earnings . The amended rate schedule follows : " 25% of so much of the adjusted excess profits net income as does not exceed the greater of $20,000 , or 20% of the excess profits cerdit : " 30% of so much of the adjusted excess profits net income as exceeds the greater of $20,000 or 20% of the excess profits credit and does not exceed the greater of $50,000 or 40% of such credit ; " 35% of so much of the adjusted excess profits net income as exceeds the greater of $50,000 or 40% of the excess profits credit and does not exceed the greater of $100,000 or 60% of such credit . " 40% of so much of the adjusted excess profits net income as exceed. , the greater of 5100.000 or 60% of the excess profits credit and does not exceed the greater of 5250,000 or 80% of such credit ; " 45% of so =Oh of the adjusted excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80% of the excess profits credit and does not exceed the greater of $500.000 or 100% of such credit ; and - SO% of so much of the adjusted excess profits net income as exceeds the greater of $500,000 or 100% of the excess profits credit . The revised schedule works out this way : Corporation A. has an excess profits credit of $20,000,000 and has 62,000.000 of excess profit . Under the original schedule , this company would pay the graduated rates on the first $500,000 of excess profits or $204,000. and the maximum rate of 50% on the remaining 61.500,000 or $750,000 making a total of $954,000 excess profits tax . Under the George amendment , this company would pay the minimum rate of 25% on all of its excess profits since the $2,000,000 does not exceed 20% of the excess profits credit of $20. - 000,000 . Its excess profits tax would be $500,000 under the George amendment None of these amendments had the support of the finance committee which had considered them during executive session on the tax bill . Members indicated they would probably be discarded or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference will be the earning limitation differences . As approved by the House , the excess profits taxes leaned definitely in the direction of earnings limitation , since they would have applied to the normal income of many corporations , especially those which made good earnings records during the 1936-39 base period . The House bill allowed corporations to compute their excess profits and excess profits taxes under either the invested capital or average earnings methods , but imposed severe penalty taxes upon those companies electing the latter method . These penalties amounted to a 4.1% additional tax on the normal income and a 5% increase in the excess profits tax schedule . The Senate bill limits the excess profits taxes to earnings in excess of the average for the four base period years . and exempts entirely all corporations which , during the taxable year . +'rev ' gcf .. nn currently invested capital . Also , all corporation. , are allowed a fiat excess profits exemption of $10.000 , as compared with a $5,000 exemption in the House bill . It is out of these differences in the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the standpoint of the Treasury Department . the House bill is preferable to the Senate bill , although the department has no particular liking for either measure . The Treasury would have preferred an excess profits tax plan which would have treated as excess profits all earnings in excess of a fixed rate of return on invested capital . regardless of the past earnings history of a company . This would have hit directly at the high earning companies , and would have had the effect of a partial limitation on the rate of corporate return . This theory of excess profits taxation was rejected by the House as well as by the Senate . At this time , it is impossible to predict what action will be taken in conference . The two measures differ so widely that the field for compromise is practically without limit . Members of the House ways and means committee who will serve as conferees have indicated a strong dislike for the increase in the normal tax provided by the Senate . This increase brings the rate on corporations with taxable incomes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the basis for trading in conference . So far , three possible compromises on this point have been advanced by individual members of the finance and ways and means committees . These are : 1 . Limit the normal tax increase to those corporations which have enough excess profits to cover this addition ? to their tax bills ; 2 . Reduce the increase from 3.1% to around 134% or 2% ; and , 3 . Eliminate the increase altogether and delay an upward revision of normal income taxes until next January , when there would be an opportunity for a more or less general overhauling of the federal tax structure . Finance committee members who will serve as conferees have indicated strongly they will appose a restoration of the penalty taxes provided in the House bill . The purpose of the penalties , they contend , was to provide additional revenue by taxing normal income under the guise of taxing excess profits . If raising of additional revenue is to be coupled with excess profiter  --  taxation . they contend , it should be done directly through an increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Differences Will Clear Quickly After the conferees have reached a decision on what shall constitute excess profits  --  either earnings above the average for a number of prior years or in excess of a fixed rate of return on invested capital  --  and on ! Whether the bill should contain special revenue features , the chief stumbling blocks will be removed and other conflicts between the two bill . can adjusted without great delay . The conferees are not expected to have trouble in getting : together on the national defense features of the bill . These are the special five year amortization plan for defense plant expansions and suspension of the Vinson-Trammell Act profit restrictions on Navy and Army ship and aircraft contracts .
