txt CITES COLLEGE RECORD Reader Recalls 19 Strike-outs by a Harvard Pitcher To Sports Editor of The New York Times : Last Sunday 's sports section of your paper included a baseball story crediting Ted Harrison of Yale with a new college record of fourteen strike-outs . I believe it was in 1895 , Harvard vs . Yale , that Jack Highlands ( not to be confused with his younger brother , Al , who pitched for Harvard the following season ) , yes , Jack Highlands , a big fellow filled with energy ; enthusiasm and ability , stood on his head every time he struck out a Yale man . And Jack Highlands struck out nineteen Yale men . In the same game Carter of Yale struck out eleven Harvard ' men . So the average of these pitchers was fifteen apiece , which in itself exceeds Harrison 's record . Incidentally , the New York Giants tried to hire both pitchers after that season , but neither would play professional ball . CONVERSE CLEVELAND , Asbury Park , N. J. , July 1 , 1940 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Times : I read with interest John Kieran 's article commenting upon the game that marked the turning point in Bob Grove 's career . Vividly do I recall the game in question , which was the first of a double-header , July 4 , 1925 . In fifteen innings of exciting baseball Grove , for the first time , displayed the skill that was to rank him later as a great pitcher rather than . a mere " thrower . " Although he allowed fifteen hits , it was a scoreless duel until the Yanks pushed over a marker in the fifteenth . Pennock , allowing only three hits , really deserved the victory , but one could n't help feeling sorry for Grove , who thrilled every one by pitching skillfully apd courageously in threatening situations time and again . It was a really remarkable exhibition of pitching with men on base . Something you do n't forget . Perhaps the Philadelphia fans received some consolation when their favorites won the second game , 8 to 3 , behind Slim Harris . JOSEPH F. X. CUNNEEN . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Round Robin To Sports Editor of The New York Times : If no one of the three major league baseball teams in the metropolitan district gets into the world series this year , . what would you think of the feasibility of staging a round-robin series this Fall among the Yankees , Giants and Dodgers ? the Red Cross to receive a percentage of the gate receipts ? WILLIAM H. ADAMS . New York , July 3 , 1940 . Editorial Note : That 's a kind thought in one way and , considering the current situation in the league races , a very cruel thought in another way . Motion tabled . Regarding Baseball Helmets To Sports Editor of The New York Times : Your note to my second letter regarding baseball helmets is not in accordance with conditions under which players in the big leagues play . It is immaterial whether the player is a star or not . When he signs his contract he signs away all right of independent action . If I am the owner or manager of a big league team and pay $100,000 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or he sits on the bench or is traded or sold . I have seen two men killed and many severely injured by pitched balls . As I wrote previously , back in the early Eighties many players wore no gloves except the catcher , and his gloves were slightly padded and had the fingers cut off . In the Eighties , when I came north from New Orleans , I thought it was " sissie " to wear a fielder 's glove , but I soon got over that . When Bresnahan put on shin guards , was he called a " sissie " ? No . Shin guards were soon adopted by all catchers in the league . C. WICKLIFFE THROCKMORTON . New York , June 30 , 1940 . Editorial Note : President Ford C. Frick of the National League is conducting inquiries and experiments regarding the use of helmets by the batter . This argument might be suspended until Mr. Frick 's report is handed down . BROOKLYN FAN 'S IDEA Suggests Team Play Six Men to Giants ' Eight To Sports Editor of The New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of June 21 , particularly to the next to the last paragraph concerning Mr. Brannick and the Dodgers , which states in part , " You take Coscarart and Lavagetto and Camilli out of that bunch and see where they finish . " The rebuttal to that paragraph is to take Denning off the Giants and see where they finish . As Al Smith would say , let 's take a look at the records of the number of games played by the Giants and won by them so far this season . Check the number of runs batted in by Mr. Danning , delete them from the score and see if the team would have won a particular game . Mr. Brannick wants to take three men off our Dodgers , leaving us with six men to play the field . We 'll take one man off the Giants and play them six to eight and still beat them . EDMUND MURPHY . New York , July 1 , 1940 . Editorial Note : Mr. Brannick should be the one to answer this , but , unfortunately , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sports Editor of The /Veto York Times : Whether you are a Dodger rooter or not , and I 'm not , at least we have to credit our friendly enemies across the bridge with having played an inordinate number of extra-inning games . Some one suggested that if all the extra-inning frays were taken into consideration , the Dodgers would have actually played several extra games . Too bad these ca n't be counted in the regular schedule , for I 'm sure , if they were , the Brooklyn warriors would appreciate - being nearer the end of the season with their present standing . T. J. FLYNN . New York , July 4 , 1940 . One for the Scorer To Sports Editor of The New York Times : In these mechanized days , I am firmly convinced that means should be devised at the Stadium and Polo Grounds to announce to the fans what the scorer decides is a hit or an error . Not only would this be enlightening to the average spectator but it would also serve the purpose of educating many youngsters who are becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion between my youngster and myself started all this . At least , one family argument would have been settled , had an official announcement been made . F. T. SMITH . New York , July 4 , 1940 . PROPOSES NEW COURSE Writer Believes Maryland Lake Suitable for Crew Races To Sports Editor of The New York Times : In view of the troubles during the recent Poughkeepsie Regatta , I wonder if any one has thought of the big lake formed by the Conowingo ( Md. ) dam . This would be ideal for the races . A mile wide , it could readily accommodate twenty crews . There is no current or tide . A branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad runs along one shore and there are no trees to obstruct the view . There would be no yachts to obstruct the view of the spectators . It is convenient to New York , Philadelphia , Baltimore and Washington and there would be none of the delays such as has been the case on the Hudson . T. R. JAMISON . Philadelphia , July 2. 1940 . Editorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Poughkeepsie Test To Sports Editor of The New York Tines : Having been a spectator at the last Poughkeepsie Regatta , I had only one regret  --  that the oarsmen had to wait many hours before being permitted to row . If the officials made an error in sending off the crews in rough water , they erred more seriously in not scheduling the entire program for morning , when conditions were favorable , instead of late afternoon . Why not continue the races by giving full consideration to the young men who row in the crews , R. C. BLACK . Forest Hills , N. Y. , July 2 , 1940 . Changing Soccer Teams To Sports Editor of The New York Times : As one of the leading sports , soccer is in the stage of transition as far as team names go . Present names are misnomers as line-ups will show . Formerly staffed by immigrants , the various Swedish , Czech or German teams now have rosters of native talent . They call themselves Swedish or Prague teams , but they are mostly American , Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 , 1910 . A. A. U. Official Seeks Help To Sports Editor of The New York Times : I am trying to get an answer to a question , which has been put to me very often , and therefore am asking you for this answer . In foot racing , automobile racing or horse racing the race is run in a counter-clockwise direction , and I want to know why it is run in this direction and not the other way . The solution to this will be greatly appreciated . CHARLES A. ELBERT . Secretary - Treasurer , Metropolitan A. A. U. New York , July 3 , 1940 . Editorial Note : If it is n't merely a development by tradition or an agreement for the sake of uniformity , it must be something that Dr. Einstein will have to explain . Baer Won in Eighth To Sports Editor of The New York Times : It is my belief that Max Baer won in the seventh round , as Tony Galento did not get up for the eighth . What is your opinion ? Louis WILLIAMS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The ruling of New Jersey boxing officials was that the knockout was in the eighth round , the seventh round having been completed and the bell having rung to start the eighth .
