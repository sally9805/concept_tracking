txt Madeline Webb testified yesterday before Judge Jonah J. Goldstein and the jury in General Sessions that she had nothing to do with the murder on March 4 of Mrs. Susie Flora Reich , middleaged refugee , in the Hotel Sutton in East Fifty-sixth Street . She appeared determined and there was no lack of poise in her manner when she took the stand . Miss Webb is on trial with Eli Shonbrun , 32 years old , her lover , and John D. Cullen , 38 , both of whom are admitted petty thieves , on a first-degree murder indictment , alleging they and Shonbrun 's middle-aged uncle , Murray Hirschl , had plotted to rob Mrs. Reich of $2,000 in jewels in the Sutton , where the refugee was suffocated by adhesive tape wound around her face . Shonbrun , the day before , had testified that nekher Miss Webb nor Cullen had had anything to do with the slaying , which took place in a suite Shonbrun and Miss Webb had engaged two weeks before . He said he had bound and robbed the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was aided by his uncle , Hirsch , who had plotted the robbery with him . Shonbrun also had accused Hirsch ' of having made the telephone call a few days before to the Reich suite in the Hotel Woodrow , in West Sixty-fourth Street , in the name of Miss Webb . Assistant District Attorney Jacob Grumet insists that this call was the lure that brought Mrs. Reich to her death in the Sutton suite . A wo --  , man relative of Mrs. Reich charged Miss Webb made the call . Hirschl , who is awaiting trial on the murder indictment , testifying as a prosecution witness at the start of the trial , swore that Shonbrun and Cullen plotted the robbery of Mrs. Reich in the presence of himself and Miss Webb in the hotel . He and Miss Webb , he added , were around the corner when Mrs. Reich was suffocated . Miss Webb told him , he swore , that she had left the Sutton suite by one door as Mrs. Reich entered by another and that she heard Mrs. Reich scream when Shonbrun and Cullen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispose of the jewelry obtained in the robbery , and that he and Miss Webb joined Shonbrim and Cullen in a taxicab after Shonbrun and Cullen were alleged to have left the dying woman in the Sutton suite . They made an unsuccessful attempt to dispose of the $1,500 diamond ring Shonbrun and Cullen told Miss Webb and him they had snipped from her finger , he said . Denies Knowledge of Plot But Miss Webb , from the start of her testimony under James M. Springer , a former judge of her native city , Stillwater , Okla. , insisted vehemently she knew nothing of the plot to rob Mrs. Reich , a friend she had met at the Woodrow about a year before , or her consequent death until Shonbrun , Cullen and she hired a furnished room in the Bronx , three nights after the killing . Hirsch ' had testified that he had brought word to them of the death of Mrs. Reich in the balcony of the Victoria Theatre , in West 125th Street , on the afternoon of the day after the killing , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had bought in the midtown district . He was trying to dispose of the diamond , he swore , which , the day before , a Canal Street jeweler had separated when Hirschl sold the platinum mounting to him Miss Webb said she first learned of the murder when she bought a paper in the Bronx as they were on their way to the room , in which the following Tuesday she and Shonbrun were trapped and the Reich diamond found in an empty pillow case on a bed . " I was stunnned , I was flabbergasted , " continued Miss Webb , who added she demanded immediately from Shonbrun , " what is all this about ? " pointing to the newspaper headlines of the murder . " He told me he knew nothing about it , " Miss Webb declared . Through most of her testimony under direct and cross-examination by the lawyers she assumed a bored attitude . She was almost always in conflict with Judge Goldstein and the prosecutor . She persisted in replying in a tone inaudible even to the bench , sometimes , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer at length certain questions of " interest to me . " When she felt she had an opportunity to give an answer favorable to herself and her co-defendants , she invariably raised her voice but repeatedly Judge Goldstein had to stand up and admonish her " speak louder , " and have the stenographer read the question and answer to the jurors . At times she ignored Judge Goldstein 's admonition to answer pie question and not go into " immaterial remarks . " Frequently , when under direct examination of Mr. Springer , she indicated impatience when he insisted that she confine her answers solely to his questions . At other times , when under cross-examination of the prosecutor , she became sullen and refused to answer , removing her large , orange-tinted glasses and giving vent to a deep sigh , before complying with the judge 's insistence that she answer . Clash Between Lawyers There was a clash between her lawyer and Mr. Grumet when Mr. Springer asked the witness : " When Shonbrun told you he knew nothing about the Reich murder , did you believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She said that on the following day , Sunday , she left the Bronx furnished room and telephoned Darrell Woodward , a radio singer , from a near-by drug store to ask his advice on what she should do , since Eli had insisted that he knew nothing of the killing of Mrs. Reich in the Sutton suite , although she felt something would happen to her for having lived in it up to the murder . - She identified Mr. Woodward in court , and later when she was temporarily excused under direct examination Mr. Woodward took the witness chair and said she had called him for advice , and added he had known her father and Miss Webb in Stillwater , which also was his home . Miss Webb finally testified that Eli admitted on Sunday that " something had happened " to Mrs. Reich and advised her to go to District Attorney Frank S. Hogan 's office . She added that Shonbrun told her he had arranged with the chief defense lawyer , Jacques Buitenkant , whom Shonbrun had testified the day before he had known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had to Clear My Name " " I had to clear my name , " Miss Webb went on in explanation . " I never was involved in the law before . Eli was with me when I called Mr. Woodward . " Seldom in her entire testimony did she set a definite date , time ' or location for any incident in the murder . Usually she answered " I could not recall " or " I paid no attention to that at the time . " Sometimes she continued talking in a high voice when the judge and the lawyers clashed over inadmissible testimony . Mr. Grumet demanded to know at the start of his cross-examination whether she had done any work since she came to this city in 1939 from Hollywood , where she was reported to have made an unsuccessful attempt to get into the movies . She was vague in her answers , finally mentioning a brief job as a " photographic model " and a seemingly even briefer job as a showgirl . Then she became an advertising model , she said , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she had done for a living in the last year , she replied defiantly , " I 've been a wife . " " Of Eli ? " demanded the prosecutor . " Yes , " she shot back . She never noticed the names under which Shonbrun registered at the various hotels . in which they stopped , she said . " Did n't he tell you ? " broke in Judge Goldstein . " There was no necessity for it , " she replied tartly , half turning around in the witness chair to face the Court . She said that , although she could not recall the names of the hotels Shonbrun and she lived at in the last six months , the Woodrow , in West Sixty-fourth Street , " stands out in my mind because that is where I first met Mrs. Reich . " She added that , after she had moved from the Woodrow , she invited Mr. and Mrs. Reich to visit her , " but neither of them came . " She denied she ever told Mrs. Reich her father was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground on which Trinity Church stands . Denies Seeing Mrs. Reich 's Gems She never saw any jewels on Mrs. Reich , she went on , adding she was " a simple , humble woman . " " Did you tell Shonbrun about her jewelry ? " asked the prosecutor . " No , " she answered , " the only time I spoke to him about her I merely mentioned a little fairy story about her . " She insisted she did not tell 3honbrun Mrs. Reich " was very wealthy . " Miss Webb became excited when Assistant District Attorney Grumet virtually accused her of e. havin used the telephone in an attempi ' to lure a Mrs. Sachs to the Hotel Sutton suite before the invitation was given to Mrs. Reich . " I certainly did not , " she cried , half standing . " Did n't you call up Mrs. Sachs and tell her you recently had been married , that your married name was Leopold , and ask her to come to the Sutton to meet your hus-band ? " " No , no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under cross-examination a little over an hour , when the trial was adjourned by Judge Goldstein until today , when she will resume the witness stand .
