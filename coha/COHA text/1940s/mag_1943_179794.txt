As wartime stay-at-homes took to their chessboards last week , Samuel Reshevsky , onetime child prodigy , for the fourth successive time won the biennial U.S. chess championship . <P> If thin-haired , bespectacled , 31-year-old Reshevsky lived in present-day Russia-where chess is the national pastime and people jam the streets to watch the moves of championship matches on giant dummy boards-he would be a national hero . But in the U.S. , where chess has no more spectator appeal than calisthenics , Reshevsky is just another guy named Sam . <P> When Sam came to the U.S. from his native Poland at the age of nine , he lived up to his triumphant European press clippings by playing 20 U.S. Army officers simultaneously ( a contest that gives each opponent 20 times as much time to contemplate each move ) without losing a game . <P> Child prodigies often grow up distorted .

At the 1935 International Masters Tournament at Margate , England , little Sam copped first prize-outwitting among others , onetime World 's Champion Jos Capablanca . <P> Today Reshevsky is one of the world 's recognized Grand Masters. * He has crossed the Atlantic four times to compete , and in no tournament has he ever failed to win a prize ( first , second or third ) . But Reshevsky has never yet bid for the world 's championship-a title acquired only by challenging and defeating the champion . Reason : to challenge , one must put up $10,000 , of which 66 ? % goes to the defending champion-win , lose or draw . At War 's end , Reshevsky hopes to raise the necessary funds . <P> Meanwhile , Sam Reshevsky has a job as accountant for a Manhattan engineering &; construction firm , coaches its chess team on the side . For recreation he plays rapid-transit chess , a variation in which competitors are allowed only ten seconds per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexandrovitch Alekhine of France , The Netherlands ' Max Euwe , Russia 's Mikhail Botwinnik , Estonia 's Paul Keres , Czecho-Slovakia 's Salo Flohr , Manhattan 's Reuben Fine .
