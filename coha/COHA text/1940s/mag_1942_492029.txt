I FIRST heard his name in early October , 1941 , in Manila . I was dining with several officers of the Philippine Department in their quarters built on top of the ancient Spanish walls of Fort Santiago , which housed the headquarters of General MacArthur 's Usage . A sudden tropical downpour drummed loudly on the flimsy tin roof of the mess hall . Outside , the curtains of the deluge blotted out the lights of Dewey Boulevard and the twin red stars high on the steel radio towers at nearby Cavite . It was a melancholy , stifling night , but in the bright dry room one talked , as every visitor in Manila did in those days , lightly enough of the possibility of a Japanese invasion . " If it conies , where will they strike first ? " I asked . Col. Charles Willoughby drew a deft map of Luzon on the major 's tablecloth . " The main attacks will probably come here , at Lingayen Gulf , " he said , making an arrow , " and then here  --  at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're not giving away military secrets ? " The officers all laughed . Colonel Willoughby pocketed his pencil . " No , " he said . " Just quoting military gospel , according to Homer Lea . " " Homer Lea ? " " Tell you a funny story , " the colonel said . " When I first came out here , about a year ago , some nimble-wit in Military Intelligence had just hauled in a ' spy . ' Young college-bred Filipino . Seems he had written a letter to a pal , complete with rough maps , analyzing the Jap plans for invading Luzon . The pal turned it over to G-2 , who had the boy on the mat . His maps and plans corresponded rather too well with the department 's . The terrified kid swore he 'd got the whole thing right out of an old book he 'd taken out of the library . ' Son , have you by any chance been reading Homer Lea ? ' I asked . When he produced a library card which showed he had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonel said , " over thirty years ago a strange young man who called himself General Homer Lea wrote a book about a war to come between America and Japan . In it he described , in minutest detail , the Jap campaigns against the Philippines , Hawaii , Alaska and California . " " A sort of American Nostradamus ? " The colonel said , " Not at all . Homer Lea was neither a mystic nor a prophet . He was a scientist . He studied the science of war  --  the fundamental laws of which are as immutable as those of any other science  --  a fact which is always forgotten in peacetimes by civilians . He also sought to analyze the causes of war and diagnose the symptoms of an approaching conflict . And having proved , at least to his own satisfaction , that great causes of war existed between the United States and Japan , that the symptoms of the approaching conflict were apparent to all but fools or wishful thinkers , he proceeded to set forth the tactical course that war would take . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Point . Damned convincing militarily  --  if you accepted his political premise  --  that our democracy would n't get ready in time to lick the Jape . " " Is America ready ? " the colonel asked of nobody in particular . " From which dismal question , " I said , " am I to assume that you , like Homer Lea , doubt for a moment we could lick the Japs , even if they attacked tomorrow ? " The colonel said , " Do n't jump to conclusions . First , Lea wrote more than thirty years ago . Since then there have been revolutionary changes , not in the science but in the instruments of warfare . Second , like all scientists , he did not make enough allowance for that forever inexact science , the science of the human soul . There are two things  --  but only two things  --  having to do with the defense of these islands which Lea did not , could not , foresee . One was the courage and genius of a man called Douglas MacArthur . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are decisive factors , then Lea 's analysis that these islands can not be held will be proved wrong . " " Are they decisive factors ? " " Well , I hope to God they are ! " the major said fervently . " Amen , " said Colonel Willoughby . " But in any case , next month when you get home brush up on the general . " The Valor of Ignorance I THOUGHT no more of Homer Lea . Not until 1 the first newspaper maps appeared with their sinister little arrows which showed where the Jape were landing  --  at Lingayen . Then suddenly I remembered Colonel Willoughby 's tablecloth map and his " military gospel according to Homer Lea . " My bookshop had never heard of Author Homer Lea . In the end , I carried not one but two books away from the New York Public Library . The first was called The Valor of Ignorance . On its warped , faded blue covers were the arms of our republic , emblazoned in gold . It had not been popular reading . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times since it was published by Harpers in 1909 . Quickly I flipped through it until I came to the text surrounding the invasion map of Luzon  --  the same text , the same map , no doubt , the colonel 's Filipino " spy " had copied . Here was Lea speaking : " In a military sense , the Philippines are closer to Japan than were the shores of Manchuria in the Russian War . There are no Port Arthurs , with guarded fleets to threaten the transportation of her troops ; no armies of a quarter of a million men to oppose their landing ; no rigorous winters ; no tempestuous waters , such as swirl and break over the Yellow Sea ; no stormgirded shores Over whose ? billows and in the teeth of ice-laden gales landings must he made by lighters ; no Lio Yangs nor Mukdens with five hundred thousand men to drive back ; no wide plains to cross in parched heat or blizzards ; no half-frozen rivers to swim ; no mountainsides to clamber up , honeycombed with hidden mines ; no abysses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be overcome on these undefended islands . " The conquest of these islands by Japan will be less of a military undertaking than was the seizure of Cuba by the United States ; for while Santiago de Cuba did not fall until nearly three months after the declaration of war , the city of Manila will be forced to surrender in less than three weeks . It was occupied by the Japs in less than four . Otherwise the occupation of Cuba portrays with reasonable exactitude the manner in which the Philippines will be taken over by Japan . No naval force , unless equal in combative ability to the entire Japanese navy , and based on the Philippines at the beginning of hostilities , could have any appreciable effect on the invasion of these islands . Admiral Thomas Hart 's Asiatic Squadron , based on Cavite , consisted of a handful of cruisers , submarines and over-age destroyers , which retired to the N.E.I. thirty days after the invasion . " Harbor defenses in the Philippines , unless they form the base of a fleet strong enough to prevent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn defended by mobile armies of sufficient strength to prevent their investment , will prove in the end of no more defensive value than Morro Castle in the defense of Cuba . Port Arthur has again demonstrated the vulnerability of permanent fortifications and the old fallacy of their making . These stone castles of nations are but the dream castles of their vanity . The fortification of Manila or Subic Bay , or any other port , will not prevent nor retard the seizure of the islands by Japan , if other elements necessary to their defense are wanting . As the conquest of Cuba was accompanied by landing forces distant from any fortified port , so will the Philippines fall . Lingayen Gulf on the north coast and Polillo Bight on the east coast will form the Guant  --  namo Bays of the Japanese . " The conquest of the Philippines is no complex military problem , but is , on the other hand , so simple and direct that a few words will make it apparent . The American forces defending these islands do not exceed fourteen thousand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on Manila . On December seventh , they were fifty-five thousand white and native troops , all based on Manila . Japan , by landing simultaneously one column of twenty thousand men at Dagupan and another column of the same size at Polillo Bight , would ; strategically , render the American position untenable . These points of debarkation are almost equidistant from Manila , and are connected with it by military roads , while a railroad also connects Dagupan with the capital . " The impossibility of defending Manila with the force now stationed on the islands is seen in the strategic advantages inherent in Japan 's convergent attack . These two columns , more than double the strength of the American force , converge on Manila at right angles . Advancing at equal speed , they remain at all times equidistant from the American position . Should the American force advance to meet either column , the unattacked column , being as close to Manila as the American force , could throw itself in between . The Americans , separated from their base by an army equal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also as large , would be in a position wherein their capitulation could alone prevent their complete destruction . " If the American forces , on the other hand , should remain behind their lines at Manila , they would , in two weeks after the declaration of war , be surrounded by overwhelming numbers . It was for this very reason MacArthur declared Manila an open city , and retired to the Bataan Peninsula . The lines about Manila , as was demonstrated during the SpanishAmerican War , are incapable of prolonged defense . An aggressive enemy in control of the surrounding country can render them untenable in a short period of time . With the occupation of the Philippines by Japan . . . not again could an American fleet , regardless of its size , enter the Asiatic seas during the continuation of this conflict . " If the American forces should be increased prior to the war , and no other military efforts made toward a general defense of the Philippines , it would only result in increasing proportionately the size of the enemy 's advancing columns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor the inevitable end long retarded . " For defense of the Philippines belongs , not alone to an army or navy or fortified harbors , but to an intelligent combination of them all . This defense can not be relegated to those expedients that are consequent upon sudden war , but must be inherent in the national policy of the ( Continued on Page 69 ) republic and the military preparations of prior years . It can not be left to the shifts of unforeseen combat , but must be predetermined by existent conditions and such works as the knowledge and labor of man may evolve out of the science of war . " This world has been whittled down to a small ball . . . . No longer , as in Monroe 's time , does a vast Atlantic Ocean separate this continent from Europe . Man 's ingenuity has reduced it to a small stream . . . . The only isolation of which this nation can afford to boast is that rendered by fleets of battleships and mobile armies . . . " This republic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not differentiate between them and actual power . Japan , with infinitely less resources , is militarily forty times more powerful .... Germany ... can mobilize in one month more troops scientifically trained by educated officers than this republic will then be able to gather together in three years . . a modern war will seldom endure longer than this . . . . " A nation which is rich , vain and at the same time unprepared provokes wars and hastens its own ruin . . . A nation can become so rich that its very wealth will bankrupt it in a war with a country poor but frugal and warlike . . . . The contemplation of the inability of wealth to defend itself is not without bitterness , hence it is that man and whole nations shrink from the knowledge of this impotency . . . all the riches of the world can not supply national unity nor that perseverance which is unappalled by disaster . " Strangely oblivious to the militant character of the Japanese , to the vast military and naval power in their hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their predetermined struggle with this republic for sovereignty over the Pacific , a portion of the American people go on indifferently . . and with the utmost unconcern make no preparations for it . " How unreasonable it is to suppose that . . . Japan , possessed of two thirds of the population of this nation . . shall continue to exist on her rocky isles , but 1/250th of the earth 's lands , while an undefended one half lies under the guns of her battle-ships ! " The Pacific Ocean consists of more than 34 per cent of the world 's surface , and not only do more than one half of the human race rest somewhere about upon its littoral but two thirds of the undeveloped resources of the earth are in the lands upon whose shores its waters break . " It is this vast combination of mankind and unsquandered riches that determines the true significance of the Pacific . Whether the world in future is to be dominated by one nation or a coalition of them . . . in the Pacific shall it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careless on the one hand , predetermined on the other , that point of contact , which is war . ? " We exaggerate , not Japan 's capacity to make war , but our capacity to defend ourselves . . . . " When Japan declares war , one of two naval conditions will be existent : either the American Navy will be divided between the Pacific and the Atlantic , or the whole of it will be in the latter . Either condition will insureinstant Japanese naval supremacy . A division of the American Navy means the destruction of those portions in the Pacific ; while the fleets in the Atlantic will have no effect upon this conflict . . . . " The question that now rises naturally in the thoughts of the reader is , What will the U. S. be doing during ' the first three months ? Instantly the mind is crowded , not alone with the speculations of victory but with the vague grandeur of a nation 's hope . The Old Lamp is rubbed and vast armies are suddenly mobilized ; armaments are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the twinkling of an eye ; then winged . . . take their flight . . west . But what will actually take place in the republic after war is declared is well known . . . confusion , ignorance , peculation and a complete lack of every form of military preparation , armaments , supplies or means of securing them . . . " No state is ever destroyed except through those avertible conditions that mankind dreads to contemplate . Yet nations prefer to perish rather than to master the single lesson taught by the washing away of those that have gone before them . In their indifference , and in the valor of ignorance , they depart , together with their monuments and their constitutions . . . . " The Day of the Saxon , the second military book by Homer Lea , is equally prophetic , and equally gloomy . Published in 1912 , its thesis is also stark and simple : The inevitable coming of war between the British Empire  --  the Kingdom of the Saxon  --  and Germany . Lea predicted that if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power  --  if it could not , in short , quickly form a lasting military alliance with a great friendly land-army power  --  it was doomed by the " ever-resurgent " armies of Germany . But nowhere on the teeming greedy earth , except in the Western Hemisphere , where America alone among all the great powers neither feared Great Britain nor desired what was hers , could Lea , in 1912 , find for the Empire a " great land-army " ally . Saxon Sunset And despairing that the United States would ever see ? in time ? " that the British navy , not the Monroe Doctrine , is this republic 's true protection , " he foretold that " the Day of the Saxon " was drawing to a close , and that on a hundred fields of battle  --  in Belgium , France , Holland , Russia and Egypt ? the day of the Teuton was dawning . And final prophecy of all : Great Britain at long last , exhausted by her perhaps " victorious " Germanic wars , would then lose her Empire to Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades ago , as though they were already accomplished facts , the multiple Armageddons that now face ourselves and the British ? What were his spiritual , his intellectual and military credentials ? The frontispiece of the book shows a boy with a hard wide mouth , intense wide eyes , a wide brow , with long lank hair . The boy is wearing the goldepauleted uniform of a three-star general , and his breast is covered with medals . A greatcoat drops noncha- . lantly from one shoulder , and an extraordinarily long and delicate hand plays with the brass buttons of his tunic in a Napoleonic manner . But this is not an American uniform . It is a foreign uniform of some sort . This is strange because there is nothing foreign about that strong young American face or the name boldly written in a boyish scrawl beneath it . Let us see if the two prefaces in The Valor of Ignorance cast any light on the background of this young general . The first is by Lieut . Gen. Adna R. Chaffee , a former United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's idea of a rave notice . " We do not know of any work in military literature . . . more deserving the attention of men who study the history of the United States and the science of war . " But not a word about who Lea was or how he got to be a three-star general . The second introduction , by Maj. Gen. J. P. Story , is equally ecstatic . Story believes that Lea is the greatest unrecognized military genius America ever produced . " But neither does he tell us anything about Lea himself . I returned to the library . No , there was no biography of Homer Lea ever written . No , he was not in the Encyclopaedia Britannica . I sought Who 's Who for 1912 , the year his last book was published . He was there : " Lea , Homer , author ; b . Denver , Nov. 17 , 1876 . . . . Undertook relief of Kwang Hsu , Emperor of China , 1900 , 1901 . " And with this as a clue , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the strangest , most adventurous and significant stories that America ever knew ? and had ever forgotten  --  the story of a little cripple who longed to be a military giant , of a boy who gave his frail young life for China , and how that gift helped to change the course of the Chinese Empire in such a way that today China is in a position to help change the course of America and the British Empire . It is the story of the valor of Homer Lea . Playing Soldier In the early days of the Civil War , Alfred Lea , fourteen-year-old son of a Tennessee doctor living in Missouri , had made his way alone through Bleeding Kansas in a mule-drawn covered wagon to the Rockies . A few days after Alfred left , Doctor Lea , a rebel sympathizer , was murdered by border raiders . In Colorado , Alfred Lea mined at Cripple Creek , prospered mildly , married HersaCoberly , who bore him Homer and two daughters . He then engaged in abstracting titles , and in1892 moved with his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years . A teacher recalls that he was a " brilliant though erratic student . " The school records show there was nothing " erratic " about his marks . In Latin , Greek , French , history and mathematics he averaged for two terms well over ninety . Maybe it was a strange ambition of little Homer 's which made him seem erratic in adult eyes . He wanted to be a soldier . And it was so very plain he could never be . He was a hunchback child , and after he was twelve years old and five feet tall , he never grew . A curvature of the spine grew more and more pronounced , until it earned him the unhappy nickname of " Little Scrunch-Neck " among his classmates . But " Little Scrunch-Neck , " nothing daunted , even in school , resolutely played soldier . Trumpets of Destiny Two childhood friends , the late Harry Carr , of the Los Angeles Times , and Marco Newmark , recalled that after hours " he drilled the kids with broomsticks and laid out campaigns in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend that on Fourth of Julys Homer was n't content just to set off firecrackers , like other brothers . He insisted on staging maneuvers on the lawn , using the firecrackers as artillery to blast his little sisters out of the " untenable positions " he had entrenched them in . Why his sisters and schoolmates meekly took orders from the frail hunchback , whose manner was always gentle and whose voice was always soft , they could never quite explain . Years later , a Chinese who had been with him on the field of battle said , " He had eyes that could bury you nine feet under the ground , if you disobeyed him . " In 1894 , Lea entered Occidental College , continuing to specialize in classical languages and history , but his extracurricular interest in military matters continued unabated . Now , to the increasing annoyance of his classmates , who had outgrown their adolescent interest in playing soldier , Homer spouted the campaigns of Caesar , Hannibal , Alexander , Turenne and Napoleon , which he knew far better than they knew their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tendency to talk Chinese . Newmark says he picked it up from the family cook , a pigtailed Chinaman , who had captured the boy 's imagination with violent tales about his faroff land . Carr said that Homer once confided to him that his interest in China was the result of a strange series of dreams , in which at last , in a blare of Chinese trumpets , he saw himself revealed as the reincarnation of a historic Chinese warrior called the Martial Monk , marching at the head of his army to defend China . The true dreams of a small sick body , or the daydreams of a sensitive boy who felt his physical inferiority keenly , or simply the imaginative reflection of the interest all politicalminded Californians had in the Chinese problem in those days , the fact remains that by the time Lea entered Leland Stanford in 1895 to study law , his main preoccupations were all things military and all things Chinese . Although he was still popular , as cripples are always popular , most of his college classmates thought him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow student , wrote of him , " He was a quiet little chap . . . and talked rather large . . . bombastic , you might say , but there was an earnestness about him that impressed one just the same . " A gifted speaker , with a rich low voice , Lea orated of what he had come to call " the forthcoming sack of America by the expanding and predatory powers . " He had astonishing notions about vast " hemispheric wars between the nations . " Other fellows hung pictures of girls or baseball stars on their walls . Homer Lea hung huge maps , and on these maps he waged , with colored pins , a great world war between the Japanese and the Germans on one side , and China and the United States on the other . Or sometimes the war was between Russia and Great Britain , with India as the prize . " Witness , " he would say , " how India , the keystone of the Empire , is being remorselessly pried loose by the screw jack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States was ahead , Lea was in fine spirits and acted , according to a classmate , very exhilarated ; like he might be Napoleon . " But most days he was depressed , because , he said , " things being the way they are with the people , the politicians , the pacifists , the dericalists , the feminists and the isolationists , the Republic as he always called it and the Empire had to be behind . " Neighborhood Orient The one thing on which Irwin and all his fellow froshes agreed was that Homer played the " coolest , cagiest poker game " on the campus . Naturally , the little cripple could not go in for sports . But he did take up fencing , and until the severe headaches from which he had suffered as a child , and an eye ailment , aggravated by this exercise , caused him to abandon it , he held his own against all but the best campus swordsmen . His monstrously long arms gave him an advantage of reach over even much taller men . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several Chinese students . After a time he began to disappear nights into San Francisco 's Chinatown . It was there that he first came into touch with the members of the Po-Wong-Wui , a secret society of educated young Chinese dedicated to working for the reform of the Manchu Throne . Now , when he returned late at night and , according to some , a little drunk on Chinese wine , on the maps on the walls of his room , Lea waged a civil war against the armies of the tyrannical " Old Buddha , " the Manchu dowager empress , Tzu-Hai , who sat , like a fierce spider , weaving murderous plots , on China 's Dragon Throne . On two of Stanford 's faculty he made a definite impression . Ray Lyman Wilbur  --  now its president " very much admired his mind . " " He was very intelligent , " said Wilbur . " He was one of those men who always question professors . Healways wanted to know Why ? Why ? Why ? " On the other hand , Dr. David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admire Lea 's mind at all . From 1890 to the outbreak of World War I , Doctor Jordan was one of America 's most vociferous pacifists , and a profound believer in the power of international arbitration to avert war . At some point in the course of that first university year , the tiny cripple , who violently disbelieved in both , and the big eminent doctor probably crossed verbal swords . No doubt , Lea , who knew his history thoroughly , pointed out to the kindly doctor that " from the fifteenth century B.C. until the present time , a cycle of 3400 years , there have been fewer than 234 years of peace on earth . . . Disputes or disagreements between nations , instead of being the source or cause of war , are nothing more or less than the first manifestations of approaching combat . . . . To remove them by arbitration is at best but procrastination . " And he may have added his favorite admonition , " All great nations are born of the sword , and all nations , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sword . " The Call of the East Doctor Jordan found this young man " vulgar , loud-mouthed , excessively warlike . " Years later ? in fact , just two years before the outbreak of the first World War  --  in a letter published in a World Peace Foundation Pamphlet titled The Impudence of Charlatanism , Jordan called Lea an " ambitious romancer , " " a crippled dwarf " and the book itself " mischievous , " " worthless " and " nonsense . " Lea 's quarrel with the pacifist doctor was interrupted by the SpanishAmerican War . It was a bitter moment for warrior-student Lea , when , according to Wallace Irwin , " many Stanford boys left for the front , but the little hunchback could not go . " Nevertheless , Lea joined a college cavalry troop that included " a thousand freaks  --  the lame , the halt and the blind . " To a greater extent than even Irwin knew , Lea was all three . At the end of his sophomore year , a return of his old eye ailment sent him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he recovered , with no scars on his strange intense young face , the war was over . Lea could bear college no longer . To Harry Carr he said , " All great careers are carved out by the sword . Mine , too , I shall carve that way . " And when Carr gently reminded him of his deformity , Lea cited the example of clubfooted Byron in Greece . " And China shall be my Greece , " he told Carr . When Newmark said , " You 'll get your head cut off in China , " the little hunchback responded , " Fortunately , they 'll have a hard time finding my neck . " His sisters pleaded with him not to think of undertaking such a trip in his frail health . With that sense of predestination that comes to Destiny 's children , Lea replied , " A man never dies until his work is done . " In years to come , this was always his stock answer to pleas that he must " save his ever-failing strength . " When his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had already secured financial backing ; he had prevailed upon the China Reform Association to raise funds to send him as " secret military agent . " Carr thinks that the young Chinese patriots took Lea to their bosom because there is a Chinese superstition that hunchbacks are lucky . Irwin thought that it was because Homer had told them a pure fiction  --  that his grandfather was Gen. Robert E. Lee . After a splurge of publicity in the San Francisco papers , planted , it seems , by the talkative Lea himself , the " secret military agent " sailed in July , 1899 . To his campus friends he made a terse farewell speech . He said , " I go to topple the Manchus from their ancient Dragon Throne . " What made that speech most remarkable is that he said it , according to Newmark , as coolly as he had been wont to say " And I hold four aces . " On his way to China , Lea passed through Hawaii , Guam and the Philippines . All along what has now become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his careful maps and notes on its possible defense and probable attack . And everywhere , of soldiers in the Pacific , he asked over and over , " Why ? Why ? Why ? " Arriving in Canton , he met , according to plan , agents of the Po-Wong-Wui who gave him a letter to the empress ' prime minister , Kong Yu Wei , in Peking . Under the very nose of the reactionary empress dowager , Kong was covertly working to raise a volunteer army with which to overthrow her and restore to power her liberal nephew , Emperor Kwang Hsu , imprisoned by the empress for advocating Western ideas . Liberal forces within the Manchu court still believed that if the throne could be Occidentalized and China opened up to Western material progress , as Japan had been , the prosperity and greatness long fled from China would return . To this end they conspired in daily peril of their lives . The crafty , tyrannical old empress hated and feared " the white devils " and all their works , for she knew that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ugly reign . Traveling from Canton by palanquin through hundreds of miles of China , Lea arrived in Peking secretly . In the Forbidden Palace itself he kept a prearranged midnight rendezvous with the prime minister . The prime minister was frankly surprised to see a crippled boy . " What can you do ? " he asked . " I have come , " Lea said , " to help you save China from the old tigress . To rescue Kwang Hsu . To lead your armies to victory . " The prime minister smiled , " You are very young to do all that . " Lea replied , " I am the same age Napoleon was at Rivoli . " The prime minister laughed , but at the end of their conversation he was impressed as greater men were yet to be . He ordered Lea to proceed to Shensi , there to take over a body of volunteers . As Lea left , accompanied by only two palanquin bearers and a guide , a secret emissary accosted him with a small package and a scroll . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hsu and a commission as lieutenant general in the Army of the Emperor . At least , this is Homer Lea 's own version . This part of his story has often been violently denied ; it has never been either disproved or verified . The Shensi troops which General Lea had been sent to command were 300 miles inland . Within 100 miles of his destination a runner brought him disastrous news . The empress dowager 's palace spies and her eunuchs had overheard the prime minister 's interview with Lea . She had instantly ordered the beheading of all Kong 's sympathizers . Upon a whispered warning from a friend , the prime minister had fled with a price of $20,000 on his head . On the head of the white devil , Homer Lea , the empress had put a price of $10,000 . The viceroy of Shensi , an appointee of the empress , had already been warned of the plot , and he had lured the officers of Lea 's army into his palace under pretext of surrendering the province to them . The next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city walls . General Lea sent the runner back with a message to the troops , telling them to retreat into the mountains , and coolly proceeded on his way to join them . The empress ' evil hand had touched off the spark that started the hideous holocaust called the Boxer Rebellion , in which all Chinese loyal to the Manchu throne tried to purge China of white men . Meanwhile , in the distant hills of Shensi , Lea rallied the remnants of Kong 's Reform Volunteers . After several months the American began his march on the imperial palace . When he arrived outside the gates of Peking , the Boxer Rebellion was reaching its hideous climax . The compounds and legations of the white powers , with their white women and children , were under desperate siege , in which the imperial troops participated . It is too much to suggest that Homer Lea and his Reform Volunteers raised that siege . But history records that , much to the mystification of the besieged white defenders , when the American troops under General Chaffee marched into Peking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , commanding several thousand ragged Chinese who had fought by Chaffee 's side against the Boxers , entered with him . The rebellion put down , the empress , with her court and her imperial troops , fled . She was promptly pursued , not by the troops of the allied white powers but by Lea and his ragged army . Waylaid by the empress ' rear guard , his outnumbered troops were killed or dispersed . The little general was abandoned . He took refuge in a Buddhist temple . There  --  again according to a story Lea was very fond of telling at patriotic Chinese banquets when he returned to America  --  a monk dressed a small wound in his arm and gave him food and drink . As he reached out his hand for the cup , the old monk said , " It is a small hand , but it is a great hand . You will yet lead armies and vanquish your enemies . " As the monk spoke , a little bird dropped dead off a branch of a tree outside the temple door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird drops dead from a tree , a great throne will fall .

But I have a friend and he 's never in his life owned aught to cover his feet . " In the end , the ladies left very much pleased with themselves and with Daniel . And Daniel had all the clothes . Next morning it took the offer of three of the caps to get assistance in carrying the clothes down to the riverboat landing . Daniel deferred payment until he arrived at the dock , so that Mr. Johnson should be a witness to his generosity .

The lady looked up at Mr. Johnson . " If my baby she scream when I am not with her , it is rum she likes . You dip the pickle first in rum , and then you give it to her . Yes ? " " No , " said Mr. Johnson . " Rum is not good for an infant . . . . Danny , we must find that wretched child . She 's somewhere , hiding . " Daniel said , " I 'll look in the warehouse . " But he found her at once , long before he got near the warehouse . There were crates and barrels by the hundreds that could have hidden her if she 'd been clever , but she had chosen to hide behind a half-empty sack of cotton , practically in the open . Daniel looked down at her with disgust , his professional pride outraged by such stupidity . Consuela Maria was crying . She had her big black eyes open and her mouth tight shut , but she was crying all the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms pressed tightly against her cheat , and her hair , on the side the tears fell on , was soaking wet . " Get up , " Daniel said . " The boat 's been holding for you . Ai n't you got no shame ? " She had n't . She turned her head and looked up at Daniel , and then she smiled . " Come on , " said Daniel . He grabbed hold of her scrawny arms and pulled her to her feet . " And behave . Or you 'll get a licking . " That was the beginning , and it should have ended with the beginning . Only it did n't , for the reason that Consuela Maria was disobedient and selfwilled and everything a girl , whether she is big or little , should never be . Mr. Johnson called the company to stand in readiness . Then he stationed Daniel at the foot of the gangplank to count the children off from the other passengers for Albany .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
