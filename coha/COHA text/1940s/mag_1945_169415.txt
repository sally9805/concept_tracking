In Russian-occupied Germany the pattern of rule continued to emerge . So did the members of Russia 's former Free Germany Committee . A fortnight ago the Communist and Social Democratic Parties reconstituted themselves and agreed to a joint program ( TIME , July 9 ) . Last week 17 industrial and commercial trade unions were organized under a joint Communist and Social Democratic trade-union committee . Its leaders , both fresh from concentration camps , were Communist exReichstag deputy Roman Chwalek and Social Democratic trade-union leader Otto Brass , who for several years served as chief of his party 's underground work in Nazi Germany . <P> The committee 's program was somewhat vague but militant : " The new free trade unions are called upon to become the organs of the fighting unity of the working class for the purpose of the complete destruction of fascism . The trade unions are called upon to render assistance to the resurrection of the German nation and in healing the wounds inflicted on the world by the Hitlerite war . " <P> Cultural Correctives . For the reeducation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berlin : 1 ) the League of Culture for the Democratic Regeneration of Germany ( whose executive committee consisted of Johannes R. Becher , Communist poet , and three non-Communists ) ; 2 ) The Youth Council for the Eradication of Fascism ( whose secretary is Heinz Kessler , member of the Free Germany Committee and one of its propagandists on the central Russian war front ) . The outstanding feature of these organizations was the collaboration of Communists and Social Democrats-traditional political enemies . <P> Brand-New Party . Also organized in Russian-occupied Berlin last week was a brand-new political party-the Christian Democrats . It was somewhat early to say what it might turn out to be . But it looked like a liberal party intended to represent the middle class . <P> To Marshal Georgi Zhukov , boss of Russian-occupied Germany , the Communist , Social Democratic and Christian Democratic parties offered candidates for the posts of president and vice presidents of the administrations of Saxony , Mecklenburg and Brandenburg in the Russian zone . In no case did the Communists , experts in back-seat political driving , propose one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Promptly Marshal Zhukov accepted the candidates , who took office at once . <P> The President of Mecklenburg is Willi Hoecker ( Social Democrat ) ; of his three vice-presidents two are Communists . The President of Saxony is Rudolf Friedrichs ( Social Democrat ) ; his five vice-presidents include two Social Democrats , two Christian Democrats , one Communist . The President of Brandenburg is Dr. Arthur Steinhoff ( Social Democrat ) ; his four vice-presidents include one Christian Democrat , one Social Democrat , and two prominent members of the Free Germany Committee , Major Bernhard Bechler and Edwin Hornle , onetime Communist Reichstag deputy . <P> Other Germans who have recently risen in the new Reich : Ottomar Geschke , ex-Communist Reichstag deputy ; Colonel Paul Markgraf , Berlin 's new police chief . <P> <P> News of these administrative opportunities last week set members of London 's Free Germany organizations clamoring to return to Germany . To Britain 's Foreign Office , the Free Germany organizations submitted a list of almost 600 German political refugees who now desire repatriation .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
