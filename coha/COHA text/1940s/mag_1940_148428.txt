Antarctica was in the news last week . In Antarctica itself , Rear Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd was starting a 1,000-mile trek from the Bay of Whales . In Philadelphia was celebrated an antarctic centenary-the discovery of the Antarctica Continent by Charles Wilkes . To observe this anniversary , Philadelphia 's well-heeled American Philosophical Society assembled a group of seamy explorers and scientific greybeards to review a century of U. S. polar exploration . They dined sumptuously ( food from Holland 's , Philadelphia 's famed Negro caterers ) , but their talk was of privation and of hungry men : Wilkes , Kane , DeHaven , Hall , Greely , Peary , Stefansson , Bartlett and other polar tough guys . <P> Charles Wilkes was not the first to find antarctic land-that had been done 20 years earlier by Nathaniel Brown Palmer , a Connecticut sealing captain-but he was the first to make enough landfalls to establish an Antarctic Continent . After the War of 1812 , whaling and sealing began to spread into the Antarctic Ocean , and the New England skippers asked the Government for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled its command on Lieut . Charles Wilkes , a scholarly , hot-tempered , opinionated martinet . <P> With a fleet of battered old tubs , inadequate clothing , excellent instruments , he sailed off in 1838 . He had 83 officers , 342 enlisted men , nine scientists . In 1840 he established the existence of 1,500 miles of Antarctic coastline . On the way home he did a lot more exploring , some of it in the South Sea Islands . Not long after dropping anchor off New York in 1842 , Wilkes was attacked in Congress for killing some cannibals who had murdered two of his officers ; also for cruel and inhuman treatment of his men and for disrespect to a superior . He was exonerated by a court-martial . <P> A German mapmaker promptly labeled Wilkes 's antarctic coastline " Wilkes Land , " and cartographers of many another nation followed suit . But not the British . Long afterward an Australian named Sir Douglas Mawson went over the Wilkes route , claimed that Wilkes had made mistakes or misrepresentations . These were attributed by Wilkes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the horizon appear above it ( a phenomenon also seized on by Robert Peary 's defenders to explain Peary 's mistakes in Greenland ) . Later it was shown that Mawson himself had erred because of the same illusions . Finally in 1939 the Australian Government caved in , put Wilkes 's name on nearly all the 1,500 miles of shoreline which he had mapped . <P> Today four great-grandsons of the peppery old sea dog are in the Navy , and two great-great-grandsons are at Annapolis .
