Last week the 38th ( " Cyclone " ) Division moved out of the Louisiana maneuver area and headed back to its permanent quarters in Florida , and the most irreverent venture in military journalism swerved back into something approaching orthodox reporting . But the editors of the Cydoner could look fondly back on three months of unbridled gaggery . <P> The eleven numbers of the Cydoner reflected the pent-up feelings of its sergeant editors. * Its masthead proclaimed that it had " no mission , no policy ... no tactical news of maneuvers and any news about anything else is guaranteed to be strictly unreliable . " But the Cydoner chronicled the plaintive tale of Private Kountze , who stumbled on what he thought was a U.S.O. house . He wondered how the " senior hostess " had 15 flimsy-gowned daughters all approximately the same age . Not until the police raided did Private Kountze know . <P> The Cydoner published a lush collection of pin-up girls each week-and kidded the scanty pants off them . A movie starlet with a guitar was merely " what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Another leggy gal " just happened to fit in this space . " Readers were warned of a classy near-nude : " This girl can take care of her own tactical situation . " <P> No sacred cows obstructed the editors ' free range . The Cydoner 's Colonel Blimp was one General Fivestars , whose troops were always getting lost . Cydoner 's enlisted men did not hesitate to refer to " laws , as amended by Congress to make officers gentlemen . " <P> The cynical Cydoner editors had the satisfaction of knowing that half the division sent the paper home . <P> <P> * The staff included Tipton Blish , Yale graduate ( 1927 ) and onetime man about Manhattan , Nathan Kaplan from the Bloomington ( Ind . ) Evening World , Photographer Edward Andros , who used to run a portrait studio in Mishawaka , Ind. , and Private Grover Page Jr. , son of the Louisville Courier-Journal 's famed cartoonist . Public Relations Lieut . Peyton Hoge conceived the paper 's slant and the division commander , Major General H. L. C. Jones. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
