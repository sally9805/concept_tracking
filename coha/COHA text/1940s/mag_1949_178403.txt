The story had made the rounds in Rome , where newspapers first printed it in August . Hedda Hopper gingerly slipped it into her gossip column last month as a rumor , and Hollywood had buzzed with it ever since . But last week , when Columnist Louella Parsons spread it as fact all over the front pages of the Hearst papers , a nation of moviegoers gawked . Screamed Hearst 's Los Angeles Examiner across eight columns : INGRID BERGMAN BABY DUE IN 3 MONTHS IN ROME . <P> That was about all Louella 's story had to say . The news , she said , came " straight from Rome , " the latest scene of Ingrid 's celebrated romantic entanglement with 43-year-old Italian Director Roberto ( Open City ) Rossellini , for whom she had renounced her husband and her career . <P> " Is n't That Enough ? " Two days before Louella broke the news ( and then burst into tears because stern journalistic duty had driven her to it ) , the Italian newspaper Il Tempo had noted that Ingrid was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty from her seat . " And it was no secret in Rome that a tall Sicilian physician had examined Ingrid and then blabbed . <P> Newsmen seeking confirmation and comment searched in vain for Ingrid 's husband , Dr. Peter Lindstrom , who has not seen her , except for a grim two-day visit , since she went to Italy in March to make a " different " movie . " Lolly " Parsons ' story was two days old before anyone penetrated the Roman seclusion of Ingrid and Director Rossellini . Then the New York Times 's studious Vatican correspondent , Camille M. Cianfarra , interviewed them in Ingrid 's apartment . While the Swedish actress poured strong black coffee , Reporter Cianfarra managed to ask whether she was to become a mother early next year . <P> Snapped Rossellini : " Whether she is or is not is nobody 's affair . I think that report deserves neither denial nor confirmation , because it is an attempt to pry into the private life of a woman who , to assert her right to her own life , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough ? " <P> " Ashamed by All This . " Ingrid and Rossellini made it plain that they would be married as soon as she gets a divorce from her husband . " Unfortunately , " explained Ingrid , " there have been some difficulties ; otherwise I would already be Roberto 's wife . " Added the director : " Ingrid explained things quite clearly to Mr. Lindstrom last May when she saw him in Messina during a 48-hour visit . Our situation was fully discussed . And I want to make clear that at that time the relationship between Ingrid and myself was absolutely correct . It is not our fault , is it , if we can not get married because Ingrid has been unable so far to obtain a divorce ? " <P> Cianfarra 's dispatch discreetly ducked the obvious question : Did Ingrid look as if she were an expectant mother in her sixth month ? For a colleague , the Timesman had an answer : not at all . That at least threw some doubt on Louella 's arithmetic .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
