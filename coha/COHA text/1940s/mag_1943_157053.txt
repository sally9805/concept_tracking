One of the most important U.S. task forces of World War II-which may do the enemy as much damage as any that the nation sends overseas-consists of several thousand scientists . In complete military secrecy they all work together in one big building at one big scientific institution on one big problem : wartime applications of and improvements on the electron tube. * <P> The incredible accuracy of U.S. naval guns at Casablanca , which at 26 miles smashed the hull of the French battleship Jean Bart in two salvos , was a triumph for the electron tube . Declared Rear Admiral Stanford C. Hooper last week : " Radio directed and reported the destruction . " Even at the very hour that war began the electron tube was the first to serve the nation . On Dec. 7 , 1941 the electron tube caught the mutter of Japanese aircraft when they were 132 miles away from Pearl Harbor . <P> No man can see 132 miles , or even 26 , and the men at Pearl Harbor and Casablanca were no exceptions . But the electron tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear , feel , taste , remember , measure , count and talk . Unable to think and without a conscience , the tube is still less than human . But with proper accessories it far exceeds the human senses ( except taste and smell ) in keenness . <P> Its vision , for instance , allows it to " see " beyond the horizon , through fog and clouds , in black dark . It can " see " through stone and steel to detect invisible internal flaws . It can " see " the whiskers on a disease germ that is only a speck in the best microscope . <P> With electron tubes any combat unit , even a plane streaking across the night sky above the clouds , is in close touch with its command post . Army headquarters in Australia , Iceland , Tunisia , China are neighboring plugs on a single electronic switchboard . <P> When war ends , the new war-born developments will " go to peace . " Already electron tubes of various forms can accomplish miraculous things : <P> &gt; Count and sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thickness of materials to a millionth of an inch . <P> &gt; Measure , control and record pressure , humidity , temperature , color , acidity . <P> &gt; Detect fog , smoke , dust and vapors that are invisible to the eye , and take protective action . <P> &gt; Control any machine operated by a relay switch-manipulating doors , elevators , conveyors , furnaces , traffic . <P> &gt; Operate machines by remote control-in lighthouses , electric substations , pumps , planes , ships ( TIME , Jan. 18 ) . <P> &gt; Concentrate heat in small areas even deep within the insides of larger objects-to bake , dry , glue , stitch , anneal , weld , rivet . <P> &gt; Motivate many medical treatments-by-heat which come under the heading of diathermy . <P> The electronic industry was no dwarf in the peacetime U.S. Then nearly 150 million tubes , of more than 400 different types , were produced in a year . Radio equipment production jumped from well under half a billion dollars in 1941 to $1 billion in 1942 . Plans for 1943 will bring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses to which tubes are being put but these totals tell the story of their myriad usefulness .
