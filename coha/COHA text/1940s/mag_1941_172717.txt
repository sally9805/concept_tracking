Disorder flared dangerously in Hitler 's New Order last week . In Norway , most persistent trouble-maker for the German conquerors , spontaneous outbursts against Nazi rule broke out from Oslo to Narvik . <P> Disquiet in Oslo reached a crest when 2,000 workers in the Akers shipbuilding yards went on strike .

Oslo was placed under a 7 o'clock curfew , transportation was stopped after that hour , public meetings were prohibited , wireless sets seized , dancing forbidden . Boy Scouts , Girl Guides and Salvation Army organizations dissolved . <P> To baptize the decree in the usual blood bath , Nazis sentenced and shot Viggo Hansteen , chief legal adviser to Norwegian trade unions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others were sentenced to imprisonment and hard labor . <P> By no means the first direct action taken by labor in Norway , the strike topped off a long series of incidents .

It takes food to make the first fight , hunger to make the latter .
