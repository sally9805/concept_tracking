Alarm Signal ? Business inventories in February , said the Department of Commerce , reached a new high of $42,750,000,000 , up 3% from the month before . With a worried frown , the Department noted that only 30% of the $757,000,000 increase was due to a seasonal slack in sales ; the rest was caused by growing buyer resistance . <P> <P> All Clear . Western Union Telegraph Co. , in the red so deeply a year ago that some suggested that the Government take over , staged a remarkable comeback . For 1947 , it reported $11,000,000 profit-enough to pay a $1-a-share dividend . The reasons : new rates on Government traffic and windfall business during the telephone strike . <P> Sparkler . Brown &; Williamson Tobacco Corp . brought out its Raleigh cigarettes in a shiny new aluminum foil package , now being tried out in Detroit . The pack , stronger and more moisture-proof than paper , was developed by Reynolds Metals Co . Raleigh hopes to offset the higher material cost by production savings in wrapping the single-sheet unit . <P> Dispersal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making F4U-5 Corsair fighter-bombers for the Navy at Stratford , Conn , will move to a Navy plant at Dallas , Tex . to build F6U-1 jet-propelled Pirates . While the move is under way , Corsair production will be tapered off at Stratford and jet production started at Dallas . The shift , which will take several months to complete , is under the Government 's policy to disperse war plants . Other reasons : Dallas has better flying weather and a larger airfield for experimental flights . <P> Reopened Door . After months of negotiations Cities Service Co. , and Antonio Bermudez , boss of Mexico 's government-owned oil monopoly Pemex , signed a historic agreement in Mexico City . The deal brought a major U.S. oil company into Mexican oil development for the first time since 1938 , when expropriation drove most foreign companies out . Under the deal Cities Service will set up a Mexican subsidiary ( Mexico-Cities Service Petroleum Corp. ) to provide the capital , and presumably the machinery and technical help , for Pemex 's development of a million-acre tract in northeastern Mexico . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
