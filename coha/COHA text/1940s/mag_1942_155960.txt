When a democratic nation scraps democratic processes , it may be because the machinery merely needs overhauling . Uruguay 's trouble was a constitutional " reform " dreamed up in 1934 to keep the Government of revolutionary President Gabriel Terra from shaking apart . The new Constitution arbitrarily gave three of nine Cabinet posts and an equal division of Senators to the leading opposition party ( provided , as invariably occurs , that the two leading parties together poll a majority ) . This law has been a thorn in the democratically elected Government of President Alfredo Baldomir . <P> Led by General Luis Alberto de Herrera , the oppositionists became obstructionists . Some were pro-Ally , some were pro-Axis ( and were glad that nearby Argentina and Chile still maintained Axis relations ) , but all the Herreristas were anti-Baldomir . They used Uruguay 's grant of air and naval bases to the U.S. as a political football . Last week , when Baldomir 's supporters were dozing , they sneaked through the Senate a 10-to-6 vote censuring the Government policy of continental solidarity and hemisphere defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , marched troops to danger points in Montevideo . He postponed the Presidential election scheduled for March 29 . He announced that a Council of State would govern-and prepare a new reform to remedy the 1934 reform-until a plebiscite and the postponed Presidential election are held . He accepted Minister of War Julio A. Roletti 's resignation because of " ill health , " gave the post to Foreign Minister Alberto Guani " temporarily " - i.e. , long enough for wise old Alberto Guani to make sure of the Army 's loyalty . <P> Herreristas promptly charged that Baldomir was automatically out of office for " violating the Constitution . " Trailed by a pickup crowd , they tried to force their way into the Congressional Hall . Barred by police , they shouted abuse until the police charged , injuring three Herreristas and two bystanders . <P> Throughout the rest of Uruguay the people remained calm . They raised few questions when President Baldomir explained over the radio that he had acted drastically because the Herreristas " wanted a government with a Nazi attitude . " They accepted his statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white-collar and working classes , which form the main Government support-cheered when President Alfredo Baldomir pledged : <P> " Uruguay will comply faithfully and honorably with all obligations undertaken , especially in the field of inter-American solidarity .
