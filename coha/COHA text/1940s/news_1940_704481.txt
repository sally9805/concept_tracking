txt Floating Bridge Proposed One Connecting Manhattan and Staten Island Is Recommended The remarkable floating bridge now under construction at Seattle , across Lake Washington , may be of interest to New York in connection with a plan I propose for connecting Staten Island directly with Manhattan  --  a plan which would add immensely to the wealth and welfare of the city . It contemplates a bridge of the kind mentioned , or , in lieu of that , a causeway of similar construction to the one connecting Key West with the mainland , between Ellis Island and Robbins Reef , a distance of three and a half miles , with a tunnel from one end of it , one mile long , to the Battery and another of half that length from the other end to St. George . The viaduct should follow a straight line along the edge of the shoal between the two points mentioned , where the water has an average depth of about twelve feet at low tide . Both the tunnels and viaduct ought to have sufficient width for rail and vehicular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ width , it would serve as a dock alongside which ships could lie as they do in European harbors . The great value of such a dock three and a half miles long with direct connection at any point along it to rails or truck is obvious . Increased Land Values The increase in value which the plan would soon create on Staten Island is also obvious . Some idea of it can be had by contrasting present land values on the two sides of the Narrows , a difference due entirely to the difference in transit facilities . At Bay Ridge land is worth about $125,000 an acre , or at least that is what I paid not long ago for the three and a quarter acres in the block bounded by Ridge Boulevard , Colonial Road , Seventy-second and Seventy-third Streets . Vast areas on Staten Island , which could be more quickly reached if this plan were in operation , are now worth only from $5,000 to $10,000 an acre . Moreover , the Staten Island land is more beautifully located and capable of being put to more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought within about seven minutes of Manhattan , for every train across the bay would he express . The tunnels would cost hardly as much as the proposed one , two miles long , across the Narrows , and it is probable that they would be used by at least ten times as many people . The extra cost would consist only of the viaduct , whether floating or stationary , and that would be comparatively inexpensive , for otherwise one of such great length could not have been built at Key West ; but even if its cost were very great it would be justified by the increased taxes to be derived from Staten Island . No such increase could be expected from a tunnel at the Narrows . Indeed , it is doubtful if that would have any material effect on land values , for to reach Staten Island from Manhattan by it and the Fourth Avenue subway would require at least forty minutes , or about twice as long as by ferry and six times as long as by the plan proposed . Use for Stapleton Piers Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in land values , but it would have other consequences of farreaching importance . incidentally , the city 's $40,000,000 investment in piers at Stapleton , of little value now , would become the most valuable we have . The city would also be relieved of the cost of the ferry , while the three great bridges from Staten Island to New Jersey , now little used , would immediately be supplied with abundant traffic and afford welcome relief to the Hudson Tunnels and Skyway , for this new route would reduce the distance to Philadelphia and other points south by several miles . If rapid transit were established between Staten Island and Manhattan it would only be a question of time when the plan suggested by me in a letter to you published in 1930 would materialize , viz. , the construction of artificial islands at each side of the Ambrose Channel between Sandy Hook and Rockaway Point as breakwaters , thus converting the lower bay into one of the finest harbors in the world . Such islands could be constructed by simply pumping up sand from the bottom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usefulness as breakwaters , they would doubtless be worth all they cost for recreational purposes and government use . The lower bay would be converted by them into a harbor five miles wide and ten long , with unlimited docking facilities . Additional piers could be built of any length , alongside which ships could berth head on without the inconvenience of the swift currents of the North River , and several hours ' time would thus be saved . The many advantages likely to accrue in the future when the plan is a reality are fairly bewildering . The mile-wide strip of flat land along the southeast side of Staten Island will be ideal for business , while the hill land behind it is the most delightful place of residence to be found in all this region , as I know by many years ' experience of its charm .

Capital Production Wanted To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The more one thinks about the phrase , " Capital not wanted , " quoted in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more ridiculous the statement seems . Perhaps a major cause of bad thinking about capital is the widespread notion that it is a fixed thing . Capital is not something for direct use but is a stage in the process of production . It wears out like any other physical thing and it becomes junk when the demand for its product is shifted or dropped . All capital is subject to risk . Yet , despite heavy casualties , we continue to use it and need it to get along . In the aggregate it grows . Capital has become the marginal determining power in our monetary econ- omy ; so many workers are dependent on it for livelihood . A pessimistic expectancy of directors in capital goods industry throws workers out of income . Repercussions cause further unemployment in the consumption goods field . While they both grow and ebb in seem . ing unison the capital goods industry calls the tune . Pump priming has proved inadequate because of its failure to get capital industries moving . As long as there is refuge in liquidity and a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a depression . Above all things , today needs a resumption of capital production . H. M. BUGGELN . White Plains , N. Y. , Feb. 1 , 1940 . Savings Bank Life Insurance Statements Regarding Classifications and Cost Are Disputed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIDIES : In his letter to THE TIMES Everett N. Hatch exposes me as an insurance bro ? ker , editor , and officer of an insurance brokers ' association . All of this  --  and more ? is true . The implication , however , ' that my views on savings bank life in ? surance are motivated by an ulterior purpose is unwarranted and beside the point . Mr. Hatch states that " there are forty two separate occupational classifications " in the analysis to which I re ? ferred and that " 70 per cent of the policy . holders in the savings bank life in. surance system are properly classified as wage-earners . " Well , the bank 's list of occupations to which I referred was made public recently by Deputy Superintendent of In. surance Paul R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It shows 19 per cent made up of doctors , engineers , executives , lawyers , merchants and teachers ; 27 per cent housewives , students and children under 15 ; 43 per cent of eleven clerical and trade occupations , and 2 per cent unemployed . Where , then , are the forty-two separate occupational classifications and where are 70 per cent of wage-earners ? Mr. Hatch further demands to know why all classes of citizens should not be permitted to enjoy " the benefits of saw ings bank life insurance . " What does he mean by " benefits " ? Could he possibly mean " reduced cost " ? It is true that the sponsors of bank insurance had promised a reduction of from 25 per cent to 50 per cent in insurance rates , due to the elimination of agents ' commission and other items . But a comparison of bank insurance rates with non-participating company rates shows bank rates to be higher ! even after deducting the 4 per cent dividend just announced . They are also higher , including the 4 per cent divi ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dividends at the end of the first year . Where , then , is the bargain ? What do savings banks mean by advertising " low-cost " insurance ? Precisely what do bank policyholders get in their policies to offset the higher cost ? Where is the much-talked-about saving of the agent 's commission ? The savings bank life insurance system was subsidized by the State to the extent of $25,000 during the first year . Now it stands " on its own . " Policyhold ? ers may therefore look forward to still higher costs in the future . S. NICOLL SCHWARTZ . New York , Jan. 30 , 1940 . Civil Service Inconveniences To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The United States Civil Service Com . mission is accepting applications for typist positions . In examining the requirement sheet I observed a very inter ? esting paragraph . Applicants , it said , must bring to the examination not only a typewriter but also a table . No mention made of chairs. , Perhaps the commission has made ar ? rangements whereby they will provide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical examination , for ruptured candidates will thus be dis . qualified . Another point . Subway agents are in. strutted to . bar individuals carrying bulky packages . The Eighth Avenue line is particularly strict in the application of this rule . On the date of the test will this regulation be waived and cit izens be permitted to transport furniture and typewriters  --  all for a nickel ? Or must competitors hire a taxi to and from the examination ? B. LEVENSON . New York , Feb. 1 , 1940 . City Salary Cuts Opposed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : As one of hundreds of low-salaried city employes , I wish to protest the tendency of the current economy drive to affect those who can least afford an additional burden . I wonder if the Citizens Budget Commission , which has backed Mayor La Guardia 's ill-advised economies so valid antly , reali - just what it is doing .

That sum is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel justified in saying that if cuts are imperative they should be made elsewhere , where they will not be imposed upon those earning less than $1,200 yearly .
