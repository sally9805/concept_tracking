In the large , airy Comedor Popular ( people 's dining room ) * off the Plaza Espana , in Caracas , diners smacked their lips over a favorite dish : rice and black beans . Their approval marked the success of a significant experiment . For a long time , Dr. Nacio Steinmetz , + a Polish refugee scientist , had worked to develop a vitamin-rich soybean to look and taste like the common black bean which is the chief source of protein for millions of Latin Americans . The diners at the Comedor Popular had eaten the product of his work without knowing that it was anything more than the plain black bean . <P> On a plantation bought for him by the Venezuelan government , Steinmetz had raised soybeans , crossbred them . Finally he had a black soybean . He named it Santa Maria . Slightly smaller and softer than the common bean , it has none of the bitter aftertaste of the ordinary soybean . More important , it is chock full of proteins and contains all the known vitamins except C. One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve pints of milk , items always scarce in the Latin American diet . It is also cheaper than the regular bean : 1.50 bolivars per kilo ( 45 ) instead of 2.50 bolivars ( 75 ) . <P> For food-importing Venezuelans , Santa Maria was pretty important . Said ex-Agriculture Minister Eduardo Mendoza : " This can change the national economy of our country . " <P> <P> *A government institution , a chain of these dining rooms feeds daily some 10,000 adults , 36,000 children . Cost of a meal : one bolivar ( 30 ) . <P> + No kin to General Electric 's late , great Physicist Charles Proteus Steinmetz.
