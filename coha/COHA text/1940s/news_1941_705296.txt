txt James F. Dewey , Federal labor mediator , told the Eaton Manufacturing Company and the C. I. 0 . United Automobile Workers that unless the strike which has closed the company 's five plants was ended immediately he would " take drastic action . " In an ultimatum which he said was delivered on the authority of the National Defense Commission , he demanded that the company reopen its Saginaw , Mich. , plant where the current dispute originated ; that it rehire all U. A. W.-C . I. 0 . members from a former strike ; that the union call off its present walkout , and that a settlement be made within twenty-four hours . Four of the company 's five plants which are on strike are manufacturing defense equipment , including airplane engine parts . Asserting that " this is an urgent matter of national defense , " Mr. Dewey continued : " I have been authorized by the National Defense Commission and the Federal Labor Department to insist that the plants be reopened at once . I am asking the company to rehire the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant and to settle the controversy after the plants are operating again . " The company made an agreement with the U. A. W.-C . I. 0 . in December to rehire the strikers in the Saginaw plant within seven days , but they did not do it . We are going to insist in the name of the government that they carry out that agreement . " He called for return of the workers on " a temporary basis " pending a settlement of the dispute and he predicted acquiescence in this procedure within the twenty-four hours he set . Normal Operation at Saginaw The Saginaw plant was operating today under almost normal conditions , following the attempt of C. I. 0 . unionists yesterday to keep A. F. of L. employes out . During a melee several pickets and policemen were injured , and , at the orders of Governor Murray D. Van Wagoner , about 200 State troopers were sent to the scene to prevent further disorders . Soon after the trouble developed , the C. I. 0 . employes of the Detroit plant struck and today the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at Cleveland , were shut . The Detroit plant employs 600 men and those at Marshall and Battle Creek about 300 each . Mr. Dewey said that if his suggestion were accepted the plants // 24-IIOUR LIMIT SET ON DEFENSE STRIKE // would reopen on Thursday and that ' meantime he would remain in Detroit trying to effect the settlement rather than go to Cleveland where the company 's main office is located . He also said that he was seeking the company 's cooperation first " because that is the crux of the matter . " He kept in touch with both sides this evening and the Detroit office of the Federal Labor Mediation Board , acting independently , was in communication with company officials in Cleveland in an effort to reach an understanding . Question of Rehiring Strikers The company , Mr. Dewey said , made its agreement to rehire about 300 men at Saginaw on Dec. n in a letter to David T. Roadley , Federal labor conciliator in Cleveland . On the basis of this letter and the accompanying agreement , the C. I. 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 . has a contract covering four Eaton plants with a clause that employes in others may come under the C. I. 0 . contract if they desire . The Saginaw plant , however , has a contract with the A. F. of L. , although the C. I. 0 . claims the majority of employes there . It was out of this situation , together with a demand for a plant election by which the . C. I. 0 . hoped to gain control at Saginaw , that the strike developed in December . Mr. Dewey said that his proposal did not concern any right to strike but that its aim was " to get the plants back in operation and the unions to settle their disputes before arbitration boards and not in the streets . " R. J. Thomas , U. A. W.-C . I. 0 . president , said today that his union was prepared to go back to work immediately if the December strikers were rehired . " That is what we have been asking right along , " he added . " The management agreed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they failed to live up to their agreement , and so we had to call another strike . " We also want a National Labor Relations Board election among the Saginaw employes to determine which union they want to be represented by in collective bargaining . "
