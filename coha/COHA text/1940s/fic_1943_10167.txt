the kind of men who believed astonishingly that privilege placed them above the moral laws of the average citizen . They were , he had decided , a special product of a. special era in American life ; they were born of a period undistinguished by morals and distinguished principally by an undue respect for success , no matter how it was achieved . But they were , too , types that were eternal . The knowledge he had picked up during the afternoon kept gnawing at his brain like a worm . . . Amory Stilham would be tried and very likely go to jail and Amory Stilham was Janie 's father . It was a horrible thing because it would hurt her . The taxicab stopped at the doorway of the hotel . Everything seemed suddenly false and hideous to him , the bright lights of the canopy , the wide carpeted stairs , the people in the huge lobby . The monstrous size of the hotel  --  the last tribute to an age which believed there could be virtue or beauty merely in size or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his sister and brother-in-law . There was something real and solid about them which brought him comfort . Janie liked them at once . His sister was called Mary and she was older than himself . . . thirty-five , Ned told her , but the difference in age had not made any great difference . They were very close to each other because their mother had died when he was seven years old and Mary had been partly mother to him as well as sister . She was very proud of his record at the University of Wisconsinand the way he had gotten on since then . She was a big handsome woman dressed smartly in a mink coat and a small black hat with stiff green feathers . There was warmth about her , not the continual fiery warmth which Janie felt in Ned himself , something reserved and set aside for t hose toward whom he felt tenderness , but a big enveloping warmth . She was a woman who clearly loved her husband and two children , who kept her house well and enjoyed an occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even disappointments and disillusionmentswould not change her . Her husband , whose name was Charlie Evans , was a goodlookingsuccessful fellow . You could tell he was successful by thep101brightness of the steel-rimmed spectacles he wore , by his extraordinaryappearance of neatness and the twinkle in his brown eyes and the curl of his lips . Everything had gone well for Charlie Evans since the day he was born . He had wanted a wife he loved , children , prosperity and he had all of them . As they came toward her Janie liked them , but more than liking and far more profound was the feeling that they were warm and frank and friendly , that they meant to take her into their lives without reservations because Ned had chosen her and they loved Ned and would be loyal to him no matter what he did . It was a curious sensation , like the comfort of a warm bath after being chilled . It was something she had never met before in her world , except with Great-Grandmother Parkington , and there it was scarcely impressive since it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the men had three and then they went to dinner at " 21 . " In the taxicab gaiety joined them and Ned 's air of preoccupation seemed to fade away . He asked questionsabout Charlie 's factory and the children and people called Hutchinson and Hoffman in South Bend who were old friends and then Mary said , suddenly , " That 's enough , Ned . This is Janie 's evening too . " Janie was grateful to her although she had neither felt bored n : r excluded from their conversation . On the contrary all their talk made her feel pleasant and intimate and in a curious way it made her eel that through Ned she belonged to something , that somehow she had already acquired solidity and roots , simply by being n love with him . At " 21 " Janie bowed to Foxworthy the playwright and two actresses and a girl who had been at boarding school with her . Ned bowed across the room to a thin man with gray hair who he said was a man from the department in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invaded it to escape from the world into which she was born as the child of Amory and Helen Stilham , a fact which had bred in her a sense both of futility and inferiority , for all the things which an earlier generationhad regarded as the greatest of advantages , appeared to Janie only as handicaps . As a child of fifteen she had become aware thatp1O2 she was imprisoned by circumstances  --  by being rich and the greatgranddaughterof Mrs. Parkington , by being the daughter of Amory Stilham , by the very schools where she had received a not too sketchy education , by the certainty that wherever she went men with cameras seemed to appear magically out of walls to photograph her . And the knowledge had produced in her a kind of sadness , as if there were a curse upon her , as if some spell placed on her by a wicked fairy had made it impossible ever to exist as herself , to live as her great-grandmother had been able , despite everything , to live the whole of her long life . Because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were whole worlds , unknown , unexplained , which were barred to her , shut away from her by all her " advantages . " That was why Ned had seemed wonderful to her  --  because he came from a world outside her own , and that was why tonight the presence of Mary and Charlie made her happy . This very restaurant , which to her was a commonplace affair , was to them exciting . Ned had suggested ( lining here because there would be people , famous or notorious , whom Mary and Charlie would find " interesting . " That was what she liked about Mary and Charlie  --  they would be excited and gay tonight and tomorrow they would forgetall the people they had seen because they had a life of their own which was perfectly satisfactory and pleasant . They were amused by the people she pointed out to them as they would be amused by animals in a zoo , and they would be honestly and simply impressed and then afterward in their own very real world they would forget all about them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a world Janie had never known but it seemed to her the most wonderful thing in the world . There were times when her own world seemed out of scale , dwarfing her , filling her with a sense of insignificance and futility . There were times when it seemed to her that she was only a ghost moving in shadows . But Ned was real . Watching him across the table , she knew how  --  real he was . There were times when she felt much older and wiser than he and times when she felt like a child beside him , a child for whom he felt great solicitude and tenderness . It seemed to herp103that the wisdom and knowledge which gave her the feeling of maturity were wisdom and knowledge that were destructive because they were tired and old and came out of a weary world . Sometimes it seemed to her that it was a world in which there was no faith in anything , but only a kind of deadness which oppressed her own spirit , so that nothing she did appeared to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull . Ned , she knew , trying not to look at him with too much adoration , had changed all that . His mere presence made whatever happened take on an exciting quality . When he was with her the whole world acquired a kind of brilliant coloration . When he was gone it turned drab again , infected by a dull and embalmed quality of monotonous security . And this , her sad adolescent wisdom told her , was not simply because she was in love . There was a quiet , hidden animal vitality in him that manifested itself in odd sporadic ways , in abrupt chuckles , in sudden violent enthusiasms , in the very way he carried himself . But above all he had faith ; he believed in what he was doing ; he wanted ardently to make the world in which he lived a better , richer , more excitingplace  --  not for himself alone but for all people  --  the common ones , the dull ones , the stupid ones , the underprivileged ones . That was something she had never encountered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something she could not hope to explain to her own mother and father . Only Great-Grandmother Parkington might understand , but in the presence of Granny she never felt able to speak of such things lest before the old woman 's vast wisdom and experience , she should seem shy and childish . Across the table from her , Ned watched her , conscious of her happiness , and pleased because it was clear that she liked his sister and brother-in-law and that they liked her . In some ways she was , he knew , older than any of them , but in others she was a baby . That , more than anything else , was what made him love her ; her sad precocious wisdom fascinated him and her childishnessfilled him with a desire to cherish and protect her . He was an ardent young man , but less simple than he seemed , and he had been endowed by God and nature with a kind ofp104creative imagination . It was inclined to take hold of a situation and then build it toward a dramatic conclusion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to make his mind attractive to other people , but it also made him the victim of worry and the anticipation of tragedies and disasters which rarely achieved reality . It made of him a worrier , and that was what he was doing now  --  worrying madly , almost insanely over Janie and the future . Even the champagne did nothing to dull the leaping , vaulting imagination . The knowledge about her father which he shared with none of the others , kept gnawing at his happiness , keeping him outside the gaiety of the others . The figure of Janie 's father , the embezzler , the swindler , the sanctimonious crook , cast its shadow over the whole evening , while one part of his mind kept working , active as flame , creating a future of suffering which might never become reality . There was no possibility of doubt any longer regarding the guilt of Amory Stilham. 1 le knew , perhaps better than anyone , because he had collected much of the evidence - which had closed the trap . Watching Janie , gay and happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him , he turned the doomed future over and over again in his mind , speculating whether he should prepare her for the horror that was to come or to let someoneelse tell her . For a wild moment it occurred to him that she might refuse to marry him because he had played a part in the investigation or because she felt , fantastically , that she could not bring upon him the disgrace of marrying the daughter of a swindler . It was all a nasty , complicated business of which he and Janie were victims . There had been , he knew well enough , a moment dust after he had gone to spend the week end at Amory Stilham 's house in the country , when he could have turned back , when he could have forced himself not to see Janie again . And he knew too that such a course would have been much wiser . It would have been easier for him , it would have been better for his own future . But he was aware too that he was not like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which made his brain a brilliant ,  |p105successful  instrument , made him fall in love , recklessly , with all the violence of a lusty nature . He knew that by all the rules , Janie was not the right person for him . There was her name and her wealth and the unwelcome and snobbish attention of newspapers and public , and there was the curious background of enchanted stability which had surrounded her since she was born . There were so many things she did not know , about people , about the world , about how things worked in life , because her own life had never had any relation to the reality of people but only to the reality of a world , coddled and protected , wrapped in cotton wool , a world which was utterly doomed . Even her faint childish efforts to escape had only brought her into the borders of a world that was equally false , a world of writers and actors and idlers which fed upon itself , continually devouring its own entrails and consuming its own vitality . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , but this reason was bereft of authority because he loved her and felt a passionate need to rescue her , for he was still young enough to believe in St. George and the Dragon . Wisdom had not yet dulled ardor nor had experience made him crafty . He was young and he was in love and as with Janie herself , there was a part of him that was very wise and a part of him that was very young . There was , for neither of them , any escaping their own muddled generation . His sister , knowing him so well , was aware throughout the evening that he was troubled and suffering , but knowing him well , she also knew that there was nothing she could do to help him . Whatever the trouble was he would have to fight his way out of it , for he was like that . He had always been since he was a stubborn little boy . After dinner they went to see a musical play of Cole Porter 's and then to Monte Carlo and El @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few knew Ned and none of them knew his sister and her husband . It was a conventional evening , the most conventional in the world , and in a way the emptiest and deadliest in the world , but Ned 's sister and her husband loved it and in South Bend they would talk of it for a little time after they returned . It was for them the evening had been arrangedp106and they had enjoyed themselves , making Janie happy although to her it was old stuff and tiresome . Before the evening was over their enjoyment had dulled even the edge of Ned 's private misery . When they had left Ned 's sister and brother-in-law at the Waldorf , they drove in a taxicab to Janie 's house in Sixty-eighth Street . On the way Ned took her hand again . " They are nice , are n't they ? " he asked , a little strained and nervous , because to him it made so great a difference . " I think they 're lovely . I think they 're the nicest people I ever met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But I mean it , honey . " They were silent then for a little while and happy with the simple happiness of being together . And presently he said , " You would n't let anything come between us , would you ? " And he was aware of the banality and the inadequacy of his words . " No , honey . Why do you ask that ? " " For no reason at all . . . only because I 'm afraid sometimes . " " You know I would n't . " " Would you marry me tomorrow ? Would you run away ? " " I would if it was necessary . . . if it really had to be done . But I 'd rather wait . You see , my mother would like a wedding and my great-grandmother too . ' here 's been so much in our family that was irregular , my mother makes a fetish of what is regular . She 'd want everything done right . " She laughed suddenly . " And I 'd rather like it myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once . " At the door he said " Good night " and kissed her , but there was no satisfaction , no pleasure in it , because the shadow of his worry came between them . She said suddenly , " What is it , darling ? There 's something wrong ? " He laughed , " No , nothing . I 'm tired . I 'm not used to staying out all night . "  | " Call me tomorrow before noon . " " Yes . " She went inside and closed the door and as she did so depressionsettled over her . It came down like a veil dimming the world all about her  --  the big hallway , the great stairway , the shadowy spaces of the overelegant drawing room . She was aware as she started up the stairway of the sound of music , very faint and muffled , and thought : Mother must be awake . Often in the night she wakened to hear the same sound and always it meant that her mother was suffering from insomnia and was lying awake on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still shared with her husband . It happened more and more frequently of late . . . the faint sound of music joined with the coming of gray winter dawn . On the second floor she walked along the hall to the sittingroomand knocked . Her mother 's fretful voice said , " Come in , " and as she opened the door Janie saw her lying on the chaise longue in a peignoir , a Shetland shawl about her shoulders . As Janie entered she put down her book , took off her horn-rimmed reading glasses and said , " Oh , it 's you , dear . You 're very late . " " It 's only about four o'clock . " " It does n't matter , " said her mother , " Who did you go out with tonight ? " " Ned . " She divined that her mother probably knew all along that she had spent the evening with Ned . Both of them had avoided speaking his name for a long time now . She went on , " His sister was here from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they like ? " The mother spoke as if she expected her to say they were something out of a zoo . " They were very nice , " Janie said , " I liked them very much . " Then irritably she heard herself saying , " I wish you 'd get up to date , Mother . Nearly all your friends are . Granny is much more up-to-date than you . " " I know , " said Mrs. Stilham , " Your great-grandmother it always perfection . " " Why do n't you take something to make you sleep ? "  | " No , thank you . We 've enough trouble with that in the family . " And Janie knew that her mother meant the Duchess . She went on . " I think I 'm going to make this into a bedroom . I might sleep better if I ' could be alone . Your father is restless and snores . " " I think it would be more civilized , " said Janie . Then she wished quickly that she had not spoken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " What do you mean by that ? " " I do n't know . Nothing at all . " But she did mean something . She meant that it seemed evil for two people who hated each other to go on sharing a room . For she knew that her mother and father had hated each other for a long time in the most dreadful way , pretending that they did not hate each other , even sharing a room as if painfully to convince themselves that the truth was not true . It was a curious fetish , Janie sometimes thought , this worship of the idea of marital fidelity and happiness in a day when it no longer really mattered very much to anyone but the persons themselves . It must be awful to wake in the night and find yourself alone in the same room with someone you hated . . . night after night , on and on , forever , until you died . Moved by a sudden pity for the tired woman with the droopingmouth , she said , " Is there anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm milk or something ? " " No . Nothing . " " Then I 'll go to bed . " She started toward the door but her mother said , " Wait a moment , Janie . There 's something 1 want to ask you . " " Yes , Mother . " " Sit down , please . " " Yes , " said Janie , and sat down on the edge of a Louis Quinze armchair . " It 's about this Ned . I should like to know what is going on . You see a great deal of him . You seem to have dropped everybody . . . everything else . " " Yes . " " Are you in love with him ? " Quietly Janie said , " Yes . "  | " Seriously ? " " Yes " A curious look came into her mother 's face . " Nothing else has been going on ? " Janie felt suddenly angry , not at the suspicion but at the look in her mother 's eye and the tone of her voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Young people are so very odd nowadays . " " You talk as if you were a hundred years old . " " Sometimes I feel as if I were . " Janie was thinking : It might as well be now . I 'll tell her now and get it over with . So aloud she said , " I 'm going to marry him . " Her mother took the news with apparent indifference . She was silent for a moment and then asked , " You 're sure about it ? It 's not just an idea ? " " No . " Again her mother was thoughtful . Then she said , " I hope you understand how great a disappointment this will be to your father ? " " I do n't see why it should be . " " You know perfectly well . Your father wanted you to marry someone he knew , someone out of your own world . I feel the same way although that 's probably of no importance either to him or you . " " I 'm sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her mother was behaving as she knew she would behave . She would never say , " You must not do this . I forbid it . " She did not even grow angry . But she would work against it for the rest of her life , quietly , unscrupulously , insidiously , spreading doubts , tearing down confidence and happiness . Suddenly Janie felt very tired , as if the long slow discontent and unhappiness of this rich house had become an unbearable burden . Her mother was still talking , " I hope you realize what this means ... that you 'll have to give up all your friends , that you 'll probably have to live in some outlandish place , with outlandish people . It wo n't be at all the way you think it will be . "  | " I 've thought how it will be , " said Janie , " And it 's exactly what I want . " " You 're a child , Janie . You do n't know how it will be . You 've been given all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to throw theist all away . " Janie did not answer at once . When she spoke , she asked , " Were you in love with father when you married him ? " " Yes , of course I was . " " It was n't just the suitable thing to do ? " " I was very lucky . Your father was also considered an excellentmatch ... and rightly . " " An excellent snatch , ' Janie repeated quietly , as if speaking to herself . " That 's what I said , " repeated her mother . " And do n't deceive yourself . In the long run that means something . " Janie did n't answer her . Her mother said , " I only ask one thing . Do n't hurry into this . It seems to Inc that Ned might have told your father and me . " " He did n't , " said Janie , " because I asked him not to . " She was suddenly angry now , for the sake of Ned and the fashion in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to spare him an idiotic conversation . " " And what , pray , do you mean by that rude remark ? " " 1 mean that neither of you could possibly understand about Ned or what he is . " " I think that I understand very well . . . only too well . He is a Red , a Communist . He 's working for all the things which aim to tear down what has taken your father and men like him their lifetimes to build up . " Janie stood up . " You see , Mother , It 's quite useless trying to talk about it . " " Of course , " said her mother , " If you are determined to go through with it we 'll back you up and have a wedding and put the best face possible on the whole thing . " And now Janie was really angry . " You need n't bother about the wedding . You need n't trouble yourself to put any face on at all . " She stood up and walked toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel about it . I only know I 've got to get out of this God-damned bedeviled house . " She went out the door , aware that her mother was rising to follow her . When she was halfway up the stairs , to her own room , she heard her mother 's voice calling plaintively , " Janie , Janie ! " But she paid no heed and presently she heard the door of her mother 's sitting-room close again , and going into her own room she threw herself on her bed in the darkness and began to cry . She cried out of weariness , out of anger and partly out of pity for the tired , discontented woman with the drooping mouth belowstairs who could not sleep . When she stopped crying and began to take off her clothes , the light of morning was already coming through the windows . The distant faint music from the radio belowstairs went on and on . When Ned called in the morning she did not tell him anything of the conversation with her mother . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one o'clock train . How long he would be there he did not know but he would send her a wire as soon as he discovered . His sister and brother-in-law were leaving at noon . They sent her their love . They had enjoyed the party the night before . They wanted her to pay them a visit in South Bend . His voice was deep and alive and the sound of it drove away the sense of gray depression . He said , " I do n't like to speak of it for fear it wo n't come true but they may have sent for me to give me a promotion . " " Oh Ned ! How wonderful ! " " It might mean that I 'd have to leave New York and go to San Francisco or Chicago . Would you mind that ? " " How do you mean  --  would I mind it ? " " Would you mind going to one of those places with me ? " " Mind it , Ned ? It would be wonderful . " " If that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would probably mean that I would have to go right away . You 'd have to give up the idea of a big wedding . "  | " That would be all right too . " " Well , take good care of yourself . " " And you , honey . " " Good-by . " " Good-by . " But when his voice was cut off the loneliness and sense of depression returned . The whole house , even her own room , had acquired a kind of hatefulness , as houses do in which there exists long , persistent , dull unhappiness . Lying there in the bed , it seemed to her that she had first become aware of its hatefulness when she was twelve years old after she had gone to visit a school friend who lived in the country in Maryland . She and the friend had long since drifted apart so that the very appearance and personality of the friend had become something vague and hazy , but the memory of the house remained clear and bright  --  a roomy , rambling house full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs , a house with a hodgepodge of nondescriptbut friendly furniture with geraniums growing in pots in the windows . It was a house in which there was happiness and it had seemed bright and filled with sunlight even in the wet muddy days of January . After that visit when she returned to the house in Sixty-eighth Street , it became forever a gloomy and depressing place , dark and filled with shadows , even when there was brilliant sunlight in the streets outside . It was a stuffy house , a luxurious house filled with expensive pictures and furniture which never seemed possessed either of life or of order . The effect was that of an extravagant confusion , like that of a luxurious antique shop , as if between them , her parents had sought to buy or achieve by force something they neither possessed nor understood and which somehow would forever elude them . Lying there in her bed , she permitted her mind to examine lazily the subject of houses and almost at once she thought of her great-grandmother 's house . The things with which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this great dreary house where people went in and out day after day , living , eating , sleeping sometimes without ever seeing each other . Yetp113the effect of Mrs. Parkington 's house was quite different . It was a cosy , happy place like the dark warm nest of a weaver bird or an oriole . In it one had not only a sense of happiness but of warmth and utter security . Inside its walls women , even the Duchess , took on a new beauty and brilliance and seemed more attractive . One did not think on looking at a chair : What a pricelesspiece of furniture ; one thought : What a beautiful and friendly and inviting chair . Even the flowers had a different appearance and aura , not only because Mrs. Parkington had taste and sensitivity where flowers were concerned but because the flowers in her house seemed happy , as if they belonged there . And again as had happened many times before , Janie felt a wild and passionate desire to live and grow old as her greatgrandmotherhad done . To be like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire . And suddenly her day became clear . She would have some lunch and go out quietly while her mother was still asleep to the British War Relief headquartersto do what there was to do there . And afterward she would go to Mrs. Parkington 's for tea and perhaps Granny would ask her to stay for dinner . She was dressing when there was a knock at the door and her brother 's voice said , " May I come in ? " When she saw him she thought : What a good-looking boy he is and how ill he looks ! He had the kind of lean overbred look that one finds sometimes in the portraits of El Greco , a lean face with soft beautiful eyes , contradicted by the narrowness and cruelty of the mouth . He was not at all a Parkington . His looks , his great-grandmother said , came from the Blair blood whence , she added , very likely came his recklessness and taste for dissipation . It was nearly forty years since Mrs. Parkington 's son had married a Blair against her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck driver , she had said , but not into a family where eccentricity constantly hovered on the borders of insanity . And now forty years after the marriage a Blair and not a Parkington came into Janie 's bedroom . Girls usually liked him , for the way he wore his clothes , forp114his glib conversation , for his reckless approach , for the beauty of his hands and hair and eyelashes . Janie saw his points but there were times when in the depths of her heart she knew he was perverse and defeated nearly to the point of insanity . Lately she had begun to feel that she was immensely older than he and to treat him like a child . He flung himself down in a chair and said , " Did you have a good time last night ? " " Yes . Wonderful . " " Who were the fresh looking couple ? " " Ned 's sister and brother-in-law . " " From the Corn Belt too ? " " Yes . " " I saw you in the Champagne Room . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I did n't think Maisie would mix too well . " Janie sat in front of her dressing-table and began arranging herLair . In the mirror she could sec the reflection of his face . Suddenlyshe asked , " Are you keeping Maisie ? " He grinned again , " No , I do n't have to keep her . " " You cad , " said Janie , with indifference . " Why not let someone else do the paying ? " " I must say that 's not a very nice point of view . " " Not nice but convenient and practical . " " Is she a nice girl . . . you know what I mean ? " The question seemed to puzzle him for a moment , " Yes , " he said after a while , " We understand each other . " " Does she bore you ? " " Sometimes but when she gets boring I run away . What made you think of that ? " Janie laughed , " I do n't know . I 've always thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind . . . the long stretches of boredom in between . " He laughed , " It is . . . but then it must be true of married life too . Look at Mother and Father . " " It need n't be , " said Janie , " If you marry the right person . "  | " Are you going to marry this Ned what's-his-name ? " " His name is Ned Talbot and you might as well start rememberingit as he 's going to be your brother-in-law . " He sat up in the chair , looking at her sharply . " What are you looking at ? " she asked . " You sounded exactly like Granny Parkington and with your hair that way you look exactly like her in the picture that 's in the library . " " Thanks . You could n't pay me a greater compliment . " She crossed the room to take a fur jacket out of the cupboard . " How 's the work getting on ? " she asked over her shoulder . " All right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office very early . " " There 's no use going to the office . Your friend Ned and his boy friends have killed all the business in Wall Street . " Janie put on her jacket and took down a hat . " I guess it would have died anyway . But I should think Father would like to have you show up at least . " " He does n't notice . The old bastard seems awfully busy nowadays . . . I do n't know what about . " She turned toward him , the hat still in her hand , " I do n't think that 's funny ! " " Hoity Toity , " said jack . " It 's just vulgar and bad manners and fresh . " Jack yawned and stood up , " Well , he is an old bastard . If I did n't have my own trust fund money , he 'd let me starve . He hates me and is ashamed of me . " After a second he added , " And vice versa . " " You might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looked at herself in the glass and then took up her gloves , " I certainly do n't envy you the end you 're headed for . " " Do n't worry , honey , I 'll pull myself together before it 's too late . " He kissed her suddenly , " You 're mighty pretty . This Ned guy is lucky . " " He 's not half as lucky as I am . " " That 's the way to talk . " She felt a sudden swift anger , at what she really did not know.  |p116Perha|ps  it was nerves as much as anything . But she said , " I 'm lucky to get , out of here  --  out of this bloody house . " " You bet you are , " he said , " I 'd get out too but the address is good and it saves me from paying rent . Maybe I 'll scram anyway if it gets much worse . " At the door she said , " Really , Jack , you stink ! " " Thanks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's despair , honey . . . cosmic despair . What 's there to do but enjoy yourself nowadays . . . nothing to do , nothing to interest you . " " Nothing ! Nothing ! Nothing ! " said Janie . " That 's it . That 's what 's the matter with this bloody house . " As she went out the door she heard him saying , " You 're right . A nihilist ! That 's what I am ! A nihilist ! I learned about that last year in Harvard . That 's about all I ever learned there . " She ran down the stairs and out into the street as if she were followed by something unseen , like a child in a dark hallway . Outside it was better . The clouds were gone and there was the warns sunshine of false spring which can turn New York suddenly in the midst of January into a summer city . Yet Janie , walking rapidly toward Fifty-seventh Street , was unaware of the sunshine and the balminess of the air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left her spirits dulled and troubled . It was the thought of Jack which disturbed her , for she was fond of him and sometimes he made her laugh and he was nearer to her than either of her parents perhaps because he understood as well as herself the gray emptiness of their existence . But at the moment she was angry at him . It was as if he had dragged something sordid into the peace of her own room and left it there . It would be there when she returned ; it might always be there . It was as if he had spoiled for her the one room in all the house which was endurable . It had upset her that he had referred to their father as " the old bastard , " not so much because of the cheap irreverence of the epithet  --  shewas aware that her father had no special right to rever/ence  --  but because life in that house , disagreeable as it was , would become unbearable if some sort of facade were not preserved . You had sometimes to pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be respectable if you were to have any selfrespect , and without self-respect the days became intolerable . The spectacle of the hatred between her father and brother was always painful . It was as if they were no relation to each other , as if Jack were the result of some affair her mother had had with another man , an affair which , knowing her mother so well , she knew was not only improbable but impossible . Perhaps , she thought suddenly , it would have been better for her and for all of us . Perhaps it would have made her happier . Jack would have been somebody else . . . not a Blair , mixed up with the Stilhams blighted from birth by indolence and lack of all balance . Again she thought that perhaps Jack was mad ; certainly he was unbalancedwith the kind of irresponsible quality which was only a shade off madness . As she walked she speculated about Maisie . The knowledge that Jack was living with Maisie did not disturb her profoundly ; it was the quality of Maisie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and father openly detested , everything that was abhorrent to them . Her father , she thought , might have a mistress  --  indeed there were times when she was certain of it  --  but no one would ever know about it . He would return every night and share a room with his wife who bored him ; he would keep up the farce of devotion to her in public . No one would ever find out about it . There was something ugly and evil about Jack and Maisie as if the boy had taken up with her out of hatred for his own father and the whole world he had been trained to respect . They had never liked each other . From the time the boy had been old enough to walk and talk , her father had treated him with contempt , because there was in him the Blair liking for music and books and pictures and the theater . ( ' The Blairs might be crazy , she admitted to herself , but they were also gifted and civilized . ) And as Jack grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the real hatred came into full bloom when Jack failed to make his father 's club at Harvard , " the " club whichII$ MRS . PARKINOTONp118always seemed so idiotically important to her father , more important than love or honesty or achievement . When Jack came home for the Easter holidays , her father would scarcely speak to him . It was as if he had been guilty of some unnamable crime for which he was disowned . She thought : If Jack had a stronger character he would have run away from home . It would have made a man of him . But he was not strong and he had not run away . He had compromised until he was twenty-one when he carte into the money from the Blair trust fund and became modestly independent . He had gone on living in the gloomy house simply to annoy his father . Indeed every act of Jack 's seemed designed as part of the wild , half-mad revolt . . . even Maisie . Ile certainly did not love Maisie . During the unpleasant interim in Janie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was n't , she knew , anything very terrible about Maisie . She was simply incorrigible and uncivilized and amoral with a talent for getting into night club brawls and appearing in gossip columns . Maisie was n't revolting against anything ; she was just a very pretty manifestation of nature who called herself Maisie Bernard and had somehow got from a backwoods town in North Carolina to New York . She would n't have minded Maisie at all except that she sometimes got Jack into gossip columns and headlinesby her escapades . No , it was all very difficult and complicated . It was like being weighed down perpetually by a boredom that was too heavy , which you could n't escape . But she was going to escape . She was opposite the statue of General Sherman when a dreadfulthought came to her : What if something happened between Ned and me ? What if something happened to me ? So that I could n't escape . Then I might revolt too . Then I might get to be like Jack . For she felt somehow that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many things  --  the bad Blair blood , the dreariness of the great house , the dislike for her father and mother , the awful sense of fatality and despair which sometimesannihilated all her strength . In the midst of the traffic at Fifty-ninth Street , she found her/self praying : Oh , God ! Do n't let anything happen . Do n't ! Please God ! At the British War Relief office there were things to do and other women to talk to , some of them , like herself , come there to escape from themselves . She gossiped and sold wool and poured tea and had a scotch and soda and listened on the radio to the progress of the campaign in Libya , upset and tense , as if she sought by her own will to change the news of the retreat toward Egypt . And once she thought again : This is a cursed world , in which to be young , for it seemed to her that it was a world in the process of going to pieces , disintegrating all about her before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought up to believe was made for her and would exist forever was already smashed and gone . All that remained of it were small broken pieces integrated and held together by illusion and hatred of all that was superseding it . The big gloomy house was like that and her father 's firm and Wall Street itself . One found the shattered pieces of that broken world in clubs , on Long Island , in dinner parties at big houses like her own  --  a world saturated and corroded with hatred and defeat . Without knowing quite what she did , she avoided these broken fragments because they were depressing and stupid and to her young mind they were frightening because they were already dead . They whined without fighting at all . And she searched with equal blindness for the new world which was to take the place of the old one without ever finding , it , perhapsbecause the new world was not yet integrated , perhaps because her own education had been so bad and so stupid that she had not the vision that was necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of that new world . Ile talked to her about it  --  a new world which would be a great step forward in civilization and the development of democracy . But it was not yet here ; there was nothing even which she might grasp and touch and feel , savoring it as she savored the remnants of the broken world , nothing which had reality , to which she could attach herself . She did not talk of these things to the other women for she had discovered long ago that most of them either understoodp120nothing or were untroubled by their lack of understanding or simply grew angry and called her a Red . It was not in this background , she knew , that one would find the beginnings of the new world . And so she talked of trivial things and gossiped until five-thirty , when she took down her coat and said good afternoon and went in search of her great-grandmother . She had great need of the old lady and her tremendous sense of peace and security . There were times , it seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through some force that came not of her great wealth but from inside herself . She had not called earlier to say that she was coming because Mrs. Parkington was always at home at teatime . As she stepped out of the taxi , she was troubled to discover at the curb a battered old station wagon with the words Dutch Harbor Farm painted on the side . That meant Great-Uncle I Icnry would be there and the thought of Uncle I leery made her feel uncomfortable as drunken or mad people made her feel . It was worse because the time had been so long since she had seen him . For a moment she debated the question of going away again and finally thought : Perhaps he will he leaving soon and Granny will ask me to stay to dinner with her . Taylor opened the door and when she asked , " Is Mrs. Parkingtonalone ? " he said , " No , Miss Janie , Mr. Henry Parkington is there and Lord Haxton . " Again the desire to run away swept over her , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back tomorrow . " " No , Miss Janie . I would n't . I 'm sure Mrs. Parkington would feel very hurt and I 'm sure she 'd like you to meet Lord Haxton . " Then he added with the faintest glint of humor , " Mr. Henry is very quiet today . " " You 'd better announce me . She was n't expecting me . " He went away and while she was making up her face to look her best for Mrs. Parkington 's friends , Mrs. Parkington herselfp121came out of the small sitting-room followed by Taylor . The old lady came toward her and kissed her and suddenly Janie felt warm and secure again . " Well , my dear , I 'm very glad you came , " she said . " I telephonedyour house but they did n't know where to find you . There 's a very old friend of mine here I wanted you to meet . " Then as they walked along the hall , Mrs. Parkington said , " It 's Lord Haxton . He 's over here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war . " In the small sitting-room Uncle Henry was standing before the fire with his back to it , a big , heavy , bearded vigorous old man of nearly eighty . He was dressed in rough farmers ' clothes , corduroy trousers , plaid flannel shirt and a nondescript woolen jacket . With the heat from the fire , he gave off the faint , clean odor of stables . The flames behind him lighted up his thick white hair so that he appeared to have a halo about his rugged sunburnt face . Seated in a big chair by the fire was the stranger who must be Lord Haxton . As they came into the room he stood up . He was old too with silvery white hair , but very thin and straight with a look of extraordinary distinction . It was a very handsome face with finely cut nose and chin , high forehead , flat temples and high cheek-bones . It was fine without being feminine , the last flowering of a type before it went too fine and fell into decadence . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the healthy pinkness of the face . He as , thought Janie suddenly , the handsomest man she had ever seen . Her great-grandmother said , " This is Lord Haxton . He 's a very old friend . I have n't seen him for years until today . " He shook hands with Janie and said that he was glad to know her . Then she had to kiss Uncle Henry because he always expected it and might grow very angry if ' she refused . Uncle Henry , she knew , liked kissing young girls and that only made it worse . He had been in some sort of trouble when he we. ; in his sixties . No one ever spoke of it in the family save in whispers , but everyone knew about it . She hated the feel of his beard but she liked the smell of soap and horses which hung about him . Hep122was really her great-uncle , the old Major 's younger brother by a different mother , and he never seemed to belong to the family . She knew her great-grandmother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as gracefully as possible . Then her great-grandmother said " You should n't drive after dark , Henry . Neither of us is as young as we once were . " " I could n't feel younger , Susie . You need n't worry about me . " " You are certainly very spry . " He was indeed , marrying again and happily , when he was past seventy . The original Parkingtons were certainly prodigious . " As I was saying , " continued Uncle Henry , addressing Lord Haxton , " If England would adopt proper agricultural methods she could feed herself . . . but get an Englishman to change his ways ! Never ! That 's what is the matter ! " He moved away from the fireplace a little and thrust his hands into his trousers pockets , rocking a little on the balls of his feet lilac a young vigorous man of thirty . " Now , I 've got only four hundred acres  --  none of it too good and ninety acres of it in timber but I produce enough on ' it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Haxton scented to shrivel , to become more fragile and overtired . Beside Uncle I Henry he seemed delicate and very old . Mrs. Parkington , watching them , thought : Harry is bored and he is wrong to be bored . He should listen because Henry is a prodigious fellow and is talking sense . Harry was sitting there , listening with a kind of superior politeness , cushioned by a security which had once produced and protected him , but which no longer existed . He was the answer to so much that was happening , to the falling apart of the British Empire , to the shattering of that bright secure luxurious world of which the violets had suddenly reminded her earlier in the day . No , he should be listening to f Henry who loved his four hundred acres and liked common people and the power of all his money and produced a specimen so at the age of seventy-one . Without willing it , she sighed , thinking of Henry 's other four children by his first wife , who was the daughter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different theyp123all were from her own descendants . And her mind wandered back a long way to the time when she had first seen Henry , on the day the Major brought his boy-brother to the Brcvoort , a rugged , awkward lad of fifteen , twenty years younger than the Major himself , with a different mother . And she remembered suddenly the news of Henry 's marriage ten years later to the gardener 's daughter and the scandal it had made and the Major 's fury . But Henry was right and the Major was wrong . The Major had wanted to " be somebody , " to have his daughter marry a duke , to have a great house on Fifth Avenue and a yacht and to know kings . The Parkingtons were common and earthy and the Major had tried to escape his own destiny . But he had failed and had remained common , thank God , until the sordid end in the hotel in Cannes . That was his great quality and he had not been able to escape it , as none of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of destiny . But Henry was right . People called him eccentricand even crazy , but he was not in the least crazy . Like herself he had lived long enough to see all the others who had called him crazy , melt and decay and disappear along with all their fortunes and ambitions . He had lived through the whole of the indecent era , going his own way like a peasant , beyond destruction . And look at him now , standing there like a young man . His children and grandchildren had n't made " good matches " watering the blood with each generation . He had n't allowed them to . And look at him now ! Janie , listening , felt bored with Uncle Henry 's talk of " concentratedfarming " and rotations and fertilizers and soils . Yet she could not help feeling the feminine stimulus of his vigor and masculinity . She suspected that perhaps he had spoiled her **27;8396;TOOLONG by bouncing in without warning . He had taken over Lord Haxton for himself . The signs were there in Mrs. Parkington 's dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder . Granny had meant to have tea with an old beau , talking about the old days and now it was all spoiled by herself and Uncle Henry . She thought : I ought to go away , but even if I went away it would n't make any difference because Uncle Henry wo n't go until he 's ready to . He 's come for a " visit " with Granny and he does n't mean to go until he 's had his fill . And now that he had got going on Lord Haxton , there was no telling when he would leave . She was glad of the excuse to stay . It was very pleasant here , and secure and warm . If she went away there would be no place to go but back to the dreary house with all the expensive furniture . Opposite her , behind the tea tray , Mrs. Parkington had virtuallyceased listening to the discussion between the two men . She managed out of her worldly experience to hear enough of their conversation to follow its trend and permit her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two winch gave the illusion of participation , but her mind lingered in another world , of boredom and disillusionment and weariness . She was aware now , and honest with herself about it , that the call of I larry was a failure ; it had been a failure even before Henry arrived . To be quite honest , Henry had made it better by bouncing in , ruddy and smelling of horse manure . Shc supposed that one should never try to take up old friendshipsafter so many years . Too many things happened in between , to yourself and to the world . Certainly too many things had happenedsince she last saw Harry . . . things which he seemed unaware of , upholstered in his conceit and trust in his own security . He still talked as if there were no danger ; he still quoted John Donne and Milton and Spenser , rather sententiously , as he had always done long ago in a different world . He still talked as if , at most , this war was not serious really , but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought- , went to Munich with Chamberlain and his umbrella and he learned no more there than Chamberlain learned . She saw now , quite clearly , that I Larry was a fool , and that he had always been a fool , for all his record long ago at Oxford and his brilliant career . She wondered suddenly what that career would have been if Harry had had to make it on his own as the Major had done , without privilege and position and . friends . Like so many Englishmen of his kind , his career had been a long record of brilliant failure , going from office to office , from post to post ,  |p125without  ever achieving anything beyond being witty and intelligentand knowing everyone in Europe . Sometimes he had been responsible for tragic blunders but he had gone on and on just the same because , despite the shallowness , he was what the English called " a gentleman . " Henry was really going to town now , in his blunt , vigorous way . He was saying , " In fact there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Statutes of Westminster . It is dead but it has refused to lie down . " It always astonished her how much Henry knew . You thought of him as eccentric and blunt and uncouth and ignorant and all the time he kept hidden a vast amount of information , facts and hard thinking . And she heard Harry saying , " But , my dear sir , you do n't understand the intricacies of British politics , " and suddenly she felt a really vicious contempt toward him . Those damned intricacies they always fell back upon . They talked the same way forty years ago . Only then you could afford intricacies as you could afford " brilliant failures " like Harry . You could n't afford them any longer . Something was loose in the world , somethingexasperated , something infuriated which would snuff all the Harrys and the " intricacies " out of existence . It was loose in Russia , in Germany , in England , in America , in India and the islands of the East . Even before the Major died , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a good time to sell wheat or cotton or railroad shares . That was why he put everything into nontaxable securities and left it all to her . But those damned English like Harry who thought their politics something special and precious which other people , even more civilized people like , the French could not understand ! There was all end in sight to " blundering through . " And for no reason at all , she wanted suddenly to cry , partlybecause she remembered the Major with sudden clearness as he had been in the beginning in the red and gold room at the Brevoort . Henry always made her think of him . And with thememory was the knowledge that out of all the women he hadown , he had loved her best of all . He had loved her and trustedher . It was there in every sentence of the long and intricate will ,  |p126Again  and again he had written in it , " to my beloved wife who will understand my purpose , " or " to my beloved wife who may be trusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cry too out of some cosmic sadness at the vanity and folly of the whole human race . And suddenly she wanted I Larry to go away and never return , because he had become , while he sat there arguing feebly with Henry , a symbol of all the years in her life which might have been rich but were , she saw now , only glittering and empty and wasted . Henry had done a much better job , farming and leading his warm , solid existence , with a dull healthy wife , wise and concupiscentand uxorious in the Parkington way . She thought : I must be getting old . . . dozing like this and wandering away into the past . And she was aware that Harry was rising , lifting his slim overbred elegance out of the depths of his chair . He looked beautiful but fragile . I will outlast him , she thought with the triumphant feeling of very old people , although . he is eight years younger than I. It was better to think of him as he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone to seed in futility . " In any case , " he was saying to Henry , " I am glad to hear the American point of view . " " It is not the American point of view , " said Henry , " It is my town . The American people do not understand what is happening in the world . They do n't think very far although they are great for feeling and have a remarkable instinct about things . " Then Harry did that remarkable thing which people of his station in life in his country had a way of doing . He turned away from Henry and came toward Mrs. Parkington and as he did so , he seemed to eliminate Uncle Henry from existence , as a child might wipe the chalk words from a slate . Henry did not seem to mind or even to notice for he was already talking to Janie . Mrs. Parkington thought : That is what they have been doing for too long . That is what they are still doing . Oh , the fools ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are today . She smiled at him but there was no feeling in the smile . It caused her pain . " I 'll go with you as far as the door , " she said and they wentp127out together , Mrs. Parkington feeling dry and withered and old . In the hallway , Harry said , " Your brother-in-law is quite a fellow . " " He is indeed . " " There is something about him that is very like Gus . " " Yes . . . a great deal . What are your plans ? " She asked them out of politeness although she had not the least interest . " I go to Washington . . . after that home , I suppose . " She did not say , " I must see you again , " or , " Let me know when you pass through . " She had not the least interest . This was very likely the last time they would ever see each other . " Well . Good luck on your trip . " Taylor had helped him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " It has been very nice seeing you , " said Harry , " You were always a wonderful woman . You still are . " " Thank you , Harry . Good-by again and good luck . " She stood at the top of the three low steps until the door closed behind him . Then slowly she went back again to the sitting-room , thinking how extraordinary it was that the past and the present and even the future were sometimes so intricately entangled , and she wished that she might not die but live on and on to see what was coming . Harry had not changed at all . He was the same Harry , older and more tired , she had known at Sandringham , in London , at Monte Carlo , at Oriander . It was herself who had changed . Harry , it seemed to her , was no more than a wraith out of a world which no longer existed . But once long ago he had clone her a great kindness in the case of Norah Ebbsworth . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already leaving . He kissed Janie again and then pressed his white beard against Mrs. Parkington'scheek and with the scent of cologne water and tobacco end horses , her spirits rose again . She said , " Henry , I am going to drive up and see you when the weather is better . " " It 's about time . You have n't been there since just after Gus died . "  | " I did n't realize it was so long . " He turned and smiled at Janie . " Why do n't you bring her too ? " he said to Mrs. Parkington . " She 's never seen her new cousin , Johnny . " " How old is he ? " asked Mrs. Parkington . " He 'll be four his next birthday . " Janie laughed , " I 've never been able to figure out his relationship  --  theson of my great-grandfather 's brother . " " Cousin , I suppose , " said Henry . " The Parkingtons are a remarkable family . " " I 'll come , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went away , and when he had gone , the smile still remained on Janie 's face . " I have n't seen him since I was a little girl . I never knew he was like that . Mama always said he was crazy . " " I 'm afraid your mother does n't understand I lenry 's quality , " said Mrs. Parkington , and she too smiled as if she shared a secret with Janie which none of the others knew . Then Taylor appeared to take away the tea tray . Ile said , " Mr. Stilham called , madame . He said he would be here about eight o'clock . " She looked at Janie slyly and then picked up the black Pekingeseand began rubbing its ears . She thought : The child does n't know anything . If it 's really serious who is to tell her ? And she knew that of course , the burden would fall upon her , because you could n't trust the others to make it as easy as possible for Janie . When Amory came in she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more high-colored than usual and she thought : It must be bad . He has been drinking . She had never known Amory to drink too much , save perhaps at college reunions and club dinners . There was , she knew , a sort of relief in such drinking for men like Amory who had never really grown up or learned anything . They drank because they wanted somehow to escape from a life which baffled and thwarted them back intop129the world of adolescence . She thought too : Amory is the kind of man who becomes a nasty drunk , and as if to prepare herself she stiffened her thin body a little and put down her coffee cup . " Good evening , Amory , " she said , " I 'm just finishing my coffee . Would you like some ? " " No , thanks , Granny . But I could do with a glass of brandy . " She pushed the bell beside her and flushed . Nothing irritated her so much as to have Amory call her Granny  --  a great , grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was drunk , it was particularly offensive . The thing was beginning all wrong . In its essence , she knew , the interview would be one of the most unpleasant she had ever known , but his drinking and surliness made it worse . Taylor appeared and she told him to take away the coffee and bring the brandy for Mr. Stilham . Then Mattie appeared and took away the Pekingese for their supper and Taylor returned with the brandy and poured a glass and served it to Amory . He said , " Thank you , Taylor . " He had not even said good evening to Mattie . To Taylor Mrs. Parkington said , " Do n't disturb us , Taylor .. If anyone calls , take the message . " " Yes , madame . " His face showed no sign of anything at all . As the door closed , she said , " Janie was here this afternoon and Uncle Henry . " " Crazy , as usual , I suppose , " said Amory . " Henry 's not very crazy , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out better than most of us . " She knew that Amory thought Henry vulgar and one of the many liabilities of the family . It was extraordinary how vulgar people were unable ever to understand what vulgarity was . It was like the uncanny ability of bores to recognize bores . " I have n't seen Janie since the Christmas party , " Amory said , " She 's never at home any more . She comes in about five in that morning and never gets up till afternoon . " " She looked very well and happy . " He did not answer but only finished his brandy and asked , " May I have another glass ? "  | " Yes , of course . " She wanted to say , " You are a grown man . You should know best if you should have another glass . " But she held her tongue . He stood up and went to the decanter and poured himself a second glass of brandy . Then he leaned against the yellow marblemantelpiece sliding his elbow along it to steady himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she could not prevent it . His elbow touched the shepherdess in Dresden china and gently , slowly in a kind of enchanted inevitable movement , pushed it over the edge . Mrs. Parkington gave a faint cry and started up out of her chair . The shepherdess struck the marble slab below and shattered , and she heard herself saying peevishly , " Oh , Amory ! I low could you ? " What she saw in the movement of the crash was not the death of the shepherdess but the death of the shepherd which had been her companion and was shattered long ago iii the house on ThirtyfourthStreet with the huge chandelier and the great hall with the oriental vases and the marble stairway . For the death of the shepherd had been a more violent death , although there was at least dignity in it . The shepherd had not been thrust to destruction by a drunken man but hurled all the way across the ballroom by a man who was very nearly insane with fury . She had cried out almost the same words to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " And had begun to cry . Aspasie Conti was in the room and I larriette Livingstone and Mrs. Morton Ogden and Gus had shouted , " I 'll be God-damned if I 'll take it lying down . I 'll make the bastards pay for it ! " In the eyes of Harriette , there was a look of shock and alarm , because it was probably that in all her life she had never before heard words like " God damn " or " bastard , " but in the eyes of Aspasie and Mrs. Morton Ogden there was a bright look , such as comes into the eyes of feminine women at the glorious sight : of anp131angry man whose fury is not directed at them . Aspasie was dressed in a chic but demure dress of black with a white fichu , which made her ugliness and handsome figure seem tall and tragic . She wore it because earlier in the evening she had been reciting a great scene from Phedre and the long speech of Celimene from Le Misanthrope for the guests . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous necklace of diamonds in New York and an aigrette in her hair . Harriette was in gray taffeta , dressed like a mouse . As the shepherdess fell from the : mantelpiece the whole scene returned to Mrs. Parkingtonin utter clarity , as if it were happening at that moment and not sixty years earlier . The shepherd and shepherdess had been a pair until Gus smashed the shepherd . They were pretty and delicate and expensiveand she had admired them in the window of Tiffany 's shop and a little later Aspasie had bought them and the Major had presented them to her on her birthday . And now Gus had hurled the poor shepherd across the room and shattered him beyond repair against the wall of the ballroom . She heard Mrs. Morton Ogden say , " You should n't have done that , Gus . The evening has already been bad enough for poor Susie . You should have considered her condition . " Then she felt Gus 's arms about her and his voice , the rage suddenlymelted out of it , saying , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy you ten shepherds tomorrow or fifty if you like , only do n't cry . It was n't you I was angry at . " " Vous etes brut " Aspasie said in the same angry voice Susie had heard once through the door of the red and gold room at the Brevoort . " Take her to bed , " said Mrs. Morton Ogden , and Gus still with his arm about her said , " Come along , sparrow , " and led her out of the ballroom past the dining-room where the men from Delmonico 's were putting into big wicker panniers all the rich food which had not been eaten by the guests who had not come . The sight made her feel sick with humiliation . At the foot of the stairs Gus picked her up and carried her past the palms and the lilies and red roses and garlands of smilax.  |p132Halfway  up the stairs , he stopped and kissed her throat and for a moment she forgot all about the party and what had happened . Then he said , " They 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! " " No , Gus . You must n't feel like that , " she whispered . " It does n't matter . It really does n't matter at all . I did n't cry because of that . I swear I did n't . . . It was because I 'm tired . " He did not answer her but carried her the rest of the way up the stairs and placed her on the great double bed of ebony inlaid with mother-of-pearl which he had bought at the Paris Exposition . Then he called in her maid . It was long before the day of Mattie and the maid was an Alsatian girl called Therese , a nice girl , sympathetic and very professional . He said to the maid , " Will you sec that Madame is put to bed at once and then go to the kitchen and bring her some hot milk . " 1 le kissed her again and said , " I must go downstairs now and say good night to Mrs. Ogden . I have one or two things to discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped her out of Madame de Thebes ' loops and garlands of pale yellow satin and white roses and she went into the next room to look at the children . She went itt so softly that she did not even waken the nurse who snored on while she stood looking down at them in their small cots . Alice was sleeping with one hand thrown across her face , her straight dark hair rolled in the Ingoudis which produced the sausagelike curls the nurse thought were fashionable . Herbert lay on his side , his face pressed into the pillow , his blond curls damp , his clear skin beautiful even in the dint light that came through the door of the bedroom . She stood longer at the side of Herbert , because he was beautiful and the sight of hint always brought a pang , half of satisfaction , half of fear . Alice was a nice child , docile and good , but she was sallow and dank without the radianceof her small brother . Susie admitted these things in the darkness , alone , secretly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she were a beauty . Now , looking down at them , she found herself praying  --  that they would have a decent , good life , that they would understand how to live and know the value of things that were good and simpleas she knew them , in spite even of Gus and all his flamboyancep133and generosity . She prayed out of a fear which she herself did not quite understand . What went on belowstairs she did not know until years afterwardwhen Mrs. Morton Ogden told her just before she died in the great marble house at Fifty-seventh Street . And even then , long afterward , she was able to reconstruct the scene , and because she knew the participants so well she was able to see it in her imagination and even divine what they had said and the part each played in the peculiar council of war . After they had dispatched Miss Livingstone to her invalid father in the Parkington brougham , the three of them  --  the Major and Mrs. Morton Ogden and Aspasie went into the small gold sitting room with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Dottie of iced champagne . The men from Delmonico 's had gone and the servants were sent to bed and all the lights were out save the gas flames inside the cut-glass globes of the great chandelier in the hall . Mrs. Morton Ogden sent home her own brougham which had been standing in the snow for an hour and awaited the return of the Parkington brougham from Miss Livingstone 's flat in Eighth Street . None of them had discussedthe business of shipping Harriette off ; they all knew that she was not a fit listener to what they meant to discuss . A mouse had no place at a conference of eagles . In the hearts of each of them sitting in the ornate little room there was fury . In the heart of Aspasie was the fury of a baffled performer . She had expected to perform before a large and fashionable audience , the cream of New York society , and on the gold chairs after dinner she found herself confronted by thirty or forty stockbrokers , speculators , Tammany politicians and their wives , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passages of Racine nor the wit of Moliere . She had gone on heroicallyreading in her deep passionate voice while her audience stirred and grew glassy-eyed on the gold chairs , bewildered by the spectacle of an ugly woman grimacing and making inexplicable and extraordinary sounds in a tongue of which not one of them understood anything . But she was enraged too because the bourgeoisie  --  she could not dignify their provinciality by the word mondaine  --  had insulted her darling Susie . Many of them had refused the invitations . That was understandable . But most of them had accepted , perhaps out of fear of the Major 's power and then failed to appear . The ones who had come were the " wrong people " but friends of the Major , some of them disreputable , whom he had insisted upon inviting . " They are my friends , " he said . " I see no reason why people should not mix . It is a civilized and intelligent thing for people of all sorts to know each other . " The only ones from St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came because they dared not refuse those who did not appear had insulted the " plus charmante femme du monde , ma there Susie ! " Opposite her in purple velvet and diamonds , tightly corseted and slightly red iii the face from champagne and the long pressureof her stays , Mrs. Morton Ogden enjoyed a special fury of her own . She rather liked what she called " having the furies " because otherwise life . in New York in the seventies became boringbeyond the point of endurance . And at heart , Mrs. Morton Ogden was a tyrant and a dictator . She was furious now because by the insult to Gus and Susie Parkington , she too had been insulted  --  or worse , she had been slapped in the face by scores of people whom in her heart she regarded with only faintly concealedcontempt . They had insulted Susie Parkington and Susie Parkington was her protegee , whom she had chosen partly because Susie was pretty and charming , but more because her husband was a challenge , one of the worst challenges . He was flamboyant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things which the women who dwelt behind the closed doors cherished most . He was a gambler and reckless and had a way with women , and disturbed many a respectable lady 's imagination in a way she had not believed possible until the moment he began talking to her . He was a buccaneer , a nobody who had made an immensep135fortune by none too scrupulous methods even in a day when scruples were of no great value . He was indeed a challenge , but Mrs. Morton Ogden 's perversity enjoyed challenges and she had made up her mind that she would " put over " the Parkingtons . It was not wise to cross Mrs. Morton Ogden if you wished to survive . She had immense power and she was perfectly aware of her power . It was compounded of many things . She had immense wealth come to her out of the original fortune of a grandfather who dealt in cattle and land , and of this wealth she had complete control , being a widow and childless . She managed it admirably and was not above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn everything into profits of one hundred to two hundred per cent and sometimes more . She had with Gus Parkington a perfect understanding . But she had more too than wealth ; she had an impeccable position with an ancestry on her grandmother 's side studded like plush with cairngorms with Livingstones and Van Rennselaers and Suydams and other members of heavy Dutch families which had come over to New Amsterdam to get on in the world . Her wit and her vigor , she knew well enough , had not come from them hut from her grandfather , the rich cattle drover . But they had their place in the scheme of things ; she did not undervalue those heavy names any more than she undervalued the millions and vigor that had come down from her grandfather . She had a great marble house far uptown on Fifty-seventh Street  --  within sight of the squatters and their goats and she had lived much abroad and when ambassadors and princes and dukes came to flatter the middle-class snobbery of her fellow citizens , they stayed with Mrs. Morton Ogden or were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Ogden had the courage of her own beliefs  --  that New York was dull and pro-f vincial and stuffy and that among those who constituted the bon ton there were no brains and very little cultivation . She would have preferred living in Paris or Rome but two things held her hack  --  one her greed for more and more money and the other a deep-dyed , deeply rooted patriotism which she concealed almostp136shyly . She had no patience either for the precious delicate souls who had fled the shopkeepers paradise of New York for Europe . She had an idea , indeed a kind of mission , that she could civilize New York and teach it how to use its money . She would say again and again , " By God , 1 ' 11 civilize them , if it 's the last thing I do ! " And so she forced many things down the throats of the already gorged , gouty and upholstered world of fashion ; among them her parties which were different from any other parties . Her food was the best food in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagonloads ; she did not have live or six courses of meat , game and fish , interrupted by Roman punch to provide the guests with . an opportunity to recover their breath . And after dinner the men were not permitted to stay for two hours swilling brandy and telling dirty stories or talking about the stock market . After dinner she frequently had singers from the French opera or recitations  --  Aspasie had read many times in her great marble house  --  and most horrible of all she invited the artists not only to sit at table with other guests but encouraged them to mingle as well . Only Mrs. Morton Ogden could achieve all these things . The others lacked the daring or the intelligence and sometimes both . She had taken up the Parkingtons as she had taken up the singers from the French opera , partly as a diversion from plush boredom , partly because of genuine fondness for Susie and admiration for Gus ( whom she looked upon as a kind of picturesque bandit whose friendship was immensely profitable ) and partly out of utter perversity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could not have found a more powerful friend . This , then , was Mrs. Morton Ogden , a free woman unhampered by conventions or complexes , who now sat with Aspasie and the Major in the gold room with the Italian pictures . While she listened to the conversation and occasionally put in a word , she was compiling a list of those who had defied her espousal of the Parkingtonsand who would never again pass the doors of her house . Among them were many people on the way up ( they were always the worst snobs ) to whom this privilege meant almost as much as life itself and some others who considered themselves the Oldp137Guard and strong enough to defy her . There were ways of humblingthem as well . If anyone knew how , it was Mrs. Malvina Ogden . She had not only prestige ; she had what in that world was a supreme power  --  she did not even know how rich she was . Aspasie was inclined to be a little hysterical . She cried out , " It is a conspiracy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ogden was not of that opinion . A few perhaps had conspiredbut most of them had simply done it deliberately thinking that on the next day they could say , " Did you go to the Parkingtonball ? We did n't . Impossible people ! One has to draw the line somewhere ! " But they would live to regret that . The Major said very little , but he too thought a great deal . He too was making lists of names which must not be forgotten . For very nearly the first time in his life , he was tired with a weariness born of the interminable , agonizing evening . There had been a curious kind of torturing humiliation about it as the hour grew later and later and only about half the guests who had accepted appeared , and slowly it became clear that it was , with one or two exceptions , the " wrong " half which came in . For a long time he had held on to the belief that they were late only because it was a snowy night , with icy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After the program of recitation and singing began , he gave up hope and sat near the back of the half-empty ballroom , miserably , on a stiff gold chair , carrying off the humiliationwith a frozen face , checking over and over again those who had come and resolving that he would never forget their loyalty  --  the politicians , the hangers on , the speculators . A dozen men in the room , without even knowing it , were started that night on their various ways to becoming rich men . Two or three , years later , were saved from jail because Augustus Parkington intervenedwith power and money . He was not a man to forget either a friend or an enemy . It was for Susie that he suffered most . For himself he was not sensitive . He had managed very well for himself and had no doubts about the future , but the humiliation for Susie was not to be borne . He suffered , never once understanding or believing that Susie did not care very much , that she would have preferredp138not giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not even like the big house . As the guests left , he said good-by to them with an air of cordialitybut the eyes were cold , like marble , and the lips drawn tight in a hard , brutal line . I t was only when the last guest had gone and there was only Susie , Aspasie and Harriette and Mrs. Ogden that his temper broke and he smashed the poor Dresden shepherd . But now in the room with the Italian pictures he was cold again , with the icy coldness which Susie never knew , but which terrifiedother people . When he turned cold Major Augustus Parkingtoncould be sadistic , criminal and ruthless . And when he turned cold he was silent with a fright citing silence . Aspasie was frightened and Mrs. Ogden was interested but unmoved because she was herself a little like Gus Parkingron and understood him , and because she always felt quite able to take care of herself . The butler , appeared presently and said the carriage had returned and Mrs. Ogden rose and left with Aspasic . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for the evening . I 'll expect you at tea tomorrow . . . without Susie . By God , I 'll civilize them or know the reason why . " When they had gone the Major wearily climbed the white marblestairs . He undressed in the darkness so as not to disturb Susie and all that night she slept with his arms about her , as if he would protect her thus forever . In the morning after he had gone away , she felt suddenly ill and Harriette sent for Dr. Westbrook , but by the time he arrived tt was too late to do anything . She lost her third baby and for a long time afterward was very ill . When she was well enough , the Major took a house for her in Long Branch and sent her and the children and nurse there for the summer . The house was not a big house ; it was much smaller than the Major would have liked but there was nothing else available . It was the kind of house Susie liked , rather worn andp139lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no necessity for going out to restaurants nor any for having people to dinner . There was in it no marble and no statuary and no palms , For the first time it seemed to her that she had a home . The Major came down on Friday and stayed until Tuesday and long afterward it seemed to her that in the ugly red house under the maple trees , they were happier than they had ever been before or afterward . It was not the wild happiness of those first passionate days at the Brevoort , but a warm , easy happiness in which they were used to each other , in which neither of them felt the need or desire for anyone else in the world . It was as if the Major 's impulse to protect and shelter her had become a passion . Sometimes during the week Aspasie came down to stay , for Aspasie was by now like one of the family . Usually she arrived on Tuesday after the Major had left and returned to the city on Friday before he had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French because Susie wanted to speak the language perfectly and because by now , it was very nearly as natural for her to speak French as to speak English . She began to read French books and poetry and plays . When the weather was fine they took the children with them and picnicked on the beach beneath a great parasol . Harriette did not come down at all since she could not leave her poor father and there was really no need for her , since there were no engagements , no meetings , no housekeeping which could cause any worry . Her father knew now about her connection with Major Parkington and he had become reconciled almost with pleasure to the shocking connection because it meant that he lived now almost in luxury in a new flat and no longer had to write once a month to three or four rich relatives to remind them that their contributions to his upkeep were overdue . Major Parkingtontook care of everything , lavishly . It was extraordinary ; Harriette 's father discovered how useful money could be . The absences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He never again spoke of the ball to which people had not come and Susie was thankful for that . It was an ugly thing , pI40 and she saw no reason to embrace ugly things unless one was forced to face them . Nor did Aspasie ever speak of it . All that summer it was as if the ugly thing had never happened . The summer itself passed lazily with the Major spending the evenings at home and sometimes going out late at night after she was asleep to go to the gambling casino . The city seemed far away , like something Susie had dreamed , and presently as the summer wore on , she came to begrudge the passing not only of each day but each hour . At last she ceased even reading the newspapers , although Aspasie with her French mind could not pass a day without reading her ' journal from cover to cover . But Aspasie did not trouble to read or repeat : Inv but the most sensational of the paragraphs she encountered . That was how Susie came to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a great headline in two inch type across the whole front of the paper , because Radnor Beaumont was a rich man and an important man in New York , not only in finance but in the fashionable and sporting world as well . Susie and Aspasie had been sitting under the parasol while the nurse and children walked along the edge of the surf collecting shells , and when Aspasic took the newspaper out of her bag and opened it and read the headline , the name Radnor Beaumont meant not very much to Susie , little more at first than simply the dim image of a big heavy man with gray hair and a pompous manner and a tall thin wife whom she had met at one of Mrs. Morton Ogden 's soirees . She remembered them as being a disagreeablecouple to whom the Major had presented her with pride . They had not seemed impressed and had turned away after talking for a little time about nothing at all . She went on sewing , her mind filled with images of the Beaumonts , while Aspasie went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suicide was une affaire passionelle and when she discovered that it had only to do with money , the interest went out of her voice . The account of the tragedy was not an inspiring story Radnor Beaumont had inherited a large part of his wealth and influence , and so like most conservatives , not being at all certain that he could replace it once it was lost , he had been a carefulp141man . The news that he had plunged and that he was a ruined man and a bankrupt was probably more shocking to his friends than the actual fact of his suicide . He had hung himself to a hook in the wardrobe of his own dressing-room in the house on Fifth Avenue and no one had found the body until many hours after the act . ( In these details Aspasie 's voice betrayed her interest . ) There was a note which stated simply that he was ruined , and could not possibly hope to meet his debts . When she had finished reading , Aspasie folded the newspaper and lay it across her knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not speak for a long time Susie looked up from her sewingat the strong fierce profile and in a sudden swift wave of intuition , she thought : Aspasie is thinking that Radnor Beaumont was one of those who accepted for dinner and the ball and then did not appear . For the profile of Aspasie against the blue of the Atlantic was set and hard with no pity in it . But neither of them spoke of the ball . Presently Aspasie said , " I did not like him . He was a vulgar , provincial man who put on airs . " Two days later a letter came from Mrs. Morton Ogden . She was at Newport , she wrote , and the weather was very had with much fog . She hoped that Susie had recovered and was feeling herself again . If she felt strong enough it might be a good idea to leave the children and come to Newport for a short visit . She was certain Gus would not object ; in fact she had discussed it with Gus when they had met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she added , Susie had heard of Radnor Beaumont 's ruin and suicide . I do not think she wrote , that he will be greatly missed . He no longer really had any place in the financial life of New York . The city is no longer a small town closed corporation , belonging to a few people whose money grew out of real estate . He was behind the times  --  a small frog in what is becoming a big puddle . One day New York will be the banking center of the world . I understand his wife has collapsed completely and after the funeral will go away for a " rest cure . " Susie did not go to Newport . She wanted simply to stay onp142and on forever at Long Branch . She answered that while she could think of nothing more enjoyable than a visit with Mrs. Ogden , the doctor advised against it . She did not like the idea of the friendship between Gus and Mrs. Ogden , nor the fact that they had been seeing each other during the summer . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Susie was not by nature a jealous woman and it would certainly have been preposterous to suppose that the Major , with his liking for young pretty women , could find anythingphysical to admire in a war horse like Malvina Ogden . The jealousy was of another kind -- because she divined that Gus talked to Mrs. Ogden about such things as politics and railroads and mines and banks , and never mentioned them to his own wife , treating her as if she were too frivolous or too stupid to understand . And her instinct told her that they were had for each other because they were too much alike  --  energetic , ruthless , willful and contemptuous of others . The ambitions of both were insatiable . Gus was bad enough on his own , without being stimulated by someone like Mrs. Ogden . That was one of her small worries . She had another too about little Alice . She was a good child who never cried or soiled her frocks , who , even at three , had good manners . It was as if , already , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow make up for it by being gentle and agreeable . When people passed the children on the boardwalk or the beach they always overlooked Alice and spoke to her brother , sitting up , golden haired and blue-eyed in his end of the pram . They would say that he was an angel and charming and beautiful and touch his curls . And if they noticed Alice at all it was to say , " She is a nice child too . How do you do , little girl ? " And Alice would answer politely , " Very well , thank you . " The awful thing was that Susie herself , in her heart , deep inside her , felt like the people on the beach . At sight of little Herbert her own heart leapt with delight ; at sight of Alice she felt nothing at all with her heart . Her head told her : You must be doubly nice to Alice to make up for the difference . Sometimes , almost in anguish , she thought : Oh , why could n't Alice had have Her/bert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks like . A boy can take care of himself . Alice was so dull and good and little Herbert even at two was high-spirited and willful and naughty . Sometimesshe wondered where Alice had come from , for she seemed to have in her looks and manner nothing of either herself or the Major . Even her looks would not have mattered so much if she had not been so listless and dull . Aspasie was an ugly woman but after a few moments of conversation with her one forgot her looks entirely and thought of her as handsome . She was thinking of all these things one morning for the thousandthtime as she watched the two children playing with their buckets and shovels in the sand , when Aspasie began again readingaloud from her newspaper . There had been , it seemed , a whole epidemic of failures in New York . Radnor Beaumont was the first and three other solid firms had followed in quick succession . The partners of one of them , James Bradish and Alister Alsop , had been arrested . More arrests , predicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had finished reading , Aspasie folded her paper carefully in her thrifty French way and looked out to sea , and again Susie remembered that James Bradish and Alister Alsop and their wives were among those who had accepted but had not come to the ball . Of this neither Aspasie nor herself said anything . Again when she looked at Aspasie the Frenchwoman was looking out toward the sea , her profile fierce as an eagle . The ' . for the first time a strange suspicion came to Susie , a suspicion so fantastic as to be scarcely believable . She looked again at Aspasie and said suddenly , " What are you thinking , Aspasie ? " The Frenchwoman sighed and withoutturning toward her she said , " I 'm thinking what a remarkable man your husband is . He should have been a general like Bona-parte . " When they arrived home from the hot beach , there was a telegramfrom New York on the table in the hall . Telegrams were not common in those days and the sight of it alarmed Susie . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As she tore it open she thought of Gus . Nothing must happen to Gus !  |p144But  it did not concern Gus . It was from Harriette Livingstone . It read , " Am arriving by afternoon train . Hope it will not inconvenience you but need is urgent . Lovingly , Harriette . " How could Harriette leave her father ? How could Harriette who never traveled at all conic all the way to Long Branchalone ? Susie and Aspasie drove to the little pitch-roofed , shingled , red station and brought her hack to the house through the hot afternoon sun . Harriette vas tremulous and full of apology. . j know Aspasic will forgive Inc if I do n't say why I have come . I would not have troubled you but it was so important . It is something very secret . " She laid a gray-gloved hand on the hand of Aspasic and said , " You will forgive Inc , wo n't you ? I know you will understand . Sonic day I 'll he able to tell you . " of course , " said Aspasic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aspasie like a cancer and she thought : Probably it 's nothing at all . . . Harriette 's sense of proportion is so grotesque . Very likely it is nothing at all . She kept telling herself this because she was really troubled lest what Harriette had to tell her concerned ( . us . She did not deceive herself ; she had known for a long time that sooner or later someone would come to her and say , " Have you heard that your husband is keeping an actress ? " Gus , she knew well enough , was like that . A wife was n't enough for Gus . There was too much of him , too much vitality , too much gusto , too much of an appetite for parties and gaiety and low life . He had to have a lot of things a wife could not give him , things indeed which he would not permit a wife to give him because if she was like that he would no longer want her as his wife . For a long time she had known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had worked to prepare herself for the discovery , yet now as she drove back to the little house with Harriette and Aspasie , she knew that when the time came it would be no easier for her than if the news had come to her , unprepared , out of the blue . The horses stopped beneath the big maples and the three of then got down.  | " ' What a pretty house ! " said Harriette , " And such a pretty lawn and trees ! It 's what the French would call tres coquette ! " " It is nice , " said Susie , thinking that at times Harriette 's gentlenessand simplicity approached the borders of half-wittedness . There were times when she doubted that Harriette minded very much having been jilted , or being an old maid , or having to take care of her father . Sometimes she thought it was useless to waste pity on someone who had no profound feelings of any kind . She remembered something Gus had once said  --  that to be capable of tragedy , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , she led Harriette to her own bedroom , to " freshen up " but Harriette could not even wait for that . The moment the door was closed she stood with her back against it and said , " It is a great favor I have to ask from you . " Susie felt suddenly weak with relief and sat down on the big lied ; it was n't then what she thought , it was n't that Gus was unfaithful . She was aware that Harriette was experiencing a kind of perverse enjoyment in the excitement of the moment . Harriettewas blossoming since she had come to know spectacular people . She was no longer the old pathetic , persecuted Harriette . Susie said , " What is it , Harriette ? " " It 's about my cousin , Goodhue Blair . " She moved away from the door and sat on the bed beside Susie . " He came to the flat last night . He was a little intoxicated and said that if I could not help him there was only one thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very respectable man . I never saw him like that before . He said that he knew I was a friend of yours .. . I hope he was not exaggerating . " Susie made a deprecating gesture but did not interrupt Harriette . She continued , " He said that whether or not he killed himself was a matter entirely in the hands of Major Parkington . " " How could that possibly be ? " asked Susie . " I 'm afraid I do n't understand myself , " said Harriette , " Pm not very good about things which have to do with money , but it seems that Goodhue 's firm is in great difficulty and that the Major could save it and Goodhue . It is a very good firm , very old and well-established . When he asked me to come to you , I could not well refuse . I hope you do n't think I am presuming . " Susie laid her hand on Harriette 's gray-gloved one , " Of course not . You have been very kind to me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major . " " I have never seen my cousin Goodhue in such a state before . He said he had appealed to Major Parkington himself but that he had refused to help him . Goodhue is a very proud man . I think he must have drunk too much in order to get up his courage . There is not much time , he said . Only until tomorrow evening at the latest . " Harriette had neither the tact nor the intelligence of Aspasie and now she plunged full into the tire , " I know Goodhue and his wife did not attic to the party , hut I think he meant to come . He said that Esther  --  that 's his wife  --  was ill in bed with kidney complaint . She 's never been quite right since her last child was born . I think he was telling the truth . " Susie felt the color rising in her cheeks and said quickly , " I 'm sure that all this has nothing to do with whether they came to the party or not , Harriette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain it as best I can to hint . I 'm sure he 'll know more about it than either of us do . " " You 're very good to me , " said I larriette , " You 've always been so good to Inc . You are really an angel , Susie . " " Never mind that . Will you be spending the night ? " " No , that I could n't do . Father will be expecting me . There is a train tonight , is n't there ? They told me there was . " " There 's a train at six-ten . Aspasie is going back on it . If you 'd like to stay , I 'm sure we 'd be delighted to have you . " " No . I 'll go back with Aspasic . " Suddenly she began to cry . " I love you and the Major so much , " she said , " Your kindness has made all the difference to Father and me . " " It 's nothing , " said Susie , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Harriette period " was coming to an end . Gus would arrange for her and her father , but gradually , in a kindly way , Harriette would have to go out of the picture . She was not only becoming tiresome but silly as well . The dreary Harriette had been much preferable to this senti/mental one . Thank God there was no sentimentality in Aspasie . Susie rose from the bed and said , " There is just time for you to have tea and a sandwich before the train leaves . Come along . " She held the door open for Harriette and followed her as she went out . Already she had forgotten Harriette 's tiresomeness because she knew now that her suspicion was true . Gus had deliberately set about ruining the people who had humiliated them . He had been responsible for Radnor Beaumont 's suicide and the arrest of James Bradish and Alister Alsop . And now there was Goodhue Blair and many others . And in the backgroundwas Mrs. Ogden ... She saw it all clearly now . Between them they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violently ill . After Aspasie and Harriett had gone to the train she went to her own room and lay on the bed preparing herself for what she should say when the Major arrived on the evening train . At first as she listened to Harriette 's fluttering muddled appeal , she had experienced only a swift sense of relief that what Harriette had come to tell her was not what she dreaded ; but now the feeling of relief was gone and there remained only the knowledge of what Gus had done  --  that he was responsible for Radnor Beaumont'sdeath and the ruin of a dozen other men because they had dared to humiliate him . The fact itself had very little reality for her ; what shocked her was the knowledge that her husband whom she loved could be so vindictive , so bitter , so ruthless . For a little time she tried to persuade herself that Harriette , being so addlepated , had got the whole story muddled , but she could not quite accomplish this because she remembered the look in the Major 's eye as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Gus she had never seen before although people had told her he could be like that . And she remembered the cold glint in Mrs. Ogden 's eyes . These were powerful , ruthless people who struck with violence and calculation . She had her own fashion of getting what she wanted ; sometimes she achieved it even against the force of people like the Major and Mrs. Ogden . There were soft ways of wearing people down , of tricking them into doing what you wanted . She was herself no innocent and cooing dove . But the other two could be terrifying . She heard her carriage conic in the drive and heard the Major descend and climb the steps and open the door , and still she thought : He can not be like that ! Harriette must be crazy ! Always she was glad when he returned and was at the door to be kissed by him , but tonight she could not bring herself to meet him because she herself experienced a curious feeling of shame , as if she had unwittingly been involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feel more acutely than ever that there was a part of the Major she did not know at all and had never known , all that part which had to do with his mines and banks and railroads . That part of him he had always kept hidden , thrusting hey aside when she sought to penetrate the mystery and understand him , all of him . She felt now that when she saw him , there would be in her feelings as in her manner , a strangeness , almost a hostility , which had never been there before . Then she heard his voice calling , " Susie ! Susie ! Where are you ? " and she opened the door and went to the stair rail and said , weakly , " Here I am , Gus . Could you come up here ? " He came up the stairs three steps at a time but when he saw her , something in her face chilled him and he stopped in the doorway and said , like a small boy , " What is it , sparrow ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet me ? " She sat down on the bed , confused and unhappy . At sight of him , the old rush of love swept over her and when it had passed , she thought : He is the one who did that . He was mean and spitefuland small and vengeful . But she managed to say , " Something happened . I meant to be at the door but I could n't . " " What happened ? " " Harriette was here . She stayed only an hour or two . She told me about Goodhue Blair . . . and all the others . " He did not answer her at once . He took a chair from againstp149the wall and placed it beside the bed . Then he sat down and looked at her , distantly , with a coldness she had never before encountered in him . And she thought : This is how he is outside , with other people . That is why they are afraid of him , for she herself was suddenly frightened . " So Harriette has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did n't come for that . She came to ask me to ask you a favor . . . not to ruin her cousin . She said it was entirely in your hands and that her cousin would kill himself like Radnor Beaumont if you did n't help him . " " Goodhue Blair wo n't kill himself . He has n't the guts . The worst he could do would be to drink himself to death . " The contempt in his voice was like ice . He moved a little nearer and after a moment said , " Do you know what you are talking about , Susie ? " " No . Only what I 've been told and what I guessed . You never let me know anything . I 'm not a fool , you know , Gus . I 've plenty of brains . My brains might even be useful to you . That 's the only thing I 've ever resented ... that you treated me alwayse a fool in these things . " " Business has nothing to do with women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " " Malvina Ogden is not a woman . She 's much smarter than most men . Tell me , what is it that you guessed ? " She looked away from him , filled again with a curious sense of shame , for him . She said , " That you ruined a score of men and their families because they did n't come to a ball we gave . , and you caused one man at least to kill himself . " Slowly she forced herself to look at him . Ills head was bent . Ile was looking at the heavy gold watch chain which he wore across his waistcoat , turning it round and round with his long strong fingers . " Yes , " he said , " That 's true . People ca n't do a thing like that w my wife . I might have had another son but for them . " " No , " she said quickly , " That 's not true . I had a fall . That was what caused it . " But she knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he died.  | " But that 's not all the story , " he was saying , without looking at her , " There 's much more to it , much more than you will ever understand . It 's not woman 's business but I 'll try to explain it to you . Those same men would have ruined me just as ruthlessly . They were trying to do it , but they were n't strong enough . They were n't clever enough , not all of them together . I can tell you one thing  --  that if they had succeeded I would n't have hung myself in a cupboard . I 'd have gone back to work and made another fortune and got t hem in the end . They were n't only my enemies , they were the enemies as well of the whole country . " She could not imagine what he meant but she was aware of a change in his manner . The anger was gone ; he was calm and serious . Even the duality of his voice had changed . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhetorically , " It 's the biggest thing there has ever been on this earth . It 's got everything . Did you ever think about the coal , the oil , the mines , the good fertile soil , the forests ? We have n't even scratched the surface yet . There are n't ten people in this country who understand what is ahead of us , what this nation can become . I 'm one of the ten people , Susie . It 's so big that I ca n't even believe it myself . It needs big men to go ahead and build it up  --  not men like Radnor Beaumont and Goodhue Blair . They 're New Yorkers and small-town men . Why , they 've never even seen this country . What can men like that know about a place like Leaping Rock ? What can they know about the West when they stick around New York and worry about whose parties they should go to or not go to . Do you know where they made their money ? They inherited most of it and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fathers and grandfathers to make it . They just sat and watched their land turn into money because other people developed factories and business and made it valuable for them . All they had to do was hang on to what they had . Always remember one thing , Susie , that the people who inherit money are always the tightest with it . They 're afraid that if they lost it they 'd never be able to make it again . That 's why Radnor Beaumont hung himself  --  because he knew in his heart that onceMRS . PARK INGTON 151p151he was ruined he was ruined for good . There was n't any coming back . " As if to help him make clear what he was trying to tell her , he stood up and began walking up and down . " Those men were trying to run the country  --  this great God-damned wonderful country they do n't know anything about . They were trying to make it into a closed corporation for themselves  --  the country they did n't know anything about at all . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pygmies  --  that 's what they are  --  pygmies . They did their best to ruin us . They thought we were nobodies , upstarts . They thought because they had hung on to what was given them , that they were smart with their twopennytight little minds . " He whirled about suddenly , " They 'd have ruined the country ! They 'd have let it stagnate ! All they wanted was to keep it for themselves . They wanted to stop all progress , to keep it the small tight world they 'd always known . " He came over and stood at the foot of the bed , " They had to go just as all little people all through history have to go . There 's a new world coming , a world so big most people ca n't even understand it and it needs a new kind of men who can take chances and think big ... big as the great valley at Leaping Rock . This tight little world is busting open . There 's a new sort of men who are big enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . Gould and Harriman and Vanderbilt and a lot of others and myself . In another twenty-five years all the Goodhue Blairs and Radnor Beaumonts will be living in houses on back streets if they wo n't learn . " He bent over the end of the bed and took her hand , " Listen , sparrow . Did you ever know what I think about this country ? I would n't trade Texas for the whole of Europe . Texas you can do something with . You can build into the future . Europe is stuck in a groove . It 's all developed and finished . No , these little fellows tried to drive us out , to smash us . They tried to block us every way they could . They 're not going to count much longer . If you 're to get ahead as a banker you 've got to be big and think big from now on . Nobody 'll ever miss ' em . They hadp152to go . The rest of us have a job to do . A big job that takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a three per cent sure thing . " She was dazzled by his eloquence and the look of fire in his blue eyes . She had never thought of him like this . Even all his gusto and pleasure in life had seemed to her no more than a natural phenomenon , without direction . Now she began to understand many things . " It happened to work two ways , " he said , " It killed two birds with one stone . . . because it killed off a lot of birds who were rude to you . " Ile took her hand between his two big hands and said , " You see ? I 'm sorry you thought me so small that I 'd do something like that just out of revenge . " " I did n't think that . . . really . I did n't know . " " We 're set now . The world belongs to us . " He came round the end of the bed and sat down beside her . " I 'll take care of Goodhue Blair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to Harriette . IT leave hint with enough to live on but not enough to ever again be dangerous . " " Thank you , Gus . I 'll telegraph to Harriette . " And then out of her immense curiosity , she asked , " And Mrs. Ogden ? " " What do you mean  --  Mrs. Ogden ? " " Was she in on it ? " " Yes . She 's one of the ones who understands how big this country is . " He grinned . " And you remember she always said , I 'll civilize ' em or know the reason why ! ' Do you understand and will you forgive me ? " " Yes , Gus . " Then he kissed her and she forgot all her anxieties for the moment . " It was n't so bad losing the baby , Gus , " she said , " I 'm going to have another . " It was all right now , save for one little sadness . She knew now that the little red house was no more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of home she wanted . A home did n't fit in with what Gus had been talking about as he paced up and down her bedroom , illuminated by the passion and excitementof his ambitions , of his vast and curious dreams.  |p153In  the moment she stood there watching Amory , red-faced and clumsy , trying to pick up the pieces of the shattered shepherdess , it had all come back to her  --  the painful memory of the ball and the figures of Aspasie and Harriette , Mrs. Ogden and the Major . Of late the past returned to her in sudden unexpected flashes of memory , very clear and compressed , as if in a capsule containing only the essence and the significance of what had happened . And things which had occurred long ago began to fall into place in the pattern of her long existence , so that she understood how each apparently isolated episode had grown out of the past and in turn had its influence upon the future  --  that future which for a long time now had become the past . Time she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explored deeply enough to fathom its meaning and operation in relation to man . She thought suddenly of the simple description of relativity which her friend Dr. Salveminni had given her  --  that if you went along a river in a boat the landscape unfolded bit by bit in successionbut that if you saw the same landscape from an airplane , you saw it all at once . She was beginning now to see her whole life as a whole , as if she saw it all at once from an airplane , rather than strung out , incident by incident , like the pearls of a necklace . She did not doubt the toughness and agility of her mind . In some ways it was brighter and quicker than it had ever been , alive with intuition and a kind of clairvoyance , darting this way and that like a firefly , and in a way it was stronger than it had ever been because it had wisdom for a base . But relativity , philosophy , were not the concern of the moment . It was Amory , stooping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he struggled to pick up the shattered fragments of the shepherdess . She said , " Let it go , Amory , Taylor will clear it away later . You may fall into the fireplace and burn yourself . " Relieved , Amory stood erect and said , " I 'm very sorry , Granny . I do n't know how it happened . "  |p154The  word " Granny " infuriated her again but she still held her peace . She thought : If he is to make any sense , he must have a moderately clear head and aloud she said , " I think some coffee would help you , " and relighted the flame under the silver coffee urn . He went over to a chair and sat for a time with his elbows on his knees , his head in his hands . When the coffee was hot , she poured a cup and carried it over to him . " It will be better withoutcream and sugar , " she said . Then he looked up at her suddenly as if he saw her for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that this was why he had been drinking . The look in his eyes softened her and brought a quick , sudden understanding . She thought : It is really not his fault . I he was born above his station . He is a dull fellow , not very bright , and he was taught all sorts of false things in school and at home , among them that . any Stilham was a superior and privileged creature , that the world somehow depended on what he and his friends did and thought . Things were expected of him that were far beyond his capabilities . They tried to make a silk purse out of a sow 's ear . And he himself had believed it all until now . . . now when he had at last overstrained in his effort to convince himself that he is what he is supposed to be . He drank the coffee and she said , gently , as if to help him back to clarity , " You wanted to talk to me , Amory . What was i about ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " You told me you would consider loaning it if I told you all the circumstances . " " Yes . That 's right . " He said nothing more for a moment but sat staring into space as if making a gargantuan effort to regain possession of himself . " More coffee ? " she asked . " Yes , please . " He came over to her and she refilled the cup . When he sat down again he said , without looking at her , " You never liked me much , did you ? " He was saying things now that it would never have occurred to him to say if he were completelysober.  | " No , Amory . Although it was n't exactly dislike . I thought you were the wrong person for Helen and wrong in our family and I did not think you and Helen loved each other enough to make up for all that . " " Maybe you were right . Sometimes I think you were . " " Let 's not bother with that , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He sighed and she knew what was behind the sigh  --  a desire to go back and begin over again , to go back to his early youth when , like Harry , he had lived in an enchanted world which seemed to have been constructed only for his pleasure and success . There were so many American men like that , huddling together in their clubs like refugees , going back to class reunions and club dinners to recapture what could not be recaptured save in the hazy illusion of alcohol . " What do you want this money for ? " she asked , and bluntly he said , " To pay back what I have stolen . " " It 's as bad as that ? " " Yes . " Wonderingly , she asked , " Why did you do it ? You had plenty of money . You knew there was more , much more , in the background . You had only to wait until I died . I had already given lelen a great deal . " " All that has n't much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make more money . I wanted to be successful . " " There are so many things you could have done , so many things in this world to be interested in . " And into her mind came n childish jingle she remembered out of nowhere : The world is so full of a number of things , I 'm sure we should all be as happy as kings . But Amory was unaware of all that . All his expensive education had n't taught him anything , least of all how to live the short span of time allotted to man . At fifty he had a child 's mind without a child 's curiosity or enthusiasm . Somewhere , sometime , something had gone wrong . There were too many men like him in America , so many that there must be some deep-rooted colossal fault in the very foundations of the whole structure . " What I did was n't really wrong , " Amory was saying , " I used clients ' securities as collateral on loans . It 's been done many times before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If things had gone as I expected there would n't have been any trouble . I 'd have replaced it all . But the government began to meddle and pry into the books . After all , we are a reputable firm . It was n't as if it was done by a nobody . They might have left me alone . We have n't any rights left , even in our private lives . " She did not answer him at . once . She was trying to see his point of view  --  that what he had done was all right since it was done by Amory Stilham . It was a curious point of view and he , she knew , was not the only one who shared it . They all had been brought up to believe things like that . The Major had , in his lifetime , been guilty of all sorts of skullduggery , things as bad as this and worse , but he had been clever enough to get away with them and he had never pretended that he deserved special privileges or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only rule was the frank one , that the end justified the means ; if you got away with it , everything was all right . Amory was stupid . " It 's the interference of the government which has ruined everything , " he was saying . " It 's killed all our business . It 's made it impossible to operate . " It was a curious point of view , leading nowhere but backward . She saw , quite clearly , that he did not feel himself guilty of wrongdoing because he was Amory Stilham and a broker and that as such he should suffer no interference . There was no use going on with it . She asked , " How much did you tell me you 'd need ? " " About seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars . " She caught her breath , " That , Amory , is a great deal of money . If I gave it to you , it would have to come out of Helen 's share . Does she agree to that ? " He moved uneasily in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows nothing about it . " " There is another thing , " she said , " If I gave it to you to pay back your clients , would it stop the whole thing ? " " I do n't know . " " That is something you had better find out . "  |p157He  did not answer her . " How soon , " she asked , " Would this have to be done ? " " Now . . . as soon as possible . It 's about to come before the Grand Jury . " " Why did n't you tell me sooner ? Now it may be too late . " " I hoped to get money from partners and friends and hush the whole thing up . " " And they did n't give it to you ? " " No . A lot of them did n't have it . . . with taxes and restrictionsand all this New Deal rot . " " And if the thing ca n't be stopped ? " " I shall have to stand trial . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " He looked away from her without finishing the sentence and she felt a sudden chill come over her whole body . " Prison " was what he had not said . She had felt the chill , the same sort of awful dead , cold , chill years ago when a reform campaign and the law had very nearly caught up with Gus and they had had to live out of New York State for a whole year while he bribed himself out of the hole . It was only a little while after Eddie was born . That was how he had come to be born in Wilmington instead of New York City , because the shadow of prison hung over his father . Bribery ! That was how Gus had done it . He had bought his way out . Perhaps it could be done again now , half a century later , in the case of Amory . She was not afraid for herself , she was beyond being touched by scandal , nor was she afraid for Amory . What happened to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake of Janie and her young man . She said , " I will have to talk to Judge Everett before I can do anything . Does he know anything about it ? " " I do n't know . " " He mentioned the possibility of some kind of trouble to Alice . " The color came into Amory 's face . The mutual hatred of the Duchess and Amory was of long standing in the family , " Why did he tell her of all people . "  | " I do n't know . " " When can I have an answer ? It must be quick or it will be coo late to do any good . Once it 's in the papers they 'll all be after me just because I 'm Amory Stilham and in Wall Street . " Very calmly she said , " That has nothing to do with it , Amory . It 's exactly as if you were a little bank clerk who stole money out of the till to gamble with at the races . " He looked at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , " he said , " I 'm a respectable and prominent businessman with a good deal of background and connections . " Quite suddenly he was sober again . Still there was no use in trying to make him understand what she meant . " Are you going to tell Helen and the children ? " " If it can be settled , there will be no need to tell anyone . " Bitterness corroded his voice . " Sometimes lately I think that what happened to me would n't matter much to the children . They 're like strangers to me . " She did not deny this . She only said , " If I can arrange this I want only one promise . . . that I 'm to be allowed to tell Janie . " " It would make it easier for me . " She was suddenly weary of him and said , " I think the best thing for you would be to go home and get some sleep . " " I do n't sleep . " " And Helen ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't slept for months . " He rose and said , " Could I have another glass of brandy ? It 's the only thing that keeps me going . " " Of course , but I would n't depend on it . " As he poured the glass she added , " The Major always had a remarkable rule . When things were going well he could and did drink many a man under the table . When things went badly , he never drank anything at all . " Amory drained the glass and said , " The Major was a remarkable man . I could never hope to emulate him . " He said it simply without sarcasm and with a touch of admiration . She looked at him sharply , " The Major was a remarkable man , " she said , " But in many ways not an admirable one . I shouldp159advise anyone against emulating his morals in these days . The ) world spend most of their lives in jail . " He looked at her in astonishment , a little shocked by her honesty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was devoted only to a part of him . I felt only contempt for the rest . I have , I think , never said that before . 1 wanted you to know . He caused much unhappiness and tragedy through his ambition . That is unforgivable in anyone . I have lived a long time , Amory . That is the unforgivable crime . It is something to contemplate . " But she was getting beyond his depth and she drew back . " If you do n't mind , I 'll go to bed . I 'll need a lot of strength for tomorrow . " He flushed , " Of course . I 'm sorry . But before I go there 's one thing I 'd like to say . " She waited without speaking and he went on . " It 's about Janie . I wish you could persuade Janie to stop seeing this young man she 's lost her head over . You 're the only one who has any influence with her . " " What 's wrong with him ? He seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't anything to offer her . " Again she did n't answer him and he said , " Besides it 's very embarrassing for me . He was the one who uncovered the trouble . " " But I thought she met him in your house , Amory . " " That 's true . He did come out for a weekend . " " Why ? " The bluntness of the question startled him . Again the color swept the big , handsome , empty face . " I wanted to sec whether there was some way of inducing him to call the thing off before he found out too much . " " Was there ? " she asked bluntly . " No . He 's a damned fanatic , a Red , filled with crackpot ideas . " She smiled and moved toward the bell to summon Taylor . Amory followed her and a moment before Taylor appeared he said , " You have been very good and understanding . Thank you . " " I 'll do all I can , Amory. " -I hen Taylor came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Taylor noticed at once the shattered fragments of the shepherdess , and she said , " Mr. Stilham accidentally knocked the piece of Dresden off the mantel . " " Shall I save the pieces and have it mended , madame ? " " No . It 's not worth it . Throw them out . " She knew suddenly that she was glad to be rid of the shepherdess . There had been something ill-omened about the Dresden pair . Each had been shattered at a moment of great unhappiness , almost of disaster . Taylor said , " Judge Everett called , madame . He said he would call again in the morning . " " Thank you , Taylor and good night . " She went out thinking : If he called , it must he bad enough for him to offer to help . In any case he knows . It will save me the trouble of having to explain . She did not go to sleep at once . After Mattie had gone away , she tried to read but the great , red , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages , so that the words on them meant nothing . She kept thinking too of other things -- all the nonsense Amory had been taught and believed , all the folly and shabbiness of the world out of which he had come . It seemed to her , thinking of the war and what was going on in Europe as she lay there quietly in her bed , that the folly of the human race was beyond comprehension , that it was bent upon destroying itself through stupidity as the great dinosaurs and Brontosaurus had done . The human race seemed to have developed very little common sense and virtually no sense of values at all . She could not , honestly , exempt herself since again and again in her lifetimeshe had yielded to the common vanities and stupidity . Perhaps , she thought , addressing herself , you did acquire wisdom only through experience and by the time you had acquired wisdom you were too old to put it to any good use . It was a poor thing to belong to the human race ; being a dog like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog had ap161better time in life than many people in Europe were having at the moment . Presently she put aside the book altogether and turned out the light , but still sleep did not come . The darkness seemed to make it worse ; her mind went round and round like a carrousel , always in movement , always returning to the same place  --  this ugly business of Amory . She thought bitterly that it was pretentious of him to believe that he could be a crook and get away with it ; he was n't clever enough . The Major had certainly done many shady things but they were conceived on a grand scale involving millions , and somehow , curiously enough , people and even the nation itself had drawn great wealth and benefits from his operations . There seemed to be no men like him any longer ; there had n't been for a long time . And it was not true  --  what Amory whined  --  that they no longer had the opportunity . The opportunitywas still there , in a different way , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought how pitiful it was  --  that American rule of shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves in three generations  --  and how true , except that it was n't really shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves , it was shirt sleeves to soiled and shabby silks . She began to plan her day  --  that she would see Judge Everett  --  and find out what had happened and how really serious the whole thing was , and after that she would get in touch with Janie 's young man and have a talk with him . That , she knew , would be painful . There were many things she would discover , perhaps without his being aware of it , although he was clever enough . She would try anything to get Amory out of the mess , not for his sake but for Janie 's . But Judge Everett would come first . She fell asleep thinking about the first time she had ever seen him , when he had come to Newport as a young lawyer to see the Major about the ConsolidatedMills and Ore business . She remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound of the surf on the beach below the cliffs . By that time the Major had got what he wanted . Nobody stayed away from his parties any longer . He had got what he wanted without making concessions , bludgeon/ing his way through , helped by a wife who seemed made by God to suit his purpose . He had remained common and vigorous and Rabelaisian , only by that time people called it eccentricity and genius because they had to find excuses for themselves and their acceptance of him , to cover up their own vanity and weakness . That , she thought , was the root of whatever greatness he had , not that he had made great fortunes and changed the whole face of the continent , but that he remained the same to the very end , the same man who had come to the Grand Hotel of Leaping Rock in a checked suit and purple tie with a diamond in it . And as she fell asleep she remembered Judge Everett as the first man whom she had ever heard openly defy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next room having their cigars and brandy and she worked at her needlepoint , she overheard , shamelessly and with great interest , fragments of their conversation . As it progressed , it turned louder and more violent in tone as the disagreement grew stronger , and , listening , she discoveredan admiration for the young man who dared defy a man so powerful as the Major , who might make or break the whole career of a young lawyer . Toward the end , as the argument grew in violence , she heard the young lawyer say , " I 'll have nothing to do with the whole affair and I 'll advise my firm not to touch it . There are some limits , and I think , sir , that you have passed them in this business . " Then the Major said something she could not hear and she heard the young man saying , " Some day there will be a reckoning . It may not happen in your time but it is certain to come and when it comes it will be very nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will rise up and put an end to this kind of thing and you and your class will have to pay for it " Then she heard the Major speaking and knew that he had risen from his chair . This time she could hear what he said , very clearly , " You talk like an anarchist , young man , but there may be something in what you say . " " Anarchist " was an odd old-fashioned word . In those days Gus had used it the way Amory used the word " Red " to designate anyone who opposed him.  |p163Then  quietly she had slipped out to the piazza overlooking the sea and when the two men came into the room where she had been sitting , she made an ostentatiously innocent entrance from the piazza as if she had been there all the time and had heard nothing . But the young lawyer seemed a new man to her and she thought : If I had married someone like that it would have been better in spite of everything and Alice would n't be marrying a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her money as much as she wants to be a duchess . She marked the young man , then , thinking : If Gus dies before me I shall take him as my lawyer . It will make me feel respectable again . And now as she fell asleep she remembered the speech about the revolution and people catching up with men like the Major . It had happened too late to capture the Major ; it had caught instead his grandson-in-law who was only a pitiful imitation of the old Titan . When the judge called in the morning about ten o'clock he said that he had something serious to discuss with her and at once she said , " I know what it is . Amory was here last night . Is it as had as I suspect ? " " It is pretty serious . We 'll discuss it when I come over . It 's not a thing to talk about over the telephone . " After she had hung up she sat for a time staring out of the window at the dull facade of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mattie knocked and came into the bewdwar . Mrs. Parkington was aware of her presence but it lay somewhere outside the realm of actual consciousness , as if she were hypnotized by the facade opposite , although she really did not see it at all . It was the certainty that Mattic was staring at her which roused her . She turned and said , " Mattie . What is it ? " The honest , petulant , round face was filled with concern . Mattie said , " You slept badly last night . " " How do you know that ? " " By the way the bed looked . When you sleep well , the bedp164hardly looks as if it were slept in . It 's very rumpled this morning ... worse than I 've ever seen it . " She knew that Mattie was trying to pry from her some hint of what was wrong . It was possible that she had overheard her conversation with the judge , even though the door between the rooms was closed . " It was nothing , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need less sleep . " " You look very badly , " said the implacable Mattie . " You have great circles under your eyes like oysters . " " Never mind ! " Mrs. Parkington said , tartly , " I always have circles in the morning . Go about your work . " " I only spoke of it for your own good , madame , " said Mattie . She rarely used the word " madame " unless she was angry about something . Then she said , " Mr. Amory had no right to keep you so late , telling you things to worry you . " " How do you know what he told me ? " " I do n't know , but I can guess , " said Mattie , her voice dropping with insinuation . Mrs. Parkington remembered that Amory had not greeted Manic when she came into the room for the dogs . He had given no sign of being aware of her presence . That was unwise of hint since Mastic was really like one of the family , in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . " Well , it was nothing . He told inc nothing to worry me . " Mattie sniffed a sniff more eloquent that if she had said , " You need n't try to get away with lying to me . " Then she went out , artfully leaving the door ajar , but not artfully enough for the maneuver to escape Mrs. Parkington 's notice . Eavesdropping she considered an invasion of privacy although she herself had been guilty of it in the past . She called out angrily , " Please close the door , Mattie , " and the door was closed without any further commentthan the violence with which wood struck wood . Then she picked up the telephone and called Amory 's house and asked for . Janie . The sound of the girl 's voice excited and delighted her , as if somehow the quality of it gave her strength . She said , " I want to talk to Ned , my dear . Where can I reach him ? ' "  |p165Janie  gave her the telephone number and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying up from Washington . He has wonderful news , Granny . He 's been promoted . He 's going to San Francisco in the autumn . " " Will you like that ? " " Yes . I 'll love it . " " You have n't yet decided when you 're going to be married ? " " Sometime in September . " " That 's fine . " There was a pause because Mrs. Parkington , knowing what she knew , for once could not think of anything to say . Presently she said , " I just wanted to talk to Ned about some business . . . about the law and certain securities I have . " " He 'll know everything about that . " " I 'm sure he will . Drop in to see me soon . " The judge appeared at eleven-thirty . He had always been punctual . Busy people always were ; only idlers and those who had nothing on their minds could afford to waste the little time allotted to a lifetime . He was a tall , thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who carried himself very erect with an air of pride . In this Mrs. Parkington thought him justified since he had been an ambassador and a cabinet member , but above all he had led an honorable life and done much good . Always , even as far back as the night she had overheard him facing down the Major , them : had been a kind of spark , a kind of secret understanding between them . It was as if they knew something that others did not know ; when they were together they could go directly to the heart of anything , without preliminaries , without hemming and hawing or pretense or explanations of any kind . That was why she did not dread his visit now but rather welcomed it . His advice would be good and very likely she would find that he believed her judgmentcorrect . When he saw her , he said , " It 's a long time since you have sent ' for me , Susie . Much too long . " " There was nothing to prevent your coming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much with dinners any more . There seems so much to do nowadays . "  | She asked after his wife who , he said , was well except that she could not get wholly over her arthritis . The interest was one of politeness which deceived neither of them ; he had , they both knew , married too young when his mind had had little to do with his choice . His wife was both dull and frivolous but he had stuck by her because there were three children , although there were times , even now , when she exasperated him to the point of violence . Mrs. Parkington knew this and she knew that he was aware of her knowledge , although neither of them had ever spoken of it . She knew too that she herself in some ways was nearer to him in understanding than his wife had ever been . When they had gone through the whole of his family , she said , " This business of Amory is pretty bad ? " " I 'm afraid it is . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be done . He seems very vague about the whole business . I might as well explain my side of the situation . " She picked up one of the dogs and continued , " I 'll be quire frank . I 've never admired Amory . We never got on very well , even in the beginning . " " I think , " the judge smiled , " that was apparent to a good many people . Certainly it was to me . " " He was always arrogant without having anything to be arrogantabout . However , that has nothing to do with the present situation or very little at least . The point is that I want to do whatever I can to help . Above all , I should like to hush it up before it ever gets out at all . It is not a question of money . I 'm prepared for that . If paying back the whole amount will help at all I 'm perfectly willing . " There was no use in going into detail with him . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that even the loss of seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars would scarcely be noticed . The judge said , " I do n't know , Susie , how far it has gone or whether it can be mended now . Until now it has been officially none of my business . What I know I have only heard through channels which are not exactly public . However , it is beginning to get around . " He took out his wallet and from it he took a news/paper clipping . He handed it to her and said , " You see ? It is marked . " She put on her reading glasses and found the sentence he hadmarked . It was a gossip column and the sentence read : Keep watch for a scandal concerning money in which one of New York 's richest , most prominent clubmen with powerfulconnections is involved . If worst comes to worst he may have to join some of our other financiers up the river . As she came to the end she felt suddenly sick . Trying to controlherself , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it becomes known at all , there 'll be no stopping it . The temper of the country is n't what it used to be . " He did not add , " In the Major 's day , " but there was no need to say it . She said , " Do you read the gossip columns regularly ? " " I read everything . I discovered long ago that it was the best way to understand this fantastic country of ours . " " Whose securities has he used ? " she asked . " I do n't know all the names . Some of them you will know . They are friends of yours . " " In a way that makes it worse . " She heard the telephone ringing distantly and thought bitterly : I suppose that is more trouble . " What do you advise me to do , John ? " she asked . " Sit tight . i will go to work on it . If anything can be done I should be able to manage it . " Then there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Taylor came in , " It is Mrs. Sanderson 's maid , madame , " he said , " She wants to speak to you . It is urgent , she said . " Mrs. Parkington took up the telephone beside her and heard the hysterical voice of the maid . " There 's something the matter with Mrs. Sanderson , madame . I ca n't waken her . She just lies there . She wo n't speak or open her eyes . " Mrs. Parkington thought quickly : Then she is n't dead , and aloud she said , " Call Dr. Thursby at once . I 'll give you his number . " She picked up the address book beside the telephone and found the number , aware that the maid was still talking wildly into the telephone but hearing nothing she said.  | " Listen to me , " she said into the telephone . " Please be quiet for a moment . Call Dr. Thursby and ask him to come over at once . I will come immediately . " She gave the number and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " The maid repeated the number and she added , " lf Dr. Thursby is out tell them to send someone else . And put hot-water bottles at her feet and wrap her in blankets . I shall be over immediately . " She put down the telephone and said , " It 's Alice . The maid ca n't waken her . She 's been taking things to make her sleep and very likely took too much . " The judge stood up , " I can drop you . My car is outside . " Then she rang for Mattie and Mattie , tiresomely , insisted upon going with her . There was no preventing her . Mattie said firmly , " If you do n't take me , I shall run along behind the car . Maybe you would like that ? " In the car Mattie insisted on sitting in front with the driver . The judge and Mrs. Parkington sat side by side in silence , neither of them feeling any need for talk . The judge , knowing all about the Duchess and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the things that have happened to Susie , the tragedies and troubles . She is a remarkable woman to have survived them . And in her corner Mrs. Parkington was thinking about her daughter Alice , not as she was now , insensible , lying in her bed , a tired woman of sixty-five , but as she had been a long time ago before she had married and gone to France to live . It was as if there had always been a kind of blight upon Alice , from that summer long ago in Long Branch when she had worried because Alice was not as attractive as her brother Herbert . There were times when . Mrs. Parkington came near to a belief in astrology since it seemed to offer the only explanation to the strangeness and diversity in the lives of people . How otherwise could one 's life be as dull and futile as Alice 's whole life had been ? Why was it then that her own life had been a long record of the spectacular ?  --  certainly not because she herself had sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heart , was a quiet home and a pleasant unspectacular existence . It seemed to her that the whole trouble had really begun withp169Mrs . Ogden and her espousal of Alice , her determination that Alice should be attractive and make a good match . It all began with Malvina Ogden 's determination to give a great ball for Alice when she was eighteen , to push her forward , to make something of her when there was no material in Alice from which to make a brilliant career . If Malvina had only left her in peace she might have been an old maid or had a dull but respectable husband , which very clearly was the fate designed for her by nature . The worst of it was that Alice had always known she was unattractive from the very beginning when people stopped the pram and admired extravagantly the golden-haired younger brother . Separated from her brother by school , it had been ne better . It was not only that she had a sallow skin and was inclined to be pimply , but that there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had not wanted any of the things which were given her so lavishly , neither the fashionableschools nor the clothes nor the parties ; she had wanted only ' to be left in peace to become a nurse . It was the Major who in the beginning had started the long misery . In his egotism and exuberance his children and even his wife were mere appendages and trappings of his success . No daughter of his would become so humble a thing as a trained nurse ; his daughter must make a great match and make a glorious success in her life . It did not matter that his daughter had none of the qualities this demanded  --  neither the looks , nor the brilliance , nor the hardness . She was only a plain , dull , sentimental girl , immensely rich , who wished only to sink out of sight . Mrs. Parkington remembered well the quarrels , the violence , that marked the whole period . It was the only real violence , they were the only real quarrels she and the Major had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always there was pitted against her not only Gus but Mrs. Ogden who had made of Alice one of her causes . And then Alice herself had deserted her mother . Some odd thing happened to her , something which even now Mrs. Parking-:nn had never understood . The girl had said suddenly , " Vertp170well ! I shall go to parties and wear fine clothes and do all the things Father wishes . " And after that , her dullness took on a quality of chillness and indifference . Gus and Mrs. Ogden had their way , and at the great ball given by Mrs. Ogden , Alice wore a gown from Worth and the pearls her father had given her which reached halfway to her knees , and she had dozens of bouquets and her dance card was filled far in advance of the ball , but she had never believed in her own success . She knew that the flowers and the invitations came only because she was Major Parkington 's daughter and Mrs. Ogden 's protegee and because no one dared oppose so formidable a combination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Duke came to New York to stay with Malvina Ogden , clearly looking for a rich wife , poor Alice was the obviousvictim , wafting like a sacrificial heifer in Worth clothes and pearls , to become the Duchess de Brantes . There was nothing Mrs. Parkington could do , for the girl herself wanted it , perhaps because she could , by becoming a duchess , stifle her own sense of her dreariness and compensate for past humiliations . In the back of the judge 's car , Mrs. Parkington sighed heavily , so heavily that the judge looked at her without being noticed at all . It was as if Alice had been doomed from the beginning , and now she was perhaps dying , having suffered much unhappiness and countless indignities without ever having lived at all . Suddenly the car was at the door of the apartment house and the judge got down to help her out and Mattie got down from beside the driver . Mrs. Parkington felt suddenly weary and filled with despair . It had gone on and on like this for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in trouble and they were all Goddamneddull and tiresome and scarcely worth the trouble . When Gus died , she thought she could do as she pleased , but it had only turned out to be worse than when he was alive . She thought : If only Herbert or Eddie had lived , I would have had someone ... One could have forgiven them many things because they were handsome and gay and alive and attractive . But all the others , all except Janie , had no brightness . They had no right to call upon her.  |p171She  pulled herself together and managed to say good-by to the judge and went into the apartment house on the arm of Mattie . On the way in she thought , apparently for no reason at all , of the cowboy Al , and felt a sudden intense desire to sec him again , as if somehow his simplicity and quietness could give her the strength she needed . The doctor was already there , a short grave humorless man of sixty with a small goatee and very shiny eyeglasses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parkington . The Duchess was one of his charges and Mrs. Parkington paid him well  --  a yearly salary  --  to care for her daughter . After they had exchanged greetings , he said , " She has taken an over-dose of sleeping stuff . I think she will be all right . She has a very strong heart and a good constitution . " It was odd how perverse nature could be , to give to Alice the physique and constitution of an ox , when Alice did not care whether she lived or died and had not cared for many years . " Have you sent for a nurse ? " asked Mrs. Parkington . " Yes . She should be here in half an hour . " " I 'm wondering whether it would not be wise to keep a nurse , permanently . " The doctor looked at her . " You mean it might prevent this happening again ? " " Yes . " " It might be a good idea if Mrs. Sanderson would consent . " " I think she will consent , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shall I leave it for you to arrange ? " " If you like . " " I think a middle-aged woman , rather gossipy , would be best . It might help divert Mrs. Sanderson . " " I think I know just the woman , " he said . " If that 's all , I 'll go to her room . " " That 's all . I 'll wait until the nurse arrives . " Mrs. Parkington crossed to the hallway leading to the bed- room . In the doorway she turned and said , " Thank you , Doctor . Thank you for everything . " He only bowed without answering her . It was extraordinary how they had held a whole conversation without mentioning what lay at the root of it  --  that Alice had taken an over-dose of sleeping medicine , not because she meant to take her life but only because she had been drinking alone , in her own flat . She was not the temperament to be tempted by suicide ; drunkards seldom were . Each time they drink , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the maid , was sitting bolt upright on a chair by the bed , ostentatiously keeping watch over her mistress . Emily was a thin parched virgin , butte hysterical and calculating . Mrs. Parkington was an immensely rich woman who might die leaving her daughterin the care of her maid and Emily wanted no mistake made concerning the fact of her devotion . There might be legacies to faithful servants and devoted retainers , of the sort Emily had read about in the newspaper accounts of the wills of rich and fashionable people like Mrs. Parkington . She might have chosen a comfortable chair , but the effect would not have been so good , so eloquent of Emily 's vigilance and devotion . Mrs. Parkington was not deceived by Emily 's charades . She said , " Good morning , " briskly and then said , looking at Alice who lay , on her back breathing through her mouth , " How did it happen , Emily ? " Emily , already on her feet , said , " I do n't know , madame . Mrs. Sanderson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was alone here and already asleep when I came in . " If things had been different and they were more sympathetic , Alice might have been dining at home with her mother instead of drinking alone in her own flat . Mrs. Parkington sighed , thinkinghow yellow her daughter 's skin looked against the white pillow . She reproached herself for not having made enough effort with Alice , although she could not think what more she could have done . It was difficult to deal with people who were both dull and bitter . Alice had been like that since she was seventeen . " You need n't wait here , " said Mrs. Parkington to Emily , " I'llp173stay until she comes round . Ask cook if she has a chop or a couple of eggs . " Then Emily went out leaving Mrs. Parkington alone with her daughter . When the maid had gone the old woman opened the window a little wider to let in the soft spring air and then seated herself in a comfortable chair where she could watch her daughter . The weariness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if Alice were dead and had achieved that peace whi h comes to some people only in death . Beneath the flabbiness the e , were other faces , very clear in the memory of Mrs. Parkingtothe face of Alice as a young girl on the day she married the Du e when , for a little time , she was happy because as a rich bri e marrying a famous name she was for once genuinely import t and envied by girls much prettier and more attractive than herself . All that had meant a great deal to Alice . And there was the face of Alice when everything was finished and she had returned home from France with bitter lines about her mouth and a dull look of suffering in the hyperthyroid ey s . And the face of Alice when she married that cheap English remittance man who kept other women out of the allowance sae gave him . And the aging middle-aged face that married for tae third time a middle-aged , sexless widower called Sanderson , fromPasadena . He was not even attractive . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each time it was money which had made Alice desirable ; each time it was money which betrayed her into an unhappy marriage . Each time the man was a little les attractive . With all his faults the Duke was the best of the lot All three marriages had ended only in disaster and humiliation . Quietly , as she waited , she fell to thinking of the Duke . She had not really thought of him for many years , save when the papers recorded his death at the age of fifty in the Battle of ' Verdun . Until then he had written to her once or twice a year , as if the whole misery of his marriage to Alice had never happened at all . Sometimes she acknowledged the letters with a formal line of two as a woman of the world , but more often she left them unanswered . But it had made no difference . He went on writing topI74 her just the same , charming letters , filled with wit and flattery ; very Gallic , faintly impudent letters in which at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had written , " It can be a tragedy for a plain daughter to have a mother who is pretty and charming . It has , in fact , been a tragedy in more than one life . " The letter had made her unhappy for it revealed suddenly something which she had never considered until then and which now became clear to her  --  that Alice had been jealous of her because Gus had loved her so deeply , that she had been jealous of , her because her brothers had adored their mother , and because they themselves were so much brighter and more handsome . It Ode her understand many things like the sullenness and defiance of Alice as a young girl and her sudden almost joyous submission to the will and schemes of Mrs. Morton Ogden . Presently , wondering why the nurse had not yet come , Mrs. Parkington fell into a doze in which the past and present were hopelessly mixed . She was in Newport again in the great marble huse , in June when Newport was loveliest , and the house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere , caterers and florists and men hanging garlands of Chinese lanterns among the flowering trees , for Gus was making a typical Parkington effort . His daughter was about to marry a peer of France , to become a duchess , and this was to be the greatestwedding anyone had ever seen . ! Herbert and Eddie were very good about it , although Eddie who was seventeen , thought it was all a lot of tripe and said so . And the Blair girl , Amelie , was there staying in the house because Herbert seemed linable to live without her . She was nineteen , Herbert 's own age , a tall , slim girl , a little mad like all the Blairsyounever knew when or how the Blair eccentricities would break out . Thus far Amelie had done nothing worse than dress like a Botticelli and wear fresh flowers in her hair , which made her atp175times seem more like Ophelia than a Botticelli spring . Mrs. Parkingtonhoped the attraction was puppy love because it was n't a good thing for anyone to marry a Blair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of turning Herbert against herself  --  and Herbertwas more to her than any of the children , a fact which she acknowledged to herself but hid away shamefully in the deepest part of her . He was still in a way the beautiful baby in the pram whom everyone stopped to admire . There was something clear and bright about him with his fair hair and blue eyes and the vigor of his father . It was that vigor which kept him always in trouble , driving him on and on without relief , since he , unlike his father at the same age , already had everything . And so it was girls and pleasure , and now it was the Blair girl who moved about and spoke in an affected voice . It was odd , Mrs. Parkington thought , how life went round and round , turning up the most unlikely happenings . Amelie Blair was the granddaughter of Goodhue Blair whom Gus had saved from ruin because Harriette came all the way to Long Branch that hot summer afternoon to intercede for him . Eddie , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild and precocious and good-looking . Already he had been sent home from St. Bart 's for bringing a case of beer into the dormitory . His father planned to send him out West into one of the mines " to straighten him out , " but secretly Gus admired his wild adolescentyoung son because he was like himself . " I was only sixteen when I got . a girl into trouble , " he had boasted once to Susie . He would never see that his case and the cases of his sons were not in the least alike . A young man without a penny and colossal fierce ambitions could be as wild as he liked without harm because the fierceness of his ambitions would keep him going straight . It was different with two boys who already had all the things their father wanted . Their very good looks conspired to ruin them . But Gus would never listen to her . He wanted his children to have all the things he had never had as a boy , and always his sons were , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be brilliant and clever because they were his sons . Their successes , their good looks , their marriages , were only a part of his ownp176immense and complicated pattern of success . Gus wanted to swallow the whole world ; that it did not wreck him meant only that he had the vigor , the hardness and constitution of a mythical figure . That day of the wedding was not a happy one . All day Susie worried and fretted , not about the details of the wedding which she left to Aspasie with her French talent for such things , but about her own family and this marriage which depressed her . And then about noon , the Duke appeared at the house to have a look at all the confusion . 1-lc was a neatly made young man of twenty-nine , overtired , with a rather lean face and dark , passionateeyes and a faintly effeminate manner , good-humored and agreeable enough but decidedly not what Susie in her wisdom would have chosen for a son-in-law . When he was with Gus , Susie felt a persistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so little of understanding between them . The very air seemed to crackle with absurdity . And now the Duke had come to pay his respects to her before lunch and with revulsion she faced what she had determined to do before he sailed with Alice on the " Carpathia " for London . She had to do it because there existed between her husband and her future son-in-law no ground whatever on which they might discuss the intimate things which troubled her . She took him into her small sitting-room overlooking the sea and sent for sherry and when they were served , she said boldly , " Jacques , this is the last time we shall see each other before the wedding . There are one or two things I should like to say . " " Yes , belle-mere , " he said , smiling . " Alice is not a beautiful girl . " He frowned suddenly , " She is not a beauty , but she is pleasant-looking  --  jolie-laide . " Susie did not deceive herself . This was flattery and also an effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bride . To be a jolie-laide one had to have spirit and brains . Aspasie was a jolie-laide if you like , even now when she was over fifty . " I want you to be good to her for that reason . "  | " Of course I shall be good to her , belle mere . " He said it glibly . He was altogether too smooth and cynical for her taste . " I think I understand the basis of this marriage , " she said , and without blushing he answered , " Yes . " The terms were good , thought Susie . Gus had seen to that . " There was a fund set up which would give the Duke one hundred thousand a year so long as he lived , half of - it for the upkeep of the estates , half for himself . " What I am trying to say is painful , " she continued , forcing the words out with a great effort . " To be quite honest I was always against the marriage but Alice wanted it and Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sort of marriage . " He started to speak but she raised her hand , " Let me finish , " she said , " It will be easier that way . " He sank back in his chair and the passionate mocking eyes turned cold . " I am not asking you to love Alice . I can not even ask you the impossible  --  to be faithful to her . I am only asking you to be kind and considerate of her and not to make her more unhappy than she is already . If and when you are unfaithful , I only ask you to be discreet about it and never let her know or let her be humiliatedby the knowledge that other people know . Treat her with dignity as your wife and possibly the mother of your children . I do not think she is a demanding girl . Only be kind and con-siderate . " Even as she spoke she felt the force going out of her so that ; he speech ended weakly . She had the impression he was not listening at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mockery and cynicism , believing that she was very naive and bourgeois . Then he said , surprisingly , " I will take very good care of your daughter , belle-mere . You need not worry . You seem to be a wise woman and a very frank one . I have sometimes wished I was marrying you instead of Alice . Your husband is a very fortunate man . " It was a strange thing to say , but she thanked him for it . It seemed very odd to her that she should be talking like an old woman to this man who was only eight years younger than her- self and in some ways immensely older and more tired than she would ever be . Then they talked of other things and presently Aspasie knocked on the door and came in and said that Alice wanted to see her .. The Duke went out and for a moment Aspasie stood looking after hirn , the proud firm profile outlined against the brilliant blue of the June sea . Susie watched her and after a moment she asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome as she always did when she was angry , said , " There is no reason why I should not be honest . I was thinking what a voyou he is . " There was certainly no reason why she and Aspasie should not be honest with each other , considering how long and close their friendship had been and the strange circumstances in which it had been born . " Alice is hysterical , " she said , " Now she does n't want to go through with the wedding . You 'll have to force her . " " I do n't know whether she is not right . " " She may be right but one ca n't behave like that , " said Aspasie simply , " Let her marry him . It does not matter . If she does not marry him , it will be another like him . She is a doomed girl . " So she went down and quieted Alice who had suddenly taken en unreasonable and passionate dislike to the Duke , and as she sat with the girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her maid arriving in the victoria . Mrs. Ogden sat bolt upright , triumphantly . She had grown immensely heavy so that her side of the victoria sagged . Her horselike ugliness was emphasizedby the green traveling costume she wore . She looks , thought Susie , as if this were her day  --  as if it were her daughter who was being married . In a way it was . She had " put over " the Parkingtons . No one would stay away from this party . There were even people who through Harriette and Aspasie had begged for invitations . Gus had what he wanted and Mrs. Ogden . It was odd that even after years of apparent intimacy , she could never think of the woman as " Malvina " but only as " Mrs. Ogden . " Then in another victoria Harriette arrived . She looked ruddy and well and was dressed , despite her thick middle-aged figure , inp179a frilly costume much too young for her . Her " poor father " had been dead for seven years now , and with the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cats and dogs and was happy and blooming . It was strange , thought Susie , what curious and diverse satisfactions people demanded from life . For the rest of the day Harriette bustled about the house , feelingimportant as a friend of the rich and fashionable Mrs. Parkington , distracting the servants and strewing confusion wherever she went . She had gone a long way since that first evening at the Brevoort when she had blushed at being seen dining with the notorious Major Augustus Parkington and his bride . And there was Henry Parkington come down from the GeneseeValley with his bride , the farmer 's daughter , dressed , both of them , carelessly and awkwardly . Their presence did n't please Gus but it gave Susie , amid all the flowers and decorations and hubbub , a sudden sense of having some contact with reality . Henry 's wife was pregnant and showed it but it seemed to trouble neither Henry nor herself . Already people were beginning to say that Henry was crazy , but Susie did n't think so ; it seemed to her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , the kind of sense which had begun to disappear utterly from the lives of herself and Gus in spite of anything she could do . She took Henry 's wife , whose name was Ida , under her wing and saw to it that , amid all the confusion , she had rest and quiet something for which Ida did not appear to have any need or any desire . But it left Henry free to wander about staring at guests and decorations and making rude remarks . He was irrepressible , like a handsome young stallion , turned into pasture . Herbert 's girl , Amelie Blair , took a great liking for him and Aspasie herself took him over at the end of the day . Susie knew that he could n't be crazy if Aspasie approved of him . She had never been wrong about anyone . And then as Mrs. Parkington was watching Aspasie and Henry talking in an alcove hung with smilax , she heard the sound of taxi horns in a day when there were no taxis and opened her eyes suddenly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taxi horns coming in the open window from Park Avenue , andp180Alice , an old woman , unconscious , was lying on the bed . Before Mrs. Parkington was standing Emily , the maid , who said that the nurse had arrived at last and that lunch was served . Would she still like it on a tray or in the dining room ? The nurse was a big woman of about forty called Mrs. Dodsworth , with a kindly face . Mrs. Parkington thought she might do very well for a permanent companion for Alice . Time would tell . The memories of Newport and the wedding stayed with her , pleasantly , as memories have a way of doing with old people who have lived a full rich life , and it was not until the middle of lunch that she remembered Amory and his trouble and that she had forgotten to call Ned Talbot who was so important in the whole affair . She sent Emily to get the number for her and , although it was in the midst of the lunch hour , Ned was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of pleasure and reassurance . Ile said , " l have just come back from Washington . " And when she asked if he could come in at teatime to see her about something important , he said , " I have arranged to meet Janie . May I bring her ? " " No . I think better not . We had better be alone . " " All right . I 'll call her . I 'm sure she wo n't mind . " About three o'clock the Duchess opened her eyes and the nurse came to tell Mrs. Parkington who was reading in the drawing room . " I 'd like to see her alone , " said Mrs. Parkington . " Of course , " replied Mrs. Dodsworth and Mrs. Parkington thought : She is going to be all right . She 's not a fool like Emily . At first the Duchess only stared at her mother out of the nearsightedeyes , not recognizing her . Then as she heard her voice , she said , " I 'm sorry to have bothered you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's no trouble , my dear . I 'm only happy it was n't more serious . I 've been here since this morning . "  |p181Mrs  . Parkington drew up a chair beside the bed and the Duchess made a faint effort to sit up and then gave it up and lay back again , " How long have I been asleep ? " she asked . " Since last night . How do you feel ? " " A little woozy . I can not imagine how it happened . The nurse said I took too much sleeping stuff . " " Yes . The doctor is coming again at four . " Then the Duchess closed her eyes again , with a sigh of infinite weariness , and said , " It was very pleasant . I do n't remember any . thing at all . " Her mother thought : She must n't get that idea or she 'll be tryingsuicide . Aloud she said , " It 's very bad for you , very depressingphysically . If I were you I 'd try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She did n't speak about keeping on the nurse . That could wait . Now , it might only disturb her . " I 'll go now and you go back to sleep . I have a business appointmentat five and I 'll try to come back later . " She rose from the chair and Alice did not appear to hear or notice her . She had slipped back again into that world of peace and oblivion where there were no memories and no unhappiness and nothing at all happened . The doctor returned at four and said she would be all right now and Mrs. Parkington went home with an odd feeling that her daughter had been snatched from death against her will . This raised in her mind a moral issue  --  should not people be allowed to die , if they chose . Their lives belonged to them alone . It should be their right to die if they preferred it , just as if they willed to go from one room into another . Sometimes it was a kind of torture to force them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that with Alice . Alice was already dead . She walked and created a semblance of life but already she was dead . She had really been dead for a long time . There were few memories even to which she would want to return . In England , Mrs. Parkington remembered , they arrested people for attempting suicide . That , surely , was the height of absurdity . England made her think again of Harry Haxton and all his class , in fact all the Conservative party . They had been commit-182 MR5 . PARKINOTONp182ting mass suicide for more than a quarter of a century , ever since she and Gus knew them well in the days of their friendship with the Prince . Sometimes it seemed to her that the era in which she and Gus lived had been made especially for them  --  a wide-open , hell-bentfor-leathertime in which a man like Gus could go all out , wide open , on a career so ambitious that most men would have trembledeven to contemplate it . If he had been born earlier , the opportunity of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he had come to full flower in this new crumbling world he would have spent half his life in jail . Even the Prince with his liking for horse racing and Jews and actresses and Americansand all the wrong people had been made for Gus . It was extraordinary how Gus and the Prince had got on , how well the son of Queen Victoria and the millionaire-adventurer on the make , had understood each other . They had been friends from that very first poker game in the house in Park Lane . But all that world was vanished now , swept away , shattered in the dustbins of time . She had the present to deal with and the future . Ned would be waiting for her . Taylor had taken him into the small sitting-room , observing that Mrs. Parkington would certainly be in very shortly as she was always on time for appointments . Ned looked at his watch and said , " It does n't matter . In any case , I 'm early . " He was early because all the afternoon he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him and why she wanted to see him alone . The old imagination , the source of most of his unhappiness , had leapt into action , creating worry after worry  --  that the old lady was opposed to his marriage with Janie , that she had discovered his small part in uncovering the crime of Janie 's father and was angry ; that she meant to use him in some obscure fashion . From each of these worries sprang smaller ones , so that by the time he reached Mrs. Parkington 's small sitting room he was prepared for anything at all . He sat on the edge of the chair listening for some sound of her arrival.  |p183It  came at last , the sound of the motor , after an interminable time of waiting . And after he heard the sound of the footsteps of the butler opening the door , hours again seemed to pass before Mrs. Parkington herself stood in the doorway , smiling at him the curious , crinkled wise smile which had made him trust her when he had seen her before . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . She is n't against me . She came toward him holding out her hand and saying , " I 'm sorry if I 'm late . My whole day has been upset and confused . Everything seems to go wrong . When one starts off a day being late one is apt to grow later and later as the day advances . " Then she turned to Taylor and asked him to bring tea , " Unless , " she said to Ned , " You 'd like something stronger . " " No , thank you . Tea will do . " She seated herself by the fire and said , " It was very good of you to change your plans and come . I hope Janie was n't dis-appointed . " " No . That 's all right . We 're dining together in any case . And I had good news for her . I 've been promoted in the service . I 'm being sent to San Francisco . " " I 'm delighted to hear that , " said Mrs. Parkington and thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from New York , out of everythinginto a new world . Then Taylor brought the tea and she asked him to close the door . There was a little silence while her small blue-veined hands covered with rings moved about the silver and porcelain on the tea tray and as he watched her Ned thought : She looks so fragile and weak , but she is n't fragile or weak . She 's tough as nails and strong as a lion . It was the kind of strength born , he thought , of experience and wisdom and a perfect adjustment to life . People felt the strength in her ; that was why they came to her when they were in trouble . He heard her saying , " I 've forgotten how you like it . I 'm never very good about things like that . " " Milk and one lump , please . " He rose to take the cup from her , feeling for no reason at all suddenly very young and awkward . He thought : As a youngp184woman she must have been fascinating  --  gentle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even at her age she gave you a strong sense of her femininity and charm . And then it occurred to him that when she was a young girl she must have been very like Janie . . . Janie without that sadness which clung to her even when she laughed . When he had reached his chair again and sat down , she said abruptly , " I suppose you 've been wondering why I was so serious about our seeing each other alone . It 's because I had to talk to you about my grandson-in-law , Amory . " So that was it , after all . Someone had told her . " He was here last night . Ile told me the whole story . You probably know as much of it as he does . " " Yes , " said Ned gravely . She was making it easier than he had hoped . Her voice was very quiet and sure and above all , casual . " He has a strange point of view about the whole thing . . . as if what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it . I do n't suppose you 're very used to that kind of attitude . It grows out of his background and upbringing . " Ile could not think exactly how to answer this . He managed to say , " It is a strange point of view . I 've run into it more often than you 'd suppose . It 's a kind of class attitude . " " My husband had the same attitude but with him it was a kind of grotesque egoism , and individuality . . . rugged , I believe they used to call it . . . rugged individualism . He was always alone  --  an individual . He never belonged to any class . On the other hand he accomplished a great many remarkable and stupendousthings . " Ned thought : She does n't deceive herself there . She knows he was a robber and a crook . " But you must not be too narrow about a man like Major Parkington . He was a character . There were a lot of characters in those days . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's classes and class feeling that arc dangerous in a democracy , " she said . " If ever our people congeal into classes , then our democracy is lost . Individuals may be as bad as they like without too much harm . It 's only when they gang up that they become dangerous.  |p185You  see Amory is n't really an individual like the Major . He goes about in gangs  --  his old school , his old college , his clubs and stockbrokerfriends , his industrial associates . They gang together out of a mental need to reinforce each other , because none of them is big enough to stand alone . They keep telling each other that they have greater advantages than most people , that because they run this or that business or factory they are God-sent geniuses , that because they have the knack of making a little money , they are privileged and above law or control , that they know better than anyone about everything . And so a large part of the time they hover near to the edge of what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't accomplish very much  --  nothing like building the railroads and opening up the West . It 's a singular , hypocritical and corrupt point of view , but Amory believes in it . In his heart he thinks he is right and the law is wrong . " She smiled and made a clucking sound , " Well , well , I 've deliveredquite a lecture on something you have perhaps thought out for yourself . I only venture to speak because I lived through so much at very close range . I 've known most of the old giants  --  they were always in the house  --  and I know a good many of these others who huddle together like bison for protection . That 's what rotted England . It 's what produced men like Chamberlain and Sam Hoare and John Simon  --  a gang of Brahmins conspiring to keep the world under control for their own little group . Queen Elizabeth thought first of the glory of England  --  so did Pitt and Melbourne and Gladstone and Disraeli . No , the point of view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . They added up to the ruin of France as well  --  the little men who sold out to protect their own property . " She laughed and said , " I ca n't seem to stop myself but I do n't often have an opportunity to talk to someone like you . Most of the people I see are old and belong to another world that doesn'tist any more , or they belong to Amory 's tight , blind , doomed little world . I do n't have much chance to exercise my brains , such es they are . " Opposite her , the young man had fallen into a state of utter quiescence and receptivity , willing to listen without speaking.  |p186He  knew now why Janie said that it was difficult to get Mrs. Parkington to talk much about any but trivial things , but that when she did talk the conversation was stimulating . There was so much she could tell if she ever chose to tell , so much she knew which she could share if she chose to share it . He found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only alert but that it continued to grow and adapt itself , instead of turning set and bitter as happened so often to the minds of rich old people . By way of response he said , " I 've tried to think out a lot of these things but of course I 'm always hampered by lack of experience . You read this and that about people like Major Parkington , but it 's never the saute as having known them . The people who write of them always ntanagc to inject their own personalities into the picture . Either they are muckrakers who find no good in them or they arc paid to whitewash them by the family which sets out to prove they were saints . " Mrs. Parkington laughed , " They certainly were n't saints , but they were n't as evil as the reformers would have you believe . We have a book like that about Major Parkington . I did n't pay to have it written but some of his friends did  --  I think in the hope that some of the whitewash applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was what they wanted . " She gave him another cup of tea and said a little wearily , " Of course it 's about Amory 's case I wanted to talk . I think to begin with you 'd better understand my point of view . I 've no special interest in Amory himself . I 've never liked him but that 's beside the point . When you get to my age and are still reasonably in possession of your faculties , you acquire , if you have any sense , a certain objectivity , even about the members of your own family . When your glands begin to slow down , you begin to acquire wisdom rather than to practice emotion . I do n't much care what happens to Amory. l le deserves whatever happens , but I want to do all I can to help him for only one reason and that is Janie . Perhaps you guessed that . " For a moment he could n't answer her . Moisture came into his eyes and a lump into his throat and at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , damn it ! " Then he managed to say , " Thank you , because Janie means a lot to me . " " You can help Janie , " she said , " You can take her away . You can give her a chance . If you do n't she may just marry anybody and turn out like all the others , God help her . And I think you had better do it quickly . " He felt suddenly embarrassed and shy . It was not that she had complimented him extravagantly in words , it was what she implied . What he did not understand was the liking , very close to maternal love , which she had felt for him at sight , and the thought that had come to her not once but many times  --  that if things had been different , her own sons might have been like this , the sons who had been dead for nearly forty years , who had never really had any chance . She was saying , " I had better make my point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken . If we ca n't save him from jail , we can at least prevent people from saying that Janie 's father robbed them . I should like to prevent his going to jail , even from being indicted . Do you think it is too late to prevent that ? " He was silent for a moment . Then he said , " I do n't know . I 'm no longer close enough to the case . I had very little to do with the whole thing beyond the original investigation . That 's my part of the job , not the prosecution . But I should think the whole thing has gone too far to be stopped now . The case is a very clear one  --  almost hopelessly clear and simple . " He put down his cup and said , " You have been very honest with me . May I be as honest with you ? " " It 's the only way we shall get anywhere . " " Mr. Stilham must be a very stupid man to think he could get away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She sighed and said , " I am afraid he is a very stupid man . " " You see , he ' even tried to buy me off . That was how I came to meet Janie , the weekend he asked me to the country . He proposedpaying me ten thousand dollars to turn in a report which covered him up . That too was very stupid of him . It proved that he had no understanding of what was going on in the world . In188 MRS- PARKINGTONp188any case my report war almost finished . Too many people in the department knew of it . Even if I had been dishonest , I could not have done it . It was too late . " Then he hesitated for a moment looking down at his hands , as if considering whether he dared to say all he meant to say . Mrs. Parkington at watching him , without speaking , liking his reasonableness and the clearness of his mind , that he did not say priggishly that ha had turned down the offer of a bribe because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was too late for him to accept it . She knew well enough from the face that he was not the kind that could be bribed . Amory , if he had had ally instinct or wisdom , could have known it . The boy was talking again , " He was very angry with me , as if I were in the wrong for what I had done . He talked about interference with private rights and spying and persecution . He seemed obsessed by the idea of persecution of himself and his class . " " He talked to me in exactly the same way . " " There is something in the persecution angle  --  very little  --  but something , and even that something Mr. Stilham does not understand. l le does n't understand that lie and his class ' have been put into a strait jacket because of the lawlessness of the generation or two before him . Because they were so crooked , the whole thing became intolerable and so the revolution came . That is why so little can be done to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question of bribing or honesty . No one would dare to help him in the face of public feeling . In a way , he and a lot of others like him are sacrifices of atonement for the sins of men who are already gone . " " For Major Parkington and his friends , " she said . " Yes , that 's true . " Mrs. Parkington looked at her watch , " What time were you meeting Janie ? " " As near six-thirty as possible . It does n't matter . She 'll wait . " " No . Do n't keep her waiting . Before you go there 's one morething I wanted to say . . . . " He waited and saw the color rising in Mrs. Parkington 's face . She frowned a little and then said ,  | " It 's just this . If there 's any way of buying Amory out of this ... if there 's anyone susceptible , you need only mention it to me , quite casually . The money does n't make any difference . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd do almost anything to help Janie out of this , Mrs. Parkington . I hope you understand that . " " I do . " " It 's too late and anyway I doubt that any of those concerned could be bought off . " " It 's different from my husband 's day . I 'm aware of that . He bought his way in and out of a great many things . Always it was a good investment . " Then very quietly she added , " It was profitable for himself . But he destroyed the souls of two or three men who might otherwise have died honorably and two or three went to prison because of him . And a lot of women and children suffered . The curious thing is that so far as he was concerned , there seemed to have been no retribution . " " No . It has fallen on the second and third generation . The whole country has had to pay for it . " She stood up and said , " Now , I 'm going to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came across the room . She continued speaking , " Does she have any suspicion about any of this ? " " No . Not yet . I 'm sure she would have spoken to me about it . " She laid one hand on his shoulder and looked up into his face . " There 's one more thing I want to ask you and that is , when and if it becomes necessary , you 'll let me do the talking . I am old enough to understand a lot of things . I think I can do it better than anyone else , with less hurt . " " Sometimes , " he said , " I 've thought I should be the one to do the telling . " " No . Things like that leave scars that can never be got rid of , no matter how hard you try . Believe me , I know . And she might get some ideas that she ought not to marry you because she was ruining your career . She 's fantastic in some ways . You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise , wo n't you ? Believe me , I 'm being wise about it . I must n't spoil things between the two of you . That is worth saving . All the rest , all the others are mere rubbish . "  |p190He  was thoughtful for a moment , looking away from hey Then he said , " Very well . I 'll leave it to you ... , " She turned toward the door and as they walked , side by side , the very old woman and the very young man , she said , " This afternoon was the first time in eighty-four years I ever attempted to bribe anyone . It cost me a great deal to say what I did , but what things cost me does not matter any longer . " At the door , she said , " It was very strange of you to go on seeing Janie when you knew what you did . I wondered why you did it . " They were alone now in the hall . Shc did not ring for Taylor to help hint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understandingbetween them broken , even by the presence of a mute servant . He said , " I felt sorry for Janie . Then that weekend we went for long walks and while we were together I began to understand what was inside Janie and that she was unhappy and there was something between us which I 'd never felt with any other girl . We kind of understood each other without saying anything as if we were meant for each other . And when I went away I kept thinking of her and then one afternoon I called her up and asked her to dine . And when she saw me she said , I was afraid you had forgotten all about mc . I was hoping you had n't . ' I knew what I was doing . There was a moment when I could have pulled out , but I did n't . We 'll make out all right  --  no matter what happens . " He had never said any of this before , even to Janie . Mrs. Parkington standing here , small and very straight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy for him . " It 's going to be tough for Janie . You 'll have to help me . " " You can count on me . " She took his hand and held it between her two thin beringed hands , " You 're a good boy . Good-by and good luck . " After he had gone out the door , she stood for a little time staring at nothing at all , thinking of her own boys and that perhapsnow , as a very old woman , she had , at last , found someone to take their place . But for Gus  --  but for all the things which had come between her and them , despite anything she could do ... .  |p191Then  she turned and walked toward the elevator . It was too late now to think about all that , too late by forty years ... . She had meant to return to the fiat of the Duchess after dinner but when she went to her own room to spruce up a bit she found Mattie blocking her way . Mattie had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parkington at the door of the cupboard which contained her hats , Mattie said abruptly , " I hope you are not thinking of going out , madame . " That she used the word " madame " instead of addressing her mistress as Mrs. Parkington set the tone of the encounter . Mrs. Parkington said with as much firmness as possible , " I am going over to Mrs. Sanderson 's . " Mattie said , " Have you looked at yourself in the mirror ? You look as if you had been dragged through a knothole . " Mrs. Parkington went on firmly selecting a hat without answering , but Mattie continued , " Bags under your eyes , madame , and a yellow face . You should go to bed early and not leave the house . Mrs. Sanderson is probably all right . I will get the nurse on the telephone . If you-need to go over , I 'll go with you . " As Mrs. Parkington took down a hat and turned from the cupboard , Mattie was already dialing a number . The sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angered by Mattie . She said , " Leave that telephone alone , Mattie . I am still able to decide things for myself . " But Mattie ignored her . She finished dialing and got the number . The silly maid , Emily , answered but Mattic would have none of her . She asked for the nurse . During the waiting , Mrs. Parkington sat down at her dressing table and put on her hat and at the same time it gave her an excuse to study her face in the glass . It did look saggy and tired and yellow . It certainly did . Then she heard Mattie lying over the telephone . " Just a moment . Mrs. Parkington asked me to call you . She is right here . " She carried the telephone to the dressing table and put it down before her mistress . The voice of the nurse came over the wire , warm and con/rident and pleasing to Mrs. Parkington . As she listened , Mrs. Parkington thought : Very likely she will do . It will only be necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanderson , the nurse said , was sleeping . The doctor reported that she would be all right now . " There 's no need to come over , Mrs. Parkington . She 'll be able to see you in the morning . " As she put down the telephone , she realized that Mattie was standing very near  --  nt ar enough to hear what the nurse said , so that her mistress would n't be able to lie and cheat about the conversation . " You see , " said Mattie , " There 's no use killing yourself for nothing . " Mrs. Parkington felt a slight sense of irritation at defeat by Mattie 's superior tactics . She lifted the hat from her head and said , " Please go about your work , Mattie , and stop haggling me . " Mattie only said , " Now take off your clothes and get into bed . I 'll bring you sonic warm milk in a thermos jug and you can have a good rest . " But the nagging was not yet finished . Mattie went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment she returned to hang up the clothes and put away the hat and as she went about the tasks she said , " I think it 's a shame the way the family imposes on you . They 're certainly old enough to take care of themselves when they get into trouble . There 's no use in their always running in and out of the house to put their worries on you . " Mrs. Parkington glanced at her , suspicious that Mattie knew something about Amory , but Mattie 's round , plump face was perfectly blank save for the fine lines born of her irritation about the mouth and eyes . She kept right on talking , " Sometime I 'm going to break out and speak my mind . I think it 's awful  --  the way they all hang on you . " She brought a nightdress and dressing gown and laid them on the arm of the chair beside her mistress , asserting herself by a faint snort of rage . Mrs. Parkington did not answer her and was not worried by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " break out " at the people she said imposed on her mistress , but never yet had she done so . Then she said , " The bed is turned down . I 'll go and fetch the milk . " When Mattie had gone , Mrs. Parkington got into bed and adjusted the reading light . She was glad now that Mattie had bullied her into staying at home for it meant that she would have the whole evening alone , without family , without committees , without all the people who were always wanting things from her . Solitude was the most precious thing in the world if you knew how to employ it . It built up your endurance , and permitted you to see yourself coldly , with all your faults and virtues ; it allowed you to get some sort of perspective on things . It made it possible to face and to endure many things which otherwise would have been unendurable . If you suffered in solitude , there was no need to parade your suffering shamefully in public . Solitude was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . They did not sap his boisterous vitality ; on the contrary he seemed to absorb fresh and inordinate suppliesof vitality by mere contact with people . Some he had destroyed temporarily ; a few , among them the people who worked for him , he destroyed permanently . Even when he was alone , his whole mind and body , untouched by reflection , were occupied and absorbed by planning fresh actions calculated to realize his vast ambitions or promote and feed the monstrous appetite of his egotism . When Gus was alone in a room behind locked doors , there was no solitude ; alone on a desert island there would have been none , for the very air was always infested by the shadows of people , of plans , of plots , of tremendous events . He had never understood her own hunger for occasional solitude , that there were times when , out of the complicated and artificial life into which he had thrust her , it was necessary to disappear , to be alone for a time , in order to go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had moved from the house on Thirty-fourth Street to the great mausoleum next door to Mrs. Ogden , she had insisted that she have a bedroom of her own in order now and then to have a little solitude . He had gone on being hurt for the rest of his life , believing to the very end that she had demanded her own room because she had been offended by the discovery of one of his infidelities . He had never understoodwhy , after " the terrible summer , " she had firmly gone off to the Rockingham Hotel in Portsmouth , to stay for a time under a different name where she would see no one she knew . He could never understand that this was the only thing which made it possible to go on living after the deaths of Herbert and Eddie . The novel lay on the bed beside her , unopened , perhaps because the plot , the characters , the situations were all far less absorbing than the things she had lived through , the people she had known , the curious quality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment the mine had blown up and Gus had been trapped into marrying her ; for she knew now as she had known for nearly forty years that he had never meant to ask her to marry him . He had merely meant to take her for his mistress ; it was her own naivete and innocence which had trapped him , these things and perhaps his own desire and his gambler 's temperament which told him , " I might as well marry her as anyone else . Something can be made of her . " Gus himself had admitted it during the nasty business over Mrs. Ebbsworth at the beginning of " the terrible summer . " Then the door opened and nitric came in with the warm milk and some biscuits on a tray . Silently she crossed to the bedside table and put them down . " Thank you , Mattie , " said Mrs. Parkington , " That 's everything I 'll need . " But Mattie did n't go away . She stood there at the foot of the bed , respectfully but firmly , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go on , Mattie . Say it ! There 's something on your mind . There 's no use in our holding back anything from each other . " Mattie coughed and looked down at the footboard , " It 's about Mr. Amory , Mrs. Parkington . I 've been hearing some strange things . I thought maybe he had been troubling you . . . that wasp195why he was coming here . " Before Mrs. Parkington could answer , she said , " I 've thought you should go away somewhere  --  make a trip , maybe . " " It might be a good idea , Mattie , but I could n't go away yet .. , not until Mr. Stilham is out of his trouble . You see that , do n't you , Mattie ? " The servant considered this for a moment , " No , Mrs. Parkington , " she said , " I do n't . I 've lived with you for a long time now . I hope I can say we are friends . . . more than just servant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say . I 've lived with you for a long time and I 've seen you put upon by people all those years . I think you 've taken enough of that . You 've a right to have some peace . God knows you 've earned it . I do n't see why you have to stay and face Mr. Amory 's trouble . You did n't ask for it . You did n't do it . He 's no blood relation of yours . I do n't even think you like him . I think you ought to go away some-where . " Mrs. Parkington listened , trying to stop the tears that kept corning into her eyes . She knew that her eyes were misted because she was tired and because she felt , perhaps more than she had ever felt it , the depth of Mattie 's friendship and their closeness to each other . Mattie was an extraordinary woman ; it was even more extraordinary that a woman of such character had gone on for years putting up patiently with a willful woman like herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea ; it would be a good idea for Mattie as well as herself  --  Mattie who rarely went out of the house , even to take the air by walking round the block . Mattie had been getting into a rut , more and more lately . Mattie certainly deserved a change , but not now . " I like what you said about being friends , Mattie , " she said , " I think we do n't even need to talk about that . And I think going away is a good idea but I ca n't go until this trouble is straightened out . Did you ever think how many people are going to be upset by it . . . their whole lives upset . . . and they wo n't know what to do  --  not Janie or Mrs. Stilham or Jack or even Mr. Amory himself . They just are n't made that way . "  | Mattie was watching her with resentment in the clear blue eyes . She was n't being convinced . When she chose to be stubborn , Mattie could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , craftily , exercising that peculiar beguiling charm which had always been her greatest and ultimate weapon , she said to Mattie , " Come Mattie . Sit down here on the edge of the bed . " She was being unscrupulous because she did n't want Mattie to leave her in a resentful mood and because she could not help herself . Mattie , she knew , would not be deceived by what she was doing . Shc would see through it but she would like it . She knew her mistress so well that she would know she was being victimized and enjoy it ; sometimes Mattie could be very like a man . She came over and sat on the edge of the bed with a determined air of detachment and respect , so Mrs. Parkington had to go further . She reached out and took Mattie 's hand . At the touch , the elderly maid relaxed a little . " You sec , Mattie . There 's something I 've only figured out lately . It took a long time to discover it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . that some people are well provided by God with strength and common sense . In a way they 're the lucky ones . Most people are fools or afraid or they run away from things . They 're always coming to the well-provided people and unloadingtheir burdens . I 've conic to the conclusion that I must be one of the tough ones who can take very nearly anything . That 's the price I 've had to pay for the great things that God gave me . . . and He gave me a great deal . Do n't ever forget it . . . no matter what has happened to me in the past . You see , if someone like me runs away he 's ducking his job and if he ducks his job something happens to him ... something destructiveand evil happens . All the strength goes out of you if you 're that kind of person . If you go on doing it , you destroy yourself , because some kind of God-made or natural law operates like that . Do n't you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't be any rest for me ? I 'd be miserable all the time thinking about the thing 1 was running away from and worrying about what was happening to Janie and Jack and Mrs. Stilham and even Mr. Amory.  |p197Janie  and Jack are n't old enough yet to know how to behave if Mr. Amory should go to prison and neither he nor Mrs. Stilhamhave enough sense to know what to do . God or nature or something was ungenerous to them . It is n't their fault . I sha n't try to tell them what to do but they 'll come to me just the way they always have  --  all of them and a lot of others the minute they are in trouble . Because it 's a kind of law . It just works that way , You ca n't do anything about it . " Mattie was looking at the floor but she was listening . Mrs. Parkington knew it by the very stillness of Mattie 's plump fingers . When Mattie said nothing she continued , " And you must remember another thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people you get stronger and calloused and hard , and the older you get , the more people lean on you , the wiser you get . You get so that you can take almost anything . You get so that , as Janie says , you know all the answers . " She pressed Mattie 's hand and said , " You 're worrying about how this disgrace of Mr. Amory is going to affect me . I 'll tell you something , Mattie , I would n't tell anyone else I know . What happens to Mr. Amory does n't affect me at all . It 's just part of a story in which I 've lived for a long time  --  a story in which very little affects or shocks me any longer . It 's like something I 'm reading . . . something that exists at a great distance from me . None of it really touches me at all , but it touches Mrs. Stilham and the children terribly because they do n't know how to deal with it , and I could n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need someone to tell them what to do , to cheer them up , to give them a sense of perspective . Do you see what 1 mean , Mattie ? Do you understand ? You must , because you yourself are always having people coming to you . If you had n't been like that yourself , you would n't have given your sister the money to come to America when her husband was killed . You would n't have volunteered to pay for your cousin Helga 's baby when she got into trouble . You would n't be bothering to look after an old woman like me , worrying about whether I 'm tired or not . You would n't go up to Cook 's room every night to massage her back and look after that awful brat Hicks leaves with you on Thursdays when his wife has to visit her mother at the asylum . You know exactly what I mean , Mattie . Your body 's being tired does n't matter much . If you betray yourself then it 's much more than weariness ... it 's destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can I. God did n't ask us if we wanted the job . He just gave it to us  --  to both of us . You do see , Mattie , do n't you ? " For the first time Mattic looked at her . She pressed Mrs. Parkington'sthin hand and said , " Yes , Mrs. Parkington , I do . . . I 'm afraid I do . Sometimes I do n't think that it 's very fair of God . " " Sometimes I 've thought the same thing , Mattie . I used to think it a long time ago when so many terrible things happened to me . And then I began to see that in a way there was a plan in it all . . . it still seems a pretty muddled confused plan but it does seem that it works out to make life better for us . When it all adds up you and I have got something that the others never knew . We 've got a kind of love and respect from people that they never knew and never will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciences . When we die we 'll be willing to die because we 've had so much , we wo n't die feeling . . . well , unfinished . It 's a great thing that God gave the strong ones . Because God was so generous to us in making us strong , I can afford to say it now without seeming smug because I 've got a kind of detachment about things , even about myself . I would n't dream of saying any of these things to anyone else in the world . " She released Mattie 's hand , " As soon as all this is settled , you and I will go for a trip . Where would you like to go ? " Mattie blew her nose firmly and said , " There 's not very many places left . We ca n't go to Europe or the East . " " I 've got a kind of hankering to make a trip West , Mattie . You 've never really seen the West except from the train on the way to California . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't seen anything . " " I 'd like that , " said Mattie , simply . " We 'll go in the car and take Hicks along and we 'll stop at funny hotels and maybe at trailer camps and something they call by the silly name of Motels. "  |p199Mattie  rose heavily from the bed and Mrs. Parkington said , " There 's one thing I 'd like to ask you . Where did you hear all this about Mr. Amory ? " " Cook heard it from another cook at market . . . you know , that shop that sells pate de foie gras and such stuff . It was Mrs. Everett 's cook . " So that was it . Judge Everett had been talking in front of the servants at lunch . It was extraordinary how many things servants knew and how much they repeated . Well , very shortly it probably would not matter . Everyone would know about it . Before Mattie could pry further , she said , " I think I 'll go to sleep now , Mattie . Call me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " That 's very foolish , madame . You know you have the Symphony Board tomorrow and the Bellevue Guild and with having to see Mrs. Sanderson and this worrisome business about Mr. Amory ... " Mrs. Parkington interrupted the catalogue , " How am I to get all that done if I do n't get up early ? " " It 's too early , madame . " " It 's much less tiring to get up a little earlier than to have to hurry all day from one thing to another always being late . Besides , there was a time when I got up before daylight and helped get breakfast for thirty-eight men . " Mattie sniffed , " That , madame , was about seventy-five years ago . " " I still want to be called at seven forty-five , " said Mrs. Parkington . " Good night , Mattie . " " Good night , Mrs. Parkington . " She went out , closing the door very quietly behind her . Mrs. Parkington was glad that she had addressed her by her name instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone , Mrs. Parkington turned out the light , partly because she knew that Mattie would not go to sleep otherwisebut would return again and again to look for darkness instead of a thread of light beneath her door and partly because she knew that the talk with Mattie had roused a whole rush of200 MRS . PARKL.NGTONp200memories that would not permit her to read in any case . She would simply turn the pages without knowing what she was trying to read , because her memories were , in a way , more improbablethan the contents of most books . Somehow " the terrible summer " kept coming back to her thoughts . First Amory 's trouble and then the Duchess ' " illness " had revived it . It had been there , in the background of all the talk with Mattie . In the darkness , lying awake because she was too tired to sleep , " the terrible summer " came alive again , quietly like a very distantlandscape enveloped in a cold winter mist , and out of it she saw the figures of Norah Ebbsworth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lebanon at Oriander . It was the week the Prince had come down to stay . The Prince and Mrs. Kcppncr and the Baron Rothschild and Harry Haxton were with her on the terrace . They had been talking about a horse called Arrcau owned by Monsieur Blanc of Monte Carlo , which had just won the Grand Prix , and all the time she had been watching the figures of Norah Ebbsworth and Gus as they crossed the lawn , and hating Norah . It was n't that she was jealous of Norah ; she was n't really a jealous woman . It was simply that she hated Norah as Norah  --  as a well-born penniless , unscrupulous woman  --  a whore born in the midst of a world where everyone was privileged and protected , a whore without the decent qualitiesor the courage of a whore . Norah was tall and dark , with blue eyes and a fair skin , a beauty whose loveliness had been spoiled long ago by the hardness of the mouth and eyes . She was a good gambler and gay in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her that Norah was the only person in the world she had ever really hated because Norah was the only person she had ever known who seemed to her to be wholly evil . Norah was not content with the evil inside herself ; she sought to spread it by corrupting all about her . Itp20Iseemed to her now that with Norah began the degeneration of Gus 's taste in women . After that episode it had grown progressivelyworse until the sordid end in Cannes . Norah corrupted him as she had corrupted so many others . It was no satisfaction to know that she had died long ago , an old bitter woman , in squalor in a pension in Genoa . She still hated Norah Ebbsworth because she was Norah Ebbsworth , without warmth or generosityor kindliness . And while on the terrace they talked about Arreau , she was watching the pair coming across the lawn , with Norah , probably telling some vulgar , strong story , turning to Gus and laughing as they walked . And as they neared the terrace and saw the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm , waved to them and threw back her head and laughed . It was exactly as if she had cried out , " See ! I 've taken him away from Susie ! I 've got him ! He 's mine ! " And Susie could n't any longer hear the conversation about her . She rose quietly and slipped into the big Georgian house to go up to her room and sit there very stiffly upright on a chair , trying to think what she should do . There had been other women before Norah . She had come long ago to accept that , understanding that this was something Gus could not help because he was made like that , because there was so much of the animal in him that no one woman could ever keep him for herself . He just did n't fit into a tame , domestic scheme of things . She had come to believe , partly to salve the hurt to her own vanity , that what she did not know could not hurt her . But this business of Norah Ebbsworth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at her own table , before her eyes and in the presence of people staying with them . She rememberedGus 's saying once that no wise man ever had an affair with a woman who would by any chance ever sit at the same table with his wife . And now he had broken the rule . She did not hold it against him ; Norah , doubtless , had outmaneuvered him , and had come on the house party against his wishes.  |p202She  could fight back ; belowstairs , on the terrace , Harry Flaxtonwas only waiting for her to accept the proposals he was forever making ; but this she could not bring herself to do since the tactics of cheating in revenge had always seemed to her not only vulgar but foolish , all the more so since Harry seemed to her amusing and pleasant but no more than that . Sitting bolt upright she tried to reason coldly what she should do since it was clear that it was impossible to stay on in the same house with Norah flaunting her triumph , telling everyone by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had got what she wanted  --  the big good-looking , rich American . With Norah it was n't simplythe question of a week-end affair . With the evil there was in her , she would n't let it rest on that . She would want money .. more money . That was why she had set her trap for Gus . If he had n't been so rich the whole thing would never have happened . There were always women , hordes of them , in pursuit of Gus not only because he was big and attractive , but because he was rich and generous . In a way he was a victim but unfortunatelya victim who himself enjoyed thoroughly and with gusto the sacrifice . Luckily his pocket could afford it . For a time as she sat there in this strange , beautiful house which they had rented for the summer , she thought : Maybe it will be worse from now on . Maybe I should leave him now . Maybe I should go back to America and have my own life . Maybe it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always wanted . The boys are grown now and Herbert is married with two children of his own . I 'm only forty-three years old and I 'm still attractive . But she could not bring herself to go away . She thought : No , I can not go now , not until I 've beaten Norah . If it had been an ordinary woman , she would not have minded so much going off and leaving her with Gus . That sort of thing never lasted for long ; he always came back quickly . But Norah was different . Because she was evil she would follow him , trying to blackmail him . She would show him off wherever she went . Presently when she had pulled herself together she rang for her maid . The girl was Swedish , a well-trained girl , pretty too inp203a robust peasant fashion . Susie had grown very fond of her , but there was another stronger bond between them ; in all the world only Mattie knew what had happened in Salzburg . Only Mattie knew about those ten days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betrayed her by so much as a word or a look of understanding . She had behaved , always , as if she were unaware that anything had happened there . And now the sight of Mattie brought it all back again and cased a little the pain and humiliation of this other thing . There were times when it seemed to her that what had happened in those ten days was something which could never have happened to her , like something she had dreamed , but now suddenly the memory was very real and gave her a curious , deep satisfaction . It was something Gus had never known , something he never would know because she would never tell him . There was a kind of satisfaction in his not knowing . She could watch him across the table beside Norah and think : You are not the only one ! And now the Swedish maid was asking her what she would wear for dinner and when she suggested a simple dress , Mattie said , " If you will forgive me , madame , I 'd suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diamonds . " Susie turned to look at her , astonished that she should have made such a suggestion . The girl 's face was quite blank , so deliberatelyblank of all expression that Susie divined that she must know about Gus and Norah Ebbsworth . Mattie , she understood suddenly , was on her side but she was being discreet . She understood what it was Mattie wanted her to do . Shc wanted her to be brilliant and glittering and outshine Norah Ebbsworth which she could do , not only because she was clever enough but because she looked young enough to wear black and diamonds and still seem softer and younger than Norah with her hard mouth and eyes . So she said quietly , " Very well , Mattic , although it seems a little odd as a summer dress . " " There is no summer in England , madame , " said Mattie , " And in any case it is a large dinner and the Prince is here . Formality will flatter the Prince . "  |p204While  she was dressing Gus came in . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ st e and Mattie worked over her hair . Without looking at him directly , she could watch him . He said , " Well , sparrow . We missed you on the terrace . " He was pretending , she knew , trying to make himself believe that she did not know what was going on . " I came up to lie down for a time . I suddenly felt very tired . You had better dress . There 's not much time . " He bent over suddenly and kissed the back of her neck . Mattie stood aside stiffly in order to permit the caress . He took no notice of Mattie. 1 le had no shyness . Then he said , " I 'll be ready , " and went our . When he had gone Susie was aware that her heart was beating more rapidly and that the color had come into her face and she thought how handsome he was and what a remarkable man for fifty-six years . She was aware that the unexpected caress was not simply a spontaneous action . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I know I 'm in the wrong . I 'm ashamed too because Norah is a bitch . Forgive inc . She does not matter at all beside you . . . no one does , no one ever has or ever will . " The kiss somehow took all the strength , all the resentment out of her because it made her remember suddenly that night at the Brevoort before they went out to Dclmonico 's when , standing behind her , he had clasped the pearls about her throat and kissed her . The Swedish girl went on silently fixing the complicated waves and curls which were fashionable that year , and Susie knew that she could never leave him , and that what happened at Bad Gastein had been of no importance , however strange and wonderful it had seemed at the time . When she went downstairs to the big drawing-room , Harry was already there and she knew at once that he had come down earlier than the others expressly to talk to her . His presence made her nervous and unhappy . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , but she was aware that she could not help herself , for the kiss had roused all her old feeling for Gus and withp205Gus in her very blood , Harry 's good looks seemed pale and decadent and soft . He said , " You look dazzling tonight . " " Thank you . " She went about touching the flowers , loosening them , letting them breathe , and as she went from vase to vase , he said , " You have a hand of magic . " " Flowers must look like flowers , not like funeral offerings . " She knew he was watching her . She never doubted that he knew all about Gus and Norah . There was something feminine about Harry which made him a gossip , an intriguer and a very fine minor poet . He knew things before they happened . He said suddenly , " I ca n't bear to see you hurt , Susie . " She knew it was stupid to say , " What makes you think I 'm hurt ? " It would not deceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . " Norah is a foul bitch . I have scores of my own to settle with her . " " It does n't matter , " she said , " Gus belongs to me , really . He 's like that . But it does n't mean anything . " " I 'm going to get married . " She had redone the last of the flowers and she turned toward him to say , " I 'm very glad . I think it 's much better that way . " " I 've told no one yet . " " Who is the girl ? " " I doubt that you know her . She 's young and she 's very rich and I think she likes me . Her father is a rich builder , one of the richest in London . " " So it 's that kind of a match ? " " Yes . You would n't be hurting her . She 'd never know anything about it . It 's rather our last chance , Susie . You 'll be going back to America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked out of the window . " You 've never believed how much I really love you . You 'll never believe it because I can ' make you believe it . I do n't know how . But you are a woman , what a woman , my dear . If nothing ever happens between us , I 'll die feeling that I 've missed what is the most wonderful thing that could ever have happened to me. "  | " Thank you , Harry . " " I could arrange it . I could arrange to leave Gus with Norah when you came to stay with me . " She thought : Now is my chance if I wanted revenge on Gus . But she still did not want such a thing . She took Harry 's hand and said , " It would n't be any good , Harry . It would only be a disappointment to you and it would violate something in me . I 'm very fond of you but not that much . I 'm not like Norah and so many other women over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like shaking hands . The answer my dear is no . ' You get married to your rich young girl . It 's much better that way . " Still no one came down the great stairway . He looked away from her and said , " It 's odd how your saying no ' makes you all the more desirable . I 'm not used to women like you . Very few women have ever said no ' to me . " He walked over to the window and said " You 'd be something to win and possess and keep . I think I 've always known that since the beginning . If ever there is anything I can do for you , even the least thing , you have only to ask me . I know that sounds like bad Tennyson , and consequentlyto say it , costs me more than you can ever know , but it 's true . " Chen he turned toward her again . " I 'll never speak of it again but there 's one thing for you to remember  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die . " She started to speak but found no words with which to answer him and after a moment he said , " You must get Gus away from Norah . She is a cheat and a blackmailer . " With a curious pride she answered , " She 'll have to be very clever to cope with Gus . " Then the Baron came downstairs and Lady Woolsey and from the drive outside the window carne the coughing explosions of Lord Hinchcombe 's deLaunay-Belleville , and suddenly the room was filled with people  --  all the brilliant , fashionable people the world read about and envied and admired and hated and imitated . It was a world that was theatrical and witty and gay and above all secure but it had never brought Susie any happiness . At dinner she sat on the right of the Prince with Harry on the other side . Deliberately she had put Norah beside Gus . Norahp207wore a bright poison green dress cut very low but Susie saw that the dress was a mistake . Choosing it was the gesture of a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem harder . While Susie talked to Harry or the Prince she used unscrupulously that softnessand charm which she had learned to summon up when she was tired or determined to gain something she wanted . The Prince was very fond of her and she knew that the fondness or even the sometimes frank manifestations of it did not alarm Gus , but it annoyed the snob in Norah , that special sort of snobbishnessthat was peculiar to England . To be " on the inside with the Prince "  --  to be called by him " Norah " instead of merely being called " Mrs. Ebbsworth "  --  she would gladly have given up Gus . Each time the Prince addressed her as " Susie " she knew that it was like the thrust of a knife in Norah 's back . Susie was shrewd enough to know all that . She hated Norah because Norah was evil . For Norah she felt no mercy . The scene happened in the card room just after the men had joined the ladies . It was a cool evening and around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norah , Lord Hinchcombe , the Baron , Mrs. Keppner and Mrs. Pulsifer , the American wife of a London banker , waiting for the Prince to give the word for starting the poker . He already sat at the table laying out cards and playing patience while he talked to Gus about some American investments . Susie had just finished giving orders to the butler and was closing one of the tall windows giving on to the terrace when she heard Harry saying , " It will be warmer in Biarritz . It 's lovely there now and the Prince is very fond of it . He was delighted with the idea . " " Who 's going ? " Norah asked boldly . " All the men , " said Harry , " And Susie and Anne perhaps . " " What about me ? " " No , my dear , you 're not going . This holiday is to be a rest . The party includes only quiet sensitive people . " There was a little edge of mockery in Harry 's voice which Susie knew very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she had seen the mockery grow and sometimes turn into something terrible . It always meant that Harry was laying a trap forp208someone . The very timbre of his voice should have warned Norah . As soon as she heard Norah speak again , she knew that Norah had fallen into the trap . She turned away and took down a book of sporting prints from the shelf near her and pretended to be looking for some special print ; actually she did not see the book at all for she was listening , straining every nerve to hear . Norah said , " That 's very rude of you , Harry . I 'd no intention of going in any case . " " I did n't mean to be rude . Only a precaution , Norah . You 're a disrupting influence wherever you turn up . " Then Norah said , " I doubt that Gus will want to go . He 's planning to go to Southampton yachting . " She heard again Harry 's cold , level voice , " As a matter of fact it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He proposed it . ' When Norah spoke again there was fury in her voice . Harry was making an exhibition of her , showing everyone in the group about the fire that she did not in the least possess Gus , giving the lie to all her actions , all the bold implications that he was hers . Susie waited , her heart beating rapidly . " I 'm surprised that you wanted Gus . I should think he would be in the way . " With her back to them , still turning the pages of the book Susie thought , " It 's going to happen . She is a fool to lose her temper . " For the first time she understood a little how desperate Norah was , how necessary it was for her to keep possession of Gus . For a second Susie almost felt pity for her . " I 've no idea what you mean by that , " said Harry . The Baron said , " Norah thinks you 're trying to cut her out of something . " " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you want to know what I think , I 'm surprised that Harry and Susie do n't want to keep Gus out of the picture . " Then Susie heard Gus 's voice and the moment she heard it she knew that the quick ferocious temper had flared up . She wanted to check him but she still had to pretend that she was absorbed in the book and had heard nothing . P209Gus said , " What did you mean by that , Norah ? " Susie knew without turning how he looked , the face crimson , the vein in the forehead throbbing . Norah was a fool not to be frightened , but there was in her the sluttish hardness of a pub prostitute . She said coldly , " Only what everybody knows already . " Then Susie could no longer resist looking . As she turned , she saw that Gus , in his anger , had left the table where he had been talking to the Prince . The Prince had stopped playing his absentmindedgame of patience.He held the pack of cards in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gus stood in front of Norah now . He was shaking and for a moment quite incapable of speech . Susie heard herself calling out , " Gus ! Please ! Gus ! " Gus without turning to her said , " Leave this to me . " And then to Norah , he said , " What you implied about my wife is untrue . Admit now that it is untrue . " Norah 's mouth , painted in a day when paint was not common on women , was hard and ugly . She said , " You 're a fool , Gus , if you do n't believe it . " Then an extraordinary thing happened . The Prince rose and said , " Never mind , Gus . No one believes it . No one could believe anything but good of Susie . " Gus recovered his temper with that suddenness which accompaniedits ferocity . He said , " I beg your pardon , sir , for making a scene in my own house and in your presence . " " If there is an apology owing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to Susie . " Then he turned to Norah and said , " I think Mrs. Ebbsworth must be overtired . It might be a good idea for her to go up to her room and rest before going back to London . " The humiliation was complete . Nothing remained for Norah but to leave . She began to speak and then thought better of it and turning quickly , she walked the length of the card room and out of the door . She had lost both Gus and the favor of the Prince . Never again would she be invited to any house in which he was present . Susie , standing there , humiliated but triumphant , knew that itP210was not possible to follow Norah . It was not possible even to see her again before she left the house . The Prince said , " Come . Let 's get on with the poker , " and seated himself at the table . When they were all seated Susie went to Anne Pulsifer and asked her to go up and speak to Norah and discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Harry , " Thank you . " Harry said , " There is no sluttishness like that of an English slut who should know better . " Then he turned quickly to the game and Susie went to stand by the fireplace , looking into the fire , filled with a sudden happinessthat frightened her . Gus did not conic to her room that night although she lay awake for a long time hoping he would come . There were times when he had sudden surprising flashes of tact and fine feelings and she knew that he had gone directly to his own room because it would have seemed both vulgar and sloppy to have staged a great reconciliation immediately after the scene with Norah . Susie knew that it was all over . Very likely Gus would never speak of the scene ; probably lie would never again speak Norah 's name . I le was like that . When Mattis came in she said , " I have a message for you , madame . The housekeeper said to tell you that Mrs. Ebbsworth had been called up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . " While Mattie helped her undress , Susie said suddenly , " Do they know in the servant 's room what happened in the card room ? " " Yes , " said the girl , " They know something about it . There was quite a quarrel over it between the housekeeper and Mrs. Ebbsworth 's maid . " " You must n't speak of it outside , Mattie . It 's the kind of story that will go everywhere once it 's started . You must n't speak of it because of His Royal Highness . " " Of course , madame , " said Mattie , " I would n't think of telling it about . " " I 'll speak to the housekeeper and the others in the morning . " P211Susie got into bed , and it was only after the clothes had been put away and the dressing-room in order that Mattie spoke again . She asked , " Is there anything more I can do for you ? " " No , Mattie , thank you . Good night . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a success . I was sure the black dress was the one to wear . " It was the first time Mattie had ever " presumed "  --  the first of what were to be countless times . She closed the door before Susie could answer , but she left her mistress smiling in the darkness . It was good to have friends like Harry and the Prince and Mattie . When she opened her eyes the room was full of morning light and Gus was standing beside the bed . Like all alert people , Susie wakened suddenly , and she knew almost at once that something terrible had happened . She knew by the look in Gus 's eyes and by the touch of his hand , stroking her hair , very quietly . In his other hand he held a bit of paper which she recognized at once as a telegraph form . Gus said , " Take it easy , sparrow . Take your time . Wake up . " She was awake as she always was on opening her eyes , and she asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad . " He sat down on the edge of the bed , stopped stroking her hair and took her hand . " It 's bad news , " he said , " About Herbert . " She knew by his voice what he was feeling and she knew too that the news was the worst possible . She said what immediately came into her mind , " It could n't be Herbert " . . . not Herbert , her bright , shining Herbert , the boy in the pram , whom everyone stopped to admire . People like Herbert could n't die young . They brought too much into the world . Their beauty and charm were too great to be wasted or destroyed . " It is Herbert , " said Gus , quietly . " There was an accident on the road from Newport to Narragansett . The automobile got out of control and went off a bridge . " She only thought : That damned automobile ! I never wanted him to buy one until they made better ones . That damned automobile ! She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing at all . Gus said , " Aspasie sent the cable . It 's a long one . She has toldP212everything . I think the funeral will be on Thursday . There will be a memorial service when we get home . " But Susie 's mind had already leapt far beyond such things as funerals and memorial services . Herbert was dead . She said , " Those poor children with no one to bring them up but that crazy Blair girl ! " " Yes , " said Gus , " that 's bad . " Then he leaned down and put his arm about her and said , " Cry , sparrow ! Go on . Cry ! I 'll hold you . I 'll take care of you . " And then the tears came , in a wild rush , not so much then at the death of Herbert as at the sudden tenderness of Gus . The tears for Herbert would come later . They would always be there in her heart until she died . It was curious how Aspasie was always at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was an efficiency about Aspasie , a human efficiency , which few Americans understood . Americans , who thought of efficiency in terms of machinery , said the French were inefficient , and consequently few of them understood people like Aspasie whose life was founded upon common sense and eternal human values . And there was in Aspasie the formalism of the French which , like that of the Chinese , clothed naked human relationships with the cloak of civilization . The Chinese hire mourners who wail and cry at the head of a funeral processionin order that the bereaved need not beat his breast in public , calling out upon all to witness his grief . When one is born or dies or is married both the French and the Chinese have a printed card or a formal phrase of congratulations or condolence which takes care of the situation and permits people who are not especiallyinterested one way or another to get on to other and more interesting subjects of conversation . By formalism they have encouraged sincerity . It was all part of an efficiency , Mrs. Parkingtonoften @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water closets and automobiles . Aspasie was like that . In a time of calamity or tragedy she wasP213always on hand , quiet , sympathetic , knowing the thing to be done and doing it perfectly , with taste and without ostentation . She did not take possession of the injured or the . bereaved , exploitinghim to demonstrate publicly her own sympathy and greatness of spirit . She simply went to work doing the dull , painful things which had to be done . As Mrs. Parkington grew older she came to understand that only two women in her life had been very close to her , only two whom she loved and understood so well that communication between them and herself was rarely necessary . The two women were her maid and a woman who had once been her husband 's mistress . Even in that role Aspasie was wonderfully and humanly efficient . Whatever there had been between herself and the Major was ended when he married Susie and the new relationship was begun upon a new basis . There remained no sloppy tags and ends of sentimentality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was ended was ended ; in it there had been happiness for which Aspasie was grateful , knowing that there is very little perfect happiness placed at the disposal of the poor human race . Despite the scene in which she had given so pictorial a performancein the red and gold sitting-room at the Brevoort , she did not see any reason why the past should slay her friendship with a woman like young Susie Parkington for whom she felt affection and respect . Her heart had not been in the scene because she had believed none of the conventional speeches she made nor the conventions upon which they were founded . This was very French ; it was also very civilized . Because of it the Major respected her more than any woman in the world except his own wife , and there were even times when of the two Aspasie seemed to be the more practical and sensible . Long after that scene between the two women , Susie often considered how much of intelligence , of guidance , of understandmg , or richness , she would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool and said , " No , since you were my husband 's mistress , we must never again see each other . " She had not the human efficiency of Aspasie , nor the background of deep civilized wis/dom , but she had a sound instinct which she trusted and LeapingRock had spared her the sentimentality she might have acquired in a half-civilized community . At one end of her experiencelay Leaping Rock , an utterly barbaric community , rooted in harsh reality ; at the other end stood Aspasie , a monument to complete civilization . Both were good ; the bad half-civilized ground between them she had never trod , in all her existence . For that she was grateful . So it was Aspasie , very smart in dark clothes , more handsome at sixty than she had been at twenty , who met them at the pier . Everything had been arranged by her . The house was open and the servants expecting them . " There were no newspaper men because Aspasic had given them a performance which so distractedand enchanted them that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed and was settled in his own house . The memorial service at St. Bart 's had been arranged . She did not rush forward gushing tears , crying out , " My poor darling Susie ! " There was a swift perfunctory kiss on the cheek , a pressure of the hand , and she began brightly asking about the voyage , telling bits of gossip , arranging with the Major 's secretary , Mr. Billingsley , concerning what was to be done with the luggage . What she said without saying it was , " This is something so deep one must not talk of it now . That will come later on . Now , the immediate thing is to go on living , picking up the small threads . That alone will help the pain and bring back the knowledge that there is tragedy in life which we must endure and put into its proper place in the scheme of things , into that perspective from which one will see it much later in life . In all things , in all human experience , even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied , lest it turn into a cancer which devours you . " And so when in that same " terrible summer " the news came that Alice could no longer endure the humiliation of her marriage and had asked for a divorce , it was Aspasie who said , " Dear Susie , I think I should go with you to Paris . There are things about the French that I know which you could not possibly know . " It was n't possible for the Major to leave but he and young Eddiep215cafne to the boat with Susie and Mattie and Aspasie . The Major was efficient in the grand manner , committing them to the care of an American international lawyer in Paris named Bates who was a friend of his . On the dock , she took Eddie aside and said , " Try and take it easy , Eddie . You do n't look well . You 've lost weight . Try not to stay up all night . Try to drink less . " She said nothing about women because she knew that it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his lip stubbornly . And it was women who troubled her most . He looked at her , grinning , and said , " Sure , Ma . I 'll slow down . I promise it . I 'm going out to the mines in the fall . I 'm only having a good time until I go . Out there I 'm not expecting much fun . " She could understand why he was so successful with women . There was something engaging and boyish about his red hair and freckles and blue eyes but really there was n't anything boyish in him . He was too precocious and knowledgeable ; in his tough young body was all the violence , the vitality , the capacity for desire , which was in all the Parkingtons , but with Eddie there was no direction but that of his own pleasure . It was n't often that a woman found in a young man all these things , along with money , all the money of Eddie 's father , money which he gave his son with a lavish extravagant generosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eddie or give him good advice . Gus , whose own youth had been both wild and hard , thought a young man should sow his wild oats . Iie found a kind of pride in the fact that his son should be keeping a show girl as beautiful , as famous , as Shirley Seagram ; at his son 's age , Gus had been courting waitresses . If it had only been Shirley , Susie would n't have minded so much but there were others too . It was n't something you could discuss with Eddie ; Susie would have discussed it if the choice had been left to her alone , but she knew that neither Gus nor Eddie would have tolerated it . To them it was a subject a wife and a mother never spoke of ; it was somethingconcerning which a good woman should remain in ignorance , or at least in the pretense of ignorance.  |p216The  two men , husband and son , stood on the pier until the big ship had slipped away into the river , waving their straw hats until they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Susie felt a pang at leaving them and a pride that two such splendid specimens belonged to her . As the evening closed down on the ship , she walked round and round the deck , arm in arm , in silence with Aspasie , trying to fight off the depression that settled over her as America slipped away behind the ship into darkness . It was a depression filled with selfreproachand a belief that she had failed as a mother . She was on her way to Paris to see through the divorce of a daughter whose marriage was a failure . One son had made a foolish marriage and been killed , leaving behind two little girls , and the other , for all his charm and good looks , was only a wastrel . In the thickening darkness , she tried to discover where she had failed . She had been as good a mother , as wise a mother as it was possible for her to lie , yet somehow it had come to nothing because outside the realm of her influence , where she herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pulling forever against her . There was ( his himself with his wild generosity and egotism and pride in his own wife and in his children , and Mrs. Ogden , and the huge fortune and the great houses in Newport and New York and the yacht and the newspaper reporters whom Gus was forever encouraging . The very schools to which Gus had insisted on sending the children had ruined them by their peculiar vulgar snobbery and emphasis on wealth , on family , on importance . In spite of anything she could do , the schools had implanted , in the two boys , at least a sense of being possessed of some special privilege , of being outside the rules which governed the conduct of ordinary people . Neither Eddie nor Herbert had , thank God , been snobs ; there was too much vigor , too much Parkington in them , but they believed they belonged to a world especially blessed and privileged . In a way , that was the hidden result if not the purpose of St. Bart 's and schools like it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these things had conspired to defeat her  --  these things and that curious passion for Gus which always softened her andP217made her yield to him and his ideas against her instinct and judgment . It seemed to her that there had been a time when , if she had asserted herself , she could have changed the whole course of their lives . It was during the summer in the little red house at Long Branch after the awful business of the ball . She could have fought then to go on living as they had lived that summer , quietly and well and above all , simply . Then the children would have had a chance . She could have kept them outside all the forces which had in some slow and mysterious fashion , deformed their lives . But when she went on thinking , reproaching herself , she knew that such a course had been impossible so long as she was married to Gus , because a quiet , respectable life would have been insupportableto him . He had to take everything he possessed , even his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or leave them behind forever . Gus had wanted what he had got ; he was pleased with it . After the first shock it seemed to her that he had forgotten even I lerbert 's death . He did not live in the past , but only in the presentand future . What was gone was gone . She did not doubt how deeply he loved her but neither had she any illusions as to what would happen if she died . For a little while he would grieve , but only for a little while , and then there would be another woman and after a little while he would never think of her at all unless by chance he saw her picture or someone spoke of her . Gus was always a kind of wonder to her ; he was a natural man , perhaps therefore a lucky and happy one . Gus was perhaps what nature intended man to be  --  a creator , a breeder , violent and healthy and unreflective . It seemed to her at times dint man had complicated and deformed his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And she knew that as soon as Gus and Eddie left the pier , they would go together , father and son , to Dclmonico 's or Rector 's to cat and drink well and meet a couple of girls , Shirley Seagram perhaps and a friend , and at the end of the evening Gus would perhaps be faithful to her and perhaps he would not . The odd thing was that somewhere , in some remote part of her being , she loved them both for loving life so much . in some remote part of her there was a little envy of them because they were menp218and full of the enjoyment of life . In Bad Gastein she had understoodthem . In some strange fashion it made her love them all the more . Then the ship passed from the harbor into the open sea and the wind came up sweeping the open deck and screaming through the rigging and Aspasie who perhaps divined what she had been thinking and so kept silent said , " We had better go and dress for dinner . It will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frenchwoman speaking again , drawing her back into the frame of everyday existence which made life in times of disaster endurable . Alice had left the Duke 's great house in the Rue de Varenne for the Hotel Mcuriec . It was a famous house designed by Gabriel with a great garden at the hack . At the time of the marriage , the great house stood empty for , bit by bit , the Duke and the Duke 's father had sold the furniture and sculpture and pictures and tapestrydeposited there generation after generation by the descendantsof the first I ) uc dc Brantes , peer of France and treasurer of Francis the First . The house was restored now with the money Major Parkington had made out of railroads and mines and oil in a country discovered about the time the first Duc de Brantes received his title . But its splendor held no attraction for the Major 's daughter . There was in her , as Susie well knew , a streak of commonness which rendered her uneasy in the presence of splendor . There was in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of the flair of Susie for living up to a situation , of acting as she had acted in response to Aspasie 's performancein the Brevoort long ago . Alice merely remained awkwardand uneasy . Only bitterness and disillusionment and long habit of worldly associations gave her , late in life , a kind of brittle poise and a kind of malice and wit . In the year she divorced the Duke she was merely an awkward , stubborn and provincial young woman who surprisingly spoke the classic French of the Theatre Francais taught her as a child by Aspasiep219It was this rather dreary young woman , dressed in expensive clothes by Worth which she wore badly , who met Susie and Aspasie at the Gare du Nord . She had the air of a bedraggled , beaten puppy . Her pleasure and excitement at seeing her mother and Aspasie was more unbearable than the misery in the eyes . Remembering what Aspasie had said on the day of the wedding  --  that Alice might as well go through with the marriage since if she did not marry the Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Perhaps it would be better for her to stay married to the Duke no matter how bad it was . But almost at once she saw the weakness of that idea . She was assuming that Alice was like herself  --  that she had resources and could build up a life of her own outside the realm of her husband 's existence . Alice was not clever and resourceful ; she was dull and dependent and without initiative . And the story was much worse , when she heard it , than anything she had imagined . At the end of the summer , the Meurice was filled with Americansand English , buying clothes , returning from summer holidays or on their way to Austria or Hungary for grouse and pheasant shooting . It was filled with people whom Susie knew . They were everywhere , in the great halls , in the restaurant and in the lift and Susie saw at once that it was impossible to think of staying on there in circumstances so humiliating . In the taxicab Alice had said , " He has decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what that meant  --  dirty linen , recriminations , all the horrors of a scandal in an age and a country where a divorce scandal was more than a scandal of any other sort could possibly be . Susie had asked , " Are you still determined to go through with it ? " and Alice answered with an astonishing intensity of feeling , " I want to be free of him ! I have to be ! 1 will never feel clean again if the whole thing is not finished completely ! " Across Alice , Susie 's eyes met Aspasie 's black ones . It was worse than either of them had ever expected . In the hotel sitting-room Aspasie , once they were settled and Mattie had the unpacking under way , said that she was going out to look up some old friends and relatives . She would not return until after dinner . There were friends and relatives and Aspasie220 MRS . PAI KINGTONP220meant to see them , but that was not the reason she went out . Susie discovered afterward that she went out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a kind of scouting trip . She went out to purchase all the newspapers , the gossip papers , the revues mondaines to discover the state of mind of Paris itself  --  French Paris as well as international Paris . When Aspasie had gone , Susie ordered lunch and while she and Alice ate , Susie talked of things at home , trying to establish a casual feeling which would permit Alice to tell her all tha was clearly shut up in her heart . She was not very successfu. for she felt between them almost at once that curious undefeatable strangeness which had obscured , like a fog , the relationship between them since the time Alice was old enough to talk . It was as if they were no relation to each other , as if Alice were foundlingof some strange blood . Sinfully and filled with shame , Susie sometimes thought : If she had been pretty and gay and amusing , it would have been different . How much I would have enjoyed that kind of daughter . Because this was not so , Susie had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscientiously straining to establish something which could not be established ; the effort perversely only heightened the sense of strangeness . Halfway through the lunch , it became slowly evident to Susie that Alice had become even more remote and difficult to reach She sat there , sallow-faced and plain , her eyes dark with misery and hurt pride , wanting sympathy and kindliness but thrusting it away the moment it was offered . It was the misery of a person whose whole world was encompassed by her own ego . If the weather was bad , the fact was of importance only in its effect upon herself . It was the misery of a person destined always to sufferbecause she remained enclosed in a shell , shutting out all sympathy , giving out nothing , uninterested in anything beyond the limits of her own self-imposed and gloomy prison . It was in a strange way the fierce egotism of Gus himself , inverted and devouring not other people but itself . Watching her , Susie thought shamefully that it was a strange and bitter world  --  that if one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been Alice , who found so little pleasure in life . rather than Herbert , bright HerP221bert , who loved life so passionately and gave back more than he received from it . She sighed and looked at the dusty tops of the chestnut trees in the Tuileries gardens . This Paris , dominated by the disaster of Alice , seemed a strange , gray city , cold and unfamiliar . Even the station and the streets did not look the same , but dimmed and misted over by the fog of Alice 's private misery . When the waiter came , Susie ordered champagne with the dessert , hoping wildly that somehow it would release the sense of strain and permit Alice to talk . But Alice only refused it , sayingsomething about her liver  --  an organ which Susie thought it unnecessary and unattractive to mention save in the presence of one 's doctor . Then unexpectedly , when the waiter had taken away the table and Susie stood looking out of the window into the Rue de Rivoli , it happened . Alice began to cry , silently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she began to talk ; the whole story , shut up for so long deep inside her lonely spirit , poured forth now ' without check , like water from a shattered dam . Susie , standing by the window , turned for a moment toward her and then thought : No , I must not look at her . I must not touch her ! If I try to console her , it will spoil everything ! So she turned away again and with a casual air of listening absent-mindedly as she watched the street , she heard the whole of the sordid story , never once interrupting Alice , but saying " Yes " now and then or murmuringsome indistinguishable phrase so that Alice would believe that she was hearing it all and continue to unburden what clearly had to be told if she was to save her sanity . Without being toid , Susie knew the girl had kept the whole story locked up inside herself , telling nothing beyond the simple record of the Duke 's infidelities , even to her lawyer. it was a dreadful story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which she was certain Alice herself did not understand , a story of humiliation both public and private , a story of mistresses and obscure debauchery . Much that Alice told innocentlyfitted together with Susie 's knowledge and experience into a pattern of perversity and vice . What Alice knew was badP222enough ; what she did not suspect was far worse . The Duke had not lived with her for more than two years . Quite openly he had shown all Paris that in fact she was no longer his wife and that he felt only contempt for her . Susie , listening to the end , was aware that ehe had always known what the end wound be ; she hat hoped that somehow Alice could defend herself ) r at least build a life independently , of her own . But she knew now , as the had known in her heart all along , that this was a vain hope . The strength was not in Alice ; poor Alice who would always be dependent upon men , would never be able either to hold them or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly even than she feared . And as she listened , she realized how helpless the girl was  --  that she had really learned nothing at all since she had left home on the day of her marriage . She had gained nothing from experience , nor was it possible to explain or teach her anything . It was as if she were determined to be miserable , and found a kind of perverse satisfaction in it , the satisfaction denied her elsewhere in life . The story finished at last in a burst of hysterical sobbing . Then Susie crossed the room and sat beside her daughter and drew the shaking body of the girl against her . She said very quietly and in a matter of fact way , " From now on you must leave the whole thing to Aspasie and me . You must try not to think of it any more . Are you certain that he means to fight the divorce ? " " He has it all planned . He has even worked out evidence to show that I have been unfaithful . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have you ? " Alice looked at her in astonishment . " No . Of course I have n't . I have had friendships with one or two men who were kind to me . That is all . " " You have n't been indiscreet ? " " I do n't know . I am not a lawyer . " It was clear enough that Alice would not know what indiscretionmight mean to a lawyer or a court . It was quire clear that she was altogether helpless in a strange country whose laws wereMRS . PARKINOTON 223P223very strange and different from those of America . Susie thought : It 's all Gus 's fault in a way . . . Gus 's wild generosity and his passion for doing everything in a big way . . . as if to advertise is success and his wealth . If he had not settled so much money on the Duke , the Duke would not have dared to threaten a countersuit . They might , of course , still be able to buy him off , but that was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of profoundand bitter outrage , very like the outrage she felt at the behavior of Norah Ebbsworth . The story Alice had just told her was impregnated with evil , with deliberate cruelty and perversity , and these were things which Susie had never been able to tolerate . Now she would not try to buy off the Duke , she would do it only as a last resort . She had a better plan , but before she acted she needed the advice of Aspasie . She said to Alice , " You had better lie down now . I 'll get tickets for the theater and when Aspasie comes in we 'll make arrangements to take a flat or a small house . It 's quite impossible for us to stay in any hotel at this time of year . There are too many peopleabout we know . Go now and rest and leave the whole thing to Aspasie and me . " Then suddenly , for the first time in all their lives together , A lice kissed her spontaneously and with feeling , so much feeling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost of madness . She said , " You do n't know how much difference it makes to have you here . It 's changed everything . I feel now as if I was n't completely alone any longer . I can trust everything to you . " It was the first time there was understanding between them , the first occasion on which the sense of strain between them was broken . It would take a long time for them to understand each other completely ; the understanding would not be complete until Alice herself was an old woman . At teatime Aspasie unexpectedly returned burdened with newspapersand periodicals , reporting that the whole thing was worseP224than she had feared . The divorce was the talk of Paris ; every revue mondaine had references to it . Some took the side of the young American woman against the dissolute Duke ; others said that she had got her just desert for buying her way into an ancient French family . But it did not rest there ; imaginative and blackmailingjournalists wrote dark intimations of orgies , of Lesbianism , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce found its way even into serious and solemn political newspapers ; the conservative ones cited it as an example of the evil results of the breaking down of old traditions ; the Roman Catholic papers attacked it as an example of the evils of Catholic-Protestant marriages ; the radicals used it as a brilliant example of the evils of wealth and capitalism . It was clear that Paris had had no such scandal since the accusation and suicide of the Duc de Praslins . Together Susie and Aspasic went drearily over the whole sheaf of papers , Aspasie ashamed of her own people for the peculiar vicious pettiness of the journals , Susie astonished by the notoriety which a person so dull and unspectacular as Alice had somehow managed to achieve . The odd thing was that Alice seemed unaware of the attacks ; it was as if , buried in her own personal misery , she were utterly indifferent to the opinion of a world in which she had at best played a small , pale role . When they had finished with the journals , the two women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Aspasie , " The French can be at the same time the most elevated and vulgar of people . " Susie did not mind so much the French journals ; she was aware that Alice 's life in France was ended , that Alice felt no regrets at the fact . It was the American papers she feared , the awful , sensational Sunday supplements and their stories about " Another American girl who bought a title . " For a moment she wished that the Major was in Paris to deal with the situation , but after a little reflection , she realized that nothing could be worse than the presence of Gus ; he would grow furious and contemptuous and violentand only make everything far worse . This was a thing for herself and Aspasie to handle . There was no theater that night . Alice did not even waken atP225the hour for dinner and Susie did not wake her . It was as if the release of telling the whole story to her mother had brought the first relaxation she had known in many months , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that time . Susie and Aspasic dined in the sitting-room and after dinner they laid their plans for action . It included the spending of much money , the use of unscrupulous people , much knowledge of the world in all its aspects , not a little blackmail and above all , promptness of action . There was , they decided , not a moment to be lost . Tomorrow Susie would see all the lawyers in the case and Aspasie would find a house or a flat and engage four or five privatedetectives , as unscrupulous as she could possibly find . It would be simple enough to find them , they were everywhere in Paris . Most difficult of all was the task of Susie herself ; it was necessary for her to arrange a meeting with the Duke . In all of it Alice must be kept quiet and out of the picture . And so the two women set to work . The flat was easy to find and after Susie had interviewed Alice 's lawyers she understood at once that very little was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and respectable and more concerned with their position at the Traveler 's Club and at the embassy than with fighting for their client ; it was clear almost at once that they wished , but for the huge fee they expected to receive , that they had never become involved in so scandalous a case . Their French partners , nice , elderly and funereally respectable , were no more than bookkeepers ; both were listed in the telephone directory not only as avocats but as hommes de lettres . The detectives were much more what Susie needed . One of them looked like a fashionable undertaker and kept dry-washing his hands throughout the first interview as if he had some stain upon his soul from which he was unable to cleanse himself . The other was a short , dark man with a brutal face and a tic . One vas named Monsieur Blanc , a perfectly innocuous name , and the other , the undertaker , was called Monsieur de Trevillac , a noble enough Breton name concerning the falseness of which neither Aspasie nor Susie had any illusions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desired . As their business caused them to spend a great deal of time among the more vicious elements of the Paris underworld , they already had , they said , a considerable dossier on the Duke . One collected such things and filed them . One never knew when they might be of use . When they brought what impromptu things they had already collected so casually , Susie and Aspasic went over the whole record with them and Susie concluded that already she had all she needed for her purpose . When they had gone , bowing their way backward out of the drawing-room , Susie sat down with the aid of Aspasie to write a letter to the Dunce requesting an interview . They sent it by messenger and the answer came by messenger . The Duke would be delighted to see his mother-in-law again , nothing would give him greater pleasure , but he could not possiblyaccept her proposal to call upon him ; it was his duty and correctness demanded that he call upon her . It was for her to set the time . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , not the moment for suavity , not the time for flattery . He arrived at four on the following afternoon . Susie was alone in the flat . She had wanted Alice out of the way but there was another more important reason ; she meant to do something which was shameful to her , which violated profoundly her whole nature . It would he difficult enough to do it alone face to face with her son-in-law ; she could not possibly achieve what she meant to achieve in the presence of a third person , even Aspasie who knew all the details of the plan . When she came into the drawing-room of the flat she had taken in the Rue Tilsit , he was standing at the window looking down into the street . He did not hear her come in and she stood for a moment in the doorway , the awful dossier furnished by Monsieur Blanc and Monsieur dc Trevillac , under her arm . When she spoke she did not call him " Jacques " nor even address him as " my son-in-law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ le Duc . " There was both mockery and insult in what she did.  |p227But  . is soon as he turned and she saw his face , she felt her bitternessweakened by something which was beyond her control as a woman ; he was a very attractive man , as dissolute men can sometimesbe . It was as if his mere presence , his mere mocking , flatteringsmile broke down barriers of resistance , of moral principle . It was not the overwhelming physical attraction of a man like the Major ; this one 's charm was more insinuating and evil , more destructive , as if inviting you , seducing you  --  the charm of a goodlookingand utterly abandoned man who stopped at nothing . He crossed the room and kissed her hand , saying , " I am delighted to see you again , belle-mere . It is not flattery when I say that you are one of the women I am always eager to see . " She was aware again that she was only a little older than he and that there was something grotesque about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame now , that she had made a special effort to make herself attractive for the meeting . She felt suddenly ashamed of being feminine and vain and almost whorish . Yet she was secretly pleased that he found her attractive . She said , " Thank you , Jacques . You need n't be flattering . It 's scarcely a time for that . " She asked him to sit down and said , " This is a painful business . I did not expect the marriage to be happy but I had hoped that it might outwardly be decent . " She put the dossier on the table beside her and noticed that he watched the action even while she was speaking . He said , " I assure you , belle-mere , that I tried to make the best of a bad situation . You may believe me or not . " " It has turned out very badly . " He looked away from her and the dissipated , good-looking overbred face grew serious . The seriousness brought sadness into it . He said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good best . 1 lave you ever lived closely with Alice ? Have you ever spent an vening alone with her ? " She saw where he was leading her and determined to avoid the trap . It was impossible to argue that Alice was brilliant or amusing or even companionable . She said , " After all , Alice is my daughter . "   " There is a curse on her , " he said , " Please believe me , I have no feeling of hatred for her . If I feel anything at all it is pity , but a pity which I wish to avoid having awakened by her presence . Pity may be an estimable virtue but it is also sometimes a painful emotion to the one who experiences it . I make no pretense of virtue on my part . I only believe one thing  --  that I have but one life to live . I am already thirty-nine years old . That is very old for a man who has lived as I have lived . I do not believe specially in self-flagellation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us failed . It was misery from the beginning . Nothing is worth that . " Then Susie said , " Not even with a hundred thousand dollars a year ? " She had meant to be nasty . Now she was forcing herselfand the effort : filled her with shame . " It might buy my body for a little while but never my soul . There are times when the violation of the soul renders the body impotent and incapable . " She said nothing to this . She thought , " What he is saying is at least honest , however unscrupulous may be the motives , however depraved the character . " It made it difficult for her that in her curious honesty ' she could not deny what he said of Alice . She heard him saying , " Alice does not want love , belle-mere . She does not know how to receive it or respond to it . I am not an unattractive man . Nor an inexperienced one . At least experienced women do not consider me so ; yet each time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an indignity but , what is much worse , as a bore . What she wanted was not a lover or a husband , but someone to sit with her doing nothing , nothing at all , during long interminable evenings . She wanted someone , a man to exhibit to the world as belonging to her . It was intolerable , belle mere . Believe me I tried . I am an impatient man , but I tried . " There was a kind of honor and anguish , a shadow of genuine suffering , in his voice that moved her despite all her bitterness , and she saw that to him the painful egotism and lack of spirit in Alice must have been an agony . It would have been the same with herself , if she had married some man who was dull and passive and conventional , instead of Gus . The man opposite her , however unscrupulous he might be , however depraved , was ofp229those who had been blessed with wit and intelligence , those in a strange way who were the elect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why then do you want to bring a countersuit against Alice ? " le was thoughtful for a moment , covering his face with his hands . At last he said , " That is difficult to answer , perhaps more difficult for you as an American to understand . I do not hate Alice . Divorce for me presents a problem which scarcely exists in your country . That Alice did not bear me an heir , that she seems incapable of having a child is something , but less important to me than to some men . There will be men in my family to carry on the title . I have , as you know , two nephews . I am not certain that I want to bring children into a world which I have never found especially satisfactory and which I see deteriorating to a level at which all men will he reduced to a uniform mediocrity . I do not believe in divorce . Even though Alice wins a divorce in the civil courts , it means nothing to me . Only an annulment in Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a divorce . But for that , I am frank to say , money , perhaps much money , may be needed . " She was beginning now to understand . He was being remarkablyhonest , as only the French can be honest . In spite of everything she found a satisfaction in dealing with a man who had no hypocrisy . She thought : Now the time has come . Now is the time to do it . Quietly she said , " There is n't going to be any money , Jacques . My husband was too generous to you in the first place . Money does n't mean anything to him . It 's just something to have around . He has no idea how rich he is , and so he throws it about . He does n't understand what good money can do or what evil  --  what colossal evil . " Watching him , she understood what had happened in his mind . He had come cheerfully believing that she meant to buy him off , and then he had noticed the dossier lying on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascinate him , for despite himself he kept glancing at it all through the conversation . She caught : He has seen a dossier before . It is n't the first time he'sen blackmailed !  | She went on talking in the same level voice , filled now with a kind of evil amusement at what she was doing . She said , " It would probably be cheaper to buy you off , but that is n't what I intend to do . You understand , money does n't mean much in the whole affair . It 's very likely that my husband at this moment has available as much as two billion francs . There 's no need for him to save it . He makes money all the time . Every day more comes rolling in from all over the world . You can understand that he would n't mind spending a billion francs just on this case alone . " She was being deliberately vulgar because it suited her purpose , and she saw that her course was having its effect . The astronomicalfigures she mentioned chilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are aware , I am sure , that a billion francs could buy all the newspapers in Paris , and also you are aware that most of them  --  and certainly the scandalous ones  --  are perpetually for sale . " ( This was on the sure information of Aspasie who had given her much good advice just before the interview . ) I-lc began to smile as he divined what she was up to , a curious smile of amusement and admiration , and again she felt a liking for his perverse honesty ; lie had planned to blackmail her into buying him off , very politely and in a gentlemanly fashion , and now he realized that the plan had failed and that she was about to turn the game against him . And he did not mind very much . He was enjoying the meeting and the conversation and admiring her quite sincerely for what she was doing . He was hopeless but somehow likable . " Yes , belle-mere , " he said , " I 'm aware of all that . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France or of carrying on any life here . Nothing that happens can affect her in relation to France . I doubt even that she would ever come to France again , even as a tourist . " " Yes , belle-mere . " Now the time had come . She reached for the dossier and his smile grew more radiant . " That , " he said , " is possibly a dossier on the subject of my evil doing . "  | " That is exactly what it is . " She untied the string very slowly , and he said , " You are very good at your game . " And again he smiled in frank admiration , as if he were admiring a fine performance by a great actress . " The trouble with you , Jacques , " she said , " is that you have no morals at all ... " " No , belle-mere , none . " His face grew serious suddenly , " Morals come out of moral background and I never had any moral background . My mother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my father . I never believed that I should n't enjoy myself in life . The body causes us great pain . It is only proper that it should give us in return great pleasure . It withers and dies all too soon . One had best enjoy it while it is still capable of providing enjoyment . " " What a philosophy ! " she said , " It is one in which self-respect plays no part . " " What is self-respect ? It is founded only upon conformity with what others have set up as a standard of behavior . That has no interest for me . I am an individualist , perhaps an anarchist . " " You are a voyou , " she said , conscious again that she was enjoying his company far more than she should . The dossier lay opened now in her lap . Monsieur Blanc and Monsieur de Trevillac had done a very neat , efficient job . It was even cross-indexed , according to vice and according to names of persons involved . It was a perfectly fantastic record , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had better go on with the business . Do you know a Madame Lazare who has a strange establishment in the Rue Blanche ? " He smiled without answering and she turned a page , " A MadameCelestine in Marseilles . She had an establishment there as well as in Tunis . Her business is criminal under the Code Napoleonand her clients as well as herself are liable to prosecution and imprisonment . " She looked up at him and continued , " In all this you must remember that it is not only yourself who is involved . An expose would drag in the names of other important people  --  bankers and at least one cabinet minister . It would make a really horrible scandal and you would be responsible . It would not make you popular . It might make it almost impossible to live in Paris . Certainly it would be the end of the Jockey for you and the Traveler 's and a good many other things . " The smile grew broader and she was aware that he was scarcely listening . He was simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And turning the pages she said , " There is a voyou in the rue de Lappe commonly known as Pepe Le Marteau . That is a singularly unpretty story . . . especially for a professional ladykillerin a country where lady-killing is a profession . " He stood up and said , " Never mind . I see your point . You might read me a few more names just to see how good the record is , but I wo n't take your time . I am forced to say that your two investigators arc remarkably good and they worked very quickly . " She closed the dossier . " They had most of it on file . It appears that in their business they keep records of prominent people . You must occasionally remember , Jacques , that you are the Duo de 13rantcs and very fashionable and that you married the daughter of an immensely rich American milliardaire . These facts I 've been reading mean business at some time or other to gentlemen like Monsieur Blanc and his friend . It 's a kind of investment they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this to turn up . " He said , " Vous gagnez , belle-mere . And you gave a fine performance . My lawyer and yours will get together . " He smiled again . " There is only one thing ? " " Yes ? " " How did you know about what to do ? How did you know where to find your friends the private investigators ? " She did not answer him . " Was it Aspasie who found them ? " " It is of no importance who found them . " He kissed her hand , " Good-by , belle-mere . I am sorry that things could not have been different . I think that you and I might have made a remarkable couple . Together we could have gone a long way . I shall write to you now and then . " MRS . P'ARKINGTON 233 " Good-by , Jacques . " She tucked the dossier under her arm . " Good luck . " And then he was gone and she was aware of a desire to call after him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk . Now that the awful business is over we can enjoy ourselves . " It was n't often you met someone like Jacques ; too many people were bores , whose conversation was without spirit , only turgid , void and vapid mumblings . Then she heard the door close and knew that he was gone and suddenly she was very tired and filled with an unaccustomed sense of profound loneliness . It was the last time she ever saw him , although ' afterward , he had from time to time written her flattering and amusing letters that came year after year , three or four times a year until he was killed at Verdun . He did not even appear in court for he told his lawyers not to contest the case and she never knew whether he had given up his plan because of the blackmail or because of herself . It was one of the unsatisfactory , unfinished things which tormented her for the rest of her life . But " the terrible summer " was not ended with the divorce . She sailed with Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dull voyage marked by apathy and weariness , one of those periods in which nothing at all happened , which later in life seemed to have been utterly lost out of the span of existence . The Major and his secretary came aboard at quarantine . She had not expected him and so was in her cabin and he sent for Aspasie before he saw her , for what he had to tell he was without the strength or the courage to accomplish . For the first time in all his life , even his great vitality , his great egotism , were not enough . He had no son left , for Eddie was dead now too in a mining town in Montana . It was not until a month afterward that she knew for certain that her boy had shot himself and not until years afterward that she discovered he no longer wanted to live because he was sick with a disease which in those days no one mentioned in decent society . That had been the end of all his wild hysterical enjoyment of life . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Rockingham Hotel to hide away , alone , where no one knew her , like a hurt animal . There were many things she had to face , many things she had to think out for herself before she could return to live again with Gus . When she returned , she was aware of a new strength she had never had before ; after that summer she knew that nothing again could ever really hurt her . Lying there alone , tired and wakeful in the comforting darkness , Mrs. Parkington knew suddenly that at last the wounds had healed , for now at eighty-four , the memories of " the terrible summer " no longer had the power of giving her sharp pain that was almost physical . It was at last all very remote and hazy like a distantlandscape veiled by mists . In a strange way it was a part of the extraordinary richness of her life . She thought : Perhaps one day I will meet Eddie and Gus and Herbert again . Who knows ? Perhaps in another world I shall know them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I myself will be in that world a better woman  --  less vain and less hard , more understanding and stronger and wiser than I have been in this world . Toward morning she fell asleep . She was wakened by Manic placing the tray with her tea on the table beside her bed . When Mattie said , " Good morning ! " Mrs. Parkington noticed that she seemed more cheerful and this pleased her for Mattie 's own moods had an extraordinarily powerfuleffect upon her own despite anything her reason could do about it . When Mattie drew back the curtains , she saw that it was a beautiful day and that too cheered her . It would be a busy day but there were times when it was better to be busy than to think too much . That knowledge , she knew , had been Gus 's greatest strength ; he never reflected ; he was always busy up to the very end . He understood very little even of business for he was above all a gambler , but he knew how and when to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parkington felt remarkably brisk , perhaps because in those long dark hours while she lay awake living over again the unbearable hours of " thep235terrible summer , " she had achieved at last a certain release from the past . She had awakened , cleansed and purified , with an extraordinary sense of freedom . It was almost like being reborn , like feeling as she had felt long ago as a young girl on waking , before there was any past to fill her with forebodings regarding the future . She said to Mattie , " You had better call Miss Bcascly and ask her to come at ten instead of ten-thirty . It will give us an extra half hour to go over things . " Mattie gave her a sudden searching look as if she were saying , " What has come over you since last night ? " And then said , " Do you think that wise , madame ? " " Yes , Mattie . I feel remarkably well this morning . Almost gay . " " You certainly beat anything , Mrs. Parkington " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction that she had won Mattie 's approval for once . The day was indeed going well . The newspaper was not cheering . The war was going from bad to worse , and she thought : There is no way of our keeping out of this thing . It has been coming to us for twenty years and more  --  oh , much more than that . Looking backward , it seemed to her that she could out of the past recall signs of it as far back as 1910 or 1911 or even before that in the days of their friendship with the Prince . The Prince too had seen it coming , although there were many things that he had not reasoned out that were not clear to him then or to any of them and had since become clearer , long after he was dead . Because this morning she felt exceptionally well , it was one of the occasions when Mrs. Parkington wished that she might g : , on living forever in order to see what came out of this tormenting , depressing , chaotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brave in its decency and understanding might be born of all the agony , and that would be something to sec . There were other times when , feeling less cheerful , she hoped to die quietly in her bed before her country too was swept into the misery of war and the confusion and bitterness of peace . But this morning she felt almost frivolous and even the depressingnews of fresh defeats for her friends the British and fresh misery for her friends the French , did not depress her . Nowadays , she reflected , people took far too immediate a view of everything . It was , she knew , difficult not to do so with news bulletins and commentators and headlines pounding at you every hour of the day . In the making of history it was not the short view which was important , the immediate defeats and victories , but those great turbulent waves of feeling which swept whole peoples to achievement or destruction . In this modem complicated world one could not see the forest for the trees . Everyone thought for d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreat from Dunkirk was all important and decisive , but these things were only a part of a much greater whole , pebbles beneath a great surging wave pounding upon the beach of time itself  --  just as the war itself was not in itself an end but only a manifestation of-a vast revolution engulfing all the world , a revolution of which Amory himself was a strangely minute and insignificant victim just as Gus if he had been alive now would have been a victim . As she drank her tea she turned away from the accounts of the war and deliberately thrust aside the heavy weight of the Times , taking up in its place the more sensational papers which she asked Taylor to get for her since the judge had made his remark about reading everything in sight in order to understand what was going on . In these she knew that she would find the first hint of what was going to happen to Amory . But in their pages she found no hint of disaster . Mattie returned presently and helped her with her bath and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and came up to the boudoir . She was a quick squat woman of thirty-eight , like Harriette Livingstone , a lady and consequently not too efficient , but Mrs. Parkington put up with her out of kindness because Miss Beasely'smother had no means of support but Miss Beasely and it was extremely unlikely that Miss Beasely could have long held a job in the world outside . Her very dress betrayed her character . She set out in the beginning to costume herself in clothes befitting a mannish , energetic , efficient woman , but sooner or later frills and ribbons and bits of lace had a way of attaching themselves top237various parts of her plain person , so that in the end there emerged a picture , neither of an efficient nor of a feminine woman , but only of one atrociously dressed . There were times when it seemed to Mrs. Parkington that the inside of Miss Beasely was very nearly as silly as the inside of Harriette had been up to that moment when she found expression in the salvage of stray dogs and cats . Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessed an immense power of irritating her employer , but Mrs. Parkington put up with her since Miss Beastly tried so hard and so desperately to overcome the profound sense of suffering and confusion roused by the mere sight of a column of figures . Now Miss Beasely , in a confusion of tweed and lace , opened her dispatch case and took out pencil and notebook and awaited orders . Mrs. Parkington first of all gave her a list of things to be done . Call Judge Everett and ask for an appointment . Ring up the South Street Settlement to discover if they had yet got the estimate on the new playground . Ring Miss Janie and ask her to come in at teatime . Order fresh flowers sent to ( Mrs. Sanderson and flowers to old Mrs. Edgerton who was dying at the Doctor 's Hospital . Call Mr. Montgomery who was writing a life of Edward VII and wanted her impressions and anecdotes and tell him that she would see him on Friday at four . Make the usual monthly checks for the British War Relief , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and the France ForeverFund for short-wave broadcasts and the Chinese Relief . Ring up Doctor Chung at Hampshire House and ask him for tea for Monday . She recited them all as they came through her head , all the endless , dull , sometimes annoying tasks which devoured so much of time and of thought . Besides all these there was the great pile of letters which had to be answered , letters of every kind and sort from fawning ones begging for help for someone she had never seen , through letters which had to do with business , to the semipersonalones which were the most tiresome of all because the senders presumed upon friendship or acquaintance to ask you to do impossible things.  | Mrs. Parkington was aware that many people said she was a wonderful woman and how wonderful it was that at her age she remained so interested and conscientious about so many things , but she had no illusions ; she was not wonderful at all . If she had been really strong she would have chucked the whole lot into a wastepaper basket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitality and disrupt the pleasant routine of existence . She was not wonderful at all ; she was simply the victim of a compulsion from which she would not save herself . In the midst of her morning 's work , Taylor knocked at the door and came in to say that there was a woman belowstairs who wished to see her . Ile carried a note which he said the woman had given him to deliver to her . Mrs. Parkington took the note and told Taylor to wait . She tore it open and read : Dear Madame : I realize that what I am doing is not a correct thing to do but the case was so urgent that 1 overstepped the bounds of etiquette . I must see you . It concerns Mr .. Stilhamand myself . 1 am frantic and do not know which way to turn . Only a moment of your time would make a great difference to me . I apologize profoundly for intrudingupon your privacy . Hoping that you will grant this favor , I amYours sincerely , Esther Hobson ( Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note she conceived a picture of Mrs. Hobson  --  that she was vulgar , that she was timid , that she was frightened and that she had a pitiful awe of wealth . Possibly she occupied some small niche in life which was sheltered but also limited . Who she was or what she wanted , Mrs. Parkington did not know . From the letter she judged that the woman wasp239both pretentious and toadying and beyond question a bore . But her curiosity , she knew , would force her to see the woman , and in any case the way things stood now she would have to see anyone who knew anything whatever about Amory . If he was to be saved , the salvation must come accidentally now from some unexpectedquarter . She said to Taylor , " Take her into the small sitting room and tell her I 'll be down directly . " Then very quickly she finished the immediate business with Miss Beasely and went downstairs . The woman was almost exactly what she had expected and the discovery made Mrs. Parkington feel both clever and pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly and came toward her . Before Mrs. Parkington was able to say anything , , she said , " I apologize for having intruded upon you . " ( It was the wording out of a column given as advice on etiquette . ) " My name is Esther Hobson . " " How do you do ? " said Mrs. Parkington , and then saw that Mrs. Hobson 's eyes were red from weeping . " Please sit down . " Mrs. Hobson appeared to be in her middle forties , a pretty woman in a banal fashion , with too-small features and more than inclined toward plumpness . Mrs. Parkington divined that as a young girl she must have been extraordinarily pretty . She was dressed in the kind of clothes which are a poor imitation of smart ones , which somehow go awry in line , in pattern , in material , , resulting only in an effect which is neither bad nor good but only mediocre . She seated herself in anxiety on the edge of her chair . Mrs. Parkington sat down opposite her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do for you ? " Mrs. Hobson did not look at her . Instead she regarded the red handbag she carried , her fingers fondling the clasp . She said , " It is fiery difficult to explain . I do n't know quite how to begin . "  | " I am a very old woman , " said Mrs. Parkington , " You need not mind saying anything you like . " Again the woman hesitated and Mrs. Parkington , aware of the busy day ahead of her , wanted to say , " Do stop being silly and get on with it . " But she held her tongue and Mrs. Hobson said , " It may seem very strange , my coming to you of all people , but I was desperate . " " So you said in your note . " Mrs. Parkington had no desire to be unsympathetic but the woman did seem sillier and sillier . Then suddenly with an effort so great that her face became quite red , she said , " You sec , Mr. Stilham has been my friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The expression came out despite Mrs. Parkington . So that was it . " And now it 's all finished . " She began to cry . " That 's what I ca n't bear . It 's not the money so much as his throwing me over now , after all these years . " Mrs. Parkington said very quietly , " I would n't cry if I were you . That never does any good . Just try to relax and tell me about it . " " You 're very good to me . . . to let me take all this time . " " Never mind that . I should like to hear about it . I sha n't be able to understand if you do n't tell me about it . Where do you live ? " " In New Rochelle . I have a nice house there and I belong to several clubs . Nobody there has ever known anything about it . " She looked up now , a little encouraged by Mrs. Parkington 's curiosity which she misinterpreted as sympathy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a good many business trips and I used to go ahead of him and stay at the same hotel ... in different rooms of course . . . in places like Rochester and Cleveland and Kansas City . We never saw each other in New York except a few times when he wanted to see me and then it was n't really New York . It was in Newark or Brooklyn . But he gave that up . He thought it was too risky . " " Are you married ? " asked Mrs. Parkington.  | " No . I 'm a widow . I 've been a widow for fourteen years since before I met Amory  --  I mean Mr. Stilham . " " How did you meet ? " The woman looked again at her red handbag . " In Atlantic City , " she said . " It was just after my husband died . 1 went there for a rest . Mr. Stilham was there at some kind of convention and somebody introduced us in the bar . " A sigh interrupted her and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Parkington thought , " What a fool ! " Aloud she said , ' He is still a very good-looking man . . . only gone a little puffy and red in the face . " All the time Mrs. Parkington was listening , she kept seeing Amory , taking up the collection in St. Bart 's on Sunday , acting as governor of St. Bart 's school , appearing always as a model husband , father and citizen . It was n't simply that he was all these things ; he was a prig as well , always talking about standards and behavior and such stuff . He had dared to disapprove of people like Gus who , God knows , whatever else he was , had never been a hypocrite . She said , " What is it you want me to do ? Do you want me to persuade him to return to you ? " Mrs. Hobson 's face turned scarlet again . " No , I did n't expect that . That would be too much . " She coughed and held her gloved hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And then stopped talking again . Considering that she had to ask favors ft seemed strange that you were forced to pry the request out of her now . " Yes ? " said Mrs. Parkington , wondering whether this ' dull , commonplace little woman contemplated blackmail . " I do n't know whether you 've heard about Mr. Stilham 's trouble . He 's lost just about everything . " " Yes . I know all about that . " Mrs. Hobson looked down again at her handbag . " It 's been very hard on me . It was bad enough having him break off with everything . That just about finished me . " Suddenly , it seemed an idea came to her . " You understand , Mr. Stilham never gave me money . It was n't like that . " The face turned red again . " He paid for the expenses of the trips and gave me a present now and then but he did n't give me money . It was n't like that . " She seemed passionately anxious to cling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes of Mrs. Parkington the conviction that she was not a real kept woman . Opposite her Mrs. Parkington was listening with equal passion to this further revelation of Armory 's character . She was thinking that it was always unbelievable how consistent most people could be . If she had invented a mistress for Amory and devised a code of behavior for her it would be exactly like this . Mrs. Hobson , with her passionate desire for respectability , her pride in her position in New Rochelle as a clubwoman , was absolutely safe . She would never he indiscreet or attempt blackmail . She was exactly the sort Amory would pick . It must , she thought , have been a very pedestrian , dreary affair . What did they talk about , sitting in dark corners of " tea shoppes " and taprooms in Harrisburgor Newark or Kansas City . Amory must have been a very dull , uninventive lover , but no duller than the woman sitting opposite her . " You see , " Mrs. Hobson continued , " I was always independent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a good income . I did n't need to accept anything from Mr. Stilham even if he had offered it . But now my income is gone and I do n't know what I 'm to do . " She began to cry again , helplessly now , like a meek and not very clever child . " Now I 'll have to give up the house and leave New Rochelle . " Her anguish was genuine . Eve , thought Mrs. Parkington , could not have suffered more anguish at the expulsion from the Garden of Eden than Mrs. Hobson at the prospect of having to leave New Rochelle . " What happened ? How did you lose your money ? " " Mr. Stilham asked me to loan him my securities . He told me that he would make a lot more money for me , and now they 're gone and he says he ca n't pay me back . " Mrs. Parkington tried to remain calm . She asked . " How much did you lend him ? " " At that time , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty thousand dollars . " She took out her handkerchief and blew her nose in a very refined fashion . " And why did you come to me ? " " I thought you might help me . I did n't know where to turn . I was desperate . I could have married again but for Mr. Stilham . During the years we were together I had two offers . . . very good suitable offers . I refused them because of him . " There was no doubt of it , the woman was a fool , but that , Mrs. Parkington knew , did not make Amory 's case any the better nor Mrs. Hobson 's situation any the less pitiable . She thought suddenly : She is like hundreds of others who were ruined by Gus 's manipulations . They all want to get rich quick and they have n't any brains and when they lose their money they 're helpless . But Gus had never seen the women he ruined ; they were ciphers , remote and hazy and unreal , " widows and orphans " on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly never robbed his own mistresses . She said , " The whole business is very unfortunate , Mrs. Hobson . I do n't know what is to happen . It may be that things will work out so that we 'll be able to pay you back . " Mrs. Hobson 's face grew bright and expectant . " Do you really think so ? " " I do n't know . " " You see , it is n't as if I could sue him . If I did that I would lose everything too . I might get back my money but I 'd have to resign from my clubs . I 'd have to leave New Rochelle . I 'd have to give up all my lovely friends . " She was safe all right . Amory had certainly picked shrewdly . She was safe as a church . " I know you 'll forgive me , Mrs. Hobson , if I do n't give you any more time , " said Mrs. Parkington , " But I have a very full day and I 'm already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . If I were you I 'd go home and not worry about it too much . I think I can assure you that you 'll get back your securities or others of the same value . If you 'll give me a card , I 'll send it to my lawyer and he 'll keep in touch with you . " Mrs. Hobson opened the handbag and began fishing in the dis- order of lipstick and matches and cigarettes it concealed . With -- out looking up she said , " You 're very good to me . You 've changed everything . " She found the card at last and gave it to Mrs. Parkington . One more thing seemed to trouble her . She asked , " Do you think everything can be arranged so that Mr. Stilham wo n't get into trouble ? I would n't want anything bad to happen to him . . . I mean really bad , if you know what i mean ? " " I. know what you mean . I ca n't answer that . We can only hope for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to give up New Rochelle or your clubs . " " They mean a great deal to me , " said Mrs. Hobson . " I have so many lovely friendships and a lovely home . If you 're out driving some day I would love to have you see it . " " Thank you , " said Mrs. Parkington graciously but with utter insincerity , " I may take up your invitation . " She rose and asked , " Have you enough money to carry on with ? " " Yes , " said Mrs. Robson , eagerly , " Yes . It 's just the future ... You see I 'm not as young as I once was . " Mrs. Parkington held out her hand and Mrs. Hobson took it . Then suddenly in a swift gesture she swept Mrs. Parkington " s beringcd fingers to her lips and kissed them . " You 've been so good to me . . . so generous . " Quickly Mrs. Parkington snatched her hand away . " Do n't do that , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offend you . It was only that you 've been so good to me . . . so kind . " " I have n't been anything at all , " said Mrs. Parkington . Never , it seemed to her , had she hated all Gus 's money so much as in that moment , because it had the power to degrade a fellow human creature . " You must understand I was n't angry with you. , , She went with Mrs. Hobson to the outer door and watched her plump buttocks quivering as she tottered on her too-high heels , down the steps into the street . Then she turned away and instead of taking the lift , walked up the stairs because she was not yet prepared to face Miss Beasely and Mattie . She hadp245first to understand and analyze her own anger and contempt . The groveling gesture of Mrs. Hobson left her feeling sick , and the revelations about Amory had filled her with contempt . Amory , she thought , was the pattern of a " gentleman , " the kind of " gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let the grocer sing for his money . But Amory had n't even paid his gambling debts . Certainly there was something very awry with a system which produced men like Amory . You gave them every advantage of education and background only to have them develop the psychology of pimps . As she reached the top of the stairs the telephone was ringing and as she entered the room she heard Miss Beasely saying , " Yes , Doctor , I 'll call her . " He was speaking from St. Luke 's Hospital . He had just brought Mrs. Sanderson there from her flat . She had developed symptoms of pneumonia and was better off , he thought , at the hospital . No , up to now she seemed to be doing very well but it was too early to tell how serious a case it would be . Mrs. Parkington put down the telephone and turned to Miss Beasely . " Ring up Mr. Brearly and say that on account of illness in the family I sha n't be able to go to the Symphony Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then she called into the next room , " Mattie , get your hat and coat and go with me . We 're going to St. Luke 's . " She did not want to go alone . She wanted a friend with her . In her heart she knew that it was all finished . The Duchess was getting at last what she wanted . There would n't be any more need of drink or drugs . The Duchess died quietly and quickly , slipping out of life without pain in a dim fog of delirium in which she recognized no one about her . All the last night until early in the morning Mrs. Parkington sat beside the bed , knowing perfectly well that there was nothing she could do and that there was no hope . At the end , in order that Alice might die quietly and without strug- filing , they gave her again for the last time the drugs which for so long had dimmed the edges of daily existence and blurred the unhappy memories of the past . Mattie stayed with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waking suddenly now and then to apologize for having dropped asleep . Twice Mrs. Parkington suggested that she go home to her own bed , but Mattie knew that the old woman wanted her to stay there and nothing on earth could have driven her away . Mrs. Parkington was not afraid ; she was not even troubled , for she was aware by midnight that no skill , no knowledge , no amount of money could save her daughter from death . But she was lonely . There were many things which Mattie , out of their long intimacy , divined and understood . She knew , sitting there on the uncomfortable chair , her head nodding on her plump body , that Mrs. Parkington was thinking that the last of the children born of her own flesh was dying . When the Duchess was gone , she would be alone , for not even Janie who was so close to her , could ever take the place of her own child . Just before midnight Mrs. Parkington sent for Dr. Fletcher . He knew very little about pneumonia ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistress had not sent for him in any hope that he could save the Duchess , but because he was a very old friend and his presence there helped her loneliness and the conscience which even now still had the power to torment her with the faint , querulous reproach that somehow , long ago , she could have helped the woman dying there in the room with them . When the doctor arrived , tall and gray and slightly stooped , Matte said , " I think 1 'll go out and get some air . I 'll just walk around the block and come right back . " She knew that there was something her mistress wanted to say to the doctor alone . There was never any need to say it , for Dr. Fletcher knew what it was she wanted of him . He knew Mrs. Parkington very well and had known her for a very long time . He had dined with her many times alone , while they talked of all the strange dark tangles of the human mind which he knew so well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew Mrs. Parkington'smind , its quietness and sureness , its honesty , its quick intuitionand the long experience and understanding which lay beneath its brilliant surface . For a long time he had preferred her company to that of any other woman , even that of his own wife to whom he was devoted . Now as Mattie closed the door he said , simply , " I am sorry , Susie . It is hard for you . In spite of everything death is always hard . You 've been told the truth  --  that there is nothing to be done . There is another truth that I can tell you  --  that it is much better this way . Above all , it 's better for Alice herself . " He took Mrs. Parkington 's hand . " It is always hard for a mother to surviveher child but Alice is already an old woman  --  much older than you , dear Susie . There are things you know as well as I do  --  things you know by intuition which I have had to work hard to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead for a long time . She had a will to die . Nothing can bring her as much happiness as death . It is the only thing that can bring her peace . For a long time she has been seeking peace and oblivion . She was a very tired woman . " She said nothing but looked away from him , aware that tears were filling her eyes , not tears of sorrow or even now of pity , for Alice was already beyond the need of that , but of gratitude for something which she did not quite understand . In the quiet silence she heard the slow labored breathing of the dying woman . Then Louis Fletcher spoke again , " And above all , dear Susie , you must n't reproach yourself . The things which destroyed Alice were beyond your control . They were in Alice herself , when she was born , in her very glands when she was a tiny girl . The doom was already there . And it was there too in the world into which she was born , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hard or clever people could survive . " Then she looked up at him . She was a small woman and he was a very tall thin man . She said , " It was very good of you to come . It was very silly of me to have sent for you . I do n't know why I did . Perhaps I sent for you not as a doctor but as a friend . You have always been a very good friend . "  | She took her hand out of his and added , " Now go home . You have told me what I wanted to hear . It was something I knew already but I needed to hear you say it before I would believe it . " " I think you know me well enough to know I would n't be stupid enough to try to make you believe anything your intelligencerejected . What I have said is honest and it is the truth . There are people in life who are doomed by the very stars . There are others like ourselves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe , has given special favors , special reserves of strength and understanding . Why this is so I do not know nor does anyone else , but you yourself have lived long enough to know the truth of what 1 am saying . " The tears had wet her checks now . Very quietly she said , " Please go , Louis , quickly . You have done what I wanted you to do . " He picked up his hat and quietly without another word , he left the room and when he had gone she walked to the window and standing there with her back to the bed as if she were ashamed lest the unconscious dying woman should see her tears , she quickly dried them . Below her in the street , two cars passed each other . In the doorway opposite , a sailor and a girl stood in the doorway , their bodies pressed together in the eternalembrace which marked the beginning of all life . It had been raining and the reflections of the yellow street lights were drowned in pools of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off down the river the lonely whistle of a freighter sounded through the fog , and suddenly the strange , unearthlyfeeling of gratitude for life burst forth again from Mrs. Parkington 's heart . There were no words , or even thoughts which could translate what she felt . Only through music perhaps could it be clarified and given form . How long she stood there she did not know , for it was one of those moments in life when there is no time , when one 's very existence seems suspended in space . The sound of Mattie opening the door quietly roused her and she thought . Perhaps that is what death is . Perhaps in the end it is only death that brings complete understanding , for in thatP249moment it had seemed to her that she understood all that had ever happened to her , that all the tragedy , all the pleasure , all the satisfaction , the suffering had come together like a single superb tapestry in which every fragment , every line had a meaningand a beauty related to the whole . She asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , Mrs. Parkington , it is much warmer . " While the two old women sat there , thinking and dreaming , the nurse came in to take the pulse of the dying woman . She said nothing . She was a clever woman ; although death was familiar to her , she still respected it . It was one of the few things in life which , for every man and woman , partook of dignity . Watching her through half-closed eyes , Mrs. Parkington thought : All she is doing is futile , yet she is going through it because somehow we must go on , making gestures so long as the heart beats , so long as the breath stirs  --  gestures made in the very face of fate itself . Since Louis Fletcher had gone , since the curious moment of revelation at the window , there was peace in the room . The doubts , the fears were dissolved . There were people who in themselves had the power of bringing peace . Louis Fletcher was one of them ; the power had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her children she had seen die . Now suddenly it seemed strange to her that both her parents had died in violence away from her . So too both her sons had died . And then she thought of Gus , who had died quickly in the arms of a woman she had never seen , whose name she never even heard , in n hotel bedroom in Cannes , an old man fighting to the end against old age and death . Quite suddenly she understood that too  --  that to Gus the prospect of growing old and tired was beyond endurance . It was not peace he had sought , but violence and sensuality and power . In the end , she understood now , with a sudden clarity , he had been unfaithful to her not because he did not love her , but because in the beginning he could not help himself and in the end because he had tried to defy weakness and death with the gesture of a vigorous young man . And in the very gesture of life , death had taken him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world , would understand  --  that there had always been something magnificent about Gus which made her forgive him everything , that there were times when she was grateful for the curious quality of extravagance and splendor with which he had invested all their life together . That was a gratitude and forgiveness many women would never understand . XIIOutside on the river , the whistle sounded again , this time nearer at hand , and quite suddenly she was back again on the yacht in the basin at Cannes and it was early morning with the mist still hanging over the blue line of the Mediterranean and Mattie was in the room waking her and saying something about Captain MacTavish and when she had arranged her hair and put on a dressing gown and gone outside the cabin door , Captain MacTavish , red-faced and uneasy was standing there with a little fat , pock-marked sergent de ville . Captain MacTavish said , " I apologize for disturbing you , Mrs. Parkington , but something has happened to the Major . " Instinctively she started toward the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now scarlet as a poppy , said , " He 's not in there , madame . He 's at the Carlton . " He was a blunt man but now he was suddenly tactful . l le said , " It seems that he played at the casino until very late and then went to the Carlton for some champagne with friends and stayed on the night . " She knew immediately what had happened . It was the thing she had feared for a long time . She knew that he was dead and she knew how it had happened and she understood that whatever the sequence of events she must pretend that she did not know or understand anything , if for no other reason , only to save poor Captain MacTavish from embarrassment . Quickly she dressed . Mattie helped her , saying , " I can go with you , Mrs. Parkington , if you like . " But she refused Mattie 's offerp251Mattie 's presence would only complicate things . She thought , " Somehow we must get him back on the boat so that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clock and saw that it was a little before five o'clock . No one would be about , no one they knew . Through the chill mist she went with MacTavish and the sergent de ville to the Carlton , all the way on foot since she could not wait until they sent for a car and in any case the Major 's driver must not know of what had happened . In the hallway of the Carlton two old women were scrubbing the floor . The manager , unshaven , his hair still uncombed , was there in his frock coat and striped trousers wringing his hands and talking French as rapidly as he was able to articulate . She tried to check the wild flow of his speech . He kept say-. ing , " I do not know how it happened . Such a thing has never happened before . It is very unfortunate . Such a thing has never happened before in the Carlton . I apologize , madame . I apolo-gize . " Quite coldly she said , " Never mind all that . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something monstrous and grotesque in the idea of his apology . MacTavish tried to prevent her because , for all his gruffness he was a nice man , but she was aware that , with his incredible French and his lack of tact , he would never be able to manage the stupid sergent de ville and the hysterical manager . The thing would have to be done by herself . The manager kept wringing his hands and the door of the office nearby was opened suddenly and a fat short woman of fifty with a mustache came out . In the second the door was opened , there came from the room the low wailing sound of a woman 's voice , sobbing hysterically . The manager said fiercely to the mustachioed woman , " Get that grue out of here . Why is she still hanging around ? " The mustachioed woman disappeared again into the room and the others went with Susie in the lift and when they reached the door of the room , she said , " I would like to go in alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she had closed the door behind her and stood there looking down at him that the fact of his death had any reality , and even then what she saw was not Gus . Gus was life and vigor and enjoyment . Gus was good humor and recklessnessand warmth and tenderness . Gus was n't there at all . There was only the body of a man lying on the floor covered with a sheet , a stranger with Gus 's giant physique and strength , grown cold now and lifeless . It had nothing to do with Gus . She need never have come to the room at all . Quickly she turned and opened the door and to the manager outside , she asked , " I lave you a brancard  --  a stretcher , " and in a silly way he replied , " No , madame . We have only a wheel chair . " " Can you get a stretcher ? " " Perhaps , madame , at the hospital . " " It would require a requisition , " said the sergent de ville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps for an hour or more  --  the endless red tape without which the French seemed unable to exist . " There was no time . In English she said to MacTavish . " We must get him back to the yacht into his own cabin . " Mac'I'avish thought it a good idea , but difficult . The sergent de ville had not even allowed him to move the Major 's body from the floor to the bed . There must be a report first , an investigation . That was exactly what they must avoid . She turned quickly to the sergent de ville and said , " Could you use five thousand francs ? " The blue eyes widened in the pink face , " Five thousand francs ! Of course , madame . Five thousand francs ! Who could not use five thousand francs ? " " It 's for you if you make no trouble . The circumstances arc perfectly simple . I want the body of my husband taken to the yacht . " " It can be done , " said MacTavish , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " There is no stretcher . There is no time . There is only the wheel chair . " P253It took a moment for MacTavish to gather what it was she meant and then he said , weakly , " Yes . . . I see . " The sergent de ville was now scarcely noticing them . He seemed to be dreaming , perhaps of what he meant to do with more money than he had ever seen before in his life . To the manager she said quickly , " No one must know anything . " His hysteria was gone suddenly , translated into admiration . He said , " Of course , madame . Of course . No one will ever know , " and he seemed suddenly to become weak with relief . To MacTavish she said , " I will go back to the yacht and you will come to my room and waken me when you return . What about the crew ? Will they be about ? " " I think I can manage that . I will go ahead and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is any slip-up , I will say that the Major had a seizure while gambling . " Then she left them and hurried back down the stairs and through the corridor into the garden . As she passed the door of the office , it stood open . Neither the woman with the mustache nor the woman who had been wailing were there . It was quite empty . The whole thing went off admirably . A man washing the streets and two gardeners watering the cinerarias around the newly erected statue of Queen Victoria , saw an invalid being wheeled across the street toward the basin by a man in the uniform of a ship 's officer . The invalid lay back in the wheel chair , the hat pulled low over his face to shut out the rays of the rising morning sun . The workman and the gardeners were scarcely aware of what they saw . Invalids were common enough in Cannes and besides in few places in the world could the human race behave more strangely than in Cannes . Mattie had never been more magnificent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she asked no questions , accepting the statement that the Major was dead . When Susie said , " I 'd like to be alone now , Mattie , " she went away without a word . She was there in the passageway when MacTavish arrived and helped him with his grim task . When they had placed the body of the Major in his bed MacTavish took the wheel chair off the ship , to the end of the pier and pushed it into the blue water . Then he went back to the hotel and sent a messenger for the hotel physician . In her own cabin Susie threw herself down , her face away from the light , buried in the pillows . No tears came . She was suddenlyvery tired and she was aware of a feeling of great emptinessas if only part of her were alive . The death still had no reality . She only knew that something magnificent had gone out of her life , something she had loved , which had brightened all her existence , something too powerful for her which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . It was something she would never again find . For the rest of her life it would be as if she were only half alive . In the Major 's cabin there was a body but Gus was gone forever . At last the tears came , quietly , searing her eyes . They came out of her heart , out of the very depths of her body  --  out of her soul and her spirit for in a strange way all of these had belonged to him . The newspapers in every part of the world reported that the famous and fabulously rich Major Parkington was dead at seventy-one years of age in bed on his yacht " Navajo " at Cannes , France . Dimly she heard again the sound of the boat 's whistle through the fog and was aware that someone was standing before her and knew that she had been dozing . She heard the voice of the nurse saying quietly , " You can go home now , Mrs. Parkington . There is no longer any reason to stay . I have telephoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly noticed Mattie , sound asleep in her chair , her head sunk in to her short plump neck , her hat a little over her eyes , and she thought " I must get Mattie a new hat . She is so tiresome about spending money  --  saving it all for that niece of hers . She rose and crossed the room and laid her hand gently on Mattie 's arm . Softly she said , " Come Mattie . We 'll go home now . "  |p255It  was her granddaughter Helen who took over . Helen was like that . For all the drooping mouth and the listless unhappiness , she could be , except for Mrs. Parkington herself . the only really efficient member of the family . She was especially good at weddingsand funerals . At times Mrs. Parkington thought that much of Helen 's unhappiness and futility came of her having been horn at the wrong time and in the wrong station in life . In a small village , a small world , where there were endless small fragments of gossip and loose ends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even have been a splendid citizen . She was meant for a petty world , cluttered with details , and she had been born into a large world whose responsibilities she neither understood nor accepted . Now she was in the house quietly doing all the dull tiresome things which go with funerals  --  the telephoning , the announcements , the grim business of the undertaker , the calls and notes and flowers of friends and acquaintances . She went about quietly , engrossed in her task , the sagging mouth rising a little at the satisfaction of all the petty activity . She managed even Miss Beasely who resented orders from anyone but Mrs. Parkington . And Janie helped her ; Janie was in and out of the house bringing brightness to Mrs. Parkington merely by her presence . If the funeral had been left to Mrs. Parkington she would have said , " Let us have a cremation and a quiet quick burial without fuss . " But the thing was not entirely in her hands . It was clear that Helen and Amory believed there should be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious thing , Mrs. Parkington thought , how people whose importance was waning should always be so insistent upon " importance " for themselves . Gus had never needed to worry about such things as importance ; it was thrust upon him ; whatever he did was important and exciting . But there was another element which softened Mrs. Parkington and that was the thought of the kind of funeral Alice herself would have liked . It was a subject that they had never discussed but Mrs. Parkington knew that Alice would like her own funeral to be important as she had liked along ago the importance of her wedding to the Duke . Birth and marriage and death had been after all the only moments of importance in all the life of Alice . Public funerals like public weddings had long ago become for Mrs. Parkington barbarous affairs , remnants of some less civilized era in which there was time and place for primitive spectacles and festivals . Now she thought : I shall hate it all  --  the walking down the aisle , the odious show , the tiresome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains of Alice into the earth beside her father and brothers . I shall hate it all but no matter , it will give pleasure and satisfaction to a great many people . It would be like a christening of which Gus had said long ago , " It ca n't do the child any actual harm and it will give a lot of people pleasure . " There were , she knew , actually people who liked funerals , who went to theta almost professionally . She only wished that she need not be the central figure , that she might go incognito to watch all the people who came out from under stones , the forgotten once important people whose only contact with the great world any longer was through funerals , all the forgotten , rather decayed people from obscure , dingy brownstone houses who would come to St. Bart 's as to a kind of village homecomingbecause they knew that the ceremony for the daughter of the rich and fashionable Mrs. Parkington would attract great crowds . They would see people there whom they had not perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashionable funeral . So to Helen she said , " My dear , I will leave it all in your hands , willingly . " And so Helen did a really splendid job . The obituaries were splendid and occupied a great deal of space , especially in the Times , the Tribune and the Sun . There were pictures of Alice , years old , taken from the newspaper " morgues " and an account of her marriages to the Duc de Brantes , Lionel Swinford , the remittance man , and Alfred Sanderson of Pasadena . But the odd thing was that nearly half the space was given over to the Major who had been dead for nearly thirty years , to his achievements , P257his fame , his spectacular history . Even in the grave he was more " important " than most people who were living , far more important than any of his descendants . Flowers came in great sheafs , in baskets and blankets and set pieces and Mrs. Parkington , annoyed by the great number of them , was coldly aware that they were offerings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself because she was rich and important and powerful . If she had died first , the offerings to Alice who had been almost forgotten by the great world , would have been miserable indeed . When she herself died everything , she knew , would fall apart ; in a few years after her death , the whole family would disappear into obscurity and only in history would the memory of the Major survive . Only once did Amory come to the house and then she man aged to see him alone for a moment . The disturbance of death had made her forget for a little time the trouble of her grandsonin-law . He was still drinking and although his eyes were swollen and bloodshot and his handsome empty face the color of mahogany , he seemed to make sense . He did not know what the Grand jury meant to do , nor how far the hearing had advanced , but it was clear that he had given up hope and was making no effort to save himself , trusting only to some turn of luck which by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morose and said , " It does not matter . In any case it is the end of everything  --  for all our class . The whole world is going to hell . I might as well have a peaceful time of it in jail . " It was a silly statement and she asked , " What do you mean by our class , Amory ? I am not aware of belonging to any class . I happen to have a great deal of money , but that is an accident . " " I mean , " he said heavily , searching for words , " All the people who have standards , who were brought up to believe that traditionand decency and responsible government were important . " She did not answer . She only thought : The man is completely crazy . There was no use in talking to him . The very words he used had no meaning for her , or a meaning so distorted that the conversation could only become empty and without significance . He grinned at her , showing one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least , " he said , " Helen is happy . I think she should have been a caterer or a female undertaker or something . " On the day before the funeral , Janie had tea with her greatgrandmotherin the boudoir . Mrs. Parkington managed it so that they would be alone and in the middle of the half hour they spent together , Janie suddenly said , " Do you think , Granny , that GreatAuntAlice was ever happy ? " And Mrs. Parkington answered , " No , my dear . Now and then perhaps for a little while . She once had a Cairn terrier she loved very much . Its name was Sally . " And after a moment she said , " Happiness is an odd thing . Perhaps people who have never known it are not really unhappy . I do not know whether Alice ever knew that she was unhappy . SometimesI think only that life was intolerably dull for her always , and that is something which comes from the inside . The outside , other people , have very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy in any of her marriages ? " " No . I do n't think that she was . You see people are really happy I think , in proportion to how much they give out . Sometimes I think it does n't much matter what it is so long as they give out something . Your grandfather was n't always a good man but he gave a great deal . In a way he gave a great deal more than he took from others , and I do n't mean money . Money is easy to give away whether it 's a penny for a beggar or a million to charity . That 's nothing . It 's what you give of yourself that matters in time , in amusement , in stimulation . You see your great-aunt Alice never gave out anything and so she never got anything back . She just existed . I doubt that she was ever happy or unhappy . She might have been happy , she might even have been different but for allL the money her father had . It spoiled all her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was silent for a time watching the tip of her cigarette burning away . Mrs. Parkington regarded her , secretly , wondering what all this could mean to her . Presently the girl looked up and said , " Granny , I 've been thinking a lot lately and sometimes I 've thought just what you 've been telling me . I think my mother 's unhappy because she 's never had any fun . Everything was always arranged for her . Everything was always easy forMRS . PARIINOTON 259her . She 's never had any excitement . She 's never had to fight for anything . Nothing that ever happened to her was ever an adven-ture . " Mrs. Parkington said nothing and suddenly Janie began to talk again , rapidly as if what she was saying had long been shut up inside her . " Granny , I do n't want money . I do n't want any money at all except what Ned and I earn . You can leave it to all the others . They 'll need it because they could n't get on without it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housework or get a job and go away with him somewhere into a small town somewhere . . . like pioneers . I 'd like to get away from everything I 've known . " She looked shyly at her great-grandmother , " Maybe I sound very childish to you . " Mrs. Parkington smiled , " No , I do n't think so . Only I would n't underestimate money . In a way it 's all in how you use it , what you buy with it . It 's not worth anything in itself , but only what you can exchange it for . Most people exchange it for rubbish and so it does n't bring them either wisdom or satisfaction or selfrespect . You can not buy these either , nor what comes out of your mouth , nor what is inside you . " The old woman put down her teacup and said , " Did you ever talk about this to Ned ? He might like you to have money . It 's for him to decide too . " " I 've never talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he worries because some day I may be rich . He does n't like it . He 'd like it a lot better if I just worked for my living like any-body . " They got no further with their talk that day for Janie 's mother knocked and came in . She seemed calm and pleased about somethink , " I succeeded in arranging it , " she said , " Bishop Burchard himself is going to read the service . I think Aunt Alice would have liked that . " " That 's very nice , " said Mrs. Parkington , " I 'm sure Alice would have liked it . Thank you very much Helen . " But she was n't thinking really about whether Bishop Burchard read the service or not . She was thinking suddenly about the bishop 's grandfather whom Gus had bought with a new heating plant and a gift of fifty thousand dollars , and his horsefaced wife who had called on her long ago at the Brevoort . It was in a way a racketeer family , running a racket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teen right when he said that the Reverend Burchard would get along . His grandson shook hands with the same false enthusiasm , with the same show of teeth which looked false in the fierce intensity of the smile . He talked in the same mealymouthed way . . . In some ways it was fun to live so long , just to see how things turned out if for no other reason . On the afternoon of the funeral it rained , but the rain did not prevent a crowd from filling St. Bart 's and standing on the sidewalkoutside to watch the fashionable people arrive . The family entered the church by the vestry room but as Mrs. Parkington 's car passed the main door she lifted her veil a little to look at the people who stood outside the entrance . There were no young people among than , they were mostly women , elderly or middleaged , who could still remember that the woman for whom the service was being said had once been the Duchess de Brantcs and the daughter of the great Major Parkington . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wedding long ago at the house in Newport . She was glad of the mourning veil . You could look through it without people being able to see your face . They could n't see , that there were no tears in your eyes ; there was no necessity for feigning an air of tragedy and grief . It permitted her , too , to study the faces near her without their being aware of it . As she walked down the aisle from the vestry door near the center of the church , she saw that it was all exactly as she knew it would be . The church was filled , mostly by people who had come out of curiosity . There were all sorts of faces  --  old Mrs. Sack ville and her old maid daughter . ( Their money had vanished long ago . She had not heard of them for years . Annie Sackville had once been very pretty and smart . ) And the Manson twins , both widows , who must be nearly seventy , and Jim Donaldson , a whiskey-faced old pauper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Hercules mine business . And Sarah Goodson who , they said , never left her home among the Fifth Avenue shops except to attend funerals . In the fifty feet she walked on the arm of Amory , she saw perhaps a score of faces that she recognized and a dozen others which were vague and distantly familiar , and each one of them involved something of the remote past , memories , stories that were by now legends . This was one of the last of the fashionable funerals and she regretted that she happened to be one of the principal performers ; she would have preferred to be in the audience itself where she could study the faces . She understood suddenly that the remnants of a world which was vanishing , which was almost gone , had gathered here like sheep to attend the funeral ceremonies of one of the last of their number . In a few more years most of them would be dead , their houses closed or pulled down . The horses and yachts of most of them had gone long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snobbery and vulgarity and promiscuity of their era . The world had long since passed them by ; some of them it had mocked , some of them it had ruined , most of them it had already forgotten . She had lived long enough to have seen the world out of which these relicts appeared come into existence , flourish , wither and die . Once she had been a part of it but somehow she had escaped and gone on into a new and other world which was beyond the reach of most of them , a world which included people like the judge and Louis Fletcher , a world which was everlasting and indestructible because it was founded upon the eternal qualities of man 's civilization . In the expensive showy church , the spectacle was a bitter footnoteupon the shabbiness of mankind . Alice had been rich and a duchess , but that was not why they had come to her funeral ; cy had come because the occasion was an excuse to bring them II together once more . Like sheep , huddled together , they feltss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spentlarge part of their lives in their world , neither of them had ever tally been a part of it . They had seen it all ; they had lived in it Ike lodgers in a lodging house and in the end rejected it . Longfore Gus died they had chosen other worlds  --  Gus his gay and raffish one filled with declasse but human people and herself a world in which beauty and things of the mind were the standard . What both of them chose had nothing to do with money . What they attained could not be bought ; they would have had it if they had been beggars . They had escaped the ultimate vulgarity , that of buying things . As she reached the pew , she was suddenly very proud of Gus and of herself . They had been very lucky . She had come down the aisle on the arm of Amory because that was the conventional thing to do and since the whole funeral was the apotheosis of conventionality , it had to be done however distastefulit might be . Once she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one side and Janie on the other . It was a pity , she thought , that Alice could n't see the magnificenceof all the flowers , or perhaps she did see them and knew about them . She did have a curious feeling that Alice was not far away , that she was somewhere just on the other side of a curtain , taking part after a fashion in her own funeral . And she found herself wondering whether all very old people , like herself , had no fear of death nor any special desire to embrace it , but only regarded it with indifference , as a fact like the rising or setting of the sun . Perhaps others too had the same curious certaintywhich she was experiencing in this moment , that the death of the body was not the end of spiritual entity , but only a break in a journey , like transferring from one tramcar to another in the old days . Once when she had been younger , as at the moment of the boys ' deaths , the pain had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainty that she would never again , in this life , know the pleasure of seeing them smile , of hearing their voices calling to her up a stairway , of hearing Herbert 's funny chuckle and Eddie 's loud laugh that was so like that of Gus . This pain she had not felt when Gus died . Then she had felt lonely and once or twice , when she was very tired , she would have welcomed death . And now at the funeral of Alice she felt nothing at all , either at the death of Alice or the prospect of her own death which could not be far away . And while they waited for the service to begin , she thought that perhaps she had no resentment because her own life had beenp263so filled with human experience that it had , like a good book which one has enjoyed , to come at length to the last page . It might be that she experienced this serenity now only because in the past she had known as much suffering as pleasure ; and grotesquelyshe remembered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackmailed him into behaving like a gentleman  --  that " the body causes us in our lifetime great pain . Consequently it owes us the debt of all the pleasure we can wring from it . " That might be true too of human experience  --  that if one had too much happiness and satisfaction , or too much suffering and sorrow , the spirit itself became deformed and in the end t here was a lack of serenity and a sense of incompleteness which made one resist the fact of death . In her own life she had known extremes both of suffering and of happiness ; looking back upon it now , she was aware that in it there had been an even , a complete balancing of the scales . And presently through the veil she was aware of the figure of the bishop crossing toward the lectern and at the same time she became aware of the hymn being played by the organist . Until now she had not heard it with her mind although somehow it had penetrated her consciousness and perhaps had its effect upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnificencein the music , a splendor which filled her with a sense of elevation . There was no hymn more beautiful in its splendrous assertion of faith , no hymn as beautiful in the sense of music . I-Ier heart sang , Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott and she was no longer at the funeral of her daughter in fashionable St. Bart 's but in a tiny baroque church in Bad Gastein . XIVIt was a church , she had thought even then , such as churches should be , all pink and blue and gilt and with gilded cherubs t inging into space from the cornices . Outside it was a sunny autumn day and at the keyboard sat Eric , the late afternoon sun shining on his gold-red hair . He had gotten permission from the priest to use the organ and had been playing Bach fugues , explaining them to her , for at that time she was only in the midst of learning all about music . And quite suddenly he had turned from Bach into Ein feste Burg saying , " This too is great music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside her heart . She knew with a curious certaintythat the thing which she already knew existed between them was somehow right . . . that it was a beautiful and good thing and that if she denied it she would live with regret until the end of her days . It was something which might come to a woman once . It was not at all like her feeling for Gus . This feeling for Eric was quite different , so different that in yielding to it , she was doing no wrong because it was something she could never give Gus because he would neither understand nor desire it nor even be aware of its existence . And yet it was something she had to give if she were honest with herself and were ever to know the richness of existence which she must achieve . It was not that she said these things to herself ; they were said to her out of the fading sunlight , out of the splendor of the music itself . Out of the music a voice to which her body and spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful world . It is filled with beauty which was meant by God for man 's enjoyment . Th men who built this gay little church knew it . The man who wrot the splendor into the music you are hearing knew it . The painte knew it . The artists knew it . All those especially beloved by Go have always known it . To deny this splendor and beauty is evil . " She knew that Eric had brought her to the little church to wo her with music because all else had failed and he was young an ardent and in love . But it was very odd that it should be a by which seduced her . She saw him now very clearly as he turned from the keyboar to smile at her , a curious enveloping smile which seemed somehoa part of the music which still echoed in the little church . She saw the straight nose , the wide mouth and the dark eyes set in a face that was heavily tanned through his passion for mountain climbing . They went back to the hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night they dined together as they had done on the three preceding nights and afterward they sat drinking brandy on the terrace above the rushing little river and then in the moonlight she went back with him to the little hotel where the young men lived who climbed mountains in summer and skiied in winter . Until now , sitting here between Mattie and Janie , she had never understood the madness of what happened on that night and in the days which followed . Afterward , even when the news came to her of Eric 's death , it seemed to her that in Bad Gastein she had been another woman , a stranger ; that she herself , Mrs. Augustus Parkington , wife and mother , was utterly incapable of 1 what had happened , that in some way it had never happened to her at all . It had come at a time when Gus was more passionately interested in his vast manipulations than he was in herself or in any woman , when for the only time in his life women existed for him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was in Bad Gastein because he had sent her there for the cure to keep her out of the way , perhaps because he wanted , through shame , to conceal from her manipulations that were rather more ruthless and shady than usual . That was something she would never know for Gus had never told her and now he was dead . She had arrived in Bad Gastein , ill and depressed , troubled that perhaps the thing which had always existed between them was at last waning , at least on Gus 's side . She had thought ( She could remember it well even now , sitting here in the front pew at St. Bart 's ) : Perhaps he no longer finds me attractive . Perhaps , after all , the understanding between us had its roots only in a passionate physical attraction . Perhaps that is waning and with it the confidence , the simple pleasure , the zest we find merely in each other 's company . She was wrong , for that part of their love had survived everything , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eric and the whole thing was finished between them . What she did not know then and knew now because she was much wiser , was that men  --  especially tremendous men like Gus  --  could at times , when their plans or ambitions obsessed them , lay aside love and even women for a time , turning to them again when what they sought was realized , turning to them again with the same or greater zest than before . Of such a thing no woman was capable , since for a woman in love , love invested whatever she did  --  her plans , her dreams , her work , her very breathing . It was not a thing apart  --  " Man 's love , " she thought , beginning the old quotation " is of man 's life a thing apart . . . " It was extraordinary the truth which underlay all banalities , perhaps because they contained , each one of them , so much of human experience . Yet even now the memory of Eric had the power of bringing a sudden warmth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gus was not , careless and free and without ambition beyond draining from each day , each hour , each minute , all there was of enjoyment and sensual delight . She had learned much from the adventure of Bad Gastcin , much , much , wisdom which Gus could never have taught her , which she could not have learned alone . She learned that one must not calculate too much but seize the pleasure and the beauty of the moment , and Eric , somehow , in that little time had taught her to see inside many things , that you could not live at all by mind or by will alone , no matter how clever you were . The cleverest people she knew were very often the most empty , the ones who drew the least from the rich springs of satisfaction from which one could , if one knew how , drink one 's fill . Perhaps because of what she had learned from Eric she had afterward suffered no remorse . Certainly because of Eric she knew what magnificence lay inside the splendorous chords of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could not go about preaching because they would be dangerous to those without wisdom or appreciation . It was like giving fine wine to a drunkard to whom alcohol of any sort brought equal satisfaction . Perhaps that was ' why churches existed and fierce codes of morality and restraints and stupid admonitions  --  to protect those who were not strong and wise from a wisdom and a knowledge too heady for them . And she remembered suddenly a coarse , vulgar , lusty story which Gus had told her " . . . It is too bloody good for the common people . . . " and at the same time she heard Bishop Burchard 's voice reading . " I am the resurrection and the Life . . . " andp267thought , " I am a wicked old woman , unrepentant and unregenerate , thinking such things at the funeral of my own daughter . " Yet a voice told her , " All this is more important than the barrennessof the life of poor Alice who died in the end by her own desire because there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from people like Gus and Eric  --  those people whose relation to life and nature was so simple and sound and direct . " Poor Alice for whom nothing could ever be done .. . But because she disliked the bishop and felt a contempt for his worldliness , she could not go on listening to his voice and she drifted back again to Bad Gastein , seeing Eric again as he was the last time she had ever seen him , when he came to the station at Salzburg to see her off on the Orient Express , dressed in Lederhosen and a shirt open at the throat because when her train left he meant to go to Berchtesgaden to climb the very peak which Hitler had chosen long afterward as his vulture 's nest . He had not kissed her because of the other people in the station and because of Mattie who went on pretending she suspected nothing , but he had gone through the farce of shaking hands and saying , " I 'll be in Paris in April . Until then . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compartment , she had gone to the window to look at him again for the last time as he stood there looking up at her , one lock of hair fallen over his forehead , thinking : He is bright and beautiful and healthy and I will never again see anyone like him , for she knew perfectly well that this was something which could not be carried over the interruption of weeks or months or years . Once she was out of this pretty bright Austrian world , there would be no returning to it . What had happened was perfect , but it was finished now . If she could manage it , she would never see him again . If she did see him again , perhaps in months , perhaps in years , she would greet him as an old friend , for the madness would be gone , and in its place only a sentimental sadness . When the train pulled out she pretended to be absorbed in the landscape because she could not look at Mattie , but the pretensewas no deception because nothing could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dry her eyes and bloc her nose  --  tears not so much at the sadness of parting as oI happinessand gratitude that the thing had happened to her . And Mattie who then still had a faint accent which she could hear again now , said , " A small bottle of champagne might help , Mrs. Parkington . " That was the only time Mattie ever betrayed for a moment that she understood all that had happened , that she too somehow saw inside things . From that moment until this when she sat here in the pew , an old woman , Mattie had never spoken his name or mentioned Bad Gastrin . Only on the occasions of the Christmas parties when the little band came in to play Viennese waltzes , Mattie would never look at her . Sometimes she managed to disappearduring the whole time the band was there and when that happened Mrs. Parkington never called upon her or made any effort to find her . There were times when Mrs. Parkington thought that Manic had lived through those bright days of her adultery vicariously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had never seen him again for she heard , quite casually and by accident , through leter from Annie Pulsifer who suspected nothing , that he had been killed climbing in the Tyrol near Innsbruck . But by that tiine she knew that the thing between herself and Gus was beyond waning or destruction and the figure of Eric had become unreal like something a dream . And now she felt a nudge in her ribs and heard Mattie saying " It 's over , Mrs. Parkington . " The others had risen and the under taker 's men were bustling about carting out the great bundles of flowers . She felt a sudden desire to say to Mattie , " You couldn ' imagine where I have been during the services , " but restrained herself . But she thought : How wonderful it is to have had a satis fying life , full of excitement to which one can return at mornent of boredom . There was still the dull business of the drive to the cemeter and the brief service at the grave . She felt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the rest of it . It 's very dull but a lot of people are enjoying it . " Only of course you could n't say that , because people would simply think you were crazy.  |p269The  organ was playing , but the magnificence of Ein feste Burg no longer filled the church . It was an insipid evangelical hymn , vulgar and limited , and she thought again , " And the king said ' but it 's too bloody good for the common people . ' " The death and funeral were a kind of interlude which interruptedthe steady , busy flow of Mrs. Parkington 's life and providedin a curious way a kind of holiday from responsibility . Duringthose three days , the committee meetings , the appeals for help and funds , the troubles of all the family , had been put aside and nearly forgotten . For three days because there was death in her house , old Mrs. Parkington was permitted to lead a lazy life withoutcares , without the perpetual annoyance of the telephone and Miss Beasely 's good intentions . She hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save when it was absolutely necessary and then only to communicate or to obtain information . The telephoneshe said , was the invention of the devil . It permitted people to intrude upon your privacy , to poke into your affairs , to derange your existence . There was no more reason for people to expect you to answer a telephone call than to expect you to welcometheir barging into the room while you were in the midst of a bath . But the morning after the funeral , it all began over again with the arrival of Miss Beasely . There was a long list of things for Miss Beasely to do , and worst of all , Amory 's trouble returned  --  more menacing than ever . Mrs. Parkington realized that really she had done nothing at all to cope with the situation and now Amory , as if paralyzed , had simply folded up and taken refuge in drink . While she had her breakfast she went quickly through the newspapers but found there nothing , not even a gossip paragraph , which had any bearing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it was a sick world , it would go on being sick for the rest of her life and probably for the rest of the life even ofchild like Janie . A little later she said to Miss Beasely , " I want to give a dinner . Will you send out notes to Dr. Fletcher and his wife , to judge and Mrs. Everett , to Herbert Edmonds  --  he is in Washington now at the Mayflower  --  and to Count Sforza and the Dutch Minister . There will be some other names later as I think of them . " She thought : I 'd like to be rid of the wives but there 's nothing I can do about it . Wives of well-known men so often suffered from a deep sense of inferiority and took to asserting themselves , as they grew older , in all sorts of impossible and tiresome ways . I 'm getting slack and lazy , she thought , it 's time I pulled myself together and got interested again in the world . I 've had too much of the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , asked presently , " What day , Mrs. Parkington ? " She reflected for a moment , " Make it in ten days . People are busy nowadays . " She turned the pages of the date calendar on the table beside her . " Let 's see . That would be Thursday the twentythird . And please say that inasmuch as I am in mourning , the whole thing will he a simple dinner and no formality  --  simply a gathering of friends to talk . " She gave a long list of other instructionsand said at last , " And call Judge Everett and ask if he could come in about four o'clock . If you want me I 'll be downstairs . I want to clear away some of the flowers . I can smell them all the way up here . " It was the fragrance of the lilies , heavy and rich , which trou bled her . They were , in her mind , associated with funerals , an . now that all the sad dreary business was finished , the sooner i was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alic  --  would always be with her , a kind of perpetual reminder tha somehow in spite of everything she had failed to help her odaughter . She had a curious feeling that Alice had at last move . into the house and was sharing it with her . At last , in deat Alice had come home . A great many of the flowers , in pots , had been sent , not to the funeral but to Mrs. Parkington herself , and Taylor , proud of the tribute , had put them everywhere , on tables , on the floor , in the fireplaces , while she had been occupied with other things . Theyp271were handsome expensive flowers but there were far too many of them . The house looked like a florist 's shop and had a strange , exotic , suffocating smell . She opened the pantry door and said to Taylor , " Will you call up the florist and ask him to send his delivery truck . I want to clear away some of the flowers . There are too many of them . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want sent to the hospitals . Some of them are too heavy for me . " Resentfully Taylor called the florist and then came to help her move out the heavier pots . He hated to see them sent away ; it was as if somehow she was sending away her own prestige . While they worked , Taylor said , " It was a fine funeral , madame . Very distinguished . " " Yes . Very distinguished . " But by what she did not know . And then suddenly she remembered that Madeleine and her cowboy had not been there . Madeleine had sent a wire from Nassau saying that she would come by plane but she had not arrived . She was sorry , not because of the family slight or because she missed Madeleine , but because she wanted to see Al again . As they moved out the last of the heavy-scented lilies , it seemed to her that she wanted to see Al 's tanned , lean face and clear blue eyes more than anything in the world , more even than Ned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought no good news . As her lawyer he had talked with nearly all of the clients whose securities Amory had used and he had discovered a surprisingthing  --  that most of them , even one or two who had been schoolmates of Amory , felt bitterly toward him . Out of eleven , two were out of town and could not be reached , four were willingto let the matter drop if Mrs. Parkington paid their loss but the others were for pushing the prosecution . " It was very puzzling , " the judge said , " I had not expected that attitude , especially from some of them . I imagine that all of them would have been even harder but for you . They were all very sorry that you should have this trouble . What is it Amory has done that has so set them against him ? Most of them are friends or at least more than acquaintances . " Mrs. Parkington said , " Do you know Amory very well ? " " No . . . only casually . " " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pompous . . . no matter how high a station they occupy in life , you can always be sure that a pompous man is a stupid one who , sooner or later , will he found out . A few years ago Amory made a lot of money . He was insufferable . Caesar or Napoleon or Alexanderthe Great or God became less important to Amory than Amory Stilham . Now when he is in trouble , he has collapsed . Amory is , I 'm afraid , a very tiresome fellow . " " Dick Weston , " said the judge , his eyes twinkling with humor , " was very bitter . I-le said Amory should be punished for having let down his whole class at the very time when his class was being attacked . " " That 's Harvard Club talk , " said Mrs. Parkington . As she spoke someone knocked at the door and Mrs. Parkingtonsaid , turning , " Come in . " The door opened and Mattie stood there . Mrs. Parkington noticed that her face was deep red . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mistress . She gave Mrs. Parkington the newspaper and said , " Cook just brought this in . I thought you would want to see it at once . " " Thank you , Mattie . " Mattie went out the door , closing it behind her and Mrs. Parkingtonopened the tightly folded paper . She knew exactly what she would find but she had not divined the bitter wording of the headline . It read : GRAND JURY CHARGES RICH CHURCH AND CLUBMANWITH GRAND LARCENYBeneath it was a picture of Amory and Helen entering the ornate doorway of St. Bart 's  --  a picture which must have been taken on an Easter Sunday , and a caption which read :  |p273Amory  Stilham , vestryman of St. Bart 's Church , charged with theft by Grand Jury , accompanied by his wife as they entered the church last Easter Sunday . She handed the paper to Judge Everett . It had happened and now she was immediately troubled , not by the disgrace but by the vulgarity of the paper and the fact that she had been too late to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once ; she might be anywhere on the street or in a shop or a hotel with people saying , " Her father has just been indicted ! " They might be saying it even before Janie herself knew it . She rose and said , " I 'm going to leave you now , Judge . I must go to see Helen and Janie . There is n't anything we can do right now . " Then she said , " Will you help with the trial ? " " I 'm not a criminal lawyer and Amory has n't asked me . You can count on me to help all I can . " " It would make a great difference in prestige and respect-sbility . " He was thoughtful for a moment . " I 'd rather be out of it , Susie , but if you think my name would help , I 'd do it for your sake . " " I think it would help . " " My car is outside . I can drop you at Helen 's . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so many things to think out . " She refused even to take Mattie . This time she was quite firm . There was quite a quarrel about it . In the hallway of the Stilham house she was met by a chambermaid , one she had never seen before , for Helen was always changingservants . The girl looked at her in a stupid , frightened fashion as if there were murder in the house and then scuttled up the stairs . While she waited , Mrs. Parkington thought : This is a gloomy house . It 's as if there were invisible dust and cobwebs clinging to everything . ' What is it that makes it so dreary ? She began to study the furniture bit by bit . There was nothing wrong with any of it , yet the whole was terrible . She thought , " Poor Janie ! " and then the maid appeared again to say that Mrs. Stilham asked her to come up to her sitting-room . The door was open and Helen was standing by the window looking toward the door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth sagged bitterly and there seemed to be new sharp lines drawn from the nostrils to the lips . As Mrs. Parkington came in , she simply said , " It 's unbelievable . Why did Amory do it ? " It was curious that she did not even express a doubt concerning his guilt . Mrs. Parkington said , " I came right over . Where is Janie ? " " I do n't know . She lunched out today . She did n't tell me where . She never tells me anything any more since that boy came into her life . " " I want to find her . " Helen did not answer her . She said in anguish , " Why did he de it ? How could he do it to us ? " She blew her nose and added , " Do you really believe he did it , Grandmother ? " Mrs. Park ington sat down , " I 'm afraid so , my dear . He told me so himself . " " You knew it all the time ! And you never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anger . " You might at least have tried to prepare us . " She saw that Helen was going to be difficult . Firmly she said , " Now try to pull yourself together , Helen . It 's bad enough as it is . I did n't tell you because we hoped until the last minute that everything could be arranged . " " I suppose everyone in New York knew about it before me . " " I 'm afraid a great many people knew something about it . Certainly the ones who had the money taken knew . And I do n't imagine they held their tongues altogether . Even Cook heard about it . Judge Everett was working to straighten it out . He was working until the last minute . He was with me when Mattie brought in the newspaper . "  |p275Helen  began to walk up and down . Suddenly she cried out , " It 's that woman . I knew it would happen . It 's that . God-damned woman ! " " What woman ? " Mrs. Parkington asked innocently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to meet him in hotels in places like Buffalo and Kansas City . " " How did you know that ? " " I hired detectives . I knew something was happening . Twice they got the evidence . " " That was a vulgar thing to do . Why did you do it ? " " I had to know . I could n't stand it any longer . " " Were you planning to get a divorce ? " " You know I do n't believe in divorce . " " Then you were a very foolish woman as well as vulgar . Was it because you were jealous ? Do you love Amory ? " " I was n't jealous . I just had to know . " She flung herself on the chaise longue where Janie had found her reading at four in the morning . " No , I do n't love Amory . I do n't think I ever loved him . " So it was like that , and here was another woman who had not loved at all , who had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married to Gus ? But a man like Gus would have had no patience with her . He would have thrown her out . Aloud Mrs. Parkington said , " We are getting very far from the point . I can put your mind at rest . It was n't the woman who ruined him . He never gave her anything and he took everything she had as well . It was n't even as good as that . It was all just plain sordid . " Helen stopped crying and looked at her sharply , " How do you know that ? " " Because I 've talked to her . " " Do you mean that you received her and tolerated her after you knew ? " ' That 's a ridiculous , word tolerate . ' I tolerate a lot of people worse than she is . " Helen was drying her eyes and blowing her nose . She was really a very sour , unattractive woman now . She asked , quietly , " What was she like ? "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
