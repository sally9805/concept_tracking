txt The Army sent tanks and armored cars to the Tule Lake segregation center for disloyal Japanese as soldiers took over the camp today . Steps were swiftly taken to quell disorder following the beating of a civilian guard . Five hundred persons were questioned as efforts were made to find the leaders of the disturbance . By Rodney L. Brink Stop Correspondent of The Christian Science Monitor made it plain that steps are being taken to prevent a repetition 01 the demonstration even though the hundreds in the mob scene of Nov. 1 were " hoaxed " by some 200 ringleaders into advancing on the Center 's Administration Building to hear , as they thought , an address // 7 Army Takes Over to Quell Foment at Japanese Camp by Dillon Myer , National Director of the War Relocation Authority . An Army detachment with tanks and machine guns is stationed just outside the Center 's man-proof fence . The fence until today has included the Administration Building and the Center hospital , which were the scenes of this week 's " demonstration . " This morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the Administration Building and the hospital . Tule Lake Center , located near the center of a vast mountain valley , a prehistoric lake bed , only recently became the sole relocation center to receive Japanese and Japanese-Americans who are avowedly or known positively to be loyal to the Emperor of Japan . This , in . the case of the JapaneseAmericans , means that they are disloyal to the land of their birth , the United States . All inmates expect to return to Japan after the war , either as expatriates or repatriates . Meeting Planned Mr. Cozzens says that he and Mr. Myer had agreed to meet a certain " committee of 17 " on Nov. 2 to discuss questions of concern to the Center 's residents . But on Nov. 1 , shortly after the lunch period , groups from all parts of the big cantonment began moving toward the Administration Building . Mr. Myer , Mr. Cozzens , and Ray Best , Manager of the Center , went among the moving crowd and questioned some of its members . Several persons told them , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mess halls at lunch time that the National , Director , Mr. Myer , was about to speak to all inmates at the Administration Building . " We went back to the Administration Building , and were told by the staff that they had been told by some of the Japanese to stay inside . There were some tough hombres in the crowd outside . These held the crowd there after it had assembled . " A spokesman came in and asked if we would meet with a committee . We said we would , and a committee of 17 came ln . Ninety per cent of the members of that committee were members of a group evacuated from the Hawaiian Islands because the Army did n't want them there . " We had been talking about 30 minutes when a staff member came in and reported that Dr. Reece M. Pedicord , Camp Surgeon , had been beaten by a group of young Japanese . The committee of 17 was flustered , for it was obvious that they had not wanted that kind of an incident . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discharge of Manager Best and certain members of his staff . They said their food must be improved , that the Center had been paying only from 17 to 27 cents a day per person for its meals . We believed that the figure was about 31 cents a day , in addition to the produce the Center raised . They demanded oil for the streets , to keep the dust down , and more and better showers and toilet facilities . No Yielding " Mr. Myer told the committee that he would yield to no demand whatsoever , and I told them the same . We said we would be glad to examine the facts in any case they brought to us. and would take action in accord with these facts . " While the conference was . in progress , Mr. Cozzens said , the Japanese outside rigged up a loudspeaker system and Director Myer was asked to address the throng . He told them virtually what he had told the committee and , according to Mr. Cozzens , " was given a big hand . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both speeches were " accurately interpreted into Japanese , " Mr. Cozzens ' said . In spite of this applause , when one of their number told the Japanese crowd , over the speaker system , " you must give your all for Japan , " and then told them to remove their hats , bow their heads , and return to their homes . About two thirds of them followed instructions . The hats-off and bowed-head gesture was obeisance to the Emperor rather than respect to the authority of the WRA , Mr. Cozzens assured reporters . The Field Assistant Director believes that the committee ortrouble makers very greatly " lost face " among their fellows as a result of the meeting , Jockeying for power and prestige . he believes they were defeated , even though the Center 's staff was virtually held captive : or a time . " The Army would have come in at our request . " says Nit .. Cozzeits " but we would not make the request . There were women and children in the throng , and if the so- : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been serious bloodshed . " Cozzens says that WRA clops not wish to give up custody of the disloyal Japanese at Tule Lake and that the Army &les; not wish to assume that custody . lie believes that the present Center management , after a few resignations , will continue , and that the most serious phase of the situation has passed . Ready for Action SAN FRANCISCO , Nov. 5 The Tule Lake Japanese segregation center was taken over today by the Army and efforts made to determine the leaders of a disturbance . One thodsand soldiers in battle dress were said to have arrived at the camp for disloyal Japa-nese , Army Rule Confirmed Col. Verne Austin , commandant of the troops , confirmed that the Army had taken over the camp , but declined to give any further information . Ray Best , project Director , refused- telephone calls . Floodlights every 80 to 100 feet illuminated the TOO-acre. camp which is enclosed by two barbed-wire fences 40 feet apart . Inside this 40-foot band , which soldiers referred to as the " shootpw , strip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an unending parade . The few Caucasian personnel who retrained and those vhoin the Army asked to return after they had been evacuated were ordered to stay in quarters for reasons of . safety . Mayor A. A. Roderberger of near-by Tulelake , Calif. , said " Tule Lake is resting easy now that the Army has taken over . " United States soldiers today began the construction of a high , barbed-wire fence at the segregation center to keep in check the thousands of disloyal Japanese who on Nov. 1 held the Center 's offices in virtual siege . WRA Makes Announcement The announcement of the construction  --  designed to separate all administrative buildings and Caucasian living quarters from the estimated 16,000 internees  --  came from the War Relocation Author-. ity . Up to the present time , the Center 's fencing has surrounded both the barracks city and the Administration Buildings , including the hospital at which Dr. Reece N. Pedicord of Wheeling , W. Va. , was attacked during the mass demonstration of Nov. 1 . Under the new arrangement , the Army now will patrol the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the already installed fences confining the internees on the other three sides of the project . SAN FRANCISCO , Nov. 5 ? With groups both inside and outside juggling dangerously with serious trouble in the Tule Lake Relocation Center for disloyal Japanese , it will approximate the miraculous if further trouble can be avoided . The events of this week in the Center near the California . Oregon border . have approached the point of great seriousness . ? The groups mentioned are , with ' in the Center , Japanese who want the United States ' treatment of Japanese racials to enter the violent stage for propaganda purposes in Asia ; outside the Center , those who seek any ground for argument ? ment against the return of the Japanese-Americans to their farms and homes in the rich Pacific Coast areas , either presently or after the war . Firm Attitude " It is going to be , necessary for those individuals who. do n't want to live peacefully at Tule Lake to live some place else , " says Robert B. Cozzens , Field Assistant Director of the War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today after being one of approximately 200 Caucasians held virtual prisoners early this week by a mass demonstration of between 3,500 and 4,000 Japanese inmates of the Center . His implication is that the " some place else " will be a less pleasant habitation . The Field Assistant Director
