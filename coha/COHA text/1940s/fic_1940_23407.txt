Pedersen had come to give him his Swedish exercises . But a gun in the hip pocket was uncomfortable if you did things on your back , on the floor . He had taken it out and put it away in the writing desk in his study . Mr. Stoyte ran back to the elevator , went down four floors and ran to the study . The gun was in the top lefthand drawer of the writing table ; he remembered exactly . The top lefthand drawer of the writing table was locked . So were all the other drawers . " God damn that old bitch ! " Mr. Stoyte shouted , as he tugged at the handles . Thoughtful and conscientious in every detail , Miss Grogram , his secretary , always locked up everything before she went home . Still cursing Miss Grogram , whom he hated at the moment almost as bitterly as he hated that swine there on the roof , Mr. Stoyte hurried back to the elevator . The gate was locked . During his absence in the study somebody must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closed door he could hear the faint hum of the machinery . The elevator was in use . God only knew how long he would have to wait . Mr. Stoyte let out an inarticulate bellow , rushed along the corridor , turned to the right , opened a swing door , turned to the right again and was at the gate of the service lift . He seized the handle and pulled . It was locked . He pressed the recall button . Nothing happened . The service elevator was also in use . Mr. Stoyte ran back along the corridor , through the swing door , then through another swing door . Spiralled round a central well that went down two hundred feet into the depth of the cellars , the staircase mounted and descended . Mr. Stoyte started to climb . Breathless after only two floors , he ran back to the elevators . The service elevator was still in use ; but the other responded tothe call of the button . Dropping from somewhere overhead , it came to a halt in front of him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stepped in . " The old bitch , " Mr. Stoyte kept growling to himself and then , turning in memory from his secretary to Dr. Obispo , " The swine ! " The elevator came to a stop . Mr. Stoyte darted out and hurried along the corridor to Miss Grogram 's empty office . He thought he knew where she kept the keys ; but it turned out that he was wrong . They were somewhere else . But where ? Where ? Where ? Frustration churned up his rage into a foam of frenzy . He opened drawers and flung their contents on the floor , he scattered the neatly filed papers about the room , he overturned the dictaphone , he even went to the trouble of emptying the bookshelves and upsetting the potted cyclamen and the bowl of Japanese goldfish which Miss Grogram kept on the window sill . Red scales flashed among the broken glass and the reference books . One gauzy tail was black with spilled ink . Mr. Stoyte picked up a bottle of glue and , with all his might , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he shouted . " Bitch ! " Then suddenly he saw the keys , hanging in a neat little bunch on a hook near the mantelpiece , where , he suddenly remembered , he had seen them a thousand times before . " Bitch ! " he shouted with redoubled fury as he seized them . He hurried to the door , pausing only to push the typewriter off its table . It fell with a crash into the chaos of torn paper and glue and goldfish . That would serve the old bitch right , Mr. Stoyte reflected with a kind of maniacal glee as he ran toward the elevator . Walking at sunset up the castle hill , Pete kept thinking with a kind of tranquil exultation of all the things Mr. Propter had said to him . Barcelona had fallen . Spain , England , France , Germany , America  --  all were falling ; falling even at such times as they seemed to be rising ; destroying what they built in the very act of building . But any individual has it in his power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The solidarity with evil is optional , not compulsory . On their way out of the carpenter 's shop Pete had brought himself to ask Mr. Propter if he would tell him what he ought to do . Mr. Propter had looked at him intently . " If you want it , " he had said , " I mean , if you really want it . . .55 Pete had nodded without speaking . The sun had set ; and now the twilight was like the embodiment of peace  --  the peace of God , Pete said to himself , as he looked across the plain to the distant mountains , the peace that passes all understanding . To part with such loveliness was unbearable . Entering the castle , he went straight to the elevator , recalled the cage from somewhere up aloft , shut himself up with the Vermeer and pressed the highest of the buttons . Up there at the top of the keep he would be at the very heart of this celestial peace . The elevator came to a halt . He opened the gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tranquillity . He turned his eyes from the water to the sky and from the sky to the mountains ; then walked round the pool in order to look down over the battlements on the farther side . " Go away ! " a muffled voice suddenly said . Pete started violently , turned and saw Virginia lying in the shadow almost at his feet . " Go away , " the voice repeated . " I hate you . " " I 'm sorry , " he stammered , " I did n't know . . . " " Oh , it 's you . " She opened her eyes , and in the dim light he was able to see that she had been crying . " I thought it was Sig . He went to get a comb for my hair . " She was silent for a little ; then she burst out , " I 'm so unhappy , Pete . " " Unhappy ? " The word and her tone had utterly shattered the peace of God . In an anguish of love and anxiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under her bathrobe , he could n't help noticing , she did n't seem to be wearing anything at all . ) " Unhappy ? " Virginia covered her face with her hands and began to sob . " I feel so mean . . . " " Darling ! " he said in a voice of entreaty , as though imploring her to be happy . He began to stroke her hair . " My darling ! " Suddenly there was a violent commotion on the farther side of the pool . A crash as the elevator gates were flung back ; a rush of feet ; an inarticulate yell of rage . Pete turned his head and was in time to see Mr. Stoyte rushing toward them , holding something in his hand , something that might almost have been an automatic pistol . He had half risen to his feet , when Mr. Stoyte fired . Arriving two or three minutes later with the comb for Virginia 's hair , Dr. Obispo found the old man on his knees , trying with a pocket handkerchief to staunch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one clean and small , the other cavernous , which the bullet had made as it passed through Pete 's head . Crouching in the shadow of the battlements , the Baby was praying . " Holy-Mary- Mother- of- God- pray-for- **41;566;TOOLONG ath-Amen , " she repeated again and again as fast as her sobs would permit her . Every now and then she would be seized and shaken by an access of nausea , and the praying would be interrupted for a moment . Then it began again where she had left off . Dr. Obispo opened his mouth to make an exclamation , then closed it again , whispered , " Christ ! " and walked quickly and silently round the pool . Before making his presence known he took the precaution of picking up the pistol and slipping it into his pocket . One never knew . Then he called Mr. Stoyte 's name . The old man started and a hideous expression of terror appeared on his face . Fear gave place to relief as he turned round and saw who it was that had spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said ; then suddenly remembered that this was the man he had meant to kill . But all that had been a million years ago , a million miles away . The near , immediate , urgent fact was not the Baby , not love or anger ; it was fear and this thing that lay ' here on the ground . " You got to save him , " he said in a hoarse whisper . " We can say it was an accident . I 'll pay him anything he likes . Anything in reason , " an old reflex impelled him to add . " But you got to save him " Laboriously he heaved himself to his feet and motioned Dr. Obispo to his vacated place . The only movement Dr. Obispo made was one of withdrawal . The old man was covered with blood , and he had no wish to spoil a ninety-five dollar suit . " Save him ? " he repeated . " You 're mad . Look at all the brain lying there on the floor . " From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her prayers to scream . " On the floor , " she kept wailing . " On the floor . " Dr. Obispo turned on her savagely . " Shut up , do you hear ? " The screams abruptly ceased ; but a few seconds later there was a sound of violent retching ; then " **35;609;TOOLONG **39;646;TOOLONG th. - Amen . " " If we 're going to try and save anybody , " Dr. Obispo went on , " it had better be you . And believe me , " he added emphatically , throwing all his weight on his left leg and using the toe of his right shoe to point at the body , " you need some saving . It 's either the gas chamber or San Quentin for life . " " But it was an accident , " Mr. Stoyte began to protest with a breathless eagerness . " I mean , it was all a mistake . I never wanted to shoot him . I meant to . . . " He broke off and stood in silence , his mouth working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You meant to kill me , " said Dr. Obispo completing the sentence for him and smiling as he did so with the expression of wolfish good humor which was characteristic of him in any situation where the joke was at all embarrassing or painful . Secure in the knowledge that the old buzzard was much too scared to be angry and that anyhow the gun was in his own pocket , he prolonged the joke by saying sententiously , " Well , that 's what comes of snooping . " " I never meant it , " Mr. Stoyte re iterated . " I just got mad . Guess I did n't really figure out what I was doing . . " " Tell that to the jury , " said Dr. Obispo sarcastically . " But I swear it : I did n't really know , " Mr. Stoyte protested . His harsh voice broke grotesquely into a squeak . His face was white with fear . The doctor shrugged his shoulders . " Maybe , " he said . " But not knowing does n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg again to point an elegantly shod foot in the direction of the body . " But what shall I do ? " Mr. Stoyte almost screamed in the anguish of his terror . " Do n't ask me . " Mr. Stoyte initiated the gesture of laying his hand imploringly on the other 's sleeve ; but Dr. Obispo quickly drew back ; " No , do n't touch me , " he said . " Just look at your hands . " Mr. Stoyte looked . The thick , carrotlike fingers were red ; under the horny nails the blood was already caked and dry , like clay . " God ! ? he whispered . " Oh , my God ! " . and- at- the- hour- of- our- deathAmen-Holy-Mary . . . " At the word " death , " the old man started as though he had been struck with a whip . " Obispo , " he began again , breathless with apprehension , " Obispo ! Listen here you got to help me out of this . You got to help me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that to me ? " The white-and-tan shoe shot out again . " You would n't let them get me ? " Mr. Stoyte wheedled , abject in his terror . " Why would n't I ? " " But you ca n't , " he almost shouted . " You ca n't . " Dr. Obispo bent down to make quite sure , in the fading light , that there was no blood on the couch ; then , pulling up his fawn-colored trousers , sat down . " One gets tired of standing , " he said in a pleasant conversational tone . Mr. Stoyte went on pleading . " I 'll make it worth your while , " he said . " You can have anything you care to ask for . Anything , " he repeated without any qualifying reference , this time , to reason . " Ah , " said Dr. Obispo , " now you 're talking turkey . " X There was a tap at the door of Jeremy 's work room ; it was Mr. Propter who entered . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black tie as he had worn at Pete 's funeral . " You 've not forgotten ? " he said , when they had shaken hands . For all reply , Jeremy pointed to his own black jacket and sponge-bag trousers . They were expected at Tarzana for the ceremonial opening of the new Stoyte Auditorium . Mr. Propter looked at his watch . " We 've got another few minutes before we need think of starting . " He sat down . " What 's the news ? " " Could n't be better , " Jeremy answered . Mr. Propter nodded . " Now that poor Jo and the others have gone it must be quite agreeable here . " " All alone with twelve million dollars ' worth of bric-a-brac , " said Jeremy . " I have the most enormous fun . " " How little fun you 'd be having , " said Mr. Propter meditatively , " if you 'd been left in company with the people who actually made the bric-a-brac . With Greco and Rubens and Turner and Fra Angelico . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands . " That 's the charm of art , " Mr. Prop-ter went on . " It represents only the most amiable aspects of the most talented human beings . That 's why I 've never been able to believe that the art of any period threw much light on the life of that period . Take a Martian ; show him a representative collection of Botticellis , Peruginos , and Raphaels . Could he infer from them the conditions described by Machiavelli ? " " No , he could n't , " Jeremy agreed . " But meanwhile here 's another question . The conditions described by Machiavelli  --  were they the real conditions ? Not that Machiavelli did n't tell the truth . The things he described really happened . But did contemporaries think them as awful as they seem to us when we read about them now ? We think they ought to have been miserable about what was happening . But were they ? " " Were they ? " Mr. Propter repeated . " We ask the historians ; and of course they ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compiling statistics about the sum of happiness , nor any way of comparing the feelings of people living under one set of conditions with the feelings of people living under another and quite different set . The real conditions at any given moment are the subjective conditions of the people then alive . And the historian has no way of finding out what those conditions were . " He took Jeremy 's arm , and they walked together toward the elevator . Mr. Propter 's car was standing outside the front door . He took the wheel ; Jeremy got in beside him . They drove off down the curving road , past the baboons , past Giambologna 's nymph , past the Grotto , under the portcullis and across the drawbridge . " I so often think of that poor boy , " said Mr. Propter , breaking a long silence . " Dying so suddenly . " " I 'd no idea his heart was as bad as that , " said Jeremy . " In a certain sense , " Mr. Propter went on , " I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in the carpenter 's shop . Made him work too hard , I guess  --  though he insisted it was all right for him . I ought to have realized that he had his pride  --  that he was young enough to feel ashamed of admitting he could n't take it . One 's punished for being insensitive and unaware . And so are the people one 's insensitive about . " They drove past the hospital and through the orange groves in silence . " There 's a kind of pointlessness about sudden and premature death , " said Jeremy at last . " A kind of specially acute irrelevance . . . " " Specially acute ? " Mr. Propter questioned . " No , I should n't say so . It 's no more irrelevant than any other human event . If it seems more irrelevant , that 's only because , of all possible events , premature death is the most glaringly out of harmony with what we imagine ourselves to be . " " What do you mean ? " Jeremy asked . Mr. Propter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he answered . " If a thing seems irrelevant there must be something it 's irrelevant to . In this case that something is our conception of what we are . We think of ourselves as free , purposive beings . But every now and then things happen to us that are incompatible with this conception . We speak of them as accidents ; we call them pointless and irrelevant . But what 's the criterion by which we judge ? The criterion is the picture we paint of ourselves in our own fancy  --  the highly flattering portrait of the free soul making creative choices and being the master of its fate . Unfortunately the picture bears no resemblance to ordinary human reality . It 's the picture of what we 'd like to be , of what , indeed , we might become if we took the trouble . To a being who is in fact the slave of circumstance there 's nothing specially irrelevant about pre-mature death . It 's the sort of event that 's characteristic of the universe in which he actually lives  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lives in . An accident is the collision of a train of events on the level of determinism with another train of events on the level of freedom . We imagine that our life is full of accidents because we imagine that our human existence is passed on the level of freedom . In fact , it is n't . Most of us live on the mechanical level , where events happen in accordance with the laws of large numbers . The things we call accidental and irrelevant belong to the very essence of the world in which we elect to live . Annoyed at having , by an inconsidered word , landed himself in a position which Mr. Propter could show to be unwarrantably " idealistic , " Jeremy was silent . They drove on for a time without speaking . " That funeral ! " Jeremy said at last ; for his chronically anecdotal mind had wandered back to what was concrete , particular , and odd in the situation under discussion . " Like something out of Ronald Firbank ! " He giggled . " I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statues . They 're dreadfully unlifelike to the touch . " He moved his cupped hand over an imaginary marble protuberance . Mr. Propter , who had been thinking about liberation , nodded and politely smiled . " And Dr. Mulge 's reading of the service ! " Jeremy went on . " Talk of unction ! It could n't have been oilier even in an English cathedral . Like vaseline with a flavor of port wine . And the way he said , ' I am the resurrection and the life ' ? as though he really meant it , as though he , Mulge , could personally guarantee it , in writing , on a money-back basis : the entire cost of the funeral refunded if the next world fails to give complete satisfaction . " " He probably even believes it , " said Mr. Propter meditatively . " In some curious Pickwickian way of course . You know : it 's true , but you consistently act as though it were n't ; it 's the most important fact in the universe , but you never think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And how doyou believe in it ? " Jeremy asked . " Pickwickianly or un-Pickw ickianly ? " And when Mr. Propter answered that he did n't believe in that sort of resurrection and life , " Oho ! " he went on in the tone of an indulgent father who has caught his son kissing the housemaid . " Oho ! So there 's also a Pickwickian resurrection ? " Mr. Propter laughed . " I think there may be , " he said . " In which case what has become of poor Pete ? " " Well , to start with , " said Mr. Prop-ter slowly , " I should say that Pete , qua Pete , does n't exist any longer . " " Super-Pickwickian ! " Jeremy interjected . " But Pete 's ignorance , " Mr. Propter went on , " Pete 's fears and cravings  --  well , I think it 's quite possible that they 're still somehow making trouble in the world . Making trouble for everything and everyone , especially for themselves . Themselves in whatever form they happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance Pete had n't been ignorant and concupiscent , what then ? " " Well , obviously , " said Mr. Propter , " there would n't be anything to make further trouble . " After a moment 's silence , he quoted Tauler 's definition of God . " God is a being withdrawn from creatures , a free power , a pure working . ' He turned the car off the main road , into the avenue of pepper trees that wound across the green lawns of the Tarzana campus . The new Auditorium loomed up , austerely romanesque . Mr. Propter parked his old Ford among the lustrous Cadillacs and Chryslers and Packards already lined up in front of it , and they entered . The press photographers at the entrance looked them over , saw at a glance that they were neither bankers , nor movie stars , nor corporation lawyers , nor dignitaries of any church , nor Sena-MAGAZINE tors , and turned away contemptuously . The students were already in their places . Under their stares Jeremy and Mr. Propter were ushered down the aisle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what distinction ! There , in the front row , was Sol R. Katzenblum , the President of Abraham Lincoln Pictures ; there , beside him , was the Bishop of Santa Monica ; there too was Mr. Pescecagniolo , of the Bank of the Far West . The Grand Duchess Eulalie was sitting next to Senator Bardolph ; and in the next row were two of the Engels Brothers and Gloria Bossom , who was chatting with Rear Admiral Shotover . The orange robe and permanently waved beard belonged to Swami Yogalinga , founder of the School of Personality . Beside him sat the Vice-President of Consol Oil and Mrs. Wagner . . . . Suddenly the organ burst out , full blast , into the Tarzana Anthem . The academic procession filed in . Two by two , in their gowns and hoods and tasseled mortar boards , the Doctors of Divinity , of Philosophy , of Science , of Law , of Letters , of Music shafffed down the aisle and up the steps on to the platform , where their seats had been prepared for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of the stage stood a reading desk and at the reading desk stood Dr. Mulge . Not that he did any reading of course ; for Dr. Mulge prided himself on being able to speak almost indefinitely without a note . The reading desk was there to be intimately leaned over , to be caught hold of and passionately leaned back from , to be struck emphatically with the palm of the hand , to be dramatically walked away from and returned to . The organ was silent . Dr. Mulge began his address  --  began it with a reference of course , to Mr. Stoyte . Mr. Stoyte whose generosity . . . The realization of a Dream . . . This embodiment of an ideal in Stone . . . The Man of Vision . Without Vision the people perish . . But this Man had had Vision . . . The Vision of what Tarzana was destined to become . . .

A sudden distressing event . . . Carried off on the threshold of life . . . . A young collaborator in those scientific fields which he ventured to say were as close to Mr. Stoyte 's heart as the fields of social service and culture . . . The shock . . . The exquisitely sensitive heart under the sometimes rough exterior . . His physician had ordered a complete and immediate change of scene . . . But in spite of physical absence , his spirit . . .

The glory that was Greece reborn beside the waters of the Pacific . . . The flag . . . The mission . . . The manifest destiny . . . The will of God . . Tarzana . . . It was over at last . The organ played . The academic procession filed hack up the aisle . The distinguished guests straggled after it . Outside in the sunshine Mr. Propter was buttonholed by Mrs. Pescecagniolo . " I thought that was a wonderfully inspirational address , " she said with enthusiasm . Mr. Propter nodded . XI Even in London there was a little diluted sunshine sunshine that brightened and grew stronger as they drove through the diminishing smoke of the outer suburbs until at last , somewhere near Esher , they had traveled into the most brilliant of early spring mornings . Under a fur rug Mr. Stoyte sprawled diagonally across the rear seat of the car . More for his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was back again on sedatives , and found it hard , before lunch , to keep awake . With a fitful stertorousness he had dozed almost from the moment they drove away from the Ritz . Pale and with sad eyes , silently ruminating an unhappiness which five days of rain on the Atlantic and three more of London gloom had done nothing to alleviate , Virginia sat aloof in the front seat . At the wheel ( for he had thought it best to take no chauffeur on this expedition ) Dr. Obispo whistled to himself and , occasionally , even sang aloud . They were on their way to see the two old Hauberk ladies  --  on their way perhaps to finding something interesting about the Fifth Earl , something significant about the relationship between senility and sterols and the intestinal flora of the carp . With mock-operatic emphasis he burst again into song . " I drea-heamt I dwe-helt in mar-harble halls , " he proclaimed , " with vas-s-als and serfs at my si-hi-hide . And of all who assembled with-hin those walls , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had been sitting beside him , stony with misery , turned round in sudden exasperation . " Oh , for heaven 's sake ! " she almost screamed , breaking a silence that had lasted all the way from Kingston-on-Thames . " Ca n't you be quiet ? " Dr. Obispo ignored her protests . " I had riches , " he sang on ( and reflected , with an inward chuckle of satisfaction as he did so , that the statement now happened to be true ) ; " I had riches too grea-heat to cou-hount . " No ; that was an exaggeration . Not at all too great to count . Just a nice little competence . Enough to give him security and the means to continue his researches without having to waste his time on a lot of sick people who ought to be dead . Two hundred thousand dollars in cash and forty-five hundred acres of land in the San Felipe Valley  --  land that Uncle Jo had positively sworn was just on the point of getting its irrigation water . ( And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd twist the old buzzard 's tail for him ! ) " Heart failure due to myocarditis of rheumatic origin . " He could have asked a lot more than two hundred thousand for that death certificate . Particularly as it had n't been his only service . No , sir ! There had been all the mess to clear up . ( The ninety-five dollar fawn-colored suit was ruined after all . ) There had been the servants to keep away ; the Baby to put to bed with a big shot of morphia ; the permission to cremate the body to be obtained from the next of kin , who was a sister , living , thank God , in straitened circumstances and at Pensacola , Florida , so that she fortunately could n't afford to come out to California for the funeral . And then ( most ticklish of all ) there had been the search for a dishonest undertaker ; the discovery of a possible crook ; the interview , with its veiled hints of an unfortunate accident to be hushed up , of money that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fellow had fired off his sanctimonious little speech about its being a duty to help a leading citizen to avoid unpleasant publicity , the abrupt change of manner , the businesslike statement of the unavoidable facts and the necessary fictions , the negotiations as to price . In the end Mr. Pengo had agreed not to notice the holes in Pete 's skull for as little as twenty-five thousand dollars . " I had riches too gre-heat to couhount , could boast of a hi-yish ancestral name . " Yes , decidedly , Dr. Obispo reflected , as he sang , decidedly he could have asked for a great deal more . But what would have been the point ? He was a reasonable man ; almost , you might say , a philosopher ; modest in his ambitions , uninterested in worldly success and with tastes so simple that the most besetting of them , outside the sphere of scientific research , could be satisfied in the great majority of cases at practically no expense whatsoever . " But I a-halso drea-heamt which pleaheased me most , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting in a passionate tremolo , " that you lo-hoved me sti-hill the same , that you lo-hoved me sti-hill the same , that you loved me , " he repeated , turning away for a moment from the Portsmouth road to peer with raised eyebrows and a look of amused , ironical inquiry into Virginia 's averted face . She was staring straight in front of her , holding her lower lip between her teeth , as though she were in pain , but determined not to cry out . " Did I dream correctly ? " His smile was wolfish . The Baby did not answer . From the back seat Mr. Stoyte snored like a bulldog . " Do you lo-ho-hove me sti-hi-hill the same ? " he insisted , making the car swerve to the right as he spoke , and putting on speed to pass a row of Army lorries . The Baby released her lip and said , " I could kill you . " " Of course you could , " Dr. Obispo agreed . " But you wo n't . Because you lo-ho-ho-hove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " let 's say it in a more poetical way  --  because one can never have too much poetry , do n't you agree ? ? you 're in to-ho-hove with Lo-ho-ho-hove , so much in lo-ho-ho-hove that , when it came to the point , you simply could n't bring yourself to bump me off . Because whatever you may feel about me , I 'm the boy that produces the lo-ho-ho-hove . " He began to sing again . Virginia covered her ears with her hands in an effort to shut out the sound of his voice  --  the hideous sound of the truth . Because of course it was true . Even after Pete 's death , even after she had promised Our Lady that it would 4 ' never , never happen again  --  well , it had happened again . Dr. Obispo continued his improvisation . " Stop ! " Virginia shouted at the top of her voice . Uncle Jo woke up with a start . " What 's the matter ? " he asked . " She objects to my singing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole-hearted merriment . Along with the fine weather , the primroses in the copse , and the prospect of learning something decisive about sterols and senility , they accounted for the ebullience of his good humor . It was about half-past eleven when they reached their destination . The lodge was untenanted ; Dr. Obispo had to get out and open the gates himself . Within , grass was growing over the drive and the park had sunk back toward the squalor of unmodified nature . Uprooted by past storms , dead trees lay rotting where they had fallen . On the boles of the living , great funguses grew like pale buns . The ornamental plantations had turned into little jungles , impenetrable with brambles . Perched on its knoll above the drive , the Grecian gazebo was in ruins . They rounded a curve and there was the house , Jacobean at one end , with strange accretions of nineteenth-century Gothic at the other . The yew hedges had grown up into high walls of shaggy greenery . The position of what had once been formal flower beds was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crescents of sow thistles and nettles . From the tufted grass of a long untended lawn emerged the tops of rusty croquet hoops . Dr. Obispo stopped the car at the foot of the front steps and got out . As he did so a little girl , perhaps eight or nine years old , darted out of a tunnel in the yew hedge . At the sight of the car and its occupants the child halted , made a movement of retreat , then , reassured by a second glance , came forward . " Look what I got , " she said in substandard southern English , and held out , snout downward , a gas mask half filled with primroses and dog 's mercury . Gleefully Dr. Obispo laughed . " The copse ! " he cried . " You picked them in the copse ! " He patted the child 's tow-colored head . " What 's your name ? " " Millie , " the little girl answered ; and then added , with a note of pride in her voice : " I ' ave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five days ? " Millie nodded triumphantly . " Granny says she 'll ' ave to take me to the doctor . " She nodded again and smiled up at him with the expression of one who has just announced his forthcoming trip to Bali . " Well , I think your Granny 's entirely right , " said Dr. Obispo . " Does your Granny live here ? " The child nodded affirmatively . ' " She 's in the kitchen , " she answered ; and added irrelevantly , " She 's deaf . " " And what about Lady Jane Hauberk ? " Dr. Obispo went on . " Does she live here ? And the other one  --  Lady Anne , is n't that it ? " Again the child nodded . Dr. Obispo patted the tow-colored head again and said , " We 'd like to see Lady Anne and Lady Jane . " " See them ? " the little girl repeated in a tone almost of alarm . " Do you think you could go and ask your Granny to show us in ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . Granny wo n't let nobody come in . Some people came about these things . " She held up the gas mask . " Lady Jane , she got so angry I was frightened . But then she broke one of the lamps with her stick ? you know , by mistake : bang ! and the glass was all in bits all over the floor . That made me laugh . " " Good for you , " said Dr. Obispo . " Why should n't we make you laugh again ? " The child looked at him suspiciously . " What do you mean ? " Dr. Obispo assumed a conspiratorial expression and dropped his voice to a whisper . " I mean , you might let us in by one of the side doors , and we 'd all walk on tiptoes , like this " ? he gave a demonstration across the gravel . " And then we 'd pop into the room where they 're sitting and give them a surprise . And then maybe Lady Jane will smash another lamp , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you say to that ? " " Granny 'd be awfully cross , " the child said dubiously . " We wo n't tell her you did it . " " She 'd find out . " " No , she would n't , " said Dr. Obispo confidently . Then , changing his tone , " Do you like candies ? " he added . The child looked at him blankly . " Lovely candies ? " he repeated voluptuously , then suddenly remembered that in this damned country candies were n't called candies . What the hell did they call them ? He remembered . " Lovely sweets ! " He darted back to the car and returned with the expensive-looking box of chocolates that had been brought in case Virginia should feel hungry by the way . He opened the lid , let the child take one sniff , then closed it again . " Let us in , " he said , " and you can have them all . " Five minutes later they were squeezing their way through an ogival French window at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a twilight that smelt of dust and dry-rot and moth balls . Gradually , as the eyes became accustomed to the gloom , a draped billiard table emerged into view , a mantelpiece with a gilt clock , a bookshelf containing the Waverley novels in crimson leather , and the eighth edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica , a large brown painting representing the baptism of the future Edward VII , the heads of five or six stags . ' Hanging on the wall near the door was a map of the Crimea ; little flags on pins marked the position of Sebastopol and the Alma . Still carrying the flower-filled gas mask in one hand and with the forefinger of the other pressed to her lips , Millie led the way on tiptoes along a corridor , across a darkened drawing-room , through MAGAZINE a lobby , down another passage . Then she halted and , waiting for Dr. Obispo to come up with her , pointed . " That 's the door , " she whispered . " They 're in there . " Without a word , Dr. Obispo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and , like an animal with a stolen titbit , slipped past Virginia and Mr. Stoyte , and hurried away down the dark passage to enjoy her prize in safety . Dr. Obispo watched her go then turned to his companions . There was a whispered consultation , and in the end , it was agreed that Dr. Obispo should go on alone . He walked forward , quietly opened the door , slipped through , and closed it behind him . Outside in the corridor the Baby and Uncle Jo waited for what seemed to them hours . Then , all at once , there was a crescendo of confused noise which culminated in the sudden emergence of Dr. Obispo . He slammed the door , pushed a key into the lock and turned it . An instant later , from within , the door handle was violently rattled , a shrill old voice cried , " How dare you ? " Then an ebony cane delivered a series of peremptory raps and the voice almost screamed , " Give me back those keys . Give them back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door in his pocket and came down the corridor beaming with satisfaction . " The two god-damnedest looking old hags you ever saw , " he said . " One on each side of the fire , like Queen Victoria and Queen Victoria . " A second voice joined the first ; the rattling and the rapping were redoubled . " Bang away ! " Dr. Obispo shouted derisively ; then , pushing Mr. Stoyte with one hand and with the other giving the Baby a familiar little slap on the buttocks , " Come on , " he said . " Come on . " " Come on where ? " Mr. Stoyte asked in a tone of resentful bewilderment . He 'd never been able to figure out what this damn fool expedition across the At-lantic was for  --  except of course to get away from the castle . But , then , why go to England ? At this season ? Why not Florida or Hawaii ? But no ; Obispo had insisted it must be England . Because of his work , because there might be something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't say no to Obispo  --  not now , not yet . And besides he could n't do without the man . His nerves , his digestion  --  all shot to pieces . And he could n't sleep without dope ; he could n't pass a cop on the street without his heart missing a beat or two . And you could say " God is love , there is no death " till you were blue in the face ; but it did n't make any difference . He was old , he was sick ; death was coming closer and closer , and unless Obispo did something quick , unless he found out something soon . . . In the dim corridor Mr. Stoyte suddenly halted . " Obispo , " he said anxiously , while the Hauberk ladies hammered with ebony on the door of the prison , " Obispo , are you absolutely certain there 's no such thing as hell ? Can you prove it ? " Dr. Obispo laughed . " Can you prove that the back side of the moon is n't inhabited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but seriously . . " Mr. Stoyte insisted , in anguish . " Seriously , " Dr. Obispo gaily answered . " I ca n't prove anything about any assertion that ca n't be verified . " Mr. Stoyte and he had had this sort of conversation before . There was something to his mind exquisitely comic about chopping logic with the old man 's unreasoning terror . " But do you think hell 's possible ? " Mr. Stoyte began again . " Everything is possible , " said Dr. Obispo cheerfully . He cocked an car to listen to what the old hags were yelling back there behind the door . " Do you think there 's one chance in a thousand it may be true ? Or one in a million ? " Grinning , Dr. Obispo shrugged his shoulders . " Ask Pascal , " he suggested . " Who 's Pascal ? " Mr. Stoyte inquired , clutching despairingly at any and every straw . " He 's dead , " Dr. Obispo positively shouted in his glee . " Dead as a door nail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He seized Uncle Jo by the arm and fairly dragged him along the passage . The terrible word reverberated through Mr. Stoyte 's imagination . " But I want to be certain , " he protested . " Certain about what you ca n't know ! " " There must be a way . " " There is n't . No way except dying and then seeing what happens . Where the hell is that child ? " he added in another tone , and called , " Millie ! " Her face smeared with chocolate , the little girl popped up from behind an umbrella stand in the lobby . " Did you see ' em ? " she asked with her mouth full . Dr. Obispo nodded . " They thought I was the Air Raid Precautions . " " That 's it ! " the child cried excitedly . " That was the one that made her break the lamp . " " Come here , Millie , " Dr. Obispo commanded . The child came . " Where 's the door to the cellar ? " An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's locked , " she answered . Dr. Obispo nodded . " I know it , " he said . " But Lady Jane gave me the keys . " He pulled out of his pocket a ring on which were suspended three large keys . " There 's bogies down there , " the child whispered . " We do n't worry about bogies . " " Granny says they 're awful , " Millie went on . " She says they 're something chronic . " Her voice broke into a whimper . " She says if I do n't go somewhere more regular-like , the bogies will come after me . But I ca n't ' elp it . " The tears began to flow . " It is n't my fault . " " Of course it is n't , " said Dr. Obispo impatiently . " Nothing is ever any-body 's fault , Even constipation . But now I want you to show us the door of the cellar . " Still in tears , Millie shook her head . " I 'm frightened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the cellar . Just show us where the door is , that 's all . " " I do n't want to . " " Wo n't you be a nice little girl , " Dr. Obispo wheedled , " and take us to the door ? " Stubborn with fear , Millie continued to shake her head . Dr. Obispo 's hand shot out and snatched the box of chocolates out of the child 's grasp . " If you do n't tell me you wo n't have any candies , " he said , and added , irritably , " sweets , I mean . " Millie let out a scream of anguish and tried to get back at the box ; but he held it high up , beyond her reach . " Only when you show us the door of the cellar , " he said ; and to show that he was in earnest , he opened the box , took a handful of chocolates and popped them one after another into his mouth . " Are n't they good ! " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Do you know , I 'm glad you wo n't show us the door , because then I can eat them all . " He took another bite , made a grimace of ecstasy . " Ooh , goody , goody ! " He smacked his lips . " Poor little Millie ! She is n't going to get any more of them . " He helped himself again . " Oh , do n't , do n't ! " the child entreated . " I 'll show you where it is . " The effect was magical . Dr. Obispo replaced in the box the three chocolates he was still holding and closed the lid . " Come on , " he said , and held out his hand for the child to take . " Give me the box , " she demanded . Dr. Obispo , who understood the principles of diplomacy , shook his head . " Not till you 've taken us to the door , " he said . Millie hesitated for a moment ; then , resigned to the hard necessity of keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Followed by Uncle Jo and the Baby , they made their way out of the lobby , back through the drawing-room , along the passage , past the map of the Crimea and across the billiard room , along another passage and into a large library . The red plush curtains were drawn ; but a little light filtered between them . All round the room the brown and blue and crimson strata of classic literature ran up to within three feet of the high ceiling . " Where 's the door ? " Dr. Obispo asked . The child pointed . " What do you mean ? " he started angrily to shout . Then he saw that what he had taken for just another section of the book-filled shelves was in fact a mere false front of wood and leather . A keyhole revealed itself to a closer scrutiny . " Give me my sweets , " the child demanded . But Dr. Obispo was taking no risks . " Not till we see if the key fits . " He tried and , at the second attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed Millie her chocolates and at the same time opened the door . The child uttered a scream of terror and rushed away . " What 's the big idea ? " Mr. Stoyte repeated uneasily . " The big idea , " said Dr. Obispo , as he looked down the flight of steps that descended , after a few feet , into an impenetrable darkness , " the big idea is that you may not have to find out whether there 's such a place as hell . Not yet awhile , that 's to say ; not for a very long time maybe . Ah , thank God , " he added , " we shall have some light . " Two old-fashioned bull's-eye lanterns were standing on a shelf just inside the door . Dr. Obispo picked one of them up , shook it , held it to his nose . There was oil in it . He lit them both , handed one to Mr. Stoyte and , taking the other himself , led the way cautiously down the stairs . A long descent ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were four doorways . They chose one of them and passed along a narrow corridor into a second chamber with two more doorways . A flight of descending steps ; a succession of small rooms . One of these had been plastered and upon its walls early eighteenth-century hands had scratched obscene graffiti . They hurried on , down another short flight of steps into a large square room with an air shaft leading at an angle through the rock to a tiny , faraway ellipse of white light . That was all . They turned back again . Mr. Stoyte began to swear ; but the doctor insisted on going on . They tried the third doorway . A passage , a suite of three rooms . Two outlets from the last , one mounting , but walled up with masonry after a little way ; the other descending to a corridor on a lower level . Thirty or forty feet brought them to an opening on the left . Dr. Obispo turned his lantern into it , and the light revealed a vaulted recess , at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replica in marble of the Medici Venus . " Well , I 'm damned ! " said Mr. Stoyte . They emerged from the tunnel into a fair-sized room . At the center of the room was a circular drum of masonry , with two iron uprights rising from either side of it , and a cross-piece , from which hung a pulley . " The well ! " said Dr. Obispo , remembering a passage in the Fifth Earl 's notebook . He almost ran toward the tunnel on the farther side of the room . Ten feet from the entrance his progress was barred by a heavy , nail-studded oak door . Dr. Obispo took out his bunch of keys , chose at random and opened the door at the first trial . They were on the threshold of a small oblong chamber . His bull's-eye revealed a second door on the opposite wall . He started at once toward it . " Canned beef ! " said Mr. Stoyte in astonishment , as he ran the beam of his lantern over the rows of tins and jars on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole of one of the sides of the room . Dr. Obispo , meanwhile , was trying his keys on the lock of the other door . It opened at last . A draught of warm air flowed in , and at once the little room was filled with an intolerable stench . Dr. Obispo made a grimace and advanced along the stream of foul air . At the end of a short corridor was a third door , of iron bars , this time , like the door ( Dr. Obispo reflected ) of a death cell in a prison . He flashed his lantern between the bars , into the foetid darkness beyond . From the little room Mr. Stoyte and the Baby suddenly heard an astonished exclamation and then , after a moment 's silence , a violent , explosive guffaw , succeeded by peal after peal of Dr. Obispo 's ferocious metallic laughter . Followed by Virginia , Mr. Stoyte crossed the room and hastened through the open door into the narrow tunnel beyond . Dr. Obispo 's laughter was getting on his nerves . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he advanced ; then broke off in the middle of the sentence . " What 's that ? " he whispered . " A foetal ape . " Beyond the bars , the light of the lanterns had scooped out of the darkness a narrow world of forms and colors . On the edge of a low bed , at the center of this world , a man was sitting , staring , as though fascinated , into the light . His legs , thickly covered with coarse reddish hair , were bare . The shirt , which was his only garment , was torn and filthy . Knotted diagonally across the powerful chest was a broad silk ribbon that had evidently once been blue . From a piece of string tied round his neck was suspended a little image of St. George and the Dragon in gold and enamel . " A foetal ape that 's had time to grow up , " Dr. Obispo managed at last to say . " It 's too good ! " Laughter overtook him again . " Just look at his face ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Above the matted hair that concealed the jaws and cheeks , blue eyes stared out of cavernous sockets . There were no eyebrows ; but under the dirty , wrinkled skin of the forehead , a great ridge of bone projected like a shelf . Suddenly , out of the black darkness , another simian face emerged into the beam of the lantern  --  a face only slightly hairy . Clothed in an old check ulster and some glass beads , a body followed the face into the light . " It 's a woman , " said Virginia , almost sick with horrified disgust . The doctor exploded into even noisier merriment . Mr. Stoyte seized him by the shoulder and violently shook him . " Who are they ? " he demanded . Dr. Obispo wiped his eyes and drew a deep breath ; the storm of his laughter was flattened to a heaving calm . As he opened his mouth to answer Mr. Stoyte 's question , the creature in the shirt suddenly turned upon the creature in the ulster and hit out at her head . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . The creature in the ulster uttered a scream of pain and rage , and shrank back out of the light . " The one with the Order of the Garter , " said Dr. Obispo , raising his voice against the tumult , " he 's the Fifth Earl of Gonister . The other 's his housekeeper . " " But what 's happened to them ? " " Just time , " said Dr. Obispo airily . " Time ? " " I do n't know how old the female is , " Dr. Obispo went on . " But the Earl there  --  let me see , he was two hundred and one last January . " From the shadows the shrill voice continued to scream its all but articulate abuse . Impassibly the Fifth Earl scratched his leg and stared at the light . Dr. Obispo went on talking . Slowing up of development rates .. one of the mechanisms of evolution . . . the older an anthropoid , the stupider . . . senility and sterol poisoning . the intestinal flora of the carp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery .. . no sterol poisoning , no se-unity . . no death perhaps except through an accident . . . but meanwhile the foetal anthropoid was able to come to maturity . . . . It was the finest joke he had ever known . " No need of any further experiment , " Dr. Obispo was saying . " We know it works . You can start taking the stuff at once . At once , " he repeated with sarcastic emphasis . Mr. Stoyte said nothing . On the other side of the bars the Fifth Earl rose to his feet , stretched , scratched , yawned , then turned and took a couple of steps toward the boundary that separated the light from the darkness . His housekeeper 's chattering became more agitated and rapid . Affecting to pay no attention , the Earl halted , smoothed the broad ribbon of his order with the palm of his hand , then fingered the jewel at his neck , making as he did so a curious humming noise that was like a simian memory of the serenade in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whimpered apprehensively , and her voice seemed to retreat farther into the shadows . Suddenly , with a ferocious yell , the Fifth Earl sprang forward , out of the narrow universe of lantern light into the darkness beyond . There was a rush of footsteps , a succession of yelps ; then a scream and the sound of blows and more screams ; then no more screams , but only a stertorous growlin gin the dark and little cries . Mr. Stoyte broke his silence . " How long do you figure it would take before a person went like that ? " he said in a slow hesitating voice . " I mean , it would n't happen at once . . . there 'd be a long time while a person . . . well , you know  --  while he would n't change any . Do n't you think so , Obispo ? " he insisted . Dr. Obispo went on looking at him in silence ; then threw back his head and started to laugh again .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
