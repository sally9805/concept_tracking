txt Russia has lost another round in the great East-West power politics battle now being wages in the United Nations General Assembly . In spite of caustic and violent objections by Soviet delegate Andrei A. Gromyko , the Assembly 's General or Steering Committee has voted 9 to 2 to recommend that the Assembly consider a conference to amend the Big Five veto privilege in the Security Council . Russia and its " me-too " partner , Poland , cast the negative votes , with China , France , and India abstaining . The nine states which voted affirmatively were the United States Great Britain , Syria , Brazil , Chile , Cuba , Luxemburg , Mexico , and New Zealand . Small Nations ' Influence - The General Committee 's vote is symptomatic of a growing feeling on the part of the small-nation bloc ? a group which very well may prove to hold the balance of power in the crucial deliberations now under way at Flushing Meadow Park ? that the time is past for more wishful thinking about the veto . At the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 powers had expressed themselves in favor of some change in the veto rule , and the overwhelming majority of them were small or intermediate powers . At the moment , the consensus of authoritative opinion is that a resolution embodying an Assembly demand that the Security Council 's permanent members restrict the use of the veto to issues that come under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter , the section of the UN 's basic law dealing with enforcement measures to preserve peace and security , would seem to have a first-rate chance of getting through the 55-nation deliberative group , The Assembly , of course , has no power to enforce such a demand , and in view of Mr. Gromyko 's adamant stand , there is no assurance that Russia would do more than take polite note of one if it were made . Gromyko Protest Mr. Gromyko told the committee in forthright language that the move to amend the veto was nothing more than an effort to make it easier for other nations to impose their will on Russia . lie said his country " can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organs of the United Nations . " however , the whole picture needs to be viewed in perspective . It is becoming increasingly clear that what is happening at Flushing Meadow Park is essentially a duel between East and West for the support of world opinion . Stripped to their bare essentials , the speeches of both Sect etary of State George C. Marshall and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Y. Vishinsky amount to bids for the backing of the great weight of opinion and moral suasion which the General Assembly represents . The very fact that Russian has consented to enter such a duel would seem to justify the hope that it will not completely ignore this backing , regardless of which side should gain it . Tire ' Sputters Down The General Assembly has had I another 21 hours to think over the sensational charges hurled by Mr. Vishinsky at the United States in tine Sept. 18 session , anditencouraging to be able to report that most of the delegations have refrained from getting hysterical about the East-West split . Some delegates are frank to admit that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia as icgards the future of the UN and international co-operation . But this ' is not , happily , the %iew of the majority . In spite of the smokescreen of charge and countercharge , one fact remains : World co-operation can not be achieved by force ; only by conciliation . And hope of conciliation will remain as long as the Russian delegates stay under the same roof with the representatives of the 54 other nations which comprise the UN . Thus far Russia 's delegates have not given the slightest hint that they intend to pack up their bags and go home . A great deal of the shock of Mr. Vishinsky 's sensational blast has worn off , and there is arising the feelitig that its real purpose was to toss a propaganda , bomb into ( a ) American thinking ; ( b ) world opinion as epitomized by the Assembly , and ( c ) Russia 's " home " public both within the Soviet Union and the satellite countries . Strategic Maneuver In other words , Mr. Vishinsky was merely trying to improve Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the diplomatic conflict that is being waged between East and West if it is thought of in terms of military strategy . In the military field , one side or the other usually seeks to gain the initiative by mounting a great offensive , The other side invariably meets this with an offensive of its own . And then , after a reasonable period has elapsed , the side which remains the stronger launches a Htird or " grand " offensive designed to gain what it can from the give and take of the situation . There can be little doubt that Ih'e American Secretary of State has been thinking very much along these lines . Secretary Marshall 's historic speech this week can be likened to the first offensive ; Mr. Vishinsky 's diatribe to the second . The third offensive remains to be launched . At the moment it looks as though it will be the United States which will mount it , The side which launches the third or climactic offensive does not necessarily expect to gain all of its objectives , but it usually considers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement in Its over-all position .
