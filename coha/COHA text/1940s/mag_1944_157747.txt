Last week the Finnish Government rejected Moscow 's peace terms , enraged the Russians , and made all the world wonder . Just out of Helsinki , TIME Correspondent John Scott cabled from Stockholm : <P> " Already the Finns ' hard-earned high living standard has largely disappeared . But still they are determined to fight on with a grimness and single-mindedness which left me , after a fortnight in Finland , with increased respect for Finnish fortitude and brass , awe at Finnish political obtuseness , but increasing pessimism regarding Finland 's future . " <P> At the top , among Finnish politicos and businessmen , Scott found a single-minded determination to fight to the last Finn . " Their attitude towards the Russians is summed up in an old Finnish ' magic song ' : Just this much they will get from me : what an ax gets from a stone , a stump from slippery ice , or death from an empty room " <P> Scott discovered the same determination among Finnish peasants-but with a difference . The top men knew how little chance Finland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the peasants , all unknowing , confidently believed not only that Finland was winning but that she would continue to win . The Germans ? Finland would come out all right , anyway . Only among Finnish workers did Scott find a strong desire for peace , a strong disagreement with government policy . But they could not speak out . <P> Save or Destroy ? Last week 's hullabaloo from Moscow obscured the fact that Soviet Russia had lost a studied effort to settle the Finnish campaign without having to beat the Finns . Cabled Scott : <P> " Soviet Russia , like most countries , would like to have friendly neighbors . Finland , run by Ryti , Mannerheim , Tanner , and Linkomies , is irrevocably hostile to Soviet Russia . A relationship between Soviet Russia and Finland as ruled today , along the lines outlined by the Soviet-Czech pact , is out of the question . What can Moscow do about it ? <P> " First possibility : go in and throw out the hostile Government , then lay the basis for cooperation . This the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were thwarted . Second possibility : let the country have whatever government it has or seems to want , but weaken the country strategically and economically to the point where it could not possibly harm Russia . This the Russians did to Finland in March 1940 , when the taking of Viipuri , Hango and the Saimaa Canal placed Finland in a dependent position . But the 1941 world situation interrupted Russian plans and Finland became just that place d'armes which Russia did not desire . <P> " Now again Russia may choose between these two methods . Moscow 's proposals in February and March followed the second line of action . These terms-the 1940 frontiers , the harbor of Petsamo lost to Russia , and a heavy indemnity-would have reduced Finland to a position of economic dependency and more or less permanent military impotence . There probably would have been internal difficulties in Finland besides , as few governments in history have survived a lost war and Russia 's conditions would have meant to most Finns that Finland had lost the war . Moreover the Germans would probably have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
