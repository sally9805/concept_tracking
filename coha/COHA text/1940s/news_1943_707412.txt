txt The cotton picker , dragging his nine-foot sack behind turn as he plucks the white-ftbred bolls , is giving way to a machine in this area of northwestern Texas . The machine is the mechanical cotton stripper . Although not the kind of automatic cotton picker long dreamed about by plantation owners and farm equipment company engineers , the stripper appears to do an adequate job on the variety of short staple , lower grade cotton which grows in West Texas Because it collects the boll along with the vk hite fibre within it , the stripper wo n't do for the higher-grade cotton which makes up the bulk of the country 's crop . At the moment there is n't much demand for this short staple variety , most of which measures about seven-eighths of an inch . But a few speculators arc buying some of the present crop in the hope of a renewed demand from makers of surgical dressings. absorbent materials and cotton padding used by jewelers in packing . It Ana Post-War Prospects But Texas cotton men see the possibility of a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and peacetime production has been resumed Techniques developed in Texas and in eastern cotton textkle mills just before the war made it possible to use this short staple without weaving ? merely by pressing the fibres into sheets . as paper is made . These sheets ? it is.believed. may open a wide new market for low priced tablecloths . bedsheets ? draperies , tarpaulins and other items that do n't necessarily have to he woven . Texans also believe the plastics industry will give them a ready post-war market . The cotton stripper promises to cut the picking cost of the short-staple cotton . Fifteen strippers are already at work , and $5 more are coming this fall , to speed the harvest of high plains cotton It marks the complete mechanization of cotton production here , from planting through harvesting . Texans believe that it opens the way to a post-war annual production of three million to four million bales . from two mil lion to three million acres of land in this area , where the 1943 crop is only 500,000 bales . ( All of Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's crop Is 11.422.000 bales . . A. bale is 500 pounds of cotton . ) The cotton stripper is intended for use only in regions where the cotton plant attains a short , compact growth . and where all the bolls mature at the same time . In the larger cotton areas the plants grow tall . with sprawling branches . and the bolls mature . beginning at ' the bottom of the plant , over a period of 45 to 60 days . With such plants the most expensive operation in connection with cotton is the picking . with labor getting $1 to $1 50 per hundred pounds see a cotton . The mechanical cotton stripper , doing the work of seven to 12 field hands ? moves down the rows , tearing all the bolls from the plants . This work has been done by Mexican migrants . tens of thousands of them appearing in the region with the first frost . Their method of gathering was to snap oft the bolls , whether open or still green . This forced the use of ginning machinery which damaged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaning . It produced a sample of cotton which sold for one cent to three cents a pound less than better , long fiber grades . Japan Was a Pre-War Customer Before the war Japan was the heaviest buyer of this high plains cotton , which was very similiar to the short-fibred cotton Japan has been growing in Korea , and buying in China . Indo-China and Siam Germany . Poland and Italy were other purchasers This market has been lost with the war , and some high plains cotton is being sold for the making of cellulose for use in gunpowder and plastics . This year the crop has been valued more for the seed than for the cotton . the seed being pressed into oil and going into cake and meal in demand among dairy farmers and livestock feeders because of the shortage of protein feeds . This year drought reduced the crop in Texas where the ten-year production has averaged 3.419,000 hales . More serious has been the shortage of labor , the usual field hands having found other work . In the Lubbock area , with only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 20.000 field hands . In order to overcome this lack the manufacture of 100 strippers was authorized . They are made by C. E. Morris &; Co. , of Dallas . Texas . and are a development from an experimental model made by the Texas College of Agriculture and Mechanics . This machine in turn , was an improvement on the home-made cotton " sleds " which farmers first contrived in 1926 . That year the state turned out 6 million bales of cotton , but the price was so low that most farmers could not pay hand-pickers The sleds were crude contrivances of fence-pickets wired together , or dry goods boxes with a N. " notch in front . which were dragged along the cotton rows . stripping off the bolls . Operated try-Warm Trantor The new stripper , known us the Morco cotton harvester , is attached to and powered by a farm tractor Down the cotton rows it moves . tearing off all the bolls. whether open or not . and the leaves as well , delivering the mass to the gins The best time for use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also being offered to powers a chemical dust , developed by the American Cyanamid Co. , which is api ayed by hand or by airplane over the fields , and which withers the leaves in a dial .. at a cost rer acre , for material , of $1 . The stripper costs $1,440 , and the postwar cost , if quantity production is obtained , is estimated at . $500 It gathers from seen to ten bales of cotton a day from hells yielding three-fourths of a bale an acre . Other companies nave experimented with cotton strippers and the John Deere Flow Co. , has had one on the market for a number DOING THE WORK of seven to 12 field hands , the machine here pictured marks the complete mechanization of cotton cultivation and harvesting in the high plains of northwestern Texas . Known as the Morco two-row cotton stripper , the machine cleans all the bolls from the cotton plant , and Texans say , opens the post-war possibility of mass production of cotton on three million acres of land . of years . but It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Fort Worth and Dallas by W. Neal Smith , was used on about 150 of the largest cotton farms before the war and ten were sold to the Russian Government for the Turkestan cotton area . Smith is planning to resume making his machine after the war . The plains cotton is planted by machine and not by hand . as is the rule in older sections of Dixie . The high plains cotton is not " chopped "  --  a thinning out and weeding of the plants  --  which is another laborious hand process . Here the plants are left standing as they come up . each competing with its neighbors , and forcing all into a uniform height at maturity of not above 24 inches . Mass production in this way may yield somewhat more cotton per acre than the average for the whole South . but it takes 2,000 to 2.500 pounds of stripped cotton to gin a 500-pound bale . compared with the 1.200 to 1.600 pounds of seed cotton to the bale when picked by hand in the other areas High plains Texas counts upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acres of cotton , producing at least 150 bales . In the old South a cotton family averages not more than 5 to . 10 bales a season . grown on 15 to 30 acres , along with feed crops . The Cotton Picker Meanwhile , for the other parts of the South , a mechanical cotton picker has been developed by the International Harvester Co . It is a much more complicated and expensive device than the stripper . and even after the war , the company says . the market will be limited to large plantations , at a sales price between $3.500 and $4,000 Explaining the development of the picker after 40 years of research , the International Harvester Co says " Even now we do not claim it will pick cotton profitably under all conditions . But it has been tested exhaustively and we know it will pick cotton pi ofitably under the conditions prevailing in the principal cotton growing areas With the machine one man can pick as much cotton in a day as 50 to 80 hand pickers .
