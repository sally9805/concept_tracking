Federal Union in Peoria <P> Sirs : <P> I deeply appreciate the importance you attached to the third national convention of Federal Union , as shown by the generous space ( TIME , Nov. 22 ) . . . . As an old newspaperman , I was greatly impressed by the speed with which you " got on the street " with your report , especially since our convention came at your deadline . . . . <P> Had your correspondent enjoyed even one day more in which to have given a more considered report , I am sure he would have avoided a number of mistakes and given a more penetrating account of our sessions . For example : <P> " For two days , " your report says , " in a do-gooder atmosphere of maiden ladies , ministers , matrons , high-school students and professors , the Peoria convention drowsed . . . . " <P> Analysis of the total number of adult delegates and members registered shows that 54% were men , and of these almost exactly 50% were businessmen . ... As for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your correspondent 's high allergy to them , but would merely note that together they formed only 6% of the total registered . <P> Your correspondent gives a vivid impression of a convention " floundering " along , and then being thrown in its last hour into a " frenzy of plans " through a " bystander , " Mr. L. H. Schultz , who " stood just about all the aimless dreaming he could stand . " I dislike to spoil a dramatic story , but perhaps the facts will improve it : <P> At the start of the convention it was decided that its major task would be to find ways &; means to achieve its policy . Mr. Schultz , one of the delegates , took part in the general discussion . Then , with a dozen other businessmen &; women he sat up till 3 Sunday morning as our ways &; means committee to put these plans in shape . When he rose at that last hour , it was to present his own plan with the committee 's support . <P> Democratic discussion may seem inept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the end . Certainly those achieved at Peoria encourage faith in the democratic system for which Federal Union stands . <P> CLARENCE K. STREIT <P> President <P> Federal Union , Inc . <P> Washington <P> &gt;TIME , wrong on Sparkplug Schultz , assures Unionist Streit that 1 ) some of its best friends are ministers and professors , 2 ) it does not find democratic discussion necessarily inept and dreamy , 3 ) it agrees that results count. - ED . <P> The Patton Case <P> Sirs : <P> This fuss about General Patton losing his temper ( TIME , Nov. 29 , Dec. 6 ) makes us look pretty soft . Who the hell ever heard of a war going on without some emotional excitement ? If , in his excitement , he struck the wrong man , why start an uproar ? . . . <P> Of course some Congressman must call for an investigation to have something to tell the homefolks during the next campaign . Pretty soft ! <P> R. E. HALE , M.D. <P> Bellamy , Ala . <P> Sirs : <P> ... If Patton is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not fit to command troops . We would suggest examination by a civilian psychiatrist , followed by disciplinary action . <P> In the meantime , one of us is going to try an experiment . He is toddling down to the nearest military hospital to strike a sick colonel . If there is any protest , he will , of course , apologize .
