WRITE SORROW ON THE EARTH ( 260 pp. ) - Charles Christian Wertenbaker - Holt ( $2.75 ) . <P> This short , admirable novel about the French Resistance is written in a prose style which suggests that Author Wertenbaker is a refugee from the dictatorship of Ernest Hemingway . But if he ever suffered under that brilliant dictatorship , he is his own master now . He has fashioned an unobstreperous , supple instrument with which he can handle whatever he pleases . With deceptive quietness , he chooses to handle a good deal . <P> Write Sorrow on the Earth is chiefly the story of three people : an ex-professor named Paul Boissire , a young Spaniard whose nom-de-guerre is Bob , and Paul 's wife Simone . Paul , at 38 , is a middle-class intellectual whose revolutionary sympathies , though they have not frozen him along a party line , have impelled him to become a leader among the maquisards of the Vercors , in southeastern France . Bob , a veteran of the Spanish Civil War , is already , at 24 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close father- &-son-and; brain- &-bravery; - friendship which is impaired when Bob is tortured by the Germans ( for Paul is inadequate to restore his broken courage ) , and destroyed when Bob , on a mission to Paris , becomes the lover of Paul 's wife . In many ways the most searching and powerful passages in the book are those in which the husband and wife face this betrayal and learn , through painful self-examination , to re-evaluate themselves , their responsibilities and their marriage . <P> Then Paul returns to the front . The rest of the book is the plain , grim tragedy of men hopelessly trapped-thanks largely to the fact that the U.S. Army did n't bother to parachute them their long-promised heavy machine guns . TIME-LIFE Correspondent Wertenbaker 's handling of these and other military passages indicates that experience as a journalist is not always fatal to creative writing . <P> Write Sorrow on the Earth must be described as a " secondary " novel , in the sense that it would probably never have been written if Malraux and , to a lesser extent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar way . It also shows one chief lack within itself : it does not have much of the kind of energy which usually distinguishes powerfully talented novels . Yet it shines bright and steady beside many novels which have such energy . It has none of the death-neurosis or neurotic heroics of Malraux ; none of the softness of Steinbeck or Hersey ; none of the chest-thumping and little of the romanticism of Hemingway . It is the work of a good rather than of a possibly great novelist ; it is also the work of a mature and intelligent man .
