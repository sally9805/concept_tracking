The two prongs which the Japanese had thrust into the breast of China began to wither and recede . China 's heart still beat.The Jap appeared to be frustrated . <P> For weeks during the spring and early summer Japanese armies had pushed along the Hangchow-Nanchang Railway . Their two great objectives had been : 1 ) a safe supply line by land all the way from Shanghai to their Indo-China bases ; 2 ) destruction of air bases from which U.S. planes could bomb Tokyo . They were near to success when , instead of delivering the last killing blow , they faltered . Last week came reports of their slow withdrawal before desperate Chinese resistance . <P> Chinese had wrested back 135 miles of the Hangchow-Nanchang Railway , after a two weeks ' siege occupied Linchwan . The Japanese burned and destroyed as they slowly retreated , as though they never expected to be back in that country . <P> Near the seacoast , they evacuated Wenchow . Before the Japs wrested the city from the Chinese more than a month ago , it was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to Domei , " an important secret Chinese supply base . " Over its 10th-Century wall flowed smuggled Japanese goods for Free China , Chinese raw materials for Japan . More vexing to Japan 's military leaders , it was only 180 miles from the northern tip of the island of Formosa , a vital troop center and training ground , and 650 miles ( feasible bombing distance ) from Japan . These were the reasons why the Japs occupied it . Nevertheless , they abandoned it . <P> The Chinese , looking for subtle reasons for these Japanese moves , turned their eyes to the north . Reports came of new activity along the Siberian border . The Japs , they calculated , intended to turn their backs on China for a while to fight another war . The Chinese also looked to the south . The Japs , they calculated , intended to stab at China 's soft underside through Yunnan and Kwangsi Provinces . <P> There might be a simpler explanation : that the Japanese were actually as frustrated as they appeared . Aided by U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Chinese Army was fighting with renewed confidence and vigor . Far to the south the U.S. had wrested bases from the Japs in the Solomons . It might be that extended Japanese lines were beginning to feel the strain , that Japanese strength in some quarters was beginning to weaken . But of this there was no certainty . <P> <P> * Last week the U.S. augmented its small Far East Air Forces with new officer talent-46-year-old Brigadier General Clayton L. Bissell , World War I ace and one of the youngest of his rank . His command : the Tenth Air Force , which Major General Lewis Brereton headed before being transferred to the Near East . The Tenth , based in India , may operate also in China and Burma , reinforcing the commands of Brigadier General Claire Chennault.
