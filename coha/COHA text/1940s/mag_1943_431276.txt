 | There 's a general belief that book collectors are old , with long beards and not quite of this world . But one of the most enthusiastic ones I know is a lively young woman . In addition to having collected an exciting lot of murdermystery books , she is married and has three small children . She always will be young , because collecting ? whether it 's books , penny banks , or whatnot , but more especially books ? is fun . And fun is famous for keeping people young . You may think you need lots of money to buy first editions of interesting books . That 's because of the publicity given only to spectacular purchases . For example , when Dr. Rosenbach paid $106,000 for a copy of , the Gutenberg Bible , the newspapers played it up as a dramatic and unique event ? which it was . Yet some of the most interesting and unusual collections are made by thoughtful people with but little to invest . Never have there been greater opportunities for buying cheaply than right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classics . Most of the great modern collectors ? among them , Huntington , Folger , Bemis , Newton , and a dozen others , men who pushed prices upward to get what they wanted ? are dead . Many of their books are again in circulation ? such authors as Dryden , Pope , Johnson , Fielding , and Smollett , who have pleased generations of readers and whose literary value never will die in civilized countries . You can buy them today for a fraction of what their former purchasers paid for them . In 1929 a copy of Dr. Johnson 's famous play , Irene ? the only play he wrote ? printed in London in 1749 , was sold at auction for $200 . A similar copy of this first edition recently brought $12.50 . War and taxes are on the side of the new collector . They contribute to the breakup of many choice private collections . Prices are lower than they have been in the past fifty years . In other words , it 's a terrific bear market , with many a rare book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody can decide for you what books to collect . You may want to collect books about horses , or plays , or dime novels , or just editions of Alice in Wonderland . You 'll instinctively go after the subjects that interest you most . Maybe an author 's style or your curiosity about an epoch or a single event will start you on your way . But whatever the reason , do n't set out for the auction room or secondhand bookshop half-cocked . Buying books is exciting business . A matter of gambling within the law , insidious yet filled with moments of sheer joy . Be sure you know something about your subject before spending . Your local library can be a great safeguard " and guide , and there you should find countless fascinating books about books . The librarian will be delighted to make a list of them i : - you . Soon you will learn t , e " points " of first editions , which are n't always determined by publication dates . You 'll discover hoer necessary it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and certain irregularities I ' type , to establish a book 's histc The wording and design of t- ? pages , as well as publishers ' adye tisements or the lack of them . : c take on meaning for you . You wJ become aware of " half-titles " a " flyleaves . " Learning all this ? a lots more ? you will look at bo. as never before . One of the n : delightful books about books is .1 Edward Newton 's The Amenities Book Collecting , which overni has turned many a calm book lo ? into a rabid as well as avid collect If you hanker after first edit : of great English novelists , why r. start with Dickens or Thacker : I said this to a friend not long e who could n't believe that these famous literary figures were W- : - ? - in his ( Continued on page 1 S @#  | budget . To prove him wrong I took him a sale at one of the auction houses in ew York City . The Cricket on the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for $7.50 . " Looks like 7e cheated the auctioneer ! " he said . I did n't spoil his fun by telling him that had seen Eugene Field 's personal copy Thackeray 's Vanity Fair bring , only e week before , the absurd price of $12. of so long ago such a copy would have tched $500 ! Whether it will climb back that value is anybody 's guess . But it is safe bet that when the world is at peace such books will be difficult to loLte and costly to buy . Certainly there is doubt about the survival of such auors as Dickens and Thackeray . As great ' fists they have achieved permanence id always will have appreciators . Most first editions of these two authors ablished in book form ? they originally ime out in paper-bound parts ? have no ntalizing " points " connected with them . is the parts issued monthly that are are paradise for the bibliographical de.ctive , a role you start playing when you scome a book collector . Take , for finance , Dickens ' Bleak House , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the correct advertisements ad particularly to see if Part 9 has but single illustration and a white slip exLaining that an accident to the other ate had caused it to be canceled and fiat it would be added to the following art . This is the sport in book collecting . TO PROVE it is not only a rich man 's hobby , look at the auction record : In Condon in February , 1897 , a copy of leak House in parts went for 2 pounds , shillings ( about $11 ) . The book connued to advance in value until Febaary , 1929 , when it was sold at auction New York City for $130 . If , by chance , ou had attended another auction held sere in April , 1941 , you would have seen copy of Bleak House described as " First isue , with only one plate in part 9 , and rith the slip relating to the delayed late , " sell for $15 . The same story can e told about most of Thackeray 's first ditions . His superb Henry Esmond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he Virginians , and many others may be ad today for less than $15 . In a - buyer 's market such as this , all ur best American authors of the late ineteenth century are at an equally fanastic low . Imagine ! Some of the best Torks in their original editions of such aen as Longfellow , Whittier , Stephen ' rave , and Mark Twain are selling from 10 down . Would n't any American book aver enjoy owning a " first " of the volume z which these lines first appeared ? " Listen , my children , and you shall hear Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere , On the eighteenth of April , in Seventy-five .... " Veil , it may be had for as little as $5 ! , ongfellow 's Tales of a Wayside Inn was , ublished in Boston in 1863 , and in it you vill find this celebrated poem . But whether you are in New York , Philadel &ia,; Boston , Chicago , Los Angeles , or ust Hattiesburg , Mississippi ? all auction enters for rare books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the original edition . How will you know it ? By the advertisements that have the words " nearly ready " added to the listing of the title . Learning such details of first editions is fascinating business and makes you feel very superior ! Better still , it develops your memory and often starts you off on an intellectually refreshing junket of research .  | Among other American literary treasures that cost little these days if you keep your eyes open for them are Whittier 's Barbara Frietchie and The Barefoot Boy , Holmes ' Old Ironsides , Bryant 's Forest Hymn and Song of Marion 's Men . If the colorful writing of Bret Harte or of the Hoosier , James Whitcomb Riley , appeals to you , do n't hesitate to buy their first editions ? they literally go begging . But not for long . The time is coming , I feel sure , when discerning collectors all over the world , curious to learn more about our background , will scramble to get the works of recognized American authors . If you have faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Eugene O'Neill , and Theodore Dreiser , by all means collect them . It 's true that in the ' twenties their first editions were selling at a premium and that now many can be bought at their published prices and sometimes for less . One of the reasons for this decrease in value is that they were published in large numbers and still are flooding the market . But someday , when the bulk of them is lost or literally read to pieces and the collectors ? many of whom are away soldiering ? come back into the market , these books certainly will increase in price . MAYBE you are a lone wolf , interested in gathering writers whom you discover for yourself , a pioneer like the great early bibliophiles of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries . Such men as Grolier , De Thou , or Perkheimer . More power to you ! They believed implicitly in their own literary taste . So must you . That is how a friend of mine , back in 1923 , started collecting a valuable library at small cost to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris a short time before . Only a few copies reached this country and were selling for $1.25 . Like most collectors at that time , my friend never had heard of Hemingway . But one day in a Chicago bookshop he picked up this little book and was so struck by the freshness of the writing that he bought it . Since then he has obtained all first editions of Hemingway at the issued price . He was pleasantly shocked when a copy of that first item sold at $250 . In playing the book-collecting game , you unconsciously develop three elements that Balzac listed as essential to the successful collector of anything : the legs of a deer , the time of an idler , the patience of an Oriental . Chasing , idling , or watchfully waiting , you are likely to discover enchanting bits of information in many strange fields . Certainly , in bookshops and auction rooms you will encounter " characters " ? men and women also on the hunt for rare books ? who bring color to your existence . You even may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years with someone you will never meet ? all because of some facts you are hoping to acquire or to present to each other !
