THE JUST AND THE UNJUST - James Gould Cozzens - Harcourt , Brace ( $2.50 ) . <P> This story of a three-day murder trial in a small U.S. county seat is as skillfully served up as The Postman Always Rings Twice , and a lot more nutritious . As an unusually natural history of the public and private behavior of lawyers , it is shrewd , entertaining , instructive . As a study of the meaning and function of law and justice in an average U.S. community , especially of the ways in which law and the community interact , it is exciting and complex . But Author Cozzens lacks the daring or the depth to tackle his provocative subject head on . Had he done so , The Just and the Unjust might not have made the Book-of-the-Month Club ( of which it is the August selection ) , but it might have been a major novel . Instead , the book is 1 ) the author 's best work , 2 ) the year 's most interesting literary disappointment . <P> The story concerns the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kidnapped dope-peddler was shot and dumped in a creek . It is told in terms of the legal consequences of their act . Hence it is less a story , in the conventional sense , than a report on a process : the due process of law , as embodied in the performance of some widely different practitioners . There is old Judge Irwin , with his constant concern about motive . He represents the moral salient of his profession . There is Judge Vredenburgh , with his stout attention to hard facts regardless of motive . He is the law 's common denominator . There is District Attorney Martin Bunting , with his faith in the power of pure fact . He is the sort of man who is liable to overestimate the intelligence of a jury . There is Harry Wurts , the rakish , wise cracking defense attorney . Through him Cozzens shows the reader the classic tricks of the trade and the barroom cynicism of the barristers . And there is Assistant District Attorney Abner Coates , a third-generation lawyer , second-rate but competent . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and defendants are little more than stooges for Author Cozzens ' demonstration of how the law works . But the demonstration itself is expert . Through his carefully chosen legal types , Cozzens describes the law as a hierarchy , and justice as a business . As his lawyers make a personal game of saving or destroying the three defendants , as they match wits in the courtroom , rib each other or talk shop out of sessions , Cozzens develops a larger theme-the trial &; error of the law-that check &; balance of competing individuals , juggled fact and eternal compromise out of which rough justice somehow emerges . <P> But here Author Cozzens hits a dramatic snag . Justice , democracy , responsible citizenship are profound in conception and difficult in practice . If their workings are to be fully revealed and their moral roots laid bare , they must be shown contending with profound problems . Author Cozzens ' book poses none . As chronic criminals , his defendants have little moral depth or ambiguity . Toward what little there is , the author is almost pharisaically priggish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical and baffling fare-the tragically irreducible blend of good and evil .
