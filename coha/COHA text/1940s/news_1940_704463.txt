txt The budget which Governor Lehman presented to the Legislature yesterday shows the desire both of the Governor himself and of the legislative leaders to avoid another quarrel over the State 's financial program . The Governor made concessions . He is manifestly not happy over economies which allow patients in State hospitals a maximum of twentyone cents a day for food . The leaders in the Senate and Assembly made concessions , too . They have agreed to resume full State assistance for education and for county and town highways , and to raise an estimated additional $15 , - 000,000 by " steepening the curve " of the income-tax rate schedule . The tax which they have hit upon , in this proposal , might be called a **28;1053;TOOLONG tax . For it is chiefly by this group that the new tax , if enacted , will be felt . At one end of the scale , there will be no increase in taxes for persons with small incomes , since it is not proposed to change present exemptions . At the other end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increase of taxes , but an increase limited in all cases to $145 for any individual and therefore , in the case of very large incomes , an increase which is merely fractional by comparison with present rates . Between these two extremes , however , some very substantial increases are proposed . Two examples may be cited . A husband and wife with four dependents now pay $130 on an income of $7,500 ; under the new plan they would pay $173 ? an increase of no less than 33 per cent . A husband and wife with two children now pay $312 on an income of $10,000 , and would be taxed $431 under the new plan  --  actually an increase of 38 per cent . These are very large and very sudden jumps . They are justified only on the assumption , still to be proved at Albany , that taxpayers in this group are at present greatly undertaxed . The case for new taxes of some kind , designed to raise the $15,000,000 which is the objective of the present plan , rests on the assumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor proposed yesterday . Considering the fact that the total expenditures recommended in this budget are at approximately the highest level in the State 's history , this assumption will certainly be questioned by many . But in fairness to the Governor it must be noted that what he calls the State Budget Proper  --  the State 's own expenditures for current services  --  would show an actui reduction by comparison with last year , if allowance were made for statutory salary increases and larger capital outlays for badly needed hospitals and prisons . The important fact , not widely understood , is that the " State Budget Proper " has now been dwarfed by the item of " State aid " ? that is , by moneys raised by the State but turned over to local communities for expenditure . As recently as 1919 , thi ' item amounted only to $12,500,000 . It has now increased to $145,000,000 ? at which point it overshadows the direct expenditures of the State Government itself . The change has been brought about by steadily increasing pressure on the Legislature to make " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to increase automatically from year to year in snowball fashion . It is a system which easily lends itself to abuse . It tends to conceal the real incidence of taxation . It persuades local communities to believe that they are " getting something for nothing , " whereas they must pay the bill indirectly  --  though not necessarily , of course , in proportion to the benefits which they receive . It takes a large measure of the real responsibility of budget-making out of the hands of the Governor . It creates an ever-present danger that funds which seem to come as a " gift " will encourage extravagance in local spending . A point has been reached at Albany at which the whole system of State aid should be reconsidered in order to determine whether an expenditure which really does not represent either the cost or the work of the State Government is not getting out of hand . Three years ago Governor Lehman himself warned the Legislature of the rapid rise of expenditures of this kind . He expressed the hope Urn that investigation would lead to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the evils and dangers implicit in the present arrangement . " Since then , this chief item in the budget has continued to increase .
