I had been drinking that day . Three of us boys  --  first there was three and then four  --  had been drinking beer up at my house . Then we decided we should go down and shoot some pool . " We were walking down the street and my girl Susan walked up with another fellow  --  one of my friends  --  and called me aside .

One was that he had been drinking in a Brooklyn tavern with chance acquaintances when two of them drew revolvers and announced it was a hold-up . In this version , Donohoe was said to have started for the door when he was shot . Another Version of Story Another version was that Donohoe and his brother , presumably Russell , became involved in an argument with a stranger at the bar and that the stranger shot David Donohoe , whereupon Russell wrested the gun from his assailant and killed him . There was no such ' killing reported here . Lieut . Charles Welch of the Kansas City police quoted a member of the Donohoe family as saying David was driven there by his brother .

At the arraignment , where District Attorney Beldock said Giarraffa had been identified in eight hold-ups , . the youth asked that his case be put over because he wanted to get a lawyer . He was held without bail for a hearing Friday . Grand Jury Hears Girl Mr. Beldock promised a quick presentation of the facts to the Grand Jury for a speedy indictment .

Wallice said he bought two pistols from a veteran and that he sold one for $30 to Matthew Hamilton , 31 , of 34 Liberty Street .
