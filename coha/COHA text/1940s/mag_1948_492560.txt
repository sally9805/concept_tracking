ago in Berea , Kentucky , tapped their heads significantly twenty-five years ago when David Carroll Churchill announced that he was throwing up his teaching job and going into the business of hand-weaving fabrics . Did Churchill think he could turn the industrial revolution around and make it run backwards ? Any fool could see that the machine was king in the textile world ; the hand loom was just a quaint backwoods device whose output seldom found its way into regular merchandising channels . But Churchill had some new ideas about the ancient craft . Today his industrial revolution in reverse is running full tilt . The Churchill Weavers are doing a $500,000a-year business . Other hand-weaving shops are flourishing from New Hampshire to California , and many of their proprietors credit Carroll Churchill with breaking the trail . The machine still reigns in the textile world , but there now is a place in it for the distinctive products of the hand loom . Carroll Churchill was pretty old for pioneering when he started his industrial counterrevolution  --  a man of fifty who had trained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his adult . life in missionary service in India , There was a lot of the engineer in Churchill as a missionary , and there is a lot of the missionary in him as an industrialist . He takes an evangelical pride in what he has done to revive a vanishing American art , putting it on a modern paying basis without compromising its essential character . Churchill had to have more than cold engineering skill to breathe life into his big idea . People in the hill country around Berea  --  the kind he needed to produce fine hand weaves  --  are not easily " naturalized " to modern industry . The big Churchill loom house , however , is carefully adapted to their independent ways . There are no forbidding rows of automatic machines . Instead , wooden hand looms of all sizes and shapes  --  as many as 150 in peak ( C , .. r , ii tttttttt on Pogo 1221 122 f Poe .. : II ) season  --  are scatteredevery which way about , the large , airy rooms . One weaver likes to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look out on t he hills . St ill another faces her neighbor , so they can chat more cozily while they weave . Together they turn out neckties , scarfs , blankets and other goods in such quantities that it . is sometimes difficult to convince buyers that it is all handwork . Individualism is bred in the bone of these mountain folk . It flavors the twang they give to words other Americans stopped using a century ago . It colors the names of many of the places they hail from  --  Beefhide , Mad Dog , Contrary , Viper , Hogskin Creek , Kingdom Come , Hell fur Sartain . The people have n't changed much in the ' 300 years since their ancestors began trickling over from Northern Ireland . At Churchill 's they can get the same pay as in the great textile mills , without the alien machine-age atmosphere . Here the flying shuttle of each loom follows the net ural body rhythm of the weaver . Rhythm is the thing in hand weaving ? rhyl hm not only of 1 he hands but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedals much like those on a pipe organ . The whole co-ordinated series of movements becomes the pattern of the fin. ished fabric . It is a process which leads readily into song , real mountain tunes like Possum up a Gum Stump or Sugar in the Gourd . Or the quaint Elizabethan air that goes : Come all ye fair and tender ladies , Take worn in ' how ye court young men . The verses are endless . They 're woven right into the warp and woof of the cloth . Now and then the looms are pushed back at the end of the day 's work to clear space for dancing . Someone may pull out a fiddle or they may just sing and clap hands to keep time . It does n't really matter . The spirit of the thing makes a mountain jamboree . This free-and-easy atmosphere is not the whole answer to Carroll Churchill 's success . Now nearing seventy-five , he still keeps experimenting in his basement workshop on ways to step up the output of the hand loom . Today he is 123 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done obsolete . It is a foot-power loom in which the rah* Of the weaver 's lintels and feet ere reversed . And the shuttle is activated by a new principle  --  one which may be used in automatic looms too . Churchill 's preoCettim I ion iv it II hand-weaving may seem like a st range destiny for n man who graduated , as he did , at the top of his class it Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1899 . It was an era when young mechanical engineers were making over the industrial face of America . Henry Ford was about to begin the mass production of automobiles . George Westinghouse  --  with whom Churchill spent a year  --  was mass-producing air brakes . Thomas A. Edison was one of ninny who offered young Churchill a job . But Churchill 's dreams were of a different order . He felt a call to dedicate his engineering abilities to the cause of religion . Many of his family were religious workers , and his father was a professor at Ohio 's Oberlin College , a great breeding ground of missionaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post . in India . He did not go as a clergyman . His assignment was not to save the souls of the natives , but to uplift them economically by teaching them useful mechanical trades . Churchill 's orders simply were to set up a school for native mechanics . But he soon saw a broader challenge . lndia 's hand weavers  --  an estimated 30,000,000 of them , counting their families  --  had fallen on evil times . The rise of big-city textile mills was pushing the weavers to the edge of starvation . Could modern engineering principles do anything to save this great artisan class from extinction ' ? Churchill brought all his mechanical knowledge to bear on the problem . It is a problem which has absorbed him ever since . This does not mean that Churchill turned his back on contemporary technology . Later on , in fact , he was to render valuable service as an aviation engineer in both wars . In World War I be contributed a retractable landing gear , an automatic wing stabilizer and some basic features of fuselage design . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arctic Circle , he developed a removable wing cover for military planes based in the frozen north . But no twentieth-century mechanism has ever fascinated him so much as the age-old hand loom . In India the trick was to boost production without mechanizing the looms , for old-line native weavers would starve before surrendering to machinery . First Churchill had to master the weaving art thoroughly himself . Then little by little he began to modify the design of the looms  --  eliminating a waste motion here , putting in a bearing to reduce friction there . With each new twist , output went up a few more notches . The hand loom was being brought up to date , yet never so drastically as to alienate the native weavers . Churchill got amazing results . By 1908 he had developed looms so easy to operate that unskilled coolies could turn out cloth on them four to eight times as fast as expert weavers with old-style looms . British officials were deeply impressed . They urged Churchill toopen a factory for the large-scale manufacture of his looms . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next they tried to persuade him to become commissioner for all industries in Madras Presidency , a job which might have carried a title of nobility . Again Churchill politely declined . With his wife , Eleanor Frunzen Churchill . who was becoming n weaving expert in her own right , tie stayed on at the mission , running his little mechanics ' school and continuing his experiments on the hand loom . In his sabbatical year he traveled around the world studying hand-weaving met ! lode . Then came World War I. In 1917 , wit It his own country becoming embroiled , he gathered up his family  --  which by now included four children  --  and headed home . Churchill plunged into war engineering at an aviation factory , against the day when he could resume his true life work . A good place to pick up where they had left off , the Churchills decided , would be in the southern mountain regions , where people still wove by hand on the crude looms their ancestors had used . In due time the war ended and their chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the physics department at Berea College , located where the Kentucky blue grass leaves off and the hills begin . Berea College went in for a brand of down-to-earth education of which Churchill could heartily approve . Its curriculum aimed at the improvement of living conditions throughout the area . Berea boys and girls did not learn by books alone . They were taught how to make fine furniture , or manage laundries , or grow taller corn . Such skills were intended to make them more valuable citizens when they got back to Marrowbone , Horse Creek , Praise or wherever else they had come from . The college wanted them to go back and spread the benefits of their training among the home folks . It was a broad program , but not broad enough , it developed , to make room for Carroll Churchill 's pet scheme . Missionary organizations did encourage spare-time weaving among the natives as a source of extra income . But there was no thought of revamping the antiquated methods that made tl grandmaw 's weavin 's " so fantastically uneconomical . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were all regarded as adding to the charm . Do-gooders peddled the scanty output in cities much as they would solicit charitable contributions , painting a quaint picture of grandmaw weaving away in her backwoods shack . To Churchill , all t his was sentimental nonsense . Unless these hill people could sell their weaving on its merits and make a full-time living out of it , the art was doomed . As he had in India , Churchill set out . to bring his gospel to the weavers of Berea . He sniffed them out as naturally as a bird dog flushing partridge . The creaking of an old loom inside a mountain cabin drew him surely as a magnet . The natives were suspicious at first . Asa lowlander and a Yankee , Churchill was a double-dyed " furriner . " But . he disarmed them with his talk of strange lands and faraway places , and fascinated them with his prodigious knowledge of their craft . Soon weavers were letting him teach them a short cut or two , and permitting him to redesign parts of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were not won over . They resented Churchill 's interference with the established local way of things . At length the school handed down an ultimatum to the little physics professor : stop meddling or get out . For a man with Churchill 's mixture of godliness and stubbornness , there could be only one answer . He got out , and vowed to show them how wrong they were . He would put his theories to the commercial test , and prove that there was a livelihood in his weaving methods . With his wife he set up shop in a country-hotel room . They started with a single quickly assembled loom . The spools were fashioned from discarded tin cans . Metal parts were picked off farmers ' junk heaps and filed into shape by hand . Working capital was almost zero . Yet already there was a waiting list of customers for Eleanor Churchill 's designs . The Churchills were beginning to attract people who wanted fine hand weaving for its own sake , not merely for its tradition . The little enterprise outgrew the hotel room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loom house . It was just a shed at the edge of town , capable of housing four looms . As the word got around , loom operators began drifting in from the countryside to give this new kind of hand weaving a try . Now the real test was coming . The Churchill Weavers would have to meet a pay roll , and , on a modest scale , the other items of overhead that go into a business . Sales were the crucial problem . No commercial market existed for American hand-woven goods . Eleanor and Carroll Churchill took turns traveling to drum up business . While one spent days and nights in gritty railway coaches and cheap hotels , the other sat at a loom back in Berea and tried to keep up with the orders as they came in . Son Charles , in the time he could spare from his college studies , acted as a mechanic , loom fixer , wrapper and all-around handy man . Meanwhile the running feud between the Churchills and the standpatters went on . The old-line element spread talk that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more weavers were coming over to the Churchill side . At the loom house , the latchstring was always out . Anyone was welcome to come in and look around , and the Churchills were never too busy to take a little time out to show a weaver some new tricks of his trade . Some of the visitors stayed on to work for wages as loom operators . Others became carpenters , mechanics , loom fixers , cloth finishers . They stuck around for a year , or two , or twentytwo  --  many of them are there today . It was a stiff uphill pull at first . The Churchills ' shoestring finances left little leeway for error . The inevitable mistakes of green hands ate into the slim profits . Carroll Churchill 's conatant experiments all had to pay N. themselves ; any major failure would be enough to sink the tiny ship . But gradually the seas grew calm , ' rte Churchill 's sold $17,000 worth of good , the first year . twice that the second year and $50,000 the third . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the first five years . Contractors built new additions to the loom house as fast as Churchill could supply the drawings . Yet as fast as the building was enlarged the business overflowed it . This family enterprise had one Uis. expected asset . Eleanor Churchill turned out to be a born designer . She had a flair for combining colors and textures in striking new ways . Hereto . fore , hand weavers had merely copied traditional patterns . Eleanor Church . ill 's originals were as fresh and new as the lines of next year 's automobiles . Paul Poiret , the famous French designer , called one of her early handwoven scarfs the most beautiful object be had seen in America . Eleanor also had a keen business sense , and blossomed into a one-woman labor-relations department . With it all she somehow managed to look after her household and four children . The years of sweat and sacrifice are all paying off in profits and personal satisfaction . The scoffers who used to . ridicule the venture have long since been silenced . Carroll and Eleanor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good life in a comfortable remodeled farmhouse a couple of hun-. dred yards up the hill from the weaving plant . Charles Churchill , with a family of his own , has a spacious modern home near by . Far beyond the two homes and the plant stretches the Churchill land  --  seventy acres for future expansion . Last year the Churchills grossed ? $500,000 ? small pickings by machine standards , but a whale of a business to ring up by hand methods . Carroll Churchill does not pretend to compete with the big textile factories. , He is no enemy of mass production , . and would not turn back the induetrial ? clock if he could . But there is still a place , he feels , for the traditional American crafts like hand weaving . As he sees it , there will always be customers with a craving for individual workmanship which no machine goods can satisfy , and workers who are . happy only when they have a sense of having created something all their own .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
