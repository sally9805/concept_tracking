txt Gerhart Eisler , German-born Communist fugitive from the United States , was arrested tonight after a struggle aboard the Polish liner Batory , on which he had fled as a stowaway . An inspector from Scotland Yard who made the arrest took the former Comintern agent away from the liner aboard a tender as the Batory lay off Southampton on her arrival from New York . Eisler was locked up tonight in Southampton prison and will appear before a magistrate on a warrant at a special court on Monday . An application will be made for him to be transferred to London to appear before the Bow Street Magistrate 's Court for consideration of an application for his extradition on behalf of the United States Department of Justice . Scotland Yard had been asked by the State Department , through the embassy in London , to detain Eisler as a result of his jumping $23,500 bail to escape serving a year in jail and other penalties . Poles Yield to Avert Delay Polish authorities had originally intended to protect Eisler from arrest . But , faced with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sailing for Copenhagen and Gdynia delayed until 5 P. M. on Monday to allow the matter to be thrashed out , the Poles yielded . Representatives of the Polish Embassy in London protested against Eisler 's being seized by Great Britain for possible extradition to the United States on the ground that he was on a Polish ship . But neither the master of the Batory , Capt . Jan Cwiklinski , who had earlier declared he would not give up Eisler , nor Polish diplomats interfered with the arrest . However , Eisler put up resistance . He was overpowered by four policemen after a struggle . With one policeman at each arm and leg he was carried down three flights of stairs from the captain 's quarters , through the main square , which was crowded with passengers , and down the gangway into the tender . A Polish Embassy official in . London said tonight no statement would be issued by the embassy until after consultation with Warsaw .

Beck , the United States Consul in Southampton , and representatives of the Polish Embassy and Consulate . The officials went to the room near the captain 's cabin and Eisler was brought to them from a cocktail bar where he had been sitting alone . While Scotland Yard officers guarded the door , a three-hour conference was held in which J. Paniki of the Polish Embassy and S. Ziemlewski , the Polish vice , consul in London , protested against the execution of the warrant .

No official statement was made to the 800 passengers as to the reason for the delay . No official of the Foreign Office was available for comment tonight . However , before the news of Eisler 's arrest became known a spokesman said informally that there was a legal right of inspection of ships in territorial waters where there was reason to suspect a criminal was evading justice . He was not prepared to say what the law was in Eisler 's circumstances . " That is something the international lawyers can argue about , " he commented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
