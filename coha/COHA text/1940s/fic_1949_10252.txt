town , made La Azteca their hangout . Yet none of them were there when Delgado got out of Loco 's car and went in the bar to find them . So Loco headed his car out the tree-lined Paseo , and drove to the ball field on the edge of town . In front of the entrance gate , instead of turning off the ignition with the key , Loco reached down under the dashboardand pulled loose a wire about a foot long . He put it in his pocket . " That thieving brother of mine had a key made so he could steal this bug in the evenings , " said Loco . " Now the key does him no good . " He patted his pocket . " This is a great gringo invention from the war . " " From the jeeps , " said the Jank . They walked through the gate in the billboard fence and onto the field . It was empty and desolate except for a few familiar figures in front of home plate . A faded muleta moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet firmly planted , executed the final passes of a grand faena while his friend Pepote Vera bent over and charged him running , holding a sharp pair of horns in front of his head like a bull . Pepote lunged for a last charge and Carlos passed him by his belly with a spinning end figure called a molinete . He finished with style , looking arrogantly over his shoulder , the red cloth wrapped neatly around his thighs , and he held the pose . Pepote jabbed him in the rump with a horn . " Ai , the wasp stung Lupe ! " sang out the Jank . " Pack up the rags , boys . Pepe is taking us to El Sauz . Tonight . " " I 'm sorry you ca n't all go , " Pepe said as they gathered in a knot around him . " Just six . People who have foughtp31in a real plaza . Delgado here , and Loco and me . Carlos and Pepote . And Piki . Say , where is Piki ? " " That cow jumper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To hell with Piki . Anyway , he 'd rather be doing veronicaswith a bed sheet . " " No , " said the Jank , " de frente por detras . " They all howled like wolves . " What about taking me to El Sauz ? " asked Abundio de la O. " Do n't you want to go to Mexico and wait for me there ? " " It would be better for me to go to El Sauz . I can serve you , Pepe . " " Okay , Little O. You can start by going to my house and packing my stuff . We 're going to Mexico from the tientas , so we 'll have to take everything  --  the case with my trajes for the ring , the swords , and the bag with my regular clothes . Loco 's cockroach will look like a troop train . " " Before we go , " said Pepote Vera , " dirty the milk , but Carlos has got to run the horns for me . He owes me . Come on , man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grunted . Nobody liked to run the horns . " Huh , Toro ! " said Pepote as Carlos charged . " A naturalwith the left . Hah ! Another . Huh ! Another so beautiful . Huhh ! See the forced return of the cloth across the chest . Classic , my friends . Ai , Toro ! Do n't cut in like that , you bull of one ball . Huh huh ! Keep that nose bathed in the cloth . Huh ! Now watch . I 'll break his back . I 'll twist him like a string . Take it , bull . Huhhh ! "  | He swung the muleta in a sharp flamboyant afarolado , a red whirl of cloth up and around his head , and saunteredaway with his back to the bull . " How 's that ? " " It will put the musicians to work , " said Loco . " If they 're blind . Let 's go ! " It was dark when he finally came back to the Bello house to pick up Pepe , Abundio de la @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chato had worked on the engine for a couple of hours while Loco and the boys , their capes and muletas bundled and ready , sat drinking on credit and waiting at La Azteca . Their wait was better than Pepe 's , who got very anxious , waiting for Loco to come . While Abundio packed his gear , and stacked it by the street door , Pepe found himself surroundedwith family . Nobody wanted him to leave . Carmelawanted advice about the new purse strings , Rosa 's husband wanted to talk about the towing bill , and the repairs , on the car Alfredo had wrecked . The undertaker came by , with a tombstone carver for Uncle Pedro . Pepe wanted to walk out easy , but he had to run a long gantlet of farewells , dutifully , to his sisters , his in-laws , his aunts and uncles , his cousins . And of course he had to see his mother and tell her he was going away . After three seasons as a novillero , and many leavetakingsfrom Guerreras , there were still scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why he fought bulls , why he could not stay home and enter some nice business , her baby who had been to school , who had been the object of her hopes , who was so promising , whom she loved so much , prayed for so much . It was always awkward and he never knew what to dop33about it . So he would always stand there until she had no more words , and then he would put his hand on her shoulderand kiss her on the forehead and tell her everything was fine , not to cry . He could n't explain it to his mother , why he fought bulls . He could n't explain it to anybody . Besides , an explanation would n't do anybody any good . It was a fever , and he had it . It was not namable , thought Pepe Bello . The fame did n't explain it ; neither did the money . It came from deep down . It made men want to fight bulls the way other men had to climb high mountains or shoot bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to his mother . In the first place , she would not believe it . So he kissed her good-by saying everything was fine ; when he climbed in Loco 's car at last , he felt better . He felt just like Luis lighting a cigar . " Let 's go , " he said . " Listen to it purr , " said Loco , racing the engine with the clutch in , as they turned the corner on the main square of Guerreras . He drove around the bandstand twice , racing the engine , hoping to see his girl , but she was n't there . Four blocks down a side street they pulled up in front of La Azteca . The lights were warm and bright inside . Behind the bar the Indio stood , a dirty white apron spread tight over his vast belly . His gold teeth gleamed as he laughed when Pepe walked in . " Ai , matador , " called the Indio , " take these goats out of here . They are drying up the place and paying nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I want aguardiente . Then this evil meeting travels toward El Sauz. "  | The Indio came to the swinging door and watched the boys pack themselves and their gear into the car . " Make the little cows work , " he called . " The four-footed kind . " Loco attached his wire , stepped on the starter , and nothinghappened . He checked the wire and tried again . The engine was dead . " Try the lights , " said Jank Delgado . Loco flipped the switch and the lights did not come on . The Jank crawled out . " It 's a chort , " he said . " Pile out , lice . Push . Maybe it will run on the generator . " They pushed a block and the engine stayed dead . " Dirt of the apostles ! " said Loco Ruiz , working the choke . Sweating , the calves of their legs aching , they pushed Loco 's bug all the way to Chato 's garage . Back at La Azteca they waited for Chato to fix the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sighing through the emptying streets of Guerreras , but the lights stayed bright in the bar . The phonograph wailed songs of rancheros bereft of love and the golden smile of the Indio floated above the liquor that poured from the bottles into the glasses on his bar . He was a touch for toreros . Indalecio Narbona had tried once in his youth to be a torero himself . He knew all about it . He had entered a ring once . He had cited a bull , saying " Huh , huh " just right , down in his throat , holding the cloth just so . But the bull charged with the sound of a rocket , and the future proprietor of La Azteca forgot what the cape was for . He ran . Safe behind a burladero , his face the color of ashes , he found that his fever to fight bulls had all drained away . It returnedp35slowly , like the color in his face , but changed , sublimated from a desire to fight bulls himself into a worshipful joy in these heroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life to the bulls a step or two removed from their horns , a step behind the barrera , a step behind his bar . In this devotion he gave food and drink to toreros on credit because he loved them , because they fought the bulls for him , always so bravely and well , there in the arena he built in his own simple mind over the well-wiped varnish of his bar . " You would not believe the triumph I had on the third of August in the Plaza of San Marcos , Indio , my friend , " said Carlos Bandera . " It was an apotheosis , like the critics use the big words in La Lidia . I was rabid . You should have seen the way I killed my second bull . One enormous thrust . Like this , profiling , going in , in , right in the highestcrest , right in the eye of the needle . Zaz ! The bull rolled over like a sack , his four feet in the air , and I just stood there smiling , limp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smoke came from the palms of their hands . Handkerchiefs waved . The handkerchiefs were a big white cloud covering the stands while the crowd roared . It was a moment , Indio , when they handed me that bull 's ears . I held them up like this , making circuits of the ring . There were tears in the eyes of beautiful women . Hats and cigars pelted down like rain . " The door from the street swung open hard and Piki Arenas came in , uncertain on his feet , blinking in the light . " Look at that thing ! Look at it ! " yelled Pepote Vera . " He 's been working inside the horns all right . Look how the points pushed him around ! "  | " Hola , " said Piki Arenas . " He got tossed  --  off the bed ! " " He got disarmed . " " How 's your sword , torero ? " " What do the doctors say ? " " Wound of fourteen centimeters in the seam of the breeches . Prognosis at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a syringe or in bed alone ! " " Frill yourselves , oxen , " said Piki Arenas . " Ole for the fathers of purity ! " " Mule collar man , " said Loco Ruiz , " come over and have a drink . Hear how you might have gone to El Sauz with us if you had saved enough of yourself to travel . " " A drink did you say ? " asked Piki Arenas . " Maybe a little taco to eat if the Indio can spare it ? " " Indio , " said Pepe Bello , " this man with the filthy wound does not talk so crazy . Can the kitchen stir up tacos and a few beans for this meeting ? Cash is in my pocket . " " A feast , Matador , a feast . " Not all the patrons , of La Azteca were preparing for a journey to El Sauz . Down at the end of the bar a tall brown customer did not like the noise . He finished off a bottle of beer and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matador . He lives well on the grease from his brother 's collar . " Standing nearest , only Abundio de la 0 heard it . His right hand went into his pocket , and he stepped , unnoticed , to the end of the bar . " Listen , " he said very quietly , looking up into the tall customer 's face , " Pepe Bello fights bulls , not big mouths . It takes no torero to send a mouth to the arrastre . I am nop37torero but I am a friend of Pepe Bello 's . Now you son of a whore , are you getting out of here or what ? " Little 0 looked up and saw it coming . He dodged , throwing up his left arm as he swung around , and the beer bottle grazed his shoulder and crashed to the floor . Before anyone could move , Little 0 lashed out with his right . Pepe and the Jank sprang as they heard the ripping sound of the tall customer 's sleeve . Delgado grabbed him as he groaned ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands before it could swing again . " Put that thing away ! What the hell is the matter ? " Pepe snarled . " I 'm going to kill this big mouth . I do n't like him . " " Leave it ! Do you want to put us in a jam ? " The Indio came around from in back of the bar , worried . " Are you hurt , man ? Let me see your arm . " " This is something for the police , " said the tall customer , watching his arm bleed . His mouth twitched with a kind of silent crying . " Police my ass , " said Jank Delgado , holding him up . " You tried to kill him before he touched you . I 'm turning loose of you now and you are going out that door . Your friend here will take you . He 's going too , by God . Now get out ! " " Abundio , " said Pepe Bello when the door swung shut , " what in the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark . " " Goddammit , what did he say ? " " He made a remark , " said the swordhandler . " Pepe , where is my glass ? " " I want to know what remark . "  | The Little 0 looked at his matador with Indian eyes as opaque and unreadable as two black buttons . " It was just a dirty remark . About me . He was feeling big , and I had to show him . " " Watch it , Abundio . I do n't want you in jail . " " He 's sorry , " said the Jank , whose instincts were sharp and fast . " Come on , it 's all right now . Where 's the Indio ? Hey man , get the sand smoother and clean up the ring out here . Then we might have a drink to go with the tacos . " La Azteca gradually came loose from the moorings that fastened it to a street corner of Guerreras . The plank floor tilted , and spun around . The bar became unstable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in splendid loops of sound that shot from the rubbery horn of the floating phonograph . " Eeeeyai ! " howled Piki Arenas . " I am going to El Sauz . " " W0000 ! " howled Loco Ruiz . " And to think our Little 0 wanted to peel a big tall peach with his San Antonio ! " " Indio , " Jank Delgado was saying confidentially in the noise , " I will tell you . My life is a tragedy . Completely a tragedy . Three seasons as a novillero , starting in my home town Ciudad Juarez on the border , where Don RobertoGonzalez first presented me in his ring . Everywhere triumphs . I was pointing . ' I was a prime figure . Be sure of that . " But then in 1942 I got discouraged . The bulls discouragedme . Their shoulders that season were made of solid bone . They did not die well . They looked at me in a certain way . I got discouraged . A blonde of my home town Ciudad Juarez also discouraged me in 1942 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day I went across the gringo bridge of the Rio Bravo very discouraged and speaking English . On the other side of that bridge I had an insanity . I joined their goddamnedarmy . " Three and a half years , Indio my friend . I fought . I am a veteran of battles you would not believe . You damn right . And what am I , as I risk my fleshes in the army of the North ? Ramon ? Delgado ? No . I am not that . " I will tell you what I am . An officer asks me my professionto write down on a paper . I tell him I am torero and he says What is torero ? ' and then I say Bullfighter ' and he says I ' 11 be damn . Toreador ! ' You see , Indio ? I am of tragic fame . I am the only torero in the United States Army . Named Toreador . You should see me one time , citing a bull of Italy , a dairy bull , with a raincoat . Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am discharged . I take my pay . It 's in dollars and what a package of pesos ! I go home to my Mexico as I have promised myself . I enter again the atmosphere of the bulls . But I have lost something in that goddamned army , Indio . After the machine gun a sword do n't seem so good . I do n't know . " I meet Pepe Bello who is really pointing . ' He likes a sword . He likes an atmosphere of the bulls . He likes me ; so I go with him . I hook the sticks for him , I throw my cape for him , I learn much from old Pancho Perez who is a grand old torero about how to be a good peon for Pepe . The worries go from my mind . But what has happened ? " Am I Ramon ? Am I Delgado , name of my dear Mexicanfather ? No , Indio . I am the Jank , the goddamned Jank.  | The only gringo soldier in the atmosphere of the bulls ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pepe Bello . " The car 's fixed ! Indio , give me the cuenta . I want to pay . " " Diestro , " said the Indio , when he had figured the bill and made the change , " my thanks . My immense thanks . " " Hola the cockroach ! " yelled Pepote Vera , holding open the swinging door . " Now we twist the backs of the cows ! " " Arenas , son of a filth , you got to walk , " said Carlos Bandera . " There is no room , and you ca n't go anyway . You got no peluco . " " Yai ! " said Piki Arenas , climbing in . " I got more cash than a bull can drop in ten grand droppings . Fifty frilling centavos . Besides that , I 'm thin . Move over , garbage ! Indio , if you see my brother tell him I have gone to give lessons to matadors at El Sauz . " " Of course I can drive , " said Loco Ruiz , insulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The Indio stood on the curb , shivering in his shirt sleeves . His apron flapped in the wind as he watched the red glow of the taillight turn the corner down the street and disappear . He could still hear them singing " The Blunt-Horned Steer . " " Juanito , " sighed the Indio to his dishwasher as they were turning out the lights of La Azteca , " there are many ordinary bullfighters , but ordinary people do not fight bulls . " l THE FOUR ENGINES droned in the high Mexican sky . Luis Bello , wearing sunglasses , pretended to doze in his airliner chair ; he was hoping the lieutenant of cavalry sitting next to him would take the hint and quit talking . The air was not smooth . Luis Bello wished he had not taken so much aguardiente with Don Felipe Torres in Monterrey . The last drinks were now up to his collar and tasting too strong . Riding a burro is the best way to travel , he said to himself , about to be sick . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I 'm going to fight bulls in the Capital Sunday afternoon . It was strange to be traveling without the cuadrilla . He was sorry now that he had sent everyone , even Tacho , to Mexico while he stayed alone for the funeral and family affairs in Guerreras . His peons were always with him as he went from plaza to plaza ; they made traveling hardly noticeable to Luis Bello , who felt somehow naked now without them . He had not traveled alone since he was a kid riding the freight trains , fly style as they called it , hanging on the rods going from town to town and ranch to ranch , looking for bulls to fight . That was fifteen years ago . In those days nobody wanted him to fight any bulls . It was a different fly style now , for sure . I would n't have to be listening to this lieutenant if I had my peons . They handle people like they handle bulls for me , they take them out of my hair . I know the trouble with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . People talk too much ; they talk about themselves . This lieutenant , telling me how he loves the festival that is brave , how he has worked a cape at some kind of tienta  --  he 's the public , the type that wants to tell toreros all about the bulls . He 'll brag to his friends that he knows me intimately , then Sunday in a plaza he 'll yell son of a whore at me , and throw things , when I have a bad bull . He 's the public ; I got to be nice.  |p43Of  course , thought Luis Bello as the blonde stewardess walked down the aisle with a pillow , being nice would be so easy  --  with some of the public . But she has a smile like Andres Prieto when he 's scared of his bull and choppingat the horns . A public smile . To her I 'm the public myself . " Some of it comes in a nice package , eh diestro ? " remarked the lieutenant , touching the little hairs of his mustache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can opener , " said Luis . He stuffed the cold stub of his cigar into the ash tray at his side , and leaned back , the aguardiente riding up in his throat . With his eyes closed he wondered if Linda would be at the airport to meet him . He let his mind dwell on how she looked at him , trying to remember exactly how she smiled and what she said when he met her at the party with Raul , the night before leaving for Guerreras . He could not remember exactly , but trying to remember , it gave him a feeling . It was there all right , and it was n't for sale at the butchers ' . None of that stuff . It was the casta , the true ancestry , it stuck out all over that girl . It stuck out pretty , like her name Linda , and it impressed Luis Bello . Like the first time he saw Spanish fighting cows with the glossy curls between their horns . Something for a torero  --  Ai ! He wished he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airport . She might . The engines droned on . The minutes and the miles unwoundthemselves , and the lieutenant talked . The sun went lower than the starboard wing slowly , coloring the windswept clouds over the mountains in the west while long shadows patterned the map of earth below . When the no smoking and seat belt sign flashed on , the map of earth came closer . Then the Valley of Mexico spread out beneath them , mountain-rimmed and magical in the twilight . The familiar dark peak of Ajusco brooding over Luis 's house somewhere down there in San Angel loomed against the sun 's last glow . Across the valley in the southeast far above the dark space of the Pedregal and the dim mass of trees that marked Xochimilco , the white crests of the two volcanoes caught the glow from the west and stood light and ghostly , incredibly high over the gathering dusk in the valley where twinkling city lights awakened . The salty shores of Texcocobelow were pale like snow in the twilight and the waters were black . " Magnificent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded that it was . It was like a dream . The lieutenant was right about something . Bemused in the blue dusk , Luis 's eyes followed a line of lights until the line was lost out in the twisting hills . It was the road to Puebla , his mind told him . He remembered that familiar road when it was not enchanted as it was from the unfamiliar heights of the sky . Like the trip with Uncle Pedro in the dark along that road , the time they drove the herd of Spanish horses . He remembered everything . He could see the drunk colonel long ago , there in the automobile headlights , waving his pistol and cursing the old man who stood by the mare with the broken leg . He remembered how the colonel shoved the gun in the oldp45man 's belly and said he 'd teach him how to drive horses under an automobile after dark . He remembered how the colonel said he wished he had run over a peon instead of a horse . He could still see that colonel putting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brains , and how the old man cried , and the other horses ran away in the dark . It must have been the uncle in the coffin and the uniformin the next seat , made me think of that . All the lieutenant needs is tequila and rank . He 'll be a colonel someday . Well , at least I fight bulls . He felt the plane 's flaps and wheels come down , and his heart beat faster with an excitement he would not have admitted . While the pilot banked to shoot the approach , and while the lights below got closer , Luis swallowed , and ran a pocket comb carefully through his hair . When the wheels touched and rolled along the ground slowing , he thanked Mary Mother of God . " I certainly hope I will be able to attend plaza Sunday , " said the lieutenant as the plane taxied across the field to the terminal . " It has been a pleasure to hear you talk of hulls . May you have luck . " " Thank you , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When the plane swung around and came to a stop they got up and shook hands . Luis stood in the aisle and threw his topcoat over his shoulders like a cloak , turning up the collar . He still wore the big sunglasses ; they marked his profession outside the ring almost as much as a pigtail in the old days before Belmonte . At the plane door Luis was surprised . The blonde stew- ardess spoke to him , holding out her fountain pen and a paper . " Senor Bello , may I have your autograph ? " she asked in English . Luis grinned at her . Now she 's the public , instead of me . " Why did n't you ask me sooner ? " he said in Spanish . Her eyes were very blue . He signed his name slowly , with his rubric jutting down from the final o like a sword thrust . " Thank you for the voyage and the smile . " " I hope to see you in the ring someday . " She had been rehearsing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . " Come Sunday , God favoring , " said Luis , looking at her , laughing . " Your Spanish is fine . " He said " Good-by " in English , and went down the steps . Raul Fuentes , handsome and smoothly tailored , was waiting for him inside the railing by the Immigration desk in the terminal . Linda was n't there . The inspector spoke to Luis Bello and waved him by , while the passengers from the States lined up to present their papers . " Hi , traveler , " said Raul in his familiar hoarse voice . " Welcome ! " They gave each other a quick , easy abrazo . " What goes , Big Agent ? " In the Customs room Tacho the swordhandler was waiting , with his tweed cap in his hand . " Tachito ! What passes ? "  | " Only buttocks , " said the swordhandler , grinning . " There 's your suitcase . Give me the claim ticket . " Luis and Raul started through the terminal while Tacho waited for the baggage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way and nudging each other saying , " That 's Luis Bello . " One of them sang out , " Hola , Luis ! " and the matador held up his right hand and smiled as he walked , with his coat over his shoulders like a cape . " You had a good trip ? " Raul was asking . " Everything all right in Guerreras ? " " As usual . How 's it here ? All lined up ? " " Going good , pal . This 'll be your season . " In front of the terminal the electric lights were getting bright in the blue twilight . A newsboy , thinking fast , ran up to Luis , and held one of his papers in front of the matador 's face . " El Bello ! " the newsboy sang , as if it were part of a song . He pointed to a picture of Luis on the page , holding it up . Luis took it and gave him fifty centavos . He roughed the kid 's hair into his eyes . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the famous matador . " El Bello ! " the kid went off baying . " Your car 's over here , " said Raul . The Buick convertible was sleek and shining in the light . It had cost Luis Bello thirty thousand pesos , a whole corrida , to buy that car . It was bright blue , and beautiful to him , and he smiled to see it again . The boy standing as watchman by the bumper held out his hand ; a coin went into one of his pockets and a dirty rag came out of another , with a flourish . Whistling through his teeth , the boy started to polish a fender . " Never mind , " said Luis . " It do n't need polishing . " " Keep that rag off this coach ! " yelled Tacho , coming up from behind and breathing hard , carrying the heavy pigskintraveling case initialed LB . Luis and Raul got in the back seat . When Tacho had stowed the luggage , he took his place as chauffeur , and headed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all settled now , far below Luis 's collar . He and Raul lit cigars . But the dirt of it was that Linda had n't come . While Raul talked , and the car purred into the smoky edge of town where the poor were cooking their suppers and the street lights cut dim yellow holes in the darkness , Luis sat and wondered how to be casual at inquiring from Raul about Linda . Raul usually knew the score a little too uncomfortablywell . Jesus and Mary , I guess I dreamed it all up . I probably misunderstood ; she probably forgot all about it . And I forgot she 's flower and cream . The bon ton elite . Fly style myself , by God . Born on a dirt floor . I ought to know better . Luis Bello , the sucking calf ! " I 've got you signed for Merida on New Year 's , " said Raul , " and Potosi after that . Antonio is mad of course because you 're all tied up with Valles , but he 's cooling off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toreo later in the season . " Say Luis , I talked to Gomez again about Cuenca on December Fourth . You know , about Pepe and you . You should have heard him when I said you would n't comep49unless he had bulls of Las Astas . He bawled like he had just been castrated . " I found out it 's a festival at Cuenca , on the town 's Saint 's Day , Santa Barbara . I told him he ought to celebrateit right ; that as far as our fees were concerned , we would be reasonable . " Maybe you feel something about Santa Barbara 's Day , Luis ? " Luis Bello wore a medal of Santa Barbara when he went into the ring ; he was silent for a moment , thinking the things he would not say . " It 's just to give Pepe a chance , " he said finally . " Besides , we fight for money , Raul . Not Saints . Did Eladio Gomez call it all off ? " " He finally said he was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bulls would cost . I stirred his sporting blood . He could have some real propaganda for a change : The Two Bellos ! Bulls of Las Astas ! Gala Corrida of the Day of Santa Barbara ! He 'll sell every seat . " " Cow chips ! He wo n't even start by buying any Astas . They cost too much . And he has to have another alternate to appear with Pepe and me . " " He has n't got to that yet ; neither have we . Anyway , he said he 'd call me the first of the week . " " Well , you can kiss that good-by . " " Luis , that filth of a Hector really put it to us for the double truck in the magazine , like I said on the phone . One thousand pesos for Pepe 's triumph ' last Sunday . " " What ?  --  Son of the Mother , for a thousand it should h.  --  a trip to Heaven . On a purple cloud ! Raul , I have fought actual triumphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coyote gets a thousand for one on paper . Listen , we better get another magazine ! " " I do n't want Hector 's bunch mad . If we quit them now , they print damaging remarks . Free . " " The dirty coyotes . They get fat on bullfighters ' blood . And we got to be nice while they drink it . Some business we 're in ! Besides the bulls , there 's everything else . " They came up to Insurgentes on a cross street , and Tacho stopped the car until he could turn left and nose into the stream of traffic headed out toward San Angel . " Did you tell Linda I was coming tonight ? " Luis finally blurted . " Sure I told her , Luis . She already read it in the paper . I asked her if she wanted to come out to the airport , but she said she had an engagement and was sorry . " " Oh , " said Luis . " I just thought I 'd ask about her . She seemed like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly by the Plaza Mexico . Over beyond the unfinished underground parking lot and past the Sports Stadium , Luis saw again the vast silhouette of the plaza curving into the darkness . A lighted billboard at the corner , by the biggest bullring in the world , announcedSunday 's cartel : JUAN SALAZARLUIS BELLOCHATO PALACIOSIt looked lonely and mysterious with only the three names lighted and alive there at the corner . The only sound was the hum of the big Buick as they went by.  | " Old Skinny Salazar , and that young punk , Palacios , " Luis said . " I forgot to tell you who was alternating Sunday , " said Raul . " I knew you 'd like Skinny , even if his joints do creak . Don Tomas wanted him to confirm Chato 's alternativa Sunday , and cede the kid the first bull . " " That Palacios can do just one thing , " said Luis , " a high pass with the muleta , using both hands . It has some emotion , but I do n't know what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that . " " He 's one of the stable , you know . Special promotion . How 's Pepe , Luis ? We got to promote him . He ought to be in there Sunday instead of Chato . " " Have n't I been telling you ? Pepe went to a tienta , to practice on the cows at Don Julian 's . He said to phone him there if you signed him . I felt sorry for the kid . He went to El Sauz with a bunch of his bullring bums from Guerreras . Julian Llaguno will probably throw them off his place . At that , things are sure nicer than when I used to drift around hungry in my shirttail , looking for anything with horns to wave a cloth at . " " That 's one reason you know so much more than these kids . " " Well . A lot of that 's luck . You take Goyo Salinas , my peon of confidence , he knows more about bulls than ten matadors today put together . What has it got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Sunday , when he 's working . Of course I give him a bonus  --  " " That 's a part of the festival . Goyo is like old Pancho Perez . "  | " Pancho Perez , the same . I 'm glad I got him for Pepe . He 'll teach the boy . " " What do you think now of Pepe 's peon Delgado ? " " He 's a kind of clown , and he 's been around gringos too much . But you know , Raul , that boy is smart ? " " No tragedy there . I get tired of the barnyard boobs we see trying to make a living throwing a cape at the wrong time . " " If you mean barnyard , Raul , you mean picador . They were a fright last Sunday ! Most pits should never have left the farm . They do n't know the difference between a bull 's eye and a bull 's ass . I often wonder just which place they will shove that long pole they carry . " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shakes up their brains . " " In that case it do n't hurt a bit . Say , how are the Jackdawand the Little White , my own noble cavalry ? " " You 'll see . They 're probably waiting for you now . " Beyond the Obregon Monument , Tacho turned the car up the slope into San Angel . They drove past the familiar domes of the convent and the empty plaza where the street lamps cast a chalky light on the undersides of the trees . Beyond the Church of San Jacinto the car climbed a steeper , darker way where the smell of pine drifted and the street became a lane flanked by the walls of old houses and gardens hung with bougainvillaea . Slowing to a stop before a big barred double gate , Tacho shattered the evening quiet of the walled lane with a violent blast of the Buick 's horn . The gates swung open and the car went in and stopped by the lighted entrance of the two-storied house in the highwalledgarden . Tacho cut the engine.  | " Back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had opened the gate and closed it came up smiling in the half light , with his hat in his hand . His wife , the fat cook , came trotting around the corner of the house . " Don Luis ! It pleased God to bring you back ! " Four of her children followed her , big-eyed and bashful . While Luis was shaking hands , the whole cuadrilla filed out of the house toward him . " Goyo ! What do you bring that 's good ? Pancho Perez , himself ! And Monkey , how do you carry what 's bad ? Ah , Jackdaw . And here 's the Little White . What goes , Enri-que ? " They all shook hands with the boss . Luis looked around and laughed . He was pleased . " What kind of an evil meeting is this ? Let 's go in and taste a small cup with a cigar . " The cook brought glasses and Tacho opened a new bottle in the parlor , on the table amidst the cards of the game of brisca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photo of Luis dedicating a bull in the Plaza of Madrid . " Luck , " said Luis . " It 's good to be back . Are you ready for Sunday ? " Sipping the manzanilla , they eased down into the modernisticchairs of their matador 's garish parlor . Luis Bello was their master in the plazas ; outside , they depended upon him in a peculiar way . When he was in form , his cuadrilla was a team , and felt like one . When he was not , the team fell apart into single morbid pieces . Each piece was a man without confidence . Even Enrique , the new one ,  | had come quickly into this emotional dependency upon Luis Bello . It was built upon their relationship as master and workman in an uncertain and dangerous pursuit , a pursuitthat made them sensitive to omens because they were all so professionally subject to tragedy ; and it was made complicated by the intimate knowledge they had of each other , living , traveling , working together . The cuadrilla had come out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they each sampled it carefully , like the manzanilla . " How 's your leg ? " asked Goyo Salinas , the senior banderillero . " It 's okay , " said Luis . " Getting well . Any of you boys ailing ? " " No , " answered Goyo . " Except maybe the Jackdaw . He got a little trouble of the heart again . " The seams of the Jackdaw 's brown leather face moved into a grin and he scuffed his big feet on the shining tile in front of his chair . The wineglass looked like a little tubular crystal that might melt any moment in his horny paw . " Eeehoh ! " he said . " The man has had enough of that heart trouble to have a remedy by now , " said Luis . " Have n't you , Jackdaw ? " " The remedy is hard to get at , " said Monkey Garcia . " It 's usually hard , " said Rafael Blanco , the Little White . " Love will find a way , " said Luis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the Jackdaw . " To keep me in trouble . " " These bullfighters , " said Raul , winking at Tacho , " they only think of two things . " " Mostly one , " said Tacho . " They do n't have much time to think of bulls . "  | " What a business , " said Goyo . " We got to go , Luis . We are due at a meeting . " " I never saw more of a meeting than this , " said Luis . " Where you going ? " " The union . It will be a mitin all right . The Rabbit says he wants us peons to protest the management of the plaza at Merida . Maybe close the joint with a strike . " " Listen , Goyo , " said Raul , " I told you we had a booking there on New Year 's . The hell with a strike . " " They wo n't do it . It 's just wind . " " Luis , " Pancho Perez spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask about Pepe . Where 's my diestro ? Is he booked ? " " He 's at the tientas at El Sauz . Raul 's working on some bookings for him . You know how it is . Stay here in Mexico with your family , Pancho , and Pepe will be here soon , and call you . He sent his regards . You 'll be working in all the plazas with him before long . You need any money ? " " Well , my niece  --  " " Here , Pancho . This ought to help until you get busy with Pepe . How 's that picador of his , the Soup ? " " He 's waiting around . " " It wo n't be long . You hold everything . " " Luis , " said Raul , " I have an engagement too . I have to go back to the Ritz . Sure glad you 're home . You want to see Valles tomorrow ? I 'll call you in the morning and we 'll meet . " " I 'm sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , Raul . I 'll take a little supper now , and then make myself some sleep . Tacho , drive Raul home to the Ritz . "  | They all shook hands with Luis again , puffing cigars , and left him in his parlor . He heard them talking in the garden , and asking the watchman to open the gate . The starter on Goyo Salinas 's old car ground noisily and the engine took hold , and when they had gone there was silence . The lonely anticlimax of his arrival bore down upon Luis Bello suddenly . Irritated , he walked over to the radio , flipped it on , and tuned it to music , loud . Standing by a window he looked out into the darkness , drawing on his cold cigar , absently watching the tiny toy lights of traffic moving along the slope of the highway over the mountain to Cuernavaca . The cook set his table , and brought in his supper . He ate without relish , alone . The light over the table seemed too strong to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio moaned that a girl had sinned and regretted ; Luis Bello thought he could still hear aircraft engines , droning in tango time . He was tired , but he wished everybody had n't gone away . It 's no use to call her , thought Luis Bello . She would n't be home ; she told Raul she had an engagement . The hell with her . She 's probably drinking champagne with some Embassy pimp . Besides , I got to face bulls , Sunday . When Tacho returned with the car , he saw the light was out upstairs in his matador 's room . Luis Bello 's leg hurt again when he awoke in the night , and he had disquieting dreams.  |p57IT  WAS ALMOST NOON when Lala brought chocolateand put it on the table by Linda 's bed . " Senora , " said the maid . Her Cuban eyes enjoyed the rich image of her mistress curled asleep in the canopied bed.  | " Senora , shall I open the curtains and let the morning come in ? " Linda straightened her legs under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nestled her jaw in the hollow of her bare shoulder . " Ai , Lala . I was having a dream . " She sighed . " What day is this ? " " A lovely day , " said Lala at the tall French door , pullingthe heavy damask curtains slowly , so that sunlight filtered in , warming the soft blues and grays and golds in the room . The mockingbirds in the yellow cages on the balcony outside were whistling two notes , over and over . " I mean what day , Lala . " " This is Friday morning , the eighteenth of November . It 's almost noon . Shall I bring in the papers ? " " No , no papers . I 'll have my chocolate when I 'm awake . The champagne last night  --  " Linda finally opened her eyes , carefully . The foamy hot chocolate was fragrant ; she turned toward the table at her side . Beyond the edge of the ruffled satin canopy cascading from above her head , the crystal table top bore its accustomedburden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chocolate pot , the fragile blue china  --  and something that brought a puzzled wrinkle across the smooth roundness of Linda 's forehead . By the satin with the silver and china she saw three massive books stacked on her bed table . Their blunt titles were burned like brands upon their raw leather backs : LOS TOROS . " The bulls ? " she breathed , half awake . " My God . " Then she remembered . Luis Bello . I was going to read about toreros and knowp59all about the bulls . Those are the books Raul Fuentes brought last night . They tell everything , he said . What a lot ! They look like dictionaries of all the tongues . " They have beautiful pictures , " said Lala , pouring the chocolate . When Linda had bathed and powdered she sat on a blue divan to read while she awaited lunch . Her honey-colored hair , drawn up high and smooth from the nape and fixed with a golden-headed comb , looked well with the pale blue negligee she wore . Relaxed and languid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs pressing together under the chiffon . Her chin touched the hollow of her neck where the scent of the powder lingered , and when her eyes strayed from the book she held , she looked down the V between her breasts and watched her own breathing . The weight of the book pressed heavily upon her lap . One of the edges was sharp against the yielding flesh of her thigh ; the binding smelled of masculine leather . She found on page 119 in the third volume of Los Toros a formal tauromachian biography of BELLO GARCIA ( LUIS ) . Studying the photographs and the portrait drawing by Cabral that accompanied the dry text , before she began to read the facts of the matador 's life , she decided Luis Bello was a very attractive man . Cabral 's drawing showed cruelty in Luis Bello 's mouth , yet she did not find it echoed in his eyes . A man with a face like that must think barbarous things nevertheless , she thought . He probably did them too . A torero must have an enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the V as she thought of Luis Bello 's mouth , remembering the white teeth . He was undoubtedly barbarous !  | BELLO GARCIA ( LUIS ) , born in humble circumstancesat Hacienda Aguabendita , State of Guerreras , Mexico , October 29 , 1916 . First of a large family born from the union of Francisco Bello , soldier of the ranks in the Revolution , and Natalia Garcia , daughter of a day laborer . Before and after the Revolution , the father was employed as a vaquero on the Aguabendita ; he died of pulmonary tuberculosis in 1928 , leaving the widow in poverty with seven children and an unborn son . From tenderest years Luis Bello , the future diestro , worked as a hacienda herdsman for a few centavos a day . In 1929 the family moved to the City of Guerrerasand came to live with a brother of the widow , a Pedro Garcia residing in the barrio of Los Posos of that city . Garcia was one of the grooms of the famousSpanish horses of Don Angel Pedrazo , haciendadoof Guerreras State . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tending horses . Jaime was a horseman too , thought Linda , but he never tended any . The situation of his family precluded continuance of his studies beyond the elementary grade . He 's never been to school . While delivering horses to the renowned Las Astas establishment of Don Tiburcio Balbuena in Zacalisco , young Bello saw brave bulls in their pastures for the first time , and was present at the operations of a tienta . What he saw fired his imagination . He first dressed in the suit of lights in the diminutive plaza at Pilares de Santa Ana , July 26 , 1933 , during a country fiesta , and was awarded the ear of the first bull he ever killed , forp61his valor with the sword . At a novillada in the plaza of his home city Guerreras , September 24 , 1933 , he was severely gored in the right thigh . The wound kept him from further appearances until June 10 , 1934 , when . . . So many names and dates , Luis Bello ! She began to skip some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle and repeated gorings . He received his Doctorate of Bulls on November 21 , 1937 , at the Plaza de Toros San Marcos in the City of Aguascalientes . . . . In December he went to Peru . . . at the plaza El Toreo in the City of Mexico confirmedhis alternativa on March 6 , 1938 . His first bull , Bandolero of Torrecilla , was extremely brave . . . . Bello buried the sword to the hilt and was awarded ears and tail and a thunderous ovation . . . making a quite with the fifth bull , he was most gravely gored in the left armpit . The horn wound carried him to the door of Death . She wondered what horn scars were like , and if they showed. . . . of 1942 the eminent Tio Curro wrote in Taurino : " The season has made Luis Bello an ace of first category . He is that rare thing , the completely emotionated killer of bulls . . . . he is all a senor and master of his muleta . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No more interestinggift to the Brave Festival has come from the recentexchange of toreros between our country and Mexico than the phenomenal swordsman Luis Bello . His style with the cape is sound , he places banderillaswith the ease of his compatriots , but the real value of his work is his devotion to the Hour of Truth . He brings honor and meaning again to the third period of the lidia in these days of the ballet masters of the red cloth . So technical , and nothing about women. . . . he emerged from his labors in full apotheosis after the award of four ears , two tails and a foot , and being carried to his hotel on shoulders . What a life , Luis Bello . All done in satin trousers ! He called her on the telephone at twenty minutes after five , when she had returned from the hairdresser 's . She used her low voice with a kind of anticipation in it , so that he could hear the rich intake of her breath when she laughed and answered what he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At ten would be fine . Wherever he liked . He did n't ? Well , Ciro 's was clearly very public . La , Luis Bello ! No . She liked Club 123 . Very much indeed . She would be ready .

The handkerchief showing from his breast pocket was very carefully folded , and he was smoking a cigarette . Outside by the driveway gate he helped her in the front seat of his car , and walked around to get in at the wheel . He had n't dreamed it up . Here it was . And that damned Tacho insisting on driving for him tonight ! The hell with thatp63nursemaid Tacho . What if there were bulls on Sunday ? This was only Friday and look at it now !

" " You like the brave festival ? " " To be truthful I have not seen much of it , Luis Bello . We lived so long in the Argentine and Paris and Cuba . Raul Fuentes says you are the best .

I am enchanted . You like being in Mexico again ? " " It 's very interesting to be back . " " I would like to call you Linda because the name fits . " " La . I suppose I should be calling you Don Luis  --  Luis ! " Her eyes laughed at him in the moving lights as they turned into a side street from the Paseo . " I think it 's good enough , just Luis . " On Calle Liverpool he parked the car a few spaces away from 123 , and they walked into the lights under the striped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bello ; he opened the door with a flourish . " Ole ! " he allowed himself to say . " It will be all over town tomorrow , " whispered Linda as they stood waiting for the maitre to seat them . " The same , if we were having barbecue together in Tlalpan , " laughed the matador . " Jabber , jabber . " Their table was in a pleasant unnoticeable corner ; they sat beside each other on the upholstered seat built along the mirrored wall . They ordered coq au vin while a pianist played sentimental gringo ballads from an alcove beyond the chef 's salad table . The dim light added art to Linda 's gray gown and pearls , to her dark golden hair ; she seemed flawless , smiling at Luis . In some way she communicated this flawlessness to him , so that Luis felt he said the right thing , did the right thing , smoothly , there in the dim light with the music , sitting with her , eating with her , talking with her . It exhilarated them both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . It was better than the wine they drank.  | " How did this happen ? " asked Luis , when the waiter had taken their plates and brought them brandy . " Is n't it nice ? " she answered . They lighted cigarettes . " I do n't believe it , " said Luis . But he did . The dirt floor , the bulls , were far away . Linda turned to look him full in the face . " Why do n't you believe it ? " " It does n't happen to me . " " In all the places you go ? With all the fame ? Luis ! kilo ! " " Nothing like this . Nothing . " " Now I 'm the one who does n't believe . " " You should . " Quite suddenly the intoxication , the feeling of intimacy , changed pace . " You 've been in love , Luis ? Been married ?

But Christ in Heaven we all get killed ! Or else die . Just die . " " Oh Luis , do we live any , before that ? "  | He believed she meant it . He took a swallow of brandy ; the bulls , everything , always came back . " You do , Linda . Carai ! " " Jaime did n't love me .

" She leaned on the table with her chin on her hands , looking away , thinking about how to learn to fight bulls . " It 's rare , " she said . " How does it happen ? " " It 's hard to say . You really want to know , Linda ? I 'll tell you . To fight bulls a little worm has got to bite you . He gives the fever .

" Absolutely not , " Luis said quickly . " That 's all we need ! " Linda said when the girl had lgone pouting . The singing band of mariachis that took the pianist 's place changed the tempo of Club 123 . The tenor smiled atuis as they started " Guerreras , The Place Where I Was Porn .

" But you come . Maybe I can show you something . " " I know you will . " " I 'll ask Raul to take you . He can explain it as it happens.  --  " That would be wonderful . " " I 'll know where you 're sitting . I 'll try to put a bull in my pocket for you . " " I 'll probably be nervous .

And here , " with the wave mounting in the yielding trembling softness under the furs , in the dark.  | " And here , " he said when they got to the canopied bed on the satin with the lips and the wet and the hot .

The train should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He should have known better than to travel on Friday . The toothpick he had whittled from a match was chewed to shreds and he spit it out.  |p71For  the hundredth time he took the folded telegram from his breast pocket and read it to look for something he might possibly have missed . He knew it by heart . COME TO LAS ASTAS AS MY GUEST TO SELECT REQUIRED BULLS DISCUSS TERMS HERE CORDIALLYT . BALBUENAHe was too far in the trap to get out now . Yet he had to admit to himself a certain pride . He had never been asked to Las Astas but he was going now . To the greatest bull ranch in Mexico , on business . He fingeredthe yellow paper of the telegram , the final bait to the trap . The wheels on the rails said only click click clack in a tentative way . Five hours late . Powdery dust churned into the chair car . It lined the nostrils , stung the eyes in the hazy light from the lamps over the long dusty aisle . It reduced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them had closed their eyes , trying to doze on the gritty plush , while Gomez sat staring into the darknessoutside . A baby cried somewhere ahead . The train jerked , and the cuspidor sloshed by the empty beer bottlesat Eladio Gomez 's feet . He remembered Cienleguas , passing through it on the trains , on other trips , and it worried him , Cienleguas after midnight . It was one of those stations with a cattle pen and a pump house and a few adobe houses sprawled along a ragged line of tamarisk trees . What if nobody met him ? What if they never got his telegram saying he was comingtonight ? Las Astas was a long way from the station ,  | he knew . Way out in the country . It was twenty minutes past twelve . He folded the telegram again and put it in his he felt the cold and smelled the billow of new dust that rolled in with the louder clicking of the wheels on the rails . He turned in his seat to look back . It was the brakeman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gomez . " Cienleguas " he barked . " By God , " mumbled Eladio Gomez , jamming the brown hat down on his head , reaching for the overcoat and the pasteboard suitcase on the rack over his head , in a great hurry . He set his suitcase down on the thick dust in the vestibule and put on his overcoat , while the train slowed to a stop in the darkness . " Cienleguas ! " said the brakeman again , hopping off with his lantern . Gomez went down the steps with his suitcase and stepped off in the dark . Far up the track he saw the one dim light of the station house , up by the engine . Nothing else . He started walking . The brakeman waved his lantern and the train jerked . Before Gomez had gotten halfway to the station house , the last car clicked by him , shrinking down the right of way , the lights dimming to pin points and then going out , leaving him walking alone . Somewhere off in the dark a dog barked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cienleguas . " Dirt in the milk , " he answered . A cold wind blew the dust by the side of the track . Itp73whipped around his ankles , penetrated his thin rayon socks , worked up his pants legs and under his overcoat . His teeth chattered a little when he scuffed up to the lighted door of the station house . It was locked . " Jesus Christ in all His truth ! " said Eladio Gomez , pounding on the door . A man carrying a mail sack came around the dim corner of the station . Gomez could see the patent leather shining on the bill of his stationmaster 's cap . The man 's shoulders were hunched up with the cold . He was very surprised . " Senor ? " " I came in on the train , " said Gomez . " I was expecting to be met here . Is anybody waiting to meet me ? " " No , " said the man . " Nobody . " " Nobody from Las Astas ? I am the guest of Senor Balbuena . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's where most of them go . Mail , telegrams , the same .

" " Well , for God , can you get me out of the cold ? " The man set down his sack , found his keys in his pocket , and unlocked the door . They walked into the waiting room . " Is there a telephone ? " asked Gomez , looking at the cold concrete benches and the unswept floor . " At the store . It will open tomorrow . " " Is there anybody else around here ? "  | " No senor . Just those sleeping in their beds . It 's late . " " Oh is it ? " He clenched his teeth . " It is possible an automobile will come tomorrow , " said the man , obliging . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Eh ? Senor , with your permission , I will tend the mail . " He picked up his limp sack and went out , closing the door behind him . " Mother of dirt . 0 mother of whores ! " said Eladio Gomez to himself . He looked at his watch . " Four hours until the sun . Four frilling filthy hours . " He was about to throw the butt of his third cigarette , sitting there in the silence with his eyes stinging , when he heard it . First it was a dog , far away , as if it were barking from the other side of the Sierra . And then another dog , closer , and then two others , closer yet , and then a regular nigger-supper of barking dogs out there in the dark brought him to the dirty window at the end of the room . Headlights . He could see them . Then he heard the rumble with the dogs barking , and the rattle and the sound of the motor as the headlights came toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . It was a five-ton truck when it rolled up and stopped . Loaded on the flat bed behind the cab Eladio Gomez could dimly see shapes that made him happy . The truck was from Las Astas all right . The shapes were boxes for shippingbrave bulls . " Senor ? For Las Astas ? " the driver said , getting out of the cab . " Yes . " " Ah , senor , " he said , taking off his vaquero 's hat.  | " Policarpo Cana at your orders . " He bowed his head with old back-country courtesy , and reached for the suitcase . " Eladio Gomez . Much pleasure . " " The hour is late , " said Policarpo when he had gotten the gears shifted and the dogs were barking again . " I feel deeply . I saw the train from the hill . I hurried . " He cut in sharply at one of the dogs but missed . Eladio Gomez was very tired and somewhat confused . The empty bull boxes rumbled and rattled behind them on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobile coach broke itself tonight , " said Policarpo . " I had to bring a truck . I feel deeply . " " The train was more than five hours late . I feel deeply myself . There is n't much at Cienleguas ; I 'm glad you came . " I am glad in all manners , " said Policarpo . He accepted a cigarette Gomez offered him and they lighted up . The cab was warmer and Eladio felt a little better . " How far is it to the hacienda ? " he asked . " Twenty-two kilometers , more or less , " Policarpo said . " A short way , by machine . " He pulled his sombrero down tighter and pushed the accelerator . The truck lurched forward in the darkness , eating the uneven ribbon of the road that turned and twisted ahead white in the headlights , bumping by the thickets of nopal , the dark mesquite in the draws where the dust whirled out under the wheels , and the long rattlingflying stretches through the grass over the hills . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eladio Gomez 's eyes . He closed them , and nearly fell asleep bouncing on the seat with the cigarette burning in his hand . At the top of a rise Policarpo got out and opened a gate , drove the truck through , and closed the gate again . Down a long slope they came at last into the headquarters of Las Astas . They drove in past the dark adobe huts and stone walls , through a narrow lane , and ground to a stop in front of the big house lurking in the darkness behind a courtyardwall . " This way , " said Policarpo , carrying the suitcase . A dog growled at their heels . " Shhuh ! " he said . A roosting chicken squawked from a vine by the wall . The sour fermentedsmell of silage tainted the air . From the darkness out beyond the walls they heard a bull grumbling , deep down in his throat , to himself . The ancient arched doorway to the big house was wide open ; Eladio Gomez followed his guide into the patio beyond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gloom of the battered columns that flanked them as their footsteps sounded on the flagstones around the patio . " The toilet , " whispered Policarpo , pointing to a dark door . " And here is your room . " The door squeaked . Inside , Policarpo groped around above his head , and found the light bulb , and turned it on . The room was pink . It had a venerable beamed ceiling twenty feet above Eladio Gomez 's head , and it was immense . Over in a corner by a small rug was a brass bed with a purple spread , a bureau , a wardrobe that leaned at an angle , and a straight chair . The rest of the vast room was bare . Tacked on the wall over the bedstead was ap77colored calendar lithograph of Manuel Rodriguez , Manolete , the matador of Cordoba . " Manolete , " whispered Policarpo , pointing . " He slept there , in that bed , when he came to the tientas . May God care for him now in Glory ! Good night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pink room , before he went to the toilet . Las Astas . Where they raised the greatest bulls in the Americas . Where a bull cost six thousand pesos.  |p78HE  FELT DRY and brittle when he awoke in the dim pink room and the cold . He dressed quickly , shivering , and took a nip of tequila from the bottle in his suitcasebefore he stepped out into the patio , into a day at Las Astas.  |p79Ruddy  light from the early sun warmed the weathered arches and carved stone tops of the columns on the oppositeportico , but the rest of the patio was still in chilly blue shadow when he stepped down on the flagstones and looked up between the columns at the pale spotless sky . He took a deep breath then , smelling the air tinged with silage and wood smoke , and looked around . Under the portico on the other side of the patio he paused to examine the stuffed head of a black bull looking down on him there . It had a Roman nose , and lacked ears . From somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spurs as someone walked across a stone floor . Then there was silence again . He scuffed his feet , self-consciously , to make a little noise , and he gave an artificial cough , continuing his circuit slowly , peering at closed doors . At the far corner he was rewarded . A door opened and a tall old woman with a brown Indian face and gray hair looked out at him . Her two hands were on her stomach , under her black apron . He had found the kitchen of Las Astas , at least . " Yes senor ? " the woman inquired . " I arrived in the night . A guest of the dueno , " said Eladio Gomez . " Do you know if he is up and if I could see him ? " " Well . He 's up with the first light , and gone out , " said the woman . She made a sign outward with her hand and followed it with her eye as if her patron had gone to the end of the earth . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ask you for a cup of coffee to start the day ? "  | " How not ? " She came out and opened the door next to the one she had stood in . " Enter , senor . Be seated . " He stepped into the dim dining room and sat down at the long empty table covered with checkered cloth . The coffee was black and thick when the woman poured it in the bottom of the big cup and then added the steaming milk to the brim . When he had drunk it , smoking a cigarette , gazing at the ornate crockery on the plate rails , he felt fortified . With his hands in his pockets he sauntered out into the morning where the sun was warming the walls . Peons stood around outside , waiting for their foreman . They lounged by the tall open door of the saddle house , by the truck with the bull boxes , by the sunlit walls , warmingthemselves in the light from the sky , the " stove of the poor " that climbed bright and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sunlight gathering unhurriedly the direction and the desire for the work of the day , while the dew dried , and the horses were saddled . In the west the Sierra rose up pale blue and beautiful , like a promise , above them . " Good morning , " said Eladio Gomez , walking out the courtyard gate . Something in his city dwelling heart expandedthere in the open sunlight . His senses reached out beyond the clay they lived in and found the tidings good . He looked out across the markings in the sunny dust , the tracks of hoofs and paws , the tangled prints of cart wheels and truck tires , of boots and sandals and naked feet , and out beyond the open space he saw the stone pilep81of the bull corrals with their heavy gates , and walked out to examine them . As he came around a corner , three horsemen appeared in the lane under the pepper trees . He recognized the rider on the big sorrel . Drawing closer , the horse pitched forwardsuddenly , answering the spur . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spinning on its hind legs , comingdown facing Gomez smartly as the rider grunted " Ho ! " and dismounted , throwing down the reins . " Senor Gomez ! " Don Tiburcio Balbuena came forward , extending his hand . He was tall , spare , with white mustaches , and he was dressed in tight leather charro clothes , well worn , under a magnificent sombrero with a hat string biting into his monumental chin . " You arrived , Senor Gomez . Now you know where your house is . " His voice was deep and strong as a bull 's . " Eladio Gomez at your orders , Don Tiburcio . " " At yours , Senor Gomez . I feel deeply I did not meet you last night . . . . The lateness of the hour  --  " He walked over and caught up his reins . " This morning we have been cutting out horses for the charro Iturbide here , to take to Michoacan . " He turned to the two riders who had come up . " Iturbide ! My friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gomez , I might mention that Iturbide is the proud and happy father of twenty-six children , at last tally . " " Only twenty-five , " said the charro smiling , shaking hands . " This is my foreman , " said Balbuena , pointing to the other horseman in the crimped straw sombrero and the old rawhide leggings with the iron buckles . " If he will permit me , I will mention that my foreman is a boar hog in the swill when he 's drunk , Senor Gomez ! The Whore of Babylon on Saturday nights . But he knows the bulls , Gomez , he knows them . He has faculties . Tuerto , shake hands with the dueno of the plaza at Cuenca . " The foreman took off his hat , grinning at Gomez with his mouth like a bear trap , and his one eye . " Doroteo Paz , " he said . " Your orders . " " You had some breakfasts ? " boomed Balbuena , looking at Gomez . " Not yet . " " Neither have we , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses . We are going to eat . And saddle one more while we 're gone . Senor Gomez wants to see brave an-imals . " My God , thought Gomez . " We 'll get Serafina , that old cow , to put something on the table , " said Balbuena . His spurs were like bells , on the flagstones . " Serafina ! " They had a tumbler of claret first . Then canned asparaguslaid out on a platter , soaked in vinegar , to whet their tongues ; then Spanish sardines and claret and fried beef and frijoles with plenty of chili and more claret . " You need a foundation to look at bulls in their pastures , " said Balbuena , picking his teeth . " More claret , senores ? " At the courtyard gate Gomez eyed the bay horse the oneeyedforeman had saddled for him . " I did n't bring any boots , " he said.  | " Do n't think of it , " said Balbuena . " El Tuerto has mounted you on velvet , on baby hair . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . " You want me with you ? " he asked his patron . " Come along , " said Balbuena . We might need you . " They mounted and rode down the lane . " Too bad you were n't here yesterday , Senor Gomez , " said Balbuena . " Tonio Algara was here . He drove out from Mexico to look at some bulls for his El Toreo . But you 'll see the ones he picked . We 'll load them for shipping tomorrow . " The sun climbed high and strong in the sky . The horsemenjogged across the grassy hills . " The charro here , he probably does n't know our Brave Bulls , our Toros de Lidia , are greater of family and purer of blood than thoroughbred horses . Do you think he knows that , Gomez ? " Gomez and the charro smiled . " Of course I knew that , " said Iturbide . " We like the stuff with the horns , do n't we ? " said the dueno of Las Astas . " Well armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . " Which points are you talking about ? " asked his patron . " Anyway we like them . Let 's go in this pasture and see the cows . " Tuerto took down the cedar poles across the narrow opening in the mortarless rock walling that divided the pastures of Las Astas , and the horsemen rode through . They found a herd on the slope beyond the spring in the thicket of cottonwoods . Gaunt and baleful-eyed , the black cows lifted their sharp-horned slender heads and snorted at the riders . Their calves jumped from their nursing or from their rest in the shade , nimble as goats , and stood braced on their wiry legs , snuffing . " The old cow at the right , the one with the twisty horns , " said Don Tiburcio , trying to whisper , " she 's the only one left that was dropped in Spain . " At the sound of the voice the cows and calves started away on their spring-steel legs , more like deer than cattle . " You see the heifer turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twenty-seven times she took the iron at the tientas three weeks ago ! Twenty-seven times before she had enough iron in her shoulders . Oh , she will make formidable sons ! Tuerto , the shoulders are healing nicely . " " Don Tiburcio , " Eladio Gomez said , " it would be a privilegeto hear from your own lips how you do things here at Las Astas . " " Thank you , Senor Gomez . Of course you know everythinghere is purebred fighting stock which I originally , myself , brought from Spain  --  the casta of Saltillo , later refreshed with Murube and Pablo Romero . " All the breeding is based on selection for bravery alone . Nothing else . As a real fighting bull can issue only from a brave sire and dam , it follows that everything depends on creating a breed herd distinguished by fighting spirit . To build it , each animal must be tested before it can be placed in such a herd . " That is the function of the tienta , the test for fighting spirit . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at about the age of two years , to charge ap85mounted picador armed with a lance bearing a steel point that is sharp but which can not penetrate to any damaging extent . The animal is then classified according to the fiercenesswith which it charges the horseman and receives the pain of the lance point in its shoulders . " Bull calves are never allowed to charge more than three times , and they are never worked with the cape . This is to keep them unspoiled and innocent when they enter a bullring two years later . " The heifers , on the other hand , are allowed to charge as much as they will ; and they are worked hard with the cape to further test their desire to fight . " I find , for my purposes , about one heifer in five brave enough to join my breed herd , where she will pass her exceptional bravery on to her sons . " Even so , of those sons I find only about one bull in three meeting my standards at the tienta and worthy to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , completely exceptional bulls I choose to retain at Las Astas as herd sires , to mount my cows . These seed bulls must be of the best blood lines and display the most extraordinary bravery at their tientas . After choosingthem , I retest them , to make sure . " The culls ? I sell them to butchers . Or to less particular men who breed them , or sell them to plazas , calling them brave ' ! " The remark made Eladio Gomez slightly uncomfortable . " How do you put the seed bulls to the cows ? " he asked . " I allow them to mount from June to January only , so the calves will come when the grass is good . There is a bull with the cows in this pasture now . Old Cantarillo.  | " A vaquero is assigned to watch each bull , to note down upon paper the branded number of each cow his bull mounts , together with the date . Nine months later when the calf is born , I have not trusted to fences and guesswork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How far does the Las Astas book go back ? " asked Iturbide . " Fourteen generations now . Of course we lack data for the time of the Revolution . In our book we record not only the heredity but the history of each animal , in this order : branded number , name , description , sire , dam , date of birth , tienta date and rating , and if the animal has gone to the ring we note behavior in plaza . With this informationwe can breed selectively . " Around the slope they sighted Cantarillo , in the shade of a tall nopal . His man Teclo sat on a horse , keeping his distance . Cantarillo pawed the dust . He tossed it high over his shoulders , grumbling , as the horsemen went through a gate . " Here the sucking calves stay with their mothers while their brands and earcrops heal , getting strong and learning to eat grass before they are weaned , " said the dueno of Las Astas . " The branding of brave calves is a work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wrestling the fighting devils to the mat . You ought to see it . We throw them on a pad , you know , handling them like angels . Their horn buds must not be injured , nor dirt get in their eyes , to cause defects later . " Now we go into the big bull pasture . " He swept his arm out in a great curve.  | " See it ? Grass , water , and shade . See the bluffs and the breaks down that draw ? Protection . See those hills ? Strength of leg . See those stony ridges ? Hardness of hoof . You see what gives Las Astas bulls their form ? " The sun was past the zenith , hot and bright . Eladio Gomez could feel it burning the back of his neck . His pants legs had worked up so the wrinkles chafed his legs against the stirrup leathers . He could feel the saddle sorenesscoming in his groins and backside . He had not been so happy in a long time . " Here my bulls live from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horses paced through the high grass , " untilI put them in feed lots to fatten for the ring . Two years they live their lives here , untouched . Born of a fierce breed , living the most of their days like ranging wild animals , their power and savagery develops . They learn to use their horns among themselves . " The festival has symbolisms that sometimes strike me , gentlemen . I love the brave bulls . For them there is no coming of old age and weakness and dying fire . No servitude , no toil . Yet we deny them the benignity of reproducingtheir kind . Certain of their male relations will stay home to take care of the cows and carry on the breed with those formidable sacs that swing between their legs . But not our fighters to the death . They are virgins . It is a curiousthing , our festival . " Ah , " he said , trying to whisper again . " Look at them ! We will not talk . Ride slowly , with care . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black bulls had tossed their heads up , gazing at the intruderssquarely with their horns held high , their legs ready . The horsemen reined , stopping . From the distance of forty yards they heard the snorts , the breath plunged from the massive lungs . One bull lowered the horns , backingtwo steps , head down , and pawed , throwing dust . The horsemen stood rooted , facing the bulls . A breeze rippled the grass and carried the dust away in silence . Then a bull blew , whistling the air through his black nostrils , and turned slowly away , stepping with majesty through the grass . The others turned , following . " Precioso ! " whispered Eladio Gomez when they were gone . " Some of the three-year-olds , " boomed Don Tiburcio again . " They will be going next year . There should be two oxen with that bunch , Tuerto . " " The oxen are somewhere close , " said the foreman . " I saw their tracks . " The horsemen rode on . " It is strange , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possible to husband such beasts . The herd makes the tranquillity , the feeling of well-being . Take a bull suddenly from that divided responsibility of herd thinking , make him an individual , and he tries to kill you . " " Exactly ! " said Balbuena . The old man winked . " The symbolism there may be why I prefer the country life ! " " The most symbolical part , " said Gomez , " is the ox . Our castrated friend . Our servant with the empty sac , who is traitor to his kind . We use him to trap the savage bull from freedom , to manipulate him by deceit to where he would not go . " " Clearly symbolical ! " said Balbuena . Eladio Gomez was surprised with himself , talking likep89that . Symbolically . Riding a pacing bay horse in a bull pasture . The sun was down so that their hat brims no longer shaded their faces when they stopped at the old well La Noria under the trees , and drank the cold water , and rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corral . " Along this lane , " said the dueno pointing to the gates along the side , " are the feed lots for the bulls being readiedfor the plazas , the four-year-olds . I give them several weeks of heavy feed to build their weight and strength before they leave . " " You have any trouble getting them to take grain , after bringing them in from grass ? " asked the horse buyer , Iturbide . " Sometimes . They have to be taught . This is done right after their tientas when they are not so hard to handle . They are penned in a lot where there is nothing to eat but cracked corn in individual stone troughs . Most of the young bulls take to it and learn right away . A few refuse . They learn to eat corn from a trough , or they starve . When they are four and come in to the feed lots , they remember . " There is a little bull in a pen back of the house where I have him now , taking his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is a black bag of bones . If he does not eat his cracked corn he will die , and I will let him . Starving or not , at this moment he is as full of fight as any animal at Las Astas . In a brave bull , spirit withers last of all . " " When do you bring the four-year-olds in from the grass ? " " I try to time it so they will be finish-fed , rounded out but not too fat , at my delivery dates during the bullfight season which in Mexico , of course , is from November into March . Late in September I divide the four-year-olds into encierros , groups of six which will go to the same ring together for the same corrida . Each encierro goes to a separatefeed lot , along with a couple of extras , so I 'll have six for sure at shipping time . Bulls kill and injure each other , and they can get sick . " Let me tell you the kind of heavy feed they get in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early morning , another soon now . The total daily ration for each bull is forty-odd pounds . About thirteen of corn , twenty-two of silage , and five or six of boiled frijoles ! All this in addition to what a bull will munch of dry corn stover between feeds . Daily each bull gets a little more than an ounce of saltpeter mixed with his corn , to quiet the natural urges of bullhood . Bulls will masturbate , you know . " Here come the feeders , the only men at Las Astas that work afoot among the bulls . They are rarely attacked , for the beasts identify them agreeably with the bringing of aliments . " A vaquero on a tired old nag preceded the squeaking , tall , two-wheeled cart that came up the lane , drawn by a team of shaggy burros . A driver sat on the cart beside the sacks of cracked corn and the frijole cans , with the soursmellingsilage stalks piled up high at his back . Another peon walked alongside . They stopped by the gate at the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feed was down from the cart , the gate was opened quietly and the vaquero on the old horse rode in . Behind him silently walked the peons carrying feed . Theyp91made four slow trips with their burdens , while the mounted man stood motionless between the feeders and the bulls that watched from among the thorn trees fifty yards away . Silently the peons portioned the feed into the troughs , then filed back to the gate , the horseman following them out as the shielding rear guard . The eight bulls came up to their troughs like milk cows and began eating . A flock of blackbirds from the sunlit tops of the thorn trees flew in by the bulls and hopped around for crumbs . " Pretty ? " asked Balbuena in his rumbling whisper , after the long silence . The bulls looked up ' toward the gate , their ears cocked forward . " You want to go inside where you can see better ? They are gentle while eating . " " This is fine , " said the charro , Iturbide . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastened to the bulls , saying nothing . Oh , they were beautiful ! A peon closed the gate , and the cart creaked down the lane . The sun stood on the edge of the Sierra and the shadows were long and violet when the horsemen rode up to the courtyard . " I 'm dry , dry in the throat , " said Balbuena . " Serafina ! Serafina , brandy and some glasses  --  in my room . " At a rickety card table in his bedroom , the dueno of Las Astas tallied his account book for the day . He wore little steel-rimmed spectacles , penciling in the figures slowly from a paper his foreman had brought him . El Tuerto stood by , with his hat in his hand . Then they discussedtomorrow 's work , while the dueno had a brandy and ate tortillas from a saucer on the spotted table . Gomez and Iturbide sat happy and relaxed in straight chairs tilted against the wall , with brandy glasses in their hands . Gomez gazed at the framed enlargement of a bull photograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines of white lettering at the bottom , " The Noble Bull FINITO of Las Astas . Died by the Sword of Lorenzo Garza at the Plaza El Toreo on Christmas Day of 1935 . " There were tumblers of claret for dinner , and marinated fish in fiery sauce . There was a hard mountain ham from Spain , and fried beef again and more frijoles and stacks of hot tortillas . When Serafina brought in the coffee and Fundador , there were dried sweet pastries in a round tin box from Madrid . " Of course I have been gored , " Don Tiburcio was saying , " but never gravely . " He knocked on wood . " I carry only a scar here on my leg and these three stiff fingers . I have had horses ripped to shreds while I lay on the ground beside them , but nothing serious . El Tuerto lost his eye here at Las Astas , falling with his face in a cactus when a bull knocked over his horse . Most of us carry the marks of the bulls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their first thrusts are not often accurate . They butt and bump and seldom cut meat . In forty years we have had but two fatalities from bulls at Las Astas . Victims are saved by diverting actions , most often by the horses . If a man is mounted and careful , as he should be , accidents are foolish . " Some wonderfully foolish things happen , " the old man laughed , " when a bull gets hot and goes on the prod . About a month ago two agrarians from San Ysidro came over here riding one burro about the size of a dog . A handsometrio , on a visit to relatives . ' I was standing in front of the house when they came ambling across the road.  |p93I  heard Policarpo yell from down the lane , and he yelled loud , Here comes a hot bull ! ' " It had climbed a wall of the feed lot , I found out later . It was really hot , coming around the corner of the corral . When something like that happens , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it means . " I yelled to the idiots on the burro , Get off ! Run for the wall ! ' " The fool in front did n't even turn around . I heard him say , He will do nothing . His anger is not for us . ' " But the man by the tail took a look . He flailed the burro in the flanks and yelled , Oh yes his anger is  --  ' " I crossed myself , seeing the vision of a lawsuit before my very eyes . The donkey and the two passengers all sailed into the air . As the bull ripped the burro 's belly , the front man lying down very flat said to the rear man praying flat on his back , Juan , this bull has anger for us . ' That 's what he said ! " " Yai ! " said Iturbide , slapping his breeches . " What hap-pened ? " " Nothing . They had to walk home to San Ysidro . Tuerto made a fine quite , taking the bull away with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . They led him back to the feed lot . " But handling bulls is no dull way to earn bread , gentlemen . Have more brandy . We eat early and go to bed with the chickens at Las Astas . Tomorrow we ship Tonio Algara 's encierro to Mexico . " " Tomorrow I go with the horses to Michoacan , " said Iturbide . " Tomorrow I take the train , " said Gomez.  | " Tomorrow we find you some bulls for Cuenca , " said his host . " Don Tiburcio , " said Gomez with the supper and the brandy warm and fine in him , " permit me to say I feel the privilege tonight of being the guest of a happy man . " " Gomez , you are kind . " Tiburcio Balbuena fingered his brandy glass . His voice was not so loud . " I am getting old . In a long life I have lost much . I lost my wife , my two boys . I have lost a great part of my patrimony . Revolutions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Balbuena property and I have wasted and rioted much else besides . But I have had luck , Gomez . In all of it I have found more than I could lose . I was born , as the Marques de Bradomin said of himself , ugly , Catholic and sentimental . ' I was also born ready . I 'm still ready . " The old man grinned . " My family furnished the formalities . The common sense is my own . " " And the bulls of Las Astas , " said Gomez . " The festival is brave , friend Gomez , and the bulls are the finest part . Listen . I will tell you and the charro the story of a spectacle I saw with my own eyes in Sevilla when I was young . " The old Conde de la Plata had a daughter . She rode hot-blooded horses and she loved the bulls . One of De la Plata 's herd cows died and left a bull calf starving and the daughter of De la Plata saw the calf and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed that calf for five months . The animal grew big and strong with her care , and was weaned and turned out to grass . " At the tientas everyone wanted to see how this pet calf that showed affection for a girl would charge and bearp95against the iron . The little bull was very brave ; De la Plata classed him superior and pastured him with his best . The bull was savage to all but the girl ; to her he came when she called the name she had given him  --  Caribello . And he ate from her hand . " When the bull had four years the girl pleaded with her father to spare Caribello . But the father refused and this bull went in his box to Sevilla . " And , womanlike , the daughter went to save her bull . In Sevilla she told friends of her family why she had come . The aficion and the bull critics heard of it . The papers printed it . On Sunday the ring was jammed . " I was there . Caribello was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brave . When the time came for the faena , and the matador Antonio Montes brought out his sword and muleta , Caribello was still strong , ready . Peoplebegan to understand they were seeing something . Not the pet of a daughter of a Count , but a noble bull . He gave pass and pass again to Montes : it was enormous . Montes and Caribello . Dancing the strange dance with the scarlet cloth , with Death looking down upon them . " The time for the sword arrived . Caribello stood fixed , tired at last . " The rare thing began . Someone shouted for the indulto , the indulgence , the pardon of this bull 's life . Then the sand of the ring shook , with a shout from twelve thousand throats , for the indulto . " Montes walked to the center of the ring , head up , and looked to the box of the Authority . He received the sign . With the crowd roaring , slowly he put down upon thep96sand first the muleta , then the sword , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted , according to the old and yet very rare custom , the indulto . " But that was not the spectacle . " When the oxen came out to lead the bull away , the daughter of the Conde de la Plata walked down into the ring and held up her hand for silence . A breathless quiet came over the plaza . Caribello , ' the girl called . He raised his head . Slowly she walked up to that hot and bloody bull , and then stroked him between the eyes . The oxen were not necessary . With her hand upon one of his horns she walked Caribello from the ring . " He poured their glasses full and they drank . " The strange thing about breeding bulls is that you never know how successful you have been until a few minutes before your bull dies . The man who has bred a brave bull has bred a quality without measure , a spirit , that may be tested only in the destruction of it . " To get a fighting bull you study blood lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that the right bull mounts the right cow . You watch the little bull nurse his mammy , and you brand him with your mark , and you study him closely when he takes the iron at his tienta . Carefully you tend him , building his size commensurate with the spirit you hope he has . You speak very confidentlyto impresarios like Senor Gomez here , and you sell your bull and you ship him . And it is very possible that after four years of your work and hope and expense , people in the plaza will whistle and throw bottles at your bull that is not brave . " The bulls are a gamble . You hope they will be finep97some Sunday afternoon when they are four , but you never know until that Sunday comes . " Meanwhile , you are grateful . You know the light of morning on the grass where your cattle are feeding . You know the smell of horse sweat and cow pens at noon , and the dry squeak of your stirrup leathers coming down the lane from the feed lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearing your gullet after a ride . " You know the long slanting afternoon light that makes the thicket of nopal seem so high above the old spring where the calves are bawling , and the water ripples going down to the corn patch . You know the smell of wood smoke at dusk when your cowboys sing going home to supper , and always you are hearing the talking of your bulls . " You know the fun at the tientas ; and the strong feeling that comes up in you , there with the crowd , when your hull comes out of the toril and charges the men resplendentwith crimson and gold in the sunlight . You belong to an ancient art . It is an art that speaks to the hearts of men who understand violence . It is , " said Don Tiburcio Balbuena , " a thing for glory , and to stir the multitude . " That night , asleep on the bed where Manolete once slept , Eladio Gomez in his dreams saw the most majestic bull in the history of the world . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sliding under the fine-haired glossy hide . The short head was narrow at the nose and wide at the forehead where sharp and smoothly tapered horns sprang outward , then forward with upward tilting curves . The weaponed head was drawn up proudly on a massive neck where a crest of muscle , swollen into a hump , joined with a curve of brutish power into the deep shoulders . The line of the back was concave in connecting those shoulders with the high rounded rump , and the flanks were slick . The hindquarters were all rippling muscle ; the lower legs were light-boned right down to the small sharp hoofs . There were glossy curls between the angry eyes and the silky tasselof the tail touched the ground . Upon the left hip was burned the brand of Las Astas , the mark of Tiburcio Bal-buena :  | THE DRIVER GOT IN , started the engine , and moved the truck forward slowly , inch by inch . " Hold it ! " yelled Policarpo from on top of the bull box at the end of the truck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely moving.  | " Stop ! " Policarpo signaled the driver to cut the engine . " One more now , " said Balbuena , standing by Eladio Gomez . The truck had moved into position so that the last box stood squarely at the mouth of the loading chute . Policarpo reached down and pulled up the sliding gate on the near end of the box . When it was raised , squeaking up its grooves , the inside of the box formed a fitted terminal to the chute . Policarpo kept his station behind the raised end gate , ready to lower it at the proper time . The box he stood on was exactly like the other three on the truck . Built of almost a thousand pounds of wooden planking reinforced with iron straps and lined at the forward end with iron plates to keep bulls from shattering the planking with their horns , each box was a standard eight feet long , six feet high , and thirty-two inches wide . Trap doors were cut in the end gates for handling feed and water , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The three loaded boxes on the truck were queerly alive . They shook , creaked , and thumped with the blows delivered against them invisiblyfrom the inside where in each one a bull pounded with raging hoofs and horns . " Ready ! " Balbuena shouted . He and Gomez took up their stations on the masonry ledge built along the outside of the chute where they could duck down out of sight , or raise their heads to see over the wall . The gate to the trap at the far end of the chute opened silently , manipulated with ropes handled by two peons lying flat on their bellies atop the wall at each side of the gate , and three belled oxen trotted into the trap lead/ing and flanking a black bull . When they had led the bull in far enough , the oxen circled away and headed back out of the half-closed gate where the foreman El Tuerto , mounted on horseback , whistled softly to the oxen , cleverly speeding them out , leaving the bull alone , shut in the trap , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . The bull 's great neck muscle swelled and he bellowed , pawing the dust and scouring , furious with the sudden solitude and stillness . Shut within the high stone walls the bull searched for some hint of movement , some target for his horns . The target appeared suddenly . Up the chute near the box Tiburcio Balbuena lifted his head above the wall and swung his arm over the top , shaking his hat at the bull . " Huh ! Toro ! " The bull charged through the chute after the lure , snortingand hooking at the hateful movement of the hat  --  and ropes pulled a gate shut at his tail , trapping him further , his head almost inside the dark box . Without allowing the bull a pause , Tiburcio Balbuena reached over the top of the chute with an electric prod pole in his hand . He jammed it under the bull 's tail , pressed the button , and with the shock the bull gave a wild snort and lunged involuntarily forward into the box . " Now ! " thundered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grooves , scraping the top of the bull 's tail , hitting the hocks as they plunged while the gate came down all the way and latched into place . " Ho ! " said the dueno of Las Astas . He was smiling . " Another encierro . All safe . We had good luck this morning . " He turned towards the corrals where heads had appeared from behind most of the walls . " Well done ! " he boomed out . " A good faena ! " Policarpo climbed down . The bulls were jarring the boxes , plunging and bawling ; he walked around peering up at the ropes and wire that fastened the load on the truck bed . " When are you leaving ? " Balbuena asked , coming down from the side of the loading chute . " As soon as we eat , " Policarpo answered . " I will mention your responsibility again , " Balbuena said . " As mayoral you have complete charge . Keep the trucks in sight of each other all the time . You ride in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know how many pesos are in those boxes . Take care of them . You ought to be in Mexico before sundown tomorrow . When you get to El Toreo you tell Morenito to unload you immediately . Send the trucks back Tuesday morning ; you stay , and see that the bulls are cared for exactly the way we would do it here . Be there when the vets make their examinations and watch the scales when the bulls are weighed . Remember you are responsible for the animals until they come out of the toril Sunday . Do n't get drunk in Mexico . You 'll hear from me later in the week . " " Yes , patron . " Policarpo got in the cab . Balbuena and Gomez waved as the truck lumbered down the road . One of the bulls was bellowing . Balbuena sat down on the ledge by the chute in the bright sun and wiped the sweat from his face . Gomez lit a black tobacco cigarette . They were alone . Gomez knew what was coming next , and tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me what you have in mind for your corrida , friend Gomez . " " Well , " said Eladio , drawing a breath . " Don Tiburcio , as you know , my plaza is modest . The corridas there are the best I can afford , but the box office is limited . I am forced to practice economy to keep my enterprise sound . I seldom pay the high fees currently received by ranking toreros , nor can I afford the kind of bulls great plazas buy . " " I understand clearly . " " The season at Cuenca usually opens on the Fourth of December , as the main feature of the festival of our town 's patron , Santa Barbara . This year I thought I might make that first corrida something special , if I could manage . I am about to sign Luis Bello as First Sword . " " Luis Bello , " Don Tiburcio said . " A real torero , and my good friend . He 's in the Plaza Mexico this afternoon ; we 'll listen to the corrida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Las Astas : he came here as a boy herding horses . The bay you rode yesterday , Gomez , is out of a Pedrazo mare Luis Bello drove to Las Astas . To be honest , I do n't remember him then . There were so many kids wanting to wave their shirts at the bulls . But I do remember the Bello uncle , an old man with spurs on his sandals . He delivered the horses . Luis is in the grand tradition all right : his people were hungry enough ! He has fought many bulls from these pastures  --  " " He wants Las Astas bulls at Cuenca , Don Tiburcio . Iwant them too  --  " Gomez added . " That 's why I came  --  " " You ought to have them . Who 's alternating with Luis ? " " He wants his kid brother Pepe on the card . " " The kid , eh ? Who else ? "  | " Nobody yet . And if I get Las Astas bulls , I ca n't afford six of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raise the price of seats for a gala festival on the Saint 's Day . " " I 'm afraid of that , Don Tiburcio . Circumstances  --  the people of Cuenca , they  --  " " Then what you are thinking is this : a mano a mano , a hand to hand , between the two brothers . And only four bulls . " " What do you think of it ? " " Well  --  why not ? A short one . But quality not quantity . Something special . The Great Swordsman of Guerreras with bulls of the first class from Las Astas . What 's wrong with that ? " " The only thing is the kid . Pepe . That part do n't seem so strong . It 's no mano a mano because it 's no heated competition . " " Luis insists on the kid of course ? " " That 's it . " " Go on , Gomez . You know Luis will put on a show . You know that . And the kid will be trying . Trying hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the public remains , shall we say , somewhat cynical regarding Pepe Bello . He will be trying , with good bulls . And the two brothers together in the ring will give a color , a certain interest . " " The Cuenca public is hard , Don Tiburcio . " " The public anywhere is hard , my friend . It 's a gamble . From my standpoint , from yours , from the toreros ' , from the public 's , it 's a gamble . Everybody risks something . Whether it 's the price of a back row seat on the sunnyp105side , or death on the horns , everybody has to risk some-thing . " " It 's the only thing to do , I guess , " said Eladio Gomez . " I 'm going to take you out now and show you some bulls for the Bello boys at Cuenca , " said Balbuena . " I have something in mind . " Out at the feed lot they leaned with their chins on their hands , looking over the high wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulls in the enclosure , so that they stood up , alert , in the shade of the huisache . " I will take the two reserves from this encierro , Gomez , and two from another . You understand that these are absolutelyNumber Ones . I will show you the book when we go to the house . Write down those numbers , 74 and 107 , and we will check their ratings in the registry . " " They are wonderful bulls , Don Tiburcio . But I ca n't pay the price you get for them at the big plazas . Have you got  --  " " I have something in mind , " said the dueno . " Now let 's look at the other pair I want to show you in the lot down the lane . " The peon got the other encierro up , throwing more rocks . " Ho ! Toros ! Ho ! " One of the bulls in the enclosure stood out from all the rest . His horns were good , turning slightly toward each other , like parentheses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matched in size and line with the other bulls . But he was ugly . He had a marked Roman nose . Coarse hair grew under his jaws like a beard , along the brisket , under the belly to the pizzle . And the tassel of his tail was missing . He was a whiskered , bobtailed bull.  | " What 's that one doing in there ? " asked Gomez . He sensed the impending offer . He understood now what Balbuenamight have in mind . " Listen , " said Balbuena . " That nose and that hair are just one of those rare matters that crop up in breeding . There is nothing wrong with that bull , Gomez . Unfortunatelya coyote nipped the end of his tail off when he was a calf , and left him rabon . But I gave him four stars at his tienta . I 'll show you in the book . Number 23 . Write that down . You can see he 's the amo , the master of that encierro , now . I 've had my eye on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torero . I say he is a Senor Toro ! " " People expect something different from that , wearing the green and gold ribbons . No , Senor Balbuena ! That buffalo would make people laugh and then get mad and throw things ! " " Senor Gomez . That bull is out of the best cow at Las Astas . He will give a torero worth the name a real time . The horns are nice to work . Look at them . Turned in just right . " " With the whiskers and that rabon ? No , senor ! Begging your pardon , it is a cartoon of a bull . Like the funny papers . " " All right , Gomez . Look . Granted I ca n't sell Rabon to the big boys . They say he 's ugly . All right . I say I like the bull . I say he will wear my ribbons very well . You are looking for four Number One Las Astas and  --  if we must be brutal a moment  --  you can not pay what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer . You take the bobtailed bull along with three other Number Ones , and we will dop107business . I 'll give you that Number 37 , the pretty one by the wall , to go with Rabon . " " How much ? " Gomez asked . He was sweating . " What do you offer ? You know the worth of the bulls . " " Well  --  " " For four selected Number Ones I can get above twenty thousand pesos in the Capital this season . What can you afford ? " " Nothing like that , Don Tiburcio . " " All right . You take the bobtail . What can you afford ? " " Fifteen thousand ? " Gomez asked . Tiburcio Balbuena broke into a laugh . " Gomez , the devil sits on the shoulders of hagglers . Take the bulls for sixteen thousand . " " I 'll take them . " Gomez had to laugh then himself . " That bug without a tail ! " " That 's a bull . You wait and see . Of course the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 'll see . Thecrowd wo n't laugh long . They 'll forget the whiskers . " " You 've settled it , Don Tiburcio . " " Good . Now . I want to find Tuerto and have him put your four together so they 'll get used to each other and not cause injuries in the pens at Cuenca . " Sitting alone on a bench in the courtyard sunlight , waiting for his host to return , Gomez probed at the work and the worry he saw ahead , promoting the half-born corrida . It was hard to wait until he could notify Raul Fuentes , to get that signature on the dotted line . He wished it were train time . If the Bellos refused a mano a mano with the four bulls . . . well . . . that would be the fat pearl in the crown ! That would chill him . He was glad when Don Tiburcio walked into the courtyard . Gomez had not seen the parlor in the big house . He was surprised it was there , when his host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The radio 's here ; I ca n't move it because of the antenna attachment into this window , " said the dueno . " It 's about time for the corrida . Serafina is going to bring refreshments . Except for the broadcasts , I seldom use this room . " He extended his arm as if in explanation , indicating the oil portrait over the mantel and the two large elaborately framed tinted photographs on either side . Gomez understood by the gesture these were portraits of the wife and the sons Balbuena had lost . He nodded , and said nothing . The rest of the room was a dusty museum of tauromachia . Gomez noticed first the dim crimson and silver wallpaper with its design of garlanded plazas de toros and its beribbonedbright instruments of the lidia . Up toward the ceiling , extending around all four walls , was a papered frieze of matched hand-colored lithographs by Daniel Perea , a hundred scenes of all the pageantry of a nineteenth-century corrida de toros . Hanging on the walls were stuffed heads of bulls with engraved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by braided silken cords of green and gold . There were elaborate banderillas with sharp barbs and dusty satin flowers held by ribbons to the wall . Two picador 's lances and a picador 's wide beaver hat were fastened above a torero 's rose silk cape draped on the wall by the scarlet wool of a muleta formally folded over the blade of a matador 's red-handled sword . In the corner by the door was a great silk rosette lettered LAS ASTAS in gold ,  |p109with  wide satin streamers of green and gold hanging from it almost to the floor . A long double line of photographs stretched along one wall , action scenes in bullrings , pictures of bulls , autographed portraits of toreros . The radio sat on a scratched old library table by tall stacks of bullfightmagazines , and chairs upholstered in worn , torn leather , and a tall brass spittoon . " Enormously interesting , " said Gomez . " No , " said Balbuena . " It 's a warehouse . There 's no one to tend it . Before the Revolution this room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capes held in place by the polished horn tips of Las Astas bulls . There were Moorish rugs and the furniture was carved with bulls and gilded in Sevilla . On a night in 1915 bandits threw everything into the patio . They had a bonfire . No , Gomez . You see only remains . Some souvenirs accumulated since those days . But all the great figures have been in this room  --  Bombita to Manolete  --  all of them . " Serafina brought in the manzanilla rack , loaded with food on the compartmented wooden plate that formed the base around the tall bottles in the center and the circle of thin cylindrical wineglasses . " Help yourself , Gomez , " said the host , pouring two glasses of manzanilla and starting to eat . " It 's good . " With the cool wine they ate creamed goat cheese and tortillas , spiced mountain ham , cold fried anchovies and little green olives soaked in lime juice , and they poured more wine . " You know how I saved the casta of my brave bulls when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the story ? I loaded my great seed bull , Flamenco , and eight of my best cows in boxes . I armed my people and we hauled those boxes on wagons , fighting , in the night , all the way to my father 's old house in the city of Zacalisco . We tended those animals in four bedrooms of that house in town with mattresses hung in the windows to keep out bullets , for fifteen weeks , and by God we kept the casta ! Your bulls , Senor Gomez , come from animals we fed in my family 's bedrooms long ago . " Gomez had another glass of manzanilla . " Ai ! What time is it ? " Balbuena asked . " We 're forgettingthe corrida ! " He turned on the radio . " What stationdo you get it best in Cuenca ? " " XEW , " said Gomez . " The same out here , " said Balbuena , twisting the dial so that the red needle pointed straight up on the kilocycle band . " Don Verdades is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blare of sound blasted out at them . " Ho ! " Don Tiburcio shouted , as if the radio were a horse . He turned the volume down , tuning. "  --  and , there go the third pair ! Served by Monkey Garcia fast and badly placed , " the radio said , intelligibly . " That 's it ! " Balbuena said . " We 're late . They 're nailing banderillas . " The two listeners lit cigarettes and settled back in the leather chairs . " Luis Bello has the sword and the rag in his hand now , he 's coming out . He walks over and looks up to the Judge , and salutes the Authority . He will now make the dedicationof his bull , the third bull of the afternoon here at Plaza Mexico . "  | " We are really late , Don Tiburcio , " said Gomez. "  --  the dedication is to an individual . Ah ! It is to Bello 's manager and friend , Senor Raul Fuentes , sitting in the first row . I beg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Senor Fuentes . The dedication is to a beautiful young lady sitting next to Fuentes . A very beautiful girl . She is smiling . She catches the matador 's hat when he tosses it up to her . Bello is now walking around the barrera to face the bull , which has taken up a position near the toril . " Bello is citing the bull with muleta in right hand . There ! No , no . The bull did not follow ! Bello chopped with the rag from horn to horn . He is having difficulty adjusting . Now he tries again , approaching , for a twohandedpass with the cloth held high . There ! But a very mediocre high pass . The bull does not turn for a repeat . Luis Bello is trotting after the bull . There is some whistlingfrom the crowd . " This is very dull , friends of the radio audience . Bello is angry . The Swordsman of Guerreras has not shown us anything yet this afternoon . He has not shown his usual feeling of domination . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk . There is more whistling . Loud remarks from the sunny side  --  " " Bad ! " Eladio Gomez said . " The bull wo n't charge past him , " Balbuena said . " He 's sweating a bull made of lead . " " Friendly listeners , " said the voice on the radio , " Luis Bello has just made two inconclusive passes with the right hand , and has continued chopping at the horns . Bello is being intelligent and discreet with a difficult bull , but his work is without spirit . The crowd demands more . Bello has given up the idea of developing a faena . He is trying to square the bull for a sword thrust . There is whistling and booing . " The sword hit bone ! It 's still in Bello 's hand ! He 's squaring again , mounting the sword . Oh ! Bello is having a bad time ! He hit solid bone again and the sword bent and whistled into the air . He 's disarmed , the muleta is hanging on the horns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Bello is at the barrera taking another sword and rag . He 's sweating ink . " " Fiasco , " Gomez said . " There ! " said the radio voice . " Bello has delivered half the blade . It is on the bias . It is not sufficient to bring the bull down ! There is a strong demonstration arming against Bello from the sunny side . There is a scandal of cushions and whistling . Bello is attempting to sever the spinal cord at the base of the skull with a descabello . One jab . No good . Another . 0 ladies and gentlemen ! The Plaza Mexico is the scene of a near riot ! " The roar blurred the broadcaster 's voice . " At last . " Balbuena and Gomez heard it with difficulty . " The ninth intent to descabellar is successful . The ninth ! The bull is dead , the mules are coming out . The demonstrationcontinues . Bello is walking very slowly now , across the ring . His head is down . I see tears on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are making arrests of demonstrators in the stands . The monos are clearing the cushions from the ring . " " Holy Mother , " Balbuena said . He filled his glass . " Butp113they all have afternoons like that . They all have them . It starts with something very small , and once it 's started , the devil builds a monument . Imagine that funnel of fifty thousandscreamers pouring their venom down on you , flooding your brain . " A gloom descended upon the impresario of the plaza of Cuenca . Luis Bello would be a savage this week . He would be a son of filth to deal with , signing a contract with a fiasco still in his teeth . He might not come to Cuenca at all . He might go into a slump and be terrible even if he came to Cuenca . Gomez looked up at the bull heads , the bull pictures , the bull business , that surrounded him , and he thought of sixteen thousand pesos , and he hated the bulls . He wished he owned a grocery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regular Sundayafternoon chronicle of bulls from the Capital of the Republic , sent to you for your listening pleasure over radio station XEW . " It happened suddenly during the fourth bull . Skinny Salazar had been the soul of caution , the competent old craftsman on tired legs , working his last animal of the afternoon , for money . The glory for Juan Salazar was past and no longer necessary to him ; Don Verdades droned the period of the cavalry , the period of the sticks , and now , the period of the blade . Salazar was making a pass with the sword and muleta in his right hand , a pass he had made ten thousand times , when the bull got him . The tone of Don Verdades 's voice jerked Gomez and Balbuena up in their chairs . " Sacred Name , the bull has Salazar ! Ahh ! Ai ai ai ! Oh , friends ! Ai ! " The voice was silent . The static popped and crackled . Balbuena jumped up and turned the volume knob , waiting , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the static crashing . " Ladies and gentlemen , " the voice resumed , trying to control itself . " Friends . This is Don Verdades at the Plaza Mexico . I will try to recount the tragedy just witnessed by the plaza . Juan Salazar has been gored , horribly gored , by the fourth bull of the afternoon . They are carrying Juan to the infirmary . His blood stains the sand , stains his clothes . He appears unconscious . " Ladies and gentlemen . Salazar was intending a low pass with the right . It is impossible for me to say at this moment the reason for what occurred : the bull cut in from his charge and the right horn caught Salazar in the right thigh , tossing him . Before intervention was possible , the horn found Salazar again on the ground , and again . At least ten capes were at the rescue . It was very confused . I believe Salazar 's swordhandler pulled him from under the bull while a cape was over the beast 's face . Someone had the bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give details at this time , ladies and gentlemen . Salazar is now in the infirmary . This announcer will give you full word from the operating room at the earliest possible moment . Stay tuned to Don Verdades , XEW . " Balbuena and Gomez were standing , looking at each other . " Luis Bello , " continued the radio , " whose cape was prominent in the rescue , Luis Bello has muleta and sword , is walking out to kill the Salazar bull . The bull has a wet horn , ladies and gentlemen . The horn is red . Bello is squaring , mounting the blade . There it is ! Now we have the greatp115Swordsman of Guerreras ! A tremendous lunge in over the horns , ladies and gentlemen . An enormous volapie by Luis Bello ! A revenge by Luis Bello . The bull is dead ! A terrible drama . Bello stands over the beast . Bello has thrown the muleta on the ground ; he is walking to the barrera , wiping the blood of the bull from his sword hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it came with the static to the two waiting listeners at Las Astas . It recounted without excitement the regular progressof the fifth bull toward death at the hand of Luis Bello before an unresponsive , almost silent plaza . " The crowd is not seeing the ring . The crowd is imagininga white room under the plaza . It is waiting for word from under the bright lights in the white room , " said Don Verdades . Young Chato Palacios was placing a pair of banderillas on the last bull of the afternoon , his bull , when the word came . " Attention ! Attention , all Mexico . Juan Salazar , beloved veteran matador of Teotihuacan , is dead . He died in the infirmary of the Plaza Mexico in the Capital of the Republicapproximately three minutes ago , as a result of wounds suffered at the horns of a bull in this afternoon 's corrida , reported to you by Don Verdades , radio station XEW . The name of another glorious martyr is now inscribedon the golden catafalque of the brave festival ! Juan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rest in Peace , Juan Salazar , torero . " The loud-speakers at the Plaza Mexico boomed and rattled above the voice of Don Verdades on the radio . The crowd was not interested in watching Chato Palacios finally kill his last bull on the day of his doctorate , in the center of the world . " I 've got to get the train tonight , " Eladio Gomez said to his host . " The train to Mexico , not Cuenca ! " " We 'll get you to Cienleguas in time . I think I 'll go with you , Gomez . To pay my respects to the remains . Salazar sat in this room many times . I did n't think the bulls would ever get him . He was n't the type . The public will make him a hero now for a couple of days while they bury him , after making him a cynic while he lived , past his day . Dying on the way down . " " I 'm wondering about Luis Bello , " Gomez said . " My corrida. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd was jammed too tight to move . A squad of soldiers guarded the infirmary door , blocking and shovingwith their rifle butts , trying to hold back the flood . Police blew their whistles around the edges of the packed mass of the crowd , ordering , pleading , threatening without any effect on the morbid mob . It was too big to put under arrest ; the police were angry . At the dense rim of the crowd by the cuadrilla gate that led from the ring , Luis Bello and Chato Palacios with all their toreros pushed and swore at the packed backs that blocked their way to the infirmary door . By tradition , and by their own deep desires , the toreros owed an appearance in the infirmary , now that the corrida was over , now that the bulls were all dead . Juan Salazar was dead too , and they could not get to him . The police were helpless , trying to clear them a path to where Juan Salazar lay . A wailing chorus of sirens moaned down the ramp from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sirens , and the sound ripped into the enclosed passageway blastingat the walls and racking at the mob . Ringed around a black hearse in the dim light the motorcycle police plowed into the side of the crowd . It fell back upon itself stumbling , shouting , melting in front of the wheels that would not stop but slowly rolled with the sirens screaming like doom 's approach , to the infirmary door . " They 're getting him out , they 're taking him away ! " The crowd swirled like a wave lifting itself and lapped around the white-sheeted stretcher swallowed by the black hearse doors . " No use now ! No use ! " Palacios shouted in Bello 's ear . The sirens screamed , the motorcycles popped , the exhaustsmoke fogged the dim passageway as the hearse plowed through the other side of the crowd , carrying Juan Salazar away from a bullring for the last time . " Now break it up , you bastards ! " roared the police ,  |p119charging  . " There 's nothing more ! Get the hell out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd broke in pieces . The sirens were screaming yet . Caught in the drift of the backing mob , the toreros were pinned and surrounded in the passageway , and the crowd turned its curiosity and its remarks upon the trapped cuadrillas , sweaty and mussed in their soiled satins and bloody glitter . Luis Bello heard the phrase in the crowd and heard them laugh , " The Axman of Guerreras ! " " I 'm tired of this , " Luis Bello said between clenched teeth . " But not too tired to show you , you herd of filth . Gim me one of those swords , Tacho ! Open that case and gim me one of those estoques . Open it , goddammit ! I 'm going to kill me a few dirty filthy lousy bastards that like blood ! I 'll give you some blood , I give you some blood out of your own dirty whoremother hearts that like to see blood , " rasped Luis Bello , grabbing at the sword cases under Tacho 's arm . Goyo Salinas held the matador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the police . He was bareheaded and white-faced . " Let 's go , Luis . Let 's go home , " Raul said , putting his hand on Bello 's shoulder . " Let 's go . " A cordon of police escorted the bedraggled procession to the outside gate . Swordhandlers ' assistants lugging loaded cape baskets and empty water jugs brought up the drooping rear . No one said a word . The Bello cuadrilla climbed in Luis 's car . " Thank you , Chief , " Raul said to the captain of police , handing him something when he shook hands . " That mob of  --  "  | " Infamy , canaille ! " said the policeman . " Thank you , Senor Lawyer Fuentes . " " You go with them , " Tacho said to Raul . " I 'll drive Goyo 's car and bring the stuff . " He gave Raul the key to the Buick , and Raul got in at the wheel . The sun was down behind the mountains when the crowded car got on the boulevard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were heavy clouds behind the dark peak of Ajusco . A wind swayed the tops of the trees along the parkway in the fading light . When the Bello cuadrilla fought in Mexico they dressed for the ring at Luis 's house ; afterwards they always returnedtogether to San Angel where they could bathe and change to their street clothes again . On evenings after triumphs , friends and fans swarmed to the house where Luis held open court with his cuadrilla , accepting congratulationswhile his callers rehearsed his exploits to each other and prolonged his triumph . It was different after an afternoon without luck . The fans went to pay court to a more fortunate matador then ; or if they were confirmed Bellistas , they went home glum , to wait for another day . Only a faithful few would come to offer their comforts after a gray afternoon in the plaza . But this evening as Raul drove up the narrow lane there were cars and a crowd by the gate to the matador 's house . Tonight Luis Bello was no hero ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if possible , morbidly , and to mourn with . When Luis and his men got out of the car in the garden they were surrounded . Stiff and sore , with the sweat drying cold on their silks , they wished for no company , neitherp121mourners nor enthusiasts , but they had them . Luis allowed a few of the faithful and the influential to embrace him , but he answered none of their words . He felt numb and gutless now that he had quit trembling with his rage . His jaw muscles worked as he walked into his house . Tacho came driving Goyo 's car into the garden ; the watchman lifted out the cape baskets and the swords . He had a score of anxious volunteers to help him take them to the house . Raul Fuentes skillfully assumed the public relations of his shaken matador . Upstairs , with no less skill , Tacho drew a hot bath and got Luis Bello 's hair unfastened from the black velvet button of the pigtail pinned on the back of his head ; got him out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black band on the left sleeve , the spangled vest and the sash and the wrinkled satin tie , the skin-tight glittering taleguilla , the stained embroidered shirt , the dirty pink stockings , the gritty white sox , the long sweaty underwear , the shining silver medals of La Virgen de Guadalupe and Santa Barbara from around his neck . Luis Bello got into the bath where his flesh seemed to melt outward away from him in the hot water , pulling the tense knots out of his flat empty belly , away from his arms and his legs floating in the heat , dissolving the knots out of his shoulders , and finally from the inside of his tired skull . He felt better when Raul came upstairs . " Raul , I never even noticed . What in hell did you do with the girl ? I forgot . " " Some people took her home . The Galvez Ramiros were sitting next to us . They took her ; I went to find you . Listen , you ought to get out of this house now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet us there after they 've eaten . Then we 'll go out to Salazar 's , all of us . You better stay with me at the hotel where I can block the fans and the phone calls until after the funeral . It 's no good being around here . Everybody can get at you and make you nervous . There are two reporters downstairs now , more coming , and everybody seems to think the idea is to cry . Tacho , you can handle them here ; I 'll handle them at the hotel . We wo n't tell anybody where Luis is . " It was raining when they drove into town . The windshieldwipers clacked and the water whished , thrown by the wheels on the black shining streets , in the silence . There was no talk . Raul hunched over the wheel , intent on driving . Luis sat with his hands in his trench coat pockets . He had an unlighted cigar in his teeth . The newsboys were screaming the name of Juan Salazar in the rain , along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobby desk in the Ritz , Raul left strict instructions . He was not in . Luis Bello was not with him . They ordered dinner in the room . On the day of a corridaa torero never eats a meal until his work is done ; Luis Bello was usually ravenous after an afternoon in the plaza . Tonight , as he sat at the table the waiter brought to Raul 's rooms , the food stuck in Luis Bello 's throat . " Can you give me a brandy , Raul ? I 'm not hungry . " The cuadrilla knocked on the door about ten . They were feeling better with food under their belts . They were beginning to look back on the afternoon more professionally , with less emotion . The Jackdaw was limping . " That goat of a second bull , " the Jackdaw said . " He jumped like a goat . "  | " He knocked you off like a goat , too , " said the Little White . " Why did n't you start with enough stick ? " They discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody mentioned the third bull , nor the fourth . Damp and crowded together , they drove out the wet streets that led into the Colonia Roma . The mass of the city seemed drawn into itself , huddled in the dark with the rain beating down . The modest parlor of Juan Salazar 's rented house was dimly lighted and jammed with people when Luis Bello and his men came in out of the rain . The guests in the dead man 's house smelled of damp wool and alcohol as they crowded together talking low . An uncle of Juan Salazar led Luis alone into another room where the women of the house sat weeping with black veils over their faces. " 0 how did it happen ? " Juan 's mother asked herself aloud . She did not expect an answer . It was simply a refrain for her grief . " He never regained his senses . His tongue could not shape a last word for those who loved him . " " I did not feel it when Juan went away , " said his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and silver . I did n't know . " Juan Salazar 's three small children were in the room with the women . The little boy said to Luis , " A bull killed Papa . " Luis groped through his mind hunting for some words . He did not find them . There was a kind of embarrassment joined to this suffering ; there were real tears in his eyes and he wished there were none . " Juan was , Juan was my friend , " he said to the women.  | " I came to tell you . If you need anything . If I can help . Ask me , senoras . If you need anything . " The undertakers brought the body a little after midnight . Juan Salazar 's swordhandler came with them . He had just dressed his matador for the last time . In a blue serge suit . Tonight was the end of his matador , tonight was the end of his own career . Nineteen years in the plazas and the bulls finally got Juan . The swordhandler 's eyelids were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a metal stand , lifting it over the doorsill , then placing the stand with its burden in the center of the room . An undertaker brought in four tall candlesticks and arranged them on the bare floor at the four corners of the coffin . He fitted them with high white candles , and when he lit them the flames cast a new light on the crowded faces all turned and fastened on the long black box . There were many kinds of faces . Most of them had looked out upon a thousand sunny afternoons when the bands played and the applause was loud , but now the candlelight leached that from them , took it all away , left only the ends of those afternoons when the darkness came . Garza and Silverio were there ; Fermin Espinosa with his brown bony face , by his brother Juan , and fat Don Felipe Mota . The Briones stood together ; Gregorio , Chucho , the old Tiger of Guanajuato with his forelock in his eyes . Valles looked down over the shoulders of Ochoa and VasquezAlas with Luis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembering a coffin like that ; the Algaras and the Madrazos flanked Chimo , who remembered Linares and a grave in Cordoba . Rivera , Manolo , Castro . Carlosp125Rojo looking bitter . The kid Chato Palacios and Luis Bello with Raul Fuentes and the cuadrilla and a waiter from the Tupinamba . Whatever they all felt for and against each other , whatever feuds or friendships burned for them in the sunlit plazas , the candlelight now did not reveal . The hungry faces of bad luck , the tired faces of mediocrity , the well-known and the obscure faces of adversity , brutality , loyalty , and everything else written from the human heart and the horns of the bulls , were crowded to the corners in Juan Salazar 's parlor . A priest made the sign of the cross and said a Latin prayer by the coffin ; the undertakers opened the lid to show Juan Salazar 's face , under glass ; the women of the family cried aloud coming up to the bier to see their man who was home again . The face was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ever . It was too pale and too quiet . Juan Salazar did not look as if he slept , either well or poorly . Juan Salazar looked dead and it did not matter how he slept . Juan Salazar had gone , leaving some clay . Valles placed a great bouquet of red carnations at the feet of the clay . It was raining harder than ever when Luis and Raul drove back to the Ritz . " I had to get out , " Luis said . " Father Jesus of the Great Power ! I had to leave . " " Sure , Luis . You had plenty today . Plenty . " " It 's true what they 're all saying , Raul . If the bulls can get Skinny , then nobody 's safe . Nobody . He knew the answers , so many years . It shows you . It do n't seem right , the bulls getting Salazar. "  | " How did it happen , Luis ? His back was turned to where I was sitting . What really happened ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It blew the muleta back , and the bull did the rest . It caught him unlucky . It just happened . It happens a thousand times out there on the sand , and luck takes care of you . Then it happens one more time . " The headlines were black with the name of Juan Salazar on all the newspapers at the desk in the Ritz . " Remember I 'm not in , " Raul told the clerk . " Send up all the papers when I call in the morning . " " I do n't give a damn what the papers say , " Luis told Raul when they were in Raul 's rooms . " I did what I could . " " Everybody knows that . If anybody thinks different the hell with them and their mothers . " They undressed by the twin beds . " I want to know , Raul , what did Linda say ? I knew I should n't have toasted that frilling glue-footed ox to her . I knew it when I did it . I knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she say , Raul ? " " Do n't worry about it . She felt terrible , on your account . She knew you were trying , do n't worry . " " I thought I could make a faena anyway . I could n't . I toasted her a fiasco . " " Quit worrying , Luis . There 's plenty more Sundays when things will be different . " " It wo n't take many more Sundays like this one , senor mine . " " Quit worrying . Go to sleep . " He turned off the light . " Salazar died broke . His family has n't got nothing . "  | " Juan was never the torero you are . " " He was pretty damn good . Raul , I want to be smarter with the money . Will you help me be smarter ? A real program . I 'll listen . " " You 'll do all right , twin . Sure I 'll help . If you 're serious . " " I 'm serious , Raul . This do n't last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Knock off that . Go to sleep . " " The horn was wet right up to the hair . It was red and sticky . " " For Christ 's sake , Luis ! " " Meat for the bulls . They say it about me . They always have . " " What the hell do they know about it ? " " Who knows ? " " You know , goddammit . Get to sleep ! " " I do n't know , " Luis Bello said . In the morning the rain rolled down the windowpanes and it was very gray . " We wo n't do a thing today , " Raul said . " We 'll hole up . Thank God the funeral is n't until tomorrow . Look at the rain . " " They 'd have to bury old Skinny like a sailor , " Luis said . " In the ocean . Let 's order up some breakfast . I 'm hungry . " " I 'm glad you are , " Raul said . Eating their breakfast in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they had finished , there was a great litter on the floor . The press bulged with the tragedy of Juan Salazar . The sob sisters even brought the weather into it . They said the heavens joined Mexico 's mourning and wept for a brave torero . Luis looked mostly at the pictures . Esto carried seven full pages of corrida photographs , including two blurred views of Juan Salazar dead in the infirmary . Luis did not read much of the text detailing the afternoon . Big words gave him difficulty ; his reading was painfully slow . He left that to Raul . They lit cigars and the smoke hung in lazy layers in the closed room . " The critics were fairly decent , Luis . They should be . They gave no prominence to the third bull . Everything is a flood of tears for Salazar . After the way the poor devil has gone begging for corridas in wooden plazas lately ! " " They like a torero better when he 's dead . Oh , how they love to mourn , feeling no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the corrida yesterday is more or less forgotten . You do n't lose any cartel , or very little , over that third bull . They forgive you with that sword thrust you made on the fourth . " " The coyotes make me sick , " said Luis . " There 's some lousy pictures of me here offering the apple to that third ox . " " But the stuff about Salazar , " Raul said . " They dig their tripes out , hanging the crepe . They shovel it . Listen to this : Rather than eulogies , than poems , than ballads on the streets , may this torero who has gone from us receive in simple farewell that sweetest of prayers for the eternal rest of his soul : Our Father Who art in Heaven  --  ' Here 's another one : No torero of the highest summits , no favoritep129child of the Goddess Fortune , Juan Salazar yet bathed himself in the sweat of afternoons of triumph . He was a brave one amongst the bravest in a festival that calls itself brave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim of his valor ; he fell a victim of his honor , lest he leave a plaza cheating the fans , many or few , who paid for a ticket to see him . Yesterday afternoon he gave a pass with his muleta to immortality ! ' " " He fell because there was a little wind and it caught him unlucky , " Luis said . " He gave a pass with his muleta to the infirmary ! Where we all go , with Doctors Ibarra and Rojo de la Vega looking down at us . Raul , it may be this festival business has no surplus of valor like it says there , but it 's got enough bullshit . Plenty of that . Poor old Skinny ! We got to order a wreath for him . The biggest damn funeral wreath ever made . " " You 're going to save your money , Luis . You 're serious . " " I 'm serious all right . But I 'm not starting on it until after this wreath I 'm talking about . I want them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . FROM YOUR FRIEND LUIS . All written with flowers . " He picked up the phone and called the house in San Angel to tell Tacho to order the wreath , right away . " The best , " he said . Tacho asked if he had received the long distance from Sain Alto , Zacatecas ; he had referred the operator to the Ritz . " No , I have n't got it , " said Luis . " That must be Pepe . Look Tacho , if you want me for anything , make the operatorring this room . " Luis clicked the receiver to get the hotel switchboard.  | " Did long distance call me from Zacatecas ? Well , if they do , I want the call . " He hung up and turned to Raul . " Pepe , I guess . He probably listened to the corrida . " " He 's probably anxious about his bookings , too , " Raul said . " We ought to be hearing from Cuenca . Eladio Gomez . " " Still hooking at the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whack . " Luis sat down and relit his cigar . He did not feel as well as when he first awoke , and he settled back in the overstuffed chair , staring at the blue smoke from his cigar . The rain outside made a discouraging sound on the windows . His eye caught idly at words on the newspaper near his feet . The words formed slowly in his eyes ; their meaningand import slowly came into his mind . The words were under a cut of Juan Salazar at the moment of his goring . They said something about " the destiny of toreros who go on fighting one more time . ' " It sounded like a hell of a thing to print about Juan Salazar . About anybody . Luis Bello knocked on wood . " It 's dead around here , Raul . Makes me nervous . Let 's do something . Is your radio working ? Let 's go some-where . " The phone rang . " For you , Luis . " Pepe Bello was calling from El Sauz ; Luis said yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was poor and the brothers had difficulty hearing each other . " Sorry about the corrida yesterday , Luis . That 's bad about old Skinny . "  | " Very bad , " said Luis . " What you doing ? You coming down here ? " " You got any bookings for me ? " " Not yet . " " Then I 'm going back to Guerreras . " " Why ? " " A cow stepped on Loco . Broke his collarbone here at the tientas . I 'm going to take him back home in his car . " " Ca n't you kids stay out from under cows ? What you trying to do ? Milk them ? " " No , fight them . Loco lost . We nearly died laughing . " " Fighting cows is a losing game , kid . Specially from underneath . Ole ! When you coming to Mexico ? " " Jank and I and Abundio will be there the end of the week . Tell Raul for God 's sake I want a corrida . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to Guadalajara Sat-urday . " " I 'll see you when you get back from there . " " Stay out of trouble . " " You too . Luck , Luis , for next Sunday . I want a booking , tell Raul . " " He knows it . See you , boy . Keep off the horns . " Luis put the phone on the hook . " I owe you for that call . Damn kids ! They have the fun . A cow stepped on one of Pepe 's pals and broke something . Pepe 's taking him back to Guerreras . Raul , let 's get out of here . Let 's go downstairs and sit in the bar and see people . I got to do something . Today makes me nervous like being in jail . " They sat at one of the low tables around the corner of the bar , where Chucho the waiter brought them beer and roasted pumpkin seeds . In twenty minutes there were twenty men around the table , and the crowd grew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came gallopingfrom the battered tables of the Cafe Tupinamba a few blocks away , to sit in the red leather seats of the Ritz Bar and get a story . Most of them had been to Salazar 's house earlier in the morning . Old Skinny would not have believed it , they said . Crowds were pouring into the short street in Colonia Roma thicker than the rain , invading the house of the dead matador , to view the remains . They were about to wreck the place . There were fifty policemen out there . It was a scandal . Now the press was anxious to know everything Luis Bello thought and felt about yesterday 's tragedy . Everything . How about a firsthand account of his part in rescuingSalazar from the horns ? Could he explain the goring ? Could he please take off the sunglasses for the photog-raphers ? " I had the bull by the tail , twisting , " said Luis Bello . The flash bulbs popped . " We did everything we could . " " How about the public yesterday ? Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those things , " Luis Bello stated . " Very variable . The public is like one of those toyhouses with a little old woman that comes out and pointsto Fair ' while it 's raining oceans . You ca n't tell about thepublic . One day it whistles and hoots , the next day it wantsto kiss you and carry you around with flowers . The oppositeis just as true . Three left-hand passes with one de pechocan put the public in your pocket . The same passes  --  when you do n't make them  --  can put you in jail . In thep133case of Juan Salazar he makes one pass which puts him in Heaven . The public likes it fine . The public makes Juan a hero . The bull makes Juan dead  --  " " Say , " Raul Fuentes broke in , " do n't write it like that . You know what Luis means . " " Sure they know . The public 's as hard as a mountain ham . It takes a hell of a lot of knife to slice it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It makes great demands , which a torero 's honor supplies . Put it like that . " " Yeah , " said Luis Bello . " Print it like that . We all eat off the ham . " A half hour later the crowd around the table was thicker than ever , and Luis was finding less and less to say . The talk in the bar had the flavor of the pieces in the newspapers . The crowd handled the big words and the big thoughts the way they handled the beer and pumpkin seeds . Sitting in the middle of it , Luis felt farther and farther away . It was just as bad as being alone . Maybe worse . It was worse . " We ought to be going , Raul , " Luis Bello said . " We got a lot of things to do . " " Well , " his manager said when they were alone in the car on the rainy street , " I told you it would get you . What do we do now ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bull crowd that warms the seats and stands behind the barrera gives me the pain . The great pain . They talk bigger and braver than any bull or any bullfighter that ever lived and a two-year calf would scare the Jesus out of any one of them . Maybe they think they buy the balls they lack by buying tickets to a plaza . Maybe it 's what a bullfighter gets paid for : to sell a brave feeling to a man who lacks it and has to buy it so he can talk about it like it belonged to him . I never thought much about it before . I been thinking a lot since that damn trip to Guerreras . The old uncle got me . Now Salazar . I been thinking too much . Let 's go out to the house and have Pomposa make some chili . The fire like I ate when I herded horses and did n't think . Hot enough to dry this rain . Hot enough to burn rust from this ass ! " The cook made enchiladas for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . The friends who came to call joined the matador and Raul Fuentes at table ; together they wore most of the afternoon away playing conquian with the taurine cards marked in suits of swords and cups , tambourines and banderillas . The twelve of swords was a painting of Luis Bello . It brought him no luck , but a bottle of tequila capped and carried along the heat from the enchiladas , and the parlor was a cosy fortress against the fading gray light at the windows . The radio played music . Raul came back from a trip to the telephone in the hall and touched Luis on the shoulder . Raul was smiling . " Luis , that was Gomez . He 's got your bulls ! " " What bulls ? No ! You do n't mean the Cuenca Gomez ! " " He 's got ' em . He wants us to sign . " " Must be something queer , Raul . It 's the end of the world ! " " Number Ones , from Las Astas ! " " How do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . He 's been to the ranch . Don Tiburcio came to Mexico with him for the funeral . He said we could ask Don Tiburcio what 's going in thep135boxes to Cuenca . Gomez says he 's bought four . For a mano a mano between the Bello boys ! No third alternate . And now , a booking for Pepe Bello , matador de toros ! " " Wait a minute ! I 'm not going to any Cuencas until I find out more about this business . " " You will . I told Gomez to come on out here now . We 'll see old Balbuena tomorrow . You 're signed ! " The radio was playing a new ballad , the announcer said , " The Tragedy of Juan Salazar . " Juan died at duskIn the gloaming . When the day was dead So was Juan . They took him from the plaza . It was empty . The wind blewAn Ole of gray ashes and then the rain Washed everything away . " Turn that goddamned thing off ! " Luis Bello said. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of air . Just the dark air all around and in the middle the island where it was completely warm and easy not to move or see or try but only feel how soft and smooth and still it was being alive and tired , so tired , and easy now upon the island without eyes.  |p137And  then the black ocean shaped away from nothingness . Waves and tides and currents grew within it , moving across the deep to find the hidden place , to wash at its blindness , to melt its mindless shore , to cast it finally adrift , no steadfast island after all , upon the voyaging sea . " Are you asleep ? " " Not asleep . " " Content ? " " Ai Linda ! Linda in the dark without seeing you , Linda . " " I 'm glad . " He lifted his head and rested his chin on the heel of his hand , looking down , trying to see her in the darkness . Then he turned , sliding his arm under her neck so that her head rested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up into the black ocean . " Just so you do n't think I 'm as bad as I was Sunday . " " Luis . Why do you keep talking about Sunday ? I do n't want to remember that man and the bull . " " I meant about me Sunday . Dedicating the bull . I was ashamed . I still am . I was afraid to call you after that . Then the funeral and a lot of things . I had to be there . I had to help carry the coffin . And the mob . It was terrible , the whole business . The part you saw probably finishedyou with the bulls . I thought it finished you with me too . It was all bad . " " Why are we talking about it ? But why do you do it , Luis ? How can you go on doing that ? The scars  --  I 'm glad I ca n't see ! Why do you do it ? " " It 's what I do . You know that . Luis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linda . You saw only the bad . There is something to it , something great sometimesp138about it . I wish you could see it then . I would like to show you when it 's good . I mean sincerely in my heart some afternoons there is something . I have n't felt it for a long time ; I do n't know why . I try , and I wish I could . But I did n't show you  --  " " Luisito . You show me  --  " " Hola ! I 'm the one that gets shown . " There was a flexible line of warm softness along all his side , all of it , from his shoulder to the very end of his toe . " Is your arm getting pins and needles ? " " My arm is happy . Linda . Will you go to a plaza again , so I can show you ? . . . In the plaza ! Devil ! " " It 's important , is n't it , Luis ? " " It 's what I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my next one here is three weeks from Sunday , on the eighteenth . We 'll have a real one , God granting . One for Linda . And look , we 'll celebrate , if it 's good . Christmas week . What do you say ? Maybe go somewhere . " " We 'll see . Tell me what you do till then . Torero . " " Day after tomorrow to Guadalajara . " " How do you go , Luis ? The train ? " " Often in my car , but this time the train . Raul wants a car this week end and I told him to take mine . He 's going on some kind of party . Big lawyer business . " " Will the corrida in Guadalajara be prominent ? " " It 's a kind of a competition , with a fellow named Carlos Rojo . I do n't like him and he do n't like me . The public makes us rivals . We fight on the same cartel a lot because we contrast . I do n't work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinning . It 's a competition . It will be fairly prominent . " " And then ? " " And then not so prominent . On December Fourth a queer one . One I do n't want except for my kid brother Pepe . We go to the great metropolis of Cuenca . Just Pepe and me on a four-bull card . Raul signed for it day before yesterday . It was funny . You know how small bullrings are . I said I would n't show in Cuenca unless Pepe fought with me and unless we had real bulls to fight . I did n't think it would happen . But I thought if it did happen I would make Pepe a chance to advance his campaign as matador by fighting serious bulls . " " God ! Are n't they all serious ? " " The brave bulls with the breed in them are serious . Without them , the whole thing 's a pity . You got to have them or there 's no chance for the thing I was telling you about , what I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I got surprised about Cuenca . I did n't expect the man to get the bulls , but he fooled me . So Pepe and I are going . It 's something for the kid . " He moved in the darkness so a whole new set of fine places twined and found the lovely long line of smooth warm closeness . " Tell me more . About bulls , Senor Bello ! " " Talk , talk , talk . " " More yet . " " So then  --  oh , well . About Cuenca ? All right . What a subject ! Yesterday a friend of mine from Spain showed up at the house in San Angel . A torero without contracts.  | Shall we say it , maybe not very good in the plazas , but a good boy . From Seville . I got well from a goring  --  this one , right here  --  at his mother 's house in the barrio of San Bernardo . She took me like my own mother when I got out of hospital . She made paella I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the way she made it ! The boy 's name is Paco . Paco Saya . I 'm taking him to Cuenca with the Bello cuadrillas . He 's going as the sobresaliente , the substitute like they always have when there are only two matadors on the card . I ca n't get him anything else now , but he 's a good boy and at least he can swing his cape on a few quites with us and get his name on a Mexicancartel . So the queer corrida has got a Spaniard for a substitute matador because of some paella in Seville . Is that enough about Cuenca ? Is that enough talk , talk , talk , Linda Castillo de Calderon ? " It was . " Luis . Darling . I wish it would stay like this . " " It 's staying . " " If everything would stay away like this ! All gone away . Keep everything away , Luis . " " Linda , do n't cry ! " " I 'm not . Nothing really stays away , does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lights and there everything is . All over again . " " There are some good parts . " He kissed her and brushed her cheek with his hand , feeling her tears . " What 's the matter , kid ? There are some good parts . " They lit cigarettes . In the flare of the match she smiled at him . Propped on the pillows with an ash tray betweenp141them , they each held little round points of fire that glowed orange in the dark . " Nobody knows how it comes out , kid . Nobody can tell till they get there . But Linda . You 'll be all right . Believe me . You 're someone . I know that . " He could see her dimly in the glow when she drew on the cigarette . " Linda , you think the bulls are bad but I thank them very much . Without the bulls it never  --  you know I was kind of scared of you at first , kid . " " I 'm still scared of you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luis ! But tell me . How long do you go on with those bulls ? That business Sunday . Really ! Do n't you plan to retire ? Why do n't you ? " " Not yet Linda . Raul and I have been talking it over . We 're making a program . We figure two more seasons . That ought to fix it . I want a ranch . All toreros want a ranch sometime and I guess I 'm no different . They say the money you make belongs to the bulls . It 's the bulls ' money . They give it to you and they can take it away , anytime . It do n't actually belong to you until you retire . That 's why I spent so much , before the bulls could take it back . I know that . It 's not yours until you can walk away telling the bulls good-by forever . Then if you got anything , it 's yours . Manolete had forty million pesetas of the bulls ' money and they took it back before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something about the bulls . And the crowd . And feeling what you can do , and the big afternoon . Most bullfighters do n't know nothing else . Rememberthe little worm ? I told you about him . "  | " I remember him . He 's terrible . I do n't see how you can do it . " " I do n't either . I 'm going to quit someday , Linda . Still  --  " " Still you are proud , Luis Bello . They say pride is a sin and I suppose that it is . But oh , Luis , I wish I could be proud like you ! I 'm not proud of anything for so long , long . I was taught to be proud of myself . I remember my grandfather 's house where I lived in Toluca . " " It was n't anything like my uncle 's in Guerreras . " " Do n't be like that , Luis . It makes you very proud . And foolish . Not all the difficulties in the world are yours ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all have . But no difficultieswith Linda . None . I 'm sorry . Let me put the ash tray on the table . There . Now is n't it better ? " " I 'd do so many things differently if I could go back , Luis . " " You ca n't , and besides , you do n't have to . You 'll find out because you 're wonderful . Tell me about when you were a little girl , in Toluca . " " The most fun was the family picnics in the summertime up to the lake of the Nevada de Toluca . We 'd stay overnight . The servants would pitch tents and make barbecues , and the musicians would play at night around big fires . We 'd have games , all the cousins . Once we had fireworks . We could look down , down into the whole valley in the morning and point out Cruces , my grandfather 's hacienda in the tiny trees and the whole city of Toluca not big enough to be a toy . I had a chestnut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flowers . At night we could reach up and touch all the stars from the beautiful highp143Nevada . The musicians would still be playing when we children were put to bed in the tents , and we could hear the grown men singing by the fires , and laughing . My grandfather had a wonderful laugh , Luis . He laughed most on the picnics with all the family around . You know what he used to do when he was very old ? He sat under the galleryin front of his house in town on Sunday mornings , in a chair , holding his walking stick , and he would give the boys who came by a silver toston and a whack with his stick and say to us in the family , They may be mine ! How do I know ? ' " " I wish I had seen you when you were a little girl  --  ah Linda ! The other day , the day it rained so hard , I had me some hot chili because I was thinking about things . About being a kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbing in the bell tower and getting the squabs and the pigeon eggs and stealing the bell ropes from the priest . In Guerreras my uncle took care of horses for the Pedrazos and I was a helper . The thing I liked was in the early morning when the sun was just coming up and we rode the race horses to the edge of town . There was a five hundred vara track out there . I got to exercise the horses on the track with the soft dirt and I remember how it used to be , flat against the bareback , holding to the mane , running so the wind made my eyes water , going fast , fast , whistling , leaving dust in the shadows . That 's the fastest I ever went in my life . Coming back through town , the sun would be on the streets warm and you could smell the cook smoke from the houses . The kids would look up at me on a horse blanket and run along beside the horses and I felt big enough to run my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember anything in the Revolution , Luis ? " " Sure I can remember . When they burned the big house at the Aguabendita . I can remember when my father came back . He was a soldier with Villa . " " They killed my father . I never saw him . He never saw me . My mother used to tell about the Revolution . She carried me on a refugee train . I 'm glad I ca n't remember anything about it . " " I think we remember plenty , Lindita . Lindissima . Rememberthe good things . I can remember everything , exactly , about you . " " Luis ! Ai Luis  --  Bello ! "  | THE BELLO CUADRILLA was not a team , when it drove back to the hotel from the bullring in Guadalajara . It had fallen apart into single morbid pieces . " Tacho , " Luis Bello said , " find out if the train is late enough so we can catch the damn thing to leave this frilling place tonight . The sooner we get out of here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late , and they made it , hurrying . Surrounded by his cheerless cuadrilla and by the bags of gear and tinsel belonging to their trade , Luis Bello sat silent in the hard yellow light of the chair car . The miserable night passed slowly until the conductor led Luis to a vacated upper berth in the Pullman car where the matador managed to sleep , restless , aching in his bones , with his leg bruised and hurting , for a couple of hours before dawn . Luis Bello was worried about himself . Genuinely , deeply worried . The bulls had been good , and so had Carlos Rojo . Even El Panadero , the low man on the cartel , was all right . But Luis Bello was not . The Swordsman of Guerreras was less than " regular "  --  as the kinder critics might say  --  all afternoon . He kept away from the horns and killed his bulls with caution , finally , using only half the sword blade , and at the end depending upon the services of the puntillero'sdagger . A terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt fear . He despised a torero who felt fear , and he felt it . Every torero was worried just before a corrida , naturally , and sometimes afraid in the ring ; but a good one surmounted his dread with his will . He smothered the fear inside himself so it did n't show . Luis Bello was afraid he had shown his fear , and he despised himself , helplessand angry . He had never been afraid like that , feeling the fear eat at him like a tumor , squeezing his heart pale . But now he had . Two ears for Carlos Rojo , a circuit of the ring with applause for El Panadero . Nothing for Luis Bello . Exceptp147the discovery that he was afraid . Afraid of the horns . Afraid of what horns do . He cursed the moment of silence at the beginning of it , with the big silly sign UN MOMENTO DE SILENCIO and everybodystanding voiceless and still in the Guadalajara ring , with their hats off . The moment of silence to the memory of Juan Salazar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring in the Republic , the first corrida after a fatal goring . It upset the tempo and the pace of a corrida from the very start . The moment of silence in memory of Luis Bello . Sainted Christ of the Health ! When the train finally came into the station at the Capital , Luis Bello was so worried with himself , so genuinely worried and irritated and lacking sleep , that he thought nothing strange at seeing Pepe and Jank Delgado standing waiting for him . He gave his brother the abrazo and shook hands with Delgado , not accounting for Pepe 's white lips or the Jank 's constraint . In his preoccupation with himself he interpreted their manners as solemn sympathy for the failure that had grown inside himself on the way home from Guadalajara . Pepe hurried him through the station , motioning to Tacho , while Delgado helped quickly with the bags . " Let 's get to San Angel , " Pepe said . " Come on , Tacho ! Goyo , you boys take another cab to your houses . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Luis , Pepe made a furtive grimace to the cuadrilla . There was anguishin it , and they saw it . The Bellos , with Tacho and the Jank , got in a cab . The ride to San Angel seemed endless to Pepe Bello . Luis was so deep in his moodiness he was only graduallyp148aware of his brother 's unnaturalness , of Delgado 's silence , of Tacho 's puzzled , silent concentration on the younger Bello 's obvious strain . " What 's the matter with you ? " Tacho finally asked aloud . " Nothing , " Pepe said , shooting a look at the swordhandler . Luis caught it . " What 's eating you , Pepe ? " " N-nothing . " " Christ 's sake ! " the older Bello said , scowling . " Like somebody rammed a sausage down your throat . The corridawas n't that bad yesterday ! But I got enough worries , Jesus and Mary . And Joseph ! " They got the bags out and were paying the fare when the watchman opened the gate , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he carried the pigskin travelingcase initialed LB , and the swords . The cook Pornposawas red-eyed at the door of the house . " A hell of a home-coming after a fine corrida . Beautiful all over ! What in the Name of God , Pepe ? " " I wanted to get you home , Luis ! I just wanted to get you home ! " He motioned everyone else out of the room . " Huh ? " " Luis . " The tears Pepe Bello had been holding back , holding back tight , finally glassed his eyes and rolled out , two big round drops , down his brown cheeks . " I got to tell you something . It 's Raul . Raul got killed . " Luis Bello stood perfectly still . He did not move , with his hands down at his sides . He stood still as a stone . " Raul ? "  | " He got killed . In the car . Coming down from Cuernavaca . On the mountain . Last night . " " Raul ? " Luis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pepe ! How do you know that ? " His fists clenched , still at his sides . " Everything . The police chief on the phone . Then everybody . It 's in the paper this morning , and I was afraid , afraid you 'd see it ! Before I could tell you , before I could get you home ! " Luis Bello sat down in a chair . He sat very straight . " Raul . My right arm . " He felt his right arm . " My right arm gone . " It maimed his mind and his mind backed away from it , numb . It would have to come back . But not now , not now ! " Huh . " He looked at Pepe . " In the car ? Wrecked my car ? " " It 's junk . Nothing . Forty meters off the road . " " Huh . " The clock on the mantel ticked in the silence . " Raul and the car . " The clock ticked on . " Anybody elsein the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . " " How many ? " " Just one , one besides Raul . " " Who ? What was his name ? " " It was a girl . 0 Jesus Christ , Luis my brother  --  and I got to tell you ! The girl was Linda de Calderon . " Luis stood up . " With Raul ? Killed with Raul ? " Pepe put his hand on his brother 's shoulder . Slowly Luis pushed him aside , with his eyes coming wide open ;  |p150Luis  looking up seeing himself standing there clear and plain in the parlor mirror . His hand found the back of the straight chair . He took hold of the smooth round wood slowly , firmly . Then sent it hurtling . It smashed the mirror , shattering pieces into the air . The crash brought Tacho and Jank Delgado running through the door . Luis stopped them , wordless , motionless , looking at them as if he held a sword in his hand . He looked past them then , trembling ; he spoke very calmly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Get out , please . Go away . Get out . GET OUT ! And close the doors . " He stood at the window alone , with the clock ticking . His mind approached it , then backed away . The sweat came cold on his forehead . Slowly , slowly then , Luis Bello walked up to the horns , unarmed . He walked up to them numb , and let them come , let them touch and slide sick into him , and twist him , and when they got there inside of him , he cried . One of the horns was Raul dead and one of the horns was Linda dead and there was still another horn and that was Raul and Linda together alive . That was a horn too many for anything real , 0 God . It was a horn he had never seen and how it cut and tore ! One horn at a time , 0 Father Jesus , one horn is all I can bear . Old Raul my right arm . Raul that took care of everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept it all going in the green times and the ripe ones . Old Raul , my sword arm , and I lost him . And Linda . The flower and cream not like it sounds but truly , and it 's gone . Gone . Linda that had troubles , I neverp151knew what . I 'll never know now at all . Nor help . Linda that was beautiful , by God , with the real casta in her who pardoned a torero . Linda and Raul . Did you really do it ? To me ? I wo n't ever know . Maybe you did n't . I hope I never find out . But I 'll think , 0 God , I 'll think . Raul doing it to me . Maybe he did n't , going in the car . Taking my blue car and making everything a pile of junk . I was always going to be the one , the pile of junk they worried about . I was going to be the one that got it all the time , the dead one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the silence with the horns in him . He heard the phone ringing in the hall , and the footsteps going and the voices around him in his house , the strands and colors he had woven in wrappings around the central strange shape the days beat out upon their anvil forming him , the wrappings that padded Luis Bello and hid him from himself . Now these integuments of vanityand ornament , of necessity , of service , of faith and affection , were torn away suddenly : he had smashed the mirror that showed him the shape of himself without them . Nothing is yours until you walk away telling the horns good-by forever , Luis Bello . But you got nothing worth carrying away then , have you ? Are you afraid ? What is it you fear , Luis ? Is it the horn that rips so fast , and turns you twisting dizzy in the air , and comes out red and sticky ? Is that it ? Is it the smell of ether when things go gray in the infirmary ? Or is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fever at night ? What is it now , looking at yourself , Luis ? What else did you see in the mirror ? There 's something that has n't happened yet , Luis Bello ,  | and horns or no horns it finds you . It found the old uncle the week before last , and last week it found Juan Salazar . This week it came to Raul and Linda . Now it 's headed for you . You 'll get it . And this week you 'll have to go again to the hushed place and look down into the box . Not one box but two , O God . With the smell of the wax and the sickly flowers in the candlelight you 'll hear it again , the Mass with the voices on the rim , the terrible high mysterious rim that crumbles away forever from the sun and the color and the crowd and falls away , into dust , into  --  Luis Bello could name it . He knew what it was , and he looked at it there in himself , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was something finished about it , and because he was alive , he turned away from it . He turned away from it the only way he knew how . Standing by the broken mirror he blew his nose and put on his sunglasses , and he walked out . " I 'm going , " he said to Pepe . The whole cuadrilla was standing there . " Where ? " said Pepe . " How ? " " I 'm leaving for a while . I 'm making a circuit . " " I 'll go with you , " his brother said . " Nobody 's going with me . Understand ? You understand that ? You leave me alone . " " Luis , for God , take it easy ! " He walked out the front door bareheaded , across the garden , unlatched the gate and went through , pulling it closed after him . Pepe and all the cuadrillas watched him go. " 0 Christ of the Pains ! " said Tacho . " The first nightp153Luis went for that honey-headed whore I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I saw it arming . Oh , I saw the great foul frilling father and senor of all filth arriving . Look at it ! I 'm going after Luis ! " " Wait a minute ! " Pepe said . " You want to get him real crazy ? Raul used to handle him , but we got to do it now . And do it right . We got to let him go wherever he thinks he 's going . But maybe we can tail him till he cools off . And bring him back . " " I know him . He ai n't going to cool , " Tacho moaned . " I seen the bull 's ear twitch , and John of the Palms , boy , the horns are here . They 're on top of us now ! " Goyo Salinas said . He spit . " Goyo , you and the boys handle things at the house , " Pepe said . He started down the lane with Tacho , and the Jank . Luis saw them when he turned around to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , devoted . It made him angry . He stopped and made the sign he made in the plazas , motioning his peons to get away , get behind the barrera . Then he walked on , faster . They saw him step into a taxi by the convent square , and they were too far away , too far . " Why the hell did n't we get in Goyo 's car ? Why did n't we ? " " He 'll be all right , " said Jank Delgado . " He 'll take care of himself . " They watched the taxi drive away , down the slope from San Angel . " Get off the boulevard , " Luis ordered the driver . " This is worth your while . "  | The cabman hoped it was ; he knew who sat behind the sunglasses on the back seat of his cab , all right . Toreros were characters . This one did n't want any talk today . The cabman drove . Leave it , thought Luis Bello . Get out of this week . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see it . I ca n't look at it . I ca n't see them , and smell the flowers and hear the Mass and go to the graves . Leave it . Leave it . Leave everything . Leave the bulls , everything about the bulls , the people , the places that know bulls . Know Raul , know me  --  know Linda . Leave it . The cabman drove a long time . Luis sat alone with himself . Leaving , leaving all of it . Then he wished he had a cigar to leave with . He did n't have one . Not even a match . He did n't have a drink either . And he did n't have a place to go , leaving everything . They even wrecked my car . I ca n't go no place . I got no place , except with the bulls . Because I never made another kind of a place and I never thought about it before . The damned bulls and I 'm through with them . I 'm through with anybody that knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where 's that around here , where they wo n't find me ? Never find me . Where I can get a cigar and have a drink away from the bulls . " Driver . You know the Tenocotle ? That little three-sided dump of a plaza , Tenocotle ? You know it ? Well , take me there . " He paid , and let the taxi go away , around the corner out of sight , before he moved from the curb . Then he crossed the street and hurried a block and knocked at a door painted green.  |p155He  stood there waiting a long time for an answer . When it came , the door opened only an inch or two . He had to lift his sunglasses and show his face before they let him in and he was angry , with his red eyes . " Senor Bello ! Truly it is ! Don Luis of the bulls ! And so long since we 've seen you , since we had the honor . 0 mother mine ! And at such an hour ? Monday morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mamacita . This is important , " Luis Bello said . His voice grated . " No Senor Don Luis of anything . Understand ? None of your damned dash and scratch . Understand ? I came here . That 's all . It 's a place . " He pulled his wallet from his hip pocket and handed it to the old lady . " Here  --  you keep this for me . Take what you need to pay for what I want . I 'll tell you what that is , when I want it , and to hell with your beauties ! Understand ? I want to sit under the grape arbor in the back . See ? I want to sit at a table with some cigars and a drink . I want you to keep bringing me cigars and tequila until I quit asking for them , or until I ask for something else . I want to sit . See ? Quiet . Frilling goddamned quiet , you old hag . Get it ? " I 'm proud , eh , Linda ?  |p156CALLERS  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone rang . There were questions Luis could answer , situations Luis could resolve , and Luis was gone . Tacho had no luck all day , trying to trace the taxi Luis had taken.  |p157Pe|pe  went searching in Goyo 's car . He went to the morgue , to the undertakers ' , asking if Luis had been there . He called at Raul 's mother 's . After inquiry , with embarrassment and hesitation , he even took flowers and presented himself to Linda 's relatives , looking hopefully for Luis and not finding him . Back to San Angel , frustrated , Pepe answered the telephonewhile Jank Delgado handled the callers . Impresarios , managers , agents , bull breeders , parasites , worried about agreements and contracts with Raul Fuentes , called anxiouslyto express sympathy  --  and to inquire about the new Bello management . There was no new Bello management . There was no Luis Bello . His men did not want to say Luis Bello had walked out . It sounded queer ; they had a story they told instead . Luis was emotional over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was not seeing anyone . Not even dear friends . Repeated over and over , the story was a strain . And the reporters did not believe it . When evening came the cuadrilla became a search party making the rounds of the cafes and bars where the bull crowd collected . They asked for Luis at the desk in the Ritz , the Reforma , the Regis , and went down the line , while those in the house at San Angel waited and wrangled . " What would you do , " asked the Jank , " if the Bomba Atomica went off in your face ? What would I do ? Get drunk . Pig-dirty pulque drunk . If we could find the right saloon we could find Luis  --  " " Fix yourself ! " Pepe was angry . " You ai n't Luis . Luis is responsible . He complies . Like he complies in the ring till the mules take the last bull out . "  | " Yeee , he complied all right . With himself . He blew a big fuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tacho said . " And I hate the policia but we got to call the cops to find him . " " The only thing the cops will do is give it to the newspapers , " said the Jank . " Luis 'll be back . He 'll come back when he 's ready . " " And when 's that ? " Pepe asked bitterly . " Raul 's funeral tomorrow afternoon . The corrida at Cuenca Sunday  --  Jesus Christ ! " At a quarter to ten that night Don Felix Aldemas Leon , his round face very sober , walked into Luis Bello 's parlor . " Pepe . Where 's Luis ? " There was authority in his voice and in his question . It was too heavy for Pepe . " Don Felix , we do n't know . " " I thought it was queer . Nobody seeing him all day . Where did he go ? " " We do n't know . He just walked out of the house after I told him this morning . After he got home from Guadal-ajara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . Has he been to the woman 's ? Do you know ? " " No , I went there myself . " " You 've looked everywhere for him all the places he goes ? " " The cuadrilla 's out yet . We been looking and worryingall day . " " Then he 's out on the town . Drunk . I know these bullfighters . Have you asked the police to help ? " " No sir . " " That must be done , done properly . Where 's the phone ? "  |p159Pe|pe  , Tacho , and the Jank stood looking at each other like children . At the telephone in the hall , Don Felix called the Chief of Police . " Scour the dives , Jefe , " they heard him say . " You know these artists . " " Now , " said Don Felix , returning from the hall . " They ought to have him by morning . His face is as well known as the Bronze Horse on the Reforma . " Pepe , I came out here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luis is an artist  --  one of the great artists of our country  --  and artists have temperaments . They also have curious attitudes about the money they make and throw away . " I came out here to speak to Luis . Until I can speak to him I will mention a few words to you . I was a friend of Raul Fuentes , and a friend of Raul 's father . God have them both now in His glory . As lawyer for Raul 's family it is my duty to attend Raul 's tangled affairs after the tragedy of last night . His financial affairs are greatly involved with your brother Luis . " As you know , I have been a friend and admirer of Luis Bello for years . I feel deeply the aficion for the bulls . I intend to see your brother 's affairs properly straightened out , along with Raul 's , though God alone knows the difficultiesof justice . " I wish to say this . And impress it upon Luis , and upon you too , at the beginning of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you make in the plazas at the risk of your lives . Unless Luis changes , he will end with nothing . Like Salazar , like a hundred more anyone can name . It is time Luis changed . And this sad day is a good daypI60 to determine that change . I have only affection for the memory of Raul Fuentes , and understanding for irresponsibilitiesand ill judgments of young men with hot blood . But I do not wish to see your brother make any more mistakes . " I offer Luis my services now in handling the increment of the remainder of his career , and guarding it for his benefit , for his family , for his old age  --  if God grants him old age . He must do it . And you must do it too , young man . " In my position at this sad time , and in future if you so desire , I can manage the Bello money affairs . I can not of course manage the Bello affairs in the plazas and box offices and journals , up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for some manager within the professional atmosphereof the bulls . But ! I see my duty . I intend to speak to Luis Bello clearly . " Now . I will see him when they find him . I hope he is in shape to pay his respects to the remains of his friend Fuentes tomorrow . You tell Luis I am acting on the presumptionthat he will fulfill all contracts and agreements just as his now deceased manager arranged them . And that I will help him in any way . " Don Felix put on his gray fedora hat and his topcoat . " I hope Luis is all right , Pepe . It has been a blow . A hard blow . With the woman and all that , too . Good night . " " Yai ! " said the Jank when Don Felix had gone . " He wears the whiskers . That 's what this encierro of artists needs around here . A man wearing the whiskers ! " " He wears them , " Tacho said . " He calls the cops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere . Nobody 's seen him  --  "  | " Get some rest , Goyo . Tell all the boys to get some rest . We done what we could . We even called the cops . " " The cops ? You hit bone there , kid . That 's bad . " " Come on out in the morning , Goyo . " Pepe and Tacho were up with the first light , drinking coffee in the kitchen . " He must have left town , " Tacho said . " I thought about it all night . You know , he blew once before . In Lima , when he got word his wife was dead . Just blew . Missed a corrida when he needed corridas . Showed up looking like a picador'snag with the saddle gone . Ten years ago . It 's where he got the medal of Santa Barbara , now I remember . Mother mine ! No torero ever wore Santa Barbara in the ring , that I ever heard . She 's for storms and earthquakes . " His wife was named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why he wears it . " " I know that . But she is the saint of storms . Not so bad for a torero . Eh ? Storms and earthquakes . Christ , but Luis has been bad since you saw him in Guerreras ! I never seen him afraid before . I never seen him so bad . Now this thing . Washing him up ! " Tacho knocked on wood , shaking his head . " Listen , Tacho . He 'll be all right . He 's got to be all right . Next Sunday . It 's my chance . Las Astas bulls at Cuenca . Luis has got to be all right . So we can go . " " He ai n't getting in any ring to kill himself if I can help it . Not in his shape ! " " He 'll be all right by Sunday . " " We do n't even know where in the name of the dirty milk he is ! No telling what 's happened to him  --  " There were tears in Tacho 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked out of the kitchen angry . A police inspector arrived to ask questions . He stayed almost an hour . The cuadrillas came , dressed in their dark suits , for a funeral . Paco Saya , the torero from Seville , showed up in a beret , and a scarf knotted around his neck . The crowd grew . Two more policemen came . The phone rang . The crowd was glum , sitting around smoking Luis Bello 's cigars . They talked about him . About Raul , about the blonde . Carai ! Too many funerals lately . The blonde was really Luis 's babe , all right . Eehoh , and Raul Fuentes with her ! What a pity . No wonder Luis jumped the barrera ! " Tacho , " said Jank Delgado , when he got the swordhandleralone in the hall , " you and I ought to think about money . The bull is loose in the plaza now , and we got to think of it . I 'm not putting a long nose on my face ; I just want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , Pomposa ought to feed this mob before we go to the funeral , or afterwards , and there ought to be drinks . " " She will . There will be . " " You handle the funds for the house ? Have you got some ? " " None of your frilling business , Delgado . I 'm a swordhandler . I pay the cuadrillas . I handle the money on trips , I make reservations , I send telegrams , I work like a dirty dog . I pay the expenses here at the house from money Luis gives me . But I do n't keep no account book if that 's what you 're swinging a rag at . I 'm honest , see ? " " Do n't get so tender . I do n't mean anything about whatp163you do with the peluco . That 's your business . I mean do you have enough now ? Until Luis shows up ? " " I got some . I also got the check from the Empresa de Toros in Guadalajara , for that corrida . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luis trusts me , if nobody else do n't ! I deal with real stuff . Not garbage . " " For Christ 's sake . Ram it . I was just going to tell you I had a little in my pocket if we got stuck  --  " The Jank had fully two pesos in that pocket . " You 're not a bad kid , " Tacho said . " Some of these bull followers  --  " " Bulls ai n't the only thing I 've followed , twin . Ram it . " The phone rang again and Pepe came into the hall where they stood . He picked up the receiver . " Who speaks ? " asked a female voice on the wire . " Pepe Bello speaking . " " Is this Luis Bello 's house ? " " Yes . Who is this ? " " You Luis Bello 's brother ? " " What do you want ? I 'm his brother . " " Listen , Bello boy . Come and get him ! " " Huh ? ' What 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , sonny boy . " " Where ? " Pepe Bello yelled into the phone . " Where is he ? " " You come and get him . " " Where , goddammit ? " " Tenocotle . Tenocotle 6 and be quiet about it . No policia ! You hear that ? " " You just hold him . Hold him . I 'm coming from San Angel ! "  | He slammed down the phone and turned to Tacho and the Jank . " Get Goyo and let 's go ! " Goyo 's car worked hard , going fast , going toward town . The four of them sat in it , trying to help it go faster , sitting on the edge of the seats , not going fast enough . " Tenocotle , Tenocotle , where 's that ? I never heard of it , " Pepe said . " I know where it is all right , " Goyo said . " I was n't born in this town for nothing . No wonder we could n't find him . Tenocotle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jank reminded them . " He just went off for vacations . Remember what he said , I 'm making a circuit ' ? Remember ? " " He 's making a circuit , que tio ! A fluffing house at a time like now ! I thought of saloons , " Goyo said , " but I never thought of the feathers ! No wonder we did n't find him . Que tio padrote ! That Luis ! Last night fluffing the feathers . Ole ! " " The mama says he was wrecking the place , " Pepe grinned . " Oh , he 's a peril when he 's drunk , " Tacho said . " I know him . " " We know him , " said Goyo . " Que tio ! " The green door opened immediately . All four of them went in . " Well ! " Pepe recognized the voice on the phone . It came from between all the lipstick , on the old lady . Three of her girls in very short dresses were standing in the patio with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's the matter with him , anyway ? He used to be a nice man . "  | " Where is he ? " " He 's in a room . " The girls rolled their eyes at the gentleman callers . The old lady unlocked a door and they all walked into a dim place lighted only by the light from the opened door . Luis had been sick . He was lying across a broken bed with his head down . His shirt was torn . They could see the immense scar in his left armpit . There was a long red scratch across his cheek and his knuckles were bloody . A leg of the bed was broken and so were a chair and a crockery washbowl and a pitcher smashed on the bare floor in a corner . The room was a dirty wreck and so was Luis Bello . They knelt down and felt him and listened to him breathe . Pepe wiped his brother 's mouth and chin with a handkerchief . Luis Bello groaned. " 0 Sacred Name , " Tacho said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What happened ? " " What happened ? 0 what happened ! " the old lady said . " Thank God there was n't a sword in the house last night . He thought we were bulls . " " How long was he here ? Did he drink much ? " " Did he drink much ! Pig ! He came about noon yesterday . There was something wrong . " She pointed to her right temple and rolled her watery eyes . " Crazy . He just sat . And drank . Too quiet . Until last night . Ai ! He made me lock the door to the street ! We had to turn a quantity of respectables away unhappy from our door . This torero here said the plaza was closed , the encierro was his . Then he said he wanted a band of music and all services of plaza ,  | complete . He tied ribbons on the girls for divisas and he used my good shawl for a cape . 0 the scandal ! Everybody'sgot a cold this morning . Listen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He got rough when he began calling for a horse and a pie ! Never again ! Crazy , that 's what he is . I had to hit him over the head . " They found the knot on his skull . Goyo could hardly lift for laughing . " 0 Luis ! Que tio ! Que tio mio ! " They pulled on his pants and coat . " Did he pay ? " Pepe asked . They carried him across the patio . " He paid all right , " said the mama . " I 'll say he paid . " She pulled the wallet from her bosom and . handed it to Pepe . " Here . I kept the money . The damages are terrible . I run a nice place here , boys . Come back sometime . But by the sacred name of the little virgin of dew , you better not come like bullfighters ! " The green door went shut and they loaded Luis into the back seat of the car . He was violently sick on the Insurgentes . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hoping no one would recognize them . When they put him back on the seat , Luis opened his eyes . " Huhh , " he said . " I 'm sick . 0 I 'm sick . " " Fine , Luis , fine , " Tacho said , holding him up . " We 're going home . " His matador did not respond . " Eleven-thirty , " Tacho said , seeing the clock on a barbecuedrive-in . " We 'll get him a bath and soak him good while Pomposa is making him menudo . A bath and some good strong tripe gruel , that 's what he needs . " " We 'll get the barber to the house too , " Pepe said , pl67 " right away . Luis needs him , and he needs the back of his neck rubbed with that hot stuff , like a barber can do it . That will fix him . " " My friends , " said the Jank , " what Luis needs is the doctor with the penicillin . The wonders of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " 0 the bulls he worked last night ! " Goyo said . " They got the splintered horns ! What you call that stuff , Jank , pencillin ? " The crowd at the house in San Angel all watched Luis being carried upstairs . Everybody followed , jamming into his room . " Plastered , " Goyo said , explaining . " Just plastered . " " Poor Luis , " they said . All emotionated . " " He 'll be all right , " Tacho said , " if you will get the hell out of here and let us fix him up . How about the menudo , the barber  --  and that doctor , Jank ? I 'll draw the bath . " How you feel , Luis , big goat with the whiskers , how you feel ? " Two hours later he could hardly feel at all , except feel sick and feel shame . In a silk dressing robe he sat up in a chair , trying to eat menudo , after the bath . The doctor had been there ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent . Long distance from Guerreras was calling Luis Bello . " I 'll take it , " Pepe said . He went downstairs to the phone in the hall . It was Carmela Bello asking for Luis . " You ca n't speak to him , " Pepe said . " Have n't you heard ? We got tragedy . "  | " Tragedy ? Help us God , what is it ? " " Raul Fuentes has been killed . " " Oh . But you and Luis ? " " Luis is emotionated . I 'm fair , but very busy . " " Thanks to God you are safe . I called because we have trouble in Guerreras . " " What now ? " " Alfredo 's in jail . We ca n't make his bail . " " Good , " Pepe said . " You sound like Luis ! Do n't you make me mad ! The disgrace  --  " " What 's he in for ? " " Bad checks . In Monterrey . " " We got enough worries , Carmela . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak to Luis ! This instant ! " " You ai n't speaking to any Luis . " " Oh Pepe ! " He could hear her crying . " Pepe . Aguilar has cut off our credit at the store . You remember the bill ? The forty-seven hundred pesos Luis got so mad about ? It has n't been paid . Aguilar wo n't charge any more . What will we do ? " " Name of God , we got enough to worry about without a grocery bill ! Why do n't you get somebody in that house to go to work and earn some groceries ? Huh ? " " Beast ! I 'm telling you , little man ! I 've had enough ! I 'm going into a convent ! There ! " She slammed the receiverin Pepe 's ear . " The happy day ! The good life ! " Pepe said , going upstairs . He spit on the floor . " I 'd like to get plastered too . " Luis was drooping in his chair , holding his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carmela . The usual . The difficulties in Guerreras . Alfredo'sin jail . The grocery bill not paid . Carmela taking the veil  --  so she says . " Luis Bello did not answer . " Luis , " Pepe said , after a long silence . " In about an hour there 's the funeral . Will you go with us ? You know  --  " " The hell with it . " " I know how you feel but  --  " " Which one , Pepe ? " It took him a moment to understand . " Oh ! Raul 's  --  it 's Raul 's . " " The other ? " " That was this morning . It 's over . Yesterday I took flowersand went there . For you . Would you go with me now , Mano ? The public expects  --  " " The hell with it . I ca n't . " The Jank came into the room . " The frilling phone again downstairs . It 's long distance from Cuenca now . Wants to speak to Luis Bello . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And listen , Jose Antonio Bello , you go tell Cuenca to take those bulls and ram them , " Luis said . " I 'm through . The hell with the bulls . " Going out the door , with his face turned from Luis , Pepe winked solemnly at the Jank . Eladio Gomez was on the wire . " Bueno ? Luis ? " " No , Senor Gomez , this is Pepe . Pepe Bello . Luis ca n't come to the phone today . He sent me . " " Pepe . I feel deeply the tragedy of Fuentes . Accept mypI70 sympathies . I called about the corrida Sunday . I want to make sure of my contract  --  " The worry was in Gomez 's voice . " Naturally , Senor Gomez . Naturally , " Pepe delayed . " I will tell you . We are upset . Very bad . Luis , he  --  he 's sick . But I will tell you . I think he will be all right . I think he will be there  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cartels , the bulls . The corrida in five days only ! Jesus Christ , man ! I got to know ! " " Naturally . Naturally Senor Gomez , Don Eladio . I will tell you . I will let you know if he ca n't . Otherwise , go ahead . I think he will . I am pretty sure . " " Listen . You 're saying he might not come ! Breach of contract ! You are responsible , you are liable . Are you both coming ? " " You go ahead please , Senor Gomez . I will be there and Luis , Luis is coming too  --  " " That 's your word ! Five days only . I 'm counting on it . I want a telegram from Luis saying it . You hear ? In writing ! " Pepe was sweating all over when he came back upstairs to Luis . " Did you tell Gomez ? " Luis asked , scowling . " I told him . " Pepe sat down . The barber was rubbing Luis 's neck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask him again about things . He had to . One thing at a time . " Luis , you going to the funeral with us ? " When the barber quit rubbing , Luis looked up . Thep171color was gone from his face and his eyes were sunk in their sockets . They looked too dark and unnaturally wet . The long red scratch marked the pallor of his cheek . " I feel terrible . I 'm sick . But old Raul . Jesus and Mary , I guess I ought to . I ought to go . "  | THURSDAY MORNING Eladio Gomez was dulled with gloom when he walked into his bullring . Looking up at the forlorn empty seats of his lifeless plaza in the harsh morning light , he perfunctorily told Sanchez to hurry and get done with the red paint on the barrera . Then hep173went through the toril on his way to the shack by the corrals to find Chon Munoz . Chon was as familiar at the bullring of Cuenca as the sign over the main gate . He was an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cuadrilla of young Gaona ; those were the days of his glory and he liked to talk of them , and of his friendship with 0jitos . Living now in poverty with his big family in the shack by the plaza corrals , he still devoted himself to the golden illusion of his life , to the bulls . He took care of the bull corrals , and the bulls before they died , and the toril door during the corridas . He handled the livestock for his employer , Eladio Gomez . " You got to clean up those chiqueros soon , Chon , " Gomez told him , talking about the small , dark , manurecakedpens he had passed by , under the plaza , where each bull spent his last hours in solitude before his exit to glory through the toril door . " The Las Astas are coming today . Are the corrals and the feed ready ? What about that leakingwater trough in the big corral ? And Chon , what about horses ? What about those two nags Landeros wants to sell ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " " I think we need them , " Chon said . " Number One bulls will be a pity to our Rosinantes here . Look at the four bone-bags we got in the patio for Sunday ! They need help . " " Not if it 's expensive , " Gomez said . " You see about it . " Vicente Domingo , the pockmarked caretaker of the Cuenca plaza , met his boss at the door of the workshop under the stands on the sunny side . " I have the sign artist today , " Vicente said . " And Jacinto is finishing the banderillas. "  | " Why ca n't you learn to paint lettering yourself ? " Gomez asked . He stepped in the shop . It smelled of fish glue and black tobacco . Strung on wires above his head , scores of paperfrilledand flowered banderillas colored the gloom . The hunchback Jacinto grinned when Gomez came up to his side by the table littered with bright tissue , scissors , wire , knives , and glue pots . " These are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Eladio , " Jacinto said , pointing . " I got the barbs from the blacksmith yesterday and ground them myself . " " Be sure there are two dozen matched pairs to show to the Asesor , " Gomez told the little hunchback . He hefted one of the colored sticks . " And here are the pretty ribbons , the divisas of green and gold , " the hunchback said . The sign man was in the corner by the window , letteringthe time , the place , and LAS ASTAS , on lithographed onesheetposters of Luis Bello haughtily dressed in a shining traje . " These are the ones for downtown ? " Gomez asked . " Nine , " Vicente said . " Get them placed today . " Gomez stood watching the sign man 's hand , with the letters coming so easy out of the end of the brush . Walking alone across town to his office on Hidalgo Street , Gomez was in a bitter mood . He was like the sign artist , he thought , without any paint on the brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lacking the paint . Luis Bello was the paint . And Luis Bello , that son of a whore of a bullfighter , had not yet said he would be in Cuenca.  |p175Today  , if no word came , Gomez would have to act . He would have to scramble for a substitute for Luis Bello . And lose money . Because he mentioned the wrong name at the Plaza Club one morning . He remembered with disgusthow it all happened . He cursed the worries it had brought him . Along the street , window cards peered at him like reproaches , with that name in red at the top , Luis Bello . The office of the Empresa de Toros of Cuenca was cold on winter mornings . The yellowish light over the box office window where old Lara sat , and the light over Eladio Gomez 's desk behind the railing , spread no cheer in the dim place where the impresario of Cuenca promoted his sunlit spectacles . Before he sat down at his desk , he ripped the November sheet off the calendar on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unopened telegram Lara had put on his desk . Gomez saw it with foreboding . It was bad . He could feel its badness staring up at him from the desk . Bello wo n't come . He picked it up and tore it open and read it . LUIS AND PEPE BELLO WITH CUADRILLAS AND SOBRESALIENTESAYA ARRIVE CUENCA BY TRAIN SATURDAY FOR CORRIDA AS CONTRACTED . FELIX ALDEMAS L. " Huhh , " Gomez breathed , letting the air come out slowly . " It 's about time ! Huh . " The heaviness began to slide from his shoulders ; he felt light all of a sudden , and fine . " Take a look , Lara ! " he said . " Who is this Aldemas ? You know any manager named Aldemas ? " " Nobody . It is an unfamiliar name in the atmosphere . "  | " I wonder who is this Aldemas ; I hope this telegram is all right . I think I 'll go over to the Plaza Club . If Santana comes in , tell him now I will buy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw in the shops along Hidalgo Street were different now , with that red name at the top . Eladio Gomez had paint on his brush . Only a few early birds were at the Plaza Club bar when he walked in and ordered lime and salt with his regular tequila . It tasted fine as he stood there gazing pleasantly at the cartel on top of the stack of handbills asking for takers by his elbow on the bar . " Grand Corrida de Toros , " he read , " Festival of the Day of Santa Barbara , SensationalPresentation , LUIS BELLO - " He could taste the cartel along with the tequila . Nobody at the Plaza knew any manager named Aldemas . Never heard of him . Too bad about Raul Fuentes , was n't it ? When were the bulls coming ? Were they really Number Ones ? Salvador Cofino hurried in , and ordered a beer . He greeted Gomez in deep-voiced Castilian ; he was on his way to the ranch now , to look at some sheep for his father . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrida , of course . Luis Bello had n't looked so well in the plaza lately , had he ? In a slump , probably . He hoped that Sunday  --  " Salvador , " said Gomez , " you knew Fuentes . Bello too . I got a telegram from a new manager of the Bellos I never heard of . Aldemas . You know him ? " " Aldemas ? No torero manager I know , named Alde-mas . " " Felix Aldemas L. "  | " One moment ! " Cofino said . " That 's Aldemas Leon ! Naturally I know him . A friend of my father , a great friend of the Fuentes . One of the big lawyers of the Capital . Everybody knows fat Don Felix . Do n't tell me he is managing bullfighters ! " " He signed a telegram from the Bellos this morning . " " Oh ! Then he must be helping . In the business Raul left . He must be helping Luis , until things get straight . That must be it . " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Responsible ? My God , Gomez , Don Felix ? " " Good ! " Gomez said . " Have another beer . " Cofino laughed . " I start for the ranch , thanks . I will be in the first row Sunday ! " Eladio Gomez felt expansive with the tequila and the telegram when he got back from the Plaza Club . " Santana in yet ? " " Not yet , " Lara said . Gomez put a yellow sheet of paper in his typewriter . " I think I will write a little propaganda myself . " For Radio Diffusion on XECUTEXT : T 0 R 0 S ! ! ! Here is a marvelous , a stupendous , a truly formidable announcement to provoke tumult and rejoicing in the ranks of the passionate partisans of Our Brave Festi-val ! ! ! LUIS BELLO , The Enormous Swordsman of Guerreras , the grand master of the steel and the cloth , the emotionaldominator of bulls , the virile and valorous idol of the plazas of the New World and the Old , YES , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sun- day demonstrating his art with magnificent bulls of Las Astas , YES , LAS ASTAS bulls , bravest in the Republic ! ! ! And with Luis will be Pepe , YES , PEPE BELLO , alternatingwith his brother , unfolding his magic cape to feast the eyes of the fortunate with his gallantry and alegria ! ! ! TWO SUPERB TOREROS ! FOUR BULLS OF LAS ASTAS ! DO N'T FORGET ! SUNDAY ! PLAZA DE TOROS , CUENCA ! FOUR O'CLOCK SHARP ! ! ! " Enthusiasm , " said Gomez , pulling his work from the typewriter with appreciation . " That 's what that coyote Santana needs . Enthusiasm . " Gomez 's mind settled to details with relish , now that he might make some money , now that Luis Bello was coming . The paint flowed from the end of his brush , addingbusy little dots of color to the stage he dressed for the bulls . He wrote memos to himself about a discount on ice for the beer vendors ' buckets ; about the hundred newly coveredcushions for renting at the ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least , to hit the drum when the band played " La Macarena " ; about a new head usher  --  since the trouble with the colonel last time who took eight seats without tickets and threw the head usher in jail for protesting , Gomez had to be careful about ushers . The colonel was still mad ; it was bad to have a mad colonel around . A new head usher . " Lara , " he called , " will you get word to Prado and Olanda that I want to see them today ? We got to keep the union business straight . " Jose Prado and Gonzalo Olanda were on the cartel for Sunday , fillers for the cuadrillas.  |p179They  were local members of the Union Mexicana de Picadoresy Banderilleros , and they had to be hired to meet union regulations . " It 's a crime , " Gomez said to Lara again , " when even bull stickers and rag wavers organize . " Still feeling expansive , Gomez decided to go ahead and get the pretty blue neon light repaired over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vicente about some fresh flowers there . The paper ones were getting kind of faded . He even decided to buy the two nags from Landeros , now that Luis Bello was coming . The afternoon was wearing away , carrying with it some of Eladio Gomez 's enthusiasm , as he plotted propaganda with Santana by his desk . He was talking about a little free time on XECU , a radio interview with Luis Bello upon his arrival in Cuenca , to stir up the fans , when one of Chon Munoz 's kids came breathing hard in the office , with word from the bullring . The boy was excited . " Don Eladio ! " he said . " The bulls ! They 're here . The truck from Las Astas ! " " Ha ! " said Gomez . " You hear that , Santana ? Good , heh ? I 'm going to the ring , Lara . Take care of the office . If anyone wants to see us disembox , tell them to hurry ! " Approaching the ring with Santana , Gomez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusty truck with the brand of Tiburcio Balbuena painted on the door of the cab . He saw the four big bull boxes lashed to the truck bed ; he saw Policarpo Cana squatting in the shade by the gate talking to old Chon . Policarpo had brought the pasturesof Las Astas to town with him . He brought them with the cut of his striped charro pants , with his short jacket wrinkled with sweat and pale with dust , with his big crimped straw sombrero and red chin string  --  and most of all with his leathery face , and his eyes squinted from looking all his life into the sun . Policarpo was part of something good  --  something far from business  --  Gomez remembered that morning in the sunlight in front of the big house at Las Astas . " Policarpo ! " " Senor Gomez , at your orders ! " They shook hands smiling . " You got them here . " " Yes , senor ! All in shape , well arranged . " He reachedinto his jacket and unbuttoned a shirt pocket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salutes and respects . " " How is the dueno ? And all Las Astas ? " " Well . Thanks to God , very well . " " How was the encierro I saw loaded for El Toreo ? " " Credit to the ribbons . Three lost ears before they left the arrastre . Procuna and Canitas cut them . " " Are these going to lose some ears Sunday , eh ? " He pointed to the truck . " How not ? " Policarpo laughed . " Senor Gomez , one lacks a tail already ! Ho ! " Gomez frowned . He was sensitive about that one . " A brute . Truly a brute , " he said , opening the papers Policarpohad given him . The sheet on top gave the names and numbers of the bulls . A crowd had collected around the truck . Gomez read aloud : " Tramillero 74 , Bandolero 107 , Regalon 37 , and  --  for God , Balbuena named him wizard ! Brujo 23 ! Well , we 'll see . " Vicente the caretaker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painter with all his helpers , came out to join the crowd by the truck . " Here 's the names and numbers  --  for the toril door , " said Gomez , looking at Vicente and then the poster man . " Take care of that . " Don Alberto Iriarte , the Engineer Vilar , and a whole Packard sedan full of aficionados from the Plaza Club drew up by the patio gate smiling , and got out to watch the faena of the disemboxing . When greetings and handshakings and cigar lightings were over , Gomez looked up at the Las Astas truck , and then at Chon Munoz . " Corrals ready ? " Gomez asked . " Shall we ? " " All ready . " " Then , Policarpo , if you will drive the truck around to the chute  --  " The disemboxing was dramatic and fascinating for everyone who loved the bulls . It was better than setting off dangerous fireworks , standing close , lighting them with a short fuse . The crowd took up silent stations on the platformbuilt atop one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaza corrals . The truck drove to the mouth of the unloading chute so that the head gate of the first bull box fitted against it squarely . Chon Munoz and his helper Miguel , who wanted to be a torero , entered the corrals ; Gomez climbed with Policarpo to stand atop the bull boxes . The very wood of those boxes seemed alive , squeaking and shaking queerly with the power confined within them . Gomez could feel the impressiveness of that dark invisible power so close under him . The least movement and shiftingof his weight brought violence . Horns struck the plank- ing so hard they stung his feet through the soles of his shoes . Chon Munoz , standing at the end of the runway directly facing the mouth of the chute , signaled he was ready . " Let the amo , the master , out first ! " he shouted . Policarpo reached down and pulled up the head gate . They heard the bull grunt . They waited in silence . Then the great beast , with a snort that whistled , plunged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs as it charged snuffing down the runway , ravening to get Chon Munoz on its horns . The old banderillero calmly lured the bull past the gate into the corral , then dodged behind a burladero in the corner . It was the bobtailed bull with the whiskers ; it lunged against the burladero after Chon , its black-tipped horns thudding into the wood , tearing again and again , throwing chunks and splinters of the planking into the air . Gomez felt a moment of panic : the horns might be broken and ruined for the corrida . " Miguel ! " Gomez bawled , with the fear clutching at him . " Fool ! Get him away ! Ai ! Start him ! " Miguel ran out where the bull could see him . He ran waving his arms , shouting , " Huh huh huh ! Toro ! Huh ! " and the bull spun around and charged him , across the corral . Miguel disappeared through a narrow slot in the adobe wall . The bull skidded to a stop at the opening , hooking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empty , silent corral . Hot and furious , with its neck muscle swollen high , head up , alert for killing , the bull challenged the emptiness , the silence , ready . The challengewent unanswered in the quietness . The truck made a noise adjusting the next box to theP183mouth of the chute and the head gate screeched as Policarpopulled it up the grooves . Chon Munoz stayed hidden behind the burladero . The second bull advanced down the runway uncertainly on its numb legs , head down , snorting , breathing the smell of the strange new hateful place . Trotting , it passed beyond the gate . Then cautiously it entered the big corral , lured by the sight and smell of its encierro mate . The two bulls squared off for a moment in the silence as if they must fight , then lost interest in each other and looked around , their ears cocked , hearing the sound of the truck from over the walls as it started to move again along the mouth of the chute . The third bull came fast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow leaving the box ; Chon showed himself as a lure again , and the bull bellowed as it went through the gate . Chon came around and swung it shut , grinning as he dropped the bolt into place . Gomez drove with Policarpo around the outside of the corrals and they parked the truck behind the walls of the horse patio . The dueno of the plaza was very anxious to join the aficionados on the platform who stood peering down at his bulls . " Well ! What do you think ? " he asked , sweating , comingup the steps . " Excellent , " said the Engineer Vilar , puffing his cigar . " Really Number Ones , " said Zeferino Ramos . " Too bad about that 23 , " said fat Rufino Vega . " Adamned buffalo . " " Ugly , it is true . Not aesthetic , " judged Don Alberto Iriarte . " But you do n't know anything , Rufino . Did n't you watch the way that bull came ? The way he went after Miguel ? The way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no lingering ? Ho ! He has got something behind those whiskers ! " " Casta , that 's what he 's got ! " Eladio Gomez said , proudly . " From the best cow at Las Astas . " " He 's got no tail , " Rufino Vega said . " Name of Jesus . You think a bull fights with the tail ? " asked the Engineer Vilar . They all stayed an hour , until the bulls had cooled , until the bulls were chewing quietly , in the blue shadows under the high curved wall . They liked to stand and just look at the bulls . Eladio Gomez walked alone to his office at dusk . It was in his mind to ask his Physicians of Plaza , please , to check again the condition , the equipment , of the infirmary . He could still feel those horns through the planking . Oh , there was something about the horns ! There was something about the dark bulls in the shadows at night . There was something about the bulls in the sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveled in style to Cuenca ; the swordhandlers were proud of the accommodationsthey had arranged to make the trip easy , after the emotions and uncertainties of the week . Luis and Pepe , with the sobresaliente Saya , occupied the drawing-room compartment on the Pullman , and each torero had his green-curtained berth to rest in during the night on the way . Such a trip was customarily a jaunt to enjoy , with beer and card games and high conversation ; with girls smiling and maybe willing ; with guitar music up ahead in the third class to pass the time , with people who knew how to eat sopes , chalupas , and fat gordas , singing on a poky train , proud to ride with valiant toreros . Very valiant . That was when things were going along . When times were good and the season held triumphs and Luis Bello was ready for them all . Then the cuadrillas felt ready too , and following the bulls was the life ! But it was n't the life on Saturday morning , the third of December , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fun they should be having , without having it , secretly matching their moods with a multitude of omens rememberedduring the week , from the scandal of the broken mirror Monday to the risk of a journey started on Friday . They watched the way Luis Bello sat so quiet on the green plush , staring out the window , forgetting to light his cigar . They did not say it , but it was on their minds every mile of the way : the corrida at Cuenca boded no good . Outside the morning sun beat down upon the brown earth and thorny brush that slid by along the right of way . It glared upon the dry glitter of the plain , it paled the blue sierra high beyond the speckled hills . A wind blew hard through the faraway sky , through the leafless trees by the wells and walls of lonesome ranchos , across winter fields and wide waste places , raising thin sad streamers of tan dust like mournful divisas.  |p187Luis  Bello felt hollow inside . Don Felix Aldemas , the son of a whore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He made going to Cuenca sound easy . He made Luis Bello ashamed , sitting in his parlor at San Angel , refusing to fight bulls . Luis Bello was torero , he said . He put my tail to the squeeze . He put me on this frilling train . That fat Aldemas  --  and Pepe that goat of a brother  --  they got together for the devil 's work . They got me to say I would . And here I am . A shadow reached out for him when he thought about it . Sometimes it made his heart beat fast , and a big lump come high in his throat . Yesterday he unfolded a cape again in his garden , just to see . His people ran the horns for him all morning . He sampled his timing as the cloth whirled , feeling how his legs held and handled under him , testing his wrists and the sinews moving , swinging the rag again , worried . And not a drink , not a drop of anything stronger than tea since Tuesday , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It was serious . Only tomorrow . All wrapped up in a package with the name , with the name framed in black . He had tried his escape from it ; he felt silly remembering . The package was coming on the horns tomorrow , and Luis Bello would reach out his hand then , and take it . He could take it . You damn right Luis Bello could take it , he hoped . The blue sierra was coming close ; Cuenca was not far . He would take it . He turned away from the empty land outside the window , and lighted his cigar . " Paco , " he said when the cigar was drawing well , " what you think of Mexico ? " He pointed out the window.  | " Dry and lonesome . Very frilling dry and lonesome . " " I drove horses through here when I was a kid . It 's drier and lonesomer than that . " " For the very soul of dryness and lonesomeness , " said Paco Saya , " you should sit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the complete sensation . " " What you need with the fish ? " the Jackdaw asked . " Jesus 's Apostles ! " Goyo Salinas said . " Remember the time we ran into the Spanish fish wagon , Luis ? That time in the car on the way from Santander ? God of mine , we smelled of fish for five corridas . I even caught ' em in my sox . The Aztec fishmongers , killing bulls at the fiestas of San Lucar ! Remember how the fans held their noses when we opened the capes at the tablas and how this damned Monkey Garcia would stand by the barrera making a face like a fish blowing bubbles ? " He slapped Garcia on the back of the neck . " We had some times in Spain , " Luis said . " You got a pretty good place for rascals , Paco . You got the atmosphereover there . It 's different here , for toreros . The only important atmosphere of the bulls in Mexico is in the Capital . Nobody pays any attention to corridas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Spain you got to be good in every wooden plaza to have real cartel ; in Mexico it do n't matter  --  except when you are on the make , when you are pointing . The only place where you are expected to really rip your drawers is in the Capital . The critics and the press rate you from there . " " A pity , " Paco said , " and I will tell you why . If the bulls are good , the plazas of the provinces are the places to get the real flavor of the dish . The great plazas make ap189grand spectacle , but the little ones without boxes , they are the ones for the true festival . Close up , intimate . That 's where you get the valor , the alegria right in your throat , in the little ones . " " Well , there 's some real bulls in the pens at Cuenca this morning , waiting for us . And the plaza there lacks boxes and Governors ' daughters with flowers in their hair . It 's little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alegria . " Luis felt the eyes of the cuadrilla when he said it . He felt their uneasiness . " We will , " Pepe Bello said . " We 'll arm the big father and senor of alegria . " " We 'll give them a package , " said the Jank . " Listen , Saya , when you going to start talking Spanish so people of decency understand what you say ? " " Father God . I speak it . You speak something else , I do n't know what , some barbarity of farmers . " " So that is Spanish , " said the Jank . " And I 'm a farmer . Imagine ! " " And the bull speaks also , " said Paco . " You know what he says ? He says , M000 ! ' " " I understand every word the bull says . " " You got the knowledges , Delgado . You know what the cows say ? " " I know what they answer when I say M000 ! ' " " When you sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you say Yai ! ' " " So soft , so smooth . " " God of my life , " said Luis Bello , " do we have to listen to the wind blowing the pigtails ? " " We are coming to Cuenca , " Pepe Bello said . " I can see the brewery . Four hours late on this slow freight . " " We got a Cuenca in Spain , " said Paco Saya . " Not one of the large pearls of the true virgin . " " You might find a pearl or a virgin in this Cuenca , maybe . But I doubt it , Paco , " Luis said . " Did you ever look for anything like that in Cuenca , Pepe ? This Cuenca ? " " No senor . I was just looking for the barrera , the time I was in this Cuenca . Loco Ruiz and I got sand in our shoes and holes in our pants . There was some little black pearls down behind the slaughterhouse , but no virgins , they told us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Pancho Perez , " but they probably wo n't . There 's fiesta in Cuenca , for the Saint . " " A feria ? " asked Paco . " Like in Spain ? " " Something like that . A carnival with popcorn and dancing . Not so fancy like Spain . " " Just as drunk , " smiled Monkey Garcia . " Maybe drunker . " " Impossible . " Luis Bello spoke up , looking around at the brown faces crowded in the compartment . " Listen . No drunks in these cuadrillas at Cuenca ! I 'm serious . You hear that ? We got work . We face bulls , and that 's tomorrow . " There were never any drunks in the cuadrillas on the night before a corrida . They decided Luis was talking to himself , aloud . It made an impression ; it brought a silence . " We 'll just look around at these Cuenca fiestas . " " You 'll see some big black things moving fast , tomorrow afternoon , without half looking , " Luis said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his foot.  |p191Tacho  knocked on wood , then saw it was metal . There was n't any real wood around . The train slowed coming into the switchyards , and the porter carried their bags to the vestibule , while they ran pocket combs through their hair , carefully , and adjusted their ties . " Cuenca , " said the conductor , stepping into the compartmentto shake the Bellos ' hands . " Luck tomorrow , " he said . " I wish I could be here to see it . " Eladio Gomez , with a spontaneous committee of welcome from the Plaza Club  --  and bars of less cartel  --  met them as they came down the steps . When the handshaking and the abrazos were done , the picadors picked up the long ash-wood shafts of their lances and held them like tall badges of their trade , in the middle of the crowd , while Tacho and the Little 0 hurried around the sword cases and cape baskets , hiring porters and haggling . " Our rooms are at the Europa , " Tacho said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the San Andres . " Salvador Cofino came pushing through the crowd , arrivinglate and out of breath . " Hola , Luis ! " He gave the matador an abrazo . " Let me take you in my car . " " Good . This is my brother Pepe  --  and Paco Saya , here , from Seville . " The cuadrillas , with the Little 0 in charge of their gear , got a ride with Rufino Vega , who drove them to the San Andres , the hotel on the side street not far from the station . Rufino was disappointed to carry only cuadrillas ; he had hoped for a matador.  | Breaking away from the crowd , the Bellos and Paco Saya climbed into Cofino 's car with Eladio Gomez and Tacho , who stowed the baggage , and they drove away . The gray stone facade of the Europa stood on the main plaza of Cuenca , looking out over the square , and across it , to the high tile-domed church of Santa Barbara . Cofino had difficulty getting his car to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carnival concessions jammed the sunny square and overflowed into the streets . They got out of the car to the sound of wheezy music from a carrousel and the jangling of church bells marking high noon above the murmur of the crowd . Idlers on the street spied the sword cases when Tacho lifted them from the car ; a crowd gathered around to gawk at the toreros and grin , while hotel porters took the baggage and led the guests inside . Cofino and Gomez went with them . Two big ramshackle connecting rooms on the second floor front were reserved for the matadors . Shuttered French doors opened out upon rusted ironwork balconies from both rooms , overlooking the color and movement and noise filling the square . " Day of fiesta , " Cofino said as they watched it . " The people come in from the whole district for today and tomorrow . " Racket tonight , in the middle of this , " Luis remarked . " There will be a little noise , " Gomez admitted , " but you will rest well . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tomorrow at noon you can see the procession from here , " said Cofino , " when they take Santa Barbara out , and parade her around the square . "  |p193Tacho  spoke . He was interested . " Senor , will you tell the reason for this celebration of the Saint ? " " She saved the town once , " Eladio Gomez offered . " She stopped an earthquake when they paraded her . That 's what they say , anyway . The trembling stopped and she saved the town . Long ago . God knows how long . The town celebrates it . " Cofino said , " I do n't know how much of the fiestas you care for , Luis , but I would be glad to take you around . This afternoon are cockfights , rodeo , five hundred vara horse races . Carnival tonight with dancing at the Casino and all the rest of it . The Indians dance on the street with torches . Whatever you like , we are at your orders . " " I am grateful , senor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But those races , for example . I used to work horses like that when I was a kid  --  " " Certainly , " Cofino said . " We 'll see them , and everything you like . " " I 'd like to see the Las Astas , " Pepe said . " I 'm going over to the ring . The cuadrillas will probably be over there . I want to see those bulls . " " Luis , " Gomez put in , " and Pepe  --  we have arranged a little dinner of aficionados at the Plaza Club tonight . Very simple . Just to wish you well . The radio will be there , for you to say a few words to the fans of Cuenca . Just a few words . It will stir them . May we have the honor ? " " How not , Senor Gomez ? But we can leave early ? Becauseof tomorrow  --  " " Exactly , diestro , " Gomez said . " Plenty of rest . I will go now . The plaza keeps me busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am sure . The dinner is at nine . "  | " I must leave now myself , " said Cofino . " Wait for me here at three o'clock . We will see the fiestas . " " Until then , " Luis said . " Say , " Paco Saya said when their callers had gone , " this Cuenca is not so bad ! " " Eehah ! " Pepe grinned , looking at the crowd down in the square . " In fact  --  " " Gala . " Luis spit over the balcony . " So merry . " " Let 's eat , " Pepe said , " and then go see the bulls ! Eehoh ! I want to see them . How about you , Luis ? " " I 'll see them tomorrow . They 'll be there . " " At four o'clock sharp , in the afternoon , " Paco quoted , brightly . " The most beautiful festival of all . " Callers began to knock on the door , to see the Swordsmanof Guerreras , to shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRIGHT Saturday afternoon sun , the city of Cuenca partook of the fiestas of its patron Santa Barbara . Dwellers in the hard world of daily bread shut the doors of toil behind them that afternoon , according to custom , and walked out into the light . The ropers and riders raised a great dust over the wooden stands and corrals on the charro grounds where rodeo unfolded with music . Horses unlimbered for the five o'clock races along the quarter-mile track in the mesquite at the edge of town . The sun filtered pale through the white canvas cover of the Cuenca cockpit where bettors screamed their odds and handlers petted their baleful fowls , blowing down their throats , in the thick smell of damp dust and sweat and stale beer . The carrousel and Ferris wheel made their turns to the sounds of their whiffing musics in the swarming plaza where the urchins squealed and citizens promenaded in holiday noise and carnival smell by the street stalls where food was frying . The pink lemonade , the popcorn , the brown sugar and quince candy , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the bars of Cuenca crammed full and loud , tuned up like strings on the mariachis ' guitars , for an evening . Fiesta was in the air over Cuenca as the shadows grew longer and the sunlight turned yellow above the violet western sierra . Eladio Gomez , with fiesta all around him , was busy as a man tending bar . At his bullring he watched the completion of a thousand details , giving orders . Chon and Miguel finished dragging the plaza , leveling up the low place with new sand in front of the cuadrilla gate . They got out the hoses then , and began wetting down the wide tan circle to make the footing firm and smooth for tomorrow . The sweepers with Vicente finished cleaning the stands ; Sanchez'snew paint looked fine and bright . Jacinto had the little flags fixed , sixty of them for around the top of the plaza , and the red and yellow TOROS banner for the pole ,  |p197clean  and ready . Eladio Gomez checked over the list of memos he carried in his pocket , crossing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all delivered , stacked in the storeroom by the plaza entrance . The block was installedin the hoist by the hooks , for the plaza butcher who would be busy tomorrow beyond the arrastre ; the meat of the four Las Astas was contracted for . Gomez rehearsed the new head usher and his crew . He tested the blue neon light over the chapel altar ; it pleased him , with all the new flowers . The infirmary was scrubbed , smelling of carbolic acid . Landeros delivered his flea-bitten nags for the picadors , and promised to bring the three rented mules to Chon Munoz in the morning . In the midst of the exertionsaround them , the bulls of Las Astas chewed quietly on their cuds . Gomez was proud when Pepe and five of the Bello cuadrillas arrived at the plaza pens to see those bulls . The impresario stood listening curiously while the toreros and Policarpo Cana argued the points of each animal , in preparation for the sorting and the drawing of lots for each matador , in the morning . When Gomez went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither dim nor lonely . The line of ticket buyers in front of Lara 's box office window brought the fiesta feeling almost into Gomez 's heart . It warmed him . If only the weather held . If only the sun were strong . If only the wind did not blow . 0 Sainted Christ of the Conversion of the Good Robber , Eladio Gomez , you might fill your plaza ! A full house to watch Luis Bello work with Las Astas . He picked up the phone on his desk and called to be sure about the sound truck with the loud-speaker . It was ready , with the signs . It would play bullfight music by the carnival square for an hour tonight , and through the streets of Cuenca for three hours before the corrida tomorrow . " Tune it loud , " said Eladio Gomez . Up the street at the Plaza Club aficionados gathered . For them there was one theme worthy of consideration in the fiestas of Santa Barbara . They drank over it , savoringit in advance . " The mob does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the Engineer Vilar . " Much less those gringo tourists , leaving after the second bull in the Mexico . " " No fiesta for tourists and neurotic girls , " Zeferino Ramos stated . " The flavor is strong . " " Aficionados of the true red bone are often ignorant of the meaning of our festival , " the Engineer said , sipping his manzanilla . " It is true that all the arts are surrounded by cults and loose tongues embroidering upon meanings far removed from the impulses that give birth to those arts . It is nevertheless necessary to have philosophy to view an art with understanding . " " Let me remind you , Engineer , " Santana said , " that most of the human race are far from considering bullfightingan art . To them it is a bloody sport , a debased and uselessviolence . " " A good point , Santana , " old Alberto Iriarte said . " Let us go farther into this inquiry of the Engineer 's phi-losophy . " " For that matter , " the Engineer said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being as art . Art grows from what is first a utility or a pastime . The festival of the bulls , for instance , grew from both . First it was a hunt for meat in the mountains of Spain , and then later a sporting pas/time for horsemen armed with lances , before spectators . But it developed . In the beginning , music was perhaps no more than grunting while beating two sticks together , and painting was the daubing of dots on cave walls and jugs . They are more than that now . And a corrida de toros is more than a sport . " " It is of course necessary , " old Iriarte put in , " to understandour festival is not a sport but a spectacle . It is a form of drama as certainly as the works of Sophocles . But what a difference between the happenings on a stage or in a poem , and the happenings in a plaza ! " " Exactly , " the Engineer said . " The festival of the bulls is the only art form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfeigned . It is the only art in which the artist deals actual death and risks actual death , as if a poet were called upon to scan his lines with his life . It is the contemplation of this visible violence and actual death that gives the art its peculiar power , gentlemen . " " It is also that actuality which confuses the art with sport and confounds foreigners who find real blood a revulsion  --  or a morbid thrill , " Santana said . " All arts , even the most abstract , " Don Alberto broke in again , " are essentially creations to thrill . To allow man to participate in God 's designs at one step removed from the anguish of living them . Sitting safely in a chair . " " The heart of the matter is this , " said the Engineer . " There is enormous difference between the thrill given by art and the thrill given by watching merely exciting forms of peril . The difference , let us say , between a corrida de toros and a motorcycle race . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Violence , or peril ,  |p200made  significant by art amplifies the sensation beyond the body , distills it , lifts it above the realm of mere incident . A corrida de toros , by that token of art , presents us with a moving image and symbol of our own hearts grappling with violence and death . Can this be a sport ? Unless , indeed , man facing his destiny is sport , combat between equals . No ! In the plaza the man lives , by his bravery , and the bull dies . Sometimes it is another case , but that is not the plan of our festival which is designed to show the glory of courage over the power of death . Each of us reads into this theme our private response . It is that meaning of man face to face with the inner and outer brute force of living , and man 's tragedy in dealing death while subject to it himself , which has gripped the mind and emotion of the Latin race . " " Do you know what Juan Belmonte said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said , And at the end of a faena , when my enemy was exhausted and caring no longer for the trouble of the muleta , and I had to mount the sword , then it gave me compassion , then I felt pity , feeling pain and remorse that I must kill my bull , such a noble beast , that many times pardoned my life and in return for that pardon I only sent him away forever from his green and happy pastures . ' " " It explains our feelings when we leave a plaza , " Zeferino Ramos said . " We have seen it , the tragic brave festival . " " Who speaks of brave festival ? " Meliton Esparza asked , walking up to their table in his ranch clothes , a tequila in his thick hand . " I like to sit there in the sun with a bottle and hear that bugle blow ! I like to see a freight trainp201come out of the door and scare the Sainted Jesus out of those frilling dolls waving their pretty rags ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whistle when the devil gets unchained . Ole for the festival ! " He slapped his pistol . " Is it going to be a good one tomorrow , Zeferino ? " " How not ? " " I just got to town . Are the bulls big ? " " Big enough . " " Who are these Bellos with the pretty name ? " He drained his tequila and called Carlos for another . " Are the Bellos any good , Don Alberto ? Or are they some more of those dolls in the gold panties ? " Old Iriarte frowned . " Meliton , you get brutish in the sierras . You ought to come to town more often . " " About the panties ? " Meliton grinned . " That 's why I came ! But without the gold . Just pink . Eeehoh ! It 's dead in this tomb with your festival . " He banged down his glass and swaggered out the door . " That son of a whore should bait bears , " Benito Bombachsaid , watching Esparza go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Don Alberto ? I just saw Luis , out at the races with Salvador Cofino . " " There has been no killer of bulls like him since Luis Freg . On a good afternoon , Luis Bello is ample with the cape , immense with the muleta , enormous with the sword . At the Hour of Truth , when he goes in to kill , there is no one like him . " " He gives the tragedy . All alone , out there . Nobody can work closer to the horns . " " But he has been lacking lately . He was frankly bad at Guadalajara . "  | " He has been sluggish since the leg wound in September . That benefit performance at Irapuato . I saw it . " " And did you hear about the girl , the one killed with Fuentes ? She absolutely was , they say . " " I know . A double blow . Has Cofino ever told you about Fuentes and Bello ? They were very close . Bello is from the humble , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decency . Taught him how to read , how to dress ; he even taught him how to eat at table . And took care of his money . What a blow ! " " The bulls punish Luis Bello . My God , but they punish him . They will get him someday . " " What about the kid brother ? How do you like Pepe ? " " You remember him here , the summer before last . I saw him in Mexico too . Regular . A nice boy , but only regular . It 's rare to have two good ones in a family . " " Don Alberto , what do you think of Pepe Bello ? " " I think some words of Sanchez de Neira in his classic dictionary of bulls . He wrote of a young man just beginning of whom there is yet little to say . He has gained a certain name for courage , but those valiant among men are not always so among bulls . ' We will judge tomorrow . " The hours toward tomorrow unwound to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sky above it , but the Bello cuadrillas were guided by nearer lights when they left the San Andres to find their suppers and sample the celebrations before they went to bed . Tomorrow was a constraint upon them . It held them together like a group of tourists from another world . They only stood upon the edges of the festivities , like wry inspectors , eating in a crowded cafe , hearing music , eyeing the girls on prome/nade , watching the Indians dance by torchlight to the squeaking of fiddles and thumping of drums , and milling in the aimless crowd around the lighted booths draped in bunting by the entrance to the Casino . " What is the use of it ? " the Jank asked Goyo Salinas . " For me , the spark ai n't working . The engine 's dead to-night . " " My sad life is just bread and bulls . Let 's find a bar and have a few beers and then go to bed . Come on , Pancho . " " Eehah , did you see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A front like a plaza de toros ! Did you say go to bed , Goyo ? " " Reminds me of a girl back home , " said the young banderillero Enrique , sadly . " In Cusi . " " There he goes with Cusi , " the Little White said . " Give us the name of your town again , Enrique . It illuminates the soul and puts musicians to work . " " Cusi , Cusihuiriachic . " " I been there . It 's nothing , " the Jackdaw said . " It 's a name , " said the Little White . " They call it Cusi to save time and not be late for dinner . " " It do n't matter , " said the Jackdaw . " They do n't eat much in Cusi . I did n't . " " Let 's get the hell out of Cusi and into a saloon , " the Jank said . They found a bar where there were chairs to sit on , and musicians singing in the smoky light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed the tune , Goyo banged his fist down on the table . " There goes that frilling funeral again ! Enrique ! Go tell them to play something else orp204I 'll stick a puntilla down their throats . " The musicians were singing that new ballad , " The Tragedy of Juan Salazar . " Pancho Perez knocked on wood . " A dead bull has no horns , " he mumbled . " Big mosquitoes with long stingers tomorrow , " Enrique said . " Have you seen the racks of sorrow we ride here ? " the Soup asked , rubbing his head . " I spit in the milk . " " The picador 's complaint . They ought to write a song about that . " They drank their beer quietly in all the noise , and ordered again . " Goyo , " said Pancho Perez , looking down in his glass ,  --  you and I know that sometimes in the plaza the bull is the one that knows the most . When the bull knows he is going to get us , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicup in the stands do n't hear what the bull is saying . They do n't know his bad intentions . So they whistle . Now between a whistle the wind carries away , and a horn wound you carry away , which is the most acceptable ? The boo passes , the wound remains . I am glad we are peons and do not make the choice . I am getting old .  --  " The hell with bulls at night , like this , " said the Soup . " They 're enough when the sun is shining . " " Jackdaw , " the Jank said , " how does it feel in Cuenca , away from the pearl of Mesones Street ? You think she misses you ? " " She is probably having fiestas of her own tonight , " said Monkey Garcia.  | " To fight bulls or stay married to a pearl , you got to stand close , " the Little White remarked . " Bulls are safer , " the Jackdaw stated . " He has angels in the mouth , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most problem of the complete creation . " " I could solve a problem tonight , " Monkey Garcia said . " I wish I had a complete problem in my lap . Listen to that complete music ! " " The girls and the bulls , " the Little White said . " They hook . " " What an age for toreros , " the Jank said . " With the Father and Senor Penicillin ! " " That 's the name of the stuff I was telling you ! " Goyo said . " For the hookings . " " There 's no future in this saloon , " Monkey said . " Shall we have another round ? Or go ? " They saw Luis Bello out on the street . " Where 's Pepe and the Flower of Seville ? " the Jank asked . Luis looked the cuadrillas over , estimating their condition . He was very sober . " You on your way ? " he asked . " Yes , " Goyo said . " I 'm giving a little circuit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I 'm making myself some sleep , " Luis told them . " We just finished the dinner . Pepe and Paco are giving their own little turn . " Back in his room at the Europa , Luis Bello told Tacho to keep the rooms quiet , by God , in the morning ; to keep the crowd out ; he wanted rest . Tacho and Abundio left him then , and he undressed and turned off the light and got in bed . The glow and the sound of the carnival pene- trated the shutters on the balcony doors and came into his room . He heard the bells jangle on the church tower of Santa Barbara , announcing midnight . The mechanical musicfrom the carrousel and Ferris wheel stopped ; but there were flurries of song and he heard laughter and voices passing in the streets . The carnival came to him from far away , from the other side of the moon , and stopped on the edge of his mind . Looking up at the slits of light reflected on the high dark ceiling he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if from up there Luis Bello stood looking down untroubled upon himself . Stretched out flat upon the bed , he felt the soundness of his body , somehow proud of this care he gave it , this rest , this complete sobriety . It pleased him as if he were fulfilling some honorable obligation . He closed his eyes but sleep would not come . The fiestas in the gardens of San Marcos . It was long ago . He saw the blue flowers on the jacaranda trees against the blue sky . He smelled the springtime and felt the new green leaves in the garden where the music played . He saw the blue dusk settling upon the streets of Aguascalientes duringcarnival time in the spring , and the people all walking and laughing to the gardens where the colored lanterns began to glow beneath the darkening trees while the music played . He saw the girls again , walking arm in arm and smiling , with the fiestas in their eyes and confetti caught in their hair , in the lantern light with the music playing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fiestas in the spring at the gardens of San Marcos ! He saw the slender girl again walking in the light and he heard her say her name was Barbara and he felt her move and sway whenp207they danced . He could see her smile when the guitars played " Maria Elena . " In the spring of the year . The bullring in the fall that year , there at San Marcos by the fiesta grounds . How he dedicated the first bull . The first pertaining to Luis Bello , Matador de Toros . " To thee , Barbara , I dedicate this bull . " How many hundred bulls and dedications since then ! How he killed that first one for her and how they carried him from the ring on their shoulders , and he saw her smile at him that night . The days when I was thirsty . When I drank it all and my throat was never full . Oh I was thirsty . Thirsty for the bulls in those times . I killed a seventh bull in my head after every corrida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought two whole corridas more , complete . I kept on fighting bulls in dreams and when the morning came I wished I could put on my suit of lights ! Luis Bello , Matador de Toros . Thirsty for the bulls . The fame , the shouts , the smiles , the money , the drinks , the girl . And I had them . I had them , every one . In the days and nights before I made mysteries in my head . In the times before I cared about the horns . He heard the door open in the next room , Pepe and the Spanish kid coming in from the fiestas . Coming to their hotel room in a town named Cuenca , on the night before they might get killed , coming in laughing , late , in the times before they ever cared about the horns . Luis Bello shifted his body on the bed . Standing up there outside of himself so strangely , he looked down at himself so full of care . Jesus and Mary , when I was a kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was going to do them . And sometimes I did . I never wondered then if I could do as good as I did before . In those days what I done before was n't enough , and when it ever gets to be enough , I 'm finished . That 's the way to say it , what there is about the bulls ! I tried to tell Linda there was something about it and she called me proud when it was n't that . I did n't know the words to say it then , exactly what it was about the bulls . It 's knowing what you can do out there alone . It 's feeling what you got inside and doing it the best you can , regardless . I did n't get to tell her that , but I know it , here in this frilling Cuenca . And the only way to fight bulls is not in bed alone in the dark , but by God in a plaza at four o'clock in the afternoon , when the horns are not so big.  |p209THE  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awoke Luis Bello . They were answered by church bells in the distance . The sound of bells came to his room from many directions , from all over the city of Cuenca , answering the bells of Santa Barbara . Luis Bello awoke in the strange room sharply aware . The light that came past the shutters now was not the colored lantern light of carnival ; it was the light of the sun in the sky . It came through the closed lids of his eyes to rob him of the securityof dark sleep so that he lay in a waking grayness tinged with the redness of his blood . The pale ghost red behind his lids was alive and impatient , now that the day was here . He opened his eyes and looked at his watch . Eight hours and twenty minutes . Then the red door would open . He stared at the ceiling high above his head , feeling four o'clock coming . Slow , and yet fast too . With the package . He lay in bed waiting , with his eyes open , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock , a tentative , padded , familiar knock on the door . It was Tacho . " Hola ! How about a little tea , Luis ? Something warm to start the day . How 's that leg ? " " It caught a knot when I first woke up , but it 's all right . " Tacho came into the room with the tea . " Have it , Luis , and then let me rub the leg . We 'll limber it . Three letters for you this morning . I have a kid posted outside your door . I told him I would kill him if he let anybody disturb you while I 'm in here and ca n't watch . " Luis drank the tea , sitting on the side of the bed , while he opened the letters . Two of them were the kind he got in every town ; the paper of one was pink and scented , the other pale violet . It was so enormous to have Luis Bello in Cuenca . There would be prayers and applause for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrate the triumph afterward , of course it was toop211much to hope for , but at the Casino after ten o'clock to the right of the entrance door inside , with a red carnation in the hair . . . Luis Bello had to smile while he opened the third letter , typewritten on white paper , unscented . The writer begged only a moment of the diestro 's time , a moment of great portent and fortune . The writer had discovered a gold mine . If Luis Bello cared to . . . " Here 's a gold mine if you want to get rich , " Luis said . " The others are probably pure gold too . " " On the front teeth , " Tacho said . He had the liniment in his hand . " Let 's work with the leg . " The door opened from the adjoining room . " How goes the big Luis ? " It was Pepe , grinning . He and Paco were in their undershirts . " We join you for tea ? " He crooked his finger with elegance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more cups . They drank sitting around Luis 's bed , while Tacho rubbed the leg . " The wind , " Paco mentioned , relaxed , looking out the balcony doors . " Have you noticed the filthy wind ? It 's blowing . " " It will stop , " Pepe said . " It is n't allowed . " Luis pointed to the colored letters on the bed . " There 's some literature for you boys . Faenas after the plaza closes . " " I got one , " Pepe said . " In green ink . " At ten-thirty there was another knock on the door from the hall . Tacho answered ; it was Goyo and Pancho , the peons of confidence . Goyo looked at his matador , sampling the spirit of the day . " How goes , Luis ? " " Not bad . Cuadrillas bright ? "  | " Innocent and strong as boys . Pancho and I came to ask you and Pepe about sorting , and drawing the lots . You want to leave it in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfriendly , or you want us to set it up ? We seen the bulls . " " The show is for Pepe , " Luis said . " Give him the cream . " " They are paying to see you , Luis , " his brother said . " You ought to work the top stuff . You take them . They areall because of you . " " A bull is a bull , " Luis said . " Are they fairly even ? " " There 's one son of a phenomenon that got out of a zoo . The others are even . " " Well , " Luis said , " let 's run it on the level . ' What you say , Pepe ? Pair them even and really draw . How 's that ? " " Suits me . They all got horns . " " And none are children , " Pancho Perez said . " The pits are going over with us to try the horses . There will be some knots on the heads of picadors tonight , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had their breakfasts brought to the room . They each had more tea , a fried egg with chili , a slice of bread , and an orange to finish . They ate very slowly . It was all the food they could have until after the corrida . Tacho opened the balcony doors and the noise of the crowd in the square filled the room with babble and murmurof holiday and expectation . A gust of wind slammed one of the doors shut suddenly while the matadors were eating . No one said a word ; Tacho propped the door open again with a chair.  | " They are going to have the Saint out at noon , " remarkedthe Little O.The boy on guard outside the door allowed another knock . It was the aficionado Cofino , carefully dressed in double-breasted tailoring with wide shoulders . He was smiling . " I just came to see if I could do anything for you this morning . If you needed anything . " The matadors thanked him , chewing . Luis indicated a chair . " Please sit down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scowling , and stepped outside , closing the door . " Eladio Gomez is going to fill his plaza this afternoon , " Cofino said . " We have the sun in Cuenca , with the Bellos and Las Astas ! " " Can you do something about the breeze ? " Cofino laughed . " I 'm having it stopped . I 'm using in-fluence . " They could hear angry voices outside the door . Tacho came back in , shaking his head . " What 's that ? " Luis asked him . " The same old stuff . " Tacho grinned . " Two crazies . With two of the reliables . Barcelona to Cuenca , always the crazies ! One with a love drink , guaranteed . The other with the rare powder . Dust it in the muleta , the bull is yours . No risk , no trouble . Scientific ! God of my life ! I had to insult them to get them to go away . " " You really should have bought some , " Pepe said . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls . Eehah ! "  | " Imagine ! " Cofino said . " I must go . It 's time for the procession and I must find my family . " They all stood and Cofino embraced each torero , saying , " Have luck ! " When he had gone , the bells began to ring . The three matadors walked out upon the balcony , into the sun . The whole plaza was jammed . A cheer went up as the gilded palanquin of Santa Barbara , borne on the shoulders of a dozen bearers , came out of the church door , through the iron gate and into the crowd . A banging salute of guns joined the bells and the shouting . A band of mariachis took their places leading the litter of the Saint , with little girls in white dresses following , throwing flowers in the path of Santa Barbara . When the bells stopped their ringing , there were the shouts and the music of the mariachis , coming around the plaza , the Viva la Santa ! Viva Santa Barbara Patrona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the little girls throwing the flowers . The Saint came around past the balcony where the toreros stood , and they saw her clearly . Santa Barbara was a framed painting of a solemn pretty girl with a great gold halo . She stood by a dark tower with three windows , and by a cannon , and behind her were storm clouds with a lightning flash . She was calm in the midst of her picture , in the midst of her storm , in the midst of the noise of Cuenca . The plinking , jigging , fiddling , thumping strings of the mariachis beat a solid swinging tempo in the shouting . It was the music of the Mexican heart pounding in the sunlight as the Saint went by . " Making a circuit ! " Pepe yelled . " Touring the ring ! Taking an ovation ! " It was a good sign , for a change.  | " Que alegria ! " the Spaniard Paco was shouting . " Viva la Patrona , la Santisima Barbara ! " When she came back to the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Cuenca gave her another Viva , the loudest one of all , for another year . As they watched the crowd dissolving from the plaza , the three toreros on the balcony heard bullfight music . A sound truck came around the corner , racking out a paso doble of the bulls . On the sides of the truck were gaudy big lithographs of Luis Bello . " Ole ! " said Paco Saya . " After the Saint , the Swords-man ! " " Christ in His pain ! " Luis said . He went inside . Focusing his eyes in the dimness , he saw that Tacho had been busy . There on a chair , laid out according to ritual and with formal care , he saw his suit of lights waiting for him , blue and gold . A black band of mourning was sewn upon the left sleeve of the jacket . Outside the bullfightmusic stopped abruptly and Luis Bello heard the raspingof his name . At the Plaza de Toros of Cuenca , at four o'clock sharp . The chair with the glittering traje @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . Upon the table Tacho had opened a flat leather case and set up a colored image of La Virgen de Guadalupe and lighted a votive candle by it . At the side of the image he had placed the silver talismans of the Virgin and of Santa Barbara , strung on a thin gold chain . They were always placed so , by the traje , before every corrida ; no one could touch anything there , no one but Luis Bello and Tacho his servant of swords , until after the matador was all dressed for the ring . No one . It was something Luis Bello felt very strongly . It was one of his ways of dealing with the horns . At a quarter to one a barber came to shave the matadors and trim their hair before they dressed . He had finished with Luis , and just lathered Pepe 's face , when Goyo and Pancho came to report their sorting of the bulls and the results of drawing the lots from a hat . Luis was in a bathrobeready to go down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We took the two that looked the best , " Goyo explained , " and paired them each with one of less promise . " The matadors were listening hard . Pancho said , " The lots are about even . " " Who got which ? " " Luis got the big Number 74 and the ugly one with the whiskers . You got the pretty Number 37 and the one with the spread horns . " " Which one of mine comes out first ? " Luis asked . " I 'm sorry about it , Luis , " his peon said . " As the first and the third of the afternoon pertain to you , I wanted to get the ugly one out of the way so you could hit the summit with your final bull . But the dueno Gomez was afraid . He was scared to run the ugly first . He said the crowd would howl . He insisted on 74 to begin . So you got a freight train first and a buffalo last . " " A bull is a bull . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bathrobe pockets . " This is Pepe 's show . " " How do mine come out ? " Pepe asked . The barber had quit trying to shave him . " The right way , " Pancho said . " The wide horns first and the 37 to close plaza with a sweet taste . "  | " We have to hurry now and dress , " Goyo said . " I hope we did good . " " Sure , " Luis said . " Thanks . " He went to take his shower while Pepe and Paco were barbered . When Luis came back , Tacho had the room cleared , ready for the dressing . It was a careful ceremony and it took time . The matador first went over to the table , made the sign of the cross , then put the gold chain over his head and around his neck so that the medals were on his chest . They were cold for a moment . The clean cotton underwear came to his elbows and knees , fitting snug , and it looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the side of the rumpled bed . Tacho knelt on the floor and put white stockings on the matador 's bare feet . The stockings met the underwear above the knees . Luis pulled them up and secured them with ring garters of white elastic . Over the white stockings went the outer pink ones  --  the color of " rosy times in our history long past , " as a Spanish bull critic once wrote  --  and Tacho smoothed them up to the garters and Luis fastened them tight . The swordhandler put his master 's stockinged feet through the legs of the taleguilla , the skin-tight gold-embroideredbreeches , and Luis stood while they tugged , working and smoothing the breeches up the legs . To accomplishthe final " mounting of the taleguilla " Tacho called Abundio into the room . The two swordhandlers rolled a towel and Luis straddled it , with the helpers holding it tight at both ends . " Do n't touch him . " Tacho warned the Little O. " Just hold the end of the towel . "  | Riding down hard on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the breeches up snugly to where it belonged . Leaving the waist unbuttoned , he sat down then and extendedone leg at a time while Tacho fastened the breeches below the knees , pulling them shut and tying them with the machos , the gold-tasseled drawstrings that held the bottoms tight around the legs . Standing again , Luis got into the white shirt with the embroidery down the front . Instead of tucking in the shirttail , Tacho folded it up evenly all around so that it came only a little below the waist . He held it in place while Luis buttoned his breeches over it . " I 'm thinner , " Luis said . The waist was not as tight as usual . Tacho did not answer . He got down and put the soft-soled heelless black slippers , the zapatillas , on Luis 's doublestockingedfeet . Looking in the mirror , Luis tied his crimson necktie of narrow satin . Tacho put a sash of the same crimson about the matador 's waist . It was a single tight turn of silk to cover the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in place , Luis sat while Tacho carefullywound a lock of the hair on the back of Luis 's head around a flat clip and fastened to it the anadido , the torero 's artificial pigtail mounted on the black velvet button . Luis shook his head hard , to see if the anadido was secure . Satisfied , he stood up and put on the brocaded vest and buttoned it over the sash . Then Tacho held the dozen pounds of gold-embroidered , tasseled , epauletted jacket while Luis got into it , snugging it up to the back of his neck , and hep219was dressed for the plaza . On the chair there remained only the montera , the torero 's black hat with the bulges at the sides , and the elaborate silk cape for the parade into the ring . Tacho did not touch them . " I 'm dry , " Luis said . " Get me water . I 'm very dry . " When he had taken a swallow , he rinsed his mouth and squirted the water on the floor . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limes to squeeze in the water jugs this afternoon ? I 'm dry . " Before a corrida , he was always dry ; the more nervous he was , the drier . He must be very nervous , he decided , remembering a phrase . He could remember the dry way Manolete said it , sitting by him on the way to the plaza , " the battle of nerves we suffer . " Luis walked to the mirror and looked at himself , straightening his tie . That the battle wo n't show ! That I keep it hidden like the Cordoban . " All right , Tacho . " The swordhandler crossed himself and left the room . In accordance with his ritual , Luis Bello was alone , in his suit of lights . There was a physical way a man felt , trussed and weighted and strange in such dress , with all the lower body gripped in glistening tightness , with the arms and shoulders housed and burdened in stiff gold , with the feet queerly light and tender in the pliant slippers and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the way a man felt in his heart . Luis Bello 's heart was pounding too fast . He heard the voices on the square outside , and the hum of the town on its way to the plaza de toros , and he stepped to the balcony door to see about the wind . There was n't any . The trees were nearly still now , in the bright sun . It was five minutes to three , it was almost time . Beyond the bell tower of the church across the plaza , the sky was empty blue , the color of his traje , without the gold . He turned back into the dim room and walked to the table where the wax burned in the red glass by the familiar image . He got down on his knees . Oh , he was dry ! The words came dry in his mouth . Holy Virgin of Guadalupe . Queen of Mexico and my sweet Mother , he always began it . Give me the grace of thy protection and the good luck . Save me from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thee to the end of life . Amen . When he had said it , it did not seem enough but it was all that came . Amen . He got up , dusting his knees , and took the black montera from the chair . Holding it with both hands , he pressed it down firmly on his head , low and straight across his brow . Then he folded the parade cape across his left arm carefully , and walked out of the door without looking back . Tacho was waiting in the hall , with the boy who watched the door . " One moment , Luis , and we will go . " Tacho went into the room and came out with the sword case , the towels , and the water jug . He had his old tweed cap on , for luck . " We are ready , " he called to Abundio , opening the door to the next room , and Pepe and the Spaniard , both smiling , joined Luis . Pepe was dressed in his new traje of lilac and silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his teeth very white . He had the black band sewn on his arm . Paco Saya was smoothly rigged in bottle green and gold . Tacho , with a sword case under his arm , led the processiondown the worn stone steps and into the high glassed/over patio that formed the lobby of the Hotel Europa . Luis followed , then Pepe and Paco , with Abundio and his swords , and the boy who watched the door and was now promoted to carry water jugs and towels bringing up the rear . The toreros made a dazzling show of color in the gray stone lobby ; there was a round of hand clapping and femininesounds of admiration from the crowd gathered there , and out on the sidewalk , to watch the toreros depart for the ring . They got into the back seat of a car waiting for them at the curb . The swordhandlers and their assistant caught a taxi on the corner . Now was the nervous time . The Bellos and Paco Saya had little to say , riding together through the Sunday streets to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the Spaniard observed . " A day for the bulls , " Pepe said . " The sun is the grand torero , at the top of every cartel . " The street leading to the ring was crowded . They sat silent driving up to the shadow of the curved wall , with the noise and the movement growing around them . They could hear the band playing . They could feel the sunlit crowd and the color , the hurry , the tension , and it entered into them as they got out of the car by the horse patio gate . The cuadrillas were waiting for them inside , rigged in their trajes , ready . " All set , " Goyo reported to Luis . The picadors were adjusting saddles on three nags and tightening the heavy quilted pads slung under the horses ' bellies . " You think they can still stand up when you get on ? " Paco laughed . It irritated the Little White , who was sweating under his wide beaver hat , and breathing hard . " You help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " They 'll stand up . Christ of the Good Death , they got to stand ! " Tacho and Abundio arrived with the sword cases and the assistants carrying the cape baskets . They went down the cuadrilla passageway that led from the patio under the stands and beyond the gate into the ring , where they walked around the callejon to the burladero on the other side of the plaza , to lay out the capes and unfurl the muletas and ready the swords . They left one of the gates partly open , and Luis could see through the tunnel under the stands out to where the sunlight shone on the empty sand in the ring , and the stands on the other side where he saw the crowd packing in . Eladio Gomez came through the open cuadrilla gate and up the tunnel to where the matadors stood . He was smiling . " We 're filling the plaza ! " he said . He gave each matador an abrazo and a " Have luck ! " The impresario of Cuenca looked well and smelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stands over his head and it went to his heart . Old Don Alberto Iriarte entered the patio with a companion and walked directly to the Bellos . " See who honors us , " said Don Alberto . Luis turned . " Don Marcelo ! " The man with Iriarte was Marcelo Cadena , the eminent critic of bulls for La Lidia of Mexico . He gave Luis an abrazo and a cigar . Don Alberto introduced him to Eladio Gomez , then to Pepe and to Paco Saya . " An accident brought me , " the portly critic said . " I had to go to the North this week on private affairs . Coming backp223I heard of the corrida and got off the train this morning to attend . I never miss Luis Bello ! " " Magnificent ! " said Eladio Gomez , expanding . He sawvisions of propaganda in La Lidia . " Will you be my guestin the callejon , or would you rather sit in the first row ? " " I will sit with Don Alberto , thank you , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcelo . " " Don Marcelo , " Luis Bello said , " I am glad you came . To see my brother Pepe with real bulls . " " I will be watching , " the critic stated . Eladio Gomez was hoping the matadors would use his plaza chapel . He was proud of it , and he pointed to its door at the end of the patio . " Perhaps now you would like to make devotions , " he suggested to the toreros , looking at his watch . " Twenty-five until four . " " Thank you , " Luis said . He turned to his brother . " I 'd like to go last . If you and Paco now  --  " Luis stood with his face set , trying to be cool , and easy , waiting for Pepe and Paco to come out of the chapel . Aficionados found their way into the patio , and there were hands to shake and faces to be pleasant to , while he waited for the chapel door to open . When Pepe and Paco reappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The flash bulbs blinked . Then Luis went in the chapel and closed the door . He went in wanting to be alone , and as soon as he was alone he was sorry . The blue line of neon arching over the altar , and the candles burning at either side of the Guadalupe , were the only light . In a niche on a side wall he saw the image of Jesus del Gran Poder . The noise of the plaza was completely shut away . In the silence he put down hisp224cape and the montera , and knelt at the rail before the altar . The words came to him . Holy Virgin of Guadalupe , my Mother . Who remained brave seeing the suffering of Thy Son . By the sword of sorrow that went into your heart that day , and by the rewardyou now take in Heaven , look down from the Throne and hear my prayer . Shelter me in your blessed mantle . Give me courage in the moments of great peril . Amen . When he had said Amen , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More words came to Luis Bello. 0 Father Jesus of the Great Power , Saviour and Redeemer , who was also mocked by a mob . Grant that the evil of the crowd will not fall upon me today . Help me in this hour when I make a parade of vanity forgetting Your example . And do not permit , Senor , a fault of mine to bring injury to those I care for . Amen . The words kept coming to Luis Bello kneeling in the silence . The most words he ever had . He touched the medal under his shirt . Santa Barbara , Blessed Saint whose name I guard well and do not speak because of thy purity and my evil . Santa Barbara , be with me on this thy day , and this the day of thy namesake , the Barbara dear to me . Santa Barbara who can stop storms and tremblings , help me today . Amen . Holy Mary , Mother of God , pray for our sins now in the hour of our  --  now in the hour of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right hand he touched his forehead , his breast , his left shoulder and his right . He asked it in the name of Father , of Son , of Holy Ghost , Amen . Crossing the thumb over the bent forefinger of his right hand to make the cross , he kissed it , and got up from the rail , taking his cape and montera . His shoes squeakedp225going toward the door ; he heard himself plainly , walking out to the bulls . He knew he was afraid . When he came out of the chapel he carefully pushed his montera down straight on his head and arranged his cape over his left shoulder , gathering it about his waist tightly and holding it there with his left hand . Then he decided he would light the cigar Marcelo Cadena had given him , to wet the dry taste in his mouth . Goyo borrowed a match and held a light for his matador . The toreros were all silent now , lined up in place for the procession . Luis stood at the head of the single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken the sobresaliente 's position , alone in the center , a pace behind the two matadors of cartel . Pepe stood even with Luis at the far right . With the addition of the local union toreros , the cuadrillas were evenly lined behind the matadors . The last five minutes before four o'clock were always the longest , always the hardest , for brave men or cowards regardless , who stood behind the cuadrilla gate in the shade under the stands , looking out into the sun , waiting . It always smelled the same there in the shade under the stands with the tobacco smoke and the horse manure and the nameless acridity where the sun never reached . It was the smell of the feeling of the bulls . Luis Bello smelled it , his mouth dry and his hands sweating . He could see the bulls waiting now in the dim chiqueros behind the red door , waiting for Luis Bello . His mind built their blackness and their size high and massive waiting for him there in the dark place . He could hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrible power leap into them with the jabbing bite from the barb of the **26;4187;TOOLONG Sunday the occupants of the court slept late , so Eric was able to sleep too . He had intended to take a trip to Coney Island , but it rained hard all day . He called up his mother and then Sylvia . Amelia was happy to hear from him , but she had written him all the trivial items of domestic news so there was not much to talk about . The conversation with Sylvia was brief too . She was in one of her weepy moods and talked about little but her pitiful loneliness , showingslight interest in his activities or state of mind . He dashed to the corner for lunch , returned with two bulky Sunday newspapers , and spent the rest of the day going methodically through the news sections , the drama sections , the book-review sections , the sports sections , the magazine sections , even the comic sections . Then , with time still on his hands , he toiled away at the crossword puzzles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had looked fearfully for a message telling of further delay ; and he often glanced at the telephone , expecting it to ring . But there was no message , the telephone did not ring , and he went to bed almost persuaded that tomorrow the long-awaited day would dawn at last . For Eric the delay had meant only more anxious waiting ; for Thompson it had created some serious problems . Under the strict rules of the Actors ' Equity Association , the trade union to which every professional actor had to belong , rehearsals were limited to four weeks . During this period the actors received a small weekly sum as rehearsal pay ; but on the twenty-ninth day they went on full salary regardless of whether public performances began or not . Every producer tried to keep the rehearsals down to four weeks to avoid the heavy expense of paying the actors when they were notp151playing to revenue-producing audiences . Since The Clouded Mirror was scheduled to open in New Haven on a Thursday , Thompson had set the beginning of rehearsals for exactly four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from California on Wednesday . Her expected arrival revived Thompson 's memories of Louise Henry , and it was not easy for him to bring himself to meet Emily at the airport . However , his presence was a courtesy she would expect and he had to go . Besides , he was influenced by the same hope of exorcisingLouise 's ghost that had steeled him to make the trip to Hollywood . On Tuesday night , however , his telephone rang and an unfamiliar voice said , " Hello , Mr. Thompson , this is Doctor Thwaite of BeverlyHills . I 'm Miss Emily Crandall 's physician and I 'm calling you at her request . " " Is anything wrong ? " asked Thompson , fearing the worst . " Well , Miss Crandall is suffering from a severe migraine headache . She 's subject to them , especially when she 's under nervous tension . It 's not serious , but she 's in considerable pain and in no condition to fly to New York . " " I 'm sorry to hear it , " said Thompson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to get here ? " " We 're doing everything possible for her , but sometimes these things are a little stubborn . I should think we could get her off by the end of the week . " " Not before then ? I 've got a pretty rigid rehearsal schedule here . In fact , we 're supposed to start on Thursday . " " Yes , " said the doctor , " Miss Crandall is well aware of that and asked me to tell you how disturbed she is . She wanted to talk to you herself , but the more quiet we can keep her , the sooner she 'll get over this . If you do n't mind my suggesting it , I think a reassuring telegram from you would have a good effect . She 's very worried about upsetting your plans . " " You do n't think she 'll get away before about Friday , is that it ? " persisted Thompson . " Friday or Saturday , I should say . An extra day 's rest here may make all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If YOU want to call me tomorrow , I may be able to be more definite , but I 'd count on Friday at the earliest if I were you . " Thompson took his telephone number , asked him to tell Emilyp152not to worry , and hung up . He was angry and alarmed . Everything had gone along so smoothly , and now , on the eve of rehearsals , this had to happen . Was Emily really ill or was this just a device to make him feel how dependent he was upon her ? The doctor sounded convincing enough , but then he might be a friend of hers ( or a lover , thought Thompson sardonically ) and in league with her ; or else , actress that she was , she might be shamming the symptoms of an ailment . Suppose her arrival was delayed further , or suppose she changed her mind and did not show up at all ? He had a binding contract and Equity was firm about disciplining its refractory membersno matter what their eminence , but an actress 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors often disagreed ; even if Equity did suspend her , it would not matter much to her , since it would mean only that she was barred from appearing on the stage and would in no way interfere with her screen career . He threshed about the room , lighting cigarettes and putting them out after a puff or two , helping himself liberally from the brandy bottle . There were three choices to be considered . He could begin on schedule with the other members of the company , working in Emily when she arrived ; he could cancel the New Haven performancesand spend the time rehearsing , thus giving himself four full weeks before opening in Boston on Monday night ; or he could stick to his plans and rehearse only three and a half weeks instead of four . Each had its disadvantages . Emily appeared in almost every scene , so that he would gain little by beginning without her ; besides , his resultant restiveness would communicate itself to the actors , who were always sensitive to a director 's moods . The cancellation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time but would disrupt his production program . Because the cost of hauling scenery into a New York theater , setting it up , hanging the lights , and then taking everything down and hauling it out again , was prohibitive , it was customary to have the dress rehearsal in the place where the first public performance was given  --  in this case New Haven . Also , the half-week there would enable him to straighten out any mechanical difficulties  --  an important consideration with a complicatedscenic production  --  and would give the actors a chance to feel easy in their parts by the time the play opened in Boston . A rough opening in New Haven was not a very serious matter ; in Boston it might mean the difference between a bad two weeks ' en/gagement and a very profitable one . So he decided reluctantly to adhere to his booking schedule and to get the play on in three and a half weeks . Emily Crandall , after her long absence from the stage , really needed the full four weeks , but he hoped that by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could make up the lost time . On Wednesday he told Winternitz to inform the newspaper drama editors of the postponement of rehearsals ( preferring an officialexplanation to the garbled versions that were bound to appear when the news leaked out ) and instructed McCarthy to notify the cast and Eric . He called Claire in the country and spent a half-hour trying to get her to view the situation with a calmness that he himselfdid not feel . Then he spoke to the dress designer , Louis-Jean Amiel , and told him that he would have to rearrange his schedule of costume fittings . Amiel ( always referred to as Louis-Jean ) was the internationally known couturier , who , over Murray Fineman 's agonized protests , had been sent to Hollywood , at great expense , to confer with Emily , so that the work on her costumes could be begunbefore her arrival in New York . Thompson was quite prepared for the hysterics with which Amiel received the news . On the verge of tears , the designer insisted that it would be absolutely impossible for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accustomed to dealing with feminine natures , succeeded , by flattery and cajolery , in getting him to accept the revised schedule . That evening , after calling Dr. Thwaite and learning that Emily was much better , he watched the performance of Give Them All My Love and went backstage at its conclusion to give the assembled actors notes on their shortcomings . Even Hugh Mollison was not spared the facetiously exaggerated commentary on the errors that had crept into the performance . The actors were grateful for this discipline , for it was impossible for them to maintain their perspective , and they relied upon the producer 's vigilance to keep them up to the mark . Mollison accepted Thompson 's invitation to go to a bar , but after one drink asked to be excused in order to catch a train to New Canaan , where he lived . Thompson guessed that Virginia Upton was waiting for him somewhere and did not try to detain him . He joined some acquaintances at a neighboring table and sat drinkingwith them until two o'clock . Next day Emily Crandall telephoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forgive her . She was feeling much ,  |p154much  better and had moved from her house in Mandeville Canyon to her bungalow at Malibu Beach in order to be thoroughly rested for her journey . She was definitely leaving on Saturday , was looking forward eagerly to rehearsals , and was tremendously excited about the whole thing . Thompson , in turn , showered her with complimentsand expressed tender solicitude for her well-being . All the while he was talking to her he kept wishing that he were working with someone less dull and wondering if he could succeed in concealingfrom her how much she bored him . Claire had come into town and was somewhat reassured by his report , but she could not feel wholly at ease until Emily was safely in New York . Counting upon a success , she had authorized alterationsand repairs in the Farow Theater that far exceeded her original plans , and she was getting anxious about her heavy investment . Thompson was outwardly sympathetic , but since she had not seen fit to give him an interest in the theater , he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He accepted her invitation to stay overnight in her apartment . Like Eric , he was beginning to find the days and nights unbearably long and preferred not to be alone . The Friday morning papers carried the news that Emily Crandall 's husband , Count Pedro Portagas  --  he was her third  --  had arrived in Las Vegas and filed a suit for divorce on the ground of mental cruelty . Thompson was highly pleased . This marital disagreement not only explained Emily 's nervous tension but assured him that she would be glad to put three thousand miles between herself and the buzz of Hollywood gossip . He was delighted , too , to escape the annoyance of having the Count , whom he regarded as a complete imbecile , hanging about during rehearsals . Evidently , he told himself , mental cruelty had nothing to do with the mind  --  or , at least , not in Nevada . In the afternoon he went to Claire 's country place , returning to New York Saturday night in order to get to the airport on time Sunday morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limousine , intending to take Emily to her Park Avenue hotel . But as they walked across the parking lot to the arrival gate Winternitz pointed out a long cream-colored car with California license plates , bearing only the letters EC . " Little Em'ly 's houseboat , " he said . " Sure enough ! " said Thompson . " She drove me around in it when I was out there . It cost nine thousand bucks . "  | " Well , EC come , EC go , " said Winternitz . " I 'll murder you ! " said Thompson , kicking his shin . Clustered about the arrival gate was a large group of photographers , newspaper reporters , friends of arriving passengers , and a sprinkling of the idly curious . Prominent among them was Emily 's chauffeur , dressed in a maroon livery that matched the upholstery of the car . He recognized Thompson and nodded condescendingly to him . " How do you always manage to get in with the big brass ? " asked Winternitz . He greeted several of the newspapermen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hi , Tommy , " said a dapper little man in a plaid sports jacket , putting an arm around Thompson 's shoulder . " Hello , Paul , " said Thompson not too cordially . Paul Kipner was one of the numerous New York representatives of Emily Crandall 's Hollywood agents , Screen Celebrities , Incorporated . The agency had almost succeeded in talking Emily out of signing with Thompson . They got ten per cent of all her earnings ; since her stage incomecould not possibly come up to her screen salary , they consideredit bad business for her to forsake Hollywood for Broadway . It had taken all of Thompson 's verbal ingenuity and personal charm to induce Emily to disregard the advice of the agency . " Well , I 'm glad we were able to wrangle it so that Emily could do this show for you , " said Kipner . " That 's what I like about your outfit , " said Thompson . " You 're in there pitching every minute . " Kipner , who was not too nimble-witted , glanced quickly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiated earnestness and sincerity . The plane was on time , to the minute . As it taxied to a stop and the ground crew wheeled the movable staircase into place , the waiting crowd swarmed out through the gate . The alighting passengersgreeted their friends and then , impressed by the battery of cameras , stood waiting for Emily to appear . She delayed her exit from the plane until all the other passengers were out , and emerged , followed by her maid , Nellie Duff , an angular , middle-aged Scotchwoman . As Emily came slowly down the steps Thompson went to greet her , but he was swept aside in the rush of reporters and photographers . The chauffeur relieved the maid of the small overnight bags , while Emily , carrying a great bunch of long-stemmed rosesp156and an alligator jewel-case with gold mountings , submitted graciously to the questioning of the reporters . They were particularly interested in getting the details of her marital difficulties and asked her , pointedly , whether either she or her husband had formed a new romantic attachment . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that at all . Bo-Bo and I are still the best of friends , and we expect to see a lot of each other . We just agreed to disagree , that 's all , " she added , rather pleased with herself for having hit upon this happy phrase . When the reporters had finished , the photographers went to work . First they had her inhale the scent of the flowers , with an expression of simulated ecstasy ; then the bouquet was handed over to the maid , and Emily was photographed warmly grasping the hand of the pilot , a war hero , who had been detained on the field for this purpose . Then she was directed to ascend the steps and pose in the doorway of the plane , waving and laughing . She submitted patiently to all this maneuvering , well aware of the importance of having herselfbrought constantly to the attention of the public . Thompson knew , too , that all this publicity was helpful to his production ; but it wounded his ego to be in the background while all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homage as a matter of right . He had a childish desire to do something that would make her look ridiculous . In the middle of her posing and posturing , Emily caught sight of him . " Hello , there , Tommy ! " she called . He smiled back and blew her a kiss . " Well , I finally made it , did n't I ? " said Emily , as she and Thompsonhugged each other . " And looking like somebody 's little sister . " He really was delighted to see how fresh and youthful she looked . She laughed with pleasure , and they posed together . Winternitz hovered about to make sure that Thompson 's unblemished cheek was presented to the camera . As soon as the photographer had finished , Emily was surrounded by a group that included Paul Kipner , a representative of World-Wide Films , the motion-picture companythat employed her , an assistant manager of the hotel to which she was going , an airport official who wanted to assure himself that she had had a comfortable trip , and several autograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly toward the gate . Thep157chauffeur had brought her car around and helped her into it . Her maid and Kipner followed . " Can I give you a lift back to town , Tommy ? " called Emily . " There 's plenty of room . " " Thanks , I 've got a car , " said Thompson . He had no wish to be part of her retinue . " I 'll see you in the morning then . And I can hardly wait ! " " The Farow , at twelve , " said Thompson . " Do n't worry ! I 'll be right on the dot . " She waved to him , the chauffeur tapped his horn lightly , the gaping spectators drew back , and the long , gleaming car rolled slowly away . " You 're slipping , Doc , " said Thompson . " Where 's the motorcycleescort ? " " I had it all fixed , " said Winternitz , " and then the Police Commissionerand I agreed to disagree . Confidentially , we 're both in love with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twentyone-gunsalute from the Staten Island ferryboats , and tonight every inmate of the Death House gets a turkey dinner . " " Well , she got here , goddam her . And you 've got to admit she looks marvelous . " Winternitz licked his lips . " She fills me with desire . In fact , I can think of nothing in the world that I want more , except some scrambled eggs and a good hot cup of coffee . " " All right , let 's go eat , " said Thompson . On Monday Eric arrived at the Farow Theater a half-hour before noon . He was surprised to see a crowd of untidy adolescents obstructingthe front of the theater . He had to push through them to enter the lobby , where three or four painters were at work.  | " Where do you think you 're goin ' , Charlie ? " asked one of the men as Eric picked his way among the scaffolds , ladders , and paint pots . " I want to get in to the rehearsal . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the stage door . " Eric went out on the sidewalk again and asked one of the waiting crowd where the stage door was . A dozen voices obligingly directedhim . He entered the iron gate and went down the littered alley to the wooden entrance door . In the little doorman 's lodge sat Patrick Gurney , the day man . He was a superannuated stagehand , whom everybody called Pop . Employed by Oscar Farow for many years , he had been rewarded with this sinecure when he became too old for active service . When Claire had organized the staff of the theater she had wanted to discharge not only him , but Harry Baumrucker , the master carpenter , Charles Ankrim , the master electrician , and Ira Whitestone , the master property man . Pop was nearly eighty , the others all past sixty , and she wanted to employ younger men . Under the regulations of the stagehands ' union ( known as Local Number One ) the " house crew , " once engaged , could not be dismisseduntil the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be tied down for a whole year to these elderly men . Thompson had protested not only for sentimental reasons  --  all of them had been employed at the Farow from the day it opened  --  but because the three " heads " were first-rate mechanics , skilled artisans who could deal with any backstage technical problem . He knew how importanta dependable and resourceful stage crew is to the smooth functioning of a production . For once , Anthony Weir , who had a much better grasp of the organizational side of production than did Claire , sided with him . So Claire yielded and re-engaged the veterans . They knew that they owed their jobs to Thompson , and he knew that he had won their unswerving loyalty and devotion . " Who you lookin ' for , sonny ? " said Pop in a thin voice as Eric stood uncertainly in the doorway . " I 'm looking for the rehearsal . " He had to repeat it twice before the old man understood him . " Twelve o'clock , " he said . Then , suspiciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm the author of the play . " " Oh , the author , " said Pop , not impressed . " Well , go right ahead in . There 's some of them there . " Eric followed the direction of the gnarled forefinger and found his way onto the stage . It was the first time he had ever set foot on  |p159the  stage of a professional theater and he trod carefully and with a certain awe . Except for the faint illumination from the skylights , the stage was lighted only by a large , glaring , naked electric lamp , suspended in a wire cage , just inside the curtain . The rest of the house was in darkness . On the stage were twenty-five or thirty plain wooden chairs , several long , backless benches , and a few batteredtables . The stage manager and his two assistants were arrangingsome fifteen of the chairs in a semi-ellipse facing the auditorium . " Oh , hello , Mr. Kenwood , " said McCarthy . " I guess you met Glad and Pete in the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two young assistants , Gladys Kaye , a dark , intense girl who wore a green eyeshade and had a bright yellow pencil stuck in her hair , and Peter Quirt , a tall , thin , pimply , inarticulate youth , whose technical experience in a Texas communitytheater had impressed Thompson . Quirt disappeared for a moment and returned with a large galvanized pail half-filled with sand , which he placed in front of the row of chairs to serve as a communal receiver for cigarette butts . Eric hovered in the background , not wanting to be in the way . The actors began to arrive , exchanged smiles and greetings with him , but paid no further attention to him . Their manner was quite different from what it had been in Thompson 's office . There they had been vivacious and self-assured ; here they moved about softly , with a hushed air of expectancy . When Thompson came in they all focused on him , hoping for a nod or a word . He , too , was tense and preoccupied . With him were Winternitz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robust , deep-voiced , businesslike girl . Thompson greeted Eric curtly , then frowned involuntarily as Irma Lanski came in . She shook hands with them and said to Thompson , " I hope you do n't mind my being here . " " No , of course not , " he lied . He did not like to have anyone , excepthis immediate associates , present at rehearsals and had not invitedher . However , as the author 's agent , she had a certain right to he there ; in any case , he did not want to insult her . " Shall we go and sit out front ? " she said to Eric , wanting to be as inconspicuous as possible . He followed her to a little wooden staircasewith a hand rail that bridged the orchestra pit and gave easy access from the stage to the auditorium . They seated themselves a few rows back , near another sand-filled pail . She took out one of her little cigars . Eric lit a cigarette.  |p160Claire  came down the steps and up the aisle . " Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious glance at Eric . " Hello , Claire darling . I do n't think you 've met the author . This is Mrs. Weir . " " How do you do , Mr. Kenwood ? " " How do you do ? " said Eric shyly . He remained seated , not from impoliteness but merely because he was too excited to think of these niceties . Claire thought him rude and sullen and took an instant dislike to him . " We 'll take good care of your carpet , " said Irina Lanski , noticing Claire 's anxious look at her cigar . " It is n't that , " said Claire . " It 's just that fire is one thing I 'm really terrified of . " The agent patted her hand . " Do n't worry , darling . I promise you we wo n't burn down your theater . " Claire forced a laugh and took a seat several rows behind them . Suddenly Eric saw Thompson stride quickly across the stage . The producer had seen Florence Fulham come in and he hurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage to walk out upon the stage . She had not entered the theater since Oscar Farow 's death ; this was truly an ordeal for her . It suddenly occurred to Thompson , too , how hard it must have been for her to elbow her way through the crowd on the sidewalk waiting for a newer star , of whose supportingcast she was a member . In fact , she had edged her way from the taxi to the gate , unknown and unnoticed , and she felt lonely and forgotten as she walked down the familiar alley and through the door from which she had so often emerged in triumph . Thompson kissed her warmly and , taking her by the hand , led her across the stage and introduced her to the other actors . Their deference and the affectionate greeting of Reginald Olmsted , with whom she had played years before , dissipated her sadness . She began to feel at home now , and among her own people , and she was deeply thankful to Thompson for his tact and graciousness . " Is that Florence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Irina Lanski , blowing her nose . " I feel that I would like to kneel and kiss Leroy Thompson 's hand . He understands that it is not easy to enter , for the first time , the graveyard where one 's youth is buried . " Thompson left Florence Fulham chatting easily with Olmsted and walked across the stage , looking at his watch . It was five minutes.  |p161to  twelve . Everyone kept glancing in the direction of the stage door , watching for Emily Crandall 's arrival . Thompson beckoned to Fineman . " Murray , " he said , " maybe you 'd better wait outside for Emily and get her through that pack of hyenas . If necessary , kill a couple of the little bastards . That 's an order . " " This 'll go on every day , " said Fineman . " I 'll see what I can do about having a cop around mornings and when we break . " As the minutes passed , Thompson grew increasingly impatient . He was a stickler for punctuality and his actors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to show her importance and to make a star 's " entrance , " or had some illness or accident detained her ? To conceal his restlessness and uneasiness he lit a cigarette and gave his secretary some perfunctory instructions . It was twenty minutes after twelve , and twenty-five . The actors ' conversationswere becoming more and more desultory . Many of them glanced furtively at their watches . Claire got up , walked around the hack of the auditorium , and took a seat on the other aisle . Nathan Winternitz went over to her . " It 's all my fault . I should have explained to her that there 's three hours ' difference between California and New York time . Artists do n't think of such things . " " She might at least have telephoned , " said Claire . " Well , there 's one thing I must say for Miss Crandall , " said Irma Lanski to Eric , " she knows how to build up suspense . I hope she can do it as effectively when there 's an audience in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table at the side of the stage where McCarthy was aimlessly shuffling scripts and parts . " You 'd better call her hotel , Mack . " " Okay , but I 'll take a look outside first to see if she 's on the way . " Everybody watched him as he walked briskly across the stage . Five minutes later he came back . All eyes followed him again as he walked toward Thompson . " Well ? " said Thompson . " She 's out there . Making with the autographs . Murray says she 'll be another couple minutes . " The import of what he was saying communicated itself to the actors . There was a general buzz , and they all concentrated their gaze toward the stage door . Another seven or eight minutes passed before Emily entered , accompanied by Fineman , Paul Kipner , and her maid , who carried two small bags . Emily was dressed in a pale pink slack suit and openp162sandals through which gleamed scarlet toenails . Her eyes were bright , and she seemed to be bursting with energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the younger actors automaticallyjoined in , but the more seasoned ones merely glanced at each other with raised eyebrows . " Tommy , " said Emily , rushing toward Thompson with outstretchedhand . " I 'm terribly sorry ! Do forgive me , wo n't you ? Just as I was leaving , California got me on the wire and I simply could n't get off . And then all those fans outside , of course . I ca n't tell you how awful I feel . " The truth was that , unable to get to sleep the night before , she had taken two powerful sleeping tablets . Her maid had been an hour getting her out of bed . Once up she was so sluggish she had to drink four cups of strong coffee before she was in condition to go to the theater . Then , just as she left the hotel she took a Benzedrine tablet , which was now just beginning to arouse her to a false vivacity . " It 's all right , " said Thompson , patting her hand with affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anything before we start ? " " Oh no , I 'm fine ! Let 's start as soon as you 're ready . " " All right , let 's go then , " said Thompson , with a malevolent look toward Paul Kipner , who was going down the steps to the auditorium . He had not been invited either , and had offered no apology for turning up . It would have relieved Thompson 's feelings to have asked him to leave or at least to have made some sarcastic reference to his presence , but he restrained himself . He placed Emily in the middle of the row of chairs and asked Florence Fulham and Reginald Olmsted to sit on either side of her , introducing them briefly . Emily acknowledged the introductions with bright-eyed animation . The other actors were quickly assigned to places consonant with their importance . Thompson stood facing them , waiting for everybody to settle down . " All right , quiet please , everybody ! " barked McCarthy . " All we 're going to do today is read the play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get acquainted with who 's who and what 's what . We 're doing this just for your information and mine , so do n't let me see any acting . In fact , anyone caught attempting to act will have to spend an hour listening to soap operas . " Everyone laughed . Thompson having accomplished his purpose of putting them a littlep163more at ease , came down to the auditorium and took a seat that was not near any of the other listeners . " All ready , boss ? " asked McCarthy , peering out into the darkness . " Yes , " said Thompson , taking a pull from a pint bottle of brandy he carried in his coat pocket . " Okay . Heads up , everybody , " said McCarthy . " Act One . Scene ; One . Greg enters , goes to phone , dials . " " Hello , is Mrs. Collins there ? " said the actor who was playing Greg , reading the first line of the play in a voice trembling with nervousness . And so the reading of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Olmsted read from complete scripts and had familiarizedthemselves with the play . Most of the other actors had not read it , and their parts , or " sides , " contained only the lines they had to speak and the " cues , " which consisted of the four or five final words of the speeches immediately preceding . Since these tags of speeches were often wholly unintelligible without the context , the actors had merely a general idea of the purport of their scenes and an even vaguer notion of the play as a whole . Hence this first reading was of great importance to them ; it acquainted them not only with the play , but with their relationship to it and to the other characters . They listened attentively , moving their heads from side to side , like spectatorsat a tennis match , as the dialogue shifted back and forth , watching at the same time for their cues , The reading proceeded haltingly . The actors were all nervous and self-conscious , sitting up there on display under the glaring light , knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associates out front were focused on them . They fumbled and stumbled over their lines , misreading and mispronouncing words , putting emphases in the wrong places , often missing cues . McCarthy and his assistants sat at a table to one side , following the text line by line . When there was a " business cue "  --  the ringing of a telephoneor doorbell or the firing of a shot  --  he would say , " Ding-aling-a-ling ! " or " Brrrr ! " or " Bang ! Bang ! " If an actor missed a cue he would call him sharply by name . There were many typing errors and omissions in the parts , and each time one of these occurred there was great confusion . The reading stopped entirely while McCarthy located the trouble and the actors made the necessary corrections . Whenever this happened , Thompson would rise andp164walk impatiently up and down the aisle , pausing to light a fresh cigarette or take another drink . Emily , overstimulated by the Benzedrine and aware that everyone on the stage and in the auditorium was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair , trying to control the trembling of her hands and lips . When her first cue came she plunged into her opening speech with far too much vehemence ; then , conscious of her own loudness , went to the other extreme , so that at times she was almost inaudible and the other actors had to strain to hear their cues . When the reading began Eric listened with great eagerness ; but as it proceeded he grew more and more depressed . He had expected the actors to illuminate his text and bring it vividly to life , but as they limped and struggled it sounded dull , flat , and devoid of meaning . He leaned far forward , trying to hear , squirming at every verbal mistake or false reading , and tearing at his cuticles until his fingers bled . When the first of the two acts came to a flat conclusion McCarthy said , " Curtain ! End of Act One ! " Thompson got up quickly . " All right , take five minutes . " " Five minutes ! " rasped McCarthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get a quick smoke . Emily 's maid hurried up to her with a glass of water and a small toilet case and helped her freshen her make-up . Thompson saw Claire coming toward him ; not wanting to hear what she had to say , he pretended not to see her and hurried to the lavatory . " Well , " said Irina Lanski to Eric , " how do you like your play ? " " It certainly does n't sound very good , " said Eric gloomily . " You are not opening tonight , you know . So do n't begin toworry just yet . " " Did n't you think it sounded bad ? " " Oh , an average first reading , I should say . I do think Tommy is going to have a little work with dear Miss Crandall . But after all , when you consider that she 's been shut up in those sound stages for ten years  --  ! " " But the other actors ! " said Eric . " That man who plays the father . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't until the opening night . If Reggie Olmsted 's performance were all we had to think about , we could already congratulate ourselves on a resounding success . " She rose as Claire came up the aisle . " Excuse me. "  |p165As  the two women went to the lounge Eric wandered over to the other aisle , where Winternitz , Fineman , and Kipner were talking together . They paid no attention to him , and he went back to his seat and lit another cigarette . The actors had begun to drift back . Presently Thompson came down the aisle , calling , " Whenever you 're ready , Mack ! " " Second act ! " shouted McCarthy . " And do n't let me see anybody drop a cigarette butt on the stage , either now or as long as we 're in this theater . There 's a bucket there , so please make use of it . " The actors slipped back into their places , and the reading of the second act began . Like the first , it dragged along confusedly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappilyin his seat . It was torture to listen , and he was glad when it was over . " We 'll take a half-hour , " said Thompson the moment the reading ended , " and then we 'll read it again . " " Everybody back in half an hour , " bellowed McCarthy . The actors dispersed , most of them leaving the theater for coffee and something to eat . Emily sat motionless . The effect of the Benzedrinewas wearing off and she was beginning to wilt . Seeing that she needed reassurance , Thompson started for the stage . As he went down the aisle Kipner hurried after him and seized him by the arm . " That Crandall is going to turn in a great performance , Tommy , " he said in an intense whisper . " You do n't have to sell her to me , " said Thompson . " You 've got my signature to a binding contract . " Kipner looked offended , then laughed . " You 're always there with the old razzamadazz , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thompson came over to her . " Well , how do you feel ? " he said , smiling . " Not so good . I sounded awful , did n't I ? " " If you 'd been any better , I 'd be worried . All we were doing it for was to get everybody acquainted and straighten out the bugs in the script . " Kipner came up and put an arm around Emily . " You were terrific ! You 're going to be a knockout in this part ! " " Well , I wish I thought so , " said Emily . " What are you talking about ? You tell her , Tommy . " " Do n't you want something to eat ? " asked Thompson , ignoring Kipner.  | " I 'd love a cup of coffee . Could somebody  --  " " I 'll send my secretary . Kate ! " he called . " Right here , " said Katherine Swayne , bustling up . " Just coffee , Miss Crandall ? " " Yes . Just black coffee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the secretary , already on her way . " Is there some place I could relax for just a minute ? " said Emily in a small , pathetic voice . " Yes , sure , " said Thompson . " We 're got the dressing-room all fixed up for you . Did n't they tell you ? Pete ! " " Yes , sir ! " said Peter Quirt , hurrying over . " Show Miss Crandall where the dressing-room is . " " Right this way , Miss Crandall , " said Peter . " Thank you very much , " said Emily with a wan smile . She and her maid followed Peter to the star dressing-room , which had been especially redecorated and refurnished for her . Claire had balked a little at the expense , but Thompson had seen Emily 's luxurious accommodationsin the Hollywood studio and wanted to make her relatively modest theater quarters as attractive as possible . As Emily went to the dressing-room she passed Florence Fulham , who was making a call from the coin-box in the corridor . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter the celebrated suite that the older woman had occupied so often and so long . The use of a dressing-room during rehearsals was a privilege accorded only to stars . Now , like the other actors , Florence would be sitting out the long hours on the uncomfortable wooden chairs , the sole furniture of the stage . Eric invited Irina Lanski to have a drink with him , and they walked up the alley together . The unruly crowd of youngsters still clustered about the gate and made egress almost impossible . " Hey , mister ! " said a raucous , unkempt girl , " when is Emily coming out ? " " Not for a few hours , " said Eric , shoving his way through the crowd , followed by Irina Lanski . Everyone who had come out had given the same answer , but Emily 's admirers regarded it as a ruse to get rid of them , and they stolidly stood their ground . " Filthy little beasts ! " said the agent as she and Eric crossed the street to O'Leary 's bar-restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents of the one to follow , then God help American civilization ! "  | " Maybe it 's not their fault , " said Eric . " Maybe they 're just productsof an educational system that fixes our attention on success rather than on what goes on inside of us . " Several of the booths in the bar were occupied by members of the cast , who waved and smiled at Eric . He and Irina Lanski found an empty booth ; she ordered a double brandy and soda and he a sandwich and a glass of beer . " This American system of play production always makes me want to shriek and tear my hair , " she said . " I have been nearly thirty years in America and have heard nothing but talk about efficiency and what is called , I believe , know-how , but I have never got used to the miracles of inefficiency and don't-know-how that I see performed in the American theater . In Europe a brilliant director like Leroy Thompson would be the regisseur of an established state or municipal theater . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained actors and a permanent staff of technicians , all accustomed to working together in the closest cooperation . Your play would have been read and discussed for many weeks , perhaps many months , and the actors would come to the first rehearsal thoroughly familiar with every line of the text and already saturated with the parts they are to play . The theater would be equipped with a complete and flexible machinery for staging and lighting a play , including cycloramas , revolving stages , projection machines , and I do n't know what all . And it would have a storehouse filled with scenery , properties , and costumes , suitable for almost any conceivableplay , whether classical or modern . But what happens here ? On the stage , at the first rehearsal , sits a group of actors , assembled God knows how and from where , who have never seen each other before and who have not even read the play in which they are to perform . And in exactly four weeks , to the very day , they must he prepared to give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know just how finished , go and see nine-tenths of the exhibitions in our Broadway theaters . And so with the productions . Everything is started from the beginning  --  scenery , costumes , lightingequipment  --  as though no one had ever done a play before ; and with an appalling waste of time , energy , and money . And when the play closes , whether it runs a day or a year , everything finishes with it . The actors are disbanded , the scenery is burned , the costumesare sold to the ragman . And with the next play the whole process is repeated all over again . Nothing is learned , nothing isp168saved , there is no permanence , no continuity , no program , no pattern , no objective , no ideal . It is all waste , waste , waste  --  like cutting down the forests , like exhausting the rich soil , like allowing the great flood waters to go unrestrained and the garbage pails to overflow with the sustenance of a starving world . Grown-up children in a gigantic nursery , smashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich , and tomorrow the man from the United Parcel Service will bring a new and shinier lot . But not of such children as these , my dear young friend , is the kingdom of heaven . " Eric listened with rapt attention , forgetting for the moment his concern about his play . His knowledge of the theater was almost entirely literary . Everything she said about the apparatus of play production was new and revealing to him . But what interested him more was that she shared his belief in the importance of spiritual values . His mother had that belief too , and he tried to emulate her example of expressing it in terms of daily living . His creative nature , however , demanded a philosophical and artistic expression as well , and Irma Lanski was almost the first person he had ever known who seemed to feel the same deep need . As he listened to her he had a warm and comforting feeling of kinship . " Well , " she said as the actors began to file out , " I think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will forgive me for my soap-box oration . It is a lucky thing that the pulpit of my church is not open to women , for I would have bored the devout to the point of heresy . " " I wish I could tell you how much it 's meant to me , " said Eric . " I have n't met many people who have your point of view . Will you talk to me again sometime ? " She smiled . " If you can put up with a garrulous old maiden aunt  --  ! " She did not go back to the theater with him . He pushed his way alone through the still-vigilant crowd . Fineman , Winternitz , and Kipner did not come back either , and Claire was the sole occupant of the auditorium . Eric wanted to sit beside her and become better acquainted , but her cold nod discouraged him , and he sat by himself , several rows away . When all the actors except Emily had assembled , Thompson sent McCarthy to ask if she was ready . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interval she had removed her **25;4215;TOOLONG underwear and her maid had given her an alcohol rub-down and had massaged the muscles of her neck . She put on fresh clothing that Nellie had brought along , drank a pint of coffee , took another Benzedrine tablet . Thus artificially stimulated , she was able to return to the stage , looking fresh and alert . To Eric 's relief the second reading sounded very different . The actors had got over their initial strangeness and nervousness . Their parts were in order , they understood their relationship to one anotherand to the play , and they began to put some meaning into their lines . Even Emily was far more at ease and read with clarity and good phrasing . " All right , children , " said Thompson when the reading came to a close , " and thank you . " Then by way of encouragement , " That was n't too bad , and I think we 'll go on for another day or two anyhow . " He waited for the inevitable laugh . " Tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right from the beginning . " " Everybody at twelve tomorrow , " echoed McCarthy . Thompson climbed up on the stage , said a few complimentary words to the principal actors , and went over to Emily . " Darling , that sounded like a little bit of all right . " " I only hope I 'll be able to do it , " she said . " I 'm not worried about that , so why should you be ? " Eric approached rather shyly . He had asked McCarthy to introducedhim to Reginald Olmsted and Florence Fulham , and they had been most friendly . Now he wanted to meet Emily . " Excuse me , Mr. Thompson , " he said , " but I have n't met Miss Crandall . " " Oh , I 'm sorry ! You certainly are two people who should get together . Emily , meet Mr. Kenwood , the author of this horse opera . " " How do you do , Mr. Kenwood ? " said Emily with a mechanical smile , barely touching his outstretched hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far below a director , cameraman , or costume designer , and only slightly above an expert make-up artist . " I 've just been telling Emily how good she 's going to be in this part , " said Thompson in an effort to prod Eric into the required compliments . " Yes , " said Eric , " I was disappointed in the first reading , but I thought the second one was much better . " This hardly came up to what was expected of him . Emily turned  |p170to  Thompson as though she had not heard . " Do you think someone could see if my car is here , Tommy ? " Thompson dispatched Peter Quirt on this errand and went on engaging Emily in flattering small talk . Eric , feeling completely out of it , said , " Well , I think I 'll go along . Good night . " " Good night , " said Emily with a frigid little smile . Thompson was more cordial . " See you tomorrow , Eric . And do n't get too drunk tonight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eric laughed and left the theater . Only two or three eager adolescentswere at the gate , but when he reached the sidewalk he discovered the reason . The waiting throng , together with a large numberof adult passers-by , had gathered about Emily 's limousine . The chauffeur , accustomed to such attention , sat erect at the wheel , impassiveexcept for an occasional frown and turn of the head when some exploratory finger ventured to touch the car . Impressed by this magnificent chariot , the like of which he had never seen , Eric crossed the street and joined a staring group that preferred a full view of the car 's unobstructed side . He listened with interest to the comments , which ranged from the reverential to the ribald . Suddenlyone of the lookouts , posted at the gate , shouted , " Here she comes ! " Instantly the car was abandoned and the mob swarmed to the gate to greet its owner . Emily appeared , flanked by McCarthy and Peter , and followed by her maid . From the waiting crowd arose a deafening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upraised arms flourished autograph albums and fountain pens . Eric looked on for a few moments , in utter amazement , then walked back to his hotel , tired but happy . His talk with Irina Lanski , his first real contact with the world of the theater , and the encouraging second reading of the play combined to give him a feeling of exhilaration and eager anticipation . After a quick supper , he wrote long descriptions of the day 's events to his mother and to Sylvia . Thompson did not share Eric 's optimism , and at dinner he expressed his misgivings to Claire . " I 'm really worried about that gal . " " I thought she read quite well the second time , " said Claire . He shook his head dubiously . " She 's hopped up and jittery . I do n't know if she 'll be able to make the grade or not . " " You 're just tired . " " Maybe that 's it . Well , " he said , beckoning to the waiter , " let 's see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things went better . Murray Fineman had visited the local precinct . At his request , reinforced by the persuasiveness of a twenty-dollar bill , a patrolman had been assigned to special duty at the Farow Theater . When Eric arrived shortly before noon the officer was keeping loiterers on the move . On the stage the chairs had been pushed back , and Eric was puzzled to see the floor crisscrossed with heavy lines in varicolored chalks . Peter Quirt explained that each color indicated the outlines of one of the settings , with the gaps denoting doors and windows . The stage managers were placing chairs , tables , and benches to represent the furnishings of the first scene , for one of the absurdities of the production system was that none of the actual scenery or properties could be used during rehearsals without payment of full salaries to carpenters , property men , and electricians . Since no producerwas willing to incur this expense , the actors had to put up with kitchen chairs , rickety tables , and imaginary or incongruous substitute props all during rehearsals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose harassing glare they tried to protect themselves by means of dark glasses , eyeshades or turned down hat brims . If the play called for music or sound effects , these had to be simulated by the stage managers or merely imagined , and the delicate task of coordinating them with the action of the play had to be deferred , too , until the dress rehearsal . This insufficiency of preparation often resulted in a stumbling first-night performance that could well jeopardize the play 's chances of success . The audienceand the critics judged the performance only by what they saw and could not be expected to take into account the obstacles that the actors had to overcome.  |p172Accom|panied  by her . maid , Emily arrived a few minutes before twelve . Thompson was relieved to see her on time and bade her a smiling good morning , at the same time appraising her physical and mental state . She seemed vivacious and self-possessed , but he could see that it was all artificial . She spoke graciously to the principal actors and nodded with the proper degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is everybody here now ? " Thompson asked Gladys Kaye , one of whose duties it was to keep the attendance record . " Yes , sir , all here . " " Let 's get started then . " " Stand by for Act One , Scene One , " barked McCarthy . As Thompson turned he almost collided with Eric , who was teeteringuncertainly , not knowing quite where to go . " I think you 'll be more comfortable out front , " said Thompson a little sharply . He accepted an author 's right to attend rehearsals but preferred not to be constantly aware of his presence . Script in hand , Eric descended to the auditorium and took a seat in the second row , but his weak eyes could not endure the glare of the work light , and he soon moved back out of its range . Thompson , also holding a script , took the center of the stage . His hat was pulled down over his eyes and the brandy bottle protruded from his coat pocket . He briefly described the setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors and windows , and explainingwhich of the chairs and tables represented a sofa , an armchair , a desk , a bookcase , a fireplace fender . Eric listened attentively . In his text he had described the settings only in the sketchiest and most general terms ; he had not even visualizedthem very clearly . He was interested primarily in his characters , his ideas , and the quality of his writing . He had little feeling for decoration and little understanding of the practical requirements of stage production . To a director and , above all , to actors these were matters of paramount importance . An actor 's movements were necessarilydetermined by the shape and dimensions of the settings , the situation of the means of ingress and egress , and the nature , size , and position of the furniture . The imperfect " sight lines " and acoustics of the average theater and the narrowly limited playing area ( particularly in a multi-scened play like Eric 's , where the settings had to be small ) required the planning of every move and gesture in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dra/matic effectiveness of the performance by creating the illusion of unstudied grace and ease . Thompson 's understanding of these problems and his ability to solve them sensitively , subtly , and at times brilliantly , made actors eager to work under his direction , for they knew that he helped them get the most out of their parts and make the best use of their talents . Good directors were as rare as good playwrights and good actors . Many a play and many a performance were ruined by directorial ineptitude . Unlike lesser directors , who approached rehearsals with no clearly conceived over-all pattern and groped their way along by a process of improvisation and trial and error , which often produced a weak and fumbling result , Thompson spent weeks in preparatory work , studying and analyzing every scene and every speech and evolving a firm and comprehensive design , so that he came in knowing exactly what effect he wanted to create and the precise and detailed means of achieving it . During the first days of rehearsal he seldom left the stage . Pacing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **25;4242;TOOLONG , moving them about  --  sometimes by actual physical manipulation  --  like men on a chessboard , each move a step forward in a carefully planned campaign that led to a predetermined end . As the rehearsal of the first scene progressed line by line , Eric , who was watching closely , was puzzled and a little worried . He was unable to grasp the significance of Thompson 's preoccupation with minute details of physical movement . His interest was in the meaning of his play and the dramatic conflict of his characters . He could not see what difference it made whether an actor turned this way or that , whether he rose or sat on this line or another , and at what particular moment he lighted a cigarette or put it out . A dozen times he was impelled to come forward and call Thompson 's attention to a misreading or a mistake , but he could not summon the courage to make himself so conspicuous . Knowing nothing about acting , he did not understand the necessity of coordinating words and action  --  he had studied Hamlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an essay on the art of acting  --  and he did not realize that it was hard for an actor to read a line effectively unless he knew what his body was doing when he read it . Occasionally , when it was necessary for the effectuation of his scheme of movement , Thompson would transpose a line , delete an impeding word or phrase , give one actor an interjection to break orp174punctuate another 's overlong speech . Each time he would turn his head and say to the invisible Eric , " If the author does n't mind , " or " If that 's okay with you , Eric , " for Eric had the contractual right to disapprove any textual change . Though Eric saw no reason for these minor alterations , he saw no reason either for objecting , so he gave his monosyllabic assent , for which Thompson hardly waited . At one point , when Thompson said to one of the younger actors , " No , do n't sit on that speech ! " and the actor replied , " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Thompson said , " One of the first rules of acting is never to pay any attention to an author 's stage directions . " To appease Eric he added , " I hope the author is n't in the theater . " The actors laughed , and Eric , who cared nothing about his stage directions , said , " No , he 's not . " After spending over two hours in laying out the stage business of the first scene , Thompson called a half-hour recess . The actors dispersedas usual for some refreshment ; Emily retired to her dressingroom . She had conducted herself very well . Not yet called upon for any interpretation of her part , she had carried out Thompson 's mechanical instructions in a workmanlike manner , for she used her body well and moved freely and easily . Eric hurried up to Thompson just as the latter was leaving the stage . " Oh , Tommy , " he said , finding the courage to address the director by his familiar name , " I just wanted to tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think Miss Crandall is reading the lines the way  --  " Thompson interrupted sharply . " She 's not wearing the right shoes either . She 'll read the lines when the curtain goes up . " With that he strode off . Rebuffed and wishing he had kept quiet , Eric walked across the street to the bar . Peter Quirt , Gladys Kaye , and Lily Prengle , a pale , slender girl , who was playing the part for which Suzanne Merchanthad unsuccessfully applied , were sitting in one of the booths . They invited Eric to join them . He accepted gladly , and their warmth and friendliness made him forget the sting of Thompson 's rebuke . He had been in New York for ten days now , and this was almost his first social contact . These were young people like himself , eager , ambitious , and taking their first uncertain steps in a professional world that fascinated and frightened them . When it was time to go he offeredto pay the check , but was relieved when the others insisted upon paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her brief professional experience , explained that it was the custom among ac/tors , who frequently dined together in the course of production , to go Dutch . " And that goes for authors too , " she added . Eric returned to his seat in the theater as Thompson began to break in the second scene . Presently Claire , with a curt nod , took a seat across the aisle . Feeling that they should become better acquainted , Eric went over to her . " Good afternoon , Mrs. Weir , " he said . " How do you do , " said Claire with a disapproving glance at his cigarette . " Well , I 'm glad we 're really getting started , " said Eric , not knowingquite what to say . " I think we 're disturbing Tommy , " she said as Thompson glanced over his shoulder . " Yes , I guess we are , " said Eric , moving back to his seat . " Do be careful with that cigarette , wo n't you ? " " Yes , I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself with this chic woman of the world , who obviously found him gauche and uninteresting . The rehearsal progressed smoothly . By the end of the afternoon almost half of the first act had been blocked out . Thompson complimentedEmily upon her aptitude , and she told him what a pleasure it was to be working again in the theater after so many years ' absence . He went to Claire 's apartment , aching with weariness after his six hours ' concentrated work but pleased with the way things were going and considerably reassured about Emily . Claire waited on him in a self-effacing and companionable way , and he felt comfortable and even a little tender . " I do n't think much of that author of yours , " she said . " He looks and acts like a hillbilly . " " He 's a little wet behind the ears , but he 'll be all right once he gets the cornsilk out of his hair . " " Do you think he really wrote the play ? He does n't look to me like anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't write the letters of Lord Chesterfield , if that 's what you mean . But he 's got something , do n't kid yourself . " " Nothing that would be of any interest to me . I definitely do n't like him . " " Well , that gives me one less rival to worry about , " said Thompson , kissing her . On Wednesday morning everybody at the theater was talking about the weather . It was the season of equinoctial storms , and the news/papers carried alarming stories of a Caribbean hurricane that had caused great damage in Florida and was sweeping up the Atlantic coast . The Weather Bureau experts were uncertain whether it would spend its velocity at sea or twist its way through the North Atlantic states . The day was sultry and oppressive , and everyone was uncomfortableand rather ill at case . At twelve-fifteen , Emily had not appeared . Thompson decided to do what he could without her . He knew that she had an early appointment for a fitting at Louis-Jean 's and assumed that the exacting and temperamental designer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked , as best he could , with the other actors , reviewingwhat he had done the day before and making a minor adjustment here or there . At one o'clock he instructed McCarthy to telephone Louis-Jean 's . The stage manager returned with the information that Emily was on her way to the theater . A few minutes later she arrived , looking pale and tired . " I 'm awfully sorry , Tommy , " she said petulantly , " but that damned little swish would n't let me get away . " " It 's all right , darling , " said Thompson soothingly . " Are you ready to begin ? " " Well , I 'd like a few minutes to freshen up , " she said crossly . " I 've been on my feet since nine-thirty and I 'm just about pooped . " Without waiting for his assent she walked off to her dressing-room . The other actors exchanged glances at this not unexpected display of temperament . Thompson , annoyed , said sharply , " All right , let 's go right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . " Okay , I 'm ready now , " she said curtly , without apology for the further delay . Thompson now took up the play at the point he had left off the day before . Though he knew exactly what he wanted to do , it was hard to get it done . Emily was sullen and uncooperative , had to be told everything three times , and quibbled endlessly about every little point . Thompson , fuming inwardly , managed remarkably well to keep his patience ; seeing , at the end of an hour , that he was making little progress , he called the customary recess somewhat earlier than usual . The break was welcome ; the tension was beginning to get on everybody 's nerves . During the interval Thompson debated with himself the advisability of putting on a temperamental act of his own but decided against  |p177it  . Emily could make things very hard for him if she wanted to , and a show of authority at this point might provoke her to unmanageable insubordination . If he gave her her head for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of control , her ego would probably be sufficiently gratified and she would be more amenable . For his own emotional satisfaction he would have liked to slap her face or humiliateher in some way before the whole company , but he was far too shrewd and self-disciplined to indulge in any such act of folly . Later on , a carefully calculated outburst might be useful ; for the time beingit would be better to maintain an unruffled exterior and behave as though nothing were wrong . So , having fortified himself by liberalrecourse to the brandy bottle , he went back to the auditorium . Feeling that not much was to be gained by breaking new ground , he decided to spend the rest of the afternoon in going over what had already been worked out . It was not time wasted , for only by constantrepetition could the actors acquire the necessary smoothness . He told the company to begin with the opening of the play and sat out in the first row in order to see the action in perspective . For a time the rehearsal proceeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were expected to do , and if they did make a slip McCarthy , who had written every minute detail of stage business into his script , corrected them . Occasionally Thompson would stop them to refine a point or make some slight change . All this was in accordance with the ordinary rehearsal routine . Suddenly , however , while Florence Fulham was in the middle of a long speech , Emily sprang to her feet . " I 'm sorry , " she said to Florence ; then , turning toward Thompson , " Tommy , I just do n't feel comfortable in this scene . " Thompson took his feet off the rail of the orchestra pit and leaned forward . " What bothers you about it ? " He knew very well what bothered her and was not unprepared for this moment , but he wanted a little time to figure out how to handle it . The scene was an intimate one in which the heroine 's mother pleads with her to give up her married lover . She had several long , emotional speeches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was one of the few scenes that Florence had and almost the only one that gave her a chance to show her ability . In order to display Florence to the fullest advantage and enable her to make the most of the scene , Thompson had placed her on a sofa , in the centerp178of the stage , with Emily on a low stool , nearer the footlights , so that Florence , in speaking to her , would also be speaking directly to the audience , her whole face visible from every seat in the house . What irked Emily was this high-lighting of Florence . If Emily were playing a similar scene in a motion picture , the camera focus would be almost entirely on her , with only enough reference to the mother to keep her in the scene . During most of the long speeches the mother would merely be heard on the sound track , while the audience was confronted with mammoth close-ups of Emily 's face , stained with great glycerine tears . Yet here she was , huddled in a corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no lines to speak , while a member of her supporting company monopolized the attention of the audience . " Well , " she said in answer to Thompson 's question , " it 's just that I do n't feel right , playing it this way . It seems very unnatural for her just to sit and sit like this . " The other actors , seated at the back of the stage , had been studyingtheir parts or talking in whispers , paying little attention to the routine repetition of scenes ; now they were all eyes and ears , for they fully understood the significance of what was going on and awaited the outcome with deep interest . For Florence Fulham it was a tense moment and a vital one , but she gave no indication of it . She put her script on her knees and sat with folded hands as though she were merely waiting politely for the director and the star to finish their discussion . Only Eric was uninterested and impatient . The implicationsof Emily 's objection were entirely lost upon him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical details and get on with the interpretation of the play . " It does n't hit me that way , " said Thompson , feeling his way carefully . " She respects her mother and is moved by what she says . At the same time she 's got this crazy infatuation for Wes , and she does n't want to give him up . So she sits there , tense , nervy , taking it all in and trying to make up her mind . " " Yes , trying to make up her mind . That 's just it ! When I 've got a problem and am trying to make up my mind , I have to get up and move around . I do n't huddle up on a footstool and just sit still . " " Well , it 's easy enough to get you moving around . But I deliberatelydid n't , because for my dough it 's twice as effective this way . That 's why I 've got you on a low stool , where you look cramped and hunched up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're talking about  --  and economically , without a lot of strutting and stamping around . It looks fine from out here . " " It does n't feel fine , " retorted Emily sharply . " Of course , I can do it that way technically if that 's how you want it . But I think there should be some emotion in this scene . And I ca n't get any emotion into it if I do n't feel right in it . My God , she 's a sexy girl who 's being asked to give up the man she 's crazy about . If you want me to play it like a department-store dummy , why , that 's up to you . But do n't expect me to make it look like anything . " The actors listened in shocked amazement . None of them would have dared to speak to Thompson in such a manner and they wondered what he would do . But he remained impassive , giving no sign that anything out of the ordinary had happened . " Well , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't feel , " he said . " Let 's run the scene from the beginning , and you play it the way you feel it and let me see how it looks . All right , Flossie , if you do n't mind . " " Certainly not , " said Florence , rising . " Shall I take it from my entrance ? " " No , no , just from your first long speech . Give her the cue , Emily , will you ? " " Oh , just a moment , please . " Emily turned and called to her maid . " Nellie , bring me my cigarettes and lighter . " Thompson swore inaudibly as the maid hurriedly complied . This was going to be even worse than he had expected . " All ready ? " said Emily to Florence . " Whenever you are , Miss Crandall , " said Florence serenely . Emily gave the required cue , and Florence launched into the first of her long speeches . Suddenly Emily sprang to her feet and began pacing back and forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hardly believe what he saw . If the scene were played that way , not only would Florence be obscured from the audience ( luring half of her speech , but attention would be entirely upon Emily , since the eyes of a spectator always follow a moving object . In the middle of her speech Florence stopped and put down her script . Emily turned and looked at her . " I 'm sorry , " she said , with badly simulated innocence , " is that my cue ? " " No , " said McCarthy . " Your cue is as they were in the past . ' " " That 's what I thought ! " " Am I to go on ? " said Florence to Thompson.  |p180He  gave her an appealing look . " Please . This is just to see how it looks . Or wait , maybe we 'd better start it again . Back where you 're seated , Emily , please . " " Why , of course ! " said Emily sweetly . " And this time try walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm afraid you 'll mask Miss Fulham if you cross her like that . " " Oh , is that what the trouble was ? " She turned to Florence with an apologetic laugh . " I 'm terribly sorry , dear . I was n't even thinking of where I was going . I just had the impulse to go and I followed it . But if walking upstage makes it easier for you , why I do n't mind a hit . " Florence did not move a muscle . " However the director wants it . " " Try it upstage , Emily , " said Thompson . As Emily walked toward the stool there was an audible buzz from the actors who were seated at the back of the stage . Suddenly Emily swung around sharply . " Christ ! " she said , stamping her foot , " does there have to be all that talk ? " She turned to Thompson . " Gab , gab , gab ! Chatter , chatter , chatter ! How the hell is anybody supposed to concentrate ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They can say what they like about Hollywood , " said Emily , resumingher seat , " but at least people have the decency to keep quiet when there 's a rehearsal going on . Are you ready ? " she said to Florence . " Whenever you are , Miss Crandall . " They began again . This time Emily paced upstage and down again . It was not quite as bad as before , but it still had the effect of divertingattention from Florence to her . When her turn to speak came , Emily moved over , almost directly behind Florence , so that Florence , in order to address her , would have to turn her face almost entirely away from the audience . Florence glanced out at Thompson . He gave no sign , and she went stolidly on with her speech . In the middle of it Emily walked away from her and , facing front , flashed her lighter and lit a cigarette . Thompson had been waiting for this from the momentEmily asked for the cigarettes . He knew , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the novices , that a flash of fire on the stage will blot out the noblest words that were ever written . " Excuse me , Flossie , " he said . Florence stopped , instantly , and he addressed Emily . " Are you just having a smoke , darling , or are you planning to do it that way ? "  | " Well , I thought I would . I always smoke when I 'm nervous and worried and I thought she might too . And with another long speech coming up , it gives me something to do . Anything wrong with it ? " " Well , if you 're going to use the cigarette , I 'd rather you lighted it on one of your own speeches . " Emily gave another apologetic laugh . " Why , of course ! Goodness , I can light it anywhere you say . I 'm just trying to give you the generaleffect of how I feel the scene . If there 's anything that does n't look right , why , just tell me . Shall we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late and I want to do Scene Three before we break . Let me think about this scene and see what I can work out . " There was a brief pause while McCarthy , blueprint in hand , instructedhis assistants to arrange the chairs and tables for the next scene . Then Thompson took over , and the rehearsal period proceeded without further incident . Emily tried to behave as though nothing had happened and obediently followed Thompson 's directions . She was painfully conscious of the silent hostility of her fellow-players , and when the company was dismissed she went swiftly to her dressingroomwithout a word to anyone . As Thompson went over to talk to McCarthy he saw Florence Fulham , seated on a bench , obviously waiting to talk to him . He knew there was trouble ahead , and as he gave McCarthy his instructions he tried to think of the best way to smooth things over . When he had finished with the stage manager Florence came toward him . " Could I talk to you for a minute , Tommy ? " " Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding the situation , quickly gathered up his belongings and bade them a brisk good night . Thompson patted Florence 's hand . " I 'm sorry for what happened , Flossie . " " Tommy , I hope you wo n't think I 'm being difficult  --  " She was on the verge of tears and had trouble keeping her voice under control . " I never met anyone less difficult in my life , " he said . " It 's sweet of you to say so . But I 'm going to ask a great favor of you . I want you to let me turn in my part , please . It 's only the third day of rehearsals and you told me yourself that you had several other people in mind . I know I have a run-of-the-play contract , but I 'm hoping you wo n't hold me to it . " " To hell with the contract ! But I want you in that part . I 'd neverp182be satisfied with anybody else , now that I 've heard you read it . Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Her tears were beginning to flow . " I 'm terriblysorry to have to do this . I like the part . You told me it was small , and I said I did n't mind and I do n't . And I love working with you . But it 's eight years since I 've been on the stage and this is important to me . What 's the good of my doing it if I ca n't even play the one good scene I have ? Oh , damn it ! I was n't going to cry ! " " You 'll play the scene and they 'll rave about you . Do n't let yourselfbe thrown by little Missy 's shenanigans . You do n't think for one minute I 'm going to let her get away with it , do you ? I just thought I 'd give her a chance to get that Hollywood stuff out of her system . That 's why I did n't crack down on her . " She shook her head . " No , I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big star and a big name and big box-office and you 've got to think of that . The success of your play depends on her , not on me . So let me go , and let her have the scene and everybody will be happy . " " I wo n't be happy , " he said . " Do n't forget that I 'm a big shot too in my own small way . And when I ope my mouth , let no dog bark  --  and no little bitch either . When we get to doing this rodeo , it 's going to be done the way I want it , and any little sweetheart of the silver screen who does n't like it can go back to wherever the hell she came from . " He put his arm around her . " Look , darling , I 'm going to ask you to do something for me  --  " " No , do n't try to persuade me . " " Wait till you hear what I 've got to say . All I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week . No , listen ! If you come to me one week from today and still want to be released , I promise you I wo n't even argue about it . " " It will never work out , " she said . He pleaded and begged and at last she reluctantly gave in . He thanked her and kissed her , and she left the theater , feeling considerably reassured . Thompson thought he should say a few words to Emily , but the door of the dressingroomwas closed ; it was obvious that she was simply waiting for everybody to leave , so he decided not to go in . " Everything going along all right , Mr. Thompson ? " said Pop as he passed the doorman 's lodge . He smiled and waved his hand . " Could n't be worse , Pop ! " he said , secure in his knowledge of the old man 's deafness.  |p183He  said nothing to Claire about his difficulties , knowing she would only get upset without contributing anything to their solution . After dinner they went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece , atrociously acted and certain to be a failure . But its very ineptitudes amused him and kept his mind off his troubles . After the play they went to Pinelli 's and had supper at a large table with half a dozen friends . It was very late when he got back to his hotel , but he could not sleep , for in spite of his bravado he was by no means sure of his ability to keep Emily in hand . If he were forced to make a choice between Emily and Florence , he would have to let Florence go . His recognition of that hard truth made him choke with rage , and he imagined himself subjecting Emily to obscene and degrading tortures . On Thursday the weather was hot and humid and the suffocating air was surcharged with electricity . The Weather Bureau forecast thunderstorms , to be followed by a sharp drop in temperature and high winds as the hurricane rushed northward . The actors at the Farow were glum and silent . Their physical discomfort aggravated their uneasinessabout Emily 's behavior , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived haggard from worry and lack of sleep . Emily appeared five minutes early . She entered , smiling , with an ingratiating " Good morning ! " that included everybody . Thompson , stroking the enormous satin-covered candy box she was carrying , said , " An apple for teacher ? " Her pallor and the dark patches under her eyes were not reassuring . For the first time she looked her age . " Do n't be greedy , darling , " she said with an artificial giggle . " These are for everybody . " With all eyes upon her , she untied the big satin bow , took off the lid , and moved about from person to person . " Have some , wo n't you ? " The actors murmured their thanks as they helped themselves to the exquisite little Viennese chocolates , which had cost more than twenty dollars . " Hey , save some for me ! " said Thompson with exaggerated playfulness , reaching for a handful of chocolates and stuffing several into his mouth . He had to do something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's embarrassment at this obvious and pathetically childish attempt to make amends . He could only hope that it was indicative of something more than momentary contrition . " I 'll leave them right here , " said Emily when she had finished making the rounds . " Please help yourselves , wo n't you ? They 're all for you . "  | " Do n't you like chocolates , Miss Crandall ? " asked Lily Prengle , trembling at her own boldness . Emily beamed upon her . " Oh , I adore them . But I have to keep thinking of the old silhouette . Well , maybe just one ! " With a giggle , she snatched a chocolate and popped it into her mouth , then turned to Thompson . " All right , boss-man , I 'm rarin ' to go ! " But he knew that it was not so . He tactfully avoided rehearsing her scene with Florence and went on to the final scenes of the first act . Emily was most tractable and followed his instructions unquestioningly , even with manufactured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost effectiveness and she paused frequently to wipe the perspiration from her palms . Thompson , feeling sorry for her , several times turned his attention needlessly to other members of the cast merely to give her a brief respite . He saw her look of relief when the interval came at last . When it was over he began with a scene in which she did not appear in order to give her an additional half-hour 's rest . The sky had been darkening , and suddenly the expected storm broke with dramatic fury . Vivid flashes of lightning , visible through the skylight , were followed by the reverberating roll of thunder . The rain came in great sheets that beat upon the glass panes with the solid impact of steel . As the storm increased in violence , the actors grew more and more uneasy , glancing up at the rain-swept skylight and recoiling from the roar of the thunder . Soon it became almost impossible for them to make themselves heard . Thompson clapped his hands loudly to get their attention , so that he could call a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blinding flash , then a deafening peal of thunder . Emily , who had grown paler and more hollow-eyed as the storm progressed , uttered an unearthly scream and threw herself upon the stage , burying her face in her arms . " Oh , God ! Oh , God ! Oh , God ! " she shrieked . " Oh , God save me ! Oh , Jesus , save me ! Mother ! Mother ! Mother ! " Thompson was the first to reach her . He bent over her and , in spite of her struggles , succeeded in picking her up in his arms . As he balanced himself , another bolt flared and cracked . " Oh , save me , save me ! " Emily screamed again , clinging desperately to him . " I ca n't stand it ! I 'll go crazy if it does n't stop ! Oh , Christ , make it stop ! " " You 're all right now . Everything 's all right . It 's all over now , " said Thompson ; then roughly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of my way ! " A lane was quickly opened for him . He carriedEmily , still clutching him and moaning in terror , to the dressingroom . Her maid , McCarthy , and Florence Fulham followed . Thompson put her down gently on the chaise longue , while Nellie quickly drew the window curtains to shut out the lightning flashes . The storm was moving off , and in the dressing-room the sound of the thunder was muffled . Thompson forced his brandy bottle between Emily 's lips and made her take a long swallow . " That 's a little better , is n't it ? " Emily sobbed chokingly . " Oh , God , I 'm terrified . I always have been  --  always , ever since I was a baby . " Thompson looked sharply at her . She was not acting : her fear was genuine and deep . " I think if she could just lie here for a little while , Tommy , " said Florence . " I 'll stay here with Nellie , and we 'll put some cold compresseson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mack , " said Thompson . He closed the dressingroomdoor . " See if you can raise her chauffeur and get him around here . She 's through for today . " As he went back to the stage it occurred to him that this was the first time Florence had entered the star dressing-room since her last appearance under Oscar Farow , and he wondered irrelevantly what her thoughts were as she viewed its new decoration and its new occupant . The cast crowded around to inquire about Emily . " She 'll be all right in a few minutes , " he said curtly , glancing curiously at Peter Quirt , who was busily sweeping the stage . In the excitement , the chocolates had been spilled and trodden upon , and Peter was cleaningup the mess . McCarthy came back and reported that he had located the chauffeur . The car would be around presently . " Do you want to go ahead with the rehearsal ? " Thompson looked up at the skylight and then at the faces of the actors . The rain was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , let 's call it a day . I ca n't do anything with t hat goddam noise . Anyhow , there 's not much I can do without Emily now . You 'd better dismiss them . " " Attention , everybody ! " shouted McCarthy . " That 's all for today . Everybody tomorrow at twelve , and that do n't mean five minutes after . " " Precise old bugger , ai n't he ? " said Reginald Olmsted . Everybody , including McCarthy , laughed.  | " He used to announce the time on the air , " said Thompson . " Oh , there 's just one thing . I 'm getting a little behind schedule , and we may have to start night rehearsals next week . So please arrange your love lives accordingly . " This brought another laugh , and then those who had come prepared for rain began to leave the theater . The others waited for the storm to abate . Before long Pop hobbled onto the stage to say that Emily 's car had arrived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , wait , I 'll tell her myself . " He went to the dressing-room . Emily was sitting up on the chaise longue , a damp cloth on her head . Florence sat beside her , holding her hand . " How 's it going ? " asked Thompson . " Much better , thanks . I 'm sorry to be such a nuisance . " " Forget it ! I have an aunt who reacts the same way . " He invented this female relative for want of something better to say . " Your car 's here and I think you 'll be better off if you go home and get into bed . " " Well , I think so too . Only what about the rehearsal ? " " I 've dismissed the company . I 've done about all I wanted to do today anyhow . " " Then I think I will go . " She got up and , turning to Florence , kissed her impulsively . " Thank you for being so nice to me ! " " Why , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blushing . Assisted by Nellie and Thompson , Emily went to the stage door , where McCarthy was talking to the chauffeur , who had brought a large umbrella with him . " Sure you 're all right ? " said Thompson as Emily stepped under the umbrella . " Yes , thanks . And please forgive me . " " Think I should go with them ? " asked McCarthy . " I do n't know . Well , yes , you may as well . She may want somethingdone . " " Thanks , chief , " said McCarthy . " I 've had a yen to ride in that circus wagon ever since it first knocked me for a loop . " He turned up his coat collar and hurried up the alley . " Do n't you want to share my umbrella ? " said Florence , coming up behind Thompson as he stood in the doorway . " I do n't mind if I do . And while I 'm up , I 'd like to get in on a little of this kissing too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , kid . Could I talk you into having a little drink with me ? "  | " Yes , I think you could if you really tried . " They went to Pinelli 's and sat in a quiet corner over a long drink . They had both had enough of Emily for the day and avoided referringto her . Instead they sought refuge from the dismal present in the roseate past , spending a happy hour romanticizing the good old days of Oscar Farow . He invited her to have dinner with him , but she had an engagement , so he stayed on and dined alone , thankful that Claire was in the country . Later in the evening he called Emily 's maid . A doctor had been in and prescribed some medicines and treatments to relax her . Sleep was what she needed more than anything else , in Nellie 's opinion . Thompson agreed and sent Emily his love . He needed sleep too , but he could never shut his eyes before midnight . He put the Beethoven Ninth and the Missa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over him . Friday was a day of particular tension for the majority of the cast , for it was the last day of their " probationary " period . Emily , Olmsted , Florence , McCarthy , and two or three other actors had signed " run-of-the-play " contracts , under the terms of which the manager waived his right to dismiss them and guaranteed them employment for as long as the play ran . In return , the players agreed to remain in the cast , for the duration of the run , thus assuring the manager of their continuing services , a very important consideration where prominentactors were involved . The minor actors merely had " minimum " contracts , which gave the manager the right to dismiss them , withoutobligation , during the first five days of rehearsal . If they were called for rehearsal on the sixth day , the manager could dismiss them thereafter only upon payment of two weeks ' full salary . Consequently the actors anxiously awaited the fifth day , when the manager usually made up his mind . The tension was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disturbing , unsettled weather . During the night the temperature had fallen sharply , as predicted . The city was lashed by a violent gale that whistled down the canyon-like streets , carrying away hats , tearing down shop signs , smashing plate glass , blinding pedestrians with whirling eddies of debris . People with upturned coat collars shouldered their way along in the lee of buildings , or , at the risk of perilous collisions , butted the cold wind with lowered heads . The alley of the Farow Theater swirled with flying litter . On the drafty stage the actors huddled in their overcoats or walked up and down to keep their blood in circulation . Every time the stage doorp188opened a chilling gust sent papers flying and set the pendant work light and the overhead rigging swaying and creaking . From the roof came the incessant rattle of the skylight panes . Thompson usually spent a few minutes exchanging pleasantries with the actors , but today no one was in the mood for levity . He went over to McCarthy , who was standing with Harry Baumrucker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do about that bloody racket , boys ? " The carpenter shook his head . " I came around early , thinkin ' it might give you some trouble , and I been up there nearly an hour . There 's nothin ' loose up there , but with all that glass there 's just nothin ' you can do about it , with a wind like this . " " Yes , I remember playing here once when we had one of these things going . It was a heavy piece about a lot of trapped miners , and the wind would hang around up there until somebody had a speech about , oh , God , how much longer do we have to endure this awful silence , and then down it would zoom z-z-z-z-z ! It 's about the only time in the show we got a laugh . " A few of the actors tittered feebly ; the rest listened in glum silence . Reginald Olmsted came forward , rubbing his hands . " I say , Tommy , could n't we get a little heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pneumonia . " " How about it , Harry ? Any chance of heat ? " " Well , it 's City Steam , you know , " said the carpenter . " I called them and they said they do n't start till October , unless they get orders from the Health Department . " " And the Health Department 's in Bermuda , I suppose . Well , boys and girls , look 's like we 'll just have to make the best of it . " He turned to McCarthy . " Is Emily here ? " he asked , thinking she might be in the dressing-room . " No , sir , " said McCarthy reluctantly . " Her maid called me this morning . She had a bad night and she ca n't get here before one at the earliest . " " Oh , nuts ! " said Thompson under his breath . " All right , let 's do as much as we can without her . Start at the beginning . " " Stand by for Act One , Scene One , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes , sir , " said Peter , swiftly swinging the chairs and tables into place . " Want me to stand in for Emily ? " asked McCarthy.  | " Let Gladys do it . She looks it a little more than you do . " Gladys curtsied . " Thanks , Mr. Thompson . " Lily Prengle came forward quickly . " Excuse me , Mr. Thompson , " she said tremulously . " Could I do it ? " " Do what ? " he asked irritably . " Stand in for Miss Crandall . I know it . " " What do you mean you know it ? " " I know the part . Do n't you remember , you told me to study it if I wanted to ? " " Well , you have n't let the grass grow under your feet , have you ? Sure , go ahead if you know it . " Ordinarily there was an understudy for every part in the play , so that , in case of illness , someone was always ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance , it was impossible to offer the audience a substitute . If she was unable to go on , the performance would have to be canceled . So Thompson had engaged no understudy for her . However , when Lily had asked him for a script , in order to study the part on her own , he had readily acquiesced . He always did what he could to encourage ambitious young actors . As Thompson came down the steps to the auditorium Eric walked down the aisle toward him . " I 'm worried about Miss Crandall , " he said . " Boy , you 're right on the ball , " said Thompson with unconcealed sarcasm . " Do you think she 'll be able to go through with it ? " " If I could answer questions like that , I would n't be mucking around the theater . I 'd be down at Belmont Park , picking the winners . " " What will happen if she ca n't ? " Eric persisted . " I 'll jump off the Leaning Tower of Pisa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you think ? " He moved down to the orchestrarail . " Whenever you 're ready , Mack , " he said , unscrewing the cap of his brandy bottle . Eric went back , angrily , to his accustomedseat . The rehearsal began , and the actors went through their lines and business , mechanically , until the first entrance of Rhoda , the play 's heroine . So far , the actors had made little attempt at characterization and had barely begun to memorize their lines . All that would come in due time . But for Lily Prengle this was the one chance to show Thompson what she could do . She came on , prepared to give a performance  --  and , to the surprise of everyone , she did give a perform/led , half carried off , he clapped Peter on the shoulder . " Hurry up and get a taxi ! " Thompson went to the dressing-room . Emily lay on the chaise longue , panting heavily . " Get her into her coat , " he said . Nellie and McCarthy complied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mack . She 'll never be able to walk . " McCarthy picked her up in his arms ; she slumped against his shoulder . " Go with her , " said Thompson , " and do n't leave until she 's got a doctor and a nurse and whatever she needs . If you need me , phone me here or at the office . " He stood at the stage door while McCarthy carried Emily up the windswept alley . Then he walked back slowly to the stage . The actorswere waiting gloomily , some of them clustered about Lily . When she saw Thompson she sprang to her feet and rushed to him . " Oh , Mr. Thompson , please forgive me ! I know it 's all my fault and I feel so awful about it . But I did n't mean to do anything wrong , honestly I did n't ! " He took the sobbing girl in his arms and held her soft , slender body close to his . " Do n't be silly . It 's not your fault . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only please do n't fire me , please do n't ! You 've been so wonderful to me , giving me this chance . I 'll die if you fire me now . " " I 'm not going to fire you , you little dope . Go sit down and shut up . " He kissed her forehead , swung her around , and gave her a shove . She went back to her chair and sat looking at him with frightened , swimming eyes . Thompson addressed the assembled company . " Well , boys and girls , let 's call it a day . Everybody here at twelve tomorrow , please . And that means everybody , " he added by way of reassurance . Ordinarilythe probationers would have been delighted by this guarantyof security , but now the whole future of the production was in jeopardy . Florence rose . " May I say a word , Tommy ? " " The chair recognizes Miss Fulham . " " Well , it 's just that I feel that we should all keep very , very quiet about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the play or anybody any good to have it talked around . So I think we should agree that we 'll just keep it all right in the family . " There was a general murmur of assent . Thompson said , " Thanks for saying it for me , Flossie . " But he knew that twenty actors couldp143not be depended upon to keep secret so juicy a bit of scandal . The actors gathered up their things and drifted out of the theater . Olmsted lingered . " You 're not really expecting to go on with her , Tommy ? " he said . " You know as much about it as I do . What do you say we just let it ride and see what happens ? " " About all we can do , I expect . Charming place , the theater . My father was all for my going into the Army . Damn near broke his heart when I put on grease paint . I often wish I 'd listened to the dear old chap . " " Never too late , Reggie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumper . I 'm thinking of going into the embalming trade myself . " He noticed Eric getting into his overcoat and went over to him , feeling that he should make some amends for his rudeness . " Having fun , Eric ? " " Not very much . What 's going to happen now ? " Though still resentful , he could not help admiring the self-possession with which Thompson handled the whole situation . " You 're always right there with the hard-to-answer questions . Maybe this breeze will blow the goddam town off the map , and that 'll solve all our problems . " He clapped Eric on the shoulder . " See you tomorrow ! " He went to his office and called Fineman and Winternitz into conference . They received his news glumly , aware of the gravity of the situation . " What about the press , " said Winternitz , " respecting whose freedomCongress shall make no laws ? I suppose you know that this is going to push Stalin right off page one , and jeez , will he burn ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts they would n't tell . " " Pardon me , effendi , " said Winternitz , " are you referring to duespayingmembers of the Actors ' Equity Association , sometimes referred to as Thespians , an appellation derived from Thespis , reputed founder of the drama of ancient Attica , cradle of our Western culture ? " He looked at his watch . " In twenty minutes flat , I 'll have the entire fourth estate on my neck , and I just washed it this morningtoo . " " See what you can do with the boys , Doc , " said Thompson . He relied upon Winternitz , who was on excellent terms with the drama editors , to have the story handled as discreetly as possible.  |p194Winternitz  sprang to his feet and saluted . " Entendu , mon capitaine ! You may depend upon Winternitz to carry the message to Garcia , but gosh you 're not making it easy . " As he ducked out of the office Thompson threw a desk calendar at him . " What about the bookings ? " asked Fineman . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fineman whistled . " They 're practically sold out for the engagement . Twelve thousand fish in the kitty . That 's a lot of moola . " " All right , it 's a lot of moola ! And there 's a lot of gold buried at Fort Knox . So what ? I ca n't open this show in New Haven three weeks from last night . Do I make myself clear ? " " Well , we 'll just have to refund , I guess , " said Fineman ruefully . " What about Boston ? " " Hold on to Boston for a few days more . That does n't look good either , but I do n't want to let it go until I 'm sure . " " They 've got a big advance in Boston too . " " Listen , Murray , why do n't you go out and rob a bank or something ? But first go around to the booking office and explain the whole thing to them . Tell them we 'll let them know definitely by the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the receptionist announced McCarthy . " It 's Mack . He may have some news , though I doubt it . Okay , Murray  --  or is there something else on your mind ? " " Tony Weir went off on his vacation without ever sending around those booking contracts for the Farow . I wanted to tell you sooner , but you 've been so busy I did n't like to bother you . " " I 'm never too busy to hear about your troubles , Murray . But the way things look now there 's no great hurry about booking the Farow . " " Will they hold it for you if you have to postpone ? " asked Fineman . Thompson looked at him . This was something he had not thought of . " Why , certainly they 'll hold it ! I 'll take it up with Claire . Of course , there 's a good chance we may not open at all . " " I guess you know that you 're already in for twenty grand  --  at least twenty ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus , if I ever do Hamlet I 'll know where to look for the first gravedigger  --  and the second ! " " I 'm just trying to tell you what the score is , " said Fineman , stalking out of the office in a huff . Thompson sent for McCarthy . " Well ? "  | " Well , we got her home , all right , and put her to bed . She was carrying on like nobody 's business , but we got the doctor there on the double  --  Corcoran , I think his name is  --  and he gave her a shot to quiet her . Then he phoned for a nurse and Nellie called up some doctor in Hollywood  --  some peculiar name that I ca n't remember  --  " " Wait a minute ! " said Thompson . " Was it Thwaite ? " " Yeah , that 's it . " " He was taking care of her out there . Go ahead . " " Well , Nellie told him what was what , so he said he 'd see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen minutes later he called back to say he was leaving pronto and was due in here first thing in the morning . By that time Emily was asleep and the nurse was there , so I thought I might as well pull out . " " Maybe we ought to get in touch with her family or somebody . Has she got any people , I wonder ? " " I talked to Nellie about that , " said McCarthy , " and it seems not . She 's an only child and her mother 's been dead for years . She 's got a father , but according to Nellie he 's an old jerk that she set up in a gas station in Omaha and has n't seen in God knows when . Then there 's that husband of hers , Duke Something-or-other  --  " " Count Pedro Partagas , otherwise known as Bo-Bo . He 'd be worse than nobody . Anyhow , he 's in Nevada , getting a divorce . " " That 's what Nellie said . So I asked her , well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy friend . But Nellie says there 's nothing like that , right now  --  at least nobody she cares that much about . Of course , she knows a lot of people on the Coast , but Nellie 's afraid of spreading it around out there , with the gossip columns and everything . She did call that agent here , but I do n't think there 's much he can do . " " Paul Kipner ! " said Thompson , horrified . " God God , imagine having nobody in the world to turn to except some Hollywood specialist and Paul Kipner ! That 's pretty tragic . " In sudden panic he wondered how many he could turn to . At least he had Claire and his brother Andrew . " Yeah , I was thinking the same thing myself , " said McCarthy . " You know , I feel kind of sorry for her in a way . I think half the time she does n't know what the hell she 's saying or doing . " He rose . " Anything I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mack . Thanks a lot . You 've been a big help . " " Well , this has been kind of a headache for you . I 'll be in myp196room , if you do want me . Oh , Dick Ismay is out there . I told him I 'd let you know . Do you want to see him ? " " Is he quitting ? " " He did n't say , " said McCarthy tactfully . " Shall I send him in ? " " Yes , may as well . Oh , and if I 'm a little late tomorrow , just take them through without mc . Let Lily read the part . " " Say , was n't that laid good , though ? " Thompson passed his hand over his forehead . " Too damn good , if you ask mc . " " Yeah , you 've got something there . Well , so long , chief , see you tomorrow . " He left , and a moment later Richard Ismay entered , obviously ill at case . " Sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Thompson , knowingthe answer . " Well , I hate to bother you , Mr. Thompson , when I know all you 're up against , " said the actor , wetting his lips , " but I just had to see you and  --  " Thompson stretched out his hand . " You 're turning in your part ? " " Well , yes , sir , I 'm afraid I am . " He took the part from his pocket . " I 've been offered another job and I feel that I have to take it . " " You did n't waste much time , did you ? " said Thompson , taking the creased pages from him . " They 've been talking to me about it for a long time , and I had to give an answer today , because rehearsals start Monday . It 's the new Jack Homburg production and  --  " Thompson laughed . " Jack Homburg ! " " Yes , I know . But it 's a fat part and he 's giving me a good salary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in the oven , and I ca n't afford to turn it down . Naturally , I 'd rather work for you , but the way things look now  --  " " You do n't have to explain to me how things look now , " said Thompson sharply . " All I mean is  --  " " I know what you mean . " He held up the part . " Of course , you know that I do n't have to accept this . " " How do you mean ? " said Ismay nervously . " It 's only the fifth day . " " Technically the fifth day ended when I dismissed the company this afternoon . Technically you owe me two weeks ' salary . " Hep197laughed aloud at the look of horror on Ismay 's face . " Do n't worry . I would n't want to come between an actor and Jack Homburg . " I Ic threw the part on the desk and rose . " I 've got a few things to do , so if  --  " The actor rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , " he said profusely . " And I hope you wo n't hold this against me . " " What the hell do you think I am , a Sicilian vendettist ? " Ismay leaned over the desk and grasped Thompson 's hand . " I ca n't tell you how sorry I am . And I do hope everything turns out for the best for you . " " That is as God wills , " said Thompson , withdrawing his hand from the clammy grip . Ismay left , and Thompson , with a grimace of disgust , wiped his hand on his trousers . In spite of what he had said , he resented the actor 's defection and resolved not to employ him again . He believedthat actors should consider it a privilege to be engaged by him  --  in fact , most of them did  --  and he could not forgive a player who left his employ for that of a notoriously incompetent producer , no matter what the circumstances . He put off calling Poundridge , afraid that Claire would feel it her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend the eveninglistening to her lamentations , he dined with Winternitz , and after dinner went around to the Stuyvesant Theater . The howling winds had no effect on business there . As usual , the house was packed  --  a state of affairs that went a long way in compensating for the disasters at the Farow . He spent an hour in the box-office , watched the performance for a while , and then , feeling that it was sufficiently late to telephone Claire , went up to the house manager 's little office , where he could talk in privacy . As he had expected , even his very subdued version of the day 's occurrences threw her into a state of consternation . " If you 'd only called me earlier , " she said , " I 'd have come right in to keep you company . " " That would have been nice , but this is the first moment I 've had . It 's been a pretty hectic day , when you add it all up . " " Yes , I can imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , she 's a pretty sick girl , " said Thompson . " Oh yes ! A spoiled , conceited , self-centered little good-fornothing , you mean . If she 's so sick , why did she take the part in the first place ? "  | " There 's not much use going into that now . I think maybe we 'd better get together in the morning , though , and talk things over . Can you be at the office at eleven ? " " Yes , of course ! I could even drive in now , except that the weather 's so awful . " " Do n't do that , " he said . " It 's much too late and I 'm dead on my feet . " " Oh , you poor dear , you must be ! Where are you now ? " " Just on my way to dinner . " " Goodness , have n't you eaten yet ? You 'll get sick if you do n't take better care of yourself . " " No , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get hit by a falling skyscraper . You have a little wind up there ? " " A little wind ! It 's the worst thing I 've ever seen in my life . We 've had some trees down , but not near the house , and none of the copper beeches , thank goodness . Well , love and kisses to you , honey . Do get a good rest and I 'll see you at eleven . " " Good night . Love to you . " He went backstage , for what remained of the performance , talked to the actors and stagehands , and watched bits and snatches of the play from the wings . He invited Rose Lowden , who played the feminine lead , to have a drink with him after the show , and sat in her dressing-room while she removed her make-up and changed her clothes . She was not embarrassed by his presence . At one point , when she asked him to turn his head away , he complied instantly . They had known each other for a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like most actresses who worked in his productions  --  andmany who did not  --  she was a little bit in love with him . She was happily married and the mother of two children , and , though she liked him to kiss and fondle her , she had made it clear that he must not go too far . So they kept up a sort of running flirtation , showering each other with loving epithets and expressions of violent passion , a game that amused and titillated them both . Thompson believed that any woman 's resistance could be overcome , but since he was only mildly attracted to Rose Lowden he did not want to risk wounding his ego by putting her to the test . They went around to Pinelli 's and sat drinking and gossiping for an hour . When he dropped her at her apartment he gave her a hearty good-night kiss , to which she responded with equal heartiness . It was an agreeable ending to what had been a very bad day indeed.  |p199Eric  left the theater in a state of agitation . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuance and that the productionmight have to be indefinitely postponed or possibly abandoned . He went across the street to O'Leary 's and telephoned Irina Lanski . She had someone with her and suggested that he come around to her office , in an hour , when they could talk freely . He sat down at a table and ordered a sandwich and a glass of beer . The radio was on , tuned to a program of jazz records , which was interrupted presently for the hourly news broadcast . The news was mostly of the hurrricane . Eric , who was only half listening , sat up in alarm as the announcer described the progress of the storm in central Connecticut . Several communities had been badly hit , with property damage and some loss of life . Among the towns affectedwas Coltertown . Terrified , Eric hurried to the telephone booth and put in a call to his mother . After a long wait a Hartford operator informed him that service to Coltertown had been interruptedand there was no telling when it would be resumed . He leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart in his throat . Then , feeling that he must get home at once , he called Grand Central Terminal . There was an express to Hartford in twenty minutes . He hurried to the station , ignoring the traffic signals and ( lodging among the trucks and taxis , something he would not have dared to do two weeks earlier . He made the train , with five minutes to spare . Not until he sank , panting , into a seat did it occur to him that he should have telephoned Irina Lanski , who would be waiting for him . But Irina Lanski , Emily , Thompson , his play , all seemed unimportantnow . His one thought was for the safety of his parents , the  |p200La  Pointes , Sylvia and her family . He tried not to think of what he would do if anything serious had happened to any of them , his mother in particular . He remembered that he had a letter from Sylvia in his pocket . Preoccupied with his worries about Emily , he had merely glanced at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual complaints about his absence and her resultant loneliness ; the only real news was that she was planning to leave that very evening on her annual two weeks vacation  --  deferred until the end of September , at her employer 's request . Knowing that Eric would be in New York , she had accepted the invitation of a married schoolmate , who lived in the Berkshires , to spend the holiday with her . Eric had been irritated by Sylvia 's constant harping on his neglect of her . He had expected her to be more sensible of his obligation to he in New York and more interested in what he was doing . Now , as he visualized her lying dead or maimed , he reviewed their relationshipfrom its very beginnings and convinced himself that he had been guilty not only of neglect , but of bad faith : he should have married her long ago , obstacles or no obstacles . His common sense reminded him that the obstacles were as much of her making as of his , but in his emotional state he brushed aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the time the train reached Hartford he was overwhelmed by anxiety and remorse . There was still no telephone service to Coltertown . Sick with worry , he hired a taxi to drive him over , unmindful of the cost . The erratic storm had hardly touched Hartford , but along the highway to Coltertown , uprooted trees , overturned cars , and , here and there , a collapsed barn testified to the hurricane 's havoc . Repair crews were at work on the fallen power lines . At several places , where road obstructions channeled the traffic to one lane , swearing , gesticulatingstate troopers tried vainly to relieve the congestion . As the taxi crept along , Eric 's dread of what awaited him grew and grew . He reproached himself for having gone to New York instead of fulfilling his duty at home , shutting his eyes to the fact that his presence in Coltertown would not have lessened the wind 's velocity . The fourteen-mile trip took over two hours , and it was quite dark when he reached home . The street lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great branches that had been torn fromp201the fine old elms lining the road . Eric rushed into the house , which was feebly illuminated by long-unused kerosene lamps and stubby candles set in saucers . In the dining-room his father sat in his wheel chair beside the silent radio , chewing his quid and aimlessly moving his hands . " Hello , Pop ! " Eric shouted , throwing his arms around Kenwood . " Are you all right ? " Kenwood blinked . " Eric ! Where the hell did you come from ? " He was genuinely glad to see his son . " How 's Ma ? Is she all right ? " Before Kenwood could answer Amelia came running in from the kitchen . " Eric ! Eric ! " He kissed her , holding her close . " Thank God you 're all right . I heard the news on the radio and then I tried to get you on the phone  --  " " Yes , I wanted to call you too . But , of course , I could n't . Oh , son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What about Dorothy and Leon ? " " They 're all right . And the Jethrows too . Sam Jethrow came around this morning to see about us . Their place was n't even touched . My , it 's good to see you ! " Eric threw off his coat and sat down , weak with relief . " I thought I 'd never get here . Is there any damage ? " " Well , it 's not as bad as it might have been . " " What happened ? " asked Eric anxiously . " Let 's not talk about it now . Get yourself rested first . You must be just about worn out . " " No , tell me ! " She told him briefly . The wind had increased in violence , all night . Just before dawn the whole house trembled on its foundation , as an uprooted black oak in the back yard crashed onto the roof , tearinga large hole in it . " It 's an act of providence that nobody was sleeping upstairs . When I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanked God that you were n't home . " Eric rose . " I think I 'll go up and take a look . " " I 'll go with you . Just wait till I get a lamp . " " Well , Pop , " said Eric , " that was a lucky escape . You might have all been killed . " " Might have been better for me if I had . "  | " Now , Pop , what 's the idea of talking like that ? " said Eric as Amelia entered with a lighted lamp . But he knew that what his father said was true , and his heart went out to him . He followed his mother upstairs to his room . A great jagged branch had ripped the window sash away and rested on his bed . If he had been home he could hardly have escaped serious injury  --  perhaps death . In the adjoining room a large section of the ceiling had fallen directly on the spot where his parents ' bed had once stood . Eric was suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attic was even worse . The roof , long in need of repair , had crumbled under the impact of the tree 's massive upper branches . To Eric 's surprise , the gaping hole had been hastily patched with some old planks , so that it was partly rainproof . " Who did that ? " he asked . " Leon . He 's been working here all day . I do n't know how I 'd have managed without him . Only I did n't want to talk about it in front of your father . " Dorothy had driven over at daybreak . After seeing the damage , she returned home and asked Leon to go over and help . He had willingly complied  --  for once his mechanical talents counted for more than the superior mental attainments of the Kenwoods . Amelia had managed to keep her husband in the front rooms . If Kenwood knew of Leon 's presence , he had enough good sense left to keep quiet about it . Leon had done what he could to relieve the dangerous pressure on the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Expert in all technical skills , he had done , singlehanded , what ordinarilywould have taken two men twice as long . Eric felt less guilty about his absence , for he would have been of little practical help . While he ate his supper he gave Amelia a softened version of the events at the Farow , not wanting to add to her worries . She was too tired and too glad to have him home to ask many questions or to listen very attentively . He felt that , perhaps , he should go around to the Jethrows , on the chance that Sylvia had not yet left , but the garage door was blocked by debris and he did not relish taking the long walk to the Jethrows in the cold wind . He went to bed in Dorothy 's old room and , away from the harrowingdin of the hotel court , slept long and hard . When he awoke he sat up in bed and looked around in perplexity , not remembering ,  |p203for  the moment , where he was . Leon was already busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors to help him take down the tree and cart it away , in return for the valuable oak wood . Eric offered to help , but Leon told him bluntly that if he really wanted to be useful , he should go around to the farm and give Dorothy a hand . Eric put on some old work clothes of his father 's , cleared the garage door , and set off for the farm . Coltertown was buzzing with activity . The factories had shut down , partly because of the power failure , partly so that the employeescould repair the damage to their homes or lend their neighborsa helping hand . As usual , reflected Eric , it took a catastrophe to bring out the best in everybody . Week in and week out the pulpit , the press , the public platform , and the citizenry in general paid lip-service to " neighborliness " and " community spirit , " but it was only in a time of trouble , such as this , that people forgot their selfish interests and animosities , their religious prejudices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be done . Everywherethe townsfolk were busy , cleaning up the streets and the yards , making repairs , providing for the homeless , removing furniturefrom houses that threatened to collapse . Truck owners were hauling away the debris ; war veterans were helping direct traffic ; everyone was animated by an uncommon spirit of friendliness and concern for the common good . On his way to the farm Eric went by Sylvia 's house . Lydia answered the doorbell . " Oh , hello , Eric . What a surprise ! " she said rather coolly , looking at his patched , baggy clothes and his unshaven face . She did not ask him to come in . He apologized for his appearance , explaining that he had left his own clothes in New York . " Yes , I see , " said Lydia . " When did you get here ? " " Last evening . I wanted to come around but I could n't get the car out . " " And it 's such a long walk . Well , Sylvia will be terribly disappointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonesome . It would have meant a lot to her to see you . " " I did n't think she 'd be home . She wrote me that she was planning to leave right after work yesterday . " He was painfully aware of how lame his excuses sounded . " Well , we were worried about her leaving in that storm . So she waited until this morning . If you 'd come an hour sooner , you'dp204have caught her . And I 'm sure if she 'd known you were here , she would have put off going . " " Oh , I would n't have wanted her to do that , " said Eric . " She sounds pretty run-down and she needs the vacation . " " Yes , she has n't been feeling any too well . And her state of mind is n't too good either . I suppose you 'll be going right back to New York . " " I do n't know just how soon . There 's been a little delay in the production of my play . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too bad . Will you excuse me now ? I 've got some milk heating and I 'm afraid it may boil over . " " Yes , of course . I 've got to get over to the farm anyhow . " He drove off , feeling very contrite . It was clear that the Jethrows were offended by what they regarded as his neglect . He could not continue to allow his relationship to Sylvia to drag on , in this indeterminatefashion . Dorothy was pleased to see him and to have someone to help her . Eric was hardly a substitute for Leon , but he did relieve her of some of the heavier chores . She had begun to fill out , and her approaching maternity was now quite evident . It was a long , long time since the brother and sister had spent a whole day together and both enjoyed it . When Leon returned just before dark , he was amused by Eric 's sweat-streaked face and sagging body . " How 's the new farmhand ? " he said to Dorothy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leon roared with laughter . " Say , you 're right about that ! I would n't know which end of one of them things to tackle . " Eric drove home and took a hot bath and an alcohol rub-down to ease his aching muscles . In the evening telephone service was resumed , but too late for him to call Irina Lanski or Thompson at their offices . He did not know where either of them lived , nor would he be able to reach them next day , which was Sunday . Unless one of them called him , he would have to wait until Monday to find out what was happening in New York.  |p205Thom|pson  left an early call for Saturday in order to be on time for his appointment with Claire . He telephoned Emily 's hotel , only to be informed that she had left instructions not to be called . He decided against going around to see her . When he got to the office Claire was waiting for him . " Any news ? " she asked anxiously . " No . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All right , put him on . " He turned to Claire . " Here 's her doctor . " " Good morning , Mr. Thompson , " said the doctor . " This is Doctor Thwaite . You may remember my calling you from California when  --  " " Yes , of course ! " said Thompson impatiently . " Well , I 'm here in Doctor Corcoran 's office . He and I have just come from Miss Crandall 's and I thought you 'd be interested in getting a report . " " How is she ? " " Frankly , she 's in pretty had shape . I was afraid this was going to happen ; that 's why I came on . I 've seen this coming for a long time . In fact , I strongly advised her against undertaking this play , because I was sure she was n't up to it . She 's been under a continuingnervous and emotional strain , worrying about her work and about some distressing personal problems . " " Yes , I know about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep herself going by a constant alternation of sedatives and stimulants  --  also against my advice , I may say  --  and the resultant shock to her nervous system has been very severe . My diagnosis , with which Doctor Corcoran is entirely in agreement , is that she is suffering from a psychosomatic condition : an anxietyp206neurosis accompanied by some rather troublesome functional dis-turbances . " " Well , I 'm sorry to hear it . I suppose that means she wo n't be able to do the play . " " Oh , that 's quite out of the question . This is going to be a long pull , I 'm afraid . In fact , hospitalization is absolutely essential . I 'm going to put her in a sanitarium in ' Tucson , where she 'll get exactly the care she needs and where I can visit her periodically . " " Is she able to travel ? " " I think so . I 've been in touch with Mr. Kipner  --  I think that 's the name  --  " " Yes , he 's her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a private plane , and , of course , I 'll go along and see her properly settled . " " Well , if there 's anything I can do  --  " " Thanks , but I do n't think so . Mr. Kipner expects that we 'll be able to leave this afternoon , and meanwhile I 'm keeping her under sedatives . I probably sha n't even tell her what our destination is until we actually arrive . What you could do , if you cared to , is write her a little note expressing your understanding of the situation . She has a feeling of guilt about you , and I think a friendly word from you would have a good psychological effect . " " Yes , I 'll be glad to do that . Give me the address , will you ? " He jotted it down . " Do you think if I came around to see her  --  " " No , I do n't recommend that in her present condition . Well , good-by , Mr. Thompson . " " Good-by , Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him . " I guess I should have seen it coming too , " he said . " She seemed awfully jittery when I saw her in Hollywood , but I thought she 'd snap out of it when she got to New York . " " It 's no wonder , with the lives they lead out there , " said Claire pettishly . " Well , " said Thompson , " when you get to looking over the battingaverages , you 'll find there are n't many .300 hitters in any league . " " What are we going to do ? " asked Claire , walking around nervously . " I wish I knew the answer . Let 's get Murray and Doc in here and kick it around . "  |p207Winternitz  and Fineman listened dejectedly to the news . " You 'd better get out a Monday morning release , Doc , " said Thompson . " And try to make it as easy as you can for everybody  --  including her . " " I 've sounded out most of the boys . They 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know about some of the columnists . They do n't decontaminateso easy . " " Do we have to say that she 's entirely out ? " asked Fineman . " Certainly we have to say it ! " said Thompson irritably . " Whothe hell are we kidding ? It 's going to be all over town by tonight . " " Correction , " said Winternitz . " Make that last night . " " All right , I just asked , " said Fineman . " What about the play ? " said Winternitz . " They 're all on me about that . " " Yeah , " said Thompson . They all watched him as he sat makingcrisscross lines on his desk blotter with a paperknife . " You 'd bettersay that I 'm considering several other name actresses for the part . " " Are you ? " asked Winternitz . " What 's that got to do with it ? " " All right , I just asked . " He turned to Fineman . " Any similarity between my line and yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tell him I 'm not in . No , put him on . Hello , Paul . " " I 've got some pretty bad news about Emily , Tommy , " said Kipner . " She 's  --  " " I know all about it . Her doctor called me . " " Poor kid ! Can you imagine a thing like that happening ? She had her heart set on doing this play too . " " Yes , it 's tough for all of us . " " Oh , do n't think I 'm forgetting your end of it . Maybe I can help you find somebody for the part . " " Like who ? " " Well , I have n't really had time to think about it . This thing has hit me like a ball from the blue . " " You mean a bolt from the bull , do n't you ? " " How 's that , Tommy ? " asked Kipner , puzzled . " Nothing . Just a slip of the tongue . Well , I 'm pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me a ring . " " I 'll do that , Tommy . Oh , while I 've got you , what about Emily 's contract ? "  | " Listen , I 've got a few other things on my mind now ! " " All right , do n't get heated up . All I meant was  --  " " See Murray about it next week . Good-by ! " He turned to Fineman . " Emily 's contract . " " Yes , what do you want to do about it ? I meant to ask you . " " What can we do about it ? " " Well , we 've got a run-of-the-play contract . " " For Christ 's sake , Murray ! If she had a broken leg would you hold her to a contract ? Well , I 'd rather have two broken legs than what she 's got  --  and a broken back too . " " All right , he just asked , " said Winternitz , rising . " Well , folks , it 's been a lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll go and apply a little confusal oil to my portable . " " You may want to mention that this has hit Kipner like a ball from the blue . " Winternitz shook his head . " Always thinking of the blue balls of his native Scotland . " " The next thing we 've got to decide is whether we drop the show or go ahead , " said Thompson . " Personally , I think we should try to go ahead . " " How can you go ahead without Emily Crandall ? " asked Claire . " By getting somebody else . The part never was written that only one actress could play . " " Yes , but who ? " " I do n't know yet who . Right now I 'm toying with the idea of Lily Prengle . " " Who is Lily Prengle ? Good heavens , you do n't mean that little blonde who 's playing Aggie ! " " That 's exactly who I mean . Wait a minute ! " he said , checking her expostulation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd know what I 'm talking about . She stood in for Emily , and I want to tell you she went after that part like a bat out of hell . She had my hair standing up on end , and the cast damn near fell out of their chairs . She 's got something , that little lady has . " " Well , I may be talking out of turn , " said Fineman , " but that 's a hell of a chance to run , shooting your bankroll on a kid that 's never done anything . " " Well , that 's the kind of business we 're in . If I 'd never taken any chances or played any hunches I 'd still be a stage manager . If the kid clicked it might be something sensational . "  | " And what if she failed ? " asked Claire . " We 'd be out of luck . You ca n't win every time . " " No , but you do n't have to take that kind of a gamble . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to get somebody with a name , and if I could n't , I 'd drop it . " " You mean you 're ready to pour twenty grand down the drain , with nothing to show for it ? " Claire turned pale . " Twenty thousand dollars ! Why , how can that be ? " " Ask Murray . " " I 've been doing a little figuring since I talked to you . It 's more like twenty-five , " said Fineman . " I ca n't believe it , " said Claire . " It 's impossible . " " Well , I can show you the figures , if you want to see them . First , we 've got the costumes  --  " " We could call them off . " " Not a chance . They 're all cut and we 're stuck with them . Anyhow , we 've got to pay Louis-Jean 's designing fee whether he finishes them or not . And his trip to the Coast was n't peanuts either . Then there 's the scenery  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Claire desperately . " A lot of it is , including those two big platforms . And some of it is painted . And we got to pay the scenic designer 's fee too  --  that 's a little item of five G 's . Then there was Tommy 's trip to the Coast and a lot of miscellaneous . When you put it all down and draw a line under it , it adds up . " " I still ca n't believe it adds up to twenty-five thousand . " " Why go on arguing about it ? " said Thompson impatiently . " He knows what he 's talking about . And another thing , whose pocket is it coming out of ? " " Whose do you suppose ? " said Claire . " The backers , of course . They 'll have to pay pro rata , according to their shares . " " You mean you 're going to stick the Loftings and Kitty Hines and Louis Greenbaum and all those people for a show that never even gets started ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defiantly . " They 've all made plenty out of Give Them . " She was worried about making this embarrassing demand upon her friends and social acquaintances . Such an action would not be likely to encourage them to invest in herp210future enterprises . Yet it was not easy to pay the entire loss out of her own pocket , on top of what she had already put into the Farow Theater . " I do n't think you could hold them even if you wanted to , " said Fineman . " Why not ? " asked Claire angrily . " All we 've got from them so far is pledges . And they 're made on the basis of Emily Crandall being in the show . If we do n't deliver Emily I do n't see where we 've got any claim to hold them . " " I think he 's right , " said Thompson . " Well , I do n't ! " she said sharply . " I think we 'd better have some legal advice on all this . I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had loved anyone else and still hoped he would marry her , she dealt with him at arm 's length when it came to business . Afraid the combination of her lover and Fineman would be too much for her , she wanted the help of Anthony Weir . " I thought he was on his vacation , " said Thompson as she put in the call . " What of it ? He can spend a few minutes on the phone . This is important enough . Oh , and what about the theater ? You 're not going to be ready to open on any October thirtieth , no matter what you do . " " Does n't look much like it . " " Well , what am I supposed to do about the Farow ? " " You do n't have to do anything this minute , do you ? We 'll know in a few days where I 'm at , and if I do n't go ahead you 've still got lots of time to book something else . " " And meanwhile I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish I 'd never let myself be talked into buying the damn theater . " " Do n't look at me . I did n't talk you into buying it , " said Thompson , glad that he had always pretended to be indifferent to her acquisition of the theater . She threw him an angry look as she answered the telephone . " Oh , is that you , Helen ? This is Claire Weir . " " Yes , Mrs. Weir , " said Anthony Weir 's secretary . " Where can I reach Mr. Weir ? There 's something very important I have to consult him about . " " To tell you the truth , Mrs. Weir , I do n't exactly know where to reach him right now . "  | " You do n't know where to reach him ? Why , that 's very odd . He told me he expected to go to Asheville . Is n't he there ? " " Well , he was , until last night , Mrs. Weir . But he phoned to say that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd met . He said he was n't sure just where they were going , but he 'd be in touch with me . " " And you have no idea where he might be ? " " Why , no , I have n't . I may hear from him tonight or maybe not until Monday , but the minute I do I 'll have him call you . Too bad I did n't know last night that you wanted to talk to him . " " This is something that just came up . When he does call , be sure to ask him to ring me at Poundridge right away , and if I should happen not to be there , tell him to leave word where I can reach him . " " I certainly will , Mrs. Weir . And I 'm awfully sorry . " Claire hung up . " I ca n't understand his going off like that , withoutleaving some word where he could be reached . " " He 's off on a bender , " said Fineman . Claire turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say a thing like that ? " she shouted . Fineman got up , with a shrug . " Maybe I talk too much . Tommy , I 'm going to check with Equity on the actors ' contracts . I want to find out just how we stand . " " Okay , Murray . " He waited until Fineman left the room . " Why pick on poor Murray ? It 's not his fault that Tony is off on a binge . " " He should mind his own business and not go around spreading tales about people . " Thompson yawned . " You probably knew it all along . " " Would I have called him if I had ? " asked Claire indignantly . " Helen told me , after the last one , that she was sure he was cured . " " She 's got a tough assignment , that little girl , keeping up a front that fools nobody . Who was it that said the best-kept secrets are the ones everybody knows ? Shaw , I guess . Or maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , baby ? T'ony 'll never be cured . " He rose . " Well , I 'd better go around and talk to the cast . " " Is it all right if I go with you ? " Thompson frowned . " I do n't know , dear . This is going to take a little handling and  --  " " Yes , I know , and I 'd only be in the way . " " I did n't say that . All I meant was  --  "  | " Oh , do n't bother about explaining . I should be used to these moods of yours , but it seems I 'm not . I guess I may as well go back to the country , since I 'm not wanted around here . " Fortunately Fineman returned . " Oh , I just wanted to tell you that I 'm seeing Frank Lundwell at Equity at two . Might be a good idea to have one of the cast there . " " All right , I will , " said Thompson . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll wait around , if you want to come up to the country with me , " said Claire as she and Thompson left the building . " No , I ca n't . I 've got a lot of things to do over the weekend . There 's a pile of scripts that I have to read . Might be something there I could get started on , in case we do have to drop The Clouded Mirror . " " You could read them in the country . " " Too many interruptions . I 'd better stay in town . " " Well , if you do change your mind , let me know , and I 'll send the car in for you . " " All right . Well , I 've got to run . " " My car 's in the Radio City Garage . If you want to wait I 'll drop you at the Farow . " " No , it takes too long . I 'm an hour late already . " " Well , good-by then . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cheek with his lips . " Good-by . I 'll phone you . " He hurried off without looking back . She watched him for a long moment , then , with a deep sigh , walked to the garage . She was feeling very sorry for herself . She was faced not only with the loss of the money she was pouring into the Farow , but with the entire cost of an abortive production as well . Anthony Weir , whose advice was indispensable , failed her when she needed him most . Worst of all , she could never be sure of Thompson . Why , suddenly , was he talking about entrusting a star part to a little nobody ? Did he really think Lily Prengle had that much talent or was there some other reason ? She drove home in misery , obsessed by these torturing thoughts . Thompson found the actors at the Farow listlessly going through the first act , under the guidance of McCarthy . They knew that Richard Ismay had handed in his part , and though there was no news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a pervadingair of pessimism.  | " All right , folks , hold everything , " said McCarthy as Thompsonentered . " Hello , boys and girls , " said Thompson . " How about if we all sit around and have a little fireside chat . " Facetious though his words were , there was no levity in his manner . Thompson swung a chair around and sat facing the cast , his arms resting on the back of the chair . " I 'm going to get right down to Hecuba , " he said . " I 've had a talk with Emily 's doctor and I 'm afraid she 's out . " This was received in dead silence . " I 'm not going to go into details , but you can take my word for it that she 's in a bad way , and it 's going to be a long time before she walks on any stage . If there 's any comfort at all in what 's happened , it 's that it happened here and now and not in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York . " There was a murmur of assent . " But what you all want to know is , where do we go from here ? I wish I could give you the answer , but I have n't had time to work it out . What I can tell you is that I want to go ahead , if it 's possible to do it . I like this play and I have confidence in it and I do n't want to drop it . " He looked around into the darkness . " Are you out there , Eric ? " " No , he did n't show , " said McCarthy . " I phoned his hotel and he 's not there either . That storm hit pretty hard up where he lives , and I figure maybe he went home . " " Well , never mind . To get back to what I was saying , I 've got a casting problem on my hands , and it 's not an easy one , as you know , especially when I have to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month or so , or until I found the right lead and start again from scratch . But I 'd rather keep going , if I can , mainly for the reason that I 'm very happy with this company and I doubt if I could ever assemble another that I liked as well . " Nobody said anything , but he could see that they were pleased . " So I 'm hoping that we can work out something together . This is a kind of special case , with a star involved and all , and Murray Fineman is going around this afternoon to get the Equity slant on it . By the way , who 's the Equity deputy ? " " I am , " said Clark Yardley , a young actor who played the part of a country doctor . The actors ' union required every company to elect a deputy from among its members , to serve as a sort of liaison officer between the cast and the union and to adjust any minor differences that might arise backstage.  | " Oh , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , you always struck me as the ward-heeler type . Can you get my grandfather a job in the Sanitation Department ? " This brought a laugh . The atmosphere was a little easier . " I 'm incorruptible , " said Yardley . " Well , incorrupt yourself around to Equity at two , will you , to talk it over with Murray and Frank Lundwell ? " " I 'll do it . " " Stout fellow . Well , that takes care of that . Now , I know what this means to all of you , not only as actors but as people with responsibilities , and I do n't expect you to hang on indefinitely . But unless somebody 's got something really hot on the fire , I would like you all to string along for a while and give me a chance to get this thing on its feet . " " Well , I think the least we can all do is give Mr. Thompson a chance , " said Florence Fulham . There were several expressions of agreement , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Florence , were obviously dubious . " How long would you expect us to wait , Tommy ? " asked Olmsted . " I 'd say a week  --  ten days at the most . If nothing 's cooking by then , I certainly would n't want to hold you any longer . Of course , we 'll continue rehearsal pay while you 're waiting  --  for whatever cigarettes that 's worth . " " Could we have a chance to discuss it among ourselves ? " said Yardley . " I can do a little better than that . Why do n't we just let everythingride over the weekend ? By that time we 'll have the Equity angle and you 'll have had a chance to discuss it not only among yourselves but with your wives , ex-wives , future wives , and chiro-practors . " " That seems fair enough , " said Yardley . " All those in favor raise their hands . " Everybody 's hand went up . " It 's unanimous . " Thompson rose and bowed . " The people 's choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday at one . And when I say thank you all very much , I mean thank you all very much . " Several of the actors lingered to assure Thompson that he could count upon them . An elderly man , named James Lawless , grasped his hand . " I just want to say that if all managers showed actors the same courtesy and consideration that you do , this would be a happier profession to be in. "  | " Well , I 'm a frustrated actor myself , " said Thompson , touched . Lily Prengle hovered in the background until everybody but McCarthy had left . Then she came over to Thompson , trembling and hardly able to talk . " Mr. Thompson , could I talk to you for a minute ? " " Yes , sure . Sit down , " he said , knowing very well what was coming . " I 'm going upstairs for a minute , boss , " said McCarthy tactfully . " Just yell when you want me . " " All right , Galahad , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you could play the part of Rhoda , please , Mr. Thomp-son ? " " Do n't laugh at me . I know I have an awful nerve . But I know I could do it . I just know I could . You thought I was good yesterday . And it was the first time I tried it and I was just shaking , with you and everybody watching me . You said I was good . " " Yes , and I meant it too . But that part is quite a lot to bite off for a very small mouth . " He took hold of her nose and chin , pulled her mouth open , and peered in . " Not a wisdom tooth in sight . " " I know I 'm young and have n't had much experience , but this is one part I 'm sure I could play . And with your direction and all . Oh , please , give me a chance ! Everybody says how you 're always giving young actors chances . So why not me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , with a million bloodthirsty females hammering at my door ? " " Yes , you did . And I 'll always be grateful to you for it . But this might be the one big chance of my life . It could mean just everything in the world to me . " " It might mean the bailiffs for me , my girl , and a miserable end in the debtors ' prison . It takes a lot of dough to put on a show . Say , that 's a neat idea for a lyric . I must speak to Sir Arthur about it . What I am talking about , Snow White , is mazuma , sometimes vulgarly referred to as money . The rustle of an angry angel 's wings is not a pretty sound . It would be nice if we could all do it just for fun , but under the free enterprise system you ca n't do things for free . " He rose . " Do n't be downhearted . You 'll go places yet . " She stood up and took his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you at least think it over ? " " Oh , sure , I think about all sorts of things all the time . "  | " No , I mean seriously . At least give me a chance to read the part for you . " He hesitated . " Well  --  I ' 11 tell you what I 'll do . Let 's see what happens Monday , and if we decide to go ahead , maybe I 'll let you read for me . " " Oh , thank you ! Thank you ! " she said effusively . He laughed . " All right , get out of here now ! " He took her by the nape of the neck , held her there for a moment , and then pushed her toward the stage door . She went up the alley with her spine tingling , wishing that she could remember forever the pressure of his fingers on her neck . McCarthy heard the stage door close and came downstairs . " Do you think she could do it , chief ? " Thompson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an awful chance . " They went across the street to O'Leary 's , had a drink and something to eat , and reviewed the rehearsal schedule , discussing the various contingencies . In ten minutes Thompson had forgotten all about Lily . His muscles still painfully sore , Eric spent all of Sunday working about the house . The fallen tree had left a gaping hole , which he filled with rubbish , crushing it down with large field stones and leveling it off with several barrowfuls of soil . In the afternoon Irma Lanski telephoned to give him the bad news about Emily . Thompson wanted to see him , on Monday , to talk over the situation . She made no attempt to conceal its seriousness . Early Monday morning Eric set off for the city once more , on what seemed the most hopeless of all his journeys . The New York paper he bought in Hartford carried the story about Emily sub/stantially as Winternitz had written it . It merely said that she had had a nervous breakdown as a result of overwork , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be found . There was no reference to the scandalous incidents at the Farow . Eric and Irina Lanski arrived at Thompson 's office almost simultaneouslyand were shown in immediately . " Hello , Eric , " said Thompson . " How did you find things at home ? " " Nobody hurt luckily . But an uprooted tree tore a big hole in our roof . " " Well , the roof fell in on us here too . " " Yes , I know , " said Eric . " But according to the morning paper you 're planning to go ahead . " " That 's public relations . Like those war communiques , where our gallant troops arc always falling back to more favorable posi-tions . " " You mean you 're not going to do the play ? " asked Eric , his mouth and throat dry and his eyeballs burning . " No , I do n't mean that . All I mean is that at this moment I do n't know where the hell I am . I 've just had a session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a reasonable length of time . Frank Lundwellof Equity was there , and we fixed it so that they 'll continue for ten days on rehearsal pay . If by then I ca n't cast the part , all bets are off and nobody 's bound . It 's a special concession , but Lundwell is sure it 'll be approved by the Equity Council . That gives me ten days to turn around in . The next problem is where to turn . " " Do n't you think that Miss Prengle could do it ? " said Eric . " I liked the way she did it the other day . " " So did I. And I 've been thinking it over . She 's been on my neck about it , and I 'm going to give her a reading . But , Jesus , I do n't know . " " Excuse me , " said Irina Lanski , " but do n't you think that 's rather risky ? " " I wish you 'd heard her the other day , " said Eric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , " but it takes more than just ability to carry a part like that in New York . " She had had a full report of everything that had happened from Florence Fulham . " That 's it , " said Thompson . " If it were summer stock or even a road company I 'd take a chance . But this part calls for experience and for technique , and she has n't got either . I can give her a lot , of course , but I doubt if she 'd ever be able to sustain that long part . "  | " Would n't it look rather funny too , " said Irina Lanski , " to have an unknown little girl supported by Reggie Olmsted and Flossie Fulham ? " " Yes , it would . I 'm not sure they 'd do it . Besides , she would n't rate any billing  --  not before we opened anyhow  --  and that would throw the whole thing out of balance . If we 'd started with her it might have been different . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Nobody from Nowhere . No , I think we 'd better count Lily out . " " Is n't there someone else in Hollywood who  --  ? " " I 've been all over that . I even thought of flying out there again . But it would be a waste of time . I went over the situation pretty thoroughly last summer , while I was waiting for Emily to make up her mind . The girls I can get I do n't want , and the ones I 'd settle for ca n't be pried loose . There 's just one possibility , and that 's May Weeks . Do you know her ? " he asked Eric . " I think I 've seen her once or twice in the movies . " " She 's not a bad little actress . And she has n't been out there long enough for it to get her down . Of course , she 's not the kind of box-office that Crandall is , but her name would mean something . " " Is there any chance of getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just had her on the phone . She wants to do a play , but she 's starting a picture next week and wo n't be available till the end of the year . That would mean postponing until January . " " January ! " exclaimed Eric . " At the earliest . That complicates things for me . I could n't hold the cast , of course . Besides , it means that I 've either got to sit around and wait or else start work on another show , in which case I probably wo n't he free in January . " " It does n't sound very promising , " said Irina Lanski . " No , it does n't . But I 'm air-mailing her a script . I should have an answer by the end of the week . If she wants to do it and we can get together on it , I 'll see if I can work out the time schedule . " " What about that Miss Upton ? " asked Eric . " I saw her when I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been thinking about her too . As a matter of fact I tried to reach her , but she 's in Chicago , doing a radio show , and wo n't be back until Saturday . By that time I ought to have some word from May Weeks . If it 's no , I 'll talk to Ginny . But I do n't think she 'll want to do it . She 's never played anything butp219comedy , and I 'd have a hard time convincing her that this is a comedy . " " Yes , I think you would . But are n't there some other actresses  --  " " There are thousands of actresses , but very few of them know how to act . I 'm not going to risk my reputation and a bushel basket of somebody 's jack by doing this play with some girl I have n't got confidence in . " " No , that would be foolish , " said Irina Lanski . " Well , perhaps you will think of someone else . " " I 'll keep pegging away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep on this thing , and if there 's any chance of saving it , I certainly will . " " I guess there 's not much use my staying in New York , " Eric said , for want of anything else to say . " Well , not on my account . If we need you we 'll let you know . We 've had a tough break , but if you 're going to stay in the theater there 's one thing you 'd better learn early and never forget , and that is that there 's no law that compels anybody to be a playwright  --  or a producer . " " Except the divine law that forbids us to kill the creativeness that is within us , " said Irina Lanski . At her suggestion Eric went around to her office with her . Myra Leech looked up from her clattering typewriter to give him a brief nod as they went into the inner office . " Well , " Irina Lanski said when she had lighted a cigar , " I suppose you will think me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not give up hope ; but , believe me , it is the most important thing that I can say to you . " " It would be all right if that were all there is to it . Or if I had only myself to think of . But I gave up my job so that I could be here for rehearsals . I 've been living on the few hundred dollars that I 'd saved up , and that 's not going to last very long . My father has locomotor ataxia and has n't been able to work for years , and there 's no one but me to look after him and my mother . " " You ca n't go back to your job ? Temporarily , I mean , until we can get a play produced . " " They 're pretty sore at me for leaving , and I do n't think they 'd take me back . I do n't want to go back either . I only hung on as long as I did because I had to , but the thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beg them if I have to  --  but only as a last resort . " 220She nodded gravely . " I understand how you feel . When one is burning to create , it is hard to grind one 's youth away at sterile work . " " If I could only find something where there was a little chance for initiative , or some hope of getting on to something better . But I have n't any right to bother you with all this . " " Do n't talk like a fool ! " She pointed to the pile of playscripts on her desk . " Do you see that heap of garbage that I have to wade through , every day of my life  --  turning the pages with one hand and holding my nose with the other ? Do n't you think it means something to me to find a young writer with talent ? Well , we 'll have to put our heads together and think of something . " Her words and the warmth behind them heartened him . " If I could only find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with the theater or was related in some way to writing . I do n't know just what  --  a playrcader or a job on a newspaper or with a publisher . Do you see any chance of anything like that ? " " I do n't know , " she said dubiously . " Playreaders hardly exist any more . Those managers who can read do their own reading . The others have their plays read by their telephone operators , their mistresses , their mistresses ' mothers , and their barbers . If you went more often to the theater that would be obvious to you . As for newspapers and publishers ' offices , there are usually ten applicants for every job . And they do n't pay much to beginners . Radio writing , perhaps . I could look into that . But there 's no security in that until you are well established , and that takes time of course . How much certain income must you have ? " " Well , to take care of my parents and pay my expenses in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded preposterously high . She shook her head . " That 's very difficult . For someone without special training or experience fifty dollars would be the most you could expect to begin with . Of course , if you had a play running I could get you a Hollywood job at five hundred a week . " Eric laughed ruefully . " If I had a play running I would n't need a Hollywood job . " " Exactly . The less you need it , the more they want you . The worshipers of the bitch-goddess Success are not in the market for unrecognized talent . " " I know . To him that hath shall be given , and from him thatp221bath not shall be taken away . Well , I 'll go back home and try to think it out . " She extended her hand . " I 'll think about it too . And remember , it 's too soon to give up all hope about the play . " He pressed her hand warmly . " I do n't know how to thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something for you . " He went to his hotel , feeling a little better for his talk with her . The suspicious manager , accustomed to delinquent guests , was on the point of clearing his room and impounding his belongings . Eric paid what he owed , including that night 's rent , for it was too late to start for Coltertown . The stuffy little room seemed drearier than ever . Now that the merciless city was ejecting him and sending him home , in defeat , like so many countless thousands before him , the cacophony of the court seemed like a mocking dirge to his hopes . After a sleepless night he took the first morning train to Hartford . Eric spent the next few days making arrangements for the needed repairs to the Kenwood house . To his consternation , the cost came to over two hundred dollars . This unexpected inroad upon his fastdwindlingbank account was really alarming . His New York expenseshad been considerably in excess of his estimate . The two dollars a day he had allowed himself for food had been insufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an occasional drink and other minor incidentals had substantially increased his outlay . The repair bills did not have to be paid immediately , but the money had to be there to meet them eventually , and what was left would barely last another six weeks . Even should May Weeks be available , he had not nearly enough to carry him until January and through the ensuingrehearsal period . It was therefore imperative that he find immediateemployment . Since Coltertown offered little or nothing , he decided after consideringevery phase of the situation to try to find a job in Hartford , where there were more opportunities . He could continue to live at home , so that his only additional expense would be the cost of transportation . He bought the Hartford papers every day and carefully read all the help wanted advertisements . There were few jobs for which he was qualified . He had no manual skill and none of the qualities or experiencerequired of salesmen or canvassers . About all that he could hope for was a minor clerical position , and here too a knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines wasp222a requisite . He marked everything that looked even remotely possibleand wrote the most persuasive letters of application that he was capable of . Twice he got up at daybreak and drove to Hartford to apply in person , but either the job had been filled before his turn came or he was not satisfactory . The Hartford employment agencies promised to do what they could , though they made it clear that his lack of special training was a serious handicap . His friend James Duncan , to whom he turned for advice , introducedhim to the business manager of the Coltertown Evening Standard , who offered him employment as an advertising solicitor , on a commission basis ; but that promised no fixed income . Duncan also suggested that he look into the possibilities of getting a civil service job . As a veteran he had priority , and civil service employment meant security of tenure and slow but certain promotion . Besides , the hours were much shorter than in private employment , a very important consideration , for he was determined to go on with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the federaland state services . Again , the jobs were mostly of a technological nature , or else called for service in Washington or some remote place where the meager governmental pay would not begin to meet the expense of his living away from home and providing for his family too . The only promising examination was one that was to be held the following week for the job of proofreader on state publications . He registered for the examination , borrowed a manual of proofreading from the Evening Standard , and studied it assiduously . Amelia , without telling Eric , went to the head of the school board , to ask about the possibilities of her resuming her work as a teacher . She was received with kindness and given a vague promise that an effort would be made to take her on as a substitute after the beginning of the new year . Kenwood was neither sympathetic to Eric 's problem nor reticent about condemning him for his rashness and irresponsibility . It was a black week for Eric , relieved only by the receipt of anotherinstallment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' respite , besides signifying that Thompson had not yet abandonedthe play . To add to his worries , Sylvia was constantly in his thoughts . He could no longer put off coming to a definite understanding with her . Shutting himself up in his room , he spent a whole evening writing her a long and intimate letter . After describing what had happenedp223in New York and explaining its probable effect upon the production of his play , he came to the real purpose of his letter , which was to ask her to marry him . He had always assumed , he wrote , that they would eventually marry ; only economic difficulties had prevented their union . It might seem odd therefore , he said quizzically , that he should wait until his prospects were bleaker than ever , but this apparentinconsistency was explicable by his concern about her ambiguoussituation . With understanding and tenderness he expressed his feeling that their relationship should be given permanence and public status . The path before them was not easy , but , once married and secure in their mutual love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obstacles . He would somehow find a way to make a living ; perhaps she would be willing to go on working until he was able to provide for them both . He would not expect her to live under the same roof with his father . But if she wished , he would be willing to move into the Jethrow house , or they could go on living as they were and spend all their non-working hours together . Though far from an ideal arrangement , it would be infinitely better than the present one , for they would be married and working together for a happier future . He wished that he had more to offer her , but hoped she would share his faith in their ability to work things out . Again , he asked her to overlook his past shortcomings , and ended by saying that he eagerly awaited her answer . Though he could not imbue it with a passion he did not feel , it was a sincere , thoughtful , and deeply felt letter , full of warmth and affection . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it off , feelingthat he had corrected a grave injustice and fulfilled a deep moral obligation.  |p224Claire  Weir had no particular fondness for country life , but she could not afford two large establishments . Rather than surrender the beautiful estate she had inherited from her husband , she contented herself with her small apartment in town and made Poundridge her principal place of residence . The Westchester County show place was an important element in the maintenance of her acquired social position , a matter of primary importance to her . In her more sanguine moments she found satisfaction in the reflectionthat she had done very well by herself  --  and with good reason . Born into a dull and undistinguished family , and reared in a small Ohio town , she had upon her graduation from high school taken a year 's course in a business school in Columbus and then come to New York in search of a wider life . Attractive , capable , and of an amiable disposition , she had no trouble in finding employment , shifting jobs whenever there was an opportunity for self-betterment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-paying job in the large cosmetics business of which Charles Weir was the head . Her ability ( and her looks ) rapidly brought her to her employer 's attention . She made good progress in the business and better progress in her personal relationship to him . Nearly thirty years her senior , he was still a handsome vigorous man . She was almost as keenly interested in the business as he , so they always had something to talk about when they were not otherwise occupied and they were never bored with each other . They behaved with great discretion , but complete secrecy was impossible . Charles Weir 's invalid wife and his two grown sons , who were in the business with him , knew very well how things stood . However , the wife had nothing to gain from a divorce or a scandal , and the sons thought it better not to bring the subject out into the open ; conse/quently Claire , who was conventional-minded and had occasional moral misgivings , was spared any outward embarrassment . She made many substantial contributions to the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch out into the manufactureand sale of theatrical make-up and launched a campaign of exploitationthat proved very successful . Part of her promotion plan was to obtain testimonials on the merits of the make-up ( which was no better and no worse than competing brands ) from theatrical celebrities , which brought her into contact with many famous theater people . She had always been stage-struck  --  indeed , she had thought at one time of becoming an actress  --  and this entree into the backstage world filled her with rapture . From time to time Charles Weir , at his brother Anthony 's suggestion , put money into theatrical productions . He never took these venturesvery seriously , looking upon them as a rich man 's diversion , like betting on the races or playing cards for high stakes . Several of these fliers had paid off well , and under Claire 's influence , he began to extendhis theatrical investments , with increasingly profitable results . She gave more and more of her time and attention to these activities , and , eventually , when Mrs. Weir died and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Claire to marry him , she gave up her position in the cosmetics business and devoted herself entirely to the financing of theatrical productions . She had come a long way from her small-town origins , and her new mode of life was far beyond her reasonable expectations . Not only was she married to a very wealthy man with important business and social connections , but she was actually becoming a prominent figure in the world of the theater . She had no interest in the drama as an art , regarding the theater solely as an institution for the amusement of the well-to-do and the pseudo-sophisticated . Her mind was commonplace , her ideas thoroughly conventional , so that her tastes were those of a large part of the playgoing public . If she liked a play the chances were that it contained the elements that made for popular success , and since she was careful to confine her financial support to the productions of well-established managers or in which actors dear to the public appeared , her percentage of correct guesses was remarkablyhigh . In consequence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she made a good thing of it . Her indulgent husband gave her a free hand , rewarding her with half his profits , without asking her to share his losses . She became much sought after , on the one handp226by producers who wanted her to hack their plays , and on the other by her husband 's business and social acquaintances who wanted an opportunity to participate in this pleasant form of money-making ( and , of course , to meet the stars who appeared in the plays ) . She was in the enviable position of picking and choosing among the scripts that were sent to her and of deciding which of her importunate friends she should let in on a good thing . It was all very exciting , and she had a thoroughly good time . Her husband had a good time too . Because of his first wife 's illness , he had for many years led a quiet life . Now he and Claire attended all the first nights and the parties that followed . They dined and supped at the glittering restaurants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social worlds , entertainedand were entertained at cocktails and at dinner , and got to know everybody in the theater who was of any importance . ' When Charles ' Weir died after nearly ten years of this amiable marriedlife , he left Claire well provided for . Besides her accumulated earnings from play investments , she had a large cash legacy , the valuableproperty at Poundridge , and a life interest in one-third of the profits of the cosmetics business . She had long ceased to take any active part in the business and was well content to leave its operation to Charles ' Weir 's two sons , who inherited it . She hardly ever saw her stepsons . There was no open enmity , but she thought them dull and stuffy and their wives even worse ; and they could never forget that she had been their father 's mistress and , what was more reprehensible , his employee . Beyond an exchange of Christmas cards and an occasionalchance meeting , they had little contact with each other . When business matters had to be discussed , Anthony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thompson when he was beginning to emerge as a producer . Quick to recognize his potential importance , she had offered to become one of his backers . She continued in this capacity until her husband 's death . Then she proposed a more formal arrangement with Thompson  --  in effect , a partnership . Financial details bored him and he was glad to have a partner who would relieve him of the necessity of raising money every time he produced a play . He insisted , however , that he should be the sole judge of what plays should be produced . Claire made no serious objection to this stipulation . She had great faith in his acumen ; in his record as a producer , the successes far outnumbered the failures . Shortly after they entered into this arrangement the death of Louisep227Henry put a sudden end to Thompson 's theatrical activities . It was more than a year before he resumed them . When he did , his relationship to Claire became more than a business one . He was desperately unhappy and in need of companionship , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides . With her money , social position , and good looks , she could easily have remarried , but Thompsonwas the only man who had ever stirred her emotions . She knew what Louise Henry had meant to him and that there could be no question of an immediate marriage . But her romantic feeling had outweighedher ever-present preoccupation with expediency and propriety , and she gave herself to him , regardless of conventions and of his instability . However , her objective had always been an eventual marriage . As the years went by and her lover continued to ignore her broad and recurrent hints , she felt that she must bring the issue out into the open and put it squarely before him . During the week that followed the meeting at Thompson 's office she saw little of him . They had several rather impersonal telephone conversations , and once she came to town to attend an opening with him . But they dined in a crowded restaurant and had supper with friends after the play , so that there was little opportunity for private talk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was awaiting an answer from May Weeks . To annoy Claire , he intimatedthat he was still considering Lily Prengle . He had heard the girl read and , though again impressed by her talent , had decided that she was too inexperienced to be entrusted with the part . On Saturday afternoon he telephoned Claire that he would like to come up for the weekend . Overjoyed , she insisted on sending the car in for him . She wished she had not invited Whitney and Merle Lofting . Lofting was second vice-president of a large insurance company and a frequent investor in Thompson 's productions . His wife was one of those undistinguished and indistinguishable products of an exclusivefinishing school , whose speech , appearance , and behavior are as standardized as those of the heroes of Western movies . The Loftings pounced upon Thompson , eager to learn his intentions about the play and to hear all the details of Emily Crandall 's extravagant conduct , to which more than one of the gossip columnists had made reference . He deftly evaded their questions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The talk at dinner was light and inconsequential . Afterwards they sat around drinking and listening to the radio and then played contract until bedtime.  |p228Thom|pson  always occupied the room , adjoining Claire 's , that had been her husband 's . The two rooms , each with its own bath and dressing-room , were in a separate wing of the spacious house . There was a connecting door , so that Claire and Thompson enjoyed unlimitedprivacy and intimacy while at the same time keeping up appearances  --  though , of course , the appearances deceived no one . He got into bed and idled through a bedside book , awaiting her inevitable arrival . Presently , she came in , handsome and seductive in blue silk pajamas . " Move over , darling , " she said . " No sex tonight . I just want to talk to you and be close to you . " She nestled against him , kissing and fondling him . " I 'm so glad to see you , darling . It 's been such ages . Only if I 'd known you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merle . And tomorrow there 'll be a whole mob , I 'm afraid . " " Well , I was n't sure I could get away until the minute I phoned you . Oh , by the way , Ginny Upton is getting back from Chicago tonight and is spending the weekend at the Mollisons ' , so I asked Hugh to bring her over tomorrow for a drink . Hope you do n't mind . " " Of course I do n't mind , " she said , trying to brush aside the unhappythought that this was the real reason for his unexpected arrival . " Only , I must say I do n't understand what goes on . " " Goes on where ? " " I mean with that girl and the Mollisons . How can she have the effrontery to go up there and spend a weekend under the same roof with Hugh 's wife ? And how can Cissie bring herself to put up with such a thing ? " " Maybe she figures she 'd never see Hugh at all if he could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd want to see him or go on being married to him . Believe me , I would n't stand for anything like that , not if I were twenty Catholics . " " Oh , well , they all seem to take it in their stride . It 's what the SalvationArmy people call a menage a trois . Very Continental and all that sort of thing . Anyhow , for all we know , Cissie may be making with the hay while  --  no , I 'd need Doc Winternitz to work that one out . " " That would make it just a little bit worse , " she said . " I think the whole thing is just disgusting . " " Get out of my bed ! " he said , pretending to push her out . " Stop being silly ! You know there 's no comparison . Anyhow  --  Oh ,  |p229well  , I guess it 's really none of my business , so I 'll just shut up about it . " " That 's the Christian way of looking at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if generally applied . " " Are you thinking about Ginny for The Clouded Mirror ? " " I do n't see any harm in talking to her about it . It 's either Ginny or Lily Prengle or nobody . " " Not Lily Prengle , for God 's sake ! " she said , unable to conceal her irritation at his constant harping upon the young actress , to whom , for no good reason , she had taken a violent dislike . " Well , then , it 's Ginny or we do n't do the show , " said Thompson , pleased by the effect he had produced . " Why ? Have you heard from May Weeks ? " " Yes , I got a wire this morning . " " Why did n't you tell me ? " " It 's the first chance I 've had . Anyhow , bad news is always better if it 's allowed to age a little . " " What did she say ? " " Oh , just that they 're talking to her about doing another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 's not sure that she 's right for the part . I 'm not sure that she is either . The whole thing was just a shot in the dark . " It was better not to tell her May Weeks thought the play gloomy and unpleasant  --  that would only supply Claire with additional ammunition . " Well , I 'm not sure about Ginny either , " said Claire . " What 's more , I do n't think she 'll want to do it . " " It never hurts to ask . " " And another thing , I do n't think Hugh will let her do it . He 's often told me he thinks she should play nothing but comedy . " " They 're not Siamese twins , for God 's sake ! Maybe she 'll use her own judgment . " " I do n't believe she 's got any judgment . If she had , she could n't behave the way she does . " " All right , let 's not go through that routine again . What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She sat up and clasped her knees . " I do n't know what to say . If we did n't have all that money tied up in it  --  ! But then why throw good money after bad ?

Helen finally had to break down and admit the truth , but she still swears she does n't know where he is . I think she does , but that he is n't in any fit condition to talk to anybody . " " Could be , " said Thompson indifferently . " Maybe Suzanne Merchantknows where he is . " " Who 's she ? Oh , you mean that girl that  --  " " Yes , the one that Tony sent around to me for the Lily Prengle part . " " Oh , so now it 's the Lily Prengle part ! I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's something to think about . " " Goodness , I wish we could find something to talk about besides Lily Prengle .

Unless we switch to Lily Prengle . " She gave him an angry look . " You 're strictly a one-gag man , are n't you ? " Then , appealingly , " Could n't you just try to be a little nice to me for a change ? " He fondled and kissed her . " I 'm sorry . I 've had a lot of things on my mind .

It seems to me you ought to understand that it 's not very nice for a woman to be in the position that I 'm in . " " Good God , are you going Victorian on me this late in the play ? " " That is n't it at all , and you know it ! " she said . " I 'm not prudish or conventional or any of those things . But I hate secrecy and pretending , especially when it 's so unnecessary .

You could make this your home , instead of being just a weekend guest . And for what we 're both paying in New York we could have a nice big apartment , for parties and all . And keep a cook , so that we would n't have to go running out all the time or eating half-cold food from downstairs . " " I do n't think I 'm the domestic type , " he said . " I tried it once , and look at the damn thing . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said indignantly . " You were anxious enough to marry Louise Henry .

Do n't you ever get the feeling that it might be nice just to settle down with one person for life ? " " In a word , no . " She sighed . " Honestly , I do n't understand men . If a woman really cares for somebody , why that 's all she wants or thinks of . But men do n't seem to be capable of any loyalty or any pride . Well , I suppose I could learn to put up even with that , if I had to , just as long as you did n't tell me about it .

Well , I never thought I 'd live to see the day when I 'd be begging a man to marry me  --  and have him turn me down besides . " It was useless to pursue the subject now . Her unfortunate reference to Louise Henry had closed his mind against any argument she could produce . " I think I 'll go down to the kitchen for a snack , " she said . " Ca n't I get you something  --  some cheese or a sandwich or a bottle of beer , maybe ? " " No , thanks , I 'm sleepy , " he said , yawning . " Good night , then . And sleep well . " She bent over and kissed him . He patted her head perfunctorily . " Good night , dear . Same to you . " After she left the room he put out the light , so that she would think him asleep when she came back from the kitchen . He lighted a cigar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now that Claire had broached the subject of marriage , she would never let it rest . He foresaw a series of long , tedious discussions . It was unlikely , though , that she would break with him , for he was important to her emotional life . What was much more probable was that she would drive him to the point of breaking with her . Of one thing he was completely sure : he would never allow himself to be talked into marrying her . He slept late , and by the time he put in an appearance the luncheon guests were already beginning to arrive . There were twelve at table , and after lunch more and more people kept dropping in  --  theatricalp233and literary personalities and a sprinkling of Claire 's prosperous neighbors , including several regular investors in Thompson 's productions . The balmy Indian summer weather drew them outdoors , where they scattered over the wide , well-kept grounds , the more active ones amusing themselves with croquet , tennis , and badminton , the others , Thompson among them , drinking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugh Mollison , in the actor 's new convertible . As they walked across the lawn Thompson went to meet them , his practiced eye taking in every detail of Virginia 's appearance . He was pleased by what he saw . She was no great beauty , but the impression she made was striking and vivid . Her thick , glossy golden-red hair , which she wore unbound , clustered in natural curls about her long , slender neck . Her skin was fair and delicate , her eyes a yellow-brown with golden flecks . She had a high , thin nose , a full mobile mouth , and square white teeth . Her figure was not particularlygood , for she was short-waisted and wide-hipped , but her hands were strong and beautiful , with long square fingers , her legs were straight and shapely , and she carried herself exquisitely . Her clothes were expensively simple and informal . Except for a small emerald ring she never wore any ornament . " Hello , men , " said Thompson , kissing Virginia and punching Mollisonin the ribs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Virginia . ( She always called Mollison " Huge . " ) " And so I am ! " roared Mollison , pounding his chest with both fists . Claire came over and greeted them with artificial cordiality . " I 'm so glad you were able to come ! But where 's Cissie ? " " She told me to say that she 's desolate , " said Mollison . " But seven or eight of her brothers arrived unexpectedly . Some of them I 'd never met before . " " Well , why did n't you bring them along ? " asked Claire vivaciously , trying hard to conceal her disapproval of Mollison 's open flaunting of his intimacy with Virginia , his desertion of his wife on his one full day home , and , most of all , his alcoholic breath . His drinking was a constant source of worry , for the continued success of Give Them All My Love depended entirely upon the star 's fitness to appear . They joined a group seated around an ambulatory bar , and Claire mixed highballs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation Thompson said , " Excuse me , folks , but I promised to take Ginny to the orangery and show her the snakes . "  | " Another drink like this , " said Virginia , " and I 'll be able to see them from right here . " Carrying their drinks , they went into the house . Thompson led the way to Claire 's little writing-room , where they would be undisturbed . " Is this where you compose your cocktail recipes , maestro ? " she asked , looking disapprovingly around the overdecorated room . She cordially disliked Claire and everything about her , not only because she resented the older woman 's attitude of moral superiority , but because she thought her vulgar and insensitive . " Yes , we call it the Stepney gas-chamber , in honor of Professor Moriarity . Tell me , if it 's not too personal a question , how the hell do you manage to look so beautiful ? " " It must be this new toothpaste I 'm using . It 's rich in rancid oils , yet costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though you 'd been doing a radio show . " " Grrrr ! Do n't speak of it ! " " I meant to listen in , " he said . " But I got tied up at the Stuyvesant . " " I 'd have busted you in the snout of you had . I do n't like people invading my privacy . " " I suppose you 've heard that I 've been having a little star trouble . " " My little delicatessen man did mention something about La Crandallgoing berserk on you . Is it true that she insisted upon having Louis-Jean design the padding for her cell ? " " It 's nothing to kid about , " said Thompson soberly . " She 's a patheticcase . " " I 'm sorry . I guess I must be developing an allergy to psychiatry ; but I 'm getting a little tired of people who set fire to day nurseries just because their mummies did n't love them . Personally , I always hated my mother and she returned the compliment , but that does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , maybe you 're right . But to hell with all that . What I want to talk to you about is playing that part for me . " " Oh , I see ! So that 's why you lured me in here ! " She had known all along that that was what he wanted to talk to her about . " You 're all alike , you men  --  always ready to take advantage of a young girl 's innocence . You 're not serious , are you ? " " Yes , darling . " " You must be going bats too . How do you figure me to step into Missy Crandall 's panties ? I 'm not worth a good five-cent cigar at the box-office. "  | " You know damned well you are . Anyhow , that 's not what interests me . I want an actress . " " There 's even some difference of opinion about that . " " Stop fishing , " he said . " Would I ask you to play the part if I did n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sorts of things out of sheer desperation . From what my spies tell me about the part , I 'm not the least bit right for it . I understand that she 's a hare-lipped girl who makes love to all her relatives , regardless of sex , and then finally mows them down with a tommy gun and serves them up in a pie . " " You 've been talking to somebody who read the expurgated version . As we do it , she uses poison gas , and wind machines blow it out into the audience . But for your private ear , it 's the best new play I 've read in two years and something you should n't pass up . " " I 'm supposed to be a comic , " she said . " When I come on people go Ha ! Ha ! ' and fall out of their seats . " " Well , this time they 'll go Boo-hoo ! ' and stay in their seats clappingwhen the curtain comes down . Where 's the law that says you always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwritten law , pardner , that says you should n't go out and make an idiot of yourself in public if you do n't have to . " " If I were n't sure you 'd score in this part , I would n't offer it to you . I 'm not anxious to make an idiot of myself either . I saw my doctoryesterday , and his diagnosis is that I 'm not in this business for my health . " " You should try Yoga . That 's that curdled milk stuff that does things to your intestines . I think I 'd better sit this one out , Tommy . " " You might at least read the script , before you decide . " " Oh , is there a script ? I thought maybe you made it up as you went along . You know , the Stanislaysky method . All right , I 'll read the script if it 'll make you happy . " " It will , because I think , when you 've read it , you 'll want to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you read it tonight ? " " Do n't high-pressure me , Thompson . Sure , I guess so . I 'll give Huge his bottle and sneak off and read it in bed . " " Nice girl ! " he said , patting her head . " Only I 'm not too happy about that bottle angle . He 's supposed to go on six nights a week , and Wednesday and Saturday matinees . " " He has n't fallen down on his face yet , has he ? All right , I 'll try to sober him up a little for you . "  | " And another thing . Do n't let him talk you out of doing that play . Use your own bean . That 's what it 's there for . " " Well , that clears up a long-unsolved mystery ! All right , professor , whatever you say . " She went out to rejoin the others . Thompson went to his room to get the script , which he put in the car for her . The guests were beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , he decided to go with them . He pleaded an early morning engagementto Claire as an excuse for not staying overnight . Claire was not the only one who found the relationship between Hugh Mollison and Virginia Upton a little shocking . What scandalizedpeople was their openness and indifference to public opinion . It was not a question of morals but of convention . Their irregularity would have been readily accepted , if they had taken the trouble to cloak it in the appropriate semblance of secrecy . But Virginia was too honest and Mollison too lethargic to play the elaborate game of false pretenses . They did as they pleased , careless of the disapproval of their more conservative acquaintances . They were an oddly assorted pair . Mollison , who came of a long line of well-known actors , had been on the stage since early childhood . He had had little formal education ; indeed , little education of any kind . He knew and cared almost nothing about the world outside the theater . He was charming , amiable , generous , and not without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , psychically insecure , and emotionallyimmature . Both in background and in character Virginia was almost his completeantithesis . Born in San Francisco , she was the descendant of a Forty-Niner who had struck it rich and laid the foundations of a con/siderable fortune . Her father , Phelps Upton , an overbred and overeducatedintrovert , without any particular ability or ambition , had set himself up as an investment counselor . He lacked both training and initiative , but he had the right connections . His social acquaintances gladly entrusted their money to him , on the theory that wealth breeds wealth , and that a man of his status must necessarily have the golden touch . His wife , a selfish , calculating woman , who had married him for his money and position , divided her time between sports and presidingover the great house in San Francisco and the country place on the Peninsula . Virginia , unwanted and unloved , was entrusted to governesses and tutors until she was old enough to be sent to boardingschool . Between her and her father there was a vague kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he did , he never quite knew what to say , and her instincts told her that he was not to be depended upon . Left to her own resources , she grew up self-willed , headstrong , proud , and fiercely independent . In her middle teens she was sent to a girls ' school in Lausanne , and the weak family tie was almost entirely dissolved . Europe was an eyeopeningadventure . She had aptitudes for all the arts , and the school encouraged her to develop them . She painted , wrote poetry , studied the piano , acted in the school plays . On the conducted holidays she attended performances at Salzburg , La Scala , the Comedie Francaie and the Old Vic , and became well acquainted with the treasures of the Louvre , the National Gallery , the Uffizi , the Pitti , and the Borghese . As her graduation approached she hesitated between studying painting in Paris and architecture in Rome . But Hitler 's march into Poland sent her scurrying back to the United States . Unwilling to live at home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Marylandin order to complete her college-entrance requirements . She had not been back long when a family catastrophe completely altered her life . A suspicious client of her father 's had inquired into Phelps Upton 's affairs and discovered gross misappropriations . Upton had not intended to defraud anyone , but he had taken to drawing upon the money entrusted to him , always with the intention of repayingit . When exposure came , he freely admitted his guilt , glad to be relieved of the burden of responsibility he had been carrying . Nobody took the trouble to inform Virginia of the scandal . She read it in the newspapers and went home immediately , feeling that she should make the gesture of standing by her father . He had thought it necessary to make the gesture of taking his own life , but , like every/thing else he had attempted , it was vague and unsuccessful ; the heavy dose of sleeping tablets had merely induced a violent attack of vomiting . He was faced with the prospect of a long prison term . But the district attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family a chance to make good the losses . By means of an enforced levy upon all the wealthy connections , the creditors were satisfied and the disgrace of having an Upton in a convict 's uniform was averted . The result was the complete disruption of the Upton household . Mrs. Upton promptly divorced her husband and married a moneyed Army officer , who had been stationed at the Presidio and was presentlytransferred to an important post in the Canal Zone . Upton , unable to face his former friends , went to live with his father , who had vast citrus-fruit interests in Southern California . Virginia , having made her gesture , returned to the East . She had only a small income from a family trust fund . Her grandfather had offered her an additional allowance , but preferring to be independent , she decided upon a stage career . For her , it was not too difficult to overcome the obstacles that beset the ordinary beginner . She used her social connections to obtain introductions to important producers , and they were impressed by her striking appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real talent for acting and considerable amateur experience , she quickly demonstrated her ability . Fortunately , too , the first play in which she appeared was a hit , and though her part was a small one , it ' enabled her to be seen by all the producersand directors . Her progress was not sensational , but steady , and she soon began to be known as a promising young actress . Then , yielding to an impulse , she answered a call for volunteers and joined a U.S.O. unit that was going out to tour the South Pacific battlefronts . The company was headed by Hugh Mollison , already well established as a star , who felt it his patriotic duty to help entertainthe fighting services . He and Virginia were strongly attracted to each other . Since they were constantly together , living in a perpetual state of excitement and tension , it was not surprising that a love relationshipdeveloped . It may have been their very unlikeness that gave them a piquant interest in each other . Unconsciously , too , she may have identified him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same sort of affableness , impracticality , and appealingly boyish irresponsibility . When the South Pacific tour ended Mollison returned to the Broadwaystage . Virginia was induced to make another tour , this time ofp239the home camps , in the course of which she had visited the camp where Eric had seen her perform . Upon her return to New York she rented a small , attractive apartment , so that she and Mollison could see each other freely . He could always find convenient excuses for remaining in town , so that he spent more time at Virginia 's than he did in New Canaan . But as she matured , she became increasingly conscious of his immaturity . Once the first rapture of physical passion had abated , she was no longer blind to his inability to stimulate her mind and kindle her imagination . On the afternoon following their visit to Claire 's , Virginia and Mollisondrove in to New York . They were having early dinner in town , to enable him to get to the Stuyvesant in plenty of time for the eveningperformance . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been drinking steadily over the weekend , was feeling the effects of it . Virginia was bored and irritable . She resented the casual wav in which the Mollisons accepted her as a member of their household and their assumption that she was as much interested in their domestic problems as they were . All through lunch she had sat silent while Mollison and Cecelia argued about their laundry troubles . He complainedabout the damage to his shirts and urged the advisability of engaging a laundress , while Cecelia enlarged upon the complications that would be created in the kitchen by the introduction of yet another person . The discussion went on interminably and with maddeningrepetitiousness , neither of them paying the slightest attention to Virginia . After lunch Mollison retired to the bar to read Eric 's play and stayed there until it was time to leave for New York . Meanwhile Virginia had to listen to Cecelia 's account of the difficulties she was having with her adopted children , who were now at the troublesome stage of early adolescence . Mollison had always found it easiest to humor them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , was too phlegmatic to exercise any real authority . Virginia , who thought them ill-mannered and insufferable brats , finally took refuge in the bathroom to escape the detailed description of their unreasonablebehavior . When Mollison appeared he said nothing about the play . He was waiting for Virginia to ask his opinion , as she usually did when she was offered a part . She was determined , however , that the initiative should come from him . So they drove along the Merritt Parkway in silence , until his reckless weaving through the traffic got on her nerves.  | " On Mondays you 're not supposed to go over a hundred and ten , " she said as they shot past another car on a curve . " Oh , am I going too fast ? Sorry ! " He slowed down from sixtyfiveto sixty . Then , after another five minutes of silence , " I read that play . " " Oh , is that what you were doing with it ? " " Tommy must have been kidding when he asked you to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing , " she said , " so I would n't know , I guess . " " In the first place , the play has n't got a chance . " " Tommy seems to think it has . " " The hell he does ! He saw it as a vehicle for Emily Crandall , and now that she 's out he 's stuck with it . " " Thanks , chum ! " " What do you mean by that ? " he said . " Good God , you 're not going sensitive on me just because I happen to say you have n't got Crandall 's draw ! Why , I have n't either for that matter . " " Come , come , do n't exaggerate ! And do n't you think it 's just a little dogmatic to say that the play has n't a chance ? How do you happen to know ? " " All anybody has to do is read it . " " I 've read it and like it . " " What , all that morbid , unhappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's damn well written , " she said . " And it 's about life . Did n't your mummy ever tell you about life ? That 's morbid and unhappy too . " " All the more reason nobody wants to see it in the theater . People pick their noses in real life too , but who 's going to pay four-eighty to see it on the stage ? " " I 'd just as soon see that as some of the little numbers I 've sat through recently . And I do n't subscribe to the theory that nothing goes but prat-falls . " " People go to the theater to be entertained and have a good time , not to listen to a lot of gloomy , tragic stuff . " " Alas , poor Ibsen ! " " All right , I 'll take you up on that , " he said . " When did Ibsen ever make a dime for anybody ? " " I was n't thinking about dimes when I read it . I was just thinking about what an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But not for you . " " Why not for me ? "  | " Because you 're a comedienne . " " A guy out in Des Moines once told me that I 'm an actress . But I guess maybe he was crocked . " " An actress who knows her business finds out what she can do and sticks to it . You 've built yourself up as a comedienne , and that 's what the public expects of you . So why not do the smart thing and cash in on it , instead of making a stab at something that 's not up your alley ? " " Or , to translate freely , you think I ca n't play the part . " She had her own doubts about playing it but resented his doubt . " I 'm not saying you ca n't play it  --  " he began , feeling he had been a little too blunt . She did not let him finish . " The part where she sleeps with a married man , I could play that good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What kind of a remark is that ? " " It 's the kind of a remark a girl makes when she begins to get fed up with being the family concubine . " " Jesus , you can dish it out , ca n't you ? " He swerved sharply back across the white line to avoid an oncoming car . " Look , " she said , " either let me drive or let me thumb my way back to town . " " All right , I 'll slow down . " They drove on in silence for a while . " What do you want me to do ? " " Maybe you could take me on as a laundress . I once played Little Eva , so I ought to get along fine with the plantation hands . " " Oh , so that 's what 's eating you ! I did n't know you expected us to put on a floor show for you . All right , from here on out we 'll talk strictly about James Joyce and grand opera . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kitty is old enough to wear lipstick . " " What 's wrong with a woman being interested in her children ? " he said . " Nothing in the world . Maybe that 's what 's the matter with me . Maybe I wish I had some to be interested in . Only I think I 'd prefer the homemade kind . It 's more work , but they taste better . " " That 's a dirty crack . We tried and could n't . If you ask me , I think Cissie 's been a pretty good sport about everything . " " Yes , I know . That 's the Claire Weir view of it . Otherwise known as the Westchester County gambit . But from where I sit she 's in a very cushy spot . Papa is n't around enough to interfere with her herbp242garden and gin rummy and Parent-Teacher Association . And meanwhileshe 's playing the understanding little woman to a fare-you-well , knowing damn well that if you conk out on her she 's got the house and the annuity and the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're always telling me you 're not interested in jewelry . " She shook her head . " If that 's an example of masculine logic , give me the old-fashioned nightshirt . " " She 'll never agree to a divorce , you know that . And I 'd feel like an awful heel trying to get one without any grounds . " " When did I ever say anything about divorce ? " " Then what do you want ? " " If I knew I 'd go out and get it . Only I 'm coming to the conclusion that what I do n't want is just sex in the afternoon . " Deeply troubled , he did not answer . It was not the first time she had expressed her dissatisfaction with their relationship , but she had never gone quite so far . What disturbed him most was that his marriagewas not the sole , or even the chief , reason for her discontent . He was intuitive enough to understand that she felt she had outgrown him . There was nothing he could do about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellect , he had relied upon his personal charm and bluff air of worldly wisdom to make up for his deficiencies . But the charm was fading and the wisdom was a pretense and he had nothing more to offer her ; whereas the growth and development in her had made her increasingly attractive . Though he sensed all this , he lacked the courage to face it squarely and accept it . Indeed , the prospect of losing her was something he could not even contemplate . He evaded the issue by telling himself that she was merely going through a phase of typically feminine instability ; if he just let mattersrest , they would eventually adjust themselves . They dined at Pinelli 's , where they were kept too busy chatting with acquaintances to continue their personal discussion . After dinnershe walked around to the Stuyvesant with him . He suggested that they meet at a bar after the performance , and she quickly agreed . She could see how she had hurt him and felt very penitent . Thompsonhad said that he would call her at nine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked slowly to her apartment in the East Sixties , brooding over what had happened and wishing that she had expressedherself with less bitterness.  |p243Eric  had had no further word from New York . Several times he was on the point of calling Irina Lanski , but he knew that if there had been any encouraging news he would have heard from her . On Tuesday , the day before the expiration of the ten-day period of grace , he was listening to a broadcast of a World 's Series game . This was the high point of his father 's year , even though the Red Sox were not involved . Eric felt rather guilty about idling , but he had done all he could in the way of job-hunting , and next day he was going to take the proofreading examination . Baseball was almost the only subject he could discuss with Kenwood without becoming involved in a bitter argument . While they were exchanging comments on the game the Western Union operator rang up . When she told Eric that she had a message for him from New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read it . It was from Leroy Thompson , notifying him that Virginia Upton had been engaged and rehearsals would be resumed next day at the Farow . Not trusting himself to believe that he had heard aright , Eric , with the receiver pressed close to one ear and his finger in the other , asked the operator to repeat the message . As he started for his room his father shouted , " Who was that ? " " A telegram from New York . We 've got a new actress for my play and rehearsals are starting again tomorrow . " Kenwood did not understand what he was saying , and Eric had to come close to him and yell into his ear . " Jesus Christ ! " screamed Kenwood angrily . " Are you starting with that again ? Why the hell do n't you go out and find yourself a job , instead of wasting your time with that goddam crap ? " Eric started to reply , but the game entered an exciting phase andp244Kenwood motioned him impatiently to silence . " Shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starve us all to death , go ahead ! " He leaned forward in his chair , shouting curses at the players . To get to rehearsal on time Eric had to be in New York that night , which meant getting the four o'clock bus to Hartford . While he was packing it occurred to him that if he left now , he would miss the examination . What he had already gone through warned him that he had better make what provision he could against another unpredictableaccident . He was eager to see Virginia Upton in action , but decidedhe could better afford to miss the first day 's rehearsal than forego the examination . When the ball game was over Eric sent Thompson a telegram , tellinghim that he would be delayed until Thursday . He smiled inwardly as he gave the operator the message , for he knew that the less of him the director saw at rehearsals , the better Thompson liked it . Then he called Great Barrington , anxious to know why he had received no reply from Sylvia . Muriel Davis , Sylvia 's hostess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eric since childhood . She had alwaysheartily disliked him , and her manner was cold and hostile . After a considerable interval she came back to the telephone and said that Sylvia was out and would not be back until late that night . Obviously she was lying . Eric hung up , worried by Sylvia 's unwillingness to talk to him . Next day , as Eric was leaving for Hartford , the postman arrived with a bulky letter from Sylvia . Eric put it in his pocket without opening it . He wanted to keep his mind as clear as possible for the examination . He checked his valise and sat in the station , reading the proofreader'smanual until it was time to walk around to the high-school auditoriumwhere the examination was being held . There were more than two hundred applicants , so that anyone 's chances seemed very slim . However , Eric had prepared himself carefully , and with his veteran 's priority his prospects were quite good . He hoped though that he would never be obliged to take the job . On the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was prepared for an evasively argumentative reply , even an outright refusal of his offer of marriage , but not for the virulent tirade with which she answered his warm and heartfelt missive . In language melodramatic to the point of hysteria , she accused him of bad faith , cruelty , irresponsibility , callousness , shiftlessness , and hypocrisy ; of keeping herp245dangling , using her or neglecting her as suited his convenience ; of frivolously throwing away economic security to follow a selfish whim ; of making a recluse of her and ruining her chances of meetingother men ; of deliberately postponing the question of marriage until he had nothing to offer her but a life of drudgery . She did not say , in so many words , that he had taken advantage of her virginal innocence only to betray her , but the implication was unmistakable . She did say that she thought him a waster and a coward ; that in her opinion he had no future as a writer ; that she would rather spend her life in solitude than marry him ; and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . This outburst of Sylvia 's was caused by a combination of circumstances , connected with her visit to the Davis household . From the moment of her arrival , Sylvia 's pleasure in seeing Muriel had been overshadowed by her envy of her friend 's happy situation . Muriel 's husband owned one of the largest automobile agencies in the Berkshires . With her lavish house , her garden , her servants , her cars , her New York clothes , her social set , to say nothing of her handsome , worldly husband and lively six-months-old son , she lived a life that was very unlike Sylvia 's own drab existence . Muriel 's prospects in Coltertown had not seemed much better than Sylvia 's , and still dazzled by her own good fortune , she lost no opportunity to show off her acquisitions . Sylvia , in a desperate effort to offer some competition , enlarged upon Eric 's happy prospects of success and her expected participation in it . She painted a glowing picture of Eric , as the author of a Broadway hit , establishing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostess to the celebrities of the theater . In fact , she would soon be going to New Haven to attend the tryout , and she intimatedthat she would see a good deal of Emily Crandall , who , she said ( carried away by her own fantasies ) , had told Eric that she was looking forward to the meeting . Muriel , impressed by Sylvia 's glamorous inventions , saw her friend in a new light . The shabby , frustrated , small-town girl , before whom she took such pleasure in preening , now appeared as the potential occupant of a Park Avenue apartment and the intimate of movie stars . That made even a sumptuous life in the Berkshires seem a little prosaic . Sylvia , pleased by the effect she was making , expatiated upon Emily Crandall'srather spectacular professional and marital life with the air of having obtained her information from some very private sourcesp246rather than , as was the case , from a careful study of the movie magazines . The first thing that clouded Sylvia 's dream world was the arrival of a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasizing the fact that he had waited until the day after his arrival to come around . When she came to her mother 's characterization of Eric as looking " like some filthy hobo , " she involuntarily glanced across the bright breakfast table at the well-tailored , well-barbered husband of her friend . And , a moment later , her fabricated structure collapsed when Muriel , looking up from the New York paper , exclaimedalmost jubilantly , " Well , listen to this , will you ? Emily Crandall 's had a nervous breakdown and she 's out of Eric 's show . " " Oh , that ca n't be true ! " said Sylvia desperately . Muriel handed her the newspaper . " Here it is , right in the paper ! And Eric did n't even take the trouble to let you know ? " Her friend 's tone told Sylvia that the aura had faded and that once again she was only the pathetic little school chum from Coltertown . " It probably just happened , " she said , fighting back the tears of anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . The papers always print all sorts of made-up stories , especially about celebri-ties . " So great was Sylvia 's humiliation that she was tempted to invent some excuse for going back home . But no excuse would have been plausible ; besides , she was too practical to rob herself of a luxurious vacation , even at the price of being patronized by her friend . Muriel , convinced that Eric was not a fit husband for any girl and intent upon making a suitable match for Sylvia , introduced her to Alden Greer , a business associate of her husband 's , and arranged for them to be together frequently . Greer was attracted by Sylvia 's prettiness and coyness ; Sylvia was flattered by Greer 's attentions and impressed by his glib patter , so unlike Eric 's fumbling inarticulateness . She began building a fine house of her own , on a hill overlooking the Davis place , and superior to it in many respects , thanks to her finer taste . This was her state of mind when Eric 's letter arrived . She read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of marriage struck her as a shameless attempt to enslave and victimize her . In contrast to the life of ease she had been envisioning , his suggestion of a union that entailed dreary discomforts and perpetual uncertainty seemed downright insulting and inexcusably selfish . He was trying to usep247her for his own ends , demanding that she sacrifice her whole lilc to his irresponsible whims . Muriel , finding her in tears and learning the cause of her distress , proceeded to aggravate Sylvia 's anger . She urged Sylvia to lose no time in breaking completely with someone so thoroughly incompetentand untrustworthy . This was exactly what Sylvia wanted to hear . Basically literalminded , she accepted the cliches of melodrama at their face value and saw herself romantically embodying virtue and righteousness , constantly menaced and victimized by the evil-hearted . In her world , there were only black and white , only guilt and innocence , and every situation had to have its villain and its hero . By the time she finished writing to Eric , she actually believed her own inventions . Fric read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live up to his ideals , he asked himself if Sylvia 's accusationswere justified , if he could really be the unprincipled scoundrel she portrayed . His objectivity and his sense of humor came to his defense . Sylvia 's case was completely vitiated by her gross distortionsand fantastic exaggerations . Temperate reproaches might have aroused his sympathy and made him feel guilty ; this diatribe merely disgusted him with her complete failure to evaluate the honesty of his letter . He had not wanted to return to the hotel where he had been so uncomfortable , but he was too upset to undergo the ordeal of trudging the streets for hours , so after being refused two or three times he went back to the old place . He was given an even stuffier and noisier room . Choked with emotion and impelled to strike back and hurt Sylvia , as she had hurt him , he sat for two hours , with a tablet on his knees , writing furiously , sarcastically refuting her charges and meeting her attack with calculated and searing ridicule . He went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next morning he reread what he had written , tore it into bits , and threw it into the waste basket . Then , afraid he might be tempted to read Sylvia 's letter again , he tore that up too . After all , it called for no answer : she said that she never wanted to hear from him again , and he would comply with her wishes . It was good to get back to the Farow . He walked briskly down the alley , opened the stage door with an air of easy familiarity , and shook hands cordially with the old doorman . The members of thep248cast asked solicitously about the damage to his home . McCarthy introduced him to the only stranger , Forrest Norman , who had been engaged to replace Richard Ismay . It was like a happy homecoming , and he had the warm feeling of being welcome among old friends . When Virginia Upton came in he went over to her with uncharacteristicboldness . " Hello , Miss Upton , I 'm Eric Kenwood . I was in Camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . " " Yes , so I understand , " said Virginia , quickly taking in his illfittingclothes , his shaggy hair , and his myopic eyes behind thick lenses , and deciding that she was going to like him . " You must have been slightly delirious or you never would have wanted me in your play on the basis of that exhibition . Leg all right now ? " She looked questioningly from one leg to the other . Eric laughed . " Oh , yes , it has been for years . I hardly remember which one it was . " She was even more attractive than he had remembered . The rehearsal was pervaded by an entirely new spirit . Instead of uneasiness and uncertainty , there was a general air of confidence and alertness . Virginia was not only quick to learn but anxious to make a good impression upon Thompson , Eric , and her fellow players . With her keen mind and her thorough understanding of her craft , she responded smoothly and creatively to Thompson 's directions . In two days she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased Eric even more was the justification of his belief in her rightness for the part . She read with sensitivity and a feeling for values ; already the character was adumbrated as the tragic figure Eric had conceived rather than the melodramatic one indicated by Emily 's more obvious approach to the part . When the company was dismissed for the day Eric summoned his courage again and went up to Virginia . " I think you 're going to be wonderful , " he said . She flushed with pleasure . " Are you sure your leg is all right ? " she asked with mock anxiety . " Yes , quite sure . And I 'm sure you 're all right too . You 're just the way I imagined the girl to be . " " Do you mind putting those words in writing ? Just so you have them handy to eat when you read my notices . " When she left the theater , Thompson , who had been talking to McCarthy , came over to Eric . " Well , you seem to like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be just right , do n't you ? " " She knows her business . And she 's got a quality . Only she 's so used to playing comedy that it 's going to be a job to get her to loosen up emotionally . But I think I can get her to do it . " " Well , I think she 's much better than Miss Crandall , " said Eric . " I hope the cash customers take your artistic view of it . However , we have n't got Emily Crandall , so let 's see where we can get with Ginny . " The resumption of rehearsals had entailed much more than the engagement of Virginia . There were a great many productions in preparation and it was not easy to get out-of-town bookings . Thompson wanted to revert to his original plan of opening in New Haven , but the town 's one theater was solidly booked until Christmas . Boston was heavily booked too , and it took all of Murray Fineman 's persuasiveness and Thompson 's prestige to get the hookingoffice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and less desirable theater two weeks later than the original date . That meant an over-all rehearsal period of six weeks . Equity , in view of the troubles with Emily Crandall , had agreed to an extra free week but had insisted that for the sixth week all members of the cast , except the newcomers , receive full salaries  --  a heavy and unforeseen expense . Furthermore , all the costume expenditure was wasted . Virginiadeclined to wear Emily 's half-finished clothes , on the reasonableground that neither the cut nor the colors suited her . She would have liked to have Louis-Jean design a new set of costumes for her , but she could not demand that and had to be content with a less expensive costumier . In the continued absence of Anthony Weir , Claire had to makep250the decision to hold the Farow Theater until The Clouded Mirror was ready to open . She could not do otherwise without antagonizing Thompson ; nevertheless , she was disturbed about the cost of keeping the theater dark for another two weeks , particularly since she had little hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Weir returned to his office a few days after rehearsals were resumed , he agreed that , in the circumstances , there was nothing else Claire could have done . He made no reference to his absence . She dared make none either , dependent upon his advice as she was , and a little afraid of him besides . Thompson usually stopped at his office on the way to rehearsals , to look at his mail and attend to other business matters , and several days after Weir 's return Murray Fineman came in , carrying some papers and obviously agitated . " Have you got a minute , Tommy ? " he asked . " What 's wrong now , Cassandra ? " " Well , I just got the theater contracts from Tony Weir . And he 's not giving us much of a break on the terms . I talked to him before he went off on that binge and we agreed on seventy-five per cent straight . Now , I get these contracts and  --  " " That was on the basis of Crandall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same deal with an actress that has no draw . " " Sure , I know that . But he 's cut us away down to sixty on the first fifteen thousand , sixty-five to twenty , and seventy- over that . " " The hell he has ! " said Thompson angrily . " Why , that 's no better than we 'd get from the booking office . " " Not a bit , " said Fineman . " And he 's cut us down on stagehands and advertising allowance too . And a sixteen thousand stop clause . " Thompson got up and walked around , fuming with rage . " The double-crossing old bastard ! Have you talked to him about it ? " " No , these just came in . Anyhow , I think this is something you 'd better handle yourself . I would n't be able to get to first base with him . He 's got us in a spot and he knows it . " " The son of a bitch ! All right , I 'll talk to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How much is our nut ? " he asked Fineman . " Well , I figure we can break on about fourteen . Maybe a little less once we get running and get our prop and electrical rentals paid off . " The telephone rang . " Hello , Tony , " said Thompson . " Say , I wonder if I could see you for a few minutes . "  | " Why , certainly , Tommy . Whenever you say . " " Well , how would it be if I carne right over ? " " Fine ! I 'll be waiting for you . " Thompson hung up and looked at his watch . " Call the Farow , will you , and tell Mack to take the rehearsal till I get there . " " Okay . Try to get at least sixty-five straight on the first fifteen and seventy straight if we go to twenty . And cut down that stop clause . " " This is going to be tough . What are the chances of getting another theater ? " Fineman looked worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , of course not ! We ca n't afford any more postponements . " " Well , that 's what I thought too . I 'm pretty sure there 's nothing open right now  --  nothing that you 'd want , that is . Anyhow , how would you square it with Claire ? " Thompson , who had been thinking of that too , did not answer . " Give me those contracts , " he said . He walked around to Weir 's office , trying to control the anger that the lawyer 's sharp business methods had aroused in him . The usual contract between a producing manager , like himself , and a theater owner , provided for a division of the gross weekly box-office receipts on a percentage basis , the major share going to the producer , since his expenses were far heavier than those of the operator of the theater . There was considerable latitude in the fixing of these percentages , the determining factors being the popularity of the principal actors , the prestige of the producer , the current demand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To the producer of a play that was only moderately popular , a difference of ten , or even of five , per cent in his share of the revenue might mean the difference between profit and loss and might seriously affect not only the play 's success but the value of the motion-picture and other subsidiary rights , which often depended upon the length of the play 's run . Consequently the terms of the theater contract were a matter of the greatest importance . Helen Jacoby , Weir 's secretary , averted her eyes as she told Thompson to go right into the lawyer 's private office . Her employer'speriodic alcoholic escapades were a source of grief for her . Whenever they occurred she could hardly bear to face his friends and clients . Weir and Thompson greeted each other with a cordiality neitherp252felt . The lawyer was as meticulously dressed and as self-possessed as always . Except for his leaden eyes and a slight huskiness in his voice , there was no outward evidence of his recent debauch . " Well , sonny , what 's on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jovialitywhich always infuriated Thompson . " It 's this Farow contract , " said Thompson , coming straight to the point . " Murray thinks you 're crowding us pretty hard on the terms , and I must say I agree with him . " Weir raised his eyebrows in mild surprise . " Do you , Tommy ? Well , I 'm sorry to hear that . Of course they 're not the terms we agreed on while Emily Crandall was still in the picture . But there we had a great box-office name and the practical certainty of capacitybusiness , for at least ten weeks anyhow . " " I understand that , " said Thompson , finding it hard to conceal his irritation . " Naturally I do n't expect the same terms now . But there 's still a hell of a spread between that and what you 're offering us . " " Well , I just assumed that under the present setup we 'd go along on the usual terms for a dramatic show . Is n't that what the contract provides for , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake is mine in thinking that I 'd get a little better break on the Farow than I would from the booking office . " " Well , that puts me in a rather awkward position , Tommy , " said Weir , assuming a frank man-to-man manner . " I need hardly tell you that both for personal and professional reasons I 'd like to give you every break I can . But I 'm acting here for the Farow Theater , that is to say , for Claire , who has the majority interest in it . She 's in pretty deep in this thing , much deeper than she anticipated , due , of course , to unfortunate and unforeseen circumstances over which none of us had any control . Now she has to keep the theater dark for another two weeks , and , of course , she 's perfectly willing to do so . But all that means that she 's got a long , hard row to hoe . In order to see daylight , she 's got to handle her bookings on a businesslikebasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come toan end . " She 's heavily in the show too . What difference does it maketo her whether she takes her profit on the theater or on the show ? " " That cuts both ways , my boy . You 're in on the theater too . " " How do you figure that ? I do n't own any stock in the theater . " " True . But you 're an officer and director . If the theater prospers ,  |p253we  'll pay substantial salaries before we declare a dividend on the stock  --  for tax purposes , if for no other reason . " " I 'm a little young to be thinking of an old age pension , " said Thompson . Weir ignored the sarcasm . " This is the way we have to look at it , " he said urbanely . " In spite of the community interests and all the personal considerations , the theater and the production are separateentities , and as I think I suggested to you before , the only way we can avoid a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let each enterprise stand on its own feet . This is not an unusual situation . People who are in business together often find themselves confronted with a conflict , or , let us say , a disparity of interests , and what they have to do is act as though there were no interrelationship . Let me give you an example . Suppose a corporation , in which I am a large stockholder , asks me to represent it in a law suit . Well , what I have to do is fix my fee in accordance with my usual scale , regardless of the effect upon the finances of the corporation and my own interest as a stockholder . Do you see what I mean ? " " Yes , I see what you mean all right . But what I do n't see is where it 's any advantage to me to go into the Farow if I do n't get a break in the terms . " Weir looked at him in mild surprise . " Well , I should say it 's the difference between being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all , you and Claire are closely associated in a continuing businessrelationship . " He put the faintest emphasis on " business . " " You just finished telling me that we have to forget that and act as though we were separate entities . I think entities was the word . " " Exactly , " said Weir . " As far as terms are concerned . But I do n't have to tell you that there 's more to show business , or any business for that matter , than just dollars and cents . In fact , I often think the personal element , the teamwork and the give and take , are more important than the money end of it . " " What about that stop clause ? " asked Thompson , weary of thismeaningless palaver . " Sixteen is pretty stiff , it seems to me . " " About normal , I should have said . What 's your nut ? " " Around fourteen , Murray figures . " " Well , the house could just about squeak by on that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terms stand , we might cutp254down the stop to fifteen and go a little further on stagehands and advertising allowance . I 'm sure Claire will do anything within reason to make you happy . Have you talked to her about this ? " " No , I have n't . " " Why do n't you ? After all , this is up to her . I 'm only acting in the capacity of an attorney , and whatever she says is what counts . My suggestion is that you go over the whole thing with her , and then just let me know what you agree upon . " " All right , I will , " said Thompson , rising . Weir rose and extended his hand . " We 'll work it out , my boy . The important thing is for everybody to be happy . After all , we pass this way only once , and if we do n't make the most of our human opportunities we 'll never have another chance . How is little Virginia Upton going to be ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm delighted to hear it . She 's a fine little actress in my opinion , but , of course , she has n't the following of Emily Crandall . Well , that ca n't be helped . What 's that old saying ? The best-laid plans of mice and men  --  " Thompson left Weir 's office , smarting under the consciousness of defeat . What made it hardest to bear was that it was his own fault . Behind the lawyer 's economic ruthlessness was his determination to revenge himself upon Thompson for the latter 's refusal to give Suzanne Merchant a part in the play . Not only had Weir looked upon it as a personal slight , but he had probably suffered a considerableloss of prestige in the girl 's estimation . Now that he was in a position to pay Thompson back , he was taking full advantage of it . At dinner that night , when he complained to Claire about the contract , she pretended that this was the first she had heard of it . She was not a very good actress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed by Weir of the morning 's conversation . More than that , Weir had strongly urged her to stand fast by her economic interests and not to be swayed by sentiment . Left to herself , she might have yielded to Thompson 's arguments ; fortified by Weir 's firmness , she evaded the issue and took the line that the contract was a mere formality , that between people as closely bound as they were , legal arrangements were not worth talking about . " Good heavens , Tommy , " she exclaimed , " anyone would think we 're strangers to each other , the way you go on about terms andp255clauses . We 're all mixed up in this together . What difference does it make what 's in some old contract ? You know that I 'm as much interested in the show as you are and that we 're both going to do whatever we can to make it a success . So why waste time trying to battle that legal mind of Tony 's ? Why not just sign the old thing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out the way we think best . " Thompson saw that further argument was useless and that he would simply have to depend upon his ability to influence Claire to modify the terms of the contract , if the situation demanded . So , next day , he instructed Fineman to sign the contracts , with the minor modifications to which Weir had agreed , and dismissed the matter from his mind . Eric was having a happy time , finding at last the aesthetic and mental stimulation of which his life in Coltertown had been so barren . As rehearsals progressed he began to grasp something of the essentials of acting and to understand the creative elements that went into the transference of a play from the typed page to the stage . Winternitz provided him with free seats for several plays that were not selling out , and though they were rather inept pieces he enjoyed the unaccustomed experience of theatergoing . Their very mediocrity threw into relief the excellence of his own cast and the directorial skill of Thompson . He no longer suffered from loneliness either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lily Prengle , or some of the other younger members of the company . Sometimes three or four of them would dine together . He learned of the backgrounds and struggles of his new friends , most of whom , like himself , had come from small communities and had had to fight their way into thep256professional theater . He was eager to become better acquainted with Virginia Upton , but he was afraid that if he asked her to go out she would invent some excuse or accept from mere politeness . Besides , her relationship to Hugh Mollison made him feel inexplicably self-conscious . His intellectual horizon widened too . One night Irina Lanski asked him to accompany her to a dinner party at the home of some friends . The host , a successful lawyer , had written some excellent verse , and his wife was the author of several quiet , sensitive novels . They lived near Washington Square in a pleasant old house where books and pictures were not merely ornaments but an integral part of the fabric . The others at dinner were an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a compatriot of Irina Lanski 's and an accomplished amateur pianist ; a well-known publisher ; and a woman anthropologist . The dinner was first-rate and tastefully served , and there was enough good wine to loosen everyone 's tongue . Eric had never been in such a house or met such people . Everyone but himself was widely traveled , and the talk roamed the globe , opening to him the possibility of a whole new range of experiences . Music and art and literature were discussed too ; and the unhappy state of the world and the pathetic struggle of the human race to rise above its baser instincts and to realize its inherent godliness . At first Eric was too awed to take part in the conversation , but the others unostentatiouslyput him at ease ; before long he found himself expressing thoughts and opinions which he was formulating clearly for the first time . After dinner the architect showed them some plans he had drawn for a model housing project . He spoke with deep feeling of a future society , in which squalor and ugliness would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house spacious and beautifullives . Then his wife sat down at the piano and played Chopin and Rubinstein and Debussy . At parting , Eric 's hosts wished him success and expressed a desire to see him again . He said heartily that he had never spent a more enjoyable evening . In the taxi he thanked Irina Lanski profusely for having brought him along . " Well , I 'll tell you the truth , " she said . " If I did n't now and then have an evening like this to wash my soul clean of the filth of Broadway , I would long ago have been in a strait jacket . "  |p257He  left her at her apartment house in the Forties , near the Fast River and walked the two miles to his hotel in a state of exhilaration , conscious that he had made a good impression and that Irina Lanski was pleased with him . Too stimulated to sleep , he lay awake half the night , thinking of the people he had met and of the things they had said , oblivious for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first run-through of The Clouded Mirror took place on the second Friday after the resumption of rehearsals . To a director of Thompson 's stature , this was an important milestone in the progress of a production , for it was his first opportunity to see the play as a whole , substantially as it would be presented to audiences . It was important to the actors too , for it offered them their first chance to give a sustained performance . Consequently everyone was keyed up and nervous , anxious for the outcome of this preliminary test of play , players , and direction . Ordinarily Thompson did not allow anyone to be present at rehearsals , but on this occasion he wanted a few spectators , to enablehim to judge the effect of the play upon those who were not too familiar with it . Claire , Winternitz , and Fineman were there as a matter of course ; he also invited Irina Lanski , Arthur Eckstein , the scenic designer , Samuel Rothberg , the company manager , Cleveland Dean , the house manager of the theater , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department , Felix Obermeyer , who was to do the publicity photographs , and Anthony Weir . He had been inclined not to ask Weir , but thought it impolitic to offend him further . Virginia 's theater maid , Pearl Dunlop , was also present , in order to familiarize herself with the sequence of scenes and to see how much time she would have for the numerous costume changes . Thompson had deliberately set the run-through for an hour when Hugh Mollison would be rehearsing a radio show , for he did not want the actor , at this stage of rehearsals , to make suggestions to Virginia that would conflict with his own conception of how the part should be played . Knowing that Thompson was a stickler for punctuality , everyone arrived a few minutes before the appointed time . Promptly at four o'clock he assembled the cast on the stage and addressed them briefly . " All right , children , " he said . " What we want to do today is see what we 've got . We 'll go right straight through , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between scenes for thep258stage managers to shift the props . And I do n't want to see anybody come on with a part in his hand . You 've all had time to learn it throw you a line . But do n't stop or go back . Just keep going as though it were a performance . And give it enough projection so that we can all hear it out there . I think that 's all I have to say . Oh , just one other thing , " he added , as though it were an afterthought . " If you show me a little something , I wo n't be too annoyed . " He came down into the auditorium and sat directly behind his secretary , who had a blank book and a tiny flashlight , ready to take his notes . " All right , Mack , " he said , " whenever you 're ready . " " Heads up , everybody ! " rasped McCarthy from his table behind the proscenium . " And watch that offstage talking . All right ! House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began , and there occurred one of those minor miracles that , to the people of the theater , are more than adequate compensation for all the uncertainties and disappointments , the anxieties and the heartbreaks , with which their lives are beset . Stimulated by the presence of even a handful of spectators and by Thompson 's broad hint that he expected something of them , the actors threw themselves into their parts with fervor and vitality . Without benefit of costumes or make-up , with no scenery , no furniture but kitchen chairs and rickety tables , no illumination but the single work light overhead , they imbued the play with vibrant life , creating an illusion of reality that made all the trappings of the stage a superfluity . It was a performance such as no lay audience ever sees . While it lacked the technical perfection of the finished product , it had the excitement of creativeness and the freshness of improvisation . The actors made a few mistakes and several of them required prompting , but these minor slips did not affect the over-all sweep and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first act Thompson jumped up and hurried down to the lounge to avoid hearing any comment until the performancewas over . Eric had sat forward in his seat , spellbound , as the characters he had imagined became flesh and blood . His heart was pounding by the time McCarthy shouted , " Curtain ! Five minutes , everybody , and do n't make it any more , " and he leaned back and looked at Irina Lanski , who sat beside him , wiping her eyes . " It 's good ! Very , very good ! " she said , squeezing his hand . " It should make you very happy . "  | " Yes , " said Eric , " it does . " It was the fruition of what had been germinating so long , the moment when , like the Maker of the universe , he looked upon what he had created and saw that it was good . He heard someone sniffling behind him . Turning his head , he saw Virginia 's maid blowing her nose . The middle-aged Negro woman was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unspokentribute . Claire came up the aisle . " Well , what do you think ? " she asked Irina Lanski , giving Eric a cold nod . " I think definitely yes . " " Tommy 's done a beautiful job , has n't he ? " " Yes , beautiful , " said the agent , kicking Eric 's foot . He was both piqued and amused by her giving Thompson all the credit . Yet he had to admit that the director deserved the praise . The insistence upon mechanical details , which had seemed so tediousto Eric , had resulted in a perfect coordination of words and action , so that the players moved through their laboriously rehearsed stage routine with the appearance of complete spontaneity and naturalness . Thompson reappeared and gave McCarthy the signal to begin the second act . It proceeded with the same verve and tempo as the first , building to a fine , stirring conclusion . When the last line was spoken the spectators burst into applause . The clapping of a dozen pairs of hands was a thin sound in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the actors it thundered like a mighty ovation . Thompson rose abruptly and turned to those who were seated behind him . " That 's the best goddam performance of that play that anybody will ever see , " he said , his face flushed with excitement . " If we run eleven years we 'll never top that . " Then , going down to the rail , he called , " Everybody on , please . " " Onstage , everybody ! " shouted McCarthy . The actors gathered in a group behind the footlight trough . " All right , kiddies , " said Thompson . " That was n't too bad . In fact , I 'm going to stick my neck out and say it was n't bad at all . I 've got a few notes  --  not more than a thousand or so  --  and we 'll check over them tomorrow at twelve . That 's all for today . You can all go out and get as drunk as you like , provided you take damn good care to stay sober . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased with the applause , and pleased with Thompson 's praise . Eric came quickly down the aisle , trembling with nervousness . " May I say a word , Tommy ? " he said in a choked voice . " Ladies and gentlemen , the author ! " said Thompson with a flourish . Eric cleared his throat . " Well , all I want to say is that I think you 're wonderful and I  --  well , I just want to say thanks , that 's all . " " And thank you for a beautiful play , " said Florence Fulham , and the other actors applauded . " Why , it 's turning into a love feast , " said Thompson , enchanted with everybody . As he started for the stage he encountered AnthonyWeir . " Well , that looks fine , Tommy , " said Weir . " You 've got a wonderfulcast . But I hope you wo n't mind one tiny little sugges-tion . " " Of course not , " said Thompson impatiently . " Well , it 's just that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act  --  I do n't know what her name is  --  to talk up a bit . I could hardly hear her , even in the fourth row . " " She 'll be all right . She was just a little nervous , that 's all . It 's the first part she 's ever played . " And then , afraid that he might lose his temper , " Excuse me , I 've got to talk to some of the people before they get away . " He went up on the stage , his jubilation somewhat marred by Weir 's thrust . It was true that Lily Prengle , in her inexperience and nervousness , had not projected her voice enough ; but Thompson knew that Weir was merely reminding him that he had not forgottenthe rejection of Suzanne Merchant . " What do you think , Murray ? " Claire asked Fineman . " Great ! Great ! A beautiful , artistic job . The only question is , will they buy it . " " Yes , that 's what I 'm worried about too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtful enough to congratulate Eric , among them Winternitz . " Eric , my bucko , " he said with a warm handshake , " it 's the first time I 've cried since I heard the news of Hoover 's election . " " Well , I hope that does n't mean we 're headed for another depression , " said Eric , laughing . He walked gaily up the alley . As he came through the gate hep261saw Virginia getting into a taxi . " Oh , Miss Upton ! " he called impulsively . She turned . " Well , if it is n't Ben Jonson ! " " Can I get in with you ? " " Please do . That is , if the driver does n't mind . " " It do n't cost no more for two than for one , " said the driver . " Yes , it 's sort of like marriage , is n't it ? Where are you headed for ? " " Nowhere in particular , " said Eric . " I just wanted to talk to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still on speaking terms . Pinelli 's , please , " she said to the driver . " I want to tell you again how wonderful I think you were . " " I hoped you were including me in that nice little curtain speech . Personally , I thought I stank , fluffing all over the place and going higher than a kite about a dozen times . " " I ca n't imagine anybody being any better . " He went on singing her praises with a fluency that was new to him . He was disappointed that the ride to Pinelli 's was so short . When they arrived he said , " I think I 'll get out here too . " Then , with another sudden impulse , " Are you having dinner with someone ? " " Not a soul in the world  --  unless the fleet 's in . " " Well , I used to be in the Army , " he said , " so maybe you 'll have dinner with me . " He trembled at his temerity , afraid that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slender purse too . But he wanted to celebrate and could have thought of no better way of doing it than by dining with her , in this famous Broadway restaurant , for twenty years the favorite eating-place of theatrical folk . " But with pleasure ! " she said . " I 've been mighty depressed about spending the evening alone with a mixed salad . " She usually dined with Mollison , but this evening he was busy with his radio rehearsal . Pinelli 's was jammed . About twenty people were waiting for tables , but Ricardo Pinelli , the proprietor , a small , thin man with a dyed mustache and a toupee , saw her enter and beckoned to her . " Right this way , Miss Upton , " he said . " I 've got your table all ready for you . " They pushed their way through the waiting crowd to one of the tables that he always reserved for his professional regular customers , compelling the laity , who came to gape , to wait its turn.  |p262Eric  looked around with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . The tables were close together , and the clientele was mostly theatrical . Virginia seemed to know everybody . As their table was on the central aisle , she was kept busy exchanging greetings with the passing procession of actors , directors , agents , authors , and columnists . Those who lingered for a moment she introduced to Eric . Some had familiar names , a few others he recognized as actors in Give Them All My Love or in other plays he had seen , most were unknown to him . He marveled at the extent of Virginia 's acquaintanceship . They had a cocktail and drank to each other and to the success of the play . " Are you up there ? " asked Eric , his eyes roving the walls , which were covered with framed caricatures by a Mexican artist . " I think you 'll find me between Edwin Booth and Rin-Tin-Tin , " she said . " I 'm afraid that does n't help me much . " She leaned forward and whispered . " The third row , second from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look now . " " Why , it looks nothing like you , " he said . " You have a little way with you , have n't you ? But if you 'd said anything else I 'd have bopped you . " After a second cocktail Virginia said she was getting hungry . The head waiter brought them the huge menus . Eric turned pale at the prices . While Virginia was ordering oysters , a steak , two vegetables , a salad , and a sweet , he looked in vain for something cheap . He could not sit there , eating a sandwich , while she went through a large dinner , so , stimulated by the run-through , the cocktails , the lively restaurant , and Virginia 's company , he cast away discretion and matched her order . They kept up an animated conversation and in spite of frequent interruptions learned a great deal about each other 's backgrounds . Eric was dazzled by the extent of Virginia 's travels and the variety of her experiences . It would have surprised him to know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and close family relationships . After dinner she ordered a brandy and then another . It was nine o'clock before they were ready to go . The check with the tip came to over fifteen dollars  --  a whole week 's food allowance gone for one meal . " Do you want a taxi ? " he asked as they left the restaurant . " I think I 'll walk home , " said Virginia.  | " Would you let me walk with you ? " " Well , if you can stand any more of me . Only do n't do it just because you think I need protection . " " No , you look as though you 're able to take care of yourself . " " I 'm not sure whether I like that or not . As a matter of fact , when I first came to New York I was prepared to defend my honor at every street corner . But in all the years I 've been here no one has ever accosted me except a few old ladies who wanted to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't believe that . " " Where I come from , no gentleman calls a lady a liar . He just takes it for granted that she is . " Eric laughed . " When I first came to New York I was scared to death of everything and everybody . I still am , in a way , but it 's beginning to wear off a little . Did you feel the same way ? " " Not exactly . New York just seemed to me to be a bigger , noisier , and uglier San Francisco . But I know what you mean . And a good way to get over it is always to keep in mind that nine-tenths of the people you meet are as scared of you as you are of them . " " Thanks . I never thought of that . It may help . " When they reached her door Virginia asked him up for a drink . She lived in a house that had been converted from a private residenceinto small apartments . Hers consisted of a large living-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen , and another small room , intended as a dining-room but which she had made into a spare bedroom , as she almost never ate in . To Eric , the charmingly furnished apartment seemed quite luxurious and elegant , but for her , it was a very modest place indeed , after the great houses to which she had been accustomed . While she mixed highballs Eric looked at the paintings with which the walls were hung . There were several originals by Klee , Miro , and Picabia and good reproductions of Braque , Picasso , and Rouault . Eric , who was beginning to appreciate Cezanne , Degas , and Manet , was puzzled by these works of the twentieth-century abstractionists and surrealists . He asked Virginia to explain to him what she saw in them , and she launched into a disjointed but eloquentdiscourse on non-representational art , trying to make him see that he was making the mistake of looking at painting from a literary point of view , instead of thinking of it in terms of its plastic elements of form , design , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproduce his subjective response to his material rather than its external reality . Eric listened with interest , not fully graspingher argument but beginning to understand that modern paintingwas influenced by the same principles that underlay much of the modern literature he had read . Indeed , his own play to some extent reflected these tendencies . From painting they went on to poetry , in which they were both widely read . Virginia was particularly fond of the late Victorians  --  Browning , Swinburne , Matthew Arnold , and Francis Thompson  --  and had committed long passages to memory . She replenished the highball glasses , then put on some records of de Falla , Albeniz , and Granados , none of whom Eric had heard of . They were both enjoyingthemselves thoroughly . Virginia , however , was relieved when Eric said he thought it was time for him to go . She did not particularly want him to meet Mollison there . Just as Eric was saying good night a key turned in the door of the apartment . Virginia bit her lip in vexation . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latch key only when she was out , but he frequently forgot . " Hi , Ginny ! " Mollison shouted . He burst into the living-room , then stopped short as he saw Eric . " Why , if it is n't Huge himself ! " said Virginia with affected casualness . " This is Eric Kenwood , who wrote all those words I ca n't seem to remember . Eric , Mr. Huge Mollison , star of stage and rodeo . " " Mr. Kenwood , it 's a pleasure , " said Mollison , pumping Eric 's hand with excessive heartiness . " Ginny , you left your keys in the door . " He put his own bunch of keys on the marble mantlepiece . " No , not again ! " said Virginia , forced to play up to his transparent fiction . " Some people never seem to learn . " Sure that Eric had seen her put her own keys back into her handbag , she inwardly cursed Mollison for making matters worse with his clumsy subterfuge . " Sorry I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How did it go ? " He went to the cellarette and mixed himself a drink . Eric did not fail to note how completely at home he was . " Well , the author attempted suicide but failed , " said Virginia , trying desperately to make the best of the situation . " So maybe that 's a good sign . " Eric 's frozen silence was painfully evident . She was annoyed at him , too , for not showing a little more social grace.  | " Sounds to me like a hit , " said Mollison . " Mr. Kenwood , can I assemble a drink for you ? " " No , thanks , I was just leaving . " " Wo n't you have one little one for the road ? " asked Virginia . " No , I really ca n't . I  --  I have to write some letters before I go to bed . " She made no further effort to detain him . He was feeling slightly ill . When he got downstairs he stood for a few moments on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did not have Virginia 's capacity for alcohol , and his head was reeling . The joyous day had come to a miserable end . The dazzled delight with which he had regarded Virginia gave way to a feeling that was almost hatred . It was wholly irrational , for her relationship to Mollison was a matter of common knowledge and she was not to blame for the actor 's bungling entrance . But the sudden and brutal visualization of their intimacy shocked Eric 's sensibilities and belied his idealizationof her . The next morning Virginia , usually very prompt , was fifteen minutes late at rehearsal , purposely delaying her arrival in order to avoid conversation with Eric . She bustled in , profusely apologetic , and slipped into a chair among the other actors . Thompson began to go over the typed-up notes he had made at the run-through . Eric was again amazed by the acuteness of his observation and the sensitivity of his perception . Thompson had noted every minute defect , every false intonation and gesture , every slurred line and overlong pause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had finished with the actors he turned the rehearsal over to McCarthy and went down to the lounge with Eric . Most of the proposed changes were of a minor nature , and Eric readily agreed to make them . Several , however , entailed a good deal of rewriting . Eric demurred a little but finally gave in . Since their first meeting his respect for Thompson 's judgment had increasedenormously . He was glad to be kept busy , for it would have been painful to sit all day watching Virginia , with the memory of last night still so vivid . Since it was impossible for him to concentrate in his room , he went to the main reading-room of the Library , and with a few books propped up before him to give the appearance of research , worked away at the revisions until closing time . On Sundayafternoon , when he finished , he called Thompson at his hotel.  |p266The  director invited him to supper in his suite , and they spent the evening going over the revisions , arguing about the use of words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this or that speech , until they reached an agreement on all the disputed points . Again Eric was struck by the contrast between his own dismal cubicle and the roomy , attractive quarters of his new friends . He had no craving for luxury , but he was sensitive to his surroundings and wished he could afford to live tastefully and with a certain degree of comfort . He contrasted , too , what life would be like with Sylvia , on the one hand , and with Virginia , on the other , but dismissedthese speculations as wholly idle . Two weeks remained before the departure of the company for Boston . Thompson , working like a sculptor , devoted this period to giving his production its final form . The solid mass had been hewn into shape , its balance and design had been tested ; what remainedwas the pointing up , the refinement of detail , the delicate and laborious polishing of the surface . With the unwearying patienceof a perfectionist , he went over and over the play , scene by scene and line by line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost musicianly ear for timing and phrasing ; he knew exactly where the values were and where the emphases should fall and , to a split second , how long a pause would hold . His influence upon the actors was almost mesmeric . They responded to his touch like the strings of a perfectly tuned instrument . Sometimes , indulging his irrepressible yearning to act , he got up on the stage and assumed this role or that , demonstrating how he wanted it played , while the displaced actor stood aside and watched . He never knew the lines , but he had the knack of improvising in ap267way that conveyed accurately the sense of the scene ; his intentional exaggerations served as vivid illustrations of the quality he wanted from the actor . This concentrated activity consumed only a part of the rehearsal time . When each new point had been made , it had to be repeated , over and over , until the actors had thoroughly assimilated it . Duringthese necessary but boring repetitions Thompson left the stage , sometimes retiring to the lounge to smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the long divans , sometimes roaming aimlessly around the dark , empty theater . Claire dropped in for an hour occasionally , or one of his staff would come in to consult him about some business or technical detail . Usually there was no one in the auditorium except his secretary and Eric . The only other exception was Lily Prengle . Thompson had made her Virginia 's understudy , partly to soften her disappointment at not getting the role , partly because he thought her capable of going on , in the event of Virginia 's indisposition . The public would not have accepted a substitute for Emily Crandall , but it was quite feasible to make a temporary replacement for an actress of Virginia'slesser eminence . Since Lily had only one scene of her own , she had asked permission to watch the rehearsals from the auditorium when she was not needed on the stage . Thompson did not like to have actors sitting out front and seldom permitted it , but Lily had very sensibly pointed out that she could get a much better understandingof the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had finally consented , warning her , however , to make herself as unobtrusive as possible . So she would slip through the pass-door and steal quietly up the side aisle . In his peregrinationshe would see her dark silhouette as she stood motionless at the back or sat in some side seat . Actually it was a relief not to have her on the stage . He was beginning to get a little tired of her silent adoration . Every time he looked in her direction he could see the undisguised worship in her large , pale blue eyes . He was quite accustomed to having the women in his companies fall in love with him  --  a psychiatrist friend had once explained that it was a form of father fixation  --  and not infrequently he availed himself of their emotional receptiveness . But he found Lily 's mooning , humorless , adolescent homage something of an annoyance  --  especially since he was not particularly attracted to her . The hours he spent in the dark auditorium always aroused in  |p268him  a strange excitement . He roved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prey prowling the midnight jungle of which he was undisputed king . He would creep stealthily up the carpeted stairs to the balcony and then up the steeper stone steps that led to the gallery . Here the proscenium arch cut off the rehearsal light , and as he went down the sharp gradations of the gallery aisles he had to proceed with extreme caution . A misstep might mean a broken limb or a fractured skull . He seldom used the small flashlight he carried hooked on to his breast pocket like a fountain-pen , preferring to feel his way through the darkness . As he moved around he could hear the lines spoken on the stage , and the actors were often startled as he boomed directions from an upperbox or the gallery rail . Sometimes he even climbed up to the big rehearsal room and peered out through the peephole from which Oscar Farow had spied upon him so many years ago . From that great height he watched the foreshortened and diminutive actors with the satisfaction of a puppeteer who sees his dolls respond with great precision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rehearsal period he was awakened at six o'clock by the ringing of the telephone . He fumbled sleepily for his bedside lamp and picked up the receiver . " Hello , Tommy , this is Isabel . " Before he could lash out at her for calling him at such an hour , she went on in a voice full of anxiety , " I thought I 'd better let you know that Doris is in a critical condition . " Instantly Thompson was wide awake . " What is it ? " he said in great alarm . " She woke up about an hour ago screaming with pains in her abdomen . Doctor Wolfe is here and he says it 's an acute appendix . We 're rushing her to the Metropolitan Hospital just as fast as we can . " She was weeping now . " If we can only get her into the operating-room before it ruptures ! " " Have you got a good surgeon ? " " Doctor Simmons . Doctor Wolfe says he 's the best . " " Maybe I 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wo n't do any good . I 'll call you when the operation is over . Only this is going to be a terrrible expense , Tommy , and I ca n't  --  " " To hell with that ! " said Thompson angrily . " Just see that she has the best of everything and send the bills to me. "  | " I do n't know what I 'll do if anything should  --  " sobbed Isabel . " Wait , there 's the doorbell . That must be the ambulance now . Good-by . I 'll call you later . " Unable to go back to sleep , he pulled up the shades , bathed , shaved , and made himself some coffee . Then he tried to read , but he could not put his mind to it . He sat with the book open on his knees , smoking one cigarette after another , and drinking brandy to fortify himself . Since his divorce he had seen less and less of his daughter . It had been part of his agreement with Isabel that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but she was usually away for the summer and sometimes he was off on a businesstrip or a vacation , so that actually he saw her only five or six times a year . On their days together he would take her to lunch and then to a movie or the circus , striving to find ways to please her and using all his charm in an effort to recapture the affection she had had for him before the divorce . On Christmas and her birthdayhe sent her lavish gifts , and every now and then he would write her a little note or send her a box of sweets . But she was , of course , completely under her mother 's influence , and he could not combat Isabel 's systematic campaign of alienation . Each time he was with the child he was more conscious of the growing estrangement . It saddened him , for she was one of the few people he had ever loved . Always afraid of pain , he had rationalized his grief into an attitude of cynical indifference . Now that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his love for her came back with a rush . He remembered the feel of her little arms about his neck and her babyish delight in his pranks and foolery . The thought that she might die without his seeing her again was unendurable . He had an impulse to rush to the hospital , but she would be in the operating-room by the time he got there . He threshed about the room , looking at his watch every five minutes , finally picking up a magazine , which he systematicallycut into ribbons with a paperknife . Shortly after nine the telephone rang and he leaped to answer . It was Isabel . " Well ? " he asked breathlessly . " Thank God everything is all right . We got her here just in the nick of time . The thing burst when they started to remove it , but they were able to clean it all out . If it had happened any sooner it might have gone into peritonitis . Oh , God , what I 've been through since five o'clock ! " " How is she now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the anesthetic . The doctor says she may be uncomfortable for a few days , but there 's no danger . " " Can I come around to see her ? " " Just a minute ; I 'll ask Doctor Simmons . He 's right here . " There was a brief pause . " He says if you want to step in around twelve it will be all right . But only for a few minutes . " " Okay . I 'll be there . " On his way to the hospital he stopped at a toy shop and bought a large china doll in an exquisite hand-sewn silk dress . He tapped lightly on the door of Doris 's room . After a moment a nurse opened it softly . " I 'm Doris 's father , " he said with the inevitable flash of anger as the nurse 's eyes involuntarily went to his disfigured face . " Oh yes . Come in . " " Hello , Tommy , " said Isabel , assuming the madonna-like air that was appropriate to the occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's coming along fine , " said the nurse . Thompson tiptoed over to the bed . Doris was lying on her back , her eyes closed , breathing rather heavily . As he looked down at the flushed face and the twitching lips a swift rush of love and pity went through him . " She 's not asleep . You can talk to her , " said the nurse . Thompson bent over her . " Hello , sweetheart , " he said tenderly . " How 's the old pain in the neck ? " The child opened her eyes , looked up at him , and closed them again without answering . Thompson removed the wrappings from the doll . " Oh , is n't that beautiful ! " said the nurse . " Look what your daddy brought you , honey . " Again the child opened and closed her eyes . " Just a little girl friend to keep you company , " said Thompson . " She 's not feeling so well either , so I guess we 'll put her right into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pillow beside her . Doris opened her eyes and turned her head slightly . Then she gave the doll a violent shove . It fell to the floor , the head cracking on the cement . " Get out of here ! " said the child hysterically . " I hate you and I hate your ugly face . " " Why , Doris ! " exclaimed Isabel . " Oh , dear , what a shame ! " said the nurse , picking up the doll and examining the damaged head ruefully.  |p271The  port-wine stain had turned a deep purple . " I guess I 've worn out my welcome , " said Thompson . " I 'm terribly sorry , Tommy , " said Isabel . " The poor child does n't know what she 's saying . I 'm sure if she did  --  " Thompson cut her short . " Let me know how she 's getting along , will you ? " " Yes , of course I will . " He emptied his brandy flask in the taxi and stopped on his way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company through the second act . Telling them to go right on , Thompson went down the steps and walked up the aisle . Lily Prengle was standing at the back , behind the last row of seats , leaning her arms on the half-partition . Thompson nodded to her , walked around to the other aisle , and took a seat halfway down . He tried to concentrate on the rehearsal , but he could not shut out the memory of the detestation in his daughter 's voice , the gleam of triumph in Isabel 's eyes , and the nurse 's clumsy embarrassment . He reached for the brandy bottle and swallowed a huge mouthful . Unable to sit still , he got up and walked up the aisle again . As he saw Lily standing there immobile , her eyes glued to the stage , he had a sudden vivid image of Emily Crandall slapping the girl 's face and screaming insults at her . Lily , too , had known humiliationand hurt , and recalling how she had clung to him afterwards and the feel of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinship for her and a desire to seek some assuagement of his pain . He walked over toward her . She knew he was there but gave no indication of it . He stepped softly behind her and , circling her with his arms , cupped her unbound breasts in his hands , pressing his blemishedcheek against hers . He could feel the pounding of her heart and the tensing of her muscles . He held her closer against him , thinking irrelevantly that with her long-lashed blue eyes and silken yellow hair she was not unlike a doll . " Half a moment , dear , " said Reginald Olmsted to Virginia , with whom he was playing a scene . Stepping down to the footlights , he peered out into the darkness . " I say , Tommy , are you there ? " " Always at your service , " said Thompson , leaving Lily instantly and walking down the aisle . " Something troubling you ? " " Well , I do n't want to be a bother , but it 's just that I feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varieties of slut she is , is just a little too much of a muchness , even for a loving father . I always feel I should play it with my fangs dripping blood . "  | " Good ! " said Thompson . " Mack , get Mr. Olmsted a set of fangs and a pint of blood . " The actors laughed . " Yes , sir , " said McCarthy . " What size fangs do you take , Reggie ? " " No , but seriously , old boy , " said Olmsted . " Do n't you think it could be toned down a bit . I do n't mind being a wolf , but , somehow , I do n't quite fancy myself as a werewolf . " " How about it , Eric ? " said Thompson . " Do you think you can get the were out of the werewolf ? " " Yes , I guess I could tone it down a bit , " said Eric . " Well , go to it , will you ? " " Thanks awfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eric went up to one of the dressing-rooms to work over the speech , and the rehearsal was resumed . Thompson sat down and took another long drink . It had been a strain for him to keep up his customary badinage . The alcohol was beginning to mount to his brain , and he got up to go to the lounge . Lily had disappeared . In the lounge he noticed a light shining through the transom of the women 's room and came to the conclusion that Lily must be in there . Claire was in the country and his secretary was at home with a cold . So it must be Lily . A strict rule forbade the members of the cast to use the toilet facilities at the front of the house , but a novice would probably not be familiar with this regulation . He started for the men 's room , then stopped and strode over to the women 's room , pushed open the door , and entered the anteroom , which was furnished with several dressing tables , full-length mirrors , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and stood lookingaround uncertainly . Behind the latticed swinging doors he could hear Lily clearing her throat and the sound of water spurting into a wash basin . Then he heard the rip of a paper towel , pulled from the container , and the crumpling of it as she dried her hands . Presently the door swung open and she came out . She stopped short with a gasp of amazement , terror in her eyes . Staring fixedly at her , he took a swift step backward , groped behind him for the wall switch , and turned out the lights . " Oh , no , no ! Please ! Please ! " cried Lily as he came toward her in the darkness . His arms went around her and his mouth smothered her outcry . When Thompson returned to the auditorium Eric was waiting for him on the stage with the revised speech . They went over it withp273Olmsted , who still offered a few objections . After some discussion it was put into a form that satisfied everybody . While they were talkingThompson saw Lily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his direction , she went swiftly to a far corner , sat down , and turned the pages of her understudy part . It was now almost half-past three . Thompson halted the rehearsal for the usual midafternoon interval . The instant he gave the signal for dismissal , Lily got up , without a word or a glance , and was the first one out through the stage door . Thompson 's temples were throbbing and his eyes were heavy from lack of sleep . He wanted to leave the rehearsal to McCarthy and go to bed . Unfortunately he had scheduled a run-through for four o'clock and had invited Mollison , unable to evade any longer the actor'sinsistence . It would be rude of him to absent himself ; besides , he was worried about what Mollison might say to Virginia about her performance if he were not there . So he went to the lounge and lay down , dog-tired and headachy and furious at himself for his lack of self-control . He had no feeling of guilt . Lily was old enough to know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man unless she wanted to . Indeed , she had incited him with her fatuous , unconcealed adoration . What angered him was his folly in getting himself involved with this half-baked little actress , in whom he had no interest and who was obviously not the sort who could surrender to a quick impulseand then as quickly forget about it . Her romantic , febrile nature would undoubtedly endow it with the dimensions of a grand passion . He foresaw that she would be a problem . With the heaviest part of his work still ahead of him  --  the dress rehearsal , the tryout , the preparations for the New York opening  --  he did not want to have her hanging around his neck , or , in fact , anywhere near him . It occurred to him that the simplest way of disposing of her would be to give her her notice , pay her the required two weeks ' salary , and be done with her , once and for all . He would not even have to take her to Boston . It would be easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two days , and to find another understudy for Virginia . With grim humor he contemplated engaging Suzanne Merchant . That would make AnthonyWeir happy and might turn out to be a good stroke of business . But even while he was weighing it he knew he would not do it . He could be brutal on occasion , but not to someone as ineffectual and as defenseless as Lily . She was no challenge to him in any sense , and his self-esteem would not permit him to use his power against one so help/less . Nor could he bring himself to rob her of the professional opportunityhe had so generously given her and of which she had proved herself so worthy . No , there was nothing to do but to accept the situationand find a way to wriggle out of it . With this bitter reflection he fell into a troubled sleep , from which McCarthy apologetically awakened him at four-fifteen . The run-through was listless and pedestrian . The company was going through the period of lethargy that usually precedes the final tuning up . Besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them self-conscious to perform under the critical eye of an actor of his importance . That was particularly true of Virginia , who always set great store by his judgment of her performance . Though she had accepted this part largely as an assertion of her independence of him , she was afraid of his criticism . She found it impossible to surrender herself and merely walked mechanically through the part . The other actors took her mood , and the result was a dull and uninspired exhibition . As for Lily , she did little more than repeat her lines automatically , hardly knowing what she was saying or doing . Thompson sat inattentively through the performance , too indifferent to make notes . The moment it was over he dismissed the company without a word of comment . The final days of rehearsal were trying ones for Virginia , crowded with shopping and packing and tiring costume fittings and then the costume parade , always an ordeal . The clothes never seemed to turn out right , and there were heated discussions and hurried last-minute alterations . Claire 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite ideas about clothes , which she did not hesitate to express . Virginia resisted her every suggestion , and there were lost tempers ,  |p275shar|p  words , and tears . It took all Thompson 's diplomacy and authorityto prevent a serious quarrel . Worst of all was Mollison 's meddling . Thompson 's fears of the actor'sinfluence upon Virginia had been more than justified . The ragged run-through had confirmed Mollison 's dislike of the play and his conviction that she was unsuited to the part . All through rehearsals she had felt very happy and very sure of herself ; now she was so discouragedby Mollison 's antipathy to the play and his caustic criticism of her performance that she actually asked Thompson to release her . His reassurances , together with those of Eric , Olmsted , and Florence Fulham , finally persuaded her to go on , but did not succeed in fully restoringher confidence . She approached the Boston opening with even more than the usual uneasiness . Added to her other difficulties was the problem of Mollison himself . Though she had superficially patched up her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waverings , come to the conclusion that she must terminate their intimate relationship . The meaning had gone out of it for her ; it seemed senseless to go on with it . ( There was another deeper reason for her decision , but she was not yet ready to admit it even to herself . ) But it was one thing to decide to break with Mollison and another to put her decision into effect . His feelings for her were unchanged  --  if anything , he was more dependent upon her than ever  --  and she could not bring herself to tell him bluntly she was through with him . That would be too severe a shock to his emotions , too crushing a blow to his pride . Of late he had accused her more and more of thinking herselfsuperior to him , and a curt dismissal would be a humiliating confirmation of his misgivings . ( That she really did feel superior merely made matters worse . ) To spare him a sudden , cruel blow and herself the degradation of a sordid quarrel , she decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extrication , so that when the break finally came it would be made easier by long preparation . The first logical step in this campaignwas to make it more difficult for them to he together . However , as long as Mollison had free access to her apartment there was no keeping him away . In fact , her chief reason for taking it had been to give him unlimited opportunity to be with her . She could give up the apartment , but she was unwilling , except as a last resort , to move from her charming and comfortable home into a cheerless hotel . She decided instead to take someone in to share the apartment withp276her . The prospect did not delight her , but it seemed the most effectiveway of dealing with Mollison . Besides , once the breach was complete , she could easily get rid of her tenant . She ran over the list of her acquaintances , looking for the most likely person , and finally hit upon her cousin , Marion Sweet . Marion was a San Francisco girl , who had recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after taking her bachelor 's degree at the University of California . She was a serious , studious young woman , tall , squareshouldered , deep-voiced , and thick-ankled . Except that she was intelligentand well bred , she was about as different from Virginia as could be imagined . This very disparity made her all the more desirable . Their interests were so unlike that there was little probability of their getting in each other 's way . Furthermore , Marion would be up and off to classes while Virginia was still asleep , and by the time Marion came home Virginia would be almost ready to leave for the theater . Virginia sounded out her cousin ( without , of course , disclosing her reason for making the proposal ) , and Marion leaped at the opportunity to leave the unattractive university dormitory for Virginia 's bright apartment , although it meant a long trip to and from classes She even offered to prepare dinner for Virginia whenever she wanted it , and Virginia , who knew that her cousin was an excellent cook , was pleased with the suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself and got tired of going out for all her meals . This way , instead of meeting Mollison at Pinelli 's or some other restaurant , she could invite him in , confident that Marion 's conversation and restrainingpresence would not encourage him to accept too often . It seemed an ideal arrangement , and the best time to put it into effect would be when she left for Boston . She could then present it to Mollisonas a temporary loan of the apartment to Marion , and upon her return to New York invent some excuse for her cousin 's continued occupancy . On Saturday , between the matinee and evening performances of Give Them All My Love , she had dinner with Mollison at Pinelli 's . As they were sipping their coffee she said , " Oh , by the way , I 'm lendingmy apartment to my cousin Marion while I 'm in Boston . " " Your cousin Marion ? Is she anybody I know ? " " I think you met her one day at cocktails . My hunch is that you were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know . She 's trying to discover radium or something . " " That 's the general idea . She 's a law student at Columbia . "  | " The one with the big bozooms and a voice like a bullfrog ? " He gave an exaggerated imitation of Marion 's husky voice . " You 're getting warmer every minute . " " What 's the idea ? " " Well , I thought it would be a nice change for her . Have you ever tried living in a girls ' dorm ? " " Not that I remember . " " It 's not an experience that a man would be likely to forget . " " When is she moving in ? " " Tomorrow , after I leave . " " Nuts ! " he said sulkily . " I was figuring on dropping in once in a while myself . " " Well , I 'm sorry . But I guess you 'll just have to live at home for those two weeks . It 'll be a nice change for you too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do that , " he grumbled . " I did n't have to . I just thought it would be a friendly thing to do . Which reminds me , you 'd better give me the keys . " " Ca n't you give her yours ? You wo n't need them in Boston . " " That 's not the point . " " What is the point ? " " Well , " said Virginia , " she 's a simple girl , and she might not understandyour barging in while she was cutting her corns or fighting her way out of her girdle . " " What the hell makes you think I 'd go near the joint with that ape-woman in it ? " " Oh , I do n't know . Force of habit . Conditioned reflexes . The murdererreturning to the scene of the crime . The dog returning to his vomit . " " You have a nice refined way of expressing things . " " That 's on account of my having gone to the very best schools . With washing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " Oh , go on with you ! You knew it all along . " She held out her hand . " The keys , please . " " I have n't got them on me . I 'll give them to you tonight , after the show . " " So you 'll have time to have duplicates made ? " She looked at her watch . " Well , I guess that still gives me time to have the lock changed . " " God , you certainly trust me , do n't you ? " he said angrily . Hep278reached into his back pocket , produced his key ring , and started tuggingat it . " Not in full view of the Actors ' Equity Association , if you do n't mind ! " said Virginia , enraged . She snatched the keys from him and , putting them in her lap , worked loose the ones to her apartment , breaking a nail in her haste and anger . Mollison beckoned to the waiter . " Give me a double brandy . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia , unable to suppressher anxiety . The waiter , about to go , hesitated . " What 's the matter ? " asked Mollison . " Did n't you hear me ? " " Yes , sir , Mr. Mollison ! " said the waiter , hurrying off . " And make it quick . I 've only got ten minutes , " Mollison called after him . " If you do n't mind , I like to do my own ordering . " " I 'm sorry , Huge , " she said . " It slipped out before I  --  " He cut her short . " When is that zombie getting out of there ? " " I told you I invited her to stay while I 'm in Boston , " said Virginia , trying to avoid a direct lie with which he could charge her later . The waiter brought the brandy . Mollison swallowed it in three gulps . Virginia , who usually walked around to the Stuyvesant with him , excused herself on the ground that she still had a lot of packing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausted from the trying scene and very much worried about Mollison , but thankful that she had been able to get possession of the keys so much more easily than she had expected . At half-past eleven Mollison rang the doorbell . He was silent and sullen ; but under the influence of her warm vivacity and of numerous highballs he thawed out , and they were soon on their old , easy , intimatefooting . Having won her first point , she could well afford to relent a little . When , at three o'clock , he yawned loudly and said that it was time for bed , she made no attempt to send him away . Indeed , the thought that this might be the last night he would ever spend there filled her with sentimental sadness and kindled a warmth she had not felt in a long time.  |p279As  the rehearsal period neared its end Eric grew more and more worried about money . His bank balance was down to three hundred dollars , and more than two hundred had to be reserved for the repair bills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Boston expenses and wondered if he dare ask Thompson for a loan . But if the play failed , he would be unable to pay it back . He had never borrowed a penny from anyone , and the prospect of going into debt was repugnantto his New England conscience . Besides , he was reluctant to revealhis extreme need . He was on the point of asking Irina Lanski 's advice , but before he could bring himself to do even that , Samuel Rothberg , the company manager , talked to him about his Boston living arrangements . " I reserved a room for you at the Marlborough , " he said . " I figured that 's where you wanted to stay . " " Well , I do n't know , " said Eric nervously ; then , summoning his courage , " Do you know how much it will cost ? " Rothberg stared at him in surprise . " Well , it depends on the room . Eight or ten bucks a day , I guess . " " Eight or ten dollars just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well , as long as you do n't have to pay for it , " said Rothberg , eyeinghim suspiciously . Not too quick-witted , he thought this might be some joke that was over his head . " What do you mean ? " asked Eric , puzzled . Rothberg gave him another sharp look . " It 's on the management . " " You mean the management pays for my room ? " " Why , sure . The management always takes care of the author 's out-of-town expenses . It 's in your contract . "  |p282the  best grace possible . He wished that he could display the tact that the situation demanded instead of letting her see his sulky displeasure , making matters more difficult for her . It was she who had to smooth things over . When they had gone as far as Stamford , with hardly a word , she said , " My gastric juices are clamoring for a salmi of grouse . How 's about you ? " He accepted with alacrity . When they had ordered Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern painting . At her suggestion Eric had paid several visits to the Museum of Modern Art and had become acquainted with the works of many contemporary painters . A lively discussion carried them through lunch , and when they returned to the parlor car they were on easy terms again . Most of the actors  --  several of whom had brought their husbands or wives  --  got off at the Back Bay station . But only the principals could afford to stay at the Marlborough ; in fact , the tryout was an unprofitableexcursion for the minor actors , since their salaries barely covered their out-of-town living expenses . Eric taxied to the Marlborough with Virginia . ( Pearl went on to South Station , for she had to stay at a remote hotel , where Negroes were acceptable . ) The Marlborough was one of the finest hotels in the United States , if not in the world , and Eric was shown to a large , charmingly appointed room , high up , with a fine sweeping view of the Common . He was dazzled by this unaccustomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra suit in the huge closet and distributed the rest of his scanty wardrobe through the commodious chest of drawers . He tried to imagine himself owning enough clothes to fill all that space but gave it up as a fantastic speculation . He answered the buzzer to admit Winternitz , who had an armful of newspapers . " Greetings from the Beacon Street soviet , comrade , " he said . " What are your impressions of the Athens of the West ? " " Well , I have n't had much time to look around , " said Eric . " I feel the same way myself . " He put the newspapers on the bed . " I 've brought a culling of the dominical feuilletons for your delectation . The tidings of our cultural activities receive modest attention . We are competing for the encomia of the multitudes with a lyrical divertissement alliteratively entitled Got ta Get That Gal . It is , I surmise , a callipygian etalage , and since the Pilgrim Fathers have an amiable predilection for the nether extremities of the shapelier sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squarely behind the eight ball . However , I have achieved the possible , without benefit of cheese cake . Further , I have arranged to have you catechized by Daniel O'Fallon , who vivisects the dramaturgic art for the Evening News , an estimable diurnal publication somewhat morbidly preoccupied with ax murders and Hollywoodian  --  or should I say Hollywooden ?  --  adulteries . The bar at six is the place and time . " " What am I supposed to say to him ? " asked Eric nervously . " Anything , my lad , anything  --  as long as you eschew polysyllables and keep your opinion of the Franco government to yourself . I am trying desperately to build you up as a clean-cut , wholesome Americanyouth . Alors , mon vieux , jusqu'a six heures ! " With a wave of the hand he was off . Eric went through the Boston papers , all of which contained publicitymaterial about his play . As Winternitz had pointed out , it was hard for a serious play , written by an unknown author and performed by relatively unknown actors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a popular comedian and a dozen shapely girls . But he had managed to place several news stories about the play , the cast , and Thompson , as well as photographs of Virginia , Florence Fulham , and Reginald Olmsted . Each paper also carried a large advertisementof the opening ( the quid pro quo of the publicity material ) , and he was pleased to see his play 's name and his own in bold type . He carefully clipped out all the items and put them in an envelopefor his mother . He went down to the bar at six , a little shaky about the interview ; but it passed off smoothly enough . O'Fallon was bored by this routine Sunday assignment and would far rather have been playing poker or golf , but he was cordial to Eric and tried , with the help of Winternitz , to find something on which he could base a readable story . From a reporter 's point of view Eric was not very promising material . He was not married or engaged , his war record was negative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live the life to which he had been born and try to find his way to a better one . At last , however , when Winternitz , who had been racking his brains , pointed out that Eric was a New Englander , O'Fallon brightened and said , " Well , that 's an angle ! " and proceeded to question him about his home town and family background . " Was I all right ? " asked Eric when O'Fallon had left . " My boy , you were superb , " said Winternitz , wringing his hand .  | " We 've been here since seven this morning and I guess we 'll be here all night , " said Peter . " At this rate we 'll be lucky if we open by Christmas . " Thompson was sitting in the third row with Arthur Eckstein . The scenic designer gave Eric a friendly greeting , but Thompson was obviouslynot pleased to see him there . He did not like having anyone about who was not useful , particularly when he was in a state of tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his watch . " How much time do you need for the lights ? " " Well , I really need a day and a half , " said Eckstein . He was a tall , heavy man , phlegmatic , deliberate , and slow of speech . " You know damn well you ca n't have a day and a half , " snapped Thompson . " Well , I think we 'd better let the carpentry and prop departments go at ten . They 're dead on their feet right now , and not much good for anything . We 'll start hanging then and knock off at two . The boys need at least six hours ' sleep . So we 'll come back at eight . When do you want the stage ? " " I 've called the company for two , " said Thompson . " And I 'd like to get started by three . We 've got a hell of a lot of work to do . " Eckstein shook his head . " It 's going to be tough . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's going to be mighty sketchy , so do n't expect too much . " " How long will the dress rehearsal take ? " asked Eric , regretting the useless question the moment he had asked it . " That 's a good question to send to some quiz program , " said Thompson irritably . " Maybe you 'll win a free trip to the Virgin Islands . " He walked down to the orchestra rail and called McCarthy . Eric , not wanting to be in the way , zigzagged across the stage again and left the theater . The weather , which had been mild , had suddenly changed . The temperature had dropped sharply , and a cold rain was falling . He could not get a taxi and walked back to the hotel in the drenching downpour.  |p287Eric  woke up with a cold in the head . Feeling miserable , he had breakfast sent up , telephoned the drugstore for aspirin tablets , and spent the morning in his room . Irina Lanski called him when she arrivedand at one he went down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still raining hard . But unwilling to miss the dress rehearsal , Eric ignored her advice not to venture out . They taxied to the theater , and she suggested that they go in through the lobby instead of going down the long , exposed alley with its deep puddles . The name of the play was being put on the big electric sign , and Eric felt a shiver of excitement at this evidence of the nearness of the first public performance . The box-office was open , but there was no one at the window . Irina Lanski identified herself and Eric , and the treasurer pushed a button that unlatched one of the entrance doors . It was a little after two . The stage was still crowded with workmen . The electricians , on their tall ladders , were angling lamps and inserting sheets of colored gelatin ; in the background the carpenters were hammering . Eckstein sat in the middle of the auditorium , behind a large drafting board , which was equipped with a telephonic device that had a backstage connection through which he gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and off , bank by bank , he consulted his lighting plot , on which each lamp was numbered , and ordered modifications in position , color , and intensity . The sound effectswere being rehearsed simultaneously , and he regulated their volumeand the position of the loudspeakers through which they were amplified . Winternitz was talking to Felix Obermeyer and his assistants , who were ready with their elaborate photographic equipment to take scene pictures as the dress rehearsal progressed . Claire and Fineman werep288moving around restlessly , worrying about the ever-mounting labor costs and even more about the weather . The advance sale had been light , and the predicted continuance of the downpour destroyed the hope of any last-minute demand . Thompson saw Eric and Irina Lanski enter and strolled up the aisle . " Howdy , folks , " he said . " Well , you 're in good time . This thing wo n't start for hours . " Then , as Eric sneezed convulsively , " For God 's sake , keep away from the cast with those sneezes . Two or three of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep things lively , Ginny has come up with an attack of laryngitis . There 's never a dull moment with this opera . " The night before Virginia had gone to visit friends and had caught a chill on her way home . Like most actors on the eve of an opening , she was in a tense and nervous state , which made her abnormally susceptible to any ailment . On awakening , she had a slight fever and an aching throat . She had sent for a throat specialist , who had advised her to stay in bed . But as she could not open in the play without a dress rehearsal , she had insisted upon coming to the theater . Eric heard this news with consternation . " Where is she ? " he asked . " In her dressing-room . We put a cot in there for her , and she 's trying to get some sleep . So do n't go back there . " " No , of course not , " said Eric , annoyed by Thompson 's imperious manner . " Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lanski . " Well , if she does n't , there 's no show . I think she 'll make it . I 've told her not to use her voice , and if necessary we 'll have the whole faculty of the Harvard Medical School in , to goose her up . " " But what about tomorrow night ? If she ca n't use her voice  --  " " We 'll open , come hell and high water . I 'm not having any more postponements . If I have to I 'll open with Lily Prengle . " " Do you think that 's wise ? " " Well , wisdom is not what I 'm famous for . All I know is that I 've got to find out what this goddam thing looks like , and I 'd rather see it tomorrow night with Lily than wait another two or three days . We 're not going to do any business here anyhow , so it does n't make much difference . If I ever get this one opened in New York I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you do n't mind , " said Irina Lanski to Eric as Thompson stalked down the aisle , " I think I 'll go back to the hotel and lie down for an hour . My old bones do n't travel as happily as they used to . And I ad/vise you to go back too and get into bed . You are not needed here , and what you see will only discourage you , especially if Ginny ca n't use her voice . " " I guess you 're right , but I think I 'd rather stay . " She shook her head . " I do n't know which is worse , the stubbornnessof young writers or the cynicism of old ones . " Eric took two aspirin tablets and then stretched out on a leather sofa in the smoking-room . He was anxious about Virginia and wanted to go backstage to see her . Since she was already infected , there seemed little likelihood that his visit would do her any harm . But he did not want to incur Thompson 's displeasure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squirming uncomfortably . At half-past three he went upstairs again . The stagehands were still busily at work . Irina Lanski returned shortly after four , and a few minutes later Thompson orderedthe work to stop . The electricians took down their ladders and two property men began to clear away the debris and sweep the stage . " All right , Mack , " called Thompson . " Take in your curtain , give us the house lights , and let 's get going . " The heavy curtain came down slowly , the lights in the auditorium came up . Eric was suddenly aware that he was sitting in a lighted theater , waiting for the curtain to rise for the first time on the play that he had written . There was another long wait ; it was almost five when the house lights slowly dimmed out . After five seconds of darkness the curtain went up on the first scene of the play . Eric 's excitement soon subsided . What he saw bore no resemblance to the performance of a play . From the very beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actors to correct a mistake , clear up some unforeseen difficulty , or demand an explanation for an exasperating delay . The actors were fumbling and jumpy . They were depressed by the weather , worried by the proximityof the opening , and tired from sitting idly for hours in their costumes and make-up . Because of the absurd method of rehearsing a play without the use of any of its appurtenances , they had to readjustthemselves constantly to their unfamiliar surroundings . The actual furnishings took up much more space than the rehearsal makeshifts , so that there was less room to move around in . The chairs and sofas were either higher or lower than the stock kitchen chairs , or else so soft that it was difficult to get out of them gracefully . Drawers stuck , doors opened with a suddenness that catapulted the actorp290onto the scene or refused to close behind him . Properties were missingor were of an unexpected shape or size . Sound effects did not come on cue and were too loud or too prolonged . And offstage there was a hubbub that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselvesexhausted , and working in semi-darkness , shouted to each other and knocked things down in their efforts to get the next scene ready . To add to the confusion the quality of the lighting kept changing as Eckstein telephoned instructions to the electricians to alter the readingon this lamp or that . As always there was a sharp though concealed conflict between the scene designer and the actors . The designer , naturallyanxious to have his settings make a favorable impression and knowing that bright lights tended to reveal the bolts and seams and paintiness of canvas scenery , tried to produce an illusion of reality by toning down the illumination and deflecting it as much as possible from the painted surfaces . The actors , on the other hand , liked the stage to he flooded with light , not only because a bright stage holds the attention of the audience more readily than a dim one , but in order that their facial expressions , which were an integral part of their performances , could be clearly seen . Thompson was inclined to side with the actors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was important , but an audience hardly looks at it two minutes after the curtain is up ; it looks at the actors all through the performance . Experience had taught him that the best way to handle Eckstein , for whom he had great admiration , was to let him have his own way at the beginning , and then bit by bit coerce him into intensifying the lighting . If Eckstein offered too much resistance , Thompson would wait until he went back to New York and then simply instruct the head electrician ( frequently a lighting expert himself ) to step up the readings to the desired brightness . In the meantime , however , the actors suffered agonies , complaining bitterly that they were invisible in the gloom that pervaded the stage , and constantly tried to edge their way into any bright area that they could find . Eric waited anxiously for Virginia 's first entrance . He was amazed by her fresh and girlishly healthful appearance , forgetting to take into account her skillful make-up and the flattering lights . But he soon saw evidences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sluggishlyand spoke in tones that even the actors could hardly hear and that were completely inaudible to those seated out front . It took nearly an hour to get through the first scene of the play . Then began the problem of speeding up the scene changes . The playp291was in eight scenes  --  four in each act  --  and required five sets of scenery . To quicken the changes , a device known as a jack-knife stage was employed . This consisted of two platforms , set on casters , on either side of the false proscenium and at right angles to it . They were alternately used , so that one could be reset offstage while the other was in view of the audience . As each scene was finished the curtain was lowered and one platform was pivoted back a quarter-circle to its offstage position while the other was pushed on into the vacated space in the proscenium opening . The platforms were simultaneously in motion and their movement resembled the opening and shutting of the blades of a pocketknife . Speed was of the utmost importance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a darkened theater , and the cumulative effect of the play depended largely upon a continuingmaintenance of interest . The production had been planned with a view to making these changes in thirty seconds ; but when the curtain fell on the first scene , more than four minutes elapsed before it rose again . Thompson , watch in hand , stood tensely in the aisle . " Hold it , Reggie ! " he called as Olmsted began to speak . " Well , Arthur , what about it ? Nearly four and a half minutes . " " It 's the first time they 've done it , " said Eckstein . " And they 're punch-drunk besides . Ask Harry to come on , " he said into the telephone . Harry Baumrucker shuffled onto the stage , trying not to show the aching weariness of his old body . " What went wrong , Harry ? " asked Eckstein quietly . " Well , it 's the first time through , " said Harry , shielding his one good eye from the blinding front lights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over four minutes , " said Thompson . " If that happens tomorrow night , we 're up the creek . " It was not the fault of the overworked men , but he had to keep the pressure on until after the opening . " Can you give me five minutes to routine it ? " asked Harry . " We 'll get it down for you once we get it rolling . " " All right , go ahead , and then let 's take another crack at it . " " Take it back , boys , " shouted Harry . The platform swung back , and the first scene rolled into place again . The actors slumped wearily in the chairs  --  all but Virginia , who had gone back to her dressing-room . Instead of five minutes , it took Harry twenty-five to get his men properly organized . Then Virginia wasp292summoned , the end of the scene was repeated for the curtain cues , and the change was made again . This time it took a little less than two minutes . " That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming on . " Still not good enough , " said Thompson . " We 'll get it licked before tomorrow night . Do you want to try it again ? " " Yes , but first we 're going to take pictures of this scene . " Felix Obermeyer and his assistants set up their cameras and floodlightsand posed the actors in the situations Winternitz had selected as the most effective for publicity purposes . It was a tedious process . The actors resignedly submitted to the photographer 's very precise requirements and tried to give an appearance of animation they were far from feeling . When the photographic apparatus had been cleared away the end of the scene was played once more . This time the change took only a little more than a minute . That was good enough for the present , and Thompson went on with the second scene . Again there was a series of delays , miscues , omissions , and misunderstandings , again the change to the next scene had to be gone through several times and the photographs taken . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thompson called an hour 's halt to give the cast and crew a chance to eat and snatch a few moments ' rest . He had sent for great quantities of coffee and sandwiches for the actors , so they would not have to go out in the rain . Eric and Irina Lanski want to a sea-food restaurant , next door to the theater . A few minutes later Claire came in with Winternitz and Fineman . Nobody was in a mood for conversation , and they went on to a table at the back . All through the rehearsal Claire had turned to glare at Eric each time he sneezed . Thompson had stayed in the theater to talk to Eckstein and to avoid Claire . Her exaggerated worry over every mishap and delay was an added annoyance ; he wished he could think of some way of getting her to leave , but he knew she would stay to the bitter end . Eric and Irina Lanski ate in silence . When dinner was over she said , " Perhaps I am just a self-indulgent old woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting in that theater , so I am going to my room and get into bed . And if you 'll take my advice , you 'll do the same thing . " " Thanks , but I think I 'll stay . I 'm worried about Ginny . Do you Think she 'll be all right ? "  | " Well , I hope so . But I do n't see how sitting there will help her , any more than an expectant father pacing a hospital corridor helps the screaming woman in the delivery room . " Eric smiled . " I guess you 're right . But in all the stories I 've read , the father goes on pacing until the baby is born . " He helped her into a taxi and went back to the theater . As he sat sneezing Thompson came up to him . " Why do n't you go to bed , Eric ? There 's nothing for you to do around here . We 've just got to sweat it out and hope to Christ we can give a show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a little while , " said Eric , without the slightest intention of complying . " How is Ginny ? " Thompson gave him a withering look . " How old is Ann ? " he said and walked away . It was nearly ten before the rehearsal was resumed . It dragged on in its dreary course , hour after hour . Tempers snapped under the strain of aching muscles and taut nerves ; there were sharp words and tears . Even Florence Fulham lost her habitual poise and bristled angrily when Thompson asked her to repeat a complicated piece of business . The final curtain did not fall until half-past two , and Thompson ordered it raised immediately and told McCarthy to call the company onstage . " Everybody but Ginny . Tell her I 'll be back to see her in a minute . " The actors came on , dragging their feet and sagging wearily against the furniture . " I wo n't keep you a minute , " said Thompson . " I 'm sorry it had to be this way , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had to be . We 're a long way from home yet , and much as I hate to do it we 've got to have another technical run-through tomorrow . " The actors groaned in protest . " Are you expecting us to give a performance tomorrow night ? " asked Olmsted acidly . " There ca n't be any performance without a run-through , I can tell you that . We 're going to have the critics in here tomorrow night , and I 'm not going to kick our chances away with a ragged production . So we 'll just have to grit our teeth and go through with it . I know you did n't ask to be born and neither did I , but that 's the kind of business we 're in . I 'll make it as easy as I can for you . No make-up , costumes , or acting ; but everything else  --  lights , props , effects , and scene changes . We 'll start promptly at two , and I promise to get you out of here by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's all . Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night . " The actors scattered to their dressing-rooms , bemoaning the day they had first set foot upon a stage . " The front of the house is locked , folks , " called Fineman to the people out front . " You 'll have to go out through the stage door . " They all moved over to the side aisle and up through the passdoor . Eric saw Gladys Kaye and asked her where Virginia 's dressingroomwas . As he approached it he saw Thompson going in and decidedhe had better keep clear of him . He groped his way through the tangle of scenery to the stage door . It was raining steadily , and he had difficulty in avoiding the alley 's deep puddles . The street was deserted . He did not dare take the long walk back to the hotel , so he stood under the marquee , determined to wait until a taxi came along . After about fifteen minutes one pulled up in front of the theater . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't take that , " he said . " It 's for Ginny . " McCarthy hurried down the alley . A few minutes later , Thompsoncame out carrying Virginia , with Claire following . Eric felt a sudden pang when he saw Virginia in Thompson 's arms , her head on his shoulder . As Thompson put her down she noticed Eric and beckoned to him to get into the cab . She and Claire got in and Thompson followed . " Well , come on ! " he shouted impatiently as Eric stood hesitating . Eric got in and put down one of the jumpseats . He turned to look at Virginia . She had not removed her make-up , but beneath it she was pale and her eyes were dull and heavy . " How are you ? " he asked . She shook her head and put her finger to her lips . No one spoke during the ride to the hotel , nor in the elevator . Eric was the first to get out . He took Virginia 's hand . " I hope you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but did not answer . He staggered down the corridor to his room , let his clothes lie where they fell , and tumbled into bed , breathing heavily and almost hysterical with fatigue . Brooding over Claire 's cold hostility , Thompson 's contempt , and his own unimportance to Virginia , he was overwhelmed by self-pity . As for his play , he saw no possibility of its opening in eighteen hours ; in his unhappy state he did not care whether it did or not.  |p295Eric  slept fitfully and awoke at noon , depressed and achy . The rain was still falling from a leaden sky . He tried to call Virginia , but the operator had instructions not to disturb her . He hesitated about calling Thompson , fearing another rebuff , and while he was debating it Irina Lanski called him . She had just learned from Thompson that the doctor was reasonably sure that if Virginia spent the day in bed she would be able to go on that evening . Thompson had instructed McCarthy to have Lily Prengle stand in for her at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , since he was not needed at the theater . He gladly agreed , arranging to have dinner with her at half-past six . When Thompson arrived at the theater Richard Ismay , the actor who had handed in his part at the time of Emily Crandall 's collapse , was waiting for him . The play in which Ismay was appearing had opened in Boston the week before and was playing its second week . " Hello , Mr. Thompson , " he said self-consciously . " Oh , hello , Dick , " said Thompson , suspecting why he was there . " I know this is no time to bother you , but I just wanted to ask you to keep me in mind in case there 's any change . " " I thought you were in that Jack Homburg show . " " I am , " said the actor ruefully . " Or rather I was . The notice went up last night . " " It 's not opening in New York ? " " It never should have opened in Boston . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business has been brutal . They shot a deer in the balcony at the Saturday matinee . " " Well , imagine that happening to a Homburg production ! " said Thompson with more than a touch of malice . " I guess you think I was a dope for not sticking with you andp296I damned well know I was . But I thought you might not go ahead , and , Mr. Thompson , I 've got grocery bills like nobody 's business . " " It 's too bad , " said Thompson . " I wish I could help you out . But I 'm pretty sure I wo n't be making any changes . " " I figured you would n't , but I thought I 'd ask , just in case . Well , maybe next time . " " Oh , sure . Come in any time I 'm casting . " " Thanks , Mr. Thompson . And believe you me , next time I 'll stick . " He extended his hand . " All the good luck in the world to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I hope you heard right . And good luck to you . " " Thanks a lot . I sure need it . I have n't had a break in three years . " As Ismay went dejectedly out into the rain-swept alley Thompsonfelt a twinge of sympathy for him . He was an exceptionally capable actor , but the theater offered him no security or continuity of employment . He was a counter in a gambler 's game , and the energies that should have gone into the development of his talents were expended in the frantic struggle to meet his family responsibilities . Thompson had little interest in economic theories , but he reflected that there must be something wrong with a system that squandered and wasted good human material . He had given strict orders that the run-through was to begin at two , to give the actors at least three hours ' rest before the evening performance . The stagehands had come back at nine and had spent a busy morning , putting things in order and devising means of correctingthe defects the dress rehearsal had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lights . He was seemingly tireless and never got ruffled no matter what the provocation . Promptly at two Thompson had the company called . He eyed them quickly as they came on . They were silent and in low spirits , but a night 's rest had relaxed them somewhat ; they were no longer at the explosion point . " Well , here we are again , " said Thompson . " First of all , I want to tell you that Ginny 's medicine man is quite sure she 'll be able to go on tonight . " The cast brightened perceptibly . Glancing quickly at Lily Prengle , he saw that she was half relieved , half disappointed . " This is just technical today , and we 're going right through , no matter what happens , so if anything goes wrong , just crash right ahead as though it were a performance . Do n't use your voices and never mind the acting . All right , we 'll start right away , and I 'll guarantee to have you out of here by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actors dispersed  --  all but Lily , who stood looking at him with languishing eyes . He had to say something to her . " Gladys is on the book , so if you need any help , just yell for it , " he said , pressing her arm . She trembled at his touch . " I wo n't need it , " she said almost inaudibly . " Good girl , " he said , walking away quickly . After the episode at the Farow , Thompson had deliberately avoided being alone with Lily and barely spoke a personal word to her . He was uncomfortably aware that her eyes were always on him ; but by maintaining an appearance of constant preoccupation with the play he made it almost impossible for her , as a minor member of the cast , to approach him . At the day 's end he checked over notes with the principals or with McCarthy until Lily had gone ; and he left with someone else in case she might be waiting outside . He kept away from his hotel until late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did find messages from her ; he made no reference to them , and she did not either , merely gazing at him in reproachful despair . He could not go on like this indefinitely ; since only three days remainedbefore his departure from New York , he succeeded in carryingit off . As it was , he left for Boston somewhat sooner than was absolutely necessary , merely to be out of her way . He was quite certain that she could not afford to stay at the Marlborough , but consultedRothberg 's list of hotel reservations to reassure himself . In Boston the pressure of work made any personal contact impossible , at least until after the opening , and that gave him another three or four days ' respite . The problem of what to do about her was a constant irritant . Daily and hourly he cursed himself for his act of folly . For want of a moment 's judgment , a moment 's self-control , he had become involved in a situation from which he did not know how to extricate himself . The simplest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his failure to resist an irresponsible impulse and to tell her , bluntly , that since there was no possibility of any future relationship between them , the best thing for her would be to forget what had happened as quickly as possible . But that would mean a long , harrowing scene ; reluctant either to bear pain or to inflict it , he shrank from the tears , the reproaches , and the pleadings of adolescentagony . Besides , there was always the possibility that her humorless , intense nature might drive her to suicide . Years ago he hadp298had a somewhat similar experience , and he shuddered as he remembered the narrow margin by which a tragedy had been averted . To go on with Lily , however , was impossible , for they lived on different planes of thought and feeling , and , as far as he was concerned , even the physical attraction was not very strong . If she could take it all lightly and casually , he might be willing to go on until they tired of each other . But it was evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grand passion , and he knew that nothing was more boringand distasteful than being the object of an unrequited infatuation . He put off facing the situation , hoping that when at last he was forced to , the day would be saved by some happy improvisation or unexpected turn of events . In contrast to the stumbling dress rehearsal , the run-through proceededwith smoothness and dispatch . Eckstein and the three veteransof the Farow Theater had straightened out the snags and coordinatedthe various elements of the production . Everything was in place and on time , the lighting had been vastly improved , and the scene changes cut down to about a minute . Thompson made numerous notes , most of them dealing with easily correctible errors . When the final curtain fell and the company rehearsed the curtain calls , which he had carefully planned , he said a few words of encouragementand dismissed them . " Just a moment , folks , " said McCarthy as they started to leave the stage . " I just want to say that curtain time is eight-thirty and I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be called but not the scenes . We 've got all we can handle here as it is . So it 's up to everybody to watch their own cues and be responsible for being on time . And when you finish a scene , kindly leave the stage . We 're so jammed up here we could n't get anything else on with a shoehorn , so let 's not have anybody around who is n't needed . And , one more thing , watch the offstage talking . We 've got a lot of fast and tricky cues that are hard to pick up , so please , everybody cooperate by not talking . Okay , that 's all I 've got to say and thank you . " When the actors had left Thompson called the crew on . They filed onto the stage , sixteen tired men in overalls and work clothes . " That was very good , boys , " said Thompson , " and I want to thank you all for a swell job . I know it 's been a tough one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we 're that good tonight there 'll be no kick coming . "   " We 'll be better tonight , " said Harry Baumrucker . " That 'll be all right too . I 've got a few notes for you , Harry , and for Charlie and Ira . But that 's all for the rest of you , and thanks again . " The men filed off impassively . His words strengthened their morale , a factor whose importance Thompson never minimized . One reason his productions functioned smoothly was that he saw to it that his stage crews were friendly and cooperative , instead of sullen and indifferent . The stagehands were , in a sense , the black sheep of the theater . Because they were invisible and anonymous , the value of their contributionoften went unrecognized . Managers , authors , and actors had a tendency to look down upon them and to charge them with laziness , malingering , stupidity , and incompetence . But directors like Thompson and scene designers like Eckstein , who worked in close collaboration with the stagehands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingenuity and resourcefulness were invaluable in the solution of difficult technical problems . There were bunglers and misfits among them , to be sure , but there were also actors who did not know how to act , authors who did not know how to write , and producers who did not know anything . Undoubtedly instances of " feather-bedding " and even racketeeringcould be found among the stagehands ' union 's practices , and the inflexibility of its regulations often imposed needless hardships upon productions that were struggling for survival ; but these abuses were often over-emphasized by those who would have been only too ready to take advantage of the workmen if they had not the protection of a strong organization . Superficially , it seemed anomalous than an industry which , on its managerial side , was unorganized , wasteful , inefficient , and chaotic , should be , on its operational side , one of the most tightly organized in the American economy . The incongruity was more apparent than real , for the restrictive unions had developed as a measure of selfdefenseon the part of workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swindled by unscrupulous managers . The result was a condition under which honest and fair-minded employers had to bear burdens that could have been eased if they had had the foresightand initiative to establish and enforce a code of ethics that would have put the crooks and the exploiters out of business . As it was , the failure of the managers to regulate and stabilize thep300industry and to provide security and continuity of employment forced the workers to do what they could to protect themselves against the economic hazards of their occupation . Since employmentin the theater was sporadic , seasonal and of uncertain tenure , the unions had adopted abnormally high wage scales in an effort to provide their members with an adequate annual income . Consequentlythe peak load of labor costs had to be carried in the weeks of active production instead of being distributed over a period of continuous operation , so that many plays had to close while there was still an active popular interest in them , thus creating more unemploymentand demands for yet higher pay to bring up the weekly average . A closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actors , the musicians , the scenic artists , the scene painters , the press agents , the company managers , the box-office employees , the wardrobewomen , the truckmen , and the maintenance men . The Dramatists ' Guild too , while not a labor union , required membership of everyone professionally engaged in writing , translating , and adapting for the stage . Unfortunately all this organization was on a craft and not on an industrial basis . Though each union was justifiablyconcerned with the welfare of its own members , all ignored the primary and paramount fact that they had a common interest in establishing a sound and efficient economy . A body representative of all the crafts could undoubtedly have found solutions for many of the over-all industrial problems affecting everyone , but the Americanprejudice against " planning " could not be overcome ; so the American philosophy of every man for himself and the devil take the hindmost prevailed . After the run-through Thompson went backstage to go over his notes with the three heads and McCarthy . It was more than a halfhourbefore he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone long ago ; but when he got to the stage door she came running down the stairs from the dressing-rooms and caught up with him . " Hello , Lily , " he said , taking her arm . " Have you got those firstnightjitters ? " " Yes , I guess I have , " she said , pressing close against him . " Though I do n't know why , with the little I have to do . " " Everybody has them . Even the wig-maker is out there biting his nails and hoping the star does n't knock the heavy 's toupee off . P301Look out for that puddle ! " She was paying no attention to where she was going , oblivious to everything but his nearness . He hailed a passing taxi without stopping to think that he could not very well leave her standing there , particularly since the streets were still wet . " Ca n't I give you a lift ? " he said , making the best of it . " If it is n't out of your way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay State first and then the Marlborough , " he said to the driver . The moment the cab started she threw herself against his shoulder . " Oh , I 've been so lonely ! A whole week , and you have n't said a word to me or even noticed me . " He put his arm around her . " Well , I 've been a little bit busy , honey . This is a tough show to get on . " " Oh , I know that ! All I wanted was just a look or a smile . Oh , kiss me , darling , please kiss me ! " As he bent his head she glued her lips against his . He responded automatically  --  not without an involuntaryglance at the driver 's immobile head . " Oh , thank you , thank you ! " she said . " Am I never going to see you again ? " " Well , that 's a silly question , " he replied , not ungently . " But give me a chance to get this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me now ? Or let me go with you just for a few minutes . I 'll leave the minute you tell me to . " " I wish I could , dear , but I 've got some newspaper people waiting for me at the hotel , " he said , snatching at the first excuse that occurred to him . Fortunately the Bay State Hotel was only three blocks from the theater , and they were already there . " Anyhow , " he said , opening the door of the cab , " you 'd better be concentrating on your work . I do n't think Ginny will be up to two performances tomorrow and I may want to put you on at the matinee . " " Do n't worry about me . I 'll be ready . And I wo n't let anything interfere with my work . " " I 'll see you later . " Lily walked quickly to the hotel entrance . As the cab moved away she turned and threw him an agonized look . He leaned back and closed his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was not likely that he would have been tempted by her ; if he had been , he certainly would not have found himself in his present situation . P302Eric got up at six , feeling much the better for his day 's rest . Beforegoing down to dinner he called Virginia 's room ; there was no answer . He wondered where she could be . Irina Lanski quickly reassured him . She had met Virginia in the lobby , as she was leaving for the theater . She wanted to make up early , so that she could have an hour 's rest in her dressing-room before the performance . The agent had attended the run-through and gave Eric an encouragingreport . " I think everything will go quite smoothly tonight . So all you need worry about now is the play . " " That 's not much , is it ? " said Eric with a weak smile , breaking into a cold sweat . " I suggest that you take a cocktail , or , better still , two cocktails , to fortify yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When the cocktails were brought she raised her glass . " To the success that you deserve and that I hope will be yours ! But if you will take my grandmotherly advice , you will not expect too much either from the audience or from the press . In fact , even an enthusiasticreception will mean very little as far as New York is con-cerned . " " Then why go through all the expense and agony of a tryout ? " " That is a question I have often asked myself , " she said . " The managers will tell you that the actors need the experience of playing before audiences before they face the New York first-nighters , and that it allows time to correct weaknesses in the play . In my opinion , a half-dozen previews in New York would accomplish the same purpose at no greater cost and at an enormous saving to everyone 's nervous system and disposition . " P303While they were having a second cocktail Claire came into the dining-room with Anthony Weir and another man , who smiled and waved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said to Eric as the man came over to her . He was slender and stoop-shouldered , with graying hair and gold-rimmed spectacles . There was a perpetually quizzical smile on his deceptively youthful face . " Irina , my darling , " he said , stooping to kiss her cheek , " how are you ? And why do I see you only in moments of crisis ? " " Perhaps it is because my life consists entirely of moments of crisis . Do you know Eric Kenwood ? " " I do now , " said Haig , beaming at Eric and extending his hand . " May I say that I admire your fortitude , Mr. Kenwood , in sitting at table on such an occasion ? I usually spend my first nights supine in an oxygen tent , desperately dictating codicils , while a fully accouteredcleric hovers about , prepared to administer the last solemn rites . " " Maybe that 's what I 'll be doing when I 've had a little more experience , " said Eric . " No , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear wonderful reports and I 'm well equipped with soothing lotions for my smartingpalms . But I must return to my hostess . Poor , dear Claire ! I alwaysfeel for her on a night like this ! For what is the tug at our heart strings compared to the pull on her purse strings ? The best of everything to you , Mr. Kenwood . And the customary ten per cent of the best to you , Irina . " He beamed at them both again and went over to join Claire and Weir . " Does he always talk like that ? " asked Eric . Irina Lanski smiled . " I 'm afraid poor Freddy is an acquired taste . You probably do n't like truffles either . " " I 've never had any . Do you think he came all the way from New York just to see the play ? " She nodded . " At Claire 's insistence , I 'm sure . She is a great gatherer of expert opinions , especially when they cost her nothing . " Feeling as he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased to have Haig called in to sit in judgment on his own work . He already was conscious of an anticipatory emotional resistance to any suggestions that Haig might see fit to make . Eric had eaten little all day , and the cocktails went to his head . I le had no appetite and hardly touched the substantial dinner he P306others were following the ushers down the aisles . Through the curtainthe buzz of conversation and the clatter of seats could be plainly heard . Eric gazed out at this gathering of casual strangers who were so soon to sit in judgment upon his play , envying them their detachmentand almost hating them for it , like a prisoner on trial for his life who covertly eyes the jury upon whose verdict his existence depends . As he left the set he encountered Thompson . " Well , Eric , think you 'll live through it ? " " I doubt it . " " Well , good luck ! " said Thompson , extending his hand . Eric grasped it warmly . " Good luck . And thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaye was making the rounds again , calling , " Fifteen minutes ! " She knocked on Virginia 's door , then went up the iron stairs to the upper dressing-rooms . On his way out Eric saw numeroustelegrams thumbtacked to the call board , expressions of good wishes to the cast from Thompson , Claire , Irina Lanski , and several others , including one from Tucson , Arizona , that read : " My heart is with all of you tonight . " It was signed " Emily Crandall . " He was mortified by his own omission and hoped the cast would understand that it was due to his ignorance of theatrical customs and not to thoughtlessness or ingratitude . Irina Lanski was waiting for him in the crowded lobby . They shuffled along slowly into the well-filled auditorium . Eric did not know that half the audience was there by invitation . The press had been liberally supplied with seats by Winternitz , and , in addition , Fineman had judiciously distributed enough tickets to ensure the presence of a large audience . The giving out of tickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the producingmanagement and the theater management . The producer , knowing how greatly the cast was affected by the volume of applauseand laughter , was always anxious to have the house packed , while the theater owner was fearful of establishing a precedent that might interfere with the sale of tickets for future productions . Fineman , by stubborn persistence , usually had his way on opening nights , but for subsequent performances he could seldom overcome the opposition of the theater manager . Eric and Irina Lanski had seats in the fourth row on the aisle . With trembling hands he opened his program and turned the pages  |p307slowly  until he came to the playbill . He tried to read it , but all that was visible was his own name , which leaped out at him from the printed page . Glancing across the aisle , he was startled to see Daniel O'Fallon sitting in the third row . A report of his interview with Eric had appeared in the Evening News the day before . It was an innocuous piece that dwelt a little too much , Eric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Mr. O'Fallon , one of the critics , " he whispered . Irina Lanski merely nodded . At half-past eight the audience was still coming in . Eric kept glancing anxiously at his watch . A few minutes later the members of a small orchestra squirmed through a little door under the stage and , taking their places in the pit , began to play a medley of airs from The Pink Lady . It was a ragged and spiritless performance ; as Eric listened , he reflected that nothing could have been less likely to put the audience in a proper mood for his play . However , he was apparently the only one who was paying attention to the orchestra . He sat in an agony of suspense for what seemed a half-hour ; actually the musicians played for only six or seven minutes . The performancefinished with a feeble flourish , and the conductor bowed profoundlyin response to feebler applause . " I come here every time convinced that they could not play worse than the last time , " said Irina Lanski . " And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eric hardly heard her , for the lights were beginning to dim . As they slowly faded out and the buzz of the audience subsided , Eric dug his nails into his palms and caught his lower lip between his teeth . Irina Lanski pressed his knee with her hand , and he welcomed that friendly touch . After ten interminable seconds of darkness the curtain rose slowly . With perfect synchronization , the balcony spotlights were brought up the instant the curtain had cleared the path of their radiance . There was scattered applause for Arthur Eckstein 's fine , atmospheric setting ; then the first actor entered , went to the telephone , dialed , spoke his first line . The play was under way . Florence Fulham 's entrance evoked a round of hearty applause , mostly from the gray-heads , who remembered the days of her stardom . There were a few handclaps for Olmsted too . ( He explained , later , that they emanated from his creditors , who were anxious for the play to succeed so that he could pay what he owed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she too was greeted with warm applause . She was not generally known to theatergoers , P308but she had many friends in Boston and a considerable number of them had come to the theater . There was no sign of her illness . She looked fresh and charming and moved with briskness and authority , taking instant command of the stage and making that vivid first impression that is so important for the actor and for the play . Her voice sounded clear and unforced . But Eric , whose eyes never left her , saw her glance for reassurance toward the stage box , beside the pass-door , where her throat specialist was seated , prepared to go backstage on a moment 's notice . As the performance progressed Eric 's feverishness mounted . Withoutknowing what he was doing , he repeated every line of the play to himself and shook his head disapprovingly at every slight omissionor error , though the audience , of course , was entirely unaware of the minor lapses . Nor were he and Virginia the only ones who had been affected by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sneeze he turned his head impatiently in the direction of the sound . Frequently he glanced across the aisle at O'Fallon . Except for an occasional nod or shake of the head in response to a whispered comment from his female companion , the critic maintained an air of impassivity . Eric wondered anxiously what he was thinking . When the curtain fell on the first scene Eric clutched the arms of his chair , fearful of a long delay . The change was made swiftly , and he breathed a sigh of relief . In fact , the whole act moved with technical perfection and the actors seemed at ease . Several times he was surprised by the audience 's laughter . There was almost no humor in the play , but Thompson , knowing the importance of an occasional break in an audience 's tension , had taken advantage of every idiomatic turn of speech and every oddity of small-town characterization to produce a healthful comedic effect . Occasionally , however , when there were laughs where none were intended or desirable , Eric squirmed unhappily . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the house lights came up Eric leaned back to relax his tensed muscles . Half the spectators left their seats and filed up the aisles to the lobby for a stretch and a smoke . The throat specialist got up and disappeared behind the curtains of the box . Eric , with Virginia very much on his mind , wanted to go back himself but was afraid he would only be in the way . " It went very well , " said Irma Lanski . " Do you really think it did ? " Eric asked .   " Yes . For a first performance far better than I expected . Why do n't you go out and smoke a cigarette ? You worked harder in that act than any of the cast . " Eric laughed . " I guess I did . Do n't you want to come along ? " " No , I 'll stay here if you do n't mind . I find that I no longer enjoy these mass migrations . " Eric joined the slow procession . The beneficial effect of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt congested and heavylimbed . In the lobby he moved about from group to group , keeping his ears open for comments about the play . He heard only exchanges of social pleasantries or snatches of conversation about business , the weather , and the day 's news . He went to the men 's room to take an aspirin tablet , and it was there that he heard the only reference to the play . " How do you like that little red-headed number  --  what 's her name ? " a man asked his companion . " I do n't know  --  Virginia somebody-or-other . Very snazzy . She can come and play in my back yard any time she wants to . " " Listen , feller , she 's welcome right in my front parlor  --  on Mabel 's bowling nights , of course . " They both laughed and then , as the warning bell sounded , moved toward the stairs to the lobby . " What is there , just one more act ? " " Yes , and I think that 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not cheered by their remarks . In the lobby he was surprised to see James Duncan . " Hello , Jim ! " he said . " What are you doing here ? " " Hell ! " said Duncan , " Do n't you know a dramatic critic when you see one ? " " You mean you 're going to review the play for the Standard ? " " What else ? You 're practically Coltertown 's leading dramatist , and the Standard gives its readers complete news coverage regardlessof expense . You look terrible . How do you feel ? " " Terrible ! " They were at the back of the auditorium and the lights were dimming . " Will you meet me afterwards ? " " Ca n't . I have to drive back home tonight . " " Well , I 'll be seeing you . " " You betcha . " Eric hurried down the aisle , flustered by Duncan 's presence and disappointed by his friend 's failure to express an opinion . He did not understand that Duncan , somewhat inflated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and objectivity regardlessof friendship . " Well , I 'm glad you decided to come back , " whispered Irina Lanski as Eric dropped into his seat just as the curtain was rising . The second act was a worse ordeal for him than the first . He found it hard to breathe , and the strain was beginning to tell . Every cough , every sign of inattentiveness , every minute defect in the performance , took on an exaggerated importance . He sat hunched up , wondering dismally if the play would ever come to an end . At last the final curtain fell . Before it had touched the stage numerousspectators  --  including , Eric noticed , Daniel O'Fallon  --  hurried up the aisles . The majority remained to applaud as the curtain rose again to reveal the entire cast lined up behind the footlights . The calls followed the usual procedure : first the whole company ; then the secondary players , and finally the principals . If Emily Crandall had been in the play she would have taken the last call alone , an honor accorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have liked to take a solo call , for the importance of her part warrantedit . Thompson was inclined to give it to her , but the contracts of both Florence Fulham and Reginald Olmsted provided that they were to receive equal prominence with anyone but Emily Crandall . The appearance of the three together evoked a burst of genuinely enthusiastic applause and even a few cries of " Bravo ! " Eric felt a flush of exaltation , as he gazed at Virginia standing there , smiling and bowing gracefully , so vivacious and self-possessed . The curtain fell on the trio , the house lights came up , the orchestralaunched into a funereal rendition of a Sousa march , the audience crowded into the aisles . It was over ! " Good ! " said Irina Lanski . " Very good ! " Eric , numbed and weak , felt only a desire to get out of the theater . The pass-door was on the opposite side , and it took them fifteen minutes to work their way around the back and down the side aisle . Virginia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negligee of dark green crepe de chine . A dozen friends , the women in long dresses and fur capes , the men mostly in dinner jackets , were showeringher with compliments , and she was talking excitedly to everybodyat once . " Come in ! Come in ! " she called to Eric and Irina Lanski . " There 's always gloom for one more . " The visitors made way for them . Irina Lanski threw her arms P311around Virginia and kissed her . " You were beautiful , darling ! Simply beautiful ! " " Well , I managed to say all the words , and that 's about all . Eric , if you 're thinking what I think you 're thinking , have a heart and do n't say it . " " I think you were wonderful , " murmured Eric . He wanted to kiss her too , but did not dare with all those curious eyes on him . A quick look at Virginia 's face told him that her vivacity was assumed and that she was dead tired . " People , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this valiant youth is the father of it all  --  Eric Kenwood , the author . " She rattled off a string of names , none of which Eric in his self-consciousness could connect with these nonchalant men and elegant women who stood gazing at his inflamed nose and bleary eyes , his tousled hair and ill-fitting clothes . A few shook his hand and offered congratulations , but he did not know what to say to them . Making way for some new arrivals , he edged his way out of the room almost unobserved . He wanted to get back to the hotel , but Irina Lanski told him that he must not neglect the other actors . Dutifully he made the round of the dressing-rooms with her . It was worth the effort , for they were all obviously hungry for praise . Thompson had asked him to come to his suite after the performancefor a general conference . When they reached the hotel Irina Lanski suggested that he rest a half-hour first , warning him that the session would be a long and tiring one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was damp with perspiration . He undressed , took a warm shower , and got into bed , brooding over his inability to get really near Virginia . The sight of her in the midst of those well-to-do and sophisticated people with whom she was so much at home made him feel , more than ever , that she inhabited an alien world in which he had no place . He closed his eyes and wished that he could sleep for a week , or perhaps forever . After ten minutes of this desolate yearning for oblivion he threw off the covers , put on fresh clothing , and went to Thompson 's apartment . Thompson 's secretary opened the door for him . " Oh , hello , Mr. Kenwood . Come right in . " As Eric entered the large sitting-room Thompson came forward , a highball in hand . " Here 's the goddam author now , " he said . " We thought you were riding the rods back to Connecticut . " " I 'm sorry if I 'm late but  --  "   " Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink . We may as well fatten him up before we take him apart . " " What will you have , Mr. Kenwood ? Scotch , bourbon , beer ? " " Scotch , please . " She went to a table which was loaded with bottles , glasses , icebuckets , and platters of sandwiches . Irina Lanski , Claire , Fineman , Weir , and Eckstein were all there , and , to Eric 's dissatisfaction , Frederic Haig . " Scotch , " said the secretary , handing Eric a drink , and then , as she hurried to the door in answer to the buzzer , " Help yourself to a sandwich . " " Thank you , " said Eric , suddenly aware that he was very hungry . Everybody else was already supplied , Weir being conspicuous with a large glass of tomato juice . Katherine Swayne came back , followed by Winternitz . " Peace to all here , " he said , bowing , his palms downspread . " May the Lord make His countenance to shine upon you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thompson . " He has n't had time to write them yet , " said Weir with his loud , mirthless laugh , in which no one joined . " Nothing very specific , " said Winternitz . " I met Jerry Walters of the Eagle as he was rushing for his deadline , and he said he thinks I 've put on a little weight . " " Well , that 's encouraging , " said Thompson . " All right , kiddies , let 's get down to business . But before we get into a general brawl , I 'd like to give everybody a chance to speak his piece . Katie , get out your notebook and be sure you get every point . First of all , I 'd like to hear from Freddy , since he saw it for the first time and is fresher on it than anybody else . " " Would you think it very fresh of me , " said Haig , beaming at everyone , " if I just recited Danny Deever ? I do it awfully well , won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , come on , Freddy ! Do something to earn your keep , for Christ 's sake . As it is , Murray is griping about paying your fare and room rent . " " Wisecracker ! " said Fineman , shaking his head . " I 'll forego my customary porridge and breakfast frugally , Murray , " said Haig . He peered around with his alert , birdlike air . " Well , since I have been thrust upon the podium , I must compliment Mr. Kenwood for his fine play . Very direct , very forceful , very intense . P313I found myself all eyes and ears , quite stirred and shaken ; in fact , if Mr. Kenwood will forgive me , perhaps too shaken . " " You think the end is too melodramatic ? " asked Thompson . " Well , too something . Perhaps I have n't an adequate capacity for carnage . My doctor hints at a deficiency in my blood count . The fault is mine , I have no doubt . " " I agree with Freddy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . " Thompson glanced at her in annoyance . " Freddy may be right about that , " he said to Eric . " No , no , quite wrong , I 'm sure ! " said Haig with a deprecatory flutter of his hands . " The whole play points to that ending , " said Eric , his voice trembling . " And there 's no possible way of changing it . " He resented not only the older playwright 's thinly disguised dislike of his play , but the deference that everyone paid to his opinion . " It 's possible to change anything , " said Thompson with a shade of irritation . " Besides , who said anything about a different ending ? It 's a question of doing it in a less obvious way , that 's all . " " Well , I do n't think there is any other way of doing it without weakening the play , " said Eric , stubbornly . " And , of course , you could n't be wrong , could you ? " said Thompsonsarcastically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm and checked an angry retort . " Yes , I could be , " he said sulkily , " but I do n't think I am . " " Excuse me for butting in , " said Weir , " but I felt the need of a little comedy here and there . Of course , I 'm only a layman , but then so is the average man out there in the audience . I 've been thinking that if Freddy happened to have a few good laugh lines up his sleeve , why , it might not hurt a bit . " " Absolutely ! " said Claire . " A few laughs would help , " said Fineman . " Laugh lines , my dear Tony , " said Haig , " are not , unfortunately , the product of legerdemain but of profound visceral agonies in the small hours of sleepless nights . " Weir laughed loudly . " I stand corrected ! But I 'm still for getting those laughs in . Do n't you agree , Tommy ? " Eric waited tensely for Thompson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinker with his play , no matter what pressure was P314brought to bear upon him . In his self-absorption it did not occur to him that Haig was there only because Claire had so persistently urged him to come , and that he had not the slightest interest in making any contribution to the play . " No , I do n't agree , " said Thompson . " Let 's face it . The play is a tragedy , and it 's got to stand or fall on what it is . If we try to gag it up now , it 's going to look like just that , and we 'll be doing ourselvesmore harm than good . " " I think you are entirely right , Tommy , " said Irina Lanski . " If they want jokes , let them go to Got ta Get That Gal . " " Or to Give Them All My Love , matinees Wednesdays and Saturdays , you might have added , my dear Irina , " said Haig , shaking his forefinger at her . " Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Freddy . " " That is why you are not a successful playwright , darling . But I am entirely in accord with you and with Tommy . As a pastrycook of sorts , I can tell you that the spices must be baked into the cake and not sprinkled on at table . " " I do n't think they should laugh in the third scene , " said Claire irrelevantly , " when Ginny says to her father  --  " Thompson interrupted impatiently . " Yes , I know , I know . There were a half-dozen bad laughs . I 've got notes on all of them and I know how to kill them . " He got up and mixed another highball . " Have you got any notes on the performances , Freddy ? " " Well , I did venture to jot down a few minor observations , " said Haig , taking a sheet of paper from his pocket . " I hope I can read them . I am not at my happiest when I write in complete darkness . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Winternitz . Thompson listened attentively to Haig 's comments . And though Eric felt an instinctive hostility to everything Haig said , he had to recognize the acuteness of the playwright 's observation and his sensitivity to false values that Eric himself had not noticed . In turn , Thompson called upon the others for their notes . In the course of the ensuing discussion a hundred details were debated . The lighting , the costumes , the stage business , the actors ' readings , the content and meaning of certain scenes , all were subjected to criticalcomment and analysis . Some of the criticisms Thompson acceptedimmediately ; others he brushed aside ; still others led to long and acrimonious arguments . Under the influence of alcohol and P315the stifling air of the smoky room , tempers quickened and voices became blurred . In an effort to fight off fatigue Eric devoured sandwiches and repeatedly filled his glass . As hour after hour dragged by he was less and less able to attend to what was said and was conscious only of an indistinct babble of voices heard through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference came to an end . Winternitzhad long been dozing ; the others were drooping from exhaustion . Eric staggered to his room , dizzy and nauseated , and soon fell into a drunken sleep . He was awakened at half-past ten by the ringing of the telephone . Barely able to open his eyes , he groped for the instrument . With difficulty he grasped that Fineman was inviting him to breakfastin Thompson 's apartment . He fell back upon the pillow , struggling to recall where he was and why he was there . At last he forced himself out of bed , his head splitting and his mouth dry and bitter . A cold shower revived him somewhat , and he hurried into his clothes , suddenly remembering that he had not seen the reviews of his play . Thompson 's sitting-room had been put in order and ventilated . He was seated at a large , round table , breakfasting with Claire , Fineman , and Irina Lanski . They were all reading the morning papers . " Hello , Eric , " said Thompson . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess I am , a little . " The director , in his handsome brocade robe , appeared amazingly fresh . The others too showed no sign of indisposition . " Well , how do you like your notices ? "  | " I have n't seen them . " " Now , there 's a blase young author for you ! I expected you to be up all night , haunting the newsstands . " " Are they good ? " asked Eric . " Not bad , " said Irina Lanski . " Kendall Petrie is quite good , Walterson the good side , and the others neither one way or another . Here , you 'd better read Petrie first . " Claire excused herself and left the room as Irina Lanski handed the paper to Eric . He read the review with eager attention . Kendall Petrie was known to Eric by reputation . He was the oldest and perhaps the most influential of the Boston critics . A man of considerablelearning and intelligence , he was noted for his long , analyticalcritiques of books and plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victorian . His review was lively and appreciative . He understood the tragic intention of the play and praised it for its integrity , dramatic effectiveness , and essentially poetic quality . He had his reservations too , and his caustic references to immature writing and to what he considered lapses in taste made Eric wince . He had yet to learn the rarity of unqualified praise . " Well , he does say some good things about it , " he said when he had finished reading the review . Thompson laughed . " I 'll settle , right now , for three or four like it in New York . " " Yes , I agree , " said Irina Lanski . Eric read the other reviews . Gerald ' Walters wrote approvingly too , but in rather superficial terms and with a tendency to facetiousness . The others were evasive and noncommittal . They pointed out that the play had many merits and many defects , that it was still in a " rough state " and needed " lots of work , " " pulling together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say anything very much , do they ? " said Eric . " It 's a technique , " said Irina Lanski . " If the play succeeds in New York , it is because the necessary work has been done ; if it fails , it is because it has not . Either way , they can not be wrong . " " Do n't be cynical , Irina , " said Thompson . " It does n't become you . " The buzzer sounded . " That 's probably Doc with the afternoonpapers . " Fineman opened the door for Winternitz , who had a stack of newspapers under his arm . " How are they , Doc ? " asked Thompson .   " Passionate affirmations of negativity , " said Winternitz , giving them each several papers . " All but Korpsbruder O'Fallon , whose eulogies are somewhat muted . In fact , he seems to confuse Eric with Jack the Ripper . A condonable error , if you will forgive my saying so , " he said with a deep bow to Eric . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to a rendezvous with a lady journalist who wishes me to discourse on the woman 's angle  --  though , personally , I detest angular women . " They were all reading the papers and paid no attention to his departure . Eric reddened with anger at O'Fallon 's virulent denunciationof the play . He called it immoral , indecent , morbid , offensive , and an affront to womanhood , a play that no father would want his daughter to see . " Why , he 's just a fool ! " said Eric vehemently . " He 's missed the whole point . " " This may help business , " said Thompson . " It should certainly bring the daughters in . " " You should feel flattered , Eric , " said Irina Lanski , flinging the paper aside . " It reads exactly like the fin de siecle reviews of Ibsen . " " You 've got some work to do , Eric , " said Thompson . " As I expected , Cornelius McLaughlin paid Murray a little visit this morning , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Who 's Cornelius McLaughlin ? " asked Eric . " He 's an ex-traffic cop who is now the official guardian of the town 's morals . He is also , I believe , the Mayor 's father-in-law . " " Cousin , " said Fineman . " Pardon me , cousin . Anyhow , he 's the boy who tells you what you ca n't do in Boston . And here it is . " He handed Eric a sheet of paper on which were typed the required excisions and alterations . " But this is crazy ! " said Eric agitatedly . " If we do all this it 'll change the meaning of the play . " " Could be . But it 's what we 've got to do . " " But it 's ridiculous ! Listen to this : the word whore ' may not be used . Why ca n't I say whore ' ? The Bible says it . " " Well , I 'll take your word for it . But the Bible is one thing and Boston is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And we have n't time to get new costumes . " " Costumes ? " said Fineman nervously . " There 's no kick about the costumes . "   " Take it easy , Murray . Just a figure of speech . " " Oh , " said Fineman dubiously . " May I see that , please , Eric ? " said Irina Lanski . He handed her the civic censor 's demands . " What if I refuse to make these changes ? " he said to Thompson . " Then I 'll make them . That will be a violation of my contract with you , and you can complain to the Dramatists ' Guild . They 'll write me , demanding an explanation , and by the time I get around to answering we 'll be running in New York and the whole thing will be an academic question . " " Ach , but this is preposterous ! " exclaimed Irina Lanski , getting up and pacing the room in a fury . " Here we sit in a world city , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a fine library , a famous symphony orchestra , a great tradition of literature and learning and culture , and we , we people of the theater , we permit the wonderful art we live by to be kicked around like a shabby vagabond by a little , ignorant , filthy-minded police official . It makes me want to vomit ! " Thompson stood up and applauded . " Lanski for President ! What do you want me to do  --  fight City Hall ? " " Yes , fight City Hall ! And fight the Cathedral ! I am a good daughter of the Church but when I see art attacked , when I am deniedmy American right of free speech , then I say , fight ! Fight in every way that is possible . Appeal to the press , rouse the civic organizations , hold mass meetings , distribute handbills , go through the streets with sound trucks , invoke the courts . Fight for the rights that the law and the Constitution give you . " " Yes , that 's what I say ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , that 's a fine program , folks , " said Thompson , " and in my next incarnation I 'll put on a hair shirt and mount the barricades . But right now I 'm trying to get this show into New York . We either make the changes or they shut us down while we 're out holdingthose mass meetings , and that adds another twenty thousand to our cost . If you ask me , that 's a high price for a couple of whores . " " It 's the principle of it ! " said Eric . " With me it 's the dough . When does he want these changes in , Murray ? " " Well , he said for the matinee but I can stall him along until tonight I guess . "   " All right , go ahead . " " Okay , " said Fineman , starting for the door . " Anyhow , by the middle of next week you can start sneaking the cuts back in , and nobody will know the difference . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Thompson . " I 've got to dress and get around to the theater . I 've excused Ginny from the matinee and I want to do a little work with Lily . Meet me at six , and we 'll go over the cuts , so that I can give them to the cast before tonight 's show . " " How is Ginny ? " said Eric , feeling guilty for not having asked sooner . " I have n't called her , but she 'll be all right , especially after she reads her notices . It was mostly nerves anyhow . Here at six ! " He went into the bedroom . " What can I do ? " asked Eric as he and Irina Lanski left the suite . " Nothing , " she said . " Not if Tommy wo n't fight . And , of course , we ca n't expect him to fight alone . For that , united action is necessary . But everybody is too busy being ruggedly individual to find time to unite for the common defense . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will do it , just as he said . He knows very well that we are not going to protest to the Dramatists ' Guild and that they could do nothing if we did . " The cast was waiting for Thompson on the stage of the Mayflower . Now that the strain of their first public appearance was over the actors were beginning to relax . The reviews , too , were reassuring ; the critics , almost without exception , had praised the actinghighly . Unlike Eric , who had concentrated his attention on what was said about the play , the actors had turned immediately to the last two or three paragraphs of the reviews , which , according to custom , were devoted to a discussion of the performances . A few were indignant about O'Fallon 's scathing denunciation of the play , but , on the whole , they paid little attention to the gibes and stricturesthat had wounded Eric and there was a general feeling that the tone of the press was distinctly favorable . Thompson briefly discussed the reviews and the first night performanceand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the play 's reception . Then he ordered the curtain lowered and rehearsedLily until it was time for her to dress . It was all strictly professional and impersonal ; even had they been alone , the girl 's P320nervousness would have prevented her from thinking of anything but her performance . At the end of the rehearsal Thompson went to the box-office . Though he had expected little sale for the matinee , he could not escape the sinking feeling induced by the sight of batches of unsold tickets in the racks . There had been little demand for future performances either . The box-office men were not very hopeful about the outlook . In their opinion , the reviews were not sufficiently enthusiastic to createan immediate public interest . It all depended , they said , on " word of mouth , " the spreading of favorable reports by members of the audience  --  animponderable factor that took time to operate . Thompson delayed the rise of the curtain for a few minutes on the chance that there might be a few late ticket-buyers . The interior of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectators were clustered in the front rows ; the rest of the lower floor was empty . In the balcony , too , there were whole sections of unoccupied seats . Printed slips inserted in the programs informed the audience that Lily was appearing in Virginia 's stead , so that there was hardly a murmur when McCarthy appeared before the curtain to make the required announcement . Virginia 's name was so little known that the audience felt no particular disappointment . The performance was a listless one . Not only were the actors let down after the excitement of the night before , but the smallness of the audience and the weakness of its response offered them no stimulus . Nor did Lily 's performance . Thompson , to whom the nervousnessand unsureness beneath her outward calm were apparent , was thankful that he had resisted the impulse to entrust the part to her after Emily Crandall 's withdrawal . Undoubtedly she had great talent ; in a summer theater or amateur company she would have seemed quite brilliant . But in scenes with such expert actors as Florence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident . All in all , it was a wasted performance . Thompson wished that he had canceled it instead of letting Fineman , who was worried about every dollar , persuade him not to . He did not want to go back to see Lily , but his failure to do so would have a devastating effect upon her . She was using Virginia 's dressing-room , and Thompson , as always , entered without knocking . " Just a minute ! " said Pearl , as Lily quickly got into her dressingP321gown . Pearl started to leave , but Thompson motioned to her to stay . I Ic had no wish to be left alone with Lily . " I just cane back to tell you that that was all right , kid , " he said , patting her head . " Oh , no , it was n't ! I was just awful ! " Her tears began to flow . " Well , I think you were damn good , if that means anything to you . " " 1 just could n't seem to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was just doing it the first time , that was all . I 'll be better next time . " " You were all right today , " he insisted . " I would n't say it if I did n't mean it . You 've just got the jitters , that 's all . Did you have any lunch ? " She shook her head dismally . " I thought so . Well , get the hell out of here , and get yourself a good dinner , do you hear ? " " All right , I will . " In the mirror he could see her eyes imploring him to have dinner with her . He said quickly , " Well , I 've got to run . We have to get in some changes tonight , and Eric is waiting for me at the hotel . " Since , for once , he was telling the truth , he was annoyed by her obvious disbelief . " I 'll see you later . And do n't let anybody tell you you were n't good . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was waiting for him on the stage . " I hope you did n't tell that girl she was good , " she said in the taxi . " What do you think I told her , that she stank ? " " You did n't have to tell her anything . " " I 'll be glad to have your ideas sometime on how to handle actors . " " Yes , I know , " she said . " Actors are n't in my department . All thesame I told you that she 'd never be able to play that part . " " Who are you arguing with ? She 's not playing it , is she ? " " Did you get the figure for the matinee ? " " Yes , I did . It 's a dollar-fifty more than I looked for . " " It 's not so funny when you have to pay the bills , " she said plaintively . Thompson 's eyelids flickered angrily . " Well , just say the word and we wo n't bother taking it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said hastily , afraid he might mean it and that she would not only lose her investment in the play but have an empty New York theater on her hands . Even more , she dreaded the suffering he could inflict upon her when his anger was aroused . " Do you want to have dinner in my suite ? " she asked as they got out . P324He went back to the hotel with Thompson . Refusing a drink , he ordered a pot of coffee to keep himself from falling asleep . He marveled at Thompson 's capacity for alcohol and work , as the director , glass in hand , paced the room , acting out the new ending he had conceived . Eric , out of stubbornness and sheer fatigue , finally agreed with great reluctance to test the new ending at the next night 's performance , on the understanding that if it did not go well it would be abandoned . On Thursday the company rehearsal lasted all afternoon . The new ending did not require many verbal changes but called for a considerablealteration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great care . Thompson had edited the voluminous notes that had been made at the opening-night conference and introduced a hundred refinementsand modifications of detail . Eric took advantage of a momentwhen Virginia was not on the scene to ask her to have dinner with him , but she had an engagement . She had many friends in Boston  --  formerschoolmates , family connections , and acquaintances from her previous theatrical visits  --  and had more invitations than she could possibly accept . Seeing his keen disappointment , she suggested that they visit the Gardner Museum together on Sunday . She was dining in Brookline and spending the night there , but she had the afternoon free . His anticipated happiness made it hard for him to concentrate on the rest of the rehearsal . The evening audience was not much larger than Wednesday 's , but the performance was far smoother and the play went well . Eric had to admit that the new ending was an improvement . It was less melodramaticand achieved his purpose without too violently assaulting the sensibilities of the audience . Thompson was not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tirelessly experimenting with one modification after another in an effort to find just the right solution . The spirit of the company was good . The actors had supreme confidence in Thompson and , realizing the value of his suggestions , worked hard and diligently . The Friday night house was better , the sale for Saturday night heartening . The box-office men reported a modest demand for the following week 's performances and were a little more optimistic than they had been after the opening . Thompson was on the whole encouraged . The week 's receipts would be far below what was required to meet the operating costs and the heavy expense of the dress rehearsal ; but he had been prepared for that  --  and for far worse ! He knew from bitter experience how disas-P325trous public apathy can be , not only financially but in terms of disappointedhopes and shattered morale : the agony of performing to a handful of indifferent spectators and of seeing months of careful preparationand hard work go for nothing . As long as people were coming in and , apparently , liking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On Saturday he found a note from Lily in his morning mail . It was unstamped and had evidently been left by her at the hotel desk . It read : " I 'm so lonely . Please find a little time for me after the show tonight , or tomorrow sometime . Oh , please , please do ! " There was no salutation and it was signed simply " L. " He tore the note to bits and cursed Lily and himself for the thousandthtime . Busy as they all had been with rehearsals and performances , he had plausibly avoided her since the Wednesday matinee . Sunday was a day of rest , and he could think of no way to make her believe he did not have a free moment between the Saturday night curtain and the Monday afternoon rehearsal . Besides , even to attempt to convince her he would have to talk to her , either on the telephone or at the theater  --  he did not want to risk writing  --  and he shrank from the prospect of what was sure to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the large blue eyes , the words of meek reproach . No , he could not face it . Nor could he bring himself to ignore the note completely and behave as though he had not received it  --  especiallynot with another whole week in Boston ahead . The best course was to leave for the weekend , on the pretense of business in New York . He could see the play that evening with what promised to be a well-filled house and leave on the midnight train . But he hated sleeping cars and the thought of arriving in New York at seven o'clock Sunday morning was a dismal one . Remembering that Claire had sent for her car and was planning to drive to Poundridge , he decided to go with her . It would mean missing the evening performance , but it would serve the double purpose of evading Lily and making things up with Claire . He put off consideration of how to get through the next week and went down to lunch with Claire . She was delighted to hear that he wanted to go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matinee was over . He did not go backstage before the performance , sending back word to McCarthy to hold the cast on the stage after the final curtain . He sat at the back of the house , but he could not keep his mind on the play . After fifteen minutes he got up and walked out , suddenly real- P326izing how tired and stale he was . Even leaving Lily out of it , he was glad to get away from the theater for a few days . He spent an hour or more in the box-office , watching the steady progress of the sale for the evening performance . At the end of the performance he went backstage , carrying his overnight bag , in accordance with his carefully prepared plan of campaign . He saw Lily 's eyes go to the bag and felt he had scored his first point . Unwittingly Virginia helped him out . " Hey , Duce , you 're not walking out on us , are you ? " " Yep . Just one jump ahead of the sheriff . Pete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if Mrs. Weir 's car is out front , will you , and tell her I 'll be right out . Oh , here ! May as well put my bag in too . " " Yes , sir , " said Peter Quirt , taking the bag . " Well , since Ginny has guessed my secret , there 's not much more for me to say , " said Thompson to the cast . " I 've got a lot to do in New York , and so I 'm driving down with Mrs. Weir . As some of you may have heard , we 're opening there , come a week from Wednesday . " Virginia groaned , and everybody laughed . " Sorry I ca n't watch the performance tonight , because we 'll come damn near selling out and I know it will be a good show . Mack will be in general charge , and you will agree that I could n't leave you in worse hands . " This provoked another laugh . " Will you put that in writing ? " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to rehearse tomorrow , I 'm sure that he  --  " Hoots and catcalls drowned him out . " The noes seem to have it . All right , that will give you a chance to catch up on your churchgoing . Morning and evening services , and lots of time in between to do your laundry . " Peter Quirt returned . " The car is out there , sir . " " Thanks . There 'll be a company call on Monday at one . And I guess the same on Tuesday . I want to get everything cleaned up by then , because the show we play Tuesday night is the one I want to open with in New York . I guess that 's all , unless anybody has a question , a complaint , or a good blue story . " " Do n't get your feet wet , " said Florence Fulham , " because we all love you and need you . " The other actors applauded heartily . " Okay , I 'll buy a pair of rubbers in Providence , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little something for you , Miss Fulham , " he said , giving Florence a kiss . " Oh , thank you , kind sir ! " P327As the actors were leaving the stage Thompson turned to Lily . She had stood motionless throughout his talk to the cast , not laughing or giving any sign of hearing what was said . " Get a good rest over the weekend , " he said , patting her cheek , and then in a whisper , " Sorry about tomorrow . " She did not reply , walking quickly off the stage . 1 le had avoided her eyes , but he could feel the intensity of the pain and reproachfulness in them . He gave McCarthy some instructions , then , on a sudden impulse , went to Virginia 's dressing-room and walked in . " Is that you , Pearl ? " asked Virginia , who was pulling her dress over her head . " Yes , Miss Ginny , " said Thompson . " Oh , it 's you , is it ? " said Virginia , squirming into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wo n't you ? I did n't hear your knock . " " My father used to have a sign in his office that said , Come in withoutknocking ; go out the same way . ' " " Why , you 're just a chip off the old block , are n't you ? " " I thought I might as well kiss you good-by , too , " he said . " Well , that 's a constructive idea . " She stood quite still , and he kissed her on the lips . " An old Thompson custom . " " You 're a fine upstanding wench , " he said . " And very good in the show . " " Every man to his taste . " He laughed . " I 've got to run . See you Monday . " She stood looking after him for a moment , then turned to the mirror . Her cheeks were flaming beneath her make-up . She pressed her hands to them . " Do n't be a goddam idiot , " she said in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pearl came in . " I 'd o ' swore I heard you talkin ' to somebody , " she said , looking around in perplexity . " Pearl , you 'd better lay off those chocolates . They 're beginning to beat against your eardrums . " P328Virginia 's doctor had urged her to get as mach rest as possible . All week she had obeyed his instructions , going straight from the theater to bed . On Saturday night some friends came back and coaxed her to come to their home for a drink . The play had gone very well indeed , with the large audience , and she felt stimulated and in the mood for a little gaiety . So she accepted the invitation , intending to stay only an hour ; but by the time she got back to the hotel it was after two . She hung the Do Not Disturb sign on the doorknob and told the telephone operator not to call her before noon . But she was keyed up , her head buzzed with a thousand thoughts and fancies , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awakened by a pounding at the door . She half opened her eyes , closed them again , turned over , and tried to go back to sleep . The pounding continued , and , muttering curses , she threw back the covers and stumbled to the door . " Go away , whoever it is , " she said angrily . " It 's me . Open the door , " said a familiar voice . Wondering if she could be dreaming , she unlocked the door and peeped out . Hugh Mollison was standing there . " Well , for God 's sake ! " she said . " Hi ! " he said . " Hope I did n't wake you up . " Half asleep though she was , she heard the elevator door open . Afraid that someone might come along the corridor , she checked an angry retort and opened the door wide . Mollison stepped into the room . She quickly closed and locked the door and switched on the lights . Mollison took her in his arms and kissed her . " Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " P329She freed herself , sat on the bed , and yawned noisily . " What time is it ? " " 1 do n't know . About eight-thirty . " He pushed her clothes off the chair beside the bed and sat down . " What makes you so late ? " she said petulantly . " I took the sleeper after the show and just checked in . I tried to call you but the woman would n't connect me . You do n't seem very happy to see me . " " I did n't have a grand levee on my calendar . I just got to sleep about ten minutes ago . " " I did n't sleep at all . I was over a flat wheel and there was a yowlingbaby across the aisle . " " You look like something the cat brought in , " she said , eying him with disfavor . He was unshaven , his clothes were crumpled , his breath alcoholic . " I feel worse than that , " he said , yawning and rubbing his bloodshot eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stood up with alacrity . " That 's a corking idea . Phone me when you wake up . " " I 'll just nudge you , " he said , starting to undress . " I think we 'd do better solo . This is pretty narrow for two . " " We 've been in narrower ones , " he said , loosening his tie . Seething with anger , she got back into bed . When she woke up she was startled to find him beside her ; it took her a moment to account for his presence . He was sound asleep , breathing heavily . She put on a dressing gown , opened the draperies , and sat by the window , glancingoccasionally at Mollison , trying to think of the best way to deal with this unexpected situation . It was almost two ; she had arranged to meet Eric at three to go to the Gardner Museum with him . She dreaded calling it off , knowing how disappointed he would be ( she had been looking forward to it herself ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him along unthinkable . She strode angrily to the bed and shook him vigorously . He merely groaned and turned over . Clenching her teeth , she began pinching him and pulling his hair . " Come on , Huge , snap out of it ! " she said sharply . " Look out of there ! " he said , flailing his arms and sitting bolt upright , his eyes still shut . He opened them slowly and looked at her in surprise . " Oh , it 's you ! I thought somebody was trying to murder me . " He rubbed his upper arm . " Get yourself up out of there , " said Virginia . " It 's two o'clock . "   " What of it ? We 've got all day and all night . " " All night ? Are n't you taking the sleeper back ? " This was going to be worse than she had feared . He nodded . " Tomorrow night . Or maybe I 'll wait and take a day train Tuesday . I hate sleepers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said incredulously . " Well , Tuesday . You 're old enough to know what Tuesday means . I want to see the show tomorrow night . That 's one reason I came up . The other was I wanted to see you . " " Look , Huge , " she said in desperation . " Just try to follow me , will you ? Before Tuesday comes Monday , see ? And that is a night on which there is a performance of Give Them All My Love at the Stuyvesant Theater , which by the latest reports is situated in New York . That 's point one . Point two is that , according to Darwin , one body can not occupy two places at the same time . Q.E.D. Which , translated freely , means Quick Exit Desirable . " He yawned and stretched . " I 've got an understudy . " " You mean that George Hamlin character ? " " George is a pretty good actor . " " There are two schools of thought on that point . But you know damned well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any George Hamlin . " " Then let the management refund . They can afford it . I have n't missed a performance since the show opened . What the hell am I  --  a galley slave ? " " No , a sharecropper , who only gets ten per cent of the take , " she said . " All right , let them dock me for one performance . With my tax situation , it costs me buttons . " " Suppose what you wittily call the management takes it into its little head to gripe to Equity . " " Not a chance . They need me more than I need them , and they know it . " " Please go back , " she begged . " I 'm asking you please to . " " Sorry , but I 'm sticking . " " All right then , " she said grimly . " In that case I wo n't go on tomorrow night . I can work up a beautiful case of laryngitis at the drop of a voice . " " Good ! That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 'll take in a peepshow and then maybe dig up a crap game afterwards . " P331He rubbed the back of his neck . " God , I feel logy . Think I 'll take a shower . " " Wait a minute , Huge ! " But he was already in the bathroom . She lighted a cigarette and thrashed around the room , trying to hit upon some expedient for get-s iug rid of him . At last she decided there was nothing to do but locate Thompson and appeal to him for help . " I feel a little better , " said Mollison , coming out of the bathroom . " Then why not toddle back to your room and take off that RipVan Winkle make-up ? Better put on your clothes first though . " " What 's the hurry ? " he asked , sitting on the bed again . " I 'd like a little privacy , if you do n't mind , " she said , her eyesblazing . " Well , why did n't you say so ? " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celerity of an actor , who is used to making quick changes . " How long will you be ? " " I 'll phone you when I 'm ready . " " Well , do n't make it too long . I 'm beginning to get hungry . Shall we eat downstairs ? " " Yes , all right . " She opened the door for him , locked it quickly behind him , and called Eric 's room . He answered almost instantly . She visualized him sitting by the telephone , waiting for her to call . " Hello , Eric , " she said . " Listen , Puppchen , I 'm afraid I 'm not going to be able to make it this afternoon . " " You 're not ? " His hurt voice made her want to cry . " No , " she said glibly , hating herself for her mendacity , " my throat seems to be tightening up again , and I think I 'd better have a treatmentbefore it gets worse . So I 'm popping right around to old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Gosh , I do n't see how . It 's almost three now and my friends from Brookline are picking me up at five . I 'm terribly sorry about it , Eric , but there 's that play of yours that goes on tomorrow night . " " Yes , certainly . You 're sure it 's nothing serious ? " " Oh no , " she said , glad that he did not know how serious it was . " The squirt gun will fix me up fine . And if you do n't hate me too much , I 'd like a rain check and we 'll go to the Gardner later in the week . " " Yes , of course . Any time you say , " he said , trying unsuccessfully to make it all sound casual .   " Good boy ! I 'll see you at Philippi , otherwise known as the Mayflower , tomorrow . " She blew her nose and then put in a person-to-person call to Thompsonat his New York hotel . He was not there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Poundridge . She waited tensely , wondering what to do if she could not reach him . Luckily he was there . " Hello , Tommy , " she said . " This is Ginny . Remember me ? " " Faintly , " he said . " Well , that 's exactly how I feel . " She spoke truthfully , for the sound of his voice made her feel weak . " What 's the matter  --  has the theater burned down ? " " Oh no , I 'd like that ! This is something really grim . Big , boyish Huge blew into town a little while ago . " " Did he ? That 's nice . " " Think so ? Well , I guess it all depends upon where you sit . " " Why ? Is he stinko ? " " Not yet . But that 's not what 's worrying me . He 's given birth to the quaint notion that he 's staying over to see tomorrow night 's show . " " The hell he is ! " said Thompson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You 're darn tootin ' ! Ca n't you talk him out of it ? " " Not in the present condition of my vocal cords . Hence the S.O.S. " " Well , let me think a minute . " There was a long pause . " How about Fineman ? Do you think he can handle it ? " " I do n't know . Murray is a fine braw lad , kind to animals and all that , but I do n't think he ever majored in psychology . " " No . I guess you 're right . I suppose I 'd better sashay up there myself . " She sighed with relief . " I feel like an old clinging vine , asking it of you , but this one is really too hot for me to handle . " " Do n't apologize . This is what God made managers for . All right , I 'll see what kind of a plane I can get out of La Guardia and shoot up as fast as I can . Think you can hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've simply got to leave here at five , Tommy . Some people are giving a dinner party for me in Brookline . They 'll never forgive me if I do n't show . It was all arranged weeks ago and I just ca n't wriggle out of it . " " Well , do n't worry about it . I should get there by seven at the latest , and I guess he 'll still be right side up by then . "   " I hate myself for doing this to you . " " I 'd have paddled you if you had n't . Does he know I 'm not in Boston ? " " Not from me . And I 'm sure he has n't talked to anybody else . " " All right , go to your dinner party and leave Little Rollo to me . Ilow do you feel , by the way ? " " Better since hearing the sound of your strong right arm . " Immeasurably relieved , she bathed and dressed quickly , wondering what Thompson saw in Claire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand what people saw in each other . Perhaps he was wondering what she saw in Mollison . She had begun to wonder about that herself . Her next move was to avoid being seen with Mollison . If they ate in the hotel dining-room or as much as walked through the lobby together , it was more than likely that they would run into some memberof the cast , or , worse yet , Eric . She remembered a little Italian restaurant near the hotel where they were not likely to meet anyone they knew , especially at this hour . She hurried down to the drugstore and called Mollison . " Where the hell are you ? " he demanded . " I 've been calling your room . " " I had to buy a few things in the drugstore . Listen , do you mind if we eat at Guiseppe 's ? I 'm getting awfully sick of the Marlborough 's incomparable cuisine . " " I do n't care where we eat as long as it 's soon . " " All right . Come right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . I played Boston before you were born . " She made a few purchases to corroborate her story , then went to Guiseppe 's , which was almost empty . Mollison arrived a few minutes later , looking more presentable . He had had a few more drinks but was still fairly sober . They ordered dinner immediately . He had time for only one whisky before the soup was served . Virginia ordered a bottle of wine to keep him off spirits , and the substantial food , too , helped to steady him . " This was a good idea , " he said , leaning over and kissing her . " What 'll we do when we 're through ? " The moment had come to take the next hurdle . She braced herself . " I 'm afraid I 'm booked . " He looked at her sharply . " What do you mean , booked ? " " I 've got to go out to Brookline for dinner and overnight . "   " Oh , well , what the hell ! Call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's a booth over in the corner . " She shook her head . " Ca n't . They 're in town , " she invented rapidly , " attending some recital or other , and they 're picking me up at the hotel at five . " " All right , leave a note for them at the desk . Tell them  --  oh , I do n't know ! You can think up something . You 're much better at lying your way out of things than I am . " " Thanks , chum . But I do n't want to lie myself out of this , as you so charmingly put it . It 's Meg Kimball , whom I adore and have n't seen in years , and she 's invited a lot of my old friends . I 'd feel like a heel , standing her up at the last minute , and what 's more , she 'd never forgive me . " " And what about me ? " he said plaintively . " What am I supposed to do with myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing you could do is take a nice six o'clock train and be in your nice bed in New Canaan before midnight . " " Let 's not go all over that again . It seems to me that when I come all the way up from New York just to see you  --  " " And go to all the trouble of kicking in my door to notify me of your arrival . " " I only decided to come on the spur of the moment . There wasn'ttime to phone or wire . I thought you 'd be glad to see me . " " I 'm delighted to see you . But I 'm not going to insult Meg . " " It seems to me she insults pretty easy , " he said . " All right then , take me along . " " I 'm afraid that is n't practicable . " " Why not ? " " I do n't think they 're expecting you . " " What of it ? People like that must have an extra fork . If not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along . " " I guess I have n't quite made my point . It 's not a question of cutlerybut of people 's ideas of correct behavior . " " Oh , pardon me ! I guess I 'd better brush up on my Emily Post , I 've been to dinner parties where I 've been treated as a celebrity . Who are these people anyhow ? " " Just some illiterate natives who think La Vie de Boheme is the source of an opera by Puccini and not a mode of existence . " " You 've been going into that finishing-school act of yours an awful lot lately . And I do n't care for it . "   " I 'm sorry I do n't give satisfaction , " she said . " Maybe you 'd like to give me my two weeks ' notice . " He gave her a pained look . " There was a time when you 'd break any engagement to be with me . " " There was a time when I was a virgin . Times change . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And God fulfills Himself in many ways . Lest one good custom should corrupt the world . " She looked at her watch . " I 've got to go pack an overnight bag . " " The least you could do is get back tonight . Do n't tell me you ca n't get out of staying over . " " I was rather looking forward to it . I 've been holed up in that Marlboroughbedroom for a week and the idea of a change appeals . " " I see . " They walked back to the hotel in silence . " I think I 'll go into the bar for a while , " said Mollison . " What about tomorrow ? " " Well , we 're rehearsing at one . " " How about lunch ? " " Swell , if they get me back here in time . I 'll phone you in the morning . I 'm sorry about all this mix-up , Huge , but it just ca n't be helped . " " Uh-huh , " he said and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little after six , having caught a four-thirty plane from LaGuardia Field . The clerk handed him a note from Virginia , telling him where she would be in case he wanted to get in touch with her . He looked in at the bar , but Mollison was not there . If the actor had gone out he would have no way of tracing him . He called Mollison 's room . Fortunately he was in and still able to talk coherently . " Hi , Hugh , " said Thompson . " When did you blow into town ? " " This morning . How did you know I was here ? " asked Mollison , suddenly suspicious . " They told me at the desk when I came in . Are you alone ? " " No . I 've got a couple of bottles with me . " " Well , why not move on over here ? I 've got a case . " " All right , I will , " he said after a moment 's hesitation . He had been sitting around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to drink himself into a stupor . But he hated being alone and welcomed the prospect of companionship , especially Thompson 's . Besides , sooner P336or later , he would have to justify his presence in Boston . He dressed and went down the hall to Thompson 's suite , a little on the defensive and not knowing whether to assume a truculent or a conciliatory attitude . To his relief , Thompson greeted him with great cordiality , apparently taking his presence there quite as a matter of course . Thompson 's nonchalance was not entirely assumed . He saw at a glance that Mollison was still manageable . Indeed , as they settled down to drink he looked forward to an evening of pleasant relaxation  --  just what he needed after the week 's grinding work . He much preferred Mollison 's company to Claire 's ; though the actor was emotionally and intellectually adolescent , he was also good-humored , amusing , and , most important of all , undemanding . They had had many drinking sessions and got on well with each other . Thompson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it did not interfere with his performances . It was only for secret and pathological drinkers , like Anthony Weir , that he felt contempt . He let Mollison do most of the talking  --  not only because it kept down the actor 's consumption of alcohol but because it helped heal his badly bruised vanity . Mollison talked mostly about himself , and the more he talked the better he felt . Thompson listened with an appearance of the deepest interest , subtly flattering him and smiling appreciatively at anecdotes he had heard a dozen times . Gradually bringing the conversation around to The Clouded Mirror , he describedthe play 's reception and dwelt on the excellence of Virginia 's performance . " Yes , I hear she 's great , " said Mollison , his face clouding . " I wish I could see her . " This was the moment to tell Thompson he intended to stay for the Monday performance  --  he had not taken seriously Virginia'sthreat not to appear  --  but they were having such a pleasant time together that he could not bear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thompson looked at his watch . " Say , " he said , " if you 're meeting Ginny or something , do n't let me keep you . " " No , " said Mollison , unhappy again , " she 's off somewhere , with some of those ritzy snobs she 's always running around with , though Christ knows why . " " You mean you 've got the evening on your hands ? " said Thompson , feigning surprise . " Looks that way . " " So have I. Well , hell 's bells , why do n't we make a night of it ? "   " Suits me fine , " said Mollison , delighted not to be left alone . " How about going around to the Four Arts Club , for dinner and a little serious hoisting ? " " The Four Arts ! I have n't been there in years . " " Neither have I. But I guess some of the old-timers are n't completelyossified yet . " The cool night air refreshed them , and they decided to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long silence , " Ginny is giving me the gate . " " You 're crazy ! " said Thompson . This time he was genuinely surprised ; and not only surprised but strangely excited . " No , I 'm not . I 've seen it coming for a long time . For a while I figured it was because she thought I ought to marry her . But now I 'm sure she would n't marry me if she could . " " She 's probably just on the downbeat , that 's all . They 're all like that . Just baby her along a little and she 'll snap right back . " Mollison shook his head . " I 'd like to believe it , but I 'd only be kiddingmyself . She thinks I 'm not good enough for her any more . Well , maybe she 's right . But the goddam thing of it is that I feel the same way about her that I always did  --  only more so ! " Thompson went on trying to reassure him , yet contemplating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fears . The Four Arts Club was an informal gathering place for writers , artists , publishers , newspapermen , and professional entertainers . It occupiedan entire floor of a building , over a bar-restaurant , from which meals and drinks were sent up . There was a central dining-room , connectingat one end with a cardroom and at the other with a lounge . The single , long table was well filled . Thompson and Mollison were heartily welcomed . Everybody there knew them , either personally or by reputation . There were many who had seen Mollison in Give Them All My Love , and their effusive compliments bolstered his ego . Before long he was joining heartily in the general banter . After dinnerhe allowed himself , with the customary show of reluctance , to be persuaded to entertain the club members in the lounge . With a well-known band leader as accompanist , he stood at the piano and gave imitations of the vaudeville favorites of his youth . He was a firstratemimic and , encouraged by roars of approval , put on a very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiring attention , and the back-thumping and handshaking that rewarded his performances were balm to the wounds Virginia had inflicted.  |p338On  the way back to the Marlborough Thompson clapped Mollison on the shoulder . " That was a great show ! I do n't think I 've ever seen you any better . " Mollison beamed . " Well , they 're a great bunch of guys . I was having the time of my life . Glad you thought of going around there . How about stopping somewhere for a little nightcap ? " " I ca n't . I 'm rehearsing at one , and I 've got a lot of work to do before I go to bed . " Then , as though it were an afterthought , " Oh , what train arc you taking hack ? " Mollison was overcome by embarrassment . After the wonderful evening Thompson had provided it was not easy to tell him of his intention to stay over . " Well , I do n't know , " he said . " I sort of wish I could catch tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it except for that lousy run-through . I think Ginny would like me to stay too . " He watched Thompson 's face covertly . The director showed no sign of disturbance . " I 'm sure she would , " he said . " And so would I. You know how glad I always am to get your reactions . Too bad it ca n't he done . " Mollison summoned his courage . " You do n't think George Hamlincould go on for me  --  just for the one performance ? " Thompson wrinkled his brow and ran his hand through his hair . " Well , I do n't know , Hugh . It would scare the hell out of me to send him on without a rehearsal . I 'd be glad to shoot down there and work with him tomorrow , but the trouble is I 've got this rehearsal here , and I hate to give that up . " " No , no , you ca n't do that ! " said Mollison hastily , feeling that he was behaving like an ingrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sodden despair . " Well , I guess I can pick up a train in the morning . " " I think Doc is taking the twelve-something , " said Thompson , improvisingrapidly . " Why do n't you ride down with him ? He 's always good for a laugh or two . " " He sure is ! " said Mollison , brightening . " What 'll I do , call him ? " " No , I 'll take care of it ; and I 'll have him call you , in the morning , in plenty of time . " " Okay . Oh , wait a minute ! Ginny said something about getting back in time for lunch . " " Well , she wo n't have much time . The rehearsal call is for one . " " Yes , I guess I 'd better skip it and go back with Doc . Well , in case P339I do n't see you in the morning , thanks again for a wonderful evening . " The instant he got back to his room Thompson called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wake you up . " " Another frustrated hope , my boy , " said Winternitz . He was a chronic insomniac and had just dropped off to sleep . " I thought I 'd better tell you that you and a ham named Mollison are taking a noonish train to New York . " " Just a moment , while I put my interpreter on . " He listened resignedlyto Thompson 's explanation , knowing that he would not get to sleep again for hours and not at all happy at being pressed into service as Mollison 's bodyguard . " Keep feeding him and talking to him and goosing him up , " said Thompson in conclusion . " Do anything that 's necessary to get him on tomorrow night . " " I 'll send him a wire informing him of his mother 's death . That has never yet failed to make an actor go on and do his best . " Before going to bed Thompson sent a reassuring night telegram to Claire  --  he had with difficulty dissuaded her from coming back with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have landed and have the situation well in hand . Do n't phone or come back to the hotel beforetwelve . Your loving Uncle Tommy . " When Eric arrived at the theater for the Monday rehearsal Virginiawas already there . Thompson 's telegram had been comforting but not very informative , and she had thought it best not to go to the hotel at all . After satisfying Eric about her health , she again apologizedfor disappointing him and suggested that they have lunch on Thursday and visit the Gardner Museum afterwards . It was the only time she had free . All the while she was talking to him she kept an P340eye out for Thompson . As soon as he came in she excused herself and hurried over to him . He drew her aside and told her that Mollisonwas on his way hack to New York with Winternitz . " You 're a wonder boy ! " said Virginia with genuine admiration . " What is the secret of your success , Mr. Machiavelli ? " " Hard work and complete abstinence from intoxicants , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering what they had to talk about in private and what it was that made her look so joyful . Thompson was in a jolly mood , wasting a great deal of time clowningand telling anecdotes , so that the rehearsal lasted until nearly five . The Monday night audience was not very large , but Thompson was well satisfied with the performance and its reception . He went straight back to the hotel in expectation of a call from Winternitz . At half-past eleven the telephone rang . He was annoyed to hear Lily 's voice . " Can you see me ? " she asked tremulously . " I ca n't leave . I 'm expecting a long-distance call . " " I 'm in the hotel . Could n't I come up for just a minute ? Please say yes . " " Why sure , " he said . He assumed that she was calling from one of the house telephones at the reception desk . If he refused she might begin to weep and attract the attention of people in the lobby . Besides , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angry and troubled , he paced the room , all his self-satisfaction dissipated . The telephone rang again , and this time it was Winternitz . " Hello , Doc . Did you get him on all right ? " " When has Winternitz failed to get anyone on ? " " How was he ? " " A delicate study in equilibrium . What you might call a staggeringperformance . But no disturbing incidents , except for one secondbalconycustomer who was inebriated by the fumes emanating from the stage . " " Nice work , Doc . I guess the worst is over , but I think you 'd betterstay in New York and keep baby 's nose clean till I get back . " " Well , you knows best , boss . " The door buzzer sounded . " I 'll give you a little kiss when I see you . Phone me again tomorrow night , will you ? " He opened the door for Lily . " What are you doing out without a coat ? " he said , looking at her in surprise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As his brows contracted she went on volubly , " I could n't stand that Bay State Hotel another day . My room was right on the street , and I have n't been able to get one night 's sleep . " " Why did n't you ask them to change your room ? " " They did n't have any other one . " She went to him and put her arms around his neck . " Please do n't be angry at me . I 've been so lone-some . " " I 'm not angry , " he said sharply . " How about a drink ? " " No , thank you . " " Well , I think I 'll have one , if you do n't mind . " She sat down while he mixed a highball . He was furious , well aware that she could not afford to stay at the Marlborough and had moved in only to be near him . Yet he could not very well complain , for she had every right to live where she pleased . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank in silence . " Please talk to me , " she said . " It 's days since you 've said a word to me . " " Well , I 'm doing a job here and I 've had a few things on my mind . " " I know that . I know there are lots of things that are more important to you than I am . And I 've tried not to bother you  --  oh , you do n't know how hard I 've tried ! But now that I 'm here , could n't you just be a little nice to me ? " She went over to him and sat on his lap . " I just want to be near you , that 's all . " Mechanically he set down his glass and put his arms around her . She clasped his neck and , murmuring endearments , covered his face with kisses . His sensual nature could not long resist the enticement of her young body , and he soon surrendered to her passionate longing . She wanted to spend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her go back to her room , on the excuse that he still had work to do . He was thoroughly bored with her , yet he had enough pity in him to prevent his telling her the brutal truth . Only a few days remainedbefore their return to New York and once there it would not be so hard to shake her off . The play continued to go well . The indications were that the week 's business would be quite good , until on Wednesday afternoon it began to rain . Not only was the window sale for the Wednesday night performanceaffected , but the advance sale for the remainder of the week fell off sharply . Eric and Virginia had arranged to lunch , on Thursday , at a famous P342sea-food restaurant near the wharves . But Thursday was a raw , gusty day , with the rain coming down in sheets , so they decided to stay in the hotel . The dining-room was not crowded , and they had a leisurely lunch at a secluded table . They discussed the theater and books and pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk about himself , particularly since he thought his own life lacking in interest ; so he encouraged Virginia to tell of her travels and of the things she had seen and done . " I certainly envy you all that , " he said . " I 've never been anywhere or seen anything  --  except Grant 's Tomb and a few Army camps . " " Well , I guess I have been around a little . And I wo n't say it has n't been fun . When I think of Venice and Salzburg , of Chartres and Vezclay and Bruges , of the sun at Juan-les-Pins and the snow peaks of Chamonix , of the high tide breaking over the sea wall at Dinard and skiing at Cortina d'Ampczzo , of bouillebaisse at the Vieux Port in Marseille and pheasant stuffed with sauerkraut in Strasbourg , of the little Flemish and Dutch rooms off the Rubens Gallery in the Louvre and the cloister of Saint Trophime in Arles  --  well , just talking about it like this gives me goose pimples and little wiggles running up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding it all up , I 'm not sure that I would n't swap every bit of it for what you 've had . " Eric laughed . " Growing up on the wrong side of the tracks in a one-horse town ? Working in a factory ? Lying awake nights , wondering how your family would eat if you happened to break a leg  --  or if your play turned out a failure ? Is that what you mean ? " " Well , I do n't know about the factory part of it . I do n't think I 'd ever be much of a hand at a Diesel engine or a cyclotron . Cyclotron , is that right ? But the rest of it , yes . " " You 're not serious , are you ? " said Eric in astonishment . " But so very definitely serious ! " " But why ? " " Because you 've had something that I 've never had and never can have , now . Roots , a place where you belong and are at home , lovingkindnessand warmth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've slept all your life . That nice mother and that nice sister who 's going to have a baby . How is she ? " " She 's fine , " said Eric . " She and my mother are coming to New York for the opening . They 'd love to meet you , I know  --  if you would n't mind , that is . "   " Mind ! Do n't talk like a crazy fool . I 'd adore it . Promise ? " " Yes , of course . " " Good ! Only I know , without meeting them , that you would n't trade them in for a fistful of cathedrals and a ton of caviar . " " Well , no , I guess I would n't . " " You know bloody well you would n't ! Well , that 's what I mean . I was handed everything  --  and nothing . Everything except what really mattered . A great big gold platter , full of emptiness . Snuff and tobaccy and excellent jacky , and scissors and watches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonged anywhere or that anybody cared . My father is an amiable and dishonest old fuddy-duddy and my mother is a high-powered bitch , and I 've never meant any more to either of them than they have to me . I 'm just the accidental product of a careless moment . Nobody ever wanted me and nobody ever knew what to do with me . I was brought up by butlers and stable boys and middle-aged Lesbian schoolteachers . So I had to learn to stand on two sturdy little feet that have carried me around the world without taking me anywhere . And here I am , at an age that I am not revealing , with neither kith nor kin , nor chick nor child , nor where to lay my head . For God 's sake , stop me , will you ? I 'm beginning to sound like Little Orphan Annie or one of the less successful creations of the late Charles Dickens . Will you be kind enough to give me a swift kick in the pants or order me another brandy or both ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , " said Eric , deeply moved by her frankness and sincerity . " Yes , cocktail friends , dressing-room friends , **73;4269;TOOLONG . And if you call memorizing lines in a thing by a Nutmeg State industrial worker a career ! " She leaned over and patted his hand . " A good thing , mark you , but decidedly not my own . " " What do you want ? " " Well , that is what my barrister calls a leading question , I believe . But better tell the doctor everything , Miss Upton . Well , laughable though it may seem , what I really daydream about is tiny garments and a bony shoulder to cry on . " Eric felt himself flushing . " Well , maybe you 'll get them yet . " She shook her head . " Helas , non ! " " Why not ? " " Because I 'm spoiled and selfish and man delights me not  --  no , norP344woman either ! But shut up , Ginny , will you ? Because Ginny is awful sick of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " All the more reason for turning it off in time . How 's about you , little brother ? What do you want ? " " That 's not an easy question . " " Are good ones ever ? " " No , I guess not . All right then . What I want is to know the truth  --  " She craned her neck . " Pardon me , is Pilate in the house ? " " Well , let 's say to try to know the truth and to try to express it in my work . To be as honest as I can , with myself and with others . To fight the destructiveness and possessiveness that 's in me and develop creativeness and self-reliance . To make myself live what I believe , which is that life and not death is the true meaning of life . Is that any kind of an answer to your hard question ? " She nodded several times . " Is good . I like . " There were tears in her eyes . With a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the shoulder would fit in too  --  though not necessarily a bony one . " She sat making crisscross marks on the tablecloth with her ring . " How old are you ? " she asked at last . " Almost twenty-seven . Why ? " " I feel like your grandmother . " " Why ? " he asked again , puzzled and a little hurt . She shook her head . " Do n't know . Just do . " " Do I sound as infantile as all that ? " " Oh , God , no ! " she said , putting her hand on his . " Please do n't think I meant it that way , because I did n't at all . " " Then what ? " " I do n't know . It 's just that I 've always felt like everybody 's grandmother , I guess . I ca n't remember ever feeling really young , or in fact like anything but a little old lady . So rub that hurt look off your big , brown eyes and go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Before Eric could think of an answer , a bellboy entered the dining-room , paging Virginia . She beckoned to him . " Telephone for you , Miss Upton , " said the boy . " Mr. Mollison calling from New York . " With difficulty Virginia kept her composure . " Well , just say P345that  --  " she began , trying to think of some excuse for not talking to Mollison . But , as far as Eric was concerned , the damage had already been done ; she might as well take Mollison 's call , now as later . " I 'll take it in my room . Just ask the operator to hold it until I get up-stairs . " " Yes , miss . " " Will you excuse me , Eric ? " " Yes , of course , " he said , tight-lipped . " Do n't get up , please . You stay here and finish your brandy . " She looked at her watch . " My God , it 's about time I gave you a break ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he took automatically . " Thank you for just about the best time I 've had in I do n't know when . And forgive me for being such a bore . " " You know very well I was n't bored . " " It 's sweet of you to say so anyhow . We 're friends , are n't we ? " she said , pleadingly . " I hope so . " " Well , hold on to that , " she said , seeing that she could not make him unbend . " And let 's break bread again before too long . " Eric watched her go . She turned in the doorway to wave and smile . He slumped into his chair , brooding unhappily . He had believedevery word she had said and had been warmed and thrilled by her apparent confidence in his sympathy and understanding . Yet her relationship to Mollison seemed inconsistent with everything that he conceived her to be and with everything that she had expressed . A few moments before it had all seemed so clear to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely been playing a game with him , using her histrionic talent to create an interesting character , or was she sincere and yet bound to Mollison in some way he did not understand ? In any case , he told himself , it was better to face the facts , no matter how painful they might be , than be lulled into self-deception and false hopes .
