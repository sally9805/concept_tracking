IT is extremely difficult for us to feel as strongly as the Russians do about the Germans . Our country has not been ravaged . We have been taught to be skeptical , even cynical , about atrocities . We remember the debunking of such stories which followed the last war . Some of us suspect that these atrocities are exaggerated or even made up to play on our sympathies . Nothing could be further from the truth . I belong to the postwar generation , a very cynical generation . I also belong to a cynical profession . Almost every day that I spent in the Soviet Union there were fresh atrocity stories in the newspapers . We rarely went on a trip toward the front that we did n't hear about Nazi barbarities or see the results of German viciousness . Aftcr a while , like other correspondents , I became calloused to such things . We even had the feeling that no matter how many people were massacred the story was " old , " or not " news . " But after I attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the Germans . W E FLEW down from Moscow to Kharkov . It was a gray day with a low ceiling and the plane went above church-steeple level only to avoid church steeples . When we arrived it was stillonly midmorning . We went straight from the airport to the Ukrainian Musical Comedy Theater on Rymarskaya Street , where the trial was being held . The theater was old and smelly . The central auditorium was packcd with a thousand spectators , many of them standing . Tickets to the proceedings went to wounded Red Army men , front-line heroes on leave , outstanding production workers , and families of Kharkov citizens who had been slaughtered by the Germans during the occupation . The design of the theater was baroque , and white-sculptured nymphs arched against the upper boxes like so many little daughters of Atlas supporting the world . Despite the seriousness of the occasion , the setting seemed like a Hollywood premiere ? klieg lights , microphones , cameras , celebrities , and photographers . Perhaps the courtroom of the Hauptmann trial in Flemington , New Jersey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a box at the left , just opposite the prisoners ' box . Prominent Soviet writers had boxes behind ours . On one door was a printed sign which read simply , " ToLs-rot . " That rotund writer appeared presently . When a photographer shot off a flash bulb in his face he cursed him out just as a grand duke might have done thirty years before . Only the photographer talked right back ? a big difference . " Death in battle is too easy a death for their crimes , " Tolstoi wrote in Pravda when the trial of three Nazis and one traitor opened . " Hitler freed the Germans from moral feelings of pity , nobleness , honor , and respect for man , but we have n't freed the Germans from their obligation to be men . . . Today Kharkov began the first trial which opens a whole epoch of great and dreadful judgment for the Germans who have overstepped the laws of humanity . Today three Germans are being tried among the ruins of the town , surrounded by the tombs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but like bandits , torturers , licentious half-men . . . . " MHE " licentious half-men " took their seats in their box . The trial was resuming . There were sneezes in the audience . Girls focused opera glasses and others craned their necks to see the four accused men . The Germans were all in uniform . Captain Wilhelm Langheld , fifty-two , a Nazi counterespionage officer , sat straight and correct . He was clean-shaven with a long , puffy-pink face , thin lips , and slick red hair . Reinhard Retslau , a member of the German secret police , had a bored expression , a chinless face , and spectacles . He sat very calmly and seemed to be listening to the testimony in Russian as well as the translation into German . He was thirty-six years old and wore a medal which Hitler had given him two years before . Lieutenant Hans Ritz , twenty-four , had a gnomelike head with a large skull , a sharp German nose , a caved-in chest , and a silly mustache . He was an assistant commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canes and rubber hoses , and in , June , 1943 , he had taken part in a mass shooting of Soviet civilians near Kharkov . Mikhail Bulanov , called by one of the Russian writers " the black lining of the blue German uniform , " was a Russian traitor . His black eyebrows had grown together over his closely set , black sneaky eyes . He looked like a jackal . The trials were being run by the military tribunal of the Fourth Ukrainian Front . The chief judge was Major General Miasnikov . The defense counsel , appointed by the judge , was N. V. Kommodov , who is the Soviet Union 's Samuel Liebowitz with a bit of Clarence Darrow thrown in . He had two assistants , S. K. Krasnacheyev and N. P. Belov . Both lawyers were well known . The prosecutor was N. K. Dounaev , a young Red Army colonel . The accused made no objections to the judges or the defense lawyers . The testimony thus far had been incredible . The Germans , pretty sure that they were going to die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life imprisonment if they made a clean breast of things . They knew , too , that there was not much point in hiding facts . The Soviets had volumes of proof , cemeteries full of evidence . The accused had only to look into the eyes of the crowd at the trial to realize the hopelessness of claiming innocence . Langheld , a veteran of World War I , had related in his cold , expressionless voice how he beat women and starved prisoners without thinking of good or bad . He was almost the dramatic monologist or raconteur telling how he flogged an innocent young Soviet woman while her small son cringed in a corner watching his mother being tortured . Langheld said he beat the woman until she was covered with blood . She fainted . Next day she died . And what happened to the child ? Oh , Langheld had forgotten that part momentarily . The child refused to be torn away from the dead body of the mother . That 's why they shot him . The audience listened in quiet horror . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was businesslike , accurate , choosing his words as if he were talking about a grocery store where certain foods had spoiled . They asked him , " How many innocent people have you personally killed or tortured ? " He lifted his piggish little eyes to the ceiling , mentally counting . Then he replied like a bank clerk . To his regret he could not say definitely at the moment , but approximately he had shot , tortured , or otherwise destroyed , say , a hundred people . The Soviet writers hated Langheld more than they did the others . They could n't forget that he had been a British prisoner of war in 1917 and had been allowed to return home to resume his career all over again . The sharp-tongued David Zaslaysky wrote about him , " Langheld is Hitler reduced to the scale of one torture chamber . " Prim prosecutor was making his long 11. summation . The newsreelmen took their pictures . Retslau kept staring at the speaker . Bulanov , in his black turtleneck sweater , looked terribly uneasy . Ritz had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shivered occasionally as he felt the vindictiveness in the prosecutor 's voice . Langheld seemed completely unmoved as if he were at a lecture on the weaving methods of the Navajo Indians and not at a trial where his life was in the balance . Often he closed his eyes or stifled a yawn . The prosecutor paused to drink some hot tea . Then he continued , " The men who are in the dock are not responsible ; we know who they are and they will have to answer . We try these three for their personal crimes , for what they have done with their own hands . . . . " He began to picture their crimes . He re-created scenes in which little children , thinking they were going for a joy ride , hopped into German vans . They turned out to be the notorious gas wagons or doushagoopkas . In them the children , with or without their parents , were asphyxiated by carbon monoxide while the van was already on its way toward some dumping ground . There was sniffling among the spectators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to keep clearing lumps from their throats . " Retslau , " charged the prosecutor , " is a professional killer . The Red Army stopped his career . You judges must decide his future . . . " Next he delved into the triumphs of Ritz . " He wanted to get into the Gestapo because it was nice and comfortable and the first outfit to run away when there 's danger . " Ritz was the type who liked to have his picture taken hanging innocent women and children and then send it back to his mother and sweetheart . For Bulanov , the prosecutor reserved his special scorn . He was a deserter from the Red Army . He had helped repair doushagoopkas . He had even driven them . Near the end of the summation , the prosecutor struck a Tom Dewey pose . " The crimes are proved not only of those sitting in the dock but of all those who will be ! " he shouted . " For our mothers , wives , daughters , sisters ? in their names , the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " There was a storm of applause . lI AN T , HAD lunch with Tolstoi , Kon- stantin Simonov , Ehrenburg , and Dmitri Kudriavtsev , Secretary of the Soviet Union 's Atrocity Commission . When it was over we returned to hear Defense Attorney Kommodov make his final plea . He is the man who defended the Trotskyist bloc in the 1936-37 treason trials . Kommodov began talking slowly , analyzing the specific structure of fascism . He showed how its very nature breeds war and brutality . In all epochs there are atrocities , he pointed out , but none can compare with this planned , regular annihilation of a peaceful people . " I shall not recount all the terrors committed by the Germans , having respect for your nerves . " He spoke without notes , a glass of tea held in his left hand . Once , when he read a quotation from Stalin , he put on his glasses . The burden of his plea resembled the one the defense lawyer made in Richard Wright 's Native Son : That the crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived . When he had finished , a translator began reading the speech in German . Ritz sobbed as he listened to it . The others seemed unmoved . Then , one by one , the accused made their last pleas . They sang echoes of Kommodov 's tune , but with less effect . Retslau said it was useless to hide his crimes . He blamed German propaganda , which said the Russians were torturing German prisoners , cutting off their hands . " I can say the opposite is true . We were well treated in prison . " He asked the judges to consider his background and training under the Nazi system . Lang-held dozed as Retslau asked to be spared . He wanted to return to Germany and prove himself by his deeds . Shortly after six all the Red Army guards were changed , and the court announced that the curfew was being suspended for the evening , so the crowd could stay . The next to speak was the hopeless Bulanov . Wiwi the Germans had taken him prisoner he had had the choice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brave Soviet people preferred heroic death . But he , Bulanov , had no such high moral character . He asked the judges to imagine his feelings among the " German cannibals . " He got only ninety occupation marks per month for his work . He said his guilt was tremendous , but he certainly hoped he could be used by the Soviets in some way ; he would prove himself by hard work and good intentions . VV HEN Langheld stood in front of the microphone the crowd stirred noisily and the judge rapped for order . The Prussian kept his hands behind his back . The klieg lights were switched on . Lang-held blinked , faltered as he tried to speak . " I have nothing to add to the formal accusation , " he said . " I beat prisoners ; they were beaten under my orders ; they were shot by my orders . I ask only one consideration . I am not alone . The entire German army is like that , too . I do not mean to cover up my own guilt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Hitler regime has managed to suppress the generous feelings of the German people and to bring out the beastly instincts . This is especially true in the Wehrmacht . This evil has shown itself particularly during this war . To contradict or not to fulfill the orders we were given meant to sentence ourselves to death . And I was a victim of these orders . I ask consideration for my old age , and because I told the truth in the preliminary hearings . " I looked at the audience . There was no sympathy , only hatred . Ritz swayed as he stood up . He sounded like a whining boy . " I do n't want to implore you , I do n't want to blot out my crimes , " he said . " It 's unworthy of me as a man and a soldier . I wish to speak with frankness . . . I want you to know that I did not relish killings . If so , I would have takenpart in many more crimes , as I had plenty of chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army forced me to do it . . . . I was under orders when I committed crimes , under the sentence of death my-. self if I did not carry out these orders . " He sighed . Then he began again . " The Hitler system is directed not only against other nations but against German people who do not obey him . Consider my life . I was a child of thirteen when the Hitler regime came to power . Since then I have been systematically educated . " Ritz was something of an orator , and used his hands for gestures . I could not get all his testimony , but this is approximately correct : " I am young and / have my life before me . I want to live so I can testify against the other SS men who ordered these atrocities . . . . " The court recessed at 9:15 P.M. We drove back to the hotel and had supper . About 11:30 a telephone call came that the judges were ready to announce their decision . We entered the packed hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The judges walked in from the wings . As they appeared on the stage everyone stood up , the Red Army men rigidly at attention . For the first time I noticed the light blue velvet curtain behind the judges , and the pretty Red Army girl court clerks . At exactly 11:55 General Masnikov read the findings of the court and the verdict : " Death by hanging . " The audience applauded . Then a Red Army lieutenant read the same thing in German . Bulanov ducked his head down . Ritz looked incredulous . Retslau tapped his thick fingers against the frames of his horn-rimmed glasses . Langheld betrayed nothing . The guards led them out . I asked Ehrenburg when they would be hanged . " Sunday morning , " he snapped back . " What better time ? Tomorrow . " On the way out of the theater I stopped to read a big billboard . It said , literally , " NEXT WEEK-ROSE-MARIE . " SUNDAY morning was overcast but not too cold . Naturally one of the Americans , taking a deep breath of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging . " Nobody laughed . We piled into cars and went to see the end . If the scene had been in a movie it would have jarred me by its savagery and unreality . Fitted into the context of time and place it had a stark but entirely believable reality . Around us Kharkov kids were scampering high on the snowy rooftops of shattered , windowless buildings . Nearby the great Kharkov cathedral , damaged by Nazi bombs , stood empty . About fifty thousand people dressed in their shabby Sunday best shoved into the enormous open market square . They were held in check by Red Army guards with fixed bayonets and low-slung tommy guns . In the dismal gray light of that chilly December morning loomed four gaunt fifteen-foot gallows ? stout wooden beams with strong , thin nooses drooping from crossbars . Beneath the rigid nooses four open Chevrolet trucks were backed up . On each truck were three flimsy unpainted wooden tables . Overhead two trim Lend-Lease Airacobras and a pair of ugly Russian U-2s hovered like vultures . Behind us a half-demolished office building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rafters were black with spectators . Photographers fought for vantage points . One newsreel crew was located on a platform twenty feet high opposite the gallows . At 11:15 A.M. two cars plowed through the dense crowd . The first contained military and judicial officials . The sec-ond was a closed gray-green truck with guards and the condemned . The door was opened . The crowd stirred impa-tiently . With their hands tied behind them the Germans , Hans Ritz , Wilhelm Langheld , and Reinhard Retslau , were led out , followed by the Russian traitor , Mikhail Bulanov . The crowd surged for-ward , straining against the cordon of guards , despite whose efforts the circle around the gallows tightened . Red Army men helped each of the con-demned onto a truck beneath the coiled rope . Then they assisted each man 's re-luctant feet onto the center table while two guards flanked him on the side tables . The necks of the condemned reached the empty nooses . The Germans were in full uniform with epaulets and ribbons . They wore forage caps . Langheld had on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motors of the four one-ton trucks coughed , then roared . Major General Miasnikov , chairman of the mili-tary tribunal , mounted the rostrum im-provised from packing cases . His voice over the loudspeaker system seemed to come from far off as he repeated the court 's sentence . Then the General paused dra-matically before he barked out the order : " Lieutenant Colonel , fulfill the ver-dict . " The trucks lurched forward several yards . The gathering let out an involuntary screech like the escape valve of an over-heated boiler . Momentarily they broke forward . Four bodies , three in the dirty gray-green Nazi field uniform , swayed slightly . Death was surprisingly quick and simple . A threaded through the throng I could see no expression of horror , no remorse on their faces . After witnessing the courtroom trial and watching the spectators I had not really expected to find horror and remorse . The people of Kharkov had lived with terror and tragedy for so long under the Germans that the sight of three Nazi barbarians and one traitor hanging cold and dead on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no shock . For the people of Kharkov it was only the prologue of a new drama , not the climactic scene of an old one . This was one of the small moments of justice , their first satisfaction under law for months of unlawful brutality . I asked a Red Army lieutenant how long the bodies would hang . " Three days and three nights , " he said . " Let Hitler shake and tremble in his bomb shelter . " Examining the strong-lined faces of these Ukrainians , you knew instinctively that they would never put down their arms until total victory was won ; that they would never forget the one hundred thousand Kharkov citizens who starved to death under the Nazis . Talking with them about " what it was like , " I realized that in every head there is a kind of projector constantly throwing slides on memory 's screen : scenes of thousands of women and children being tortured , their lives snuffed out in the gas wagons . . of rubber hosing and machine guns cutting down defiant old men like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of digging graves and being shoved in , sometimes alive . . of the mass slaughter of the Jews . . . of barbed wire and bayonets ripping a tattoo on honest flesh . And if these scenes ever faded , the people only had to gaze about them . There was always their beloved Kharkov , a living tableau of Nazi artistic achievement ? the once handsome , thriving Kharkov which they had built with their own labor , now broken , twisted , wrecked . The Red Army lieutenant followed me back to the car . The crowd was scattering , slowly . The officer said to me , echoing the prosecutor at the trial : " Their names are Langheld , Ritz , and Retslau . But in our hearts it is Hitler , Himmler , and Goering echo are hanging there today . " Before I could find suitable words for a reply , a red-faced old babushka who had overheard the Lieutenant 's declaration mumbled what all of us were thinking . She said , " Skaro budyet ? soon it will be . " IV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , several of us walked around the town . Eventually we went back to the market square , where little booths and stalls were open and doing a flourishing trade . I stopped and bought a secondhand chainik ( teapot ) for forty rubles . It was n't worth more than 20 cents at Woolworth 's , but there is no Woolworth 's in Kharkov or anywhere else in Russia . And it was the first teapot I 'd seen for sale anywhere at any price in the Soviet Union . Five minutes after I had bought it another correspondent came along looking for one . There were n't any more . He offered me sixty rubles for mine . Despite my capitalist instincts I resisted the profit . The four bodies were still hanging in the center of the square . Only a few latecomers were looking at the bluish corpses . The three Germans had lost their forage caps . And Langheld was already minus his fine high boots . In Russia boots are boots whether they belong to dead Germans or anyone else . You take them where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a cruel sense of humor was trying to slick a lighted cigarette into Bulanov 's mouth . When a Red Army man shouted something at him he sprinted away . We continued walking around the market . Somebody bought an old map in German . There were also German oil paints for sale , and German textbooks , and a sorry collection of Christmas ornaments , including some frayed silver tinsel and a few large red balls . An old woman at another stall was selling empty German bottles with strange and wonderful labels ? champagne from France , port from Spain , cognac from Poland . About fifteen minutes later we left the market place . It was still crowded with Sunday strollers and shoppers and buyers . But nobody was paying any attention to the four bodies . A. Russian photographer for PraLcla who was with our sightseeing group said : " This must be very hard for you to understand . " Then he went on quickly , " It 's not that people have no feelings ; it 's because they have feelings . The business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the chance to buy things  - -  can you imagine what that means to them ? When the Germans were here they did n't dare to sell anything for fear the Germans would grab it . Of course there is n't much here , but it seems like much to them . Do you think this is bad ? What is your opinion ? " I said I understood . " I have bought a chainik , " I said , tapping the bulge in my coat pocket . The cameraman sighed . " It can not be a very good chainik . The Germans would not have left it behind . " As we neared the hotel he asked again , " Are you sure you understand how the people feel ? " " Yes . " Then I said , " This is a nice hotel . " " Not very , " he said , " You should have been here before the war . " " I was . I was here in 1935 . " He brightened considerably . " Then you do understand , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we went up the stairs toward our rooms he had another thought and he said to me , " But your home is in America . It is safe . Have you perhaps lost someone in the war ? " I said no . " Then you only understand a little , just a drop . " Then he seemed to be afraid he had hurt my feelings and he squeezed my arm . " You will forgive me . Even if you are very sensitive ? just a drop . " I thought he was wrong then . It was n't until months later , when I saw the Maidanek " murder camp " in Poland that I thought of him again and realized that he was quite right . People like me could understand only " just a drop . "
