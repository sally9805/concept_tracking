txt CIO RALLY CHEERS ATTACK ON TRUMAN President Assailed as ' No. 1 Strike-Breaker ' ? Fight on Labor Bills Started Fighting mad at President Truman 's anti-strike program , .1,170 representatives of Congress of Industrial Organizations unions in this city cheered yesterday an attack on the President as " the No. 1 strikebreaker of the American bankers and railroads . " They pledged vengeance at the polls against Congressional supporters of the Truman legislative proposals . What had been planned as an all-day conference of CIO leaders and shop stewards at the Henry Hudson Hotel to discuss political action and organizational activities was converted into a forum for denunciation of the President . Joseph Curran , president of the National Maritime Union and of the Greater New York CIO Council , told the delegates that the strike of 200,000 seamen and longshoremen scheduled for June 15 I would go on " regardless of what kind of repressive legislation they pass in Congress , " unless the workers won their demands for higher pay , shorter hours and improved working conditions . The bitterest criticism of the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Transport Workers Union , who accused Mr. Truman of having committed " treason " against the American people and of having submitted his anti-strike program // " under instructions from American fascists . " " It is unfortunate we got President Truman in the first place as the result of an accident , " Mr. ' Quill declared . " Truman has committed treason against the people of the United States . Yesterday it was the railroad workers and unless we act quickly it will be the maritime workers tomorrow and the auto and steel workers in a week or two . He has become the No. 1 strike-breaker of the American bankers and railroads . In one fifteen-minute speech to Congress he did more to break labor than the Pinkertons and Pearl Bergoffs did in seventy years . " Delegation to Go to Capital After vigorously applauding Mr. Quill 's remarks , the conference unanimously adopted a resolution asserting that passage of the Truman proposals would " turn back the clock of progress and democracy in human relations by 100 years . " The resolution called upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was approved by Congress . A delegation of several hundred unionists was recruited to go to Washington on a 7:30 o'clock train this morning to buttonhole members of the Senate and arouse sentiment against the enactment of curbs on labor . Hyman Blumberg , State secretary of the American Labor party , urged the CIO leaders not to be swept into the mood of " hysteria " set by the President and lose their faith in the effectiveness of democratic processes . Instead of taking the attitude that there was nothing further to be gained through action at the polls , workers should express their resentment against the President 's program by redoubling their efforts in the political field , Mr. Blumberg said . Speaking in behalf of Sidney Hillman , national chairman of the CIO Political Action Committee , who was kept away from the conference by illness , Mr. Blumberg said he was confident Senator James M. Mead would vote against the legislative restraints proposed by Mr. Truman . Senator Mead is the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination for Governor , and it is generally conceded that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have Labor party support . Dewey 's Course Criticized Mr. Blumberg criticized Governor Dewey for alerting the State Guard in connection with the railroad strike and for declaring that " Washington was not doing enough " in the strike crisis . " Putting men to work at the point of a bayonet is not enough for Tom Dewey , " the ALP official said . " 1 suppose he would not feel enough was being done unless some labor leaders were disposed of entirely . " An assertion that the Labor party would poll 1,000,000 votes in New York State this year was made by Mr. Quill , who added that he did not see " how in the name of God we can support any candidate for public office who voted in the House or will vote in the Senate for Truman 's labor-busting bill . " Calling for an end to labor support of candidates " who play both sides of the street , " the transit union leader urged that increasing stress be placed on independent labor action in politics . This advocacy of third party tactics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In announcing that the maritime strike would be held in spite of any restrictions Congress might impose , Mr. Curran , who presided , made a caustic reference to the conference Secretary of Labor Lewis B. Schwellenbach has called for Wednesday in an effort to avert the walkout . " I do n't doubt , " he said , " that the great pressures of the Cabinet room will be upon us . Everyone who goes in comes out with bayonet marks . " The delegates sent messages to A. F. Whitney , president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen , and Alvanley Johnston , president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers , pledging support to the railroad workers in their campaign for an eight-hour day and improved working conditions . They also sent a cablegram to the All-India Railwaymen 's Federation endorsing the strike set by members of that union in India for June 26 . The message was authorized after Malik Fazal Elahi Qurban , vice president of the Indian union , had told the conference that the Indian railway workers earned 35 cents for a nine-hour day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more money .
