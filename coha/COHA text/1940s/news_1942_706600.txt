txt The war revenue bill was reported formally today by the Ways and Means Committee with a revised estimate of $6,144,000,000 as the yield , but a minority report signed by Representative Knutson , who said that Chairman Doughton concurred in his views , declared that the measure had been arrived at through " a series of trades and shameless log-rolling . " The minority report was made public just after Mr. Knutson confered with Mr. Doughton , who gave an indication of his views last night by saying that he had not participated in any " trades . " The majority report , said to have been concurred in by nearly all the members , pointed to the heavy burden that war had placed upon Federal income and emphasized that " the national credit will be subjected to a severe strain . " Yield " Small by Comparison " " With deficit and debt figures of such magnitude , " the majority report said , " the yield from the bill seems small by comparison . It should be pointed out , however , that since 1939 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual revenue by about $6,000,000,000 . The present bill increases this figure to more than $12,000,000,000 of additional revenue since 1939 . " For the fiscal year 1939 , Federal tax collections were about $5,500,000,000 . For the fiscal year 1943 , with the revenue added by the bill , Federal tax collections will exceed $21,000,000,000 , and for a full year of operation under the bill , will total $23,000,000,000 . This sum , when added to the annual tax revenues of the States and local governments of approximately $9,000,000,000 , will make the total tax bill of the American people about $32,000,000,000 annually , or almost one-third of the present national income . " It is thus apparent that our revenue needs are extreme and your committee have endeavored to secure every dollar of additional revenue which , in its opinion , the national economy can bear . In its effort toward this objective , however , care has been exercised in every instance not to place an unbearable burden upon any taxpayer . In this respect the additional burdens of the increased rates in existing taxes and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill is designed to yield in a full year of operations immediate additional revenue of $6,144,000,000 . Of this increased revenue , it is estimated that approximately $4,026,000,000 will be received during the fiscal year 1943 . Of the $6,144,000,000 of additional revenue to be raised by the bill , nearly $5,386,000,000 is to be derived from corporate and individual taxpayers and about $758 , - 000,000 from miscellaneous internal revenue taxes . " Knutson Fears for Corporations Mr. Knutson in his minority report said he did not believe the bill was in keeping ' with sound taxation , and that it meant " the death warrant " for many corporations . He went on : " Let us look at the picture . Contrary to popular belief , the corporations of America are today carrying their full share of the tax load . The present law raises from corporations 7,937 millior dollars to which the bill now before us will add an additional 2,428 million dollars , asking a total of 10,365 million dollars . In addition to this heavy Federal tax , American corporations now pay to the States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , State property taxes of 580 million dollars , making a grand total of 11 , - 512 million dollars . " In increasing the normal and surtaxes from 31 per cent to 45 per cent , the Committee , in the opinion of competent economists and , business men , has signed the death warrant of thousands and thousands of small corporations who are injured rather than aided by the war . The unemployment that will result from these small corporations being put out of business will be beyond calculation . " I have no concern for the small number of big companies that are waxing fat from war contracts , but I have tremendous concern for the thousands and thousands of small companies scattered over the length and breadth of the land that give employment to millions of people and sustain our American economy . " They are the backbone of our whole economic structure , and yet the Ways and Means Committee has reported out a bill that will force many to close their doors ; others to discontinue paying dividends , which , in turn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very livelihood depends upon this return . " Some will argue ' Let the Senate put the figure back to where it belongs , ' but we can not shirk our responsibilities . It is our duty to write the very best sort of a tax bill that is possible and this we have failed to do . " It is no longer a secret that the present formula was arrived at through a series of trades and shameless log-rolling . In all my years on the Ways and Means Committee I have never seen anything like it . I realize , as you all do , that we must have a revenue bill , but when the thousands and thousands who will be thrown out of employment as a result of the operation of this measure come to an understanding of the reason for their being out of work , I am afraid some members of the committee will have some explaining to do . " The bill in the final form reported by the committee runs to 320 pages . Most of the wordage reflects the committee 's decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most of which were proposed by the Treasury Department . The main provisions approved were in three categories . The first had to do with corporations . The committee recommended a normal rate of 24 per cent and a surtax of 21 per cent , to make the total " take " 45 per cent . The excess profits rate was fixed at 871,4 per cent . The second concerned individual incomes . The exemption for married couples was lowered from $1,500 to $1,200 and that for single persons from $750 to $500 . No change was made as to the $400 exemption for dependents . But the surtax was increased from 6 per cent in the lowest bracket to 13 per cent , and it ranges to 82 per cent for the highest bracket . The third category was the excise tax field , and in that connection it will be recalled that the committee failed to recommend a sales tax . Rates of many of the commodities now taxed were raised appreciably , but the committee decided not to recommend any increases for gasoline , tobacco or cigarettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was voted down . Secretary Morgenthau had recommended a bill which would raise $8,700,000,000 . The committee 's estimate of $6,144,000,000 was disputed by Mr. Doughton , who said that his long experience on the committee indicated to him that the bill would yield about $7,000 , - 000,000.
