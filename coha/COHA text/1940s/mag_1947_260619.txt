He had an understandable horror of his own bamboo-jointed name : Horst Rdiger Karl August Ernst Georg Cristoph Fabious von Gugel Brandt und Dippolsdorf . True , it showed his patrician lineage , but it would never squeeze into a corner of his surrealist canvases . So he reduced it to plain Rolf Gugel . Plain Rolf 's name is being heard often these days in Germany . <P> Like Salvador Dali , Gugel is perfectly capable of producing art , when he chooses to , that makes sense to everyone , with universal significance , and a craftsmanship that everyone can applaud . Unlike Dali , he often does . And he can duplicate old sculptures and paintings . He makes his living that way . When the baroque church at Diessen decided recently to replace its nine missing Stations of the Cross , Gugel was chosen to do the job . The three he has finished so far are indistinguishable from those made 200 years ago . But he would rather illustrate his Catholicism in his own way . And now , at 37 , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a surrealist altar triptych and Stations of the Cross for a tiny Catholic hill chapel in Bavaria . <P> " I was always a surrealist at heart , " Gugel says , " When I was a child I drew all kinds of transformations . Things like Daphne turning into a tree , and Actaeon into a stag . Surrealism is a very beneficial revolution in painting . It results in conscious exploitation of elements which used to be overlooked because of bourgeois shame . " <P> To illustrate what he means , Gugel waves a sheaf of his drawings of the Cinderella story : a Fairy Godmother in the form of a tablecloth with eyes and feathers , dangling a spider ; a cast-iron Cinderella flagging down an old-fashioned locomotive ( see cut ) with clocks for wheels , representing her father . <P> It would take a Freudian to detect what shame-free message Gugel has thus found in Cinderella , but churchgoers will be likely to find his surrealist chapel disturbing . By last week Gugel had completed the two side panels for the altar . One of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keel , with its sail tattered and twisted about half a face . The title : " Resurrection " ( see cut ) . The other panel , " Martyrdom , " was even more obscure . It consisted of a mask , a bloody accordion , and some high-heeled shoes in the snow .
