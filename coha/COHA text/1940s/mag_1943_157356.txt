Last week President Roosevelt 's envoy to India , William Phillips , announced that he had asked British permission to see India 's imprisoned Mohandas K. Gandhi and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru , and that the permission had been refused . India 's Viceroy , the Marquess of Linlithgow , took Phillips on a tiger hunt instead .
