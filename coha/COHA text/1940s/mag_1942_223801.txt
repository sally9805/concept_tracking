The Navy accepted for tests last week a small , light , glass-roofed truck which may save thousands of dollars , weeks and months of time , and many a trained man lost in navigation training . The truck teaches Naval Air cadets all they need to know about aerial navigation while cruising on the ground . Inside the truck are a desk , books , charts , maps , a position finder , and two standard drift indicators . The truck makes use of the fact that if the drift indicator is set parallel to a course , as in flight , each deviation from that course on a twisting highway will give an effect of drift . The flying student simply plots his course-a straight line on a map - takes findings as he goes along , reports to the driver how far off the course he is and gives him the necessary correction . If the student 's navigation is not sound , he does not fetch up against a mountain peak as he might in a plane . <P> The training truck is the inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tex . Driving along a dark highway one night several months ago , Hagner began to wonder where he was in relation to the spreading , whirling universe . From this random wonder came the idea for the Hagner Mobile Navigation Trainer . Hagner is also the inventor of the Hagner Position Finder and the Hagner Sextant , which are standard equipment in the U.S. Air Forces and Navy and among aerial navigators all over the world . <P> Inventor Hagner did not learn a lick of navigation during his five youthful years in the Navy . His scientific career began when friends twitted him for being an ex-sailor who could not navigate the ketch they were sailing across the Gulf of Mexico . Hagner , who left school at the eighth grade , began to study . The idea for his position finder came to him in a flash one day . The instrument is so simple that it seems absurd that none of the world 's eminent technicians had thought of it before . The model which Hagner took to Wright Field in 1931 ( where it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hayden Planetarium in New York City . <P> When Hagner demonstrated his position finder to the Navy , one of the officers observed : " If you want to do something for your country , invent a sextant without a bubble . " Hagner went to work . In 1939 he perfected his sextant . Besides eliminating the elusive artificial horizon provided by the bubble , the Hagner sextant also provides a permanent record of its findings . Army &; Navy men say it is a thousand times faster , three times as accurate as other sextants.
