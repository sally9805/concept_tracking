txt The young people of Youth the British Commonwealth and whom Princess Elizabeth War singled out in her birthday greeting are of her own age class . In the main the young men must have been untouched by the war in the sense of coming under fire on the battlefield . When the fighting stopped just about two years ago the 19-year-olds were being readied for the ordeal in Britain as here at home . Of course , that may be interpreting Elizabeth 's words too literally ? " the young men and women who were born about the same time as myself . " The young men born a year or two earlier than the Princess were old enough for the supreme test in the last year of the war . But on the whole the Youth young people were still After growing up " in the terrible War and glorious years of the Second World War , " and it is only now that they are beginning " to take some of the burdens from the shoulders of our elders , who fought , worked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words wo have quoted there is a Churchillian rhythm which apparently survives a change of party governments , even as British foreign policy is accused by many of its critics of continuing remarkably the same under political and social change . The question remains whether the boys and girls of Elizabeth 's age class , when they are ten years older , will remember the Second World War as both glorious and terrible . Or will they remember only the horror of it ? Still n- ore , it concerns the boys and girls who will be 21 years of age ten and fifteen years from now . What will their feelings be about the Second World War ? If the thinking of - the The college generation of 1960 Oxford is like that of the British Pledge college generation of approximately 1934 ; if the young people of 1960 remember only the bitter price exacted by the Second World War and choose to forget the causes for- which the war was fought , it does not look so well for a world made safe against aggressors . For it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Oxford Oath , a movement which found its echoes on our American campuses . The historians who write the story of British " appeasement " in the era before the Second World War are bound to ask  --  and indeed people have already been asking  --  how much British youth may have done to encourage Hitler 's plans when British students took a solemn pledge never again to fight for king and country . , Henry A. Wallace , Will preaching against the Aggressors menace of war , has Understand ? met with exceptionally fervid acclaim from an organizatien of British students . It is hard not to let the mind go back to that time a dozen years ago when pacifism apparently swept the ranks of British youth  --  and in less than half a dozen years these young men were in the armed services , fighting against a menace to their very existence which they may have helped in considerable part to invite . If Hitler felt that , he was not repeating William II 's error when he decided that Britain would never fight , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for peace at any price , as Hitler thought , lout British youth was preaching non-resistance . Only after the event did the legend grow up - which Made British appeasement synonymous with Neville Chamberlain 's umbrella and the Cliveden Set . A subsidiary youth When problem in the years Youth ahead of us , but of conLingers siderable importance , will be the need for a working definition of how old is Youth . In the past we have found Youth to be a term of remarkable flexibility , at both ends of the scale . Boys and girls entered the ranks of youth at a very early age and a good many people lingered in the youth classification for a surprising stay , like visitors who insist in staying till all hours of the night . This country had 11 . Migratory Youth problem in the bad economic days of the early Thirties . The problem shrank noticeably when closer scrutiny revealed that a very considerable number of our unemployed and wandering young people were over 25 years of age . Still , Migratory Youth was an improvement over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's unhappy war and civil war orphans of that time . A homeless " child " of near 30 years was a not unknown case here at home . Princess Elizabeth Elderly comes of age at 21 , Youth which is the voting age Movements in Britain and in this ? country , except in Georgia , where it is 18 ; there is a movement to bring it down to 18 in other states . It is a figure which reminds us that teen-agers are by no means synonymous with bobby-soxers . Boys and girls in the upper teens are freshmen and sophomores in college . Many more , perhaps three million boys and girls from 16 through 19 , are in the labor force . If we say that Youth is from 15 to 25 we shall have a fairly good working definition . It should help us , among other things , to appraise " youth movements " inspired and guided by much older and much shrewder persons .                    @
