txt CONFEREES AGREE Back Flexible Price Pegs as Long-Range Rule and a High Floor in Interim ' MUST ' BILLS CLEAR SENATE Minimum . Wage Rise and the $15,585,863,498 for Armed I Forces Sent to President By JOHN D. MORRIS Special to The Naw Yoga Trans . WASHINGTON , Oct. 18 ? A Senate-House conference committee agreed unanimously today on a compromise Farm Bill embodying the principle of flexible price supports as a long-range peacetime policy but assuring high props during a transitory period . The settlement , which cleared away the last major obstacle to quick adjournment of Congress , is expected to receive prompt ratification by the House and Senate . The compromise is also said to be , acceptable to President Truman . Rapid Senate action on several other " must " bills brightened prospects for completion tomorrow of the first session of the Eightyfirst Congress . Measures increasing the minimum wage and appropriating $15,585,863,498 for the Department of Defense went to the White House , and the $1,314,010,000 foreign arms aid program ' was brought to a point where it was expected to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point bill , which had threatened to delay adjournment , was set aside until January . In Good Moot on Farm Bill The Farm Bill conferees , deadlocked since last Friday in their attempts to adjust differences between the Senate 's Anderson bill and the House 's Gore bill , announced their agreement at the end of a long morning meeting behind closed doors . Most of them were present for a news conference at which the settlement was outlined , and a spirit of high satisfaction and good-will was evident in contrast to the angry mood in which previous sessions had ended . Democratic members were especially pleased over their success in. closing what had been regarded as a politically dangerous split among top leaders over the issue of continued high , rigid price supports versus a lower flexible system geared to peacetime economic conditions . The fight , centering in the Senate , had raised tears of some party strategists that the Republicans might recapture the farm vote next year . Senators Scott W. Lucas of Illinois , the majority leader , and Clinton P. Anderson of New Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led the forces trying to establish a flexible system . Most other Senate Democrats , backed by President Truman and Vice President Barkley , favored continuation of high , rigid supports for basic commodities . Today 's settlement appeared to have assured enactment of a bill bearing a Democratic label , behind I which both camps could rally in campaigning for farmers ' votes . If ' the conferees had failed to agree , a Republican support program enacted last year was to take effect next Jan. 1 . Sponsored by Senator George D. Aiken , Republican , of Vermont , that law contains a flexible support formula less liberal than the Senate 's Anderson bill . Brannan Bill 's Chances Fade Another effect of the agreement , according to well-posted observers , will be to lessen pressure for enactment next year of the farm program of Charles F. Brannan , - Secretary of Agriculture . One of the Brannan plan 's chief supporters , Senator Elmer Thomas , Democrat , of Oklahoma , chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee , had planned to open hearings on it early next session . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference agreement he might abandon those plans . At the same time Senator Lucas emphasized that in his estimation the compromise bill constituted " permanent legislation . " Under the Brannan plan , prices // FARM COMPROMISE MADE IN CONGRESS // of perishables would be permitted to drop to market levels , with the difference between them and the support standard to be made up by ' direct Government payments to farmers . The conventional support methods  --  Government purchases and loans to prevent surpluses from depressing the market  --  are relied upon under today 's conference agreement . The compromise bill would re'quire the Secretary of Agriculture to support prices of five basic commodities at 90 per cent of parity through 1950 and at 80 to 90 per cent through 1951 . After that , the Anderson sliding-scale system , providing props at 75 to 90 per cent of parity , would operate . Dual Standard of Parity An important part of the compromise was the adoption of a dual standard for parity , which is a price calculated to give the farmer a return in purchasing power that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period . The existing parity formula , based on the period 1909-14 , would have been continued under terms of the House bill . The Senate measure called for a " modernized " formula. , pegged to a moving base of the most recent ten years , and with hired labor included as a part of the farmer 's costs . Parity would be lower under the Senate formula for four of the basic commodities , wheat , corn , cotton and peanuts . It would be higher for most other products , ineluding rice , the other basic commodity affected by today 's compromise . Whichever formula would give the producer a higher support price would , have to be used ' through . 1953 for all crops , under terms of the conference agreement . After that , the Anderson formula would apply throughout . The compromise bill requires that the basic commodities be under either acreage allotments or marketing quotas to qualify for the mandatory high supports . But all of them , with the possible exception of rice , either are now controlled or will be brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is not affected by the agreement . Both Senate and House bills called for its support at 90 per cent of parity when under ' control , as it has been and is expected to continue to be . This provision remains unchanged . Dairy products , under the compromise , would be supported at 75 to 90 per cent of parity . Wool , mohair , Irish potatoes , tung nuts and honey would be supported at 60 to 90 per cent . Other commodities , could be supported at levels up to 90 per cent if the Secretary of Agriculture chose . Assurance for the first time that fruits and vegetables would receive favorable treatment was contained in a conference provision giving . them priority in the use of " Section 32 funds " - 30 per cent of customs receipts , which are set aside for agricultural purposes . This is expected to provide more than 8100 , - 000,000 annually for fruit and vegetable price supports . Another provision would allow for the disposal of governmentheld products in imminent danger of spoilage or deterioration . First priority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials . They could also be disposed of for school lunch programs , Indian relief and private I charity , with priorities assigned in the order named . Recipient organizations would pay transportation costs . In selling other governmentowned stocks acquired under the price-support program , the Commodity Credit Corporation would have to charge at least 5 per cent more than the current support I price , plus " reasonable " handling charges . To stimulate non - government construction of crop storage facilities , another provision would allow government loans to cooperatives of as much as 80 per cent of the cost . Refrigerated storage would be ineligible . The conferees eliminged one Senate amendment that probably would have prompted a veto by President Truman , according to Senator Lucas . Sponsored by Senator Warren G. Magnuson , Democrat , of Washington , the provision called for special treatment of agricultural commodities in the negotiation of ? reciprocal trade agreements with foreign countries . The House bill was sponsored by Representative Albert Gore , Democrat , of Tennessee , and the Senate measure by Senator Anderson . The Gore bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the present support system for another year . Besides the basic commodities , hogs , chickens , eggs and dairy products must be supported at 90 per cent under the existing program .
