The U.S. State Department quietly prepared a momentous conference . Secretary of State Dean Acheson , Britain 's Ernest Bevin and France 's Robert Schuman prepared for a meeting in Washington next week to discuss Western policy in Germany . <P> It was high time . The plan to create a democratic West German state had bogged down in a hopeless mess of confusion among the Western powers . The economic revival of Bizonia that followed currency reform ( TIME , June 28 ) had no counterpart in the political field . The constitutional convention at Bonn was in deadlock . Cynicism and the old unwholesome , distorted German nationalism were spreading . More &; more West German leaders were flirting with the idea of a deal with Russia . <P> TIME 'S Berlin Bureau Chief Emmet Hughes spent the past month touring Western Germany to size up the nature of the crisis the Washington conference must try to meet . His report : <P> The Gingerbread Jewel Box . " I can not tell , I can not decide , " a Western official in Cologne told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face at all . " <P> He summed up all the doubts , fears and confusions which hang like a heavy fog over Germany . The nation which produced Goethe and Goebbels , great cultural triumphs and human incinerators , has always produced eerie contrasts . Today , these contrasts seem to have taken physical shape . The face of Germany is hideously scarred-and yet , almost every where , one sees another face which is sleek and smooth . <P> In Nrnberg , which Germans used to call their Schatzkstlein ( little jewel box ) , one looks down at night from the great 11th Century castle on the sparkling lights below which seem to stud a living , healthy city . But in the light of day , the city is a ruin , rendered only more monstrous by the neat little gingerbread houses which poke impertinently above the debris . <P> Up north , in the Ruhr , driving along the Rhine at twilight , one sees the sky greyed with smoke from hundreds of factory chimneys . But just as one begins to marvel at the normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great broken Rhine bridge whose gashed ends point aimlessly into the sky . <P> Dsseldorf , the Ruhr 's money and fashion capital , is drab and desolate . But by night , scrap dealers and black marketeers crowd into such slick cellar restaurants as the Goldene Treppe ( Golden Staircase ) , where they dine on smoked salmon and duck at $12 a meal , and into such cafs as the Allotria ( Tomfoolery ) , where they jitterbug to Bel Mir Bist Du Schn with heavily rouged hostesses known in Germany as Animierdamen- " animation ladies . " <P> The Glittering Smile . Said one American , contemplating these subterranean revels : " You might almost think the Germans are going underground again , leaving the ruins above ground to mock their conquerors . " But there are other types of underground Germans-the thousands of homeless in Dsseldorf and every Ruhr city , who live in herds in stifling air-raid bunkers . The fits to which these cave dwellers are frequently subject have been nicknamed Bunkerkholler ( bunker frenzy ) . <P> <P> When the blowup comes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls , or beats bloody knuckles against them .
