If any of you were among the audience of 1,500 music-lovers at the annual Spartanburg , South Carolina , Music Festival on Friday , April 30 , or , later , tuned in radio station WSPA at the proper time , you witnessed or heard a novel event in TIME 'S history : the first performance , by a symphony orchestra and chorus of 70 voices , of Half Moon Mountain , a modern American ballad inspired by a story in TIME . <P> We have known about Half Moon Mountain almost since its inception . About a year ago Composer-Pianist Edwin Otto Gerschefski , dean of music at Spartanburg 's Converse College , wrote us about his plan . He said he was a weekly reader of TIME with a habit of clipping stories and depositing them in the pocket of his jacket for easy reference . One such story , from the May 26 , 1947 issue , had impr es s e d him so much ( " I could n't get it out of my mind " ) that he wanted permission to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minutes from Broadway , was an account of the life and death of Gilbert Pitt , recluse , who had lived for 81 years in a dirt-floored shack in the Ramapo Mountains of New York , 30 miles northwest of Manhattan . Together with his housekeeper , Maggie Gannon , he had passed much of his time avoiding the so-called conveniences of modern society . Last spring , suffering from a heart attack , he waited for the dogwood to bloom ; then he died . <P> Last summer , fortified by a $500 grant from the Carnegie Foundation , Gerschefski settled down in a farmhouse in West Cambridge , N.Y. , above the Ramapos , with his wife , who is also a composer and pianist , and their five children , aged one to 13 and ranging in talent from piano and trumpet through the cello . The nearest piano was an old upright in tiny Whiteside Church some miles away on a dusty country road . Gerschefski went there on foot each morning to work on his ballad , repay ing the parson on Sundays for the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One afternoon , while Gerschefski was working , a sudden summer thunderstorm came up and lightning struck the church 's furnace , filling the structure with sulphur fumes . Gerschefski is not certain but what some of the lightning and sulphur remained in his composition . By summer 's end the ballad was finished . <P> Although the music is Gerschefski 's the lyrics are taken verbatim from TIME 'S story in National Affairs , which was writen by Robert Hagy . The ballad 's production became a Spartanburg communal project . It is arranged in four parts for orchestra , women 's chorus and baritone solo . The baritone was a local coal and sand man ; the orchestra and chorus were made up of college music students , housewives and Spartanburg businessmen . They rehearsed for weeks , not only for the ballad but also for the rest of the 35-year-old festival 's program . <P> Gratified by the audience 's reception of Half Moon Mountain , Gerschefski , who is 39 and a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Yale with degrees in music and philosophy , said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to identify themselves with in a world that makes it impossible to do so .
