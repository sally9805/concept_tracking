Peruvian Ambassador Alfredo Benavides had an idea , and to sell it he invited the heads of the diplomatic missions in Ottawa to come around for a drink . The idea : a gift to mark the retirement of U.S. Ambassador Ray Atherton ( TIME , Aug. 23 ) , dean of Ottawa 's diplomatic corps . Ambassador Benavides had no trouble persuading 32 of his colleagues . A silver cigar box , they decided , would be just the thing , and it should be engraved with the signatures of the mission heads . <P> Because no Russian had showed up at the get-together , the Peruvian Ambassador wrote the Soviets ' charge d'affaires , Nikolai Belokhvostikov , inviting him to join in . A week passed without an answer . Then Benavides ' secretary phoned the Soviet embassy ; he explained what was planned , suggested that the letter must have gone astray , and added that he was sure that Belokhvostikov would want his name on the box . " It is not customary , " snapped the Russian as he hung up .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
