Greatest amateur painter who ever lived , a retired French customs inspector named Henri Rousseau , had his biggest U.S. exhibition ever , at the Chicago Art Institute last fortnight . In Manhattan , 30 men &; women who painted for fun in their spare time will have their works elaborately hung this week at the Marie Harriman Gallery . A connoisseur of amateur painting named Sidney Janis has written a solemn 236-page book about them. * All these amateurs had one thing in common : they had learned painting the hard way , by laboriously teaching themselves . <P> Rousseau , pioneer of modern amateurs , died 31 years ago . In the years since his death , collectors have rummaged through attics , farmhouses , junk shops , looking for work of other self-taught geniuses . For amateur artists ( sometimes called " self-taught , " " primitives , " " popular painters " ) , working without benefit of formal art-school rules , often , like untrained folk musicians , create quaint pictorial myths that outshine the work of educated artists . Inexpert at perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat shadowless backgrounds . But although they have the technique of children they have the patience of adults , so that their laborious work has the charm of finely detailed craftsmanship . <P> Rousseau 's Jungle . An ex-army sergeant who fought with the Emperor Maximilian in Mexico and in the Franco-Prussian War , Henri Rousseau retired at 41 from his job inspecting baggage and decided to devote the rest of his life to becoming a painter . That was in 1885 . He had never been near an art school , and his diminutive pension would not stretch far enough to pay for instruction . So he set out , with enormous patience , to teach himself . <P> Completely uninfluenced by highbrow , esthetic theories and by the splashy Impressionist and Post-Impressionist styles that then dominated French art , Painter Rousseau painted things he enjoyed : exotic , tropical jungles full of childishly round-eyed animals , portraits of his friends , wistful nudes reclining in imaginary , saladlike forest scenes . <P> The carefully painted leaves of his jungle trees he copied from sprigs and grass-blades that he picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were painted after trips to the Paris zoo . For years he worked away in a drab little studio above a plasterer 's shop , taking his paintings very seriously , lavishing the utmost care on each geometrically exact landscape . When he started sending his pictures each year to the Salon des Independants to be hung alongside the works of painters like Redon ( TIME , Aug. 25 ) , Seurat and Signac , critics and fellow artists suppressed smiles . <P> But Rousseau persisted . By 1907 the world had begun to acclaim him as one of the most important of modern French artists , and painters who had once laughed at him were trying to forget their education and paint like Rousseau . At this tribute Customs Inspector Rousseau , who always considered himself a realistic painter , was not the least bit surprised . Remarked he , demurely , to famed Modern Artist Pablo Picasso : " We two are the greatest painters of our time ; you in the Egyptian style , myself in the modern . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
