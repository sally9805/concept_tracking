From the Automotive Council for War Production this week came a stirring report on industry 's first six months at war : <P> &gt; The automotive industry has undertaken to build 75% of all the aircraft engines , more than 33% of the machine guns , 40% of the tanks , besides all the motorized units . One company alone is making more than half the Diesel engines for the whole U.S. Navy . <P> &gt; The industry is working three shifts a day on war orders totaling $14,000,000,000 . In terms of pleasure cars and trucks , that would mean 15,000,000 units-three years ' peacetime production . <P> &gt; It is cutting costs and saving time all along the line through mass-production short cuts : a parts plant lopped 25% off the time Army Ordnance thought it would take to make machine guns ; an automaker cut the time scheduled for a British ack-ack gun by four months and evolved a new way of broaching the barrel that cut that operation from 3 hours to 15 minutes ; another parts maker improvised machine-gun equipment that beats regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost $1,200 to make 18 months ago now costs around $600 ; a new flame-cutting process turned out 12 tank-engine sprockets in 6 minutes v. 8 hours formerly required for a single sprocket . <P> It goes on &; on . But perhaps the most extraordinary thing of all about Detroit-at-war is the change in the industry 's thinking about improvisation . As late as a year ago , many automen swore that not much more than 15% of their wonderful one-purpose tools could be used for anything but automobile production . This week 's report cited one automaker who is now using more than 80% of his automotive tools and equipment for war production . For the industry as a whole , the big manufacturers have converted some 66 ? % of their automotive equipment , the smaller ones more than 40%.
