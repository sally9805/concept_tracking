On a tiny Pacific island huddled within the circumference of a broken coral ring , a detachment of white-clad U.S. sailors last week went through a time-honored ceremony . The bugles blared " To the Colors , " the flag was run up , the watch posted . The Navy 's new station on the Midway Islands , first pier in the tenuous 5,860-mile water bridge between Pearl Harbor and the Philippines , was in com mission . <P> Skipper of Midway was no rear admiral but a Navy commander . But its importance to the U.S. was far out of proportion to the three stripes on its commander 's shoulder boards . From Midway 's dredged-out central lagoon ( landing place for Pan Am Clippers ) the largest Navy seaplane tenders can mother a fleet of patrol bombers , ranging as far north as Alaska 's Aleutian chain , south to Pago Pago , west to the edges of Japan itself . <P> Into Midway 's narrow channel U.S. submarines and light craft can slip for refueling and minor repairs . <P> Midway 's commissioning was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast &; furiously at its bases be yond Hawaii since it got the wherewithal from a grudging Congress . Next week there will be a brief pause in the clatter of work on two other outposts - Johnston and Palmyra Islands . The ceremony will be repeated again and two of the Navy 's flying lieutenants will take over as C.O.s . <P> These aircraft stations will buttress the reconnaissance and bombing powers of the Pacific Fleet on the long reach south from Pearl Harbor to the Navy 's long-neglected station on Samoa . There , in the storied harbor of Pago Pago , workmen are also busy building a first-rate aircraft station , a secondary station for water craft to bridge the long reach between Pearl Harbor and Australian bases . <P> But Navy men keep their most anxious eye on the water bridge east through Mid way . Beyond Wake , the bridge passes through the Japanese mandated islands . Since the early ' 30s Japan has worked hard building up air bases in this cluster of hundreds of islands and her other pin points of land in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other islands than Navymen like to think about , she has stored fuel , erected air and submarine bases , may even have established bases for light surface craft . <P> Beyond Wake lies the next pier in the Pacific bridge - Guam , which Congress long refused to fortify for fear of offending Japan . Today Guam less than 1,500 miles from Japan , is being outfitted as another of the U.S. 's intermediate Pacific air stations , and an advanced Fleet base to boot . <P> For $200,000,000 it could have been built into a fortified fleet base second only to the mighty fortress of Pearl Harbor . But the job would take two or three years ; today it is too late . The Navy will have to do its best with the time it still has . <P> Yet the Navy is fairly well off with the Pacific defense now building . The radii of its patrol planes overlap from Alaska 's Dutch Harbor to Samoa 's Pago Pago , from Pearl Harbor to Manila . The Navy can cover the Pacific against any surprise attack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job is up to the bombers , and to the Pacific and Asiatic Fleets , which are now spread from Hawaii to Manila in a pattern that no Navy man will reveal .
