Like the loyal Westchester and Long Island commuters who would not think of boarding their homebound trains without it , the old ( 112 years ) New York Sun dresses conservatively , does its huffing &; puffing in genteel tones , and ordinarily abhors the idea of making a scene . It seldom surprises its small ( circ. 294,000 ) clientele , many of whom consider the independent Democratic New York Times unforgivably radical ( the Times supported Roosevelt in 1932 , 1936 and 1944 ) . <P> But a week ago , the Sun surprised even itself . Finally losing all patience with Harry Truman , it burst out all over Page One with a scalding editorial headed PRESIDENT TRUMAN GRINS WHILE LEWIS STRIKES . Excerpts : " Today the country is all but paralyzed . . . the nation beholds its President halting , hesitating , shuffling , postponing . . . . There is a good , old-fashioned word for all this . It is Cowardice . Useless Cowardice , silly Cowardice , unfruitful Cowardice ! " <P> The Sun 's outburst brought a storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " applauding it to the echo . Impressed by the greatest reader response in a decade , Executive Editor Keats Speed plastered 90 of them across 13 columns of type . The Sun knew its readers did n't like the Administration , but seemed surprised that they felt so strongly about it . <P> The Sun is a paper where tradition counts-but its tradition has not always been archconservative , nor have frontpage manifestos always been rare in it . In the great Charles A. Dana 's day it frequently supported Democrats , and in Groceryman Frank Munsey 's time ( 1916-25 ) , violent eruptions which staffers called " Munsey proclamations " appeared with regularity on the face of the Sun . Great ghosts still haunt its dim corridors . Courtly Keats Speed , a great-nephew of Poet John Keats , still puts out his cigaret when he enters the newsroom , in habitual deference to a rule of the Munsey era , long since repealed . He and City Editor Edmond Bartnett , after 25 years , still address each other as " Mr. " Sun employes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own little union instead of a Newspaper Guild unit . <P> The paper has had its share of famous reporters ( Frank O'Malley , Will Irwin , Alexander Woollcott , Edwin C. Hill , etc. ) , and still has a stable of byliners , including Critic Ward Morehouse , Cartoonist Rube Goldberg , Paragrapher H. I. Phillips . By long custom , Sun editorial writers are anonymous and stay that way : Francis Pharcellus Church , who wrote the famous " Yes , Virginia , there is a Santa Claus " editorial on short notice in 1897 , had to wait until his obituary ( 1906 ) to get credit for it . <P> The Sun had outlived its days of greatness ( it is now seventh in circulation among Manhattan 's nine dailies ) before many of its present readers were old enough to vote the straight Republican ticket . Today 's Sun editorials , like last week 's on Truman , are plotted by Speed , General Manager Edwin S. Friendly and James Craig , chief editorial writer . Young ( 35 ) President-Publisher Thomas Dewart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is little argument at their conferences . " We all think alike , so it 's easy , " says Keats Speed .
