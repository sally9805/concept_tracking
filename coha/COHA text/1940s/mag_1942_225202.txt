Prime Minister John Curtin this week proclaimed publicly what everyone had guessed privately : Australia could not possibly embark on a large-scale offensive for at least six months . " Until then , a basically holding policy will dominate tactics . There is no intention to sacrifice troops until Australia has the resources necessary for a successful offensive . " <P> But the Australians at least had launched a little offensive-if retaking , against no opposition , a few miles of recently lost backyard could be dignified by that term . By last fortnight , when some Japs pushed southward across the precipitous Owen Stanley Mountain Range , the Japanese were only 32 miles from vital Port Moresby . Some uneasy observers began to believe the unpredictable Japs might try to take well-defended Port Moresby by land , using only the troops and supplies that could be hauled along the " impassable " one-man jungle- &-mountain; path . It would be an audacious gesture , but Australian troops had already had a bitter taste of Jap audacity in the milder jungles of Malaya ( where 17,000 Australians were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , newly arrived crack Australian Imperial troops ( including the famed " rats " who holed in for eight months at Tobruk ) launched their little offensive last week . At mountain peak No. 3 ( of the six between Port Moresby and the gap at the top of the range ) they seeped through and outflanked the foremost Jap positions . But the Japs , softened by strafing and bombing raids , had already withdrawn . <P> The Australians ceased to marvel at the Jap miracle of bringing one 37-mm. gun over those mountains . In fact , they discovered they could bring heavier 25-pounders themselves when they decided to go forward over the smaller peaks . The Japs had dug trenches , set up machine-gun nests in the roots of trees , piled up log barricades-but evidently thought better of their plan to defend their foremost ridge , 88 long miles over the mountains from their Buna supply base . <P> Next day the Australians pushed forward , but found no Japs , except some coolies who had been killed by strafing .

Nearing the gap . the Aussies made " light contact " with Jap patrols , but where and when the battle of the Owen Stanley Mountains would be joined , nobody knew . The Australians crept forward more cautiously , lest they fall into a Jap trap . <P> Port Moresby ( and Australia , which it protects ) could breathe easier . The Japs were now more than 50 miles , or 30 hours ' walking , away .
