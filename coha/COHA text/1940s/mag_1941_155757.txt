To the 3,500,000 U.S. golfers , the 4.000,000 tennis players , and innumerable ball-bouncers , the grim reality of war was brought stunningly home last week . OPM ruled : no more golf , tennis , squash , hand-balls . Stricken sportsmen , brooding on the last bounce of the last ball , swamped stores ( one sports shop sold 2,000 dozen golf balls by 11 a.m . ) . Other gamesters planned to take up games priorities could never affect : croquet , parchesi , tic-tac-toe.
