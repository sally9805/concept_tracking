Nowhere in the world is Spiritualism so respectable as in England . There it rates as a real religion , has attracted some great names ( Sir Oliver Lodge , Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ) . Although England 's 2,500 Spiritualist societies do not keep membership rolls , at least 250,000 believers go to Sunday-night meetings and probably 1,000,000 altogether call themselves Spiritualists . The Confraternity of Clergy , Ministers and Spiritualists claims that 100 Christian divines belong to the cult . Alarmed by this trend , the Archbishop of Canterbury more than four years ago appointed a committee to investigate Spiritualism . <P> Headed by Dr. Francis Underhill , then Dean of Rochester , now Bishop of Bath &; Wells , the committee took testimony from psychic researchers , both believers and skeptics . Some committeemen secretly attended sances . Nine months ago the committee had its report ready . To the great dismay not only of His Grace of Canterbury but of his colleague the Archbishop of York , the report was not unfavorable to Spiritualism . That , at least , was the conclusion Spiritualists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been suppressed . Said Fred Hawken , secretary of the Marylebone Spiritualist Association : " I am confident that the report would have appeared if it had been adverse . " <P> The Bishop of Bath &; Wells , hardly a dealer in magic and spells , * was said by Spiritualists last week to be " sympathetic or at least fair " toward Spiritualism . Another committeeman , Very Rev. Walter Robert Matthews , Dean of St. Paul 's Cathedral , hinted at the tone of the report when he told the Society for Psychical Research that , discounting fraud and illusion , there remained a residuum of fact suggesting the possibility of life after death . <P> Said Editor Maurice Barbanell of Psychic News : " This suppression is just the usual trouble the Church of England has with anything unorthodox . It once opposed umbrellas on the basis of the Bible citation , He . . . sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust . It is always 500 years behind the times , and this is the latest example . " Said a representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required . " <P> * Like John Wellington Wells in Gilbert &; Sullivan 's The Sorcerer.
