U.S. railroaders this week waited for ICC to grant them a boost in freight rates . They did not expect the full 10% increase they had asked ( TIME , Dec. 22 ) , but they did expect around 6-7% . That would add some $275,000,000 to their 1942 revenues , atop the $45,000,000 passenger-rate increase granted last month . <P> These new rates mean increased costs to almost every big U.S. manufacturer , to consumers and to the Government , now the nation 's largest single shipper . Yet at the ICC hearings the only real opposition to it came from farmer-befriending Secretary Wickard . Not even Leon Henderson protested . For he knew the boost , however inflationary , was probably inevitable . <P> Fact is , the railroads needed it . A rate rise was implicit in the deal by which they gave their labor a wage increase of $330,000,000 last November . Besides , it will cost railroaders this year an extra $25-30,000,000 to keep saboteurs off tracks and trains . And higher equipment and raw material costs will run them into unguessable millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more traffic , the railroads can probably maintain their 1942 net profits at around $500,000,000 , on a par with last year . In comparison with any year since 1930 , this is profit indeed ( see chart , which covers Class I roads ) . But for the railroads the ' 30s were a bankruptcy decade ; and bankruptcy is no condition in which to go to war . <P> From the national viewpoint , the important question is not whether $500,000,000 is a lot of money , but what the railroads do with it . So far , they have not dribbled it away . In the last two years long-parched stockholders got $360,000,000-about 50% of the 1940-41 net . In the same two years the roads repaid $117,529,000 to PWA and RFC , thus cutting their Government debts to $455,244,000 , less than half their total original borrowings . Moreover , many a railroad learned well the No. 1 lesson of the ' 30s : that fixed charges , if not reduced in good times , are the surest way to go broke in bad . Southern Railway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atchison , Topeka &; Santa Fe retired $28,070,500 of 4% convertible debentures ; New York Central is planning to pay off $16,000,000 bank loans due in 1942-44 . Boston &; Maine , Baltimore &; Ohio and others are buying their own bonds on the market . <P> If this policy is continued , a little prosperity now will help the railroads both to fight the war and win the peace . For war , they need a healthy cash account ; they must stand ready to haul troops and war materials in unscheduled rushes , which is expensive . And if they are to survive the peace , the roads must be flush enough to buy equipment- new , streamlined , experimental , costly-with which to compete in a world full of freight and passenger planes .
