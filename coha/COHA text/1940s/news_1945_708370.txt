txt The fats and oils industry is in a new crisis of scarcity which could intensify a prospective crisis of surplus after the war . The shortage will affect , quite literally . I the butcher , the baker and the candlestick maker ? in addition to food processors . paint and soap manufacturers , and a host of other industries . It will be brought home to the public by the resumption of rationing of lard , shortenings and edible oils which goes into effect Monday . Behind the scenes effects are multitudinous and involved . Congresshas authorized a new $5 an acre " incentive payment " for farmers who raise flax for seed to be crushed into linseed oil . Paint producers- recently have been reduced to 60% of their 1940-41 uae of oils . Shifts in Edible-Inedible Uses Emergencies have distorted the traditional American distinction between " edible " and " inedible " products . The Russians , for example , think linseed oil is delicious ; we use it for paints . But we are lend-leasing substantial quantities to the Soviet . Meanwhile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fats as raw materials for their inedible product , though it costs them more to do so . The shortage of oils and fats is a good deal like the shortage of military aircraft . It 's based on a war situation  --  and when peace comes , GOvernment agricultural officials fear , there will be vast surplus facilities . Important foreign sources of vegetable oils have been lost with the war . In a normal year such Imports amount to more than half a billion pounds , including coconut and palm oils from the Orient . Then feed became short , and the Government discouraged hog production so effectively ' that last year 's crop was 29% below 1943 's and a further drop is expected this year . That means a lot less lard . Flax had a bad year , too , so linseed oil is short . Fear For The Future That 's the current picture . For the longpull , the Government has been encouraging farmers to step up production of vegetable oil crops . peanuts . soybeans , flax . It bolsters pleas for expanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so enthusiastically that last year peanut production , for example was close to 2,18 billion pounds compared with pre-war 1941 's 1.56 billion pound crop , Soybeans harvested in the year just endea totaled 193 million bushels compared with 107 million bushels in 1941 . Now Federal functionaries are worrying I about the post-war future . They fear that foreign exporting countries will encroach upon the U. 7. market . Overall output of fats and oils soared from a 1937-41 average of 8.2 billion pounds annually to 11.2 billion pounds in 1944 . There has been an expansion , too , in many crushing and refining facilities . The capacity of soybean plants in the corn belt alone 11- ' been increased by 30 million bushels durirg the war to 150 million bushels . Hydrogenation plants , which harden oils so they will keep better , can turn out 5% more than before the war . Margarine manufacture hit a wartime high in output of 614 million pounds in 1943 , compared with a prediction of 351 million poi : s during 1940-41 , The National Association of Margarine Manufacturers say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds " with the addition of a little minor equipment . " Problem of Punt-War Protection This , then , is the fats and oils war baby the Government wants to protect after the war . Most officials frown on higher tar : fra on imported oil as " contrary to the Administration 's policy of international cooperation . " Present tariffs ; are not considered h. : - 11 enough to bar huge shipments mainly from the Philippines and the Netherlands C Indies . So the Department of Agriculi  --  a has worked out two plans , still in the formalative stage , which will accomplish the same result : Construction of a semi-permanent incubator for the war baby . Both plans are based on the fact that existing legislation commits the Government to support the price of specified commodities -- including the major edible oil crops -- at 90% of parity . They are : 1 . The Government , through a guaranteed loan prdgram , would acquire all the oil crops for which there are price guarantees ( soybeans , peanuts , flaxseed and presumably cottonseed i . It would then offer these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This would differ from the current loan  --  guarantee system , whereby the Government loan is used to support market prices at the loan level . 2 . Farmers would sell their oil crops in the open market for whatever they could get . They would then receive Federal subsidies for the difference between their sale price and 90% of parity guaranteed them by Uncle Sam . See Increasing Domestic Consumption Provided the price problem can be straightened out , the Agriculture Department is not greatly worried over the ability of peacetime markets here to absorb fats and oils production at wartime levels . Consumption will increase in line with the available supply , according to department officials . They say consumption is being held down now at home because of " forced exports " to the United Kingdom and Russia . By 1948 the department estimates that consumption in this country will rise to 11 billion pounds , compared with 9.7 billion in 1940 . Production in 1948 should amount to 10 billion pounds , which would leave a market here for one billion pounds of imports . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to curb production by requiring farmers to stay within acreage allotments and marketing quotas to be eligible for loans . Some officials advocate a slight modification of this plan under which farmers would be allowed to produce to the limit but would be eligible for loans only on that portion of their output which fell within acreage allotments and marketing quotas . The Steagall amendment to the Stabilization Act of 1942 is the legislative backbone of the support price program for fats and oils . It authorizes the announcement of support prices on commodities needed for the war , and specifies that these price floors must be maintained on the announced commodities at 90t1 of parity or the comparable price for at least two years after the war . General Line of Attack Although agricultural experts have mapped out a general line of attack on the postwar fats and oils problem , they maintain that each ? commodity is a problem in itself . Take soybeans , for instance : Agricultural economists , explain the Government could reduce Lie support price as much as 50 cents per bushel and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parity or the comparable price . " Based on the comparable price on December 15 , the mandatory support level for soybeans would be $1.48 per bushel The actual support price , however , is $2,04 . The majority of department ' officials favor letting the post-war market price drop to the minimum support level before inaugurating any loan program to keep farm prices at a floor level . A price of $1.48 per bushel for soybeans " might permit the U. S. to meet foreign competition for a year or so after the war , " according to one agricultural expert . Officials expect to run into more difficulties with flaxseed , which they think will require operation of the loan plan immediately after the war . South America always has . been able to outdo the United States billow cost production . The United States now has s duty of 32i:a cents per bushel on all flaxseed imports which will be lifted to 50 cents per bushel after the war according to the terms of a trade agreement with Argentina  --  the country which supplied 80 ' 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the increased duty , however , agricultural economists estimate that Argentina could bring flaxseed into the United States between $1.50 and $2 per bushel . The corresponding United States minimum support price probably would be $2.80 , they say . Thus , they explain , the Agriculture Department might make . loans at $2.80 and then sell the flaxseed put under loan in a market which would bring between $1.50 and $2 . This would mean a Government subsidy to farmers amounting to between 80 cents and $1.30 per bushel of flaxseed . Without this device the planners fear that no one would pay an extra 80 cents ' for home grown flaxseed , and local producers would be forced out of business . Lard and Cottonseed Problems Lard and cottonseed will present unique post-war problems because they are the only major items in the fats and oils category for which support prices have not been announced . Agricultural economists feel that lard prices can stay at low levels ethout disastrous results because a farmer who gets a support price for his hogs can afford to supply lard at competitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they look fora high-price policy because ' of support price guarantees for other oilseeds  --  flaxseed , for instance . Surveying the entire fats and oils picture , experts say it has changed during the war for one basic reason  --  curtailment of trade with the major far eastern producing areas . notably the Philippines and Netherlands East Indies . Since 1920 the U. S. had depended on these areas to supply part of its fats and 0115 needs . When war cut off the supply , however . the U. S. had to produce its own fats and oils or do without . It took the first course , and did so well that in 1944 it was able to export between 1.5 billion and 2 billion pounds ' of fats and oils to the United Kingdom and Russia . But officials here do n't expect this export trade to outlast the war . They point out that these two wartime customers will be more anxious to use their dollar exchange for the purchase of U. S. machinery and equipment . With increased consumption at home , officials expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net importer of fats and oils . This is why Federal planners are concerning themselves only with the problem of " protecting domestic markets " for doiaestic producers .
