txt The Ways and Means Committee put the finishing touches today on the largest revenue bill in United States history , adding an estimated yield of $3,503,400,000 to present Federal taxation . The committee then sent the bill to the legislative drafting service to be translated into legal phraseology . Representative Doughton of North Carolina , chairman of the committee , and Representative Cooper of Tennessee , chairman of the subcommittee on taxation , estimated that the bill would not be ready for final consideration by the committee for avo weeks . Another week probably will be required for ironing out details , which would mean that the bill would not be ready for consideration by the House before July 24 . Sept. 15 was said to be the earliest possible date on which Congressional consideration could be completed . The measure was proposed to increase Federal revenues by 50 per cent , and , according to present Treasury estimates of receipts for the fiscal year 1942 , the bill would mean that more than 513,000.000 , - 000 in cash would be available to meet ordinary running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present estimates of income and outgo the deficit next year would be about $9,000,000,000 , which will be raised through borrowing . Dips Into All Channels The committee dipped into most of the possible revenue channels . From corporations , through an upward revision of income levies and the imposition of additional excess profits taxes , and from individuals through a surtax schedule starting at 5 per ? committee found i it could By increasing rates on - ixisting excise taxes and through the imposition of others the committee estimated that 51,034,900,000 would be raised . Increases in the rates onl estate and gift taxes were estimated to bring in $113,700,000 more . Included in the committee 's decision on individual income taxes was the requirement that married couples hereafter must file a joint return . The yield from this provision was estimated at $323,000,600 . The individual income tax surtax schedule would start at 5 per cent on all income above exemptions , and run upward to 75 per cent on incomes of $4,000,000 or more . In addition the taxpayer would be required to pay a 10 per cent defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deductions Changed The present system of permitting corporations to determine their normal taxes through the alternative methods of invested capital or average earnings was retained by the committee . But it disallowed the normal tax as a deduction in computing excess profits and permitted instead a deduction of the excess profits tax in computing normal taxes . In addition , it raised the present excess profits rates 10 per cent in each bracket , making the maximum tax 60 per cent . When the committee met today it found itself $35,000,000 short of its goal of $3,500,000,000 in additional revenue . It voted three more excise levies , and a revision of one previously adopted . The revision was on the coinoperated devices levy . The tax now would be made to apply only to such devices operated for pleasure or chance ( such as pinball and slot ma chines ) , and not to vending , machines . The new levies were these : Increasing the present withholding tax on non-resident aliens and non-resident corporations from 161,4 to 271/2 per cent , estimated to yield $20,000,000 . Increasing the capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1.25 , estimated to yield $18,000,000 . Imposing a tax on cutlery of 10 per cent , estimated to yield $5,000,000 . ? In revising the coin-operated devices tax there was a loss of $5 , - 000,000 of revenue , which brought ? to $38,000,000 today 's net additions to estimated ? .. evenue. $5 Use Tax Added to Auto Increase Standing out among the increases in excises and miscellaneous taxes were those on distilled spirits : $1 a gallon , to make the new tax $4 a gallon ; a doubling of the present 31,4 per cent tax on automobiles , parts and accessories ; the raising to 5 per cent the tax on trucks and buses , and higher levies on tires and tubes . In addition to these was a new levy , called a " use " tax , of $5 a year on an automobile , yacht or airplane . The committee also went back to World War taxes by imposing a levy of 1-6 cent per bottle on soft drinks . This amounts to 4 cents a case , which the committee thought would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The committee voted a 5 per cent tax on telephone bills and new rates on long distance calls , telegrams and cablegrams . If adopted by Congress , the rate hereafter would be 5 cents on a long distance , call or telegram costing between 25 and 50 cents ; 10 cents between ' 50 cents and $1 ; and ranging upward to a 25-cent tax on a call costing between $2 and $2.50 ; , with 5 cents more on each additional 50 cents above $2.50 . The tax on calls and telegrams will affect wire circuits transmitting stock quotations and news , as well as teletypewriters , burglar alarm systems and similar sery- - ices . On leased wires , however , it was construed that the tax would not be applicable . But the language to govern this type of tax has not yet been drafted . In computing the yield of the bill , the committee and the Treasury Department did not take into consideration the return from taxes on floor stocks . Assuming that the measure became law by Sept. 15. the government would have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floors at the rates to be prescribed . Thus , $200,000,000 more than the estimates might be realized during the fiscal year 1942.
