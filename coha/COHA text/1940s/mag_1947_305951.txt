Everybody who is anybody in the rich hierarchy of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters , Chauffeurs , Warehousemen &; Helpers knows that tough Dave Beck has been angling for years to take Dan Tobin 's throne whenever vain , old ( 72 ) King Dan decides to step down . <P> For a time last week , it looked as if Dave Beck had finally made it . As everybody expected , Uncle Dan made him the union 's executive vice president-the crown-princely post which Tobin and Beck created at the last Teamsters ' convention ( TIME , Aug. 25 ) . Teamster courtiers were sure that this was it ; the boys were even trying to figure out who would get Dave 's mahogany-paneled office in Seattle , where he rules a Teamster duchy of eleven western states . <P> Last week , Dave and Dan were in Washington . A newsman went to see them in Dave 's orange- &-green; suite in the Hotel Statler . The first question , addressed to King Dan : " What will Mr. Beck 's duties be now ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what I tell him to do . He 'll do what the general president wants him to do . " At this , Dave tiptoed to a hall door and closed it , lest Dan Tobin 's voice be heard all over the Statler 's fourth floor . <P> " He 'll do what I tell him to do , " Dan continued , " and when the time comes that he does n't , he 'll be reduced back to the status of a vice president . Is n't that so , Dave ? " <P> Beck , who also likes to shout , murmured " Yes , sir . " <P> Tobin roared on : " I 've got to have more help . I ca n't keep track of everything . Dave will relieve me of some of my travel and leg work . " <P> Beck interposed : " Make no mistake about it-Dan is good for general president for at least ten years . " Tobin jiggled his ruddy jowls and growled his assent . <P> It seemed as if Dave would have to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't look too good . It reads : " Acting temporary executive vice president . "
