The day after Christmas , the great Berlin airlift was six months old . By then , it had carried 700,000 tons of supplies to besieged Berlin . That meant an average of 3,800 tons in an average of 550 flights a day ( one-third by Britain 's R.A.F. ) . Last week , Air Secretary Symington said that in 1949 , when new planes are put into operation , the daily total can be doubled . So far , 17 Americans and seven Britons have been killed in airlift accidents . <P> A grudging tribute came from Friedrich Ebert , Communist mayor of Berlin 's Soviet sector . " They seem to have no lack of planes and pilots and gasoline , " he said . " I live in Potsdam and hear the damned things roaring over the house all night . "
