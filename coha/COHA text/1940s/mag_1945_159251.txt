To fill the vacancy left by the death of Idaho 's Republican Senator John Thomas , Idaho 's Democratic Governor Charles G. Gossett exercised a governor 's well-used prerogative . Sturdy Charles Gossett , a well-to-do farmer whose political thinking plows a furrow well to the right of center , resigned his governorship and let his successor appoint him to the vacancy on Capitol Hill . <P> With Democrat Gossett replacing Republican Thomas , the Senate balance-of-power is right back where it started after the 1944 elections . Although five Senators have died and two resigned since the elections , the Democrats still have 56 , the Republicans 38.
