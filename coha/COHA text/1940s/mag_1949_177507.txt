Three world citizens were sitting in the sunny Caf de Flore , the shrine of Left Bank Bohemia , feeling quite sorry for themselves . After the pleasant splash that First World Citizen Garry Davis had made last winter ( TIME , Jan. 10 ) , the world seemed to have lost interest in the movement that was designed to unite it in peace . <P> On to Glory . The three Davis followers were Anders Clarin , 37 , a Swede who had spent the better part of his life in the import-export business until one day he got sick of filling out government forms and went to Paris ( i.e. , the Flore ) ; Cameron Ewan , 19 , who left Christ Church College , Oxford at 16 and put in time as a Liberal Party worker before getting into the world citizenship game ; and Ruth Allanbrook , 23 , the pretty daughter of a Boston business executive , who was studying art in Paris . The trio had hoped to find excitement in world citizenship ; instead , they were wasting their young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was required to break the world 's shocking indifference . A wonderful idea was born . <P> Clarin went to Belgium and took a plane to London . When he got there , Clarin told the British immigration official that he had torn up his passport over the Channel , and that this formally made him a citizen of the world . " I see what you mean , " said the Briton , " but it wo n't do . " <P> Clarin was forced to take the plane back to Brussels . There , according to the plan , the authorities were supposed to send him back to London , and London back again to Brussels , so that he would dramatically shuttle back &; forth until the world got the point ( whatever the point was ) . But the Belgians did not stick to the scenario and put Clarin in the red brick prison known in Brussels as the Little Castle . For two weeks , the world citizen stayed in a cell together with two dozen common drunks . <P> Back to the Envelopes . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescue , decided to picket the prison . But in Belgium picketing is illegal in certain out-of-bounds areas , and the Little Castle was out of bounds , all right . The rescuers , however , found that the law said nothing against demonstrations on canals . Next day , in a rubber dinghy , Ewan set out on the Canal de Charleroi , right next to the prison . Through a megaphone of rolled newspapers , he shouted that Clarin should be freed . <P> Ewan stayed on the canal that night , the next day and the next night . He was . wrapped in blankets and rubber sheeting . His voice turned hoarse.The police grinned but did not interfere . Crowds grew bigger &; bigger . Ruth stayed on the dock , guarding a supply of apples and cigarettes , and watching Ewan 's fitful slumbers . <P> On the third morning , the authorities released Clarin with orders to get out of the country forthwith . Said Ewan as he staggered ashore with a wretched cold : " All feeling has left my legs . " Hoarsely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to await further orders . You will hear more of us . The world government must go on . "
