Said one woman firmly : " I want a Steinway or a mahogany . " <P> When WPB slammed the lid on new piano production last July , the gloom-wrapped industry changed over quickly to making plywood plane parts , deicers . But it kept one eye on the piano market . <P> That market is now hotter than a jump session with Duke Ellington . The new piano supply is close to exhaustion ; prices of used instruments have soared like an upward series of arpeggios . <P> &gt; In New York , dealers are buying every piano they can get their fingers on . They are paying 50 to 100% more than a year ago . After reconditioning , they sell at profits ranging from neat to fabulous . <P> &gt; In Detroit , where showrooms have been bare of new pianos for weeks , tone-tired instruments hardly worth $40 a year ago are now snatched from dealers for $150 . <P> &gt; In Chicago , the market is boiling . Prices of used uprights have doubled to $235 , stocks of the popular new spinets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some stores are rationing them , selling only one a month . Dealers are scouring attics and haunting auctions to pick up stray instruments , are selling them by carloads , sight unseen , to Western and Southern buyers . <P> &gt; In Los Angeles and San Francisco , new pianos are also rationed . Some dealers refuse to sell used instruments , will only rent them . One dealer has 450 rented pianos now out , a waiting list of 50 names and a tidy steady income without the risk of selling himself out of business . <P> Through the Loophole . All new pianos are under strict ceiling prices , but OPA regulations on used ones are vague as a beginner 's fingers . Roughly , a used piano must not be sold for more than it would have brought in March 1942 . But there is a loophole : if a dealer has no basis for comparison , he must abide by what his nearest competitor charges . Thus conservative , well-established houses with a long sales record are neatly tied . But small dealers gaily hop through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they brought new . <P> Feeding the boom are the bulging pay envelopes which have given thousands of Americans the chance to satisfy the musical urge they have always had . <P> Down Profits . WPB 's piano ban was mainly laid down to force the highly skilled piano craftsmen into war work . The shift has been unprofitable , from the management view . Payrolls have risen sharply , but earnings are down . Recently Rudolph Wurlitzer Co. , biggest U.S. maker of pianos , reported a net profit of $1.63 per share for the last fiscal year , way under the $2.48 of 1941 . Only cheer for manufacturers : the thousands of new piano players should make for the greatest market in their history at war 's end .
