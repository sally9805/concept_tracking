A young Harvard-educated prosecutor who likes to think of himself as the Wild West 's Tom Dewey last week could carve four more notches in his briefcase . His victims : Cheyenne , Wyo. ' s mayor , chief of police and two cops . <P> Cheyenne 's dilapidated , frame-built West End district was a wide-open haven for girls , gambling and guzzling until last summer , when Army authorities from nearby Fort Francis E. Warren cracked down . Sin spots went under cover , which meant they had to begin buying protection . Soldiers ( mostly Negroes ) from Fort Warren still had a million-a-month payroll to blow . In sleazy backroom dives , blackjack stakes ran as high as $200 a game . Nightspots bootlegged whiskey because they could not get liquor franchises , limited in Cheyenne to 20 a year and unofficially valued at $50,000 each . Negro service wives were forced to prostitute themselves or be thrown out of their rooms in the congested Negro district . <P> All this became known to blue-eyed , baby-faced Byron Hirst , 31 , the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in on the take , and warned him : " I 'm not interested in being a conquering hero around here , but everybody is beginning to think you 're a crook . " Finally Hirst set a trap . He got the buxom Negro madam of the " Black and Tan Club " to insist on paying off to the mayor and police chief in person . Hirst 's men watched through a peephole , recorded the transaction on a dictograph . Last week Attorney Hirst got his convictions . <P> <P> *Long known , in revenge , as " Little Chicago , " because Chicago in the 1880s named its red-light district " Little Cheyenne .
