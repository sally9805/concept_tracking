In Hollywood 's old , closed circle of major producers the conversation was heavy with trouble . An alarming number of actors , company-bound producers , directors , and even $2,500-a-week writers wanted to become independent producers , too . The reasons were plain : 1 ) taxes had taken the meaning , and the lure , out of high salaries ; 2 ) the booming war market had made it a near impossibility to lose money on any cinema , no matter how inept ; 3 ) the discontented wanted more creative freedom than is offered by the major producers . <P> The battle was not yet fully joined ; the rising independents had their own problems , too . Where , they mourned , was a new producer to find name players ( the real instrument of power in wartime Hollywood ) and where the scarce , raw film ? And if these should be found , as they can , be , how was the producer to find a Broadway theater to spotlight his pictures for the rest of the country ? <P> To this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oldest and foxiest independent moviemakers last week gave an answer that may give other independents an idea . To insure a Broadway outlet for their productions , Producers Samuel Goldwyn* and David Selznick leased Manhattan 's famed , 40-year-old , 1,140-seat Astor Theater from the owner-operator , City Investing Co . Major C. I. request : " Goldwyn &; Selznick keep the Astor as well supplied with pictures as did former tenant Loew 's Inc . <P> Inevitable Growth . Even the independents are ready to admit that this control , which extends to vast chains of theaters all over the U.S. , was an inevitable outcome of the growth of . the movies . Nevertheless , this close harmony has caused the old &; new independents to cry " monopoly . " The U.S. Department of Justice has heard them , and filed an application aimed at forcing the big distributors to sell their theaters within three years , Goldwyn 's The Princess and the Pirate , made last summer , has shown in many a U.S. tank town , and in India and China . But , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RKO , Paramount and Warner Brothers and their theater chains on Manhattan 's first run houses , it has yet to appear on Broadway . thus parting the golden circle . But the final breakthrough will depend on the independents themselves . <P> Their forward echelon is composed of Selznick , Goldwyn and International ( a holding corporation for a number of the newer lone hands , such as Writer Nunnally Johnson , Director Sam Wood and Actor Gary Cooper ) . Other front-rankers are Hunt Stromberg , and ( potentially ) crack Producer-Writer-Director Preston Sturges . <P> Then come the tried and money-wise axis of Walter Wanger , Sol Lesser and Edward Small ; the Crosby , Cagney and Leo ( Going My Way ) McCarey companies ; and many of the profitable B producers . And perennially on the verge of making another picture are such formidable pioneers of independence as Charlie Chaplin and Mary Pickford , who helped found United Artists Corp .
