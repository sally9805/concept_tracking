<P> Have the 177 planes the Army took over from the nation 's airlines been used to full advantage ? For months , in the airlines themselves , there has been a propwash of gossip that the commandeered planes are actually idle , and are rusting away in Army hangars . <P> Last week , with airline operators at their wits ' ends to find equipment to handle their traffic , American Aviation dragged the question into the open : " The other day an airline finally obtained a 14-passenger Lockheed Lodestar that had been in the hands of the Army . . . . The log showed that the airplane had been used an average of 21 minutes a day over a period of 14 months ! Less than one-twentieth of the use that would have been obtained in commercial service . . . . And there is no wastage in Army transport equipment ? " <P> The facts : airline operators are 1 ) correct in assuming that there is some Army waste ; 2 ) wrong in thinking the case of the underworked Lodestar typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army found that countrywide facilities for servicing the Lodestars were sparse . <P> Because of this , the Army has used the Lodestars little , has given the bulk of its transportation job to the famed work horse , the Douglas DC-3 . These have seldom idled in hangars . When a batch of them was returned to an airline recently ( 13 planes have been returned in all ) , airmen were amazed to discover that they had been flown more than nine hours daily , by the Army . This was more than they were flown in peacetime and nearly as much as airline ships get now . <P> The Lodestars have finally been returned to the airlines . But how many DC-3s can be pried loose from the Army in the near future is still an open question .
