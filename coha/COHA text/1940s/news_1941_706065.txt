txt Continuance of Pushcarts Favored The disappearance of pushcarts will be a great loss to many residents of this city . The pushcarts make easily available to purchasers cheap fruit and vegetables , especially such as stores would not care to bother with either because of appearance ( although otherwise in good condition ) or because they must be used immediately . The result will be that a section of the public will be obliged to pay more on the one hand for vegetables and fruit and on the other to support the pushcart men who will be obliged to go on relief . It is objected that the condition of the stables from which pushcart horses are hired is unsanitary . This can not of itself be a valid reason , because for years the milk companies used horses to pull their milk wagons . All that is needed to remedy this defect is periodic inspection of the stables by the city . MARJORIE N. BOYER . New York , Nov. 29 , 1941.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
