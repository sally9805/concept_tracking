Big-city newspapers are usually too busy reporting the deeds and misdeeds of man to pay much attention to the works of nature . But not always . Last week the Boston Herald heaved an editorial sigh for the wintry seashore where " the moving sands swirl up the dunes and out gullied chimney tops . . . This is the time of smoking dunes . " On its good , grave editorial page , the New York Times took note of winter : " Stand by ocean 's edge and you can see , feel , hear and smell the grey waters . This is the darkening interlude when the sea changes its hue and forecasts winter . . . snow . " And the silk-hatted Wall Street Journal stuck a straw in its teeth and complained against the " tenderometer , " a newfangled " diabolical machine that actually proposes to tell a man when his Baldwins . . . and Northern Spies are ripe enough to pick . " <P> Readers might think that these were the nostalgic notes of country-born editorialists , trapped in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavor in the Herald , the Times and the Journal was distilled by one authentic New England countryman . Long-faced Haydn S. Pearson , 47 , is a hard-working naturalist who covers all outdoors , notebook in hand , as methodically as a police reporter on his beat . His nature editorials have offered vicarious trips to the countryside for city-bound readers of the Washington Star , the Newark News and the Indianapolis Star ; 79 papers subscribe to his twice-a-week " Country Flavor Editorial Service . " <P> Walking Man . Pearson* has been studying nature ever since he was six , when his father , a Congregational preacher , began taking him on country strolls around Hancock , N.H. He began writing Sunday features while teaching high-school English at Utica , N.Y. , quit schoolteaching seven years ago to become a full-time nature boy . <P> Once a month , in fair weather or foul , he leaves his home in Waban , a suburb of Boston , for a walking trip in Maine , New Hampshire or Vermont . Dressed in old hiking clothes , he stops to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take careful notes for his editorials . At home , he dutifully keeps up his reading ( botany , ornithology , etc . ) . <P> " One of the things that hurts nature writing the most is sentimentalization , " says Pearson . " I do n't like to write a nature piece without some facts . " He has gathered enough to fill five books ( e.g. , Country Flavor , The Countryman 's Cookbook ) , and has two more on the way . Says he : " There is a place for some quiet writing that will still be true after the screaming headlines are dead . " <P> Sleeping Field . Last week his Country Flavor Editorial Service sent out a quiet piece that illustrated what he meant . Wrote Pearson : " Go to an open ridge on a sunny , crisp January afternoon when the snow blanket is deep and drink of the beauty on white hills . Earth lies patiently sleeping . . . Above walls and fences sumacs hold scraggly arms with faded , brown-flame candles . . . Winter birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hedgerows with their meek ladies . This is the heart of winter . . . but in the tightly wrapped buds is assurance of the Great Promise . " <P> <P> * No kin to Columnist Drew Pearson .
