The burden of offense in Tunisia was hoisted last week on to the shoulders of the British First Army . The Eighth Army , exhausted after two weeks of victory and of eating nothing but glory , cold bully beef , biscuits and tea , rested along 30 miles of a front 150 miles long . The First Army and its attached troops held the rest , and did all of last week 's preparatory fighting . <P> The First Army has none of the veteran arrogance of the mighty Eighth . The First as it now exists is young . It was reorganized , equipped and trained specifically for the North African job . Some of its units are ancient and honorable : such regiments as the Coldstream Guards , the Grenadier Guards , the Lancashire Fusiliers ; but in experience as a single machine fighting the enemy , the First is only as old as the Battle of Tunisia . <P> Blade of Armor . The First began that battle . Lieut . General Kenneth A. N. Anderson and his First Army landed at Algiers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tunisia . Because they could not know what kind of reception they would get , they were long on offensive weapons , short on transport . Nevertheless they threw " a couple of brigades and a blade of armor " toward Tunis . They traveled in two columns . One reached Mateur , the other Tebourba , 20 and 18 miles from Bizerte and Tunis respectively . By then the advance forces had outrun transport and air support so far that they had no punch left . The bold gamble failed . German counter-attacks drove the forces back , and the First Army settled down to a winter term of schooling in warfare . <P> One side , then the other , raided and harassed its enemy during the rainy winter months . In February and March , Arnim launched heavy counter-attacks which drove the British ( and the Americans farther south ) back so that Rommel could crawl into the hills uncrushed . Finally , as the Eighth went to work on the Mareth Line , the First moved forward , this time methodically and to stay . In its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can do its jobs . <P> Reticent Man . The First 's commander , Kenneth Arthur Noel Anderson , is a formal , frugal , unglamorous Scot who has been somewhat eclipsed for the outside public by the brilliant commanders above and around him in Tunisia , and for his own troops by his brilliant juniors within the First Army . He speaks fluent French , and his French subordinates like his Scottish mentality . <P> The Noel in his name is for his birthday - Christmas , 1891 . He was born in India , educated at Charterhouse and Sandhurst , fought and was wounded in World War I , fought in World War II from the Saar to Dunkirk . He has a Scot 's reticence which even his wife can not penetrate . <P> Wild and Angry Man . Kenneth Anderson has the delicate job of commanding various attached troops , both French and U.S. So far he has won their loyalty .
