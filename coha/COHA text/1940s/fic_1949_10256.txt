. He would take his time over breakfast and dressing and reading his mail , and by the time he was ready for the street he had smoked half a dozen Sweet Caporals ; they were not fashionable cigarettesbut when you inhaled one you knew it . Eleven o'clock had always struck before Brock was ready for his walk , which took him north on Second Street and south on Front Street , along the river , and in-shore again to the Fort Penn Club , where Brock spent most of his days . Before he was twenty-five he was already a fixture there ; the tiny white wooden peg beside a member 's name , which indicated that the member was in the club , was in the hole beside Brock 's name earliest and longest of all on the roster . He and Fairfax , the shining black servant who took hats and coats and checked in the members , would exchange only the most perfunctory greetings , as though they were saying , " I 'm here , Fairfax , " " I see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters from his box , answer them in the library , and it would be time to join the round table at lunch , and then all afternoon he would play pool or whist until the drinkers dropped in for their glasses of whiskey . The bar was small , hardly more than a service bar ; most men had done a day 's work and preferred to sit at tables . A head of cheese , crackers , salted peanuts , and hard pretzels were the free lunch , placed on lazy-susans on the larger tables . Brock always sat at the same table , always sat with the downrivergun-club group , who were younger members of the Fort Penn club and content not to mingle with the oldsters . They shook dice to see who would sign for the afternoon whiskeys , and every afternoon Brock would walk home accompanied by the same two men , Charlie Jay and Duncan Partridge , who lived near him , and who were his best friends . When he dined at home Brock would sit with his mother and father , and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club to play pool or cards . his father would read the paper and smoke a cigar , and his mother somehow , somehow made conversation . She would have husband and son holding a tape measure for new curtains ; she could stretch out a discussion of Brock 's shirt supply to twenty minutes ; she had a letter from a cousin ; she lost an umbrella ; the cook 's brother was caught between cars in the railroad yards . The discussion  --  and she had the knack of making her listeners ' participationeasy  --  was rarely about anything that was not related to the two houses and the people who lived in them . ( When she died Brock said to Grace , " Mother never seemed to talk about anything but spools of thread and where she left her glasses , but I always listened . " ) 40The hour would pass and Brock would say : " I 'll be at the ( lob M anything comes up . " This was a family joke : it had begun as a held , ish mimicry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tune It was dropped even before Brock went away to boarding-school , and everybody forgot it until one evening shortly after Mr. Caldwell had admitted defeat in the campaign to make Brock a business man . Brock suddenly remembered the line , spoke it , and the laugh that followed made for a friendlier atmosphere , although both Brock and his father were conscious of the sad finality in the disinterred joke . He would not kiss his mother or say good night to her or to Grace or to his father ; they all pretended that Brock was only going for a stroll to stretch his legs , the way older men of the period would talk about going down to the corner for a cigar . But they all knew that Brock was gone for the evening and they all knew that many nights he only got home because he had been carried . In this period William Caldwell once said to his wife when they were alone : " To all intents and purposes Brock is as old as General Doerflinger . " " General Doerflinger was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a day . " " I know . But I still say . . . General Doerflinger married Mrs. What's-Her-Name only about ten years ago . He still takes an active interest in a great number of things , like the G. A. R. , and the bank , rides a horse in parades . He tries to keep young , the old General . But Brock , Brock 's a mystery to me . He has no ambition , Emily ; you ca n't argue with me on that . " " He has the history . " " Well  --  yes . Yes , he has that . " The history of which Emily was speaking was a project which did not so much disrupt Brock 's way of life as complement it . Only a man with the time to spare and no money worries could undertake to write a history of his family , and at irregular intervals Brock would spend three or four days among old letters , family Bibles , headstones , diaries , parish records , receipted bills and county papers . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Washington 's Birthday : " George Washington . . . My grandfather , you children 's great-grandfather , shook hands with George Washington . And my great-grandfather , your great-great-grandfather , probably saddled his horse , polished his boots , all sorts of things . I remember my grandfather'smentioning that Washington either spent the night or at ; my rate had a meal at his father 's house , down-river at what used to he41Uncle Ben 's farm before he died . Washington was on his way home from that time he was with Braddock , General Braddock . Now of course those old people , I s'pose they had a way of remembering things that did n't happen sometimes , but Grandfather was usually reliable . Is n't that interesting , though ? Us sitting here , and we had two ancestors that at least they had some connection with the father of our country ? Touched him . I think it 's interesting , and I 've always meant to look into it more thoroughly . And of course it was my grandfather , Elias Caldwell , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy in his teens , but he got in , carried a musket . " " I never heard you talk about this , Father , " said Grace . " Oh , I have , " said Brock . " You know , I have a notion to read up on some of those things . It might be interesting to write a kind of a history . " " Yes . Of course the only way to do it is do it honestly . Do n't cut corners , or leave out the bad parts . For instance , Brock , I know for a fact , both your mother 's side of the family and mine had Tories . You have to be prepared for some unpleasant surprises . And the religious aspect . Both sides used to be staunch Quakers , and the Caldwells have n't been for  --  well , our branch , not in my lifetime . I guess it was my grandfather that changed , if he went to war . The Quakers , nat urally , they were opposed to war , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objection to my working on a history ? " " Notta tall . Far from it . I 'll be glad to help , any way I can , so will your mother , wo n't you dear ? " " I 'll write to the Norrstown branch tomorrow , " said Mrs. Caldwell . That was the start of Brock 's project , which he carried on for the remainder of his life . It was a genteel occupation , that of writing a family history . ' I'o family friends Brock became known as a writer . That covered up his not going into business or the law or medicine ; kindly members of the older generation persuaded themselves that Brock worked every morning from sunrise to noon , and it was not easy for anyone not in the Caldwell household to prove that such was not the case . The task he had set himself also excused him from social chores : " I 'm awfully sorry , Mrs. Zumbach , " he would say , " but a week from Thursday I 'll be in Philadelphia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schmidt . You know  --  my scribbling . " Mrs. Zumbach would be understanding about Brock 's scribbling . Moreover , it would have been impolitic not to be understanding with a young man who was writing a book that involved so much digginginto the past ; in 1902 too many Fort Penn families became with the knowledge that a rich , secure , and rather cold youngwas believed to be thumbing over birth certificates , marriage oedl and documents of that sort . A single generation was as far bat k AI many of them hoped he would go , and they were quite corn ( t m their alarm . When he did create time to delve into the records Brock came up with some amusing , unpleasant facts to be enjoyed with Charlie Jay and Duncan Partridge . Nor was he above inventing de tails concerning the ancestry of Partridge and jay themselves . He told each separately and privately that he , Partridge or Jay , had Negroblood . He enjoyed their dismay for a day or two before confessing to the fiction . The joke almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the three . ( They were known as the ThreeMusketeers without further specific identification , although Brockmight have been called the Athos , Duncan the Porthos , and Charlie the Aramis . ) When Brock admitted that he had been joshing Duncanabout his Caucasianism , Duncan said , " You 're a thorough son of a bitch . " " You have to take that back , or we 're quits . " Duncan thought a moment . " I take it back . I admire your mother . But you , you 're a  --  well , no use calling names . Childish . But imaginegoing to all that trouble to make somebody believe he was part coon . I do n't see anything funny in it . " " I did the same thing to Charlie , and he thought it was funny when I told him . He got the joke . " " Well , Charlie 's more like you anyway , " said Duncan . " Is that supposed to be an insult to Charlie ? " " No , you know I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say to a man I 'll tell it to his face . If I ca n't take care of myself I 'll keep my mouth shut or take my beating , one or the other . " " Oh , balls , Duncan , you have no sense of humor . " " If it takes a sense of humor to treat it as a joke when one of your best friends tells you you 're part nigger and then admits he made it up , that 's not my idea of a sense of humor . " " Balls . You 're not above practical jokes yourself . Do n't be so highand mighty . You go in for more horseplay than anybody else in the gun club . " " Nobody minds a little rough-housing , " said Duncan . " That 's fun . " " A broken arm 's no fun . " This was a reference to Brock 's going through the boatlanding at the club when he stepped on a two-byfourthat Duncan had sawn . " Well , I was always sorry about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sorry you could n't take a joke when I played one . " " I can take a joke . . . Oh , balls , " said Duncan . His father 's forensic ability had not been handed down to him . Charlie Jay , as Brock pointed out , had taken the joke more gracefully . Charlie , as Duncan pointed out , was more like Brock anyway . Charlie was the youngest of the three , nearly two years younger than Brock . Duncan was a big man , who had been a rusher on the Yale team ; Brock was between tall and short ; Charlie was the same height as Brock , but slender and strong and fast . He could keep his hands to his sides and challenge Duncan to land a blow on his face . He loved violence and one of his favorite jokes was to dress like a dude  --  not too radical a change from his customary style  --  and go to a Shoptown saloon and pretend to be an effeminate . He would simulate a lisp and say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until someone from the railroad took exception to his existence , whereupon Charlie would cut the man 's eye and cheekbones with his fists , which were armored with a heavy signet ring on each hand , hidden by the fawn-colored gloves that were part of his get-up . He also knew the technique of the knee in the groin followed by butting the workman 's chin . He also knew discretion ; he never stacked the odds too high against himself . Before he pretended to be a sissy he would have studied the saloon 's customers and the distance to the door , and on these excursions he carried a shot-and-leather truncheon , which he knew how to use . Brock never went along on these visits to Shoptown . IIe kept away from fist fights ; he had neither the inclination to get into them or the ability to get out of them . But he liked to hear about them . It is possible that if Brock had not given his implied approval by listening to Charlie 's stories , Charlie , with his awe of Brock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have kept silent about them . He worshipped Brock . Charlie 's father had been struck by lightning at a picnic when Charlie was four years old , and Mrs. Jay , though not poverty-stricken , was not rich . It was a great help to have the two boys play together , to know that Charlie would be brought home from Second Street every afternoon in the Caldwell carriage , and to have him spend his summers on the Caldwell farm . On the farm Charlie made the same pretense of work that Mr. Caldwellrequired of Brock  --  killing potato bugs , holding the reins during the haying , whitewashing fences , skimming milk , pumping water , picking berries , tending the cows . Their companionship had a setback when Brock became thirteen and kept secret the developments in himself that Charlie , who had talked about girls and women and men incessantly , had been anticipating . Charlie bored Brock . But Charlie underwent the same changes within a year and after that the difference in their ages was never important again . Brock went to boarding school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was ready to go to college , so that the difference in their school classes was not continually reminding them of the difference in age . It turned out that Charlie entered Lehigh the same year Brock entered Princeton . By that time they had their secret , which was so secret that neither boy ever spoke of it so long as they lived . One day during a Christmas vacation , when Brock was home from his last year at Lawrenceville , the two were in Brock 's room in the Second Street house . Brock was then eighteen , Charlie was sixteen . The snow had turned to rain , the streets were slush and mud , the river was not safe for skating , and there was no party for boys their age . Brock was smoking his first pipe , which was sanctioned by his father , to destroy the smell of the cigarettes he and Charlie had been smoking . Charlie had admired the new suit and shoes and necktiesthat Brock had brought home , they had had root beer and a plate of sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of conversational topics . They heard the front door close . They looked out the window and saw the Caldwell brougham driving away . " That 's Grace , " said Brock . " Is it ? " said Charlie . " Uh-huh . " " What 's she doing ? " said Charlie . " I do n't know , and care less . " " Tell her to come on up . " " What for ? " said Brock . " Go on , tell her to come up . " " I do n't want her up here . I distinctly forbid her to ever come in this room . " " Go on , we can have some fun . " " You 're crazy in the head , " said Brock . " You ought a see her . She thinks she 's the belle of the ball . " " That 's what I mean , we can have some fun . " 44 45 " No , I told her to keep out of my way and she told me to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or I 'll spend you . ' I said . " " Where is she now ? " " I guess she 's in her room . " " Let 's go down there and have some fun . " " What kind of fun can you have with a snotty **27;4514;TOOLONG ? " " Let 's sneak down . Everybody 's out except the maids down in thekitchen . Are you game ? " " What do you want to sneak down for ? " " Did you ever see her undressed ? " " Sure . " " Since you came home ? " " No . " " Do you know what ? I 'll bet she 's just like that girl I told youabout . You know . L. W. She 's fourteen . " " You 're crazy in the head . " " You do n't have to go in her room . You can stay outside andlisten if somebody comes . " " While you do what ? " " L. W. 's coming to my house again . Soon . Very soon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me now . I did n't tell you all aboutL . W. either . " " What do you want to do ? " " Just have some fun . I wo n't hurt her or anything . " Charlie gotup and left the room and Brock followed . They made no sound and Charlie did not look back or hesitate . He quietly opened the door of Grace 's room and closed it behind him . Brock listened , and he couldhear them . " Charlie Jay ? What are you doing ? Get out of my room . " " Do you want me to help you , Grace ? " " Stay away , now , Charlie . " " I 'll go if you give me a kiss . " " I will not , give you a kiss . Give me my bathrobe . I 'll call Julie . " I do n't care . I can be out of here before she gets here . " " I 'll call Brock . " " Brock 's outside the door , guarding . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me a kiss , Grace . " " Will you go if I give you a kiss ? " " Word of honor . " " All right . Just one kiss and then you have to go , but first give me back my bathrobe . " " Here you are . " " Charlie ! " " Please , Grace ! I love you ! Grace ! " Brock knocked on the door but there was no answer , and he found when he turned the knob that Charlie had slid the bolt . He knocked again and this time Charlie opened the door . " What did you do ? " said Brock . Charlie did not answer him , but ran downstairs and Brock heard him slam the door . Grace was on the bed . " Were you there all the time ? " " I swear , Grace  --  " " Go away , you coward . I 'll never speak to you again . " During the remainder of the Christmas vacation Brock made no effort to see Charlie . They spoke when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then while Brock was back at Lawrenceville he had a letter from his mother in which she commented that she thought it was nice that Grace had invited Charlie as her guest at the Washington'sBirthday tea party of Miss Holbrook 's School , which was held in the Parish House of St. Paul 's Church . That , Brock tried to tell himself , proved that Charlie had not been nasty . It did not prove that he had not seen Grace lying naked on her bed . And whatever it did or did not prove , he never got another of Grace 's silly weekly letters . Mrs. Caldwell observed to her husband that Charlie Jay was a littleold for Grace , belonged to an older crowd , but that it was all right to have him bring her home from dancing school and the few parties to which both were invited . She also gave her permission when Charlie asked Grace to be his guest at the Mercersburg  --  Fort Penn Academy baseball game , and Spring Day at the Academy . " I do n't want her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl , " said Emily Caldwell . " Yes , I s'pose times are changing all the time , " said William Caldwell . " And Charlie 's a good boy . He 's industrious , a good worker on the farm . Not a shirker . " " Brock is n't a shirker , Will , if that 's what you 're trying to say but wo n't say . Brock 's just a different type than boys nowadays . I think Brock may have the artistic temperament . " " He may have , he may very well have , but not the art to go with it . Oh , Brock 'll be all right . I 'm not complaining . But speaking of theartistic temperament , Brock does n't even play the piano , and Charlie does ! And Charlie 's very clever with the pencil , you know . He does all the drawings for the Academy paper . " " Well , this discussion 's wandering all over the lot , helter-skelter . I started out worried you might disapprove of Charlie and Grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see I need n't have worried . Well , that 's one thing less to worry about . " " Yes , dear . " " And these , I do n't know what to call them  --  crushes ? I ca n't say for certain that it 's gone as far as a crush , or puppy-love , or whatever you want to call it . But these uh , friendships ! Friendships ! Unless there 's something solid they soon evaporate and young people forget all about one another . " " You 're the one that sounds worried , Emily . " " Oh , I 'm not . I 'm just thinking out loud , as it were . " The friendship was terminated by a shrewd woman who understoodher own son because she had had to understand his father . Jessie Jay was not a religious woman , but the bolt of lightning that killed her husband and the father of her little boy made her wonder . She did not hold with the theory of the outraged , vengeful God , and yet there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the picnic who had it coming to him  --  for Charlie 's father was a great womanizer . Jessie Jay had had anonymous letters to that effect , and not that she needed them . By the time Charlie entered his teens most people who knew seemed to have forgotten that his father had been a ne'r-do-well . The spectacular fact of his death had become the thing he was remembered by . But no child , rich or poor , in Fort Penn , had been brought up under such vigilance as Charlie , and the relationship between the Jay and the Caldwell family was so precious that Jessie would becomeill at the thought that something might occur to endanger it . The morning after Spring Day Jessie gave Charlie his breakfast . " Do n't leave the house till I 've had a talk with you , " she said . " I 'm going upstairs to make the beds . You stay here . " " Is n't Willomena coming today ? " said Charlie . " She is n't coming today , " said Jessie . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures of track and field athletes . She sat across the table from him and folded her hands . " You can stop that now . I want your full atten-tion. " 48 " What 's the matter , Mud ? " " I want no lies . I want the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , so help you God . " " I did n't do anything . Why 're you taking on this way , like a judge or something ? " " What have you been doing with Grace Caldwell ? . . . Oh , does n't that bring the color to our cheeks ! " " I do n't know what you mean , Ma . I swear I do n't . " She slapped his face hard , and he jumped up . " I said do n't lie to me , you contemptible , ungrateful thing . What have you been doingwith Grace Caldwell ?

The water was running in the tub . " " What did you do ? " " I told her I wanted a kiss and she said she 'd give me a kiss if Iwent out right away .

He wrote a letter to Grace before he left but he did not give it to her or send it as he might have done , through Connie Schoffstal , Grace 's best friend . With his fear of his mother in those remaining weeks in Fort Penn it was an act of courage for Charlie to write the letter , but he did not trust Connie Schoffstal or anyone else , and the letter lasted only one day before he tore it into small scraps and flushed it down the toilet . In Ohio , so far away from Fort Penn and Grace , he first hated his mother before he began to realize that no33 " Where was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're going to be punished , but you 're going to be punished a great deal more severely if you do n't tell me everything .

She rested her head on her hand and looked out the kitchen window . " Oh , Lord . Men , " she said . She stood up and went to the kitchen door , her gaze fixed on the garden . " I have my plans , too , " she said . " You can forget yours . I 'm not going to ask you to do any of these things .

Willomcna had become a threat and a nuisance ; twice she had come to his room wearing one of his mother 's rings and it probably would have been only a question of days before she stole it . And in their intimacy she had grown demanding . " I make you feel good , next time you gon na make me feel good or no more , Mistah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all he had to do was to brush against her in the hall and she would come to him the first chance she got ; on the other hand , every minute she was in the house he was trying to get near her to start her feeling that way , and sooner or later they would do what she wanted and then there would be hell to pay , a knockedupservant girl , which was not the rarest event in Fort Penn history , but boys were supposed to keep their hands off colored girls , and seldom confided in each other when they violated the rule . Charlie , in his tales of experiences with " L. W. , " had pretended she was a white girl and Brock had gone through the Blue Book and the telephonedirectory , in his eagerness to identify " L. W. " Sooner or later , Charlie reminded himself in Ohio , Brock would have figured out that L. W. was Willomena , and then Brock would have had the goods on him for fair . The two boys came out about even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the injured brother , but he had stood guard . In his meetings with Grace it was he who always wanted what Willomena wanted from him and it was Grace who was terrified of the consequences . In Ohio , going back in detailed recollection of each of their most recent meetings , he could see how Grace had been weakening little by little , and Charlie was sure that if he had gone to the Caldwell farm and kept the trysts they had planned he probably would have become a father at sixteen , and if that had ever happened in Fort Penn , at least among the people he knew , he never had heard of it . Charlie came back from Ohio stronger , tanned , and handsomer , and with an excellent mental attitude : he had saved thirty dollars out of the pay his uncle gave him ; he had had a summer free of woman worries , and that was a debt he owed his mother , which he repaid by according her a new respect . The fear of his mother had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie 's life . Grace had some pimples on her chin and forehead for the last month of school that term ; her appetite was bad and she seemed to prefer solitude to the company of her family and friends . Her mother54guessed that a change had occurred in Grace 's life and she went to her daughter with the intention of confiding the briefest possible explanation of that change . Grace was leaning on the window-sill in the upstairs sitting-room . " Are n't you feeling well , dear ? " " I 'm all right , " said Grace . " Is it something you ate ? " " No , Mother . It could n't be . I did n't eat anything to speak of . " " I noticed that . Your appetite has n't been good lately . I wish we could have gone to the farm sooner but the plumbers wo n't be fin ished till next week . It was so cold this spring , was n't it ? Colder than we usually get in April and May . " " Yes . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll get more fresh air . Fresh air 's really good for you . And Brock 'll be home and you two can ride , get exercise . Father 's talking about taking up riding again . Wo n't that be nice ? " " Mother , could n't we go some place else this summer ? " " Why you love the farm , Grace . You 've always loved it . You and Father 've always been the ones can hardly wait . " " I do love it , Mud . But I wish we could go some place else this summer . Were you ever at Cape May ? New Jersey ? " " No , although it 's said to be nice . But I do n't think you could ride there . " " I was n't thinking of riding . " " Have you lost interest in riding , Grace ? " " Not exactly . I was thinking of some place different . I have n't seen the Atlantic Ocean since I was little . It is n't anything against riding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  your not feeling well . Sometimes you 're not going to be able to ride . Did you know that ? I do n't mean that you 'll be forbidden . But for health reasons . Girls every girl , every girl in the world , mind you  --  there 's a change in you , sometimes it happens when you 're fourteen , thirteen , fifteen , sixteen . Sometimes earlier . You 'll notice that when you go to the bathroom  --  " " Do n't talk about it , Mother . I know . The period . " " Yes , but how did you know ? " said Mrs. Caldwell . " Who told you ? Connie ? " " No . Julie . " " I-Iow did Julie happen to tell you ? " " Do n't be cross with Julie , Mud . Last summer I did n't feel well55and when she brought me my tea and toast she  --  told me . She said sometimes mothers forget to tell their daughters and she thought I ought to know . So I know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about men ? Boys ? " " Oh , heavens , no , Mother . What does she know about boys ? A face that would stop a clock . Julie 's nice , but she could n't know anything about boys . " " I beg to differ with you . Julie does know about boys . She 's a widow , that means she was married once  --  but never mind aboutJulie . " " All right , I 'll never mind about Julie . I do n't want to talk about her . You asked me , you know , Mother . You were the one that asked . " " Well , I do n't want her to talk about boys , and if she ever does , you stop her . When you announce your engagement  --  " " Announce my engagement ! Mother , please leave me alone , will you please ? May I be excused ? I want to take a nap . " Grace did not wait for permission ; she hurried out of the room . Mrs. Caldwell took Grace to Cape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousins and met more cousins and non-cousinly Pennsylvanians . Grace learned to swim in the surf for the first time and to play tennis on clay courts . The cold fresh-water dam on the farm and the grass tennis court and the Fort Penn friends and the house on the farm were different enough from Cape May to make Cape May seem more different than it was , and thus a desirable place for a vacation . It was decided that the next summer the Caldwells would rent a cottage of their own , and so it turned out that each summeruntil she was engaged to be married Grace visited Cape May with her mother and father , thereby slightly widening her circle of acquaintances , and providing her with a geographical topic when her Fort Penn companions talked about Eagles Mere , Martha 's Vineyard , Watkins Glen , and Asbury Park . After that first visit to Cape May Grace became closer friends than ever with Connie Schoffstal , the younger sister of Ham Schoffstal . The Schoffstal family branch of which Ham and Connie were members was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who carried the entire Schoffstal vote would have had a head start on almost any other candidate . There were Schoffstals in townshipswhere there were no Schmidts or Hoffmans or Steins or Millers , and when a Miller or a Stein or a Hoffman or a Schmidt married a Schoffstal , he too became a Schoffstal . The Miller or Schmidt did not change his name ; he did n't have to . It was known that he had married56a Schoffstal , and a man 's standing in his township or borough sometimeswas determined by the closeness or remoteness of his kinship with the Fort Penn Schoffstals , and particularly the Isaac Schoffstals , who were the parents of Connie and Ham . In the city of Fort Penn no Schoffstal was out of work . Isaac Schoffstal saw to that . Isaac could not help it that there was a Schoffstal from down-river way who was in Nesquehela County Prison , Fort Penn , on a manslaughter conviction , the outcome of his having severed his wife 's head with a sickle . That is what some people said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inaccurate . A few , more accurate , pointed out that Isaac could help it , did help it . If the man had n't been a Schoffstal , with his plight called to Isaac 's attention , and Isaac 's reaching into his pocket for a lawyer , the man would be in the graveyard , not the stoney-lonesome . Isaac never had seen the uxoricide , but to his knowledge and belief no Schoffstal ever had been hanged and none would be if he could help it . Any Schoffstal who came to Fort Penn , who was clean and neat and had a letter , preferably from the Lutheranpastor , was helped . he did not always get to meet Isaac , but after investigation Isaac 's head bookkeeper or someone else in Isaac 's office arranged for the newcomer to meet someone who would provide a job . In Fort Penn alone there was a Schoffstal at every little step , all the way up . There was a Schoffstal a crossing watchman for the Nesquehela , Fort Penn &; Lebanon . Crossing watchman jobs usuallywere reserved for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but an exception was made for this Schoffstal , and he had the nicest arrangement of flowers and oyster shells around his watch-box on the whole N. F. P. &; L. ( sometimes called the Nesquie Falter , Pause and Linger ) . The Schoffstal family were represented in the Lutheran Churches of Fort Penn by a sexton and a pastor . There was no Schoffstalon the staff of the Schoffstal House , an Isaac Schoffstal holding , but it would not have been appropriate to have a close relation in the hotel business , at least in a hotel which was being carried at a loss against the day when it would be torn down to make way for a firstclasshotel or office building . There was no Schoffstal in the Police Department . There was , however , a Schoffstal who was a tipstaff at the Court House ; a Schoffstal was deputy sheriff in the same building ; a Schoffstal was assistant county superintendent of schools and there were two Schoffstals on the teaching roster . Herman Schoffstal gave piano and violin lessons at his home in South Sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was head occupant of the console ( although not a member of the Roman church ) . 57Herman was an active figure at the Bach festivals in Bethlehem , Pa. , and one of his daughters was on the faculty of the New England Conservatory . Another Schoffstal was watch inspector for the Altoona division of the Pennsy , and one of his sons taught higher mathematics at Fort Penn University while another was engaged in painting and paperhanging . A Schoffstal was boss of the open hearth at the Fort Penn Central Iron &; Steel Company mills . These and many more Schoffstals always went out of their way to speak to Isaac , and no matter what their ages , they all would say , " Good morning , Uncle Isaac , " and he would return the greeting , often without a very good idea of which Schoffstal he was speaking to , but comfortably aware from the other 's form of address that it was one of the family . Isaac , they used to say , was all business . The firm name , Schoffstal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nineteenth century . In its day it had dealt in gunpowder , muskets , clothing , horses , tallow , seeds , paint , farm equipment , lumber , building materials , farm land , produce , letters of credit , real estate , steamship tickets , stocks , bonds , and insurance . In 1902 110 one came in to the Schoffstal &; Company office to buy a flintlock or a toe-jabber , but Schoffstal &; Company would have found the rifle or the knife for a steady customer . The offices were on the street floor of the Schoffstal Building , at the corner of State and Second Streets . The lettering on the two large windows said Schoffstal &; Company and no more . The officeswere divided by the lobby of the building : on the east side , where the light was better , were the cashier and his assistants and bookkeepers and typists . On the other side were the members of the firm , consisting of Isaac Schoffstal and his brother-in-law , Philip S. Hamilton , and his brother William Schoffstal , in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . A green silk curtain hung across the window at a height that made it awkward for passers-byto see what was going on at Isaac 's fenced-off desk , but Isaac could stand near the window and look out on the street . The arrangementwas in no sense accidental . Isaac , arranging for the lay-out of the offices , said of his own : " I do business out in the open . The whole world can look in if they want to and see who comes to talk with me . " That was not strictly true . In order to obtain a good look at whoever was doing business with Isaad , a representative of the whole world would have had to stop at the window , stand on tip-toe , and stretch his neck for a view of the occupant of the chair beside Isaac 's desk , which was in the corner of Second and State. 58Isaac was a capitalist , a private banker . He took calculated risks that commercial banks were prevented from taking by law . He was licensed to sell insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had exactly the same right to sell steamship tickets and letters of credit as G. Locatelli , who sold fruit and vegetables and olive oil , and held the savings of his Tenth Street neighbors until they had enough to send to the Old Country for the Old Woman . Locatelli had a small safe , Schoffstal had a large vault . William Caldwell and Isaac Schoffstal were the first Fort Penn residents to break the custom of going home for " lunch "  --  the first , that is , of the men who did not carry their lunch to work . Both men had houses within walking distance of their places of business , but the Fort Penn Club was beginning to catch on ; men from Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and Reading and Allentown were at the club every day while the Legislature was in session , and William and Isaac agreed that it seemed a pity not to meet those fellows and exchange views . There were views to be exchangedon doings in the locomotive industry , for instance , which Philadelphia fellows knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bituminous and iron pulse , and the Scranton  --  WilkesBarrefellows had their fingers on the anthracite pulse . The Reading and Allentown men had views on textiles and cement and railroad equipment . It was Isaac who had the idea of lunching at the club , and Will who did the agreeing . They made many valuable friendshipsby establishing the new lunch custom , and without intending to do so , they effected a revolutionary change in the social life of Fort Penn : when other men saw Isaac and Will lunching downtown , they too took up the custom , and their wives , who had been hoping for an excuse for evening dinner , enthusiastically approved . Isaac 's wife told Emily Caldwell that " We 're getting just like Philadelphia . " Ahead of its time , compared with other cities of equal size , Fort Penn went in for a metropolitan social life , with consequent prosperity for dressmakers , tailors , shoemakers , and jewelers at home and away . The proven plays of William Shakespeare , and the Philadelphia Opera Company enjoyed unprecedented patronage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier than on any previous winter appearance . The luncheon innovation was one of the few in its category not to have originated with a member of the Caldwells , and the only one attributable to Isaac Schoffstal or a member of his family . The Caldwellswere money-conservative and more progressive in their social59habits and the clothes they wore . In actual fact the Caldwells often had entertained at evening dinner ; but they generally observed Fort Penn custom . Isaac Schoffstal would have been incredulous if it had been suggested that his occasionally unorthodox business philosophy had been matched by his becoming a social innovator . It was not the Schoffstals ' way . Isaac was a kind and kindly man outside of business . Ile had inherited money , name , and connections , which were useful and compatible with his acquisitive instinct , and deals were his fun . HIe had pride of family , as evidenced by his taking care of obscure relatives , but better demonstrated by his attitude toward his wife and children . They had , in the words of the old exaggeration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the new thing had to be carried or worn or otherwise enjoyed , and thus approved , by others before he would buy it . In most cases it was sufficient for wife or child to point out that the Caldwells had given their approval of the carriage or the cloak or the porch or the journey . Isaac probably was merely protecting himself and his own against the ridicule that the innovator risks . This attitude and practice did not protect him and his own against the lifelong charge that the Schoffstals imitated the Caldwells in all things . It was said by the unkind that the Schoffstalsdid n't dare to take a leak unless the Caldwells took one first . The charge was made that the Schoffstals did n't think any butter was good unless it had been churned at the Caldwell farm . ( It was true that Riverside Farm butter , eggs , and milk were delivered daily to the Schoffstal home . ) A casual overheard question  --  " Do you still buy your clothes in Philadelphia ? "  --  had people saying that Ham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And when Fort Penn gossips declared that Connie Schoffstal was trying to be like Grace Caldwell , they had something to go on . The girls were only months apart in age . Grace was born in April , Connie in February . Grace had not selected Connie to be her companion . It was only that Connie was always there , and always had been . Afternoons , after school , Connie would not go home to her own house ; she went to Grace 's . Even when Connie had a new toy or a new hair ribbon she would bring it to the Caldwells ' house rather than risk Grace 's refusal to go to the Schoffstals ' . Connie would sit on the floor while Grace , a non-gregarious child anyway , worked a puzzle . Connie would sit in the parlor while Grace practised her scales . Connie would hear Grace 's lessons , but Grace would not hear Connie 's . " I 'll get it , I 'll get it , " Connie was always saying . " I 'll do it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll turn it , I 'll kill it , I 'll tie it , I 'll get it . " Connieanticipated when she could , gave when she could , and was alwan s there . She had been there if Grace had wanted to tell her anything or everything about what happened between her and Charlie Jay , butGrace told her nothing , not then , not ever . Connie knew something was wrong , then right , then wrong again , and she knew she was being kept out of a secret which engaged Grace and Charlie , but there again Connie was fearful of a lasting rebuff , and she never asked Grace about Charlie . Connie 's common sense and her affection for Grace told her that the sudden visit to Cape May had something todo with Charlie , and she was determined to be helpful when Grace got back . She risked one question : " Were any of those cousins boys ? " Yes , boys , and men . A dandy swimmer who went to Episcopal Academy , a ducky tennis player who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football at Penn . They had all been nice to her andin four years when she had her ball  --  Fort Penn girls and their parents did not employ the term " corning-out party "  --  she hoped they wouldall come . And she had seen others besides cousins ; the cousins had friends , naturally . Practically all of the boys smoked cigarettes ; someof them even smoked cigarettes at home . She herself had taken a few puffs every time the tennis player dropped in at the house where she was staying . Grace 's smoking was almost enough of a confession to satisfy Connie 's need for something secret to share with Grace . Almost . Shewanted to ask Grace if she had been given any presents by cousins or cousins ' friends , or if she had promised to write , but those secrets hadto be free-will offerings . T'he smoking was a wonderful secret , properlyappreciated by Connie , and Grace would tell what she had totell when she was good and ready . Until then Connie was delighted to be paying a long visit at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made a pretense of learning to cook , climbed trees , sat in the hammocks , waded in the creek , drove the new cob in the buckboard to Becksville , two miles away , for milk chocolate ; attended the Lutheranchurch in Becksville , watched the threshers for a little while every day for a week , tried on old dresses of Emily Caldwell 's , helped put up preserves , smoked cigarettes , hunted chicken eggs , polished silver , rode the hay-wagon and the drag sled , killed a copperhead , went to bed soon after supper and had breakfast at eight , and spoke of the future . Neither of the girls knew much about boarding schools but Grace was firmly convinced that she would not go to one . " It 'd be the sameas Miss Holy 's , only at boarding school I always heard they feed you pig slops , and open your letters . Did you ever know that , Connie ? At boarding school they open your letters that you send and the ones you get . Fancy that ! At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's private correspondence . " " But I think I 'd like to go to one for a year . " " What for , may I ask ? " " To see what it 's like . " " Mon Dieu ! I 've told you what it 's like . Pig slops and openingyour letters . A person is entitled to their privacy . " " But Grace , do n't you ever want to leave Fort Penn ? Dear me . " " No . Except the Grand Tour . When I 'm twenty-five I 'll take theGrand Tour . And I 'd like to open my own charge account in New York for clothes , but I would n't think of living in Europe . Just Cape May every summer . I remember when I went to New York that time . Mon Dieu ! The fishy smell on the ferryboat , and we were up on the top ! And where you get off and take the carriage to go to the hotel . You ca n't cross the street on account of the drays and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man arrested but he could n't find a policeman . In Fort Penn nobody ever beat a horse in front of father . I learned my lesson . When we had to go across the HudsonRiver again I held my sachet to my nose . " In the weeks of Connie 's visit they had only one quarrel . Thethreshers went from farm to farm , each farmer helping out his neighbors . The first two days of the week were spent at the Caldwell farm because there was more grain to be threshed there . Most of the mendid not remember Grace from other summers , but they remembered her every time she appeared after that . On the last day , Saturday , one of them called out to another over the noise of the threshing ma-chine : " Wie daitscht gleicha fer in iera tzwivvela bet mum grawva ? " The second man replied : " 011 recht , fer vas frogha mier sie net ? " All who heard laughed and stared at Grace . They had stared before , but one at a time ; now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she picked up the reins she asked Connie what the men hadsaid . " You understand Dutch . " " I could n't quite hear them . " " You 're a liar . You know what they said . Tell me . " " I could n't  --  " " Do you swear on your honor ? Thev were talking about me and Iwant to know what they said . I insist ! " 62 " Well , the man with the handkerchief over his face  --  " " Do you know him ? " " Of course not , how would I know these farmers ? You ought to . " " I could n't tell for sure with the handkerchief over his face . What did he say ? " " Please , Grace , you 'll hate me worse if I do tell you than if I do n't . " " I said I insist . If you do n't tell me I 'll ask you to pack up and go home , and never come to our farm again or our house . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would like to get in bed with you . " " Is that what he said ? What did the other say ? " " The other said why did n't he ask you , maybe you 'd like to . " Grace was silent a moment . " What made them say that ? What else did they say ? " " I did n't listen , I was so disgusted . " " Were you ? " " Yes , do n't you know what they mean , Grace ? " She considered her answer . " Yes , I know what they mean . " She said no more during the rest of the ride and Connie was left to consider the inferences to be taken from Grace 's tone . She wantedto think that Grace did not know what the farmers meant , and she wanted to think that Grace knew only too well what they meant . Connie wondered about the episode until Charlie Jay came home from Ohio . Vacation ended , the girls went back to school , Charlie Jay came home from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Grace gave a dinner party before the Christmas Hop at dancing schoolCharlie was not invited . At her right she put Desmond O'Connell Junior , a pale , curly-haired boy who died practically unnoticed a fewmonths later . A sweet boy , who everyone said went straight to heaven , he meant nothing to Grace , but his father and mother neverforgot that she had been kind to him that last Christmas . It was the only sub-surface knowledge they had of Grace Caldwell , knowledgewhich happened to be in her favor . If they had asked someone close to Grace  --  specifically , Connie Schoffstal  --  they would have learned that the reason Junior O'Connell had been honored by Grace was that he was a harmless , uninteresting boy , who made no demands on a hostess or anyone else , and would do as he was told . But of course Mr. and Mrs. O'Connell did not ask Connie what she thought , and63so they never knew , and so they never had anything but a good wordto say for Grace Caldwell . Grace 's decision not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision before she thought aloud to Connie , was upheldby her father and mother . She was fifteen in 1897 . " Father and I , " said her mother one day in the Spring of thatyear , " have been wondering where to send you to school next year . Flaw you any preferences ? " " Yes , " said Grace . " Miss Holbrook 's . " " No , I meant boarding school . Mrs. Martindale likes Westover . She 's very pleased with Agnes and Jean . " " Maybe Mrs. Martindale is , but I 'm not . " " Do you mean not pleased with Agnes and Jean ? You like JeanMartindale . " " Who said I did ? I 'm sure I never said I liked Jean Martindale , and ' specially since she 's been to Westover . Mon Dieu ! One mightthink Jean Martindale  --  " " I 've spoken to you before about this , Grace . I wo n't have yousaying Mon Dieu . It means my God , and it 's just as sinful in French as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop saying it in English , and now you say it every other word . That 's just the kind of thing a good boarding school puts a stop to . " " I 'm sorry , I 'll try not to say it . " " You 'll have to do better than try . You 'll have to make up yourmind . " " But when I make up my mind , then I 'll have to try , wo n't I ? And I 've made up my mind , so all I can do from now on is try . " " That 's still another thing that has to be corrected . You used to be an obedient , respectful girl , especially where older people were concerned , but lately I 've noticed , I do n't know , you pick people upon what they say . You seem to be losing your manners . " " I should n't call it losing one 's manners to take one 's own part . One has to take one 's part . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting away from the subject . Now then , you have your mind made up against Westover . Well , Father and I 'll consider that , but do n't think if we decide that 's the best place for you , that 's where you 're not going , if you see what I mean . We 'll be the ones to decide . How about St. Timothy 's ? " " Mother ! If you want me to die , in a prison dungeon , put me in the county jail . Alice McKelvie can tell you about St. Timothy 's . " " It 's done Alice a world of good . She was loud and a tomboy and64Mrs . McKelvie was upset about Alice before she went to St. Timothy 's , but she 's outgrown all that and she 's growing up to be a dignified , ladylike girl . " " Mother , I do n't want to be disrespectful or anything , but why do n't you ask the girls what they think of the schools , not their mothers . If you care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimessend their daughters away to get rid of them . Alice McKelvie hates St. Timothy 's , because she told me so herself . " " I 've asked the mothers because they 're in a better position to judge whether the school 's good or not . Another place we thought of was Eden Hall , near Philadelphia . A cousin of ours went there and it 's an excellent school . It 's Catholic , the Sacred Heart runs it , but it 'll help your French , and not Mon Dieu , either . " Grace sighed . " Oh , Mother . I s'pose you 'd like it if I came home and said I was going to the Mass with Julie every Sunday . Julie and Higgins . Get up , Grace , it 's time to go to the early Mass with Julie and Higgins . The Pope will send you to hell if you do n't get up for the Mass . ' " " Now look here , young lady , that 's quite enough of that . " " Help my French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm takingFrench now , and it 's a waste . I 'm never going to live in France . I 'm going to stay right here in Fort Penn , not even in Fort Penn . I 'm going to live on the farm . " " You may fall in love and have a husband , and  --  " " He 'll have to live on the farm or I wo n't marry him . I do n't want to go to any boarding school with a lot of strangers . " " Do you mean to say you 'd like to stay here in Fort Penn the rest of your life ? " " Yes , what 's the matter with Fort Penn ? " " But I should think  --  well , you like boys and eventually you 'll marry . You 're not going to meet many boys here . " " Well , I 'm not going chasing after them in New York and France either . " " No , I would n't want you to do that . " " Well , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to get rid of me . " " Grace , you know that is n't true . " " And anyhow , you do n't meet boys at boarding school . That 's where you 'll never meet them . " Emily Caldwell reported to her husband and they agreed to reopenthe subject the next year . When it was reopened it was done so65more casually , a passing question : did Grace still not want to go to boarding school ? The answer was as they expected . William and Emily Caldwell were happy to have Grace at home with them , and her progress in body and mind made them not want to disturb well- enough . And they were secretly delighted that Fort Penn suited her , that she was not the restless kind that wanted to get away from home . Grace 's decision was the first of many whimsical ideas throughout her life that disproportionately influenced the life of Fort Penn . Girls who wanted to rush off to boarding school the moment they put their hair up were checked by reluctant fathers and mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holbrook 's is good enough for Grace Caldwell . " Likewise girls who did not want to go away re- minded their pushing parents that Grace was staying in Fort Penn . Not the least pleased was Miss Holbrook herself , who had no notion that the original decision had been Grace 's own , but who was wise enough to realize that Grace had had something to say about it improvements at the school which made it approximately as good as she thought it was . This fact , in turn , spread the school 's reputation and Miss Holbrook ( in 1901 ) proudly announced that owing to numerous requests , the school , after due consideration was open to a few , carefully selected boarders . Grace was sixteen , and rapidly overtaking seventeen , on the last night of the Old Century . William Caldwell had been nominated the summer before to be head usher at the Turn of the Century Ball , which was to be held at the Schoffstal House on the thirty-first of December , One Thousand Eight Hundred Ninety-nine , subscription twenty dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how grateful , how honored I am , but I must ask you to withdraw my name . Naturally I expect to be there , to be present that evening , but as a youngster in my twenties , may even have been in my teens , I hoped to live to see that night  --  still am hoping , for that matter . A lot can happen between now and December . Anyway , when I was younger , even before I was married , I made plans to be with my fam ily at the stroke of midnight that night . Well , the good Lord has le me live this far , I have my family , and for just a few minutes at mid night my wife and I are going to slip away from the Ball , go home drink a toast to one another , and to all of you and all of our friends . and then return to the party .

" WilliamCaldwell 's name was thereupon withdrawn and he nominated his good friend Isaac Schoffstal , who was elected head usher . Edgar Martindale , who was not a Fort Penn native but had married a Bordener , whispered to his brother-in-law : " Can you beat it ? Will Caldweil 's family have a tradition that they all get together every new century ! People like you and me are satisfied to get together every Thanksgiving , but not Will Caldwell . Every century , that 's the way traditions run in the Caldwell family . Jesus H. Christ ! " " Now , Edgar , " said Scotty Bordener . " Yes , I know . I 'm being naughty . Furthermore , I understood we were to have the Ball in the 1st Regiment Armory , but just you watch the sentiment change in favor of the Schoffstal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Year 's Eve . The Governor and his staff and all the highbrows in Fort Penn 'll go up in smoke in that fire-trap . " Will and Emily Caldwell slipped away from the Ball and arrived home at eleven-thirty . Grace was there , with Connie , one of the Martindale girls , Winfield Scott Bordener . Frederick William Klein , and Samuel Brock , a cousin of Grace 's from Williamsport , visiting Fort Penn to show there were no hard feelings . The more or less homogeneous young people had sat clown to a big and late dinner at half-past eight . From a little before ten until a little before eleven they had sung all the songs they knew that Grace and Scotty Bordenercould play on the piano , and when the repertoires were exhaustedthey played kissing games . Grace and Fritz Klein had stayed out of the room the longest . Fritz , who was able to report on the way home that Grace Caldwell opened her mouth as soon as you kissed her , was having the time of his life when Connie knocked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mrs. Caldwell 's carriagehad just drawn up out front . " Have you been having a nice time , everybody ? " said Emily Caldwell . " Yes , Mrs. Caldwell . Oh , yes . Fine time . " " Did n't seem to drink much punch , and the cookies , " said Mrs. Caldwell . " Nell , if you 'll all excuse me for just a minute  --  that 's grapejuice , that punch ? Emily ? " said William Caldwell. 67 " Yes , dear . " " Well , I 'll be back in just a moment . " " Arc we going to have champagne , Mud ? " " I do n't really know , but it would n't surprise me . " William Caldwell brought the champagne from the kitchen . " Here we arc , " he said . " I spoke to all your fathers and mothers and you have their permission to toast the new century . Sam , you 're in the family , so I 'll assume the responsibility for you . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Grace . " I wanted to hear it . " " Well , I was thinking  --  might be a splash , get it all over somebody'sdress . But I know . I can give this bottle to Julie and the others out in the kitchen , and we can open another bottle in here . " He took the opened bottle back to the kitchen and returned with the unopened . He removed the cork with a satisfactory pop ! and filled the glasses . " This is a really great occasion , " he said . He continued to talk while filling the glasses . Off with the old , on with the new , but not , uh , not like any other New Year 's any of us have ever seen before , from the oldest to the youngest . A lot of good things , the good things we enjoy , came out of the old century , but think of what we have to look forward to . There 's war in the world , but thank God we 're not in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the history of the Empire . I read that today at the Sentinel office . They have to work Sundays , you know , to get out the Monday paper , tomorrow . Too bad the New Century could n't have started on the first day of the week , is n't it ? But we 're at peace , and what 's more , we 're going to stay that way . Our wheat crop was over a half a billion bushels , and both the Englishand the Boers , the South Africans , both are trying to buy our wheat , and I think President McKinley will probably say , " Now you fellows , you stop this bloodshed or you ca n't have any of our wheat , " and believe me , they need it . I do n't think Bryan can cause any serious trouble in our country . I hope not . And you young people have no idea how much it 's going to mean to the United States , this , uh , new Open Door policy in the Far East . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avarice . And here at home . Think of what they 'll be able to do with electricity . In a few years I do n't think we 'll use gas for anything but cooking , and I must say I 'll welcome that . The X-ray , they 're working on that all the time , so that it wo n't be long before the doctors wo n't have to cut you open to see what 's the matter with you . There we are . " Well , I make it  --  oh , yes , there go the whistles . Five minutes left of good old nineteenth century . Five minutes , the old century tickingaway . Just a few minutes before Nineteen Hundred . Come here , my dear , and hold my hand , the last few minutes of the century that brought us together , and all your fathers and mothers together . Boysand girls , I drink to you , the hope of the 1900 's , and to our friends , your fathers and mothers . " " I have two minutes of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , " said William Caldwell . " Now ! Now it 's less than two . " " I have less than a minute ! " said Samuel Brock . " I think I 'm right , Sam . You 're a little fast . At midnight , the stroke of midnight , they 're going to start ringing the chimes at our church . " " But what if their watches are fast or slow ? " said Grace . " Oh , no , Grace . I 'm sure they 'll be right on the clot , " said William . " There ! " He raised his glass high . " happy New Century to you all . " They all raised their glasses , and before he drank he bent forward and kissed his wife . " My girl , " he whispered . He drank , and then he kissed Grace . " Our daughter Grace , " he said . They all became tearyeyedat this unprecedented exhibition of William Caldwell 's . " Now , I want to kiss you , Connie , the daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martindale . " He shook hands with the boys . " Auld Lang Syne , " he said . " Grace will you officiate for us ? " Grace opened the songbook . " Wait a second , " said William Caldwell . He went out to the kitchen and called in the servants to join in the singing . " Happy NewCentury , Julie . Agnes . Mrs. Higgins . Neal . Hope the team do n't run away in all this noise . " " They 're standing nicely , Sir , " said Higgins . " I 'd a look at them . " " Well , then , " said William Caldwell . " To you all . " " Thank you sir , ma'am , " they said , and raised their glasses . " God bless you . " " About five minutes , Neal , " said William . The servants left . " Could n't we have another bottle of champagne , Father ? " said Grace . " I do n't feel anything . " " I hope you do n't feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Youdo n't take one glass of champagne to feel gay , it 's the ceremony . The occasion , Grace . " " But I 'd like to feel something . I 'm nearly seventeen , after all . " " Emily ? " " Well , all right , " said Emily CaldwellHe opened another bottle and put it in the bucket . " Now we have to go back to our party , " he said . " Good night to you all . " " And , girls , I do n't like to remind you , but one o'clock I promised your mothers , no later . So Grace , your job is to send them home at one . And it 's terribly cold out . I mean that now , Grace . Good night everybody . " " Good night , Mrs. Caldwell , Aunt Emily . Mr. Caldwell , Sir , Uncle Will . " For a few minutes after the Caldwell 's departure no one said anything . " I would n't be surprised if they had the sleighs out again tomorrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything about the New Century , " said Grace . " Oh , I do , " said Betty Bordener . " What ? " said Grace . " I do n't know , but something like a huge gate opening into an enormous valley . " " Piste and tusk , " said Grace . " That 's not the way I feel . The noise and champagne , that 's different , and people all dressed up . But otherwiseit 's just like any other Sunday . " " I never saw your father so  --  romantic , " said Connie . " Neither have I , but once in a hundred years . " She suddenly got up and kissed each of the boys , saying " Happy New Century , " as she did so . She watched the other girls as they imitated her impulse , and when they had done so she said , " Connie , von take Fritz , Betty , you take Sam , and I 'll take Scotty . " " I do n't think we ought to play any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you rather go home ? You 'll have to go soon anyway . " " No , but what if Julie walked in all of a sudden ? " " Somebody ought to be playing the piano , " said Fritz . " No , it 's too late to play the piano , " said Grace . " Maybe I better go home , " said Betty . " Very well , suit yourself about that if you 're afraid , " said Grace " I am not afraid , " said Betty . She took a step and put her arms around Sam and kissed him . " See ? " she said . " Connie , you and Fritz can go in the front room and we 'll go in the library , " said Grace . She turned out the library lights and sat on the sofa and Scotty kissed her , and almost immediately she stretched out and made roomfor him to do likewise . " Do you want to do anything ? " she said . " What ? " " Besides kiss . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand on her breasts and pressed them gently . " Like that , " she said . She kissed him and put her hand at the back of his head and drew him down to her bosom . " I wish I could open it , but I ca n't . " " I can , " he said . " The hooks and eyes ? " " Yes , but you could n't hook them fast enough if anybody came . " " Well , all right . " " Do n't get cross , Scotty . You can do other things . " " This ? " " That , yes , that . Oh , heaven . Oh , heaven , Scotty . Do you like to do that ? " " Love to , love to . " " Do you want me to do something to you ? " " Yes . " " The same thing ? Like this ? " " Oh , Grace ! Grace ! " " Do you want me to stop now ? " she said . " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Grace dear . " " If there 's enough snow on the ground would you like to go for a sleigh-ride tomorrow ? " " Sure . " " I 'll get the cutter . I 'll tell Mother I 'm going to take Connie but I wo n't , I 'll take you . Third and Montgomery at ha ' past three . " " What about Connie ? " " She wo n't mind . She does n't like sleigh-riding anyway . I think you better go in the lavatory and see if your clothes are all right . " " They 're all right . " " T'hen I guess it 's time to go home . " " And then you 'll do what we did , with Sam . " " No I wo n't . " " Did you with Fritz ? " " No . I only kissed him but I did n't like him . " " Why ? " " I did n't ask you what you did with Betty . " " Why did n't you like Fritz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to , what we did , but I would n't let him . Not even my bosom . While he was trying to that was when I wanted you . Remember , I picked you . I did n't pick Fritz again . And I did n't ask Fritz to go sleigh-riding tomorrow . Will you be there ? " " I just hope you do n't do this with every fellow . " " ' that 's a nice thing to say to a person that likes you . You neverheard of me even kissing a boy before . Did you ? " " No . But that 's what makes it hard to understand . " " It just happened to me . " " Somebody else must have . Did they ? Who ? I 'm not the firstthat ever did anything to you , you ca n't tell me that . " " Just because I know what happened to you ? I 've seen it happen to stallions . People are almost the same . " " I 'll bet Charlie Jay did . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was almosteighteen . " " Ile has a bad reputation . " " Then he deserves it . He thinks he 's such a beautiful dancer butI wo n't ask him to my ball unless I have to . I do n't care if I never saw him again in all my whole life . It must be one o'clock , Scotty . Will you be there tomorrow ? Third and Montgomery ? " " All right . " " Kiss me again , Scotty . " " All right . " They joined Connie and Fritz , who were sitting in the bay window , with the window slightly raised while they shared a cigarette . Betty was sitting on Sam 's lap in a hall chair . Grace and Scotty were the ones with the most convincingly innocent look. 3Sidney and Grace , as has been noted , had been acquainted two and a half years before they became man and wife . In their later life together they often were given the opportunity to assert that they al-72most did n't get together at all . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Could n't stand me , dear ? Why , she did n't even know I was alive . " " Oh , I knew you were alive , " she would say . " But I thought you thought me just a babe in arms , and I pretended I did n't know you were alive . " " When it came to pretending she was a corker , " Sidney would say . " I beg your pardon , dear . One word Grace always objects to is corker . " " I do n't know why , either , but I do . " " You must admit I hardly ever use the word any more . " This conversation , first spoken within six months of their marriage , was repeated at least annually all their life together  --  including the animadversion and contrition upon Sidney 's use of the word corker . Grace and Sidney followed not one but two of the standard plots which end at the altar . They almost never saw each other again after their first meeting , which is part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not meet at all , which is part of another standard arrangement . And as in all altar-bound plots , not excluding the one wherein the two principals grew up together from babyhood , the hand of fate could be seen , especially when attention was called to it as Grace and Sidney would do when it came their turn to tell how they happened to get together . It is impossible to say where the hand of Fate began to intervene in any getting together of man and woman , but Sidney and Grace were in agreement that in their case it most likely was the day Sidney and Brock Caldwell arrived at Lawrenceville . That was as far back as Sidney and Grace cared to go . Sidney already had been at Lawrencevillefor two years and was able to identify Brock as a new boy . Hazingwas not a practice that came easily to Sidney , and the Form below his had been treated more kindly by Sidney than the Form above had treated him . However , he invoked the droit de seigneur , so to speak , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valise while he , Sidney , an old boy , was lugging two . " Say , you with the straw hat , give us a hand here . " " Go to hell , " said Brock . " Oh , is that so ? Who are you , you unspeakable pisspot ? What 's your name and who do you think you 're looking at in that tone of voice ? " 73 " My name , if it 's any your business , is Brock Caldwell , from Fort Penn , P-A , and you 're the piss in the pisspot . Do you wan na fight ? " They fought , and though the actual fighting was ended in less than ten minutes , with Sidney unmistakably the winner , for two years at Lawrenceville Brock went out of his way to avoid speaking to Sidney . Sidney , who was the singles champion of the school , captain and shortstop of his House team , and a high-stand boy in his Form , joined with the rest of the school in giving Caldwell up as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brock to Princeton , and they had no further encounter until Christmas 1900 . Sidney had had a series of conversations with his father in the summer of that year , following his graduation from Yale . The final colloquy was as follows : " Well , Father , I 've turned it all over again in my mind . " " It ' being your future plans . " " Yes , sir . " " And ? " " Well , first let me say , I did what you told me to do the last time we talked . I looked at it in the light of being fair to you , fair to Mama , and fair to myself . " " Please go on . I see you 've prepared a stump-speech , or whatever you wish to call it , but go on , I 'm game . " The father and the son laughed . " Yes , I did do a little work on this , " said Sidney . " Without any false modesty , I 'll put fairness to myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I were n't fair to myself , how could I be honestly fair to you and Mama . " " I did n't say quite that , dear boy . I never ' ve said anything like honestly fair . ' Fair implies honestly . Go on . " " You 're right . As usual . But , uh , well  --  I do n't like business and I do n't consider that I 'm cut out to be a business man . Therefore , since that 's my honest , well-considered opinion , I could n't do an honest , that is to say fair job in business . I 've done as you suggested . Looked about in other businesses and of course at New Haven I had ample opportunity to consider the various professions , and in this country of course we do n't classify what a gentleman can do , such as Holy Orders , the Law , or Politics , the Army . Nobody 'd ever think of making the Army a career unless he happened to be born into it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not , " said Sidney . " No , the more I looked about , the more I was convinced of one thing about myself and my future , and74that was , that I could n't live cooped up in an office . Business office , doctor 's office , lawyer 's office or any other job that largely kept me indoors . . . Now please do n't say anything quite yet , Father . I know what you 're thinking , and I 've anticipated you . Perhaps you were goingto say engineering . Well , it 's true I know some fellows that are going in for engineering careers , building dams and blasting mountainsand digging canals . Out of doors . Adventure . But there again , I like excitement , but the life of adventure does n't appeal to me . At the proper time , the proper girl , I 'd like to settle down and raise a family , have my own home , and so forth and so on . Just as you have . And  --  note the emphasis on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy a farm . " The older man examined the long ash of his cigar . " I rather thought you 'd come to that . It is n't so strange , you know . You 're not far removed from the land . Your mother 's father was a farmer and a prosperous one , and on our side of the family , why dear me , we 've got sod on our boots down to this minute . My , yes . Textiles connote life in the country , if that 's the word I mean . Connote . Yes , I 'm sure it 's a suitable word . And so what do you purpose doing next ? " " I 'm going to start looking at farms , investigating . I have in mind some fellows that 'd put me on to a good farm if they knew about one . Fellows I knew at New Haven . " " Yes . Of course you understand that a good farm is usually kept in the family , that 's the reason it 's a good farm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his farm if he can possibly avoid it . Your grandfather , Mr. Harmon , had no sons to come after him . That 's why he sold . " " I 've thought about that . " " And I hope my son , regardless of his reluctance to fit himself into the business world , I 'm sure a son of mine  --  errrr-uh-hhhwell , you 've heard of the warning , Caveat emptor . ' " " Yes . But this may please you , Father . I do n't plan to buy a big moneymaker , well established . I know you 'll be generous , but I 'm rather counting on finding a farm that is n't too successful , and therefore is n't too expensive , but has possibilities that I can de-velop . " " So far , so good . You have my blessing , and I have every confidence in you . " " Thank you , Father . " " Take as long as you like , and when you 've found what you want we 'll have another talk . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hilly can be bought more cheaply than flat lands , but withouthaving been a farmer , it seems to me man and beast have enough to put up with without borrowing more trouble on land that 's up and down , up and down . And my guess is hilly land is liable to be rocky land , and there 's no profit in rocks . " " I Iave you ever wanted to be a farmer , Father ? " The older man chuckled . " Ho-ho ! Me a farmer ? . . . Yes , myson . All my life . " One of the fellows Sidney had in mind as likely to put him on to a good farm was Paul Reichelderfer , who lived in Lebanon , a town about twenty miles east of Fort Penn . Paul had been in Sidney 's class at Yale . He was an amiable fat boy with a remarkable capacity for beer . Ile was so big that he had to go to a tailor for his clothes , but he did more than go to a tailor ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , he had to have money to eat , but he had more than enough for that ; he was rich . Buried in the fat face was a thin handsome face , with a neat , rather sharp nose and small , alert blue eyes . He ate big , drank big , smoked big , and his frolics with women were prodigious , but at Yale he had not exceeded his capacity foi activities of the table and the bed , and he was a social success . He was Phi Beta Kappa and Kappa Beta Phi , and the Phi Beta Kappa key confused strangers who belonged to Kappa Beta Phi as much as the Kappa Beta Phi key annoyed Phi Betes . In a gathering that was likely to be predominantly scholarly he would wear the drinking club 's key , and he would wear the other key in a group of high-life men , and after enjoying their furtive examinations of the key he was wearing he would display the second . This was good for a laugh , and the loudest laugh always was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Head , the Yale senior society to which Sidney belonged . As part of his initiation into Death 's Head a neophyte was required under oath to reveal any and all facts concerning his L. H. , or Life History , and C. B. , or ConnubialBliss . The life history part was not so embarrassing as details of connubial bliss . " C. B. " was so called because in spite of the fact that most of the members of Death 's I-Iead were bachelors , now and then it would turn out that a neophyte was secretly married and it became necessary to hold a ceremony in which his wife was made a Death 's Head wife . But married or not , the neophyte was compelled to tell the members of the society all they wanted to hear about his relations with women , and more than once it had happenedthat a man had had to admit to maximum intimacies with a girl whose brother or fiance was present . The theory was that one Death 's I-Icaci man could have no secret from another , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One Death 's Head man was supposed to be able to rise above the fact that the girl he was going to marry had been sleeping with another Death 's Head man . Sidney Tate and Paul Reichelderfer had had to make no awkward confessions regarding sisters or fiancee . Sidney had neither sister nor fiancee at the time , and Paul 's three sisters were older than he and inclined to be as corpulent . Sidney thus had no hesitation about writing to his friend for the kind of farm information he sought . Paul was delighted to hear from his brother in Death 's Head . " You have come to the right man , " he wrote Sidney . " I do n't recall your ever asking me what business my father was in . I-Iad you asked me , you would not now be hesitant concerning my knowledge of farm prices in this vicinity . My father is an attorney-at-law in the firm of Reichelderfer &; Reichelderfer ( my father is the one on the right , i.e. , senior partner ) . He is also principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he makes it his business to be conversant with the values of farms in the county . He can tell you at the drop of a hat how much any farm is worth . If he does not hold the mortgage , he knows who does . He also makes it his business to have a speaking acquaintance with the individual farmers . He is the man to see . . . I suggest you visit us . Kill two birds with one stone . If you would honor us with your august presence during Christmas holidays you will be able to talk more to the farmers individually , as their work is done until Spring . They have more time on their hands . Also we can take in the dances , etc . Reading is closer , but Fort Penn is larger . The latter has prettier girls on all social strata . " Sidney considered the invitation and accepted it . A town in Pennsylvania offered a different kind of Christmas holiday from the New York kind . He told Paul Reichelderfer that he would arrive in Lebanon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its principal purpose . Sidney learned the truth of his father 's warning that a good farm usually stayed in the family . Paul 's father drove him out to look at a few farms that would be on the market in five or ten years , when the owners could be expected to retire or die , but he too warned Sidney that he could not recommend purchase of any farm then up for sale . Theland is sour , " said Mr. Reichelderfer , pronouncing it sahr . " You would lose too much making it good land . Sit still is best , young fellow , a year yet , two years yet , five years yet . One of those days I write you a letter , Dear Sidney , come quick , I have your farm foryou . ' " The secondary purpose of the visit was fulfilled . Paul Reichelderferwas a host in any group or at anybody 's party , and Sidney was made to feel that he was the visitor Pennsylvania had been discoveredfor . On the fifth of the six nights Sidney was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Paul booked the dining-roomof a farmers ' hotel about ten miles north of Lebanon . Sixty young men and their ladies were invited . Some came in hay-wagons from which the wheels had been removed and four runners substituted . Some came in cutters , and sleighs with room for six . The men had a drink or two  --  no more  --  of straight rye whiskey while the ladies were getting their furs off . At dinner wine and beer were served , but this was an eating , not a drinking occasion . They began with oysters on the half shell , followed by thick chicken noodle soup , stewed chicken , mashed potatoes , candied sweet potatoes , string beans , lima beans , pickled beets , creamed carrots , squash , endive salad , apple pie , cream pie , shoofly pie , hot or cold mince pie , rhubarb pie , cocoanut cake , chocolate cake with vanilla icing , and angel food with chocolate icing . Also on the table were seven sweet and seven sour relishes , somersausage , bologna , liverwurst , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kisses . The waffles were served with the chicken and it was not considered good form for a man to eat fewer than ten waffles , with chicken gravy or maple syrup . Sidney ate fourteen waffles , and Paul ate twenty . The ladies averaged five waffles . The party sat down at eight-thirty and got up from the table at eleven-fifteen . The ladies retired to the upper story and the men went to the bar for cigars and peach or cherry brandy . The men who were going to drive home took coffee ; the others declined . Paul delighted the gentlemen with the longest and loudest breaking of wind , more or less a local tradition , and when the ladies rejoined the gentlemen in the dining-room , which had been cleared , the party listened to the piano , violin , and cello , and conversedpolitely , chiefly about what they had just eaten , until one young lady looked at her little watch on its fleur-de-lis pin and exclaimed , " Heavens ! Ten to twelve ! Mother 'll lock me out , and then what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  not the gentleman who had escorted her to the party  --  would have to marry her . On this7ghigh and risque note the young people started for their conveyances and the cool , snuggly ride under the buffalo robes . The other nights of Sidney 's visit had been arranged for . The first night he dined with the Reichelderfer family ( " We 'll take care of that first , " Paul had said ) . The second night he attended the Masonic Ball . The afternoon of the third day Paul and Sidney took a train to Reading and changed there for Gibbsville , a town to the north of Reading , where they put up at the Gibbsville Club and went to the Gibbsville Club ball . They slept until noon the next day , and having declined invitations of several Yale friends to stay on , they returned to Reading . " We got to have one stag night in Reading . They 're not expecting us home till tomorrow . " They had dinner at a rathskeller and went to the burlesque show , drank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a whore-house on South Fifth Street . " You ought to get your wick dipped once while you 're here , Sidney , and the place I 'm taking you to  --  safe as a nunnery . Only the biggest business men , professional men , no small change goes to this place . But anything you want . You want to be frenched . Two at a time . A little dark meat . I come here regularly so I know them , but they always have new talent too . This is as good as any place in New York or Philadelphia . First person ever took me here was my uncle , my freshman year . " " Do we spend the night ? " " Can , but I would n't like to be seen leaving here in the daylight . As a rule I get in about this time of the night and either I leave before morning or stay till the next night . Tomorrow night we 're supposed to go to a hop at the Wiedemyers ' so maybe we ought to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three nights at a stretch , but that was last summer when the parents wereaway . " For the fourth time in his life Sidney hired a woman . She was young and pretty , the first girl brought in to him for inspection . They had a large room containing an outsize double bed with a canopy , a gas-lit crystal chandelier , gilt chairs and marble-topped table , and mirrors in the wardrobe and hall doors . They had champagne and cigarettes while she told her story , which he believed : her father was a coal miner , who beat her , and her mother sold her to the boarders . She ran away when she was fifteen , she was now eighteen . She stood up and unhooked her evening gown and then drew it shut again , watching to see the effect on him . She hung up his clothes in the wardrobe and lowered the gaslight burners and suddenly79dropped her gown and stood straight , with her legs close together , and hardly breathing until he spoke to her . " Come here , Sonya , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next time will be better , " shesaid . " There is n't going to be any next time , " he said . " Oh , do n't say that . " " You 'll get your money . " " I know , but I 'm not thinking of money . Paul is paying , and Iget the same if you have me once or all night . No , the next time weboth enjoy it . " " No , let 's have some champagne , " he said . " Your mouth is dry ? All right . But not too much to drink . Don'tgo to sleep , do n't get too drunk . " " Sonya , I 'm through for the night . " " You want to bet me ? I 'll bet you a kiss . " " No betting . " " No , no betting . It 's foolish to bet on things like that . But youwill want me in a little while , Sidney , because I like you . Unless you put me out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll let me stay here ? " " Sure . " " And talk to me ? " " Why not ? " " I 'll get you a glass of champagne . Do you wish a cigarette ? " " Please , " he said . She pulled a sheet off the bed and wrapped herself in it . Shepoured champagne into two glasses and lit two cigarettes and put them in her mouth and carried the champagne to his side of the bed , holding her elbows close to her body so that the sheet would notfall . " The only drink I like , champagne , " she said . " You have expensive tastes . " " Oh , yes . That 's why I 'm here . I-Iere I will meet some elderlyman or in his forties or like that , and what he will say , he will say , Sonya , I am taking you out of here and put you up in your own house , here , Philadelphia , New York City . Somewhere . ' And he will do it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not worn out . And because he likes me to beat him with a whip . " " You mean there is such a man ? " 8o " Hundreds , thousands . You do n't believe this . Sometimes in this place I have gone a whole week without  --  a young fellow . Youngand strong , like you . I would go to bed with you for nothing . For pleasure . " " Really ? " " When I get this old man you can come to see me . I 'll tell Paul where I am . Are you married ? " " No . " " I know you are n't in love with anybody , so you can come andsee me and I wo n't charge you , because the old man will be giving me money . " " Well , thank you , Sonya . " " Maybe sooner than you think , too . I 'll let Paul know where I am , see ? And you can come all the time till you fall in love with a rich girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get another young man . With what you got , Sidney . Sweetheart . Honey . " It was daylight when Sidney and Paul reached the street again , better friends at least for the time being than the mumbo-jumbo of Death 's Head had made them . They returned to Lebanon on anafternoon train and resumed their places in the polite society of Eastern Pennsylvania . All week Paul had been telling Sidney that the sixth night of his visit to Pennsylvania would be the climax of the seasonal gaiety . Sidney had been given to understand that the Fort Penn affair was the big affair . The Gibbsville people had told him he was a fool not to stay over for their Assembly , and the Reading people swore by the Reading Assembly , but Sidney had noticed that in Gibbsville and in Reading the supporters of local festivity offered little resistance when he said he was booked up for the Fort Penn Assembly . In Gibbsville they said , " You 're not going to give us the go-by in favor of Reading , are you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to the Gibbsville Assembly . " They had nothing to say against FortPenn , but they most certainly had nothing to say in favor of it . He looked forward to Fort Penn . At the last minute he almost did not go . " Our invitations finally came , " said Paul . " I 'm on their list , but when I wrote in and askedfor a card for my guest they wanted to know all about who you were and what et cetera . " " What did you tell them ? " " I told them you were a high muckamuck in New York society , and I guess probably they wondered what the devil you were doing 81visiting me in Lebanon . But I told them you were here on business , in case they were wondering , and I mentioned a couple of the fellows at New Haven that live in Fort Penn . " " Who ? Do I know them ? " " Oh , sure . Les Poffenberger . Joe Cunningham . Jack Stephens . Emlen Dcatrick . George Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , I know them all . I did n't realize they were all from FortPenn . " " Uh-huh . Radcliff Dickinson too , but I did n't mention hisname . " " Glad you did n't . Was he from Fort Penn ? " " He 's from Fort Penn all right . They know about him there , too . La de da . But anyway , everything 's fine and dandy . I got thecards today from Brock Caldwell . " " Who did you say ? " " Brock Caldwell . Do you know him , Sidney ? " " It must be the same chap . Did he go to Lawrenceville ? " " Yes he did . " " It 's the same fellow . No wonder there was a delay . Mr. Caldwell and I do n't see eye to eye . On anything . I gave him a thrashing the first day he arrived at Lawrenceville and he never forgave me . We never spoke again , for two years . And I have n't seen himsince . " " Holy smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're going to see a lot of him the next twenty-four hours . We 're spending thenight at his house . " " Oh , we could n't do that , Paul . The trip 's off , as far as I 'm concerned , " said Sidney . " But you go , of course . " Paul 's face had become all fat , none of the sharpness was there . He seemed about to puff or pout . Then suddenly he was alive again . " No , by George . Brock 's supposed to be a gentleman , and he wrotethis note . Here , take a look . " Dear Paul  --  I trust you will pardon the delay in sending the enclosedcards . I was responsible for the delay , owing to my being out of town when the Committee forwarded your application for a guest card . I believe I attended Lawrenceville with Mr. Tate . You will both be our guests overnight as it is impossible to secure suitable hotel accommodations . My mother said she will be delighted to have you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please let me know by Postal Telegraph whether you can stay with us , but I assure you that you and your guest are82more than welcome . Thanking you in advance for your overlookingthe delay , I remain , Sincerely yours , Brock Caldwell " Well , I 'll be damned , " said Sidney . " Why ? " " Well , you do n't realize . He was an insufferable horse-cock at school . I told him so . ' You 're a horse-cock yourself , ' he said , and away we went . He was game , but I was in training and I suppose he was n't . For two years we never spoke . And then , out of the blue sky comes this . I 'd say he came off very well . I did n't consider him such-a-much , but you never know from where you sit where the man in the gallery'sgoing to spit . " " He 's probably changed an awful lot since you knew him . I know him to say hello to . My father knows his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fort Penn creme de la creme . I do n't know whether they 're the wealthiest , but when it comes to exclusive and all that  --  one family . The Caldwells . The Schoffstals they generally consider the wealthiest , but the Schoffstals ape the Caldwells in every way , shape , and form . They say the Schoffstals wo n't take a leak unless they get permission from the Caldwells . " " Come to think of it , I called him a piss-pot , not a horse-cock . But all this puts another light on the situation , Paul . You see what he 's doing ? Apparently he 's the crown prince , heir apparent , in Fort Penn .. Splendid opportunity to put me in my place . Have you sent the telegraphmessage ? " " yes. , " Good . I 'd like to see how Mr. Brock Caldwell handles the situation , meaning me . " " They 'll treat you like a prince . They 're fine people , " said Paul " Mr. and Mrs. Caldwell are the genuine article , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored man was carrying their valises down the steps of the Nesquehela , Fort Penn &; Lebanon depot when they saw Brock , who was getting out of a sleigh . Brock directed the colored man and hurried to Paul and Sidney . " Our railroad 's getting punctual for a change , " said Brock . " How are you , Paul ? How are you , Tate ? I have n't seen you in years . Very glad you could come . Did you know each other at Yale ? I guess that 's a question with an obvious answer . " " You 're very kind , Caldwell , putting us up and so forth and so on . " 83 . " A pleasure to do so , Tate . I have a sleigh here . I 'll sit up front with our man , and point out the places of interest , ha ha . Not many , are there , Paul ? I take it this is your first visit to Fort Penn , Tate . " " First time in Pennsylvania , outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great future , but I just hope it is n't going to be another Pittsburgh . Now then , you two in the back . Paul takes up a little room . Boy , put two of the valises in the back and we can accommodate two up here , ca n't we Neal ? This looks as though you fellows were going to stay a while . " " No , three of the valises belong to Sidney . He 's going bacll to New York from here , tomorrow . How 're Mr. and Mrs. Caldwell ? " " Both in excellent health , thanks . " " And your sister ? " " Grace ? Growing up too fast , if you ask me . Sixteen , and dis appointed she was n't allowed to go to the ball tonight . Sixteen , mind you . Next Christmas she 's going to have her own shindig and I 'm against it , but Mother and Father weakened . She 'll be eighteen a few months after next Christmas , and she 's persuaded them . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid . A kid . " The three young men had separate rooms and shared Brock 's bathroom . They freshened up and by the time they went downstairs to meet Mrs. Caldwell a maid was drawing the shades on the library windows . " It gets dark so quickly , " said Mrs. Caldwell . " When Brock left for the station it was still daylight . Gloomy day , but it was n't dark . " " Fire feels good , Mrs. Caldwell . " " Yes , I like a fire . I suppose it 's the older you get , but I light a fire sometimes in July , at the farm . Any excuse . Dampness . A cool turn in the weather . I 'm very fond of a nice fire in the fireplace . " " So am I , " said Paul . " I 'd rather have it in the fireplace than in the bookshelf , " said Brock . " Oh , Brock , now you stop treating your mother like an idiot , " said Mrs. Caldwell . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , I 'm afraid to look at you , Mr. Tate . Paul 's an old friend but Brock 's been accusing me of wanting to flirt with you , all day , before you got here . Flirting , at my age ! Or any age ! " " I hope you do flirt a little , Mrs. Caldwell . I 'll flirt right back . " " Oh , now . And poor Grace . I 'll be surprised if she shows her face in this room or at meals or anything , Brock 's been teasing her so . If she dares look at you Brock 's bound to accuse her of flirting. 84 " Nonsense , " said Brock . " Would you like to smoke a cigarette , Tate ? Paul ? I have Richmond Straight Cuts , if you like them . " " It 's all right , " said Mrs. Caldwell . " I like the smell of cigarettes and cigars . I like pipes too , while they 're going , but ugh . Lying on a table or mantel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine in my valise , " said Sidney . " By the way , your dress suits are being pressed . Paul , I told the maid to lay yours out on the bed where there 'd be more room , but yours 'll be hanging in the wardrobe , Tate . " " Oh , now , Brock , Paul is n't as big as all that and I think it 's rude to tease a guest , and I wish you would n't call Mr. Tate by his last name . If he is n't Sidney , he 's Mister Tate . While he 's with us I 'm going to call him Sidney . " " I thank you , and I feel welcome , Mrs. Caldwell , " said Sidney . " Now that 's a graceful speech . Sidney , " she said . " We 're going to have tea and sandwiches in a few minutes when Mr. Caldwell gets home , because you 're dining quite late . Unless you 'd rather have something now , Sidney ? Paul ? " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can always raise havoc with food , but I think I can stave off the pangs of hunger till Mr. Caldwell gets here . " They heard the front door and vestibule door close . " There , " said Mrs. Caldwell . " There he is now . You see you get your reward for being polite . . . Oh , no . It is n't Mr. Caldwell . Come in , Grace . " " I 'll be right down , " said Grace , from the hall . She did not look in and they saw her only briefly , darting past the library door . " She 'll be right down , " said Mrs. Caldwell . " Ring for Ella , Brock , please . We 'll reward Paul and Sidney anyway . " Tea was served , and water-cress sandwiches and little cakes . The three young men had had second cups of tea and had lighted cigarettesbefore Grace Caldwell made her first proper appearance . She did not curtsey when she was introduced . She knew Paul slightly . She stood behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit down , dear ? " said her mother . " I 'm comfortable standing . " The young men sat down . The chairs and the people in them were grouped in the center of the library , a room that nearly always needed artificial light from lamps or fireplace . As Grace stood behind her mother 's chair she was out of the light of the single lamp and the blazing fire , but what85Sidney saw he admired . Her skin was healthy and clear . Without previous information it would have been difficult to guess her age accurately ; the length of her dress was a length that was being worn by girls in their twenties . Her bosom and hips were as mature as Sonya 's , whom he suddenly thought of and as suddenly tried to banish from his mind . He watched her while the conversation went on . She hardly looked at anyone ; she gazed into the fire . She would breathe regularlythrough her nose , then every few minutes she would part her lips and moisten them with the tip of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act bored , and being helped along in her act by the fact that the same reticence which in an older , sophisticated girl meant boredom , could also mean , in a girl of sixteen , no more than good upbringing ; respect for her elders , not speaking until spoken to . But Sidney knew that she wanted him to think she was bored . " I 'm sorry Miss Caldwell is n't going to be with us this evening , " he said . He was indeed sorry , but he felt certain the remark would deflate her . " Well , time enough for Grace next year , " said her mother . " Time enough the year after next , if you ask me , " said Brock . " Did anyone ask you ? " said Grace . " Children  --  " " Children ? " said Brock . " Now really , Mother . " " Children if you behave like children . When you tease Grace , especially in front of company , you put yourself on the same basis as Grace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rats , " said Brock . " Have you any brothers or sisters , Sidney ? " " No , ma'am , I 'm the only child . " " Lucky you , " said Brock . " Well , I do n't know , uh , Brock . I often wish I 'd had a brother or a sister . " " A younger sister 'd be all right I guess , " said Paul . " Oh , now , Paul , " said Mrs. Caldwell . " You 're spoiled . I happen to know , your nice sisters spoil you . " Paul laughed . " No , ma'am , I never noticed it . " " Oh , now , you know they do , " said Mrs. Caldwell . The conversation was getting away from Sidney 's intent , which was to talk across the others to Grace . He lost interest , and so did she . She frowned at the fire and said no more until her father came in . The tea things had been removed before he arrived ; apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was jovial and affectionate , kissedhis wife and daughter ; but after acknowledging the introductions he looked at his hunting-case watch long enough to have read all the numerals and then looked at his wife . " Yes , dear , " she said . " I 'm very sorry , Paul , Mr. Tate , but Mrs. Caldwell and I have to be changing . In fact , if we left now , as we are , we 'd be no more than punctual . As it is  --  you 'll excuse us , Mr. Tate ? Paul ? And of course we 'll see you at lunch tomorrow . I 'd ask you to have lunch with me at the Fort Penn Club , but they do n't serve breakfast after nine-thirty , and , uh , well , this past week I expect we 've served breakfast here , at the Caldwell Club , as late as four o'clock in the afternoon , is n't that so , Brock ? " " One afternoon it was half past five , if anybody does n't get the point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other day . " " Well , gentlemen , you 're invited to lunch with me , but only if  --  no , that 's foolish . I withdraw my invitation . If you felt like getting up in time for lunch that could only mean you 'd had an uninteresting time at your party . Hope I 'll see you all tomorrow afternoon . " " Not me , I 'm afraid , sir , " said Sidney . " I 'm taking an afternoon train back to New York . " " Oh , no . Why  --  in and out like that ? Not giving us a chance to see something of you ? Well , now , that 's a pity . Brock , you see if you ca n't persuade your old schoolmate to  --  Grace , you try . " " I think you 're very kind to have me at all , sir . You and Mrs. Caldwell . And Brock . " " Well , I 'll have to leave it up to my son and daughter , because my wife and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . Good night . " Mr. and Mrs. Caldwell left and Grace said , " I 'll say good night , too . Good night , Paul . Good night , Mr. Tate . Good night , Brother dear . " Back in New York the next night Sidney removed the gloves from the tail-pocket of his dress suit and the white tasseled dance programmefrom his waistcoat pocket . He examined the gloves and decidedthey needed to be cleaned ; he examined the programme , and tossed it in his waste-basket . None of the names meant anything to him , not even Caldwell , since it signified only the easily forgettable young lady whom Brock Caldwell had escorted to the ball . He wrote and rewrote his bread-and-butter letter to Paul 's mother and another thank-you letter to Paul 's father and another to Paul . He wanted to be sure that he left a good impression because throughthem he might be able to see the Caldwells again . He was even more careful with his letter to Mrs. Caldwell : Dear Mrs. Caldwell : Despite my groping for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you how much I appreciate your kindness to me , the stranger whom you took into your home for the ( to me ) all too brief tenureof my visit . Suffice it to say I look back upon my stay at your home as the high point of my visit to Fort Penn and thanks to the warmth of your hospitality I hope I may count myself on your approved list of friends should you contemplate a visit to New York in , let us hope , the near future . Very sincerely yours , He had stopped at a florist 's on the way to the train in Fort Penn and sent a basket of whatever the florist selected for Mrs. Caldwell , five dollars ' worth , but he wanted the letter to be eloquent , and he was rather proud of it . The whole point of it was to suggest with emphasis that he would like to be on the list when the Caldwells were issuing invitations to Grace 's ball , and he considered he had done that rather well . He also had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which were unmistakably engravedS . T.His bread-and-butter letter was opened at breakfast , in the presence of the addressee , her husband , her son , and her daughter . MRS . CALDWELL : " A charming note from Sidney . Sidney Tate . " WILLIAM CALDWELL : " Is that so ? Read it . " BROCK CALDWELL : " I could tell you what 's in it without even readingit . He enjoyed Fort Penn , but most of all he enjoyed staying here with the charming Caldwell family . " MRS . CALDWELL : " IIe does say it was the high point of his visit . " BROCK : " Naturally , naturally . Lord knows he was rude enough at the ball . " EMILY CALDWELL : " Rude , Brock ? How rude ? I do n't think it 's in him to be rude . " WILLIAM CALDWELL : " I do n't either . I did n't see much of him , but he impressed me as a young man of impeccable manners , im-peccable . " BROCK : " Oh , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS .

There 's a way of doing all the proper things that 's just as bad as if you picked your teeth with the oyster fork . Haughty . He made no effort to be cordial or considerate . He bored the deuce out of all the girls . Made no effort at conversation . He was a New York boor , that 's what he was . Trying to put on the dog for the benefit of the country yokels .

" GRACE : " If he bored the girls at the ball , maybe they bored him . " WILLIAM CALDWELL : " A very good answer . " MRS . CALDWELL : " Yes , it is . " BROCK : " What you 'd expect from Grace . Grace , next year 's femmefatale . Oh , Grace 's going to show Fort Penn , all right all right . " GRACE : " I think you 're just jealous because I 'm having a ball andboys ca n't have balls .

I think he was a climber at Lawrenceville , sticking his nose into everything , busy as a bee all over the place . And may I ask who brought him here ? We all know Paul Reichelderfer 's father and mother can hardly speak English and I could tell you things about Paul that would n't make him welcome in this house . And may I ask , if he 's anybody  --  I mean Tate  --  why would he want to spend Christmas in Lebanon ? If you ask me , he was n't invited anywhere in New York . I 'm very suspicious of New York people that show up here at Christmas-time , and Lebanon ! " 891'IMRS . CALDWELL : " He wants to buy a farm . Paul told me .

" BROCK : " What did you expect them to do ? Dear old Yale boys . " WILLIAM CALDWELL : " Yes , and they all finished Yale , too . " Breakfast adjourned at that point , without Mrs. Caldwell 's havingread Sidney 's letter to her family . Later in the day , however , Grace reminded her mother of that fact . " I 'd like to read Mr. Tate 's letter , " said Grace . " Very well . It 's on my desk . " Emily Caldwell did not look upfrom her sewing . " He has a nice handwriting , " said Grace . " Yes , I thought so too . Strong , I 'd say . I do n't know whether thatmeans anything , but sometimes I s'pose it does . " " I did n't like him very much . " " Did n't you , Grace ? Why ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did you talk to him aboutbuying a farm ? " " No . Paul told me . " " He did n't look like anybody that 'd want to own a farm . " " Why ? You only saw him in city clothes .

" " No , but that 's the first time you ever told me in so many words Iwas pretty , " said Grace . " The next letter from Sidney I wo n't mention at the breakfasttable . " " The next letter ? " " Naturally he 'll write again to thank us for sending him his hairbrushes . He forgot his hair brushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't forget them . . . Have you done any more about your invitationlist for next year ? " 90 " Why ? " " We could easily find out Sidney 's address , just by looking at his stationery . How convenient ! " " Oh , Mother , you 're teasing me . " " Well , I 'll copy it down and put it in my hook so we 'll have it . " " But I said I did n't like him . " " All right , if you feel the same way next Christmas we wo n't invite him . " At her mother 's direction Grace wrote a note to Sidney : Dear Mr. Tate : Mother has asked me to tell you that we found your hair brushes in the room you occupied . We have packed them and they have been sent to you by Adams Express . They should reach you in a few days . If not , please notify us and a " tracer " will be put on them as they are insured . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will try to duplicate then at the local jewelry store and send the new brushes to you . With best wishes from Mother and myself , I remain , Yours sincerely , Grace CaldwellThe next item in this correspondence was dated January 31 , 1901 , and was written on the stationery of Almond 's Hotel , Clifford Street , London . Dear Mrs. Caldwell : I have just received a letter from my Mother in which she mentioned that a parcel containing my hair brushes had been forwardedby Adams Express . Please forgive me the delay in answeringbut as you see I am in England and Mother 's letter only just reached me . I must apologize for my forgetfulness and the inconvenience it must have caused you ; but I confess that I was also secretly delighted to have a note from the charming Miss Grace Caldwell , in which she , as your amanuensis , told me of your thoughtfulness in forwarding the hair brushes . Selfishly , I am delighted that while the hair brushes may have been a nuisance to you , they afford me the opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England for slightly over two weeks . My trip was a sudden one . I do n't think I told you that I am English on my father 's side . In fact , he has never become an American citizen , although I , of course , am a citizen by birth . My mother , I hasten to add , is American to the core , having descended from a long line of91New York and " York State " people . My father invariably replies , when asked why he has not become an American citizen , " Who could be more American than I ? " But he will not give in on the subject of citizenship . It has always been in the back of his mind to have me go to Oxford . Therefore , when I finished at Yale he dropped hints here and there about my going to Oxford , but I was interested in farming ( the reason I visited Paul Reichelderfer was to look at some Pennsylvania properties , and thus I became acquainted with the delightful Caldwell family ) . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I returned to New York and acceded to my father 's suggestion that I might at least have a look at Oxford . I therefore have been " havinga look , " but I very much fear that I am too American for that institution , or , perhaps , to be truthful , smugly satisfied with the amount of education I have had . At any rate , I do not intend to matriculate at Oxford . On the contrary , after a visit to cousins whom I am seeing for the first time , I intend to visit France and Italy , after which I shall return home in order to resume my quest for a farm . I expect to be home shortly before Easter , whenever that is this year ; and at this time I should like to repeat my invitation to you and any and all members of your family to stop with us when next you visit New York . Our house is too Iarge for so small a family , and there is more than ample room for our guests . You would be free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again for your kindnesses in the past , I beg to re-main , Yours sincerely , Sidney Tate . In her wisdom Emily Caldwell deemed it inexpedient to encouragefurther correspondence at that time . She saw , or thought she saw Sidney as an inevitable and desirable suitor of Grace 's , but she was beginning to look at every young man with Grace 's future in her mind , and Sidney was merely the pick of the lot at the moment , and he was the pick chiefly because of Emily 's accidental discovery that he wanted to live on a farm . Grace was going to be a beauty and she would attract young men , inspire love , and would unquestionably love in return . If , indeed , she did not love first . When love came to Grace the object of her affection might be a young man who cared nothing for the country life , and Grace might easily abandon a way of life for life itself . Sidney was a good-looking young man with exquisite manners who made an effort to get along well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration foithe rights of others and some intuitive  --  intuitive because he was so young  --  knowledge of human frailty . Emily knew her daughter to be a girl who would make demands on these attributes of Sidney 's . Grace was difficult now , inclined to be lacking in respect where respect was indicated if not due ; she was introspective , and she was often imperious . Emily Caldwell gave thought to the imperiousness , which she blamed partly on the obsequiousness of Connie Schoffstal , but if it had n't been Connie Schoffstal it would be someone else , and so Emily Caldwell did nothing to supplant Connie with a girl of sturdier , more independent character . Moreover , Emily believed in **27;4543;TOOLONG for her daughter , the girl in that position . It was the exercise of a right which Emily believed in . There was no girl better in Fort Penn ; there was no girl quite so good . The facts , as Emily saw them , were that Grace was a Caldwell and a Brock , the best blood in Fort Penn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , because the people of Fort Penn acknowledged some kind of superiority . The Schoffstals had more money , it was true ; the Walls and the Martindales had Newport connections ; but the subtle difference in business and in the social life of Fort Penn was that people came to the Caldwells , while the Caldwells went to nobody . They did just about as they pleased . It was painfully plain to Emily Caldwell that her son was not going to continue that kind of domination . He had a special strength of his own , which was not going to take the form of rebellion , as it might have done if he had possessed a solid talent for one of the arts or even for dissipation ; but he already seemed to have determined to lead his own useless life in the way he chose , and in Fort Penn that took a perverse courage . Grace , on the other hand , had announced her position , and that was to live in Fort Penn , particularly to live on the farm , and without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from there . A husband would be needed to complete that plan , and he would have to be selected ( if the plan were to be followed , and it seemed increasingly desirable as Emily reconsidered it ) for his qualifications as consort and stallion ; a man who would have sense enough to know that he was the gainer in this world 's goods , but not so much the gainer that he would gradually lose his selfrespect . As of that Spring of 1901 Emily Caldwell was content with the status quo , having accepted the compromise that placed her daughter rather than her son in succession as eventual ruler of Fort Penn . The girl had outgrown two typical " crushes " ; one on Charlie Jay , whom92 93Emily recognized as a boy who might have been difficult to deal with in a more serious love affair ; the other on Scotty Bordener , who Emily foresaw would grow into too dull a man to keep Grace out of the divorce courts after the dullnesses of marriage set in . With Charlie and Scotty , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expected to have another fairly soon , and Emily Caldwell was prepared to have to deal with a more romantic experience next time , but all well and good . If the young man filled the bill , Grace could announce her engagement and marry him in a year . If he was not eligible , there were ways to delay an announcement , then to delay the marriage , and if the undesirable romance persisted , Europe was a long way off . Emily had no objection to a comparatively early marriagefor Grace . It was not then the Fort Penn custom to marry at eighteen or nineteen , but Emily believed in setting Fort Penn customs , not in being bound by them . Meanwhile the pick of the lot was behaving in a manner that Emily could not have improved upon if she had given the orders . Ile was in Europe , presumably testing his infatuation for the young Caldwell girl , and , Emily hoped , sowing some wild oats . Emily was satisfied that Sidney had had experiences with women , and she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Italy he had some more . I-ier own first nights with her husband had been trying , to say the least , and as a candidate for marriage with Grace it behooved Sidney to know all there was to know . In her own case Emily 's total ignorance and William 's lack of experience had not turned out badly . They learned together , and they had love on their side . Emily was dubious about the extent of her daughter 's patience . She had no doubt that Grace would go to the marriage bed as ignorant as she herself had been , but having learned the pleasures of passion , and suspecting the depth of it in Grace , Emily was fearful of the effects on Grace 's marriage of unsatisfactory intimate relations . Emily hated to admit it ( and she discussed it with no one , not even her husband ) , but she could easily imagine Grace in bed and naked and duplicating her own discoveries and inventions , but only if the young man were helpful . One never talked about these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives of one 's friends : the pregnant virgins , the young wives who did only what their husbands told them to do , the girls who married men who did not like woman at all , and the wives of rapists . None of these things must happen to Grace . Grace must be perfectly married , to a man who would be a companion , a source of entertainment , and a true partner right up to their climaxes in bed. right up to the delivery of their children . Emily , who was not without humor , wryly admitted that she had no positive way of examining the candidates without going to bed with them herself , and putting aside the fact that no hand but William 's ever had been under her dress , it was too late in the day for any of that sort of thing . But it amused her  --  and she knew it was wicked  --  to hand a young man a cup of tea and , as he took it , to search his countenance for indications of the directions he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only conclusions she came to were that if she were a girl again she would not welcome the advances of young men with cherubic faces ( she suspected they were cruel ) ; men with remarkably small noses ( she invented a theory that they were remarkably small elsewhere ) ; men whose fingernails were too long ( they would scratch ) ; and men who laughed at everything and anything ( they probably were hiding something ) . Sidney Tate 's nose was not large but it was not remarkably small , and he had a high-cheek-boned Englishlook about him that was anything but cherubic . She believed that if he were to hold up his hand , palm facing the viewer , his nails would not extend higher than the tips of his fingers . And when he laughed it was the minutest fraction of a second slow in coming and the joke or the situation had earned the laughter . And then finally , although the two men looked not a bit alike , she conceded that Will Caldwell matched Sidney 's score on these items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grace gets as good a man as Will , she 'll be fortunate . And that , after all , is what I want for her . " All she wanted for herself out of this concern for Grace was to know that her daughter ( and , ex officio , her daughter 's husband ) would occupy the undefined but understood position in Fort Penn that William and Emily Caldwell had held just for her ... . Shortly after Easter a parcel addressed to Emily arrived . It containedtwo identical small ivory fans in their original boxes from Charpentier et Cie. , Paris . One box contained Sidney 's calling card , with nothing written on it ; in the other box the card was written on , in Sidney 's neat , strong hand : " Please do not think me forward . Saw these at Charpentier 's . Tho't of Madame &; Mademoiselle and bought them instantly . S. T. " Now this , Emily told herself , was a worthy young man . He wanted to keep their memory of him alive , so he bought an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother , one for the daughter . The present was just right ; to send it back would be ceremoniously ingracious ; to keep it was to contract to write thank-you notes . Thenotes would have to express the polite hope that Emily and Grace would see him at some indefinite date ; whereupon it was up to this tactful young man to present himself , if only accidentally , where he could be seen and more important , where he could see . He could see Grace again ; that was what he wanted ; if she was as lovely , as attractiveas he remembered her , he would conspire with Paul Reichelderfer and Fort Penn friends in order that he might see her again . If  --  and Emily well in advance had her doubts about this  --  Grace no longer appealed to him , he could go his way , to South Africa to fight for the Boers , for all Emily cared , and all he would have lost would be theprice of two irresistible ivory fans . " Dear Sidney : The exquisite fans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged me to return them with thanks . It was kind of you to remember us when you were so many miles away . My impulse to return the fans was weakened by my realization that my daughter Grace is no longer the child we have been thinkingher , as after all she is " coming out " next winter , and I trust that you will still be in quest of a farm so that the holidays once again will find you in our midst and that you can be present on that occasion . But pray do not hold off visiting us until then . The " latch string " is always out for you at our house . . . Emily Brock CaldwellDear Mr. Tate : I wish to express my sincere thanks for the beautiful ivory fan which you so kindly purchased in Paris . It is an excellent specimenof the fine workmanship one expects of the French artisans and I am already the envy of the few close friends whom I havepermitted to see it . To say that I was pleased would be to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convey my appreciation . Hoping that we will have the pleasure of another visit from you soon , I remain , Sincerely yours , Grace CaldwellA conversation between Grace and Connie Schoffstal , which took place in the summerhouse at the farm , late in June 1901 : CONNIE : " Where did you get that ? " GRACE : " Get w-nat ? Oh , this fan ? " CONNIE : " Yes . " GRACE : " Did n't I ever show this to you before ? " coNNIE : " Of course ycu did n't . You know you didn't. " 96GRACE : " I do n't any such thing , know I did n't . You know , Connie , I do n't show you everything . " CONNIE : " Nearly . " GRACE : " I beg to differ with you . I have presents I never showed you . I 'm sure I have lots of things you never saw . " CONNIE : " Aw , what , for instance ? " GRACE : " Well , dear me , you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got last Christmas or when I was in Cape May . " CONNIE : " I do n't remember you getting any presents in Cape May . " GRACE : " Well , I did though , whether you remember it or not . Maybe I did n't happen to show them to you . " CONNIE : " What , for instance ? " GRACE : " There you go again , what for instance . I ca n't remember almost a year ago what presents I got . " CONNIE : " Well , what one present did you get then ? " GRACE : " Well , for instance , did you notice on my straw hat , a striped hatband ? Blue and white ? " CONNIE : " No , or maybe I did . What 's a hatband ? Anybody can have a hatband . " GRACE : " Oh , is that so ? Well , if you 're so smart , then perhaps you know all about what the hatband stood for . " CONNIE : " What ? " GRACE : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's the use of my telling you ? " CONNIE : " I do n't say I know everything . " GRACE : " But you act as if you do . " CONNIE : " What 's special about the hatband ? " GRACE : " Did you ever hear of Delta Phi ? " CONNIE : " What is it , some fraternity ? " GRACE : " It 's the best fraternity at the University of Pennsylvania . Everybody says it 's the best . " CONNIE : " I never heard anybody say it . I never even heard the name mentioned before . " GRACE : " I 'm not talking about you . " CONNIE : " W'Vell , I 'm somebody , and I never heard of it . " GRACE : " Oh , well , let 's not talk about it then . I would n't think ofboring Lady Vere de Vere . But personally if I never heard of Delta Phi I 'd never display my ignorance . " CONNIE : " How could you if you never heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bring it up . And if somebody else brought it Q7up how could you talk about it if you never heard of it ? If I do n't know anything about Phi Delta  --  " GRACE : " Delta Phi . " CONNIE : " I do n't care if it 's Alpha Ipsa I Eta Pi , I never heard of it , so why should I let on I did ? " GRACE : " Oh , dear . " Grace languidly fanned herself and in so doing re-aroused Connie'scuriosity . CONNIE : " YOU never did tell me where you got the fan . " GRACE : " I beg your pardon ? " CONNIE : " Oh , you heard what I said . " GRACE : " But truly I did n't , Connie . I was a thousand miles away . " CONNIE : " I asked you where you got the fan . " GRACE : " It was a present , I think I told you . " CONNIE : " I know but who from ? " GRACE : " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delta Phi hatband . " CONNIE : " Oh , is that what the hatband was ? Fraternity colors . I thought you had to be engaged . " GRACE : " Did you ? " CONNIE : " But you 're not engaged , because you got the hatband last summer and you got the fan . . . " GRACE : " See ? You do n't know when I got the fan . " CONNIE : " When did you ? " GRACE : " You 're right . I got the fan after I got the hatband . " CONNIE : " Who gave you the hatband ? " GRACE : " Who gave me the hatband ? " CONNIE : " One of your cousins ? " GRACE : " That 's for me to know and you to find out . " CONNIE : " I do n't think you 're being a bit nice , that 's what I think . I 'm not going to ask you any more questions . I 'm supposed to be your best friend , and for almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a single thing about them . I only wish I could go home . I never kept any secrets from you . " GRACE : " You talk as if I 'd been mean to you . " CONNIE : " That 's what you have been , mean . Cruel . " GRACE : " Cruel ? Was I cruel ? When was I cruel ? " CONNIE : " Just now . Out of the blue sky you suddenly started tellingme about presents you got and you never said anything to me about them before this . Nobody likes being left out in the cold by their best friend . " GRACE : " Oh , I 'm sorry , Connie . Maybe I have been cruel , but it was n't intentional . If I was cruel and mean it was pure thoughtless . Thoughtlessness , on my part . I 've had things on my mind that I could n't tell anybody , not even you . " CONNIE : " What things ? " GRACE : " Oh , at Cape May , the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a partner when we played tennis . " CONNIE : " Yes , I wish I could play better . " GRACE : " Oh , but that was only an excuse , Connie . He was always trying to be alone with me . " CONNIE : " What was his name ? " GRACE : " His name ? Oh , I 'd never tell anyone his name , not even you . He 's engaged to be married . " CONNIE : " But you could tell me . I do n't know any of the peopledown at Cape May , and besides , I never broke any of your secrets . " GRACE : " I know , but I 'd  --  I could never say his name out loud . " CONNIE : " - Whisper it . " GRACE : " No , not even whispering . Well  --  Jack . " CONNIE : " Jack ? I do n't remember you saying anything about anybodynamed Jack . " GRACE : " No , naturally . That 's the first time I ever said his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss you ? " GRACE : " Oh , no , Connie . " CONNIE : " But you let other boys kiss you . " GRACE : " But I never wanted them to . They were always the ones that wanted to . " CONNIE : " Oh , that is n't what you told me . " GRACE : " What did I tell you ? I never said I wanted them to kiss me . " . . CONNIE : " Scotty Bordener and Charlie Jay . " GRACE : " I do n't remember saying any such thing , Connie . If they wanted to kiss me so much that I could n't stop them . But I never wanted them to . " CONNIE : " But I remember one time last winter and I was spendingthe night at your house and you said to me , Would n't it be nice to have two boys to kiss ? ' " GRACE : " Connie , you must have dreamt that , or I was joking . Either one . " CONNIE : " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because I was awake and you made me scratch your back . " GRACE : " Oh , well then I was joking . " CONNIE : " Well , I misunderstood you then , but I 'm glad you werejoking . I do n't think you ought to kiss so many boys . " GRACE : " I do n't kiss so many boys . You sound as if I kissed boysand kissed boys ... " CONNIE : " Well , not so many boys , but quite a few times the onesyou do . " GRACE : " How can you say such a thing , Connie ? Do you think I just kiss them and kiss them or let them kiss me when I 'm alone with them ? Scotty , for instance ? " CONNIE : " That 's what you said , that 's what you told me . " GRACE : " That 's where you misunderstood . Just because I was alone with Scotty  --  he was lucky to get one kiss . If he told you anything else he was a damn liar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . " GRACE : " Well , or Charlie Jay . " CONNIE : " I-le did n't either . It was just you always made me thinkyou enjoyed kissing . " GRACE : " Oh . Well , I did that on purpose . I wanted you to  --  if you felt like kissing a boy , or letting him kiss you , I did n't want you to think I 'd tell on you or think you were n't nice if you let them . " CONNIE : " Oh . " GRACE : " YOU see what I mean , Connie ? " CONNIE : " Uh-huh . " GRACE : " That must have been why I let you think I enjoyed it . " CONNIE : " Uh-huh . " GRACE : " Because I do n't like boys . Young boys . The person thatgave me the fan , do you know how old he is ? " CONNIE : " How old ? " GRACE : " Twenty-two years old . " CONNIE : " Twenty-two ? Is n't that how old Brock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how old Sidney is . They went to Lawrenceville together . " CONNIE : " Sidney What's-Isis-Name ? That visited you last Christmas ? He 's the one gave you the fan ? Ile was only at your house onenight . " GRACE : " That 's why I did n't tell you . I hardly said three words to him and he went abroad . To Europe . And when he came back he brought me this fan . " CONNIE : " How did he get it to you ? Does your mother know ? " GRACE : " He brought her one , but he had to do that , to cover up . " CONNIE : " She let you keep it ? It looks expensive . " lociGRACE : " It 's from Paris , hand-made . Of course she let me keep it . " CONNIE : " My mother would n't of let me keep it . " GRACE : " I know , but your mother 's different . My mother 's letting me come out next winter . " CONNIE : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you know it , but your mother wo n't let you . Yourmother 's different than mine . We live one way , and you live an-other . " CONNIE : " Yes , I know . But what about Sidney ? " GRACE : " Sidney Tate ? I would n't say this to another soul . You must say may God strike you dead if you ever say this to anyone . Even me . You must never repeat this even to me , unless I bring it up first . " CONNIE : " I wo n't . " GRACE : " You did n't say God can strike you dead . " CONNIE : " May God strike me dead if I ever repeat this . " GRACE : " I think Sidney Tate 's in love with me . " CONNIE : " In love with you ? Grace , how could he be if you only saw him that one time ? " GRACE : " I believe you can tell . " CONNIE : " How ? " GRACE : " The fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see me again . " CONNIE : " Grace ! " GRACE : " Yes . " They were silent a moment . CONNIE : " Did you get a letter from him ? " GRACE : " No . But Mother did . He makes excuses to write to her , and I 'm sure , it 's plain , he wants to see me again . I wrote to him twice . Once when he left his hair brushes at our house . I wrote to him because Mother had a felon on her finger and told him we were sending the brushes . But that was an excuse . He did n't forget his brushes . He left them , but he did n't forget them , if you know what I mean . And the other time , I wrote and thanked him for thefan . " CONNIE : " Goodness ! " GRACE : " Uh-huh . " CONNIE : " Are you in love with him ? " GRACE : " Time will be the judge of that . " CONNIE : " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , why should n't I ? " IO1Part of a colloquy between William Caldwell and his wife Emily , which took place in the sitting room of the house at the farm , July , 1901 : WILLIAM CALDWELL : " YOU know , the house seems deserted withoutGrace . Not deserted , but . .. " EMILY : " Yes , I know what you mean . " WILLIAM : " The first time she was ever away so long alone . I hope she does n't get homesick . " EMILY : " I hope not , but I do n't think she will . " WILLIAM : " I s'pose not . Plenty of young people there , Cape May . " EMILY : " Yes , and a great many of them she 'll know from last summer . " WILLIAM : " That 's true . " EMILY : " Mm-hmm . " WILLIAM : " And even if she does get a little homesick , I 'm not against that . " EMILY : " Oh , it might be a good thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outsiders . " EMILY : " Exactly . " WILLIAM : " And , especially young men . That 's the only objection I have to her staying home instead of going to boarding-school . I wish Brock could have stayed at Princeton till he finished . So she could meet more young men . " EMILY : " Why , Will , it 's usually the mother that worries about those things . " WILLIAM : " Aheh-ahem . A certain mother I know never seems to give the matter a thought , so it 's up to a certain father to  --  " EMILY : " Oh , I think about it , Will , but I do n't worry about it . You watch . Grace 's going to be a real beauty , and if a town like Fort Penn gets the reputation of having one beauty , just one , the young men come from miles around . " WILL : " Yes , that 's very true . I used to hear the fellows talk about a girl in Lancaster , or maybe it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up coaching parties and drive all the way to Lancaster , and the real reason they went was because there was supposed to be a great beauty there . " EMILY : " Jessica Shambaugh . " WILL : " That 's exactly who it was ! Lancaster . By George , you remembered that . Jessica Shambaugh . Married  --  let me think . Married I believe a man from Baltimore . How did you remember her name ? " 102EMILY : " Oh , all of us girls knew about her . You came very close to going on one of those coaching parties . " WILL : " So I did . . . But you saw to it that I did n't ? " EMILY : " I saw to it that you did n't . " WILL : " Hmm . Thirty years later I find that out . How did you stop me from going ? " EMILY : " It was n't so hard . I said to you , What do you think of those silly boys driving all the way to Lancaster to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What Fort Penn girl could ever again have the least respect for a young man that 'd drive that far just to look at a face he 'd never seen . ' " will , : " Hmm . Well , well . I hope for Grace 's sake the young men nowadays are n't so easily dissuaded . " EMILY : " They wo n't be . Nowadays you can drive from Lancaster to Fort Penn by machine . And our daughter is handsomer than Jessica Shambaugh ever thought of being . " WILL : " You have given the matter some thought . " EMILY : " Naturally , I 'll think about it , but I refuse to worry about it . " A snatch of dialogue which was spoken in the dining room of a cottage in Cape May , New Jersey , July , 1901 : GRACE CALDWELL : " Good morning , Cousin Clarence . " CLARENCE BROCK : " Good morning , Grace . You had your break- fast . " GRACE : " Yes , thank you . I 'm going for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk . I wish I could be going for a walk . This damned gout . When you reach my age , Grace , do n't get gout . " GRACE : " I 'll try not to . " CLARENCE BROCK : " You do that . Say , you 're pretty as a picture this morning . And of course ! Of course ! You 're still wearing the Delta Phi colors . That 's the ticket ! " GRACE : " I kept it all winter , Cousin Clarence . " CLARENCE BROCK : " Good girl . If I were thirty years younger you 'd be wearing my badge too , we 're not that close cousins . " GRACE : " Thank you , Cousin Clarence . " A letter to Paul Reichelderfer from Sidney Tate , November , 1901 : Dear PauI : . . . By the way , I am going to hold you to your invitation of last summer . In case it may have slipped your mind I hereby take the103liberty of reminding you that when you were visiting us at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " girlish confidence " on the subject of a certain Miss G. C. Remember I confessed how smitten I was by the diamond in the diadem of Fort Penn ? Well , old chap , you gave me a carte-blanche invitation to the ReichchIcrfcrmanor house any time I felt that I could no longer live without feasting my eye on the young lady in question . Candidly , my thoughts returned to her many times , and more than once I all but yielded to the temptation to go " farm-hunting " in the vicinityof Lebanon as an excuse to visit the neighboring metropolis of Fort Penn and accidentally on purpose drop in on my old schoolmate Brock Caldwell in the hope of seeing his sister . I kept a firm pressure on the curb bit , however , and did not avail myself of this slim opportunity of catching a glimpse of Miss C. Now the time has come and I have a legitimate reason to see her . I have , in point of fact , been invited to see her . Joy is me ! for I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is father to the thought , but knowing the Caldwells for the gentle-folk they are , I should hazard a guess that not many days will pass ere I receive an invitation to visit Stan Ross , George Wall , or Les Poffenberger , as I have sent my acceptanceto the Caldwells and they will in all likelihood see to my being put up at the home of some mutual friend . I prefer , however , to be able to say that I shall be visiting you , and then if you can arrange to get me invited to a mutual friend 's house , all well &; good . I should not like to have the Caldwells think me their responsibility as they undoubtedly will now that I have said I intend to be present at the Ball . You understand how I feel and why . Of course if your mother has made other arrangements I will understand , but inasmuch as it was through you that I met Miss C. , I prefer to renew acquaintance under your auspices . If you have no special preference among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend in college than the others listed above . . . Earlier in this chronicle mention was made of the fact that Grace and Sidney followed several plots on their way to the altar , and it was stated that they always believed that they almost did not get together at all . So far as they themselves were aware , they were telling no more than the truth , but it was not the whole truth . Moreover , Emily Caldwell , astute though she was , had to have some outside help in bringing about the marriage of her daughter and the young man who , after the Christmas holidays of 1901-1902 , not only remained the104pick of the lot , but became in Emily 's eyes the only suitable candidate for the position of husband to Grace . In the weeks succeeding the holidays , Emily 's maneuverings lost all tentativeness ; they were planned without thought of an alternate candidate , with Emily allowingonly tactically for a change of heart by either Grace or Sidney . They were attracted mutually , affection would increase , love would ensue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than death itself could now disrupt Emily 's plans for Grace and Sidney . She felt altogethercapable of handling anything and everything less than death . She would space out their absences from each other and keep alert for the signs that one or the other was in danger of being attracted to a third party . Of Sidney 's love for Grace she was certain ; of Grace 's feeling for Sidney she was less confident . Grace was not in love with Sidney ; that Emily knew . And Grace was a girl who just possibly might become dangerously infatuated with a more dashing , possibly unscrupulous young man . Emily therefore made a show of devoted supervision of Grace 's social life , such as it was in Fort Penn , and in so doing allowed Grace to see no young man whose charm and appearancecompared favorably with Sidney 's . Sidney was personable enough in his own right , but to be on the safe side Emily protected him against the possibility of invidious comparisons . Death itself , the only factor which Emily conceded to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerically , two deaths  --  actually hastened the marriage of Sidney and Grace .. . It was known as the Baum Case . On a murky afternoon in February , 1902 , one Louis F. Baum entered the outer office of Dr. Angelo Terranova , and found it empty . He thereupon broke open the door of the inner office . There , on the leather-cushioned operating table , was Baum 's wife Christine , naked , as frequently happens in physicians ' offices , but with her was the doctor , also naked . Baum fired five shots from a .32 caliber nickel-plated Hopkins &; Allen revolver . Two of the bullets struck Terranova , one below the left eye and the other above the heart . A third and fourth bullet struck Christine Baum in the right ear and in the right side of the neck below the ear . The fifth bullet creased the doctor 's shoulder and passed on to the glass-fronted medicine chest . The office occupied two rooms on the first floor of a frame house , one of a row in Shoptown across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Side of Fort Penn . The sound of the shots was heard in a grocery store two doors north of Doctor Terranova 's office and in the corner saloon two doors to the south . Men and women rushed to the street from105the grocery store and the saloon in time to see Baum running to the Pennsy yards . The shots also brought Mrs. Terranova downstairs to her husband 's office and her screams attracted several women shoppersto the office . One of these women had presence of mind enough to return to the street and call out , pointing to the escaping Baum , " Stop the murderer ! " The cry was taken up by the other men and women , and Baum was caught by Special Officers Donovan and Malarkey , of the Pennsy police , as he was about to board a departing freight train . Feeling , according to the Fort Penn Sentinel , ran high in the Italian colony , where Doctor Terranova was a leader in social and fraternal circles . Notwithstanding the inferences which were drawn from the position and condition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christine Baum ) was believed innocent of wrongdoing , the victim of a jealous husband who had murdered the doctor and his patient , and stripped and rearranged the corpses . Despitethe fact that few members of the Italian colony were qualified voters , other prominent Italo-Americans were able to enlist the aid of a far-seeing politician in an effort to see that justice was done . Little came of this movement , however , as Baum told reporters that he intended to plead the unwritten law and throw himself on the mercy of the court , by which he apparently meant that he was going to plead guilty . Baum , who earned his living as a clerk in the Fort Penn Water Company office , was a slight , bewildered man of thirty-seven who at first refused to hire a lawyer . His wife had been a stylish stout blonde , six years younger than he , and they had been married twelve years . They had two children , the younger of whom was said , ; after the homicides , to bear an unmistakable resemblance to the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor 's office , but Baum explained that he doctored with Terranova because Terranovawas cheap . All the other doctors in town , he said , were too dear . If Baum had shot any other Italian he would have been allowed to take the least possible punishment , such as two years for manslaughter . But Baum had shot one of the three most important Italians in Fort Penn , and he also had shot his own wife , who was not Italian at all but good , German stock , for which reason there was some reaction against Baum among his own people . The grand jury found a true bill against Baum and the case was put on the calendar for the March term of the Nesquehela County Criminal Court . Among the reporters and lawyers at Fort Penn itro6was not difficult to find several men who were willing to bet that Baum 's goose was cooked , and that the best he could hope for was life imprisonment . The Baum Case , with its adulterous aspect , and an Italian principalat that , was hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contented itself with other topics . In the Caldwell household the case was not mentioned except by Emily to William , the backstairs people among themselves , Brock to the members of the Fort Penn Club , and Grace to Connie Schoffstal . " Will , " said Emily , one evening , " I came home before dinner and found Grace reading the Sentinel account of that Italian-doctor murder . " " Oh , dear , " said Will Caldwell . " Well , are n't you going to say something at the paper ? " " No , Emily . I never like to interfere there . " " But you must . Not only Grace , but other young girls the same age , reading that scandal . " " I agree , the details are explicit , to say the least . Judging from the bullet wounds lie must have been on top of her , and I heard some more about it , too . " " Of course he was , but we ca n't have thoughts like that in Grace 's mind . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper . " " I agree with you , I agree with you , but then it 's your duty to keep the paper out of her hands . I 'm not going to interfere at the Sentinel office . They know their business , and that 's final . Sorry , Emily . " Two weeks after the preceding conversation Emily was sitting in her sewing-room , second floor back , working on a throw and nursing a cold . She heard the doorbell and presently May , the upstairs girl , appeared : " It 's Mrs. Jay , ma'am , wishes to speak with you . " " Mrs. Jay ? What does she want ? She 's never been here in the morning before . All right , ask her to cone up please . " Emily pulled the comforter over her legs and tucked it under to appear more invalid-like . " Good morning , Jessie . I 'm sorry to make you climb the stairs , but doctor 's orders . " " I hope it 's nothing serious , Emily . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you know . " " Oh , " said Jessie . " Yes . " She was ill at ease , but obviously deter mined to speak her piece. ionIj " Take off your coat . Sit over there , Jessie . I can tell you have something on your mind . " " Thank you , Emily . Yes , I have something on my mind . Somethingterrible , or I would n't bother you , sick and all . " " If I can help you , you can always count on me , you know that . " " Well , I wo n't take any longer than necessary , " said Jessie . " Take as long as you like . That 's what old friends are for . Whensomeone 's in trouble . " " It 's not me personally , Emily . It 's a cousin of mine . My first cousin . You 've read about or heard about that murder , the Italian doctor and the white  --  I mean , American woman ? " " Yes . " " Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first cousin . " " He is ? How ? " " Do you remember your German ? Baum ? " " Baum ? Baum means tree . Tree ! Jessie Tree . I never think of you as Jessie Tree any more . Oh , dear . Nobody else knows it , do they ? I mean to say , have people bothered you , Jessie ? " " No , I do n't guess anybody 's thought of it , Emily . My father changed his name from Baum to Tree , but Louis ' father kept the Baum . " " Jessie , excuse me , but I think you 'd better sit in this chair , here . I see they 've opened the top windows in the bay window and you 'll be in a draught . May catch cold . " " Thank you , Emily . " Jessie moved to the chair Emily indicated . " But I 'm sorry , I did n't want to interrupt , but you 've been worrying , I can see that , and worry lowers your resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Notta tall . Now go on about your cousin . I do n't know who he is , exactly . I remember your father very well . Frederick Tree . FrederickL . Tree . " " Yes , Frederick Louis Tree . My uncle 's name was Louis Frederick Baum , and this man in all this trouble is Louis Frederick Baum , Junior , although he never uses the Junior because his father died , oh , thirty years ago or more . He was raised by his mother , my Aunt Esther . I do n't think you ever knew her . I 'm sure you did n't . She was from Lancaster County , father was a farmer . Louis ' mother , this woman I 'm speaking about , she was very poor , but she kept a roof over her head and had food to live on by doing sewing and fancywork , housework by the day , and managed somehow . Whenever I think I have a hard time I think of Aunt Esther . Well , she raised him , Louis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job with the Water Companyand he 's been there ever since . " " And never any trouble before this ? " " Never . An upright , decent man . Handled money for the Water Company for many years . Did n't drink or smoke . Reliable , trustworthy . Was n't what you 'd call a Beau Brummel by any manner or means , and she was all right , too . Her children , one girl and one boy  --  the boy 's still a baby  --  they were neat and clean , and her house was neat and clean . No sign of anything out of the way . But I guess she must have been carrying on with this doctor , the Italian , and some way Louis found out about it or got his suspicions aroused . You know  --  or you do n't know , but I do . Sooner or later the wife or the husband finds out , hears something . " " Yes , I suppose so , " said Emily . She was wondering whether Jessie had come to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she could not expect to get off that easily . " It must have been a dreadful time for him , " said Jessie . " Never known anything but work and poverty all his life . His mother workingherself to death , and she did , she did . And then he works like a slave for a miserable salary , and having to look neat and clean with an office job , keeping up appearances . And then I suppose he thought it was worth it all to have a nice home , with a good wife and two nice children . Then to find out that the woman he 'd been doing all this for was carrying on with this Italian . A pleasure woman for a man with a wife and children of his own , and doing it while his own wife was upstairs ! She used to go to his office , you know . She pretended she had something wrong with her , but what was wrong with her was . . . " She stopped to take a deep breath . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or say she got what she deserved , " said Emily . " But a woman as reckless as that , maybe she never even thought of the consequences . I suppose with a doctor he could see to it that she did n't become pregnant . " " He could see to it ? He did n't see to it . I understand the younger child belongs to him . Poor Louis thinks so . " " Have you been to see him ? " " No , Emily , I have n't . I 'm ashamed of myself to lack the courage , but what little position I have in Fort Penn , I 've been afraid to jeopardize it . " " No one would think the less of you , Jessie . " " That 's not true , Emily . For myself I do n't care , but I have a son and I want to see him established . That 's what I 've worked for . " rog " I think you 've been very successful with Charlie . I do n't doubt for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Do you think so , Emily ? I 'm glad you do . " " But on thinking it over , I do n't s'pose Fort Penn is any different from any other place when it comes to gossip , and I 'm inclined to agree with you . It 's better for you and Charlie 's future to keep out of this . Is that why you came to see me , Jessie ? You wanted my advice ? And of course , I 'll say right away , I 'm honored by your confiding in me . " Jessie looked away from her before continuing . " No , Emily , I did n't only come to you for advice . I came to you for more practical help . " " And I think you knew in your heart that to ask it is to receive it , if it 's in my power . " " Thank you , but this is  --  " " Is it money , Jessie ? I have my own , and Will would n't have to know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't money . It 's something else . It 's power ! I 'd never borrow money that I could n't some day pay back , but you have power , and I want to borrow some without any hope of ever paying it back . " " Well , tell me , Jessie . " " All right . I want you to get Mr. O'Connell to be Louis ' lawyer . ' " Desmond O'Connell ? " " Yes . " " You want me to ask him to take your cousin 's case , defend him . " " You do n't have to ask him . Will Caldwell can ask him . I know you 'll tell Will everything I 've told you this morning . I 'm prepared for that and it 's only right . But that 's what I plead with you to do : ask Will to ask Desmond O'Connell to take the case . If he does n't , my cousin will hang . I have n't seen Louis , but I 'm in touch with somebody that has seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take Desmond O'Connell to save Louis . Louis does n't care what happens to him . He wants to plead guilty and throw himself on the mercy of the court , not even hire a lawyer . But he ca n't do that . Mr. Eisenhuth , the district attorney , is n't going to let him plead guilty . Eisenhuth  --  you know , that politician  --  he wants to hang Louis , and the person I 've been talking to says Louis as good as has the rope around his neck right this minute . He did n't say O'Connell could save him . What he said was it would take a Desmond O'Connell to save him and even so he had his doubts . " " Oh . " Emily lay back in her chair . " That 's what I mean by your power , Emily . You have the power . If Will goes to Desmond O'Connell and tells him to take the case , Louis has a chance . Desmond O'Connell wo n't say no to Will . Nobodysays no to Will in this town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Just about . " " Perhaps . Will usually gets what he wants , but he does n't abuse that privilege , if that 's what you 'd call it . He gets what he asks for , as a rule , but that 's partly because he does n't get to the point of askingthings that he knows are useless to ask for . You see what I mean ? " " Yes . " " So , assuming I went to Will , and Will went to Desmond , why should Desmond undertake to defend your cousin ? " " Because Will Caldwell asked him to . " " But Desmond would want to know why on earth Will was interestinghimself in the worst murder case we 've had in years . What could Will say to that ? " " He could say  --  he could tell Mr. O'Connell that  --  well , just what I 've told you this morning . " " That 's another person you 'd be confiding in , Jessie . " " I 'm not afraid to confide in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Then I think you should have gone to Desmond direct , instead of coming to us . " " I thought of that . He 'd turn me down . I do n't know him very well , but I know him well enough to know he 'd never be Louis " lawyer to please me . I 'm nobody . " " You must n't underestimate yourself that way , Jessie . You 're somebody . You 're a brave , conscientious woman . Possibly you are right about Desmond , though . It 's not so much that you 're nobody , but he thinks he 's somebody . And I guess he is , if he can save a man from the gallows . But that 's not the point you and I are discussing . In fact it is n't a discussion any more . It 's a matter for me to decide : whether to go to Will and have him go to Desmond O'Connell .. . Jessie , I do n't see how I can do it . " " Why not ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interfere . I 'll tell you something . I asked Will when this thing first happened , I asked him to speak to the people down at the Sentinel to stop the articles about the murders . I came home one afternoon and found Gracerro rrrreading one , and I was shocked and worried . But when I spoke to Will he refused to interfere at the paper . He said he never interfered . I know how you must feel , that I have n't given you any very good reason for not getting Will to speak to Desmond O'Connell , but I honestly believe we ought to stay out of it . On the other hand , if you yourself can persuade Desmond , I give you permission to say we 'll foot the bill , but as to our going to Desmond  --  sorry as I am , the answeris no . " " Sorry as I am , the answer is no , ' " said Jessie . " Louis Baum , I Emily Caldwell , sentence you to hang by the neck until you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I quite deserve that , Jessie . I 've made you an offer . " " Knowing that Desmond O'Connell probably would n't even see me . " " I do n't know that . If you sent in your card , he 'd see you . He 's a gentleman . He 'd see you . " " And put me out like a gentleman , too , I daresay . Or maybe not even that after I told him what I came for . " " Well , you can try , and my offer holds good any time . " " How gracious of you , Emily . " " Now , Jessie , I think you 'd better go . I know you 're disappointed in me , and maybe rightly so , but there 's no use having recriminationsand saying things we 'll regret later . If you talk to Desmond and he wants some assurance that we 'll pay his fee , tell him to get in touch with me . " " Desmond O'Connell is out of the question and you know it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it , " said Emily , straightening her shawl . " But I have something else to say , and it has nothing to do with Desmond O'Connell . " " Now , Jessie , please . I 'm tired and not feeling well , and certainly not up to any unpleasant words . " " Be a good girl , Jessie , and go your way . You 've had your audience with the queen . But I 'm not a good girl . I 'm the cousin of a murderer , the worst murder case we 've had in years . " " Oh , I 'm sorry I said that . " " I do n't care whether you said it or not , because it 's true . It was so bad that you wanted to have Will interfere and keep it away from the innocent eyes of that pure little daughter of yours . " " Now I do insist on your going . You have no right to speak that way of Grace . " " Yes I have . I can speak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is . " " Oh , go away . You do n't see Grace from one year 's end to an-other . " " No , I do n't see Grace from one year 's end to another . She 's careful to come to my house when I 'm out . That 's why I do n't seeher . She 's not interested in me . She 's interested in my boy . How long since I 've been invited to this house ? A long time . But my son had your daughter in this house , in her own room . And she liked itenough to come to my house time after time , and time after time he had his pleasure with her . " " You crazy-woman , get out . " " I discharged a yellow girl for doing the same things your highand-mightyprincess did in my house . I had to send my boy away , out of the State , before she ruined him . " " You 're a raving maniac . " " Then have me locked up , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  do n't ask your innocent little daughter if I 'm telling the truth , if I 'm a raving maniac . Ask your son . Ask Brock Caldwell if he didn'tstand outside the bedroom while my boy was taking his pleasure with the little princess . " Emily looked at her for a moment , the pitying look of a fighter who has been struck down but knows he can get up and win , is going to get up and win , and is going to be unmerciful in winning . " Even you could n't invent this story , so I suppose it 's true . But do you thinkyou can blackmail us with it ? Do you think you can do anything at all with it ? " " Yes , " said Jessie , whispering . " I just did , Emily . I did do something with it . I could n't blackmail you with the story , but I hurt you . I really hurt you , did n't I ? That 's all I wanted to do . I was never goingto tell anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you refused to help Louis , I 'd hurt you in a way you 'd never forget . And you 'll never forget this . Is n't that true , Emily ? " " It 's true , Jessie . It 's true . But I 'm still me , and you 're still you . I imagine that hurts you almost as much . " Jessie Jay left then , and Emily was alone with her misery , her tears . After a while she took to her bed and left word that she did notwant to be disturbed by anyone except Mr. Will Caldwell . Sheusually spoke of her husband and her son as Mr. Caldwell and Mr. Brock , but she wanted no mistake about this order . She heard the comings and goings of the household at luncheon , when Grace came home from school . She slept a little in the afternoon , so that by the time Will came home she was ready to speak to him , and ready to handle him . He kissed her , asked her how she was , and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 'll live ? " he said . " I 'll live forever , " she said . " After today . " " Oh . Did you have a bad time today ? " " Not with my illness . I had a caller , " she said . " See if those doors are closed tight , will you please ? " He tried the doors and they were snugly closed . " Who was your visitor , to occasion door-closing and low tones ? " " Jessie Jay , " she said . " She came to me with some information that I did n't know and I 'm sure you do n't . This man Baum , that murdered his wife and the doctor ? " " Yes . " " Jessie 's first cousin . Do you remember that Jessie 's father changed his name from Baum to Tree ? " " Well , I do remember it now , but I had n't thought of it , " said WiII . " Go on . " " She wants us to get Desmond O'Connell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it will take Desmond to save Baum from the gallows . " " I would n't be a bit surprised if she 's right , and I 'm not at all sure Desmond could get him off . But why are we involved ? " " She said Desmond would n't take the case if she asked him , but if we asked him he would . " " But why should we ask him ? " said Will . " We do n't know Baum , and besides , Desmond hardly ever takes criminal cases . " " Well , I think we ought to ask him , Will . " " Why ? " " I think we owe it to ourselves . Jessie 's always been a friend of ours , not close , but in our circle of friends , and her son Charlie 's a friend of Brock 's , and they do represent something . " " In other words , members of our clahss . " " Yes , " she said . " Well , if we 're going to start looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope the Schoffstal clan stays out of trouble . We 'd need a thousand Desmond O'Connells . But I suppose114you 're right . If we belong to a clahss , or a class , it 's not worth much if we do n't come to the rescue when one of us gets in trouble . " " Thank you , Will . " " However , as I see it , " he said , rubbing his brow , " people will wonder why Desmond suddenly takes up the defense of someone he obviously never heard of . They 'll ask questions about that . " " Desmond can cope with that situation , but I have an answer all ready for him . He can say that Baum 's home was violated and he took the law into his own hands . " " Probably exactly what Desmond will say , " said Will . " And what if they ask who 's paying Desmond  --  and who is paying Desmond ? " " Nobody . If necessary we will , or I will , but you must convince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the home and the clahss . If Desmond wants to be a member of the clahss , let him pay his dues . " " Do n't worry about that , if there 's a clahss Desmond 's a member of it . " The next morning Emily wrote a note and sent it by her maid : " Will is speaking to Desmond today . You are not to reveal your connection with L. F. B. unless called upon to do so , nor are you to attempt to see Desmond . " She did not sign the note . Later in the day a dozen hothouse roses arrived for Emily . The card read : " I can not forgivemyself . Some day I hope you will forgive me.  --  Jessie . " May , the maid , was waiting to see what Emily wanted done with the flowers . " Take those things down to the furnace and burn them , " said Emily . " Yes ma'am , " said May . Emily was extremely careful not to indicate , after Jessie Jay 's disclosures , that Grace or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone with either of them ( an easy task in Brock 's case ) during the next week ; she was sure of herself , as sure of herself as any woman that ever lived , but wanted to guard against the temptation , the impulse to ask questions of Grace and of Brock . She was certain that if she ever asked Brock questions which would indicate the extent of her information , Brock would blow his brains out , or leave home , and she wanted neither . If she were to ask Grace an informativequestion , Grace would lie and might change into a tiresomeliar , and so far as she knew , except for the episode ( as Emily called it ) with Charlie Jay , Grace never had been a liar . Technically , she had not lied even then ; or perhaps it was more accurate to say , she had lied then only technically . It was technically a lie to say that you115had been with Connie Schoffstal when the whole truth would have included a mention of a visit to Charlie Jay 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secret if no one asked you a question that relatal to the secret . Technicalities to one side , Emily found herselfbelieving that Grace had not lied to her , and as she examined that belief she commened to have a new respect for Grace 's handling of the whole Jay business . For a woman who spent virtually no time in the worldly society of Philadelphia and New York , Emily Caldwell had an extraordinarily worldly point of view . Her speech included " No girl ever did such-and-such , " but she knew better . She could say , " No girl goes skating alone with a young man until she 's engaged , " but she knew about juggled dates on birth certificates and long , long trips away from home that were not the result of proper behavior . In Fort Penn she knew of at least one child who must have been born at the age of seven or eight months , and not merely seven or eight months in utero . She knew of another case in Fort Penn where a young man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nose and the father 's red hair . Emily admitted that she had been at fault somewhere in not keeping an eye on Grace and in not conveying to her , without breaking the custom of saying nothing , the knowledge that a boy 's pecker ( as Emily called it and as Will called it ) could make a girl have a baby , and that no girl had a baby before she was married . Emily was rather grateful to Grace for keeping her secret , whatever it was . If the girl no longer was a virgin , she at least had not become a moody or hysterical non-virgin . To all outward appearances , there had been no change in her , and therefore except for the nincompoop Brock , and the now terrified Jessie Jay , no one in the world could say anything about Grace . There was Charlie Jay , to be sure , but Charlie was in all probability the most terrified of all . There was an excellent chance , Emily told herself , that Charlie and Grace had clone nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fondlings , kissings . No matter what Jessie Jay believed , Emily remembered that with Will , in the beginning , he had had to ask her if he was inside her , and in the very beginning there had not been time to ask . Very secretly , the most secret thought she ever had had , Emily was pleased that Grace had used a man when she wantedhim . But that thought was not to be an clement in Emily 's plans for Grace . It occurred to Emily that whatever Grace had done with Charlie Jay , she was likely to have done with Scotty Bordener , and there might even be someone else . Say three . Three who had touched116her , three whom she had touched . That had to stop , and the way to stop it was to know where Grace was at all times , to keep Grace from devoting her time to one young man , to keep changing her scenery . It was going to be difficult to know where Grace was at all times withoutarousing her suspicions , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The second part of her new plan was only a different version of her earlier strategy of discouraging young men who might compare too favorably with Sidney Tate , whom she trusted . The third part of her plan was another variant of the earlier scheme of devoted supervision of Grace 's social life . Emily Caldwell , an Episcopalian by membership , held the private opinion that churches got between the individual and God , and she was not at all sure that she did not regard Christ as part of the Church and therefore in the way . Her religion was between herself and God the Father , with whom she felt on good terms . She believed that God understood that what she did was for the best and that He understood and approved , even on those rare occasions when lesser ones might be critical . She also believed that when she lost her temper or acted untrue to form  --  the form which she and God understood  --  she was punished . In the present instance she believed that she had been punished for neglecting Grace by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned . In future she would look out for her daughter 's welfare more diligently , and for the present she thanked Cod for Sidney Tate . Now that Grace was " out "  --  Fort Penn acknowledged the fact while continuing to reject the term  --  she was often in the company of older young ladies and gentlemen , including the younger married set . She was the first girl in the history of Fort Penn to have a ball while still attending Miss Holbrook 's ; she was not yet eighteen and would not be until the twenty-ninth of April ; but it was no more than right that a Caldwell should be the one to establish the precedent . Everybody said it was no more than right . Everybody welcomed her , and not only as a Caldwell , but as a handsome , friendly girl , who was the picture of grace  --  one of a thousand puns on her name  --  on the ballroom floor , on the ice-covered river , at the piano , and everywhere she went . In Fort Penn there were skating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at someone 's house or the newly built country club ; there were Fort Penn balls , the Governor 's receptions , the Military Ball , sleigh-riding parties to Becksville , near the Caldwell farm ; small dinner parties , and trips to Philadelphia and New Yc'rk. 117Numerous trips to Philadelphia , where the cousins had done their family duty by sponsoring Grace , a not disagreeable task when a girl is handsome and rich . " You do n't think she 's overdoing it , do you ? " said Will to Emily . " No , I do n't . I want her to have a year she 'll always remember , " said Emily . There was one trip to White Sulphur Springs , which fitted into Emily 's plan for changing Grace 's scenery . The weather at The White was something short of heavenly , but Emily said she was just as well satisfied to have Grace take a rest . The rest worked out very well . By the time Emily was ready to return to Fort Penn the Baum Case had been disposed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second degree murder and was sentenced to twenty years to life . A few Italians muttered and complained , but their protests were heard only by other Italians and Roger Bannon , the politician , who shrugged his shoulders and said , " Well , you know what I been telling you good people . You ca n't fight them Dutch bastards if you do n't all take out your papers . Live right and vote right , that 's what I 'm all the time telling you to do . But you ca n't vote till you get your citizenship . Not here , not in this Dutch-infested ass-hole of the na- tion . They watch me like the devil watches an underpaid bank clerk . " " It was not a Dutchman that got him off , " said one of the Italians . " Of course it was n't ! Do you think I do n't know that ? It was an Irishman ! That 's what I 'm all the time telling you . Desmond O'Con- nelI , an Irishman , not one of their own thick-headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do indeed . But I do n't blame them for being so aware of their own shortcomings that they have sense enough to get an Irishman , a smart , brilliant , clever counselor . Do you see what I 'm leading to , Bongiorno ? " " Not quite . " " Then pardon me if I wax immodest , dear boy . I can do the same for the Italian that our friend O'Connell does for the beer-bellies . When they want something they have to go to an Irishman . Why should n't you avail yourself of the same opportunity ? Your friend Roger Bannon is no lawyer , but an enormous lot gets accomplished outside of the courts of law . I repeat , for the ten thousandth time , get your papers , become voters , and I 'll see to it that no Italian travels steerage . We 'll all ride first class and maybe even be waited on by the present owners of the boat , if you see what I mean . " " Yes . " 118 " The trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave from morn till night on the navvy gang , workin ' on the borough , doingthis for the Pennsy and that for the Nesquie , getting no higher than engine-wiper  --  and satisfied ! Satisfied to take the guff of the big lads and abuse your bodies till you 're wracked by consumption and spitting blood on your pillows at night . For what ? For the little money , the eight hundred dollars , the two thousand that will enable you to go back to the old country and buy a farm , and bring up your children to slave again on your few acres in Italy . Well , I was born in the old country too , but if one of my kids said he wished he could go back to Ireland and live , I 'd half-drown him . When the time comes , my eldest goes to college , if I have to steal the money . You know him . Roger Bannon , Junior . A boy of fourteen now , but already as big as his father . I let him have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's reached his growth . I 'll do without the pennies he could earn now and wait till he 's educated and strong and bringing in the dollars . The same with his brothers . They do n't entertain any thoughts of a little farm in Wexford , where I come from . I 'd like to see more of that kind of thinking from you people . Then we 'd get somewhere . " The Italians nodded dreamily , never questioning the reference to beer-bellies by the owner of Bannon 's Cafe ; never protesting that Roger Junior had acquired a paper route by using his fists on an Italian boy . They accepted these facts because Roger Bannon was the only non-Italian who ever showed the slightest interest in them . An eighteenth-birthday party in Fort Penn would have been an anti-climax , Emily Caldwell felt , after Grace 's large and successful ball ; and it better suited her immediate and long-term plans to take Grace to New York in April . A week was the longest period Grace ever had passed in New York , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big city , with its shops and theaters and people , offered forms of entertainment that had not commanded her attention on previous visits , and Emily got up a schedule for a two-week visit that Grace would enjoy . In New York the Caldwell and Brock families had no relatives who could be depended upon for dutiful sponsorship of a country cousin , but money like the Caldwell money  --  clean money and in quantity  --  has connections of its own . The Nesquehela . Fort Penn &; Lebanon railroad was on friendly terms with the Reading , and the Reading was on even friendlier terms with the House of Morgan , and while it was whispered that the Morgan119iiname alone was not enough to guarantee a man 's admission to a club , it was socially helpful to appear under Morgan auspices . George Langways , although not a Morgan partner , was close enough to the House and close enough to Will Caldwell to be influential and consideratewhen Will Caldwell , in a postscript to a business letter , asked George to look in on Emily and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , did not wait to look in . George 's wife immediately offered the comforts of her home , and insisted that all her life she had been eager to give a dinner party for Emily and now Emily and Grace . The invitation to stay at the Langways ' house was delicately declined , but Emily responded graciously to the idea of the dinner party , knowing that Maysie Langways would have her party early in the fortnightand that it would lead to other invitations . Maysie would have the Beaumonts and the Otises , acquaintances of the Caldwells , who could be depended upon , and for Grace there would be some younggentlemen . Maysie called on Emily the day she and Grace arrived at theKnickerbocker . " Yes , I did think of someone , " said Emily . " Do you happen toknow Sidney ' Tate ? " " Why , of course . We 've been to their house dozens of times , Alfred and Anna Tate . Sidney and Alan  --  our youngest son , I think he 's always been at school when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Does Grace ride ? " " Yes , that 's one of her accomplishments . " " I almost asked Sidney before you said anything . Is he a  --  is he abeau ? " " Oh , no , but he has been to our house , when he was visiting Yalefriends . " " I could put him next to Grace . " " Oh , do n't do that . Just so there 's one familiar face about her ownage . That is , not our age . " " I think you 're right . And if Sidney ca n't come for dinner he canalways come in later . That 's how we 'll leave it . " " Yes , you know how it is , Maysie , this is all new to Grace . " At that point Grace returned from the first shopping expeditionshe ever had gone on alone . " Oh , I do n't think we 'll have to worry about this young lady , " said Maysie . " She 'll have New York at herfeet . " Sidney came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night had to be withdrawn , but he withdrew it . He was not able12oto get Grace alone for a minute , but he had less difficulty monopolizingthe company of Emily , possibly because Emily placed herself at his disposal at least long enough to tell him what Note ! they werestopping at , and how long they were going to be in New York , and how nice it would be if he could have tea with them while they were in New York . He in turn reminded Emily that since he had been a guest in the Caldwell home , it was quite in order for Emily and her daughter to come to dinner chez Tate . An evening was decided upon , and Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Tate had their first look at the girl who they hoped was to be the one to make their boy happy . There were no other young people at the Tates ' dinner ; Mrs. Tate had wangled an invitation to a dance at someone 's house nearby . An impressive number of young gentlemen demanded introductions to Grace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of the pleasureof the girl whom he admittedly loved . He went in to see his mother , who was having breakfast in bed the morning after her dinner party . " Hmm , smells good , that coffee , " he said . " You get fresh coffee , and I only get Father 's warmed up . " " Pray help yourself to a cup of fresh coffee . The only reason youcame to call on me this morning . Pray do have a cup of fresh coffee , Sidney . Dear me . Poor boy . " " Not poor boy . I merely commented that  --  " " This coffee is no better than the coffee you had . You had Father'swarmed-over coffee , but I have your warmed-over coffee . Youcame in to ask me what I thought of Grace . Exquisite . Not only in face and form , but the way she handles herself . Such dignity for a girl her age . She is quite young . " " She 'll be eighteen in a week or two . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point , " said Anna Tate . " She looks like her mother . Does she look anything like her father ? " " Yes , the forehead and the softening around the mouth . But she does look more like her mother than her father . " " I 'm glad she does n't look entirely like her mother . Oh , Mrs.Caldwell 's a handsome woman , but I would n't like to think you were marrying her exact replica . " " Who said anything about marriage ? " " Oh , you did n't come in here to practice deception on your old mother surely . . . . Apparently they 're people of considerable means and position in Pennsylvania . Well , I 'll be frank and open with you . If you want to marry her , I have no objection . I think it 's almost time121you married and I do n't suppose I 'll ever really know any more about Grace than I do this minute . As to your father , I 'll even relieve your mind on that score . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's  --  well , he 's pleased . He even liked Mrs. Caldwell , and I did n't , of course . " " Why of course ' ? " " Sidney , you were always a very level-headed boy , with sound judgment about other people and about yourself , but since you 've met this girl you 've assumed a modesty , a self- is the word deprecia-tion ? " " Deprecation . " " Whatever . I have n't liked it one bit . It 's an insincere pose , that 's what it is , and I want you to stop it . " " What 's this got to do with Mrs. Caldwell ? " " Hold your horses , " said his mother . " Let me just tell you that you 're a very , very eligible young man , and nobody knows that better than Mrs. William Caldwell of Pennsylvania . I know it is n't she you love , but Grace . But keep your wits about you and your self-respect , and do n't go into this marriage thinking you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have good blood , you 're hardly a poor boy , and you have a nice way with people , kindness and consideration , and you 're intelligent . You 'll make a good husband and father . Oh , no . You 're not all getting and none giving . And down deep you know it . " " I suppose I do , or I would n't be putting my name up  --  " " Uh-uh . This is n't a horse race , Sidney . This is a marriage . This is the woman you live with and die with . " " I hope it is . " " " I hope it is too . " The conversation thus ended without Anna Tate 's having to expatiateupon her opinion of Emily Caldwell . The discussion was not reopened , ever . In their social intercourse the mothers acquitted themselves in ladylike fashion , with mutual respect and tacit antagonism , each understanding the other , knowing that she was understood . They seemed to agree , almost as if they had conferred , that the marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of a truce . Emily conceded that Sidney 's mother had gained a momentary advantageby her acute realization of what Emily was up to , and Emily knew that Anna still had time  --  the big past and the immediate present  --  onher side and could have prevented the marriage in the two weeks of the Caldwells ' New York stay . On the other side , Anna122realized that Emily would gain an advantage the moment she took Grace home . Once Grace was out of New York , with the courtship continuing , Sidney was , so to speak , lost , and Emily would assume the power to influence Grace against Sidney , which would make for Sidney 's unhappiness , possibly for the rest of his life . Mother Tate wanted her son to be happy , and Mother Caldwell wanted her daughtersecurely married . The ladies to all purposes achieved a rapprochementby keeping their distance . Emily Caldwell cheated a little bit , but she had a reason : Jessie Jay 's outburst , that not even Grace knew she knew . She refused Grace permission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Yale-Princeton baseball game , on the strictly conventional ground that Sidney and Grace were not engaged to be married , but her real reason was that it was up to Sidney to make the trip to Fort Penn and thereby publicly confess that Grace meant that much to him ; and while he was in Fort Penn he would be placing himself underthe supervision of Emily . On Grace 's birthday Emily had given a dinner party in a private dining-room of the Knickerbocker in return for those who had given parties in compliment to her and Grace . The birthday was not mentioned in the invitations , and Sidney was the only guest who had brought a present . He had guessed correctly that Mr. and Mrs. Caldwellwould give Grace something in the diamond line . He gave her a set of three gold pins : a miniature hunting crop for her stock , an oar to be worn on the river , and a tennis racquet with a pearl for a ball . In contrast with her parents ' diamond pendant his gifts appearedsuitably inexpensive , but the pearl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was a bold gesture on his part . It meant , and it was inferred to mean , that he was taking himself out of the casual admirer class . When they returned to Fort Penn Emily noticedthat Grace was never without one of the pins . At first she thought Grace wore the pins only on the appropriate occasions , but she discovered that even when Grace was in an evening gown one of the pins was hidden somewhere about her person , usually under a flounce , but at least once pinned to her stocking garter . " You never know when a pin will come in handy , " said Emily , when she saw the oar on the garter . " Oh , you noticed it . Well , I wear it because Sidney gave it to me . " " You like him the best ? " " I like him the only . " 123 " Yes , he 's very nice . I think so too . " " If I were older I 'd marry him , if he 'd ask me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marriage is a very serious thing at anyage . " " I never thought it was n't , Mother , " she said . " I want to ask you something . " " Yes ? " " Please do n't you and Father make me graduate from Holbrook 's . It 's bad enough to keep going there , even the way I 've been staying out this year , but do n't you think it 's carrying it too far to make me put on a cap and gown and sit with those children ? I consider them children . " " What do you consider yourself ? " " I 'm eighteen . I can own property in some states . I consider my self a woman . " " All right . I 'll speak to Miss Holbrook . " " Oh , thank you . You ca n't realize how I hated the thought of sitting there  --  " " I think I can . What about your diploma ? " " Diploma ? What for ? What good 's a diploma ? I never expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . Or at least I am , as much as I have to be for the life I want to lead . " " What 's that ? " " I 've told you . Live on the farm . If a horse ever asks me a question in Latin I wo n't be able to answer him , will I ? " " Grace ! " Emily smiled . " A horse  --  Latin . " " Burt do you know what I 'll do if he does , Mother ? " " What ? " " I ' l give him a good kick in the ass . " " Grace ! Why I  --  what  --  " " See , Mother ? I belong on the farm , not in polite society . " She kissed her mother and , laughing , left her mother laughing . But when Grace was gone a minute Emily 's laughing stopped , as she re- membered that such language was not innocent vulgarity , not in Grace 's case . In July , when she went to Cape May , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she watched for another reason ; she was on the lookout for a sign or signs that Grace was missing Sidney . The sign came . " This year I 'll be glad to leave Cape May , " said Grace . " We could n't ask Sidney down here , but we can ask him to the farm . " He came to the farm for a week 's visit early in August . They were up at seven every morning , saddling their own horses , and covering the fields and timber before the heat of the day . In the afternoon they played tennis and swam in the dam , and in the evening they sat on the porch with Will and Emily until Will would announce that it was time to turn in , leaving Sidney and Grace alone for half an hourbut no more , as Grace had been instructed . The Caldwells had no other guests during Sidney 's visit , not even for meals ; Fort Penn wasnot taken into the family 's confidence concerning Sidney 's presence at the farm , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence . Fort Penn knew what train brought him to Fort Penn , andwhat train took him away . The Schoffstal family , who were the most likely casual callers , were at Eagles Mere , in Sullivan County , andnot due to return before the end of the month , a fact which both Emily and Grace bore in mind when they invited Sidney to the farm . All other Fort Penn friends respected the figuratively closed gate at the end of the lane . " The week 's gone so fast , the happiest I 've ever had . You know I love you , Grace , do n't you ? " " It was my happiest week , too . " " And you know I love you . " " Yes , I think so , Sidney . " " When I go to Fort Penn tomorrow , on my way to the train I 'm going to stop and speak to your father , " he said . " Shall I ? I shouldhave asked you that first , but I have your permission , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think he 'll say ? " " I do n't know , Sidney . What are you going to say to him ? " " I 'm going to tell him that I 'm going to ask you to marry me . " " I think he 'll say it 's all right . IIe 's stopped making remarks about how young I am , so I guess he thinks I 'm old enough to be engaged . " " I 've never loved anyone but you , so I ca n't say I love you more than anyone else . Do you love me ? " " Yes . " " What ? " " I love you , Sidney . " They had been conversing quietly , as though their speeches showed the calmness of their relationship , but suddenly , when she said she loved him , Grace kissed Sidney on the mouth and opened her mouth and put her arms around him at the waist . If he had not been so surprised Sidney could have had herthen , that minute , but when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't let me kiss you like that , Sidney ! Do n't ! Get away from me , do n't let me touch you . I must n't feel this way . " Ile moved away from her and she turned her back until she was in control of herself . " Is n't it awful ? " she said . She smiled faintly . " I do n't know what happened to me . " " It 's all right , darling . It 's all right . You 're supposed to feel that way . " " Is that the way I 'm supposed to feel ? " " Of course . " " I thought not till you were married . " " You ca n't control how you feel . " " But we must . I must , rather , " she said . " Oh , I do n't know what came over me . " " I do . We 're in love . " " And that 's what happens ? " " Yes . " Sidney had his talk with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise to me , Sidney , and surprise or no surprise , I ca n't say I 'm displeased . You go ahead , and I hope she says yes  --  if she has n't already , eh there , boy ? " " No , sir . I have n't actually asked her , but I 'll be candid . It wo n't entirely surprise me if she says yes . We 've talked about it . " " Of course you have . Well , when you do ask her , and when she says yes , then you can tell her that she has my permission to marry you . That 'll save you another visit with me . Oh , we like you . You know that . I 'm just thinking of when I became engaged to Grace 's mother . These , uh , conferences with the prospective father-in-law , they can make a young fellow damned uncomfortable . " " Thank you , sir . " " But there is one thing we have to have a meeting about . You and I. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like this , but I know it 's extremely important to Grace . " " Anything Grace wants . " " Now , now , now . Do n't , do n't . Let me state it first . It has to do with your pride . " Will looked out the window . " If and when you and Grace are married , I want you to live on the farm . Now hear me out , please . I 've thought this over . I 've considered giving her the farm as a wedding present , but whether she gets it as a wedding present or through inheritance , the farm 's going to be hers . The house in town is going to be Brock 's . Now then , it may hurt your pride a little , not to be allowed to provide a home of your own , but I tell you this is126very important to Grace 's happiness . I think she 'd go anywhere with you , anywhere in the world , but all her life that 's been her home , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out now , Sidney , instead of later when you want to announce your engagement . For all practical purposes , the farm belongs to Grace , and when I die she 'll have a considerableincome , and when her mother dies there 'll be more . Now this is what I would suggest as a way you could handle the problem . If you can carry it , I suggest that you pay your joint living expenses , and the general support of your wife , precisely as you would if you went to live in New York or anywhere else , and when you have children , they 're also your financial responsibility . You 're an only child , and I presume the sole heir , so later on  --  oh , and I almost did n't mention that you 've always wanted a farm , so later on you can work out something with Grace to buy the farm from her , if you care to . But for the immediate future , Sidney , I think I 'd almost make it a condition of my , uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , or assurance , that for the first two years you 'll live on the farm . " " I give you my word right now . " " Well , think it over . It 'll mean you 'll have your mother-in-law and father-in-law for company a great deal oftener than if you lived elsewhere , but we 're not going to last forever , and the truth is , now that I no longer ride horseback and the dam is too cold for me to swim in , the farm is n't the treat it used to be . I 'm retiring in a year or two and Mrs. Caldwell and I expect to spend more time away from Fort Penn . For instance I 've always had a hankering , I s'pose you 'd call it , to see China , and now that we 're more welcome there , or at least safer , I might take a trip and see the place . And South Africa . Be safe to visit there in a year or two , I should think . Well , meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch . Good luck , my boy , and tentatively , at any rate , I welcome you into the fold . " Sidney again visited the farm for the Labor Day week-end , or what was called the Labor Day week-end in most states . In Pennsylvaniait was then the first Saturday in September , and owing to a great strike of anthracite miners there was some sympathetic unrest among the working people of Fort Penn . On the Monday the Caldwellshad a few friends for dinner . Will Caldwell made a little speech : " Dear friends , I have an announcement to make that may or may not come as a surprise to you , but surprise or otherwise , I think you 'll all be as pleased as Emily and I are that this afternoon Sidney Tate asked for the hand of our daughter Grace , and , quite obviously , if you 'll glance at them both , we have given our consent . I therefore127propose a toast . . . " Will acquitted himself very well , quite as though he had not been informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brick through a curved glass in the house on Second Street . The announcement was not made official until October , which gave Connie Schoffstal time to arrange the large luncheon at which the announcement was made , and Grace by that time had her ring . Between October and June Sidney made the trip from New York to Fort Penn at least once every two weeks , and the respective parents paid official calls at the respective homes . So long as they remained unmarried they were the outstanding engaged couple in Fort Penn , at least , and they put on weight from the rich food that was served by hostesses trying to outdo one another . Sidney and Grace after the first few months of their engagement arrived at a method of mutual satisfaction of their passion , but they postponed ultimate consummationuntil their wedding night . The wedding was conceded to be the biggest thing of its kind ever held in Fort Penn . Everybody agreed on that , from the very small group who actually witnessed the ceremony to the thousands who knew all about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he unique . Grace 's wedding started being unique with the invitations : the important weddings in Fort Penn always had followed the system of taking care of the sheep and the goats by inviting the personsof goat status to the church but not to the reception . Grace adamantly refused to be married in Fort Penn . She told her mother that she had decided to be married at the little church in Becksville and that the reception would take place at the farm . The church could seat only eighty persons , and consequently cards to the church were the more highly prized tokens of Caldwell esteem . Not even the Governor of the state was invited to the church , although he was invited to , and attended , the reception . A compromise had to be effectedso that an Episcopal clergyman could officiate in the Becksville church , which was Lutheran . The compromise was effected and the church thereby acquired its first pipe organ . It had been rumored that Fort Penn was to witness its first " motorized " wedding : that Grace was importing automobiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farm . Nothing could have been further from the truth . " If I see one automobile I 'll tell them to go away , " said Grace . A special train , of locomotive and five coaches , shuttled back and forth between the Fort Penn station of the N. F. P. &; L. and the farm , which was not a regularly scheduled stopon the line , but which had a small shed at which trains stopped on signal from the conductor . The old Becksville  --  Fort Penn two-horse stage , idle a dozen years , was found to be in fair condition in the trolley-car barn . It was repainted and greased , and put into service to take infirm guests from the train to the Caldwell lawn , where the receptionwas held . In ignorance of Grace 's threat a score of motor cars reached the farm , and a ferry service was instituted for the convenienceof guests who lived on the eastern shore of the river , who might otherwise have had to travel a considerable distance to cross by bridge . Five mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tents was for the use of the bridal party and immediate family ( the other guests ate under the sky , but as someone said , it was Caldwell weather ) . A second tent was for the hot plate and other foods , a third tent was for the champagne , whiskey and punch bars , a fourth tent served ice cream , other desserts and coffee , and the fifth tent was pitched to the east of the house , a good distance from the lawn and out of sight of the guests . It was reserved for ladies and small children . The gentlemen were directed to the stable . Professor I-Ierman Schoffstal , who played the pipe organ at the church ( it had been installed in time for the ceremony ) , also conducted the orchestraon the lawn . He had eight violins , two violas , two cellos , one bass viol , two harps , two flutes ( one flautist and one harpist were ladies ) , and piano . After they were made as one the bride and groom stepped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and serpentines . In honor of the occasion Higgins , the coachman , and his son had been fitted out in silk hats with cockades , black whipcord tailcoats , white doeskin breeches , and hunting-style boots , and they wore starched stocks . Prince and Duke , Emily Caldwell 's chestnut cobs , were used , and they were in the silver-mounted harness , the set which was erroneouslybelieved to have solid silver names . The happy couple , followed by the bridal party in equally smart turnouts , proceeded to the Caldwell house . There Grace was taken by her husband to Will Caldwell 's den , and in the presence of those ushers who were membersof the Yale secret society called Death 's Head , she was initiated with the brief ceremony reserved for all brides of Death 's Head men . This solemn ritual concluded according to the rubrics , the bride and groom were permitted to continue with the schedule , which allowed fifteen minutes for bride , maid of honor , bridesmaids , bridegroom , best man , and ushers to empty their bladders , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tents until Sally Wall , a bridesmaid , keeled over in a faint , and two more bridesmaids appeared to be about to follow suit . At that point some six hundred men , women , and children had observed the amenities , but at least two hundred more were deprived of the pleasure of shaking hands with the ladies and gentlemen on the receiving line . For the first time in four strenuoushours ( except for her rides in the victoria and her visit to the bathroom ) Grace sat down , at the U-shaped table . The primary toasts were drunk and then Sidney and Grace took to the tennis court , now boarded over for dancing , and Professor Schoffstal , who had been providing subdued renditions of Mendelssohn and the like , struck up some Strauss , beginning with An der Schonen Blauen . The sterner Methodists turned their backs while the Episcopalians , Presbyterians , Lutherans , Reformeds , Baptists and Catholics partook of the dancing mood . Emily Caldwell danced the first dance with AlfredTate , the second with Sidney , the third with Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Governor , a handsomefigure in his frock coat , but not the mould of form on the ballroomfloor , thought he heard Emily muttering words that sounded like " damn you . " " Mrs. Caldwell , " he said , " my dancing is n't all it should be , but did I hear you say , damn you ' ? " They laughed together as she made a convincing denial , which was somewhat the more difficult because she had said " Damn you , " but not as a criticism of the Governor 's dancing . She had seen Charlie Jay on his way to the bridal party 's tent , and her complete thought had been : " We 're safe from you now , damn you . " Jessie Jay had regretted the invitation to the reception , but she had sent some wedding present or other . The presents were on view in the hall , the dining-room , the sitting-room , and the library of the big house . They were being guarded by three Pinkerton men disguised as waiters and Chief Lengel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be disguised as AdmiralDewey , had evoked recollections of the hero of the recent war because of a resemblance one to the other , or possibly because the chief 's cap and moustache looked like the admiral 's . In his uniform Chief Lengel was a reminder to the guests that they were looking upon articles of great value , in case there was ' a single person more than ten years old who was so stupid as to need a reminder . Upstairs , in the wall safe in her mother 's bedroom Grace had stashed the pearl necklace Emily had given her , the diamond bracelet from Mr. and Mrs. Tate , the diamond-and-ruby ring from her father , and the **26;4572;TOOLONG from the Schoffstal family . But on the130linen-covered tables along the walls downstairs  --  " A man could easily retire on what 's here , " said Chief Lengel to one of the Pinks . In the sterling and Sheffield line there was enough to furnish a small , expensivehotel , what with the chests of flat silver , roast platters , butter dishes , tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trays , coffee services , samovars ( in the event Grace decided to have a Russian-type cozy corner ) , cigar boxes , cigarette boxes ( of which one was engraved with the signatures of Sidney 's best man and ushers ) , candelabra , pairs of candle holders , candle snuffers , salvers , salt-andpeppershakers , pepper mills , cup-holder and saucer sets , decanters , demi-tasse spoons , cake knives , spatulas , ash receivers , matchboxes , punch bowls , tureens , bon-bon dishes , tea canisters and infusers , matching and unmatching sugar bowls and cream pitchers , coasters , water pitchers , chafing dishes , statuettes , inkstands , complete desk sets , flasks ( for the saddle ) , bells , and the Death 's Head loving cup ( one to every Death 's Head bride ) . " I ca n't help thinking of that William J. Bryan , " said Chief Lengel to the Pink . The golden articles were easier to keep an eye on ; they occupied a smaller space . There was a gold inkstand , a gold pen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stamp box , powder box , candlestick for sealing-wax , paperweight in the form of a cannon , demi-tasse spoons , snuff box , napkin rings , miniature picture frames , and a nugget from the Klondike mounted on a wooden base . The guards paid little attention to the treasures in one of the rooms . The names Spode , Stiegel , Sevres , Lowestoft , Wedgwood , and Chi'en Lun signified nothing to Chief Lengel and the Pinks , and the only reason they went in that room at all was that they did n't want anything broken while they were on duty . Nobody would steal that stuff . In this room there were numerous bon-bon dishes which had been hand-painted . Women and girls all over the country spoke of their " painting , " their " taking up painting , " and their " giving up painting . " By painting they meant decorating dishes and pitchers with gilt bands and , in this case , the script initials G. C. T. These art works had been the cause of great concern on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary a couple of months before the wedding invitations were to be sent out . Miss Holbrookearned every cent of the five-hundred-dollar honorarium which was paid her . The invitation list was her first task , involving not only Grace 's relatives , friends , and acquaintances , but Sidney 's as well , which in turn required two trips to New York for consultation with Sidney 's mother . Miss Holbrook got the most help from Nicholas131Bonniwell , of Kemp &; Bonniwell , the Tiffany &; Company of Fort Penn . A delicate situation had been created by the Caldwells ' decision to have the invitations engraved by the actual Tiffany , the New York Tiffany , but Miss Holbrook reminded Mr. Bonniwell that Kemp &; Bonniwell had been selected to do the invitations for Grace 's ball , and they could n't expect everything , and moreover , most of the wedding presents would be bought at Kemp &; Bonniwell 's , Fort Penn 's fashionable jewelers . Nicholas Bonniwell saw the light and turned over his mailing list to Miss Holbrook , and did not even mention the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Schmidt &; Burke . The Bonniwell list , the roster of members of the Fort Penn Club , a judicious study of the telephone directory , and scraps of paper which Emily Caldwell handed Miss Holbrook from time to time made up the Fort Penn part of the list . When it came to making a list of the wedding presents and their donors Miss Holbrook had more trouble ; a tree-of-life roast platter had been sent by the President of the United States and Mrs. Roosevelt ( they were friends of the Tate family ) and duplicates had been sent by five other parties , but the hand-painted bon-bon dishes were the challenge to Miss Holbrook . There was nothing to do but measureeach one and write a full description of it so that Grace could identify it when she wrote her thank-you notes . " Just think , " said Grace to Sidney , a day or so before the wedding . " I 'll have to write a letter for each and every one of these things . But some day I 'll be able to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the linen and fancywork line the place of honor was given to the doilies which had been crocheted by the women backstairs , the bedspread embroidered by Julie , the cook , and the hemstitched napkinsby Amelia Rcifsnyder , wife of the farmer . The bride and groom received individual gifts from Iliggins . Grace 's was a set of handplaitedreins : " It 's years since I put me hand to this kind of work , and they look rather Western , but they 'll do for hacking on the farm , " said Higgins . His gift to Sidney was a thin little whip : " I carriedthis the last race I ever rode at the Fair Grounds , Mr. Tate , and I hope it 'll bring you the same luck . I won . " At a few minutes before seven the bride and groom disappeared from the party . The cry went up , " Where they going ? Where they going ? Does anybody know where they 're going on their honeymoon ? " Connie Schoffstal caught the bride 's bouquet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy couple 's destination , although in truth she knew no better than anyone else . The dance floor132and the tables were deserted at the cry of " I-Iere they come  --  there they go , " and Grace and Sidney were driven away in a brougham , with Higgins on the box and one of the cobs in the shafts . They were taken only to the end of the lane , and there they changed to a dogcartand Beauty , Brock Caldwell 's fast trotter , which was being held by young Neal Higgins . They drove to Fort Penn station , where their luggage was waiting , and took the evening train to Sunbury , about forty miles away . They had agreed not to spend their wedding night on a Pullman , but to go to the Sunbury hotel for the night and the next day board the Buffalo express , which would enable them to spend their second night in Niagara Falls . " I 've hardly seen you , all afternoon , and yet I know you 're the loveliest thing that ever drew breath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one I wanted to look nice for , and he did n't see me . " " I saw you . I 'd have seen you if I 'd been blind . This is the way I 'll always remember you . " The proprietor of the hotel was expecting them . He and a boy carried their bags to the parlor , bedroom and bath on the second floor . " Mr. Reichelderfer said we should n't wait supper but we did . There 's the pork chops if you want them , on the regular dinner , but maybe you 'll like better the roast chicken we roasted special . You can have it up here . You do n't have to go clown the dining-room . " The man and the boy , his son , brought the meal and some ice for the bottle of champagne in Sidney 's Gladstone .. " When you 're done just put the dirty dishes outside in the hall and somebody 'll get them . Good night , all . " " I 'm hungry , are you ? " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starved . " " I like our quarters , very much . " " I do too , " she said . " And I like that man . he did n't treat us like  --  what we are . Hon-eymooners . " " The little boy stared .

" " Still , I suppose he 's better than the usual hotel bellboy . I 've always hated hotel bellboys , I do n't know why . I know why ! " " Why ? " " I can tell you . I never told anyone else . I hate them because when they carry your bags upstairs they go right into your bedroom with you . See what I mean ?

" " Oh , are we still in Pennsylvania Dutch-land ? " " Not like Fort Penn , but this man 's Pennsylvania Dutch . Did n't you hear him talk ? I 'm glad you brought this champagne . It 's my favorite drink . Here 's to you , my husband . " " And to you , my wife . " They drank and then she stood up . " I 'm not hungry any more . Sidney . " " I 'm not either , really .

She was in bed , and the only light was coming from the bathroom . " Oh , " he said . " What ? " " I guess I 'll undress in the parlor . " He undressed and put on his pajamas and dressing-gown and walked through the bedroom to the bath . He came out again wearing the pajamas and gown . " What do you think about the light ? " " I do n't know , " she said . " Just the bathroom light ? Could we have that ? " " Yes . Whatever you want . " " I 've never seen you . " " I 've never seen you , either . " She suddenly threw off the bedclothing . " Here I am , " she said . He had been thinking she had on a nightgown , but he was wrong . " Just let me look , a little while . " In a very little while she began to squirm under his gaze . " I 'm looking at your face , Sidney . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now close the door . " He did so and got into the bed , and the moment he touched her the rage began . " Do everything ! Kiss me ? Kiss me here ? Let me  --  no . No ! Go in me . Quickly , Sidney , 134please . I 'm going , I 'm going . Do n't do anything else , go in me . Ohyou 're in me and I 'm all around you , just in time , time , time . Oh , such wonderful , exquisite . " " Yes , yes . Dear Grace . Did it hurt ? " " No . " " Not at all ? " " No . " " That 's good . I never want to hurt you . " " Sidney . " " Yes , darling . " " Are you happier now ? " " Oh , Grace , I 've never been so happy . " " I do n't mean just happy . " " Yes . " " I am too . You know , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . " " Do n't look , Sidney . I have to get up and go to the bathroom . " He obeyed her ; he did not look . He heard the water running in the tub . " To think of lying with you all night , " she said , when she came back . " Yes . " " If you want to touch me , all you have to do is touch me . " " Yes . " " Oh , what people do n't know that have only kissing , and playing with each other . Think of being able to lie here together . " " Yes . " " And from now on , every night , " she said . The pace of her speeches was slowing down , as though she were talking herself to sleep . He had his right arm under her neck , his lefthand holding her right hand . Her breathing became deep and regular and she fell sound asleep . For a few minutes he thought protective thoughts and grateful thoughts . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy and wide awake . He slid his hand away from hers and caressed her breasts until the nipples hardened and  --  though the rhythm of her breathing was not disturbed  --  she reached for him and found him , caressed him , and this time it was as though years had passed since their first time , or as though she had learned andgrown in her sleep . The second time made the first time forgotten ; like a mistake to be disremembered . It was dark now ; no light fromthe bathroom ; and she was not the untried bride in the veil and lace , 135no more than he was the bowing , properly self-effacing bridegroom of the church and the reception . He was not shocked by the words she knew or her directions , because he was not sure that the words she was speaking were not words he was uttering himself . At the ap- proach of the climax she began calling to him , and after they reached it together he could have no doubt of the fact . Her words were gently spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way until he was sure she wanted him to move , and then he lay beside her without her pro- testing . " Do you know how I feel ? " he said . " Tell me , " she said . " I feel as though we 'd built something great . " " I hope it was n't a baby , " she laughed . He laughed . " Grace , you know you shock me . " " I suppose I do , " she said . " Do you know why I 'm sure I do ? " " Vhy ? " " Because nothing you do shocks me , and nothing I do shocks me . But you ! Ah , Sidney , poor Sidney . Nobody 'll ever know you married a had woman . But you 're bad , too . I do n't consider you a little choir- boy with rosy cheeks . Oh , I 'm glad you married me . " In other years he often would think of what they had said that night , and of what they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reception , aside from six or seven cindered eyes on the special train ; Isaac Schoffstal 's attack of acute indigestion , which was relieved with some Arm &; Hammer baking soda ; a McKelvie girl 's finger , which was pinched in the Cald- wells ' kitchen screendoor when she went looking for salt to take out a stain on her dress ; the back of Mrs. Fred Bauer 's neck , slightly burned when grazed by a cigar in the hand of Walter Buchwalter ; Agnes Martindale 's left little toe , bruised , and a day later discovered to be broken , by Paul Reichelderfer 's walking on it ; Philip S. Hamil- ton 's right car , stung by a wasp in the Caldwell barn . Two days after the wedding the last of the out-of-town guests had gone home and the citizens of Fort Penn began looking forward to the Fourth of July , but in their hearts they knew that the Fourth , while it offered firecrackers and baseball games and the annual big doings on the river , was not going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement of private cars from New York , the fashionable strangers in the hotels , the lines of carriages at the pre- wedding parties , the last-minute hustle and bustle in the stores , the savage curses of the people who had not been invited , the unbearable hauteur of those who had been invited to the church , the spending , the tips , the curiosity and conjecture over Sidney Tate , Shoptown 's speculation on Grace 's chastity , the angry disappointment when Grace chose to be married in the remoteness of the country . Said Sentinel Editor Arthur James Hollister : " It all comes down to this : if the telegraph wire said a thousand people had been killed in an earthquakein Chile , the important news in Fort Penn would still be that a rich and beautiful young girl was going to go to bed with a handsome , more or less unknown city slicker . It 's regrettable , out of proportion , but it 's true . Or , God damn it , is it regrettable ? Come to think of it , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in the earthquake and a thousand people killed , I 'd quit the newspaper business , or at any rate I 'd get out of Fort Penn . " At an indeterminate point in their lives Sidney and Grace became the Tates . Someone said to someone else , " The Tates were there , " or " I stopped by the Tates ' , " or " I have n't seen the Tates . " Someone made some such statement , and the fact that the speaker made the statement was not nearly so significant as the fact of its acceptance by the person or persons who heard him . It was an indeterminate , uncleterminablepoint , but it was the right moment for the remark to be made and heard . At the moment the statement , in that form , was accepted , the marriage was established . People would go on saying , " Sidneyand Grace were there , " and " I stopped by Grace 's , " and " I have n't seen Sidney and Grace " ; but the other form  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more permanent than " Sidney and Grace " had been . After a while the new form was more acceptable , had more of an intimacy about it , than " Sidney and Grace . " The climbers , the not-yet-arrived , the remote-but-acquainted might speak of " Sidney and Grace " and snobbishly feel in so doing that they had proclaimed a close relationship . They were wrong . Once the Tates had been called the Tates , and the form had been adopted , " Sidney and Grace " lost its value as a sign of constant and relaxed friendship with the persons named . There was a simple reason that this was so : a genuine intimate of Sidney 's and Grace 's called them the Tates because there was something rough-and-ready about calling them the Tates that did not obtain otherwise . In calling them the Tates a woman or a man was proving that he was their equal . A man might say , " Katharine and I are playing tennis with Sidney and136 137Grace , " and reveal nothing more than that he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best mixed doubles team in Fort Penn . If however his wife said , " We 're getting up a picnic : the Walls , the Poffenbergers , the Tates , and the Cunninghams , " she not only announced that she was placing herself in a position to be stung by a bee from the same hive as the bee that might sting Grace , but that she regarded Grace and her husband as welcome and desirable companions , but no more so than the Poffenbergers , the Walls , or the Cunninghams . The difference in snobbism between those who said " the Tates " and those who said " Sidney and Grace " was slight and incalculable because there would have had to exist different standards of measure- ment . The " Sidney and Grace " people were strivers , and could not be gauged by the same rules that would be used on the secure , or " the Tates " people . Then there was the absence of a difference , the thing in common : it was the admission as made with many a direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were unique . " Now tell me why , " said a mythical stranger to a mythical but observant citizen of Fort Penn , " are Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Tate unique ? Go on , tell me . " " Well , first of all , their appearance , " replied the citizen . " You 've got to grant me that , right off the bat , they 're as good-looking a couple as you 'll find in a month of Sundays or , if you 're pressed for time , a day 's journey . She 's a handsome woman . We all knew she would be , even from a little girl . She had those eyes , you 'd say they were big eyes , big brown eyes . But they were n't big at all , you know . They were only average size eyes , and as a matter of fact , I 'll bet if you measured them and you found a deviation from average size , I would n't be one bit surprised if the deviation was on the small side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might call contra- diction : You 'd think to look at her  --  not only when she was a child , but when she was pretty grown up , and even today , as far as that goes  --  you 'd always think she was the kind of pensive , deep-thinking , brooding girl that was working out algebra problems in her head , or hearing music that she was getting ready to put clown on paper , such as the Berceuse from Jocelyn . But I happen to know she was never very good in school , in her lessons . She always got promoted , and I suppose she deserved to be as much as most of the girls that went to that Miss I-Iolbrook 's , but she never stood out as a student . Never took any prizes of any kind . And as to music , she can sit down and play a tune on the piano and if she has the music in front of her she wo n't hold you in suspense while she 's trying to find a chord . She could also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some Beethoven . Some Bach . Schumann . But as to composing anything , that was the farthest thing from her mind , if results mean anything . No , she mostly depended on having the music right there in front of her . You know , the piano she learned on , it was an upright and it had places to hold candles , candleholders , on either side of the piano . " " Never mind about the candleholders , please . I 'd rather learn some more about Grace . " " Very well , but you 'll pardon me if it 's my opinion that environmentis just as important as heredity , and a piano with candleholders was part of Grace 's environment . Do n't worry , I 'll say no more on the subject , but that 's my honest opinion . " " All right , you 've put that across , " said the stranger . " Now are you all finished with her eyes , how she appeared to be a brooding sort but did n't shine in her studies or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the citizen . " Except that with those broodingeyes she naturally was thought of as a Latin type , and the Latin type in this country we always associate with  --  well , Carmen . Emotional , tempestuous . But I never heard any of that sort of talk about Grace . For a while there she was n't even popular with the opposite sex . " " Perhaps they were afraid of her . " " That 's a possibility , but here in Fort Penn  --  I 'm just telling you what I know  --  never any talk about anything out of the way . And here 's a funny thing I just happened to think of : I 've known one or two cases where a young fellow 'd bet Grace had blue eyes . " " Well , of course that does n't necessarily mean anything . You 've heard of husbands that did n't know the color of their wives ' eyes . " " Yes , I 've heard of that , and I can believe it . I just put that in because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am . It 's worthy of some consideration , " said the stranger . " But go on , please . " " Well , that 's all on the question of her appearance , bearing in mind that she got better-looking all the time . And she married a handsome young fellow , so they make a handsome couple . " " That 's true , but it does n't make them unique . "
