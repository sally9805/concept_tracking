 | My husband and I told our youngest daughter that she could not join a high-school sorority . She took it with her chin up . But when she went to bed , there was a little-girl quiver on her lips . John and I do n't believe in saying " no . " Nor do we want Hazel to be disappointed in this new school life she is about to enter . We want her to have everything high school offers ? the good times , the normal boy-andgirl relationships , the feeling she is one of the crowd . We know that for her the most important business of life right now is to make new friends and to be accepted . The sorority question , however , is larger than the question of our daughter 's happiness . It concerns the hap- piness of other sons and daughters , who for lack of money or prestige , or from preference , do not become part of the fraternity system . It concerns a whole welter of democratic ideas . We have tried to be fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have watched the system change in temper and style and attitude during the past few years . And something is wrong with it , fundamentally wrong . While half the world fights for democracy , people who maintain exclusive little groups are simply outof-step . Our examination of the sorority system has convinced us that it results mainly in wasted money , unadulterated heartbreak , al organized unkindness . Take the situation in our hid school . There are 1,500 student but not more than 200 belong fraternities and sororities . Eat of the 1,500 students needs secure social life ? not just a Hazel , not just the 200 who , a taken into the fraternity systel To the adolescent in high schd the hunger for social approv is as strong and as mandate as hunger for food . The main argument for hid school sororities and fraterniti is that they provide social c ; portunities for the students . T : argument defeats itself . it very social opportunities provide for the favored few r. : a barrier between the " Ha-. and " Have-nots " ? a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have-nots . " If the happiness the frate : - :a system gives one person weighed against the unhapp:rre it causes so many others . td system is proved to be seriotly wanting . Indeed , the case against a rorities and fraternities can made by rhetoric alone . a John and I know of tragedy caused by the fraternity sys1 , that go beyond any power words . Only a year ago , as p probably remember , a school girl in an Eastern col community , brokenhearted becay her sorority did n't pledge sister , committed suicide . " independent " high-school for girl was invited by one of fraternity boys to a frate dance in our town . All thr high school she had nurs secret hurt because she had tl been asked to join a soro Her final humiliation came that party . No one except boy who brought her asked to dance . We remember the time daughter Patty came home a rushing meeting , white shaken , when one of her best fri was not bid . " I 've never known could be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get so perate , but many are deeply And sometimes the hurts cause long hatreds or deep-seated neurr patterns in their personalities . Maybe this builds character . do n't think it is fair to ask school boys and girls to develop characters that way . We des ; child-labor laws to prevent ch from being assigned to physical la dens beyond their years . Why do allow the sorority system to imp upon children an emotional bull they are not old enough to halal This is the @#  | picture outside the sorority . What goes on inside is not pleasant either ? girls telling each other off for the good of their souls , rivalry between groups , candidacy with its bullying . Pledges usually keep secret their humiliation during candidacy periods , for fear of losing face among the members . But I know that pledges once were brought into a sorority meeting one by one and purposely badgered until each was reduced to tears . The hazing in fraternities is eve n worse . Boys often are beaten brutal : .. One student was knocked unconscio- , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another suffered a serious spilt l injury and had to undergo a series ? operations , as the result of his fraterni ? : initiation . Sometimes pledges are driven miles into the country at night , the abandoned without shoes or money , t get home as best they can . Why this stupid activity ? In part it due to the immaturity of high-sche. students and to the mob spirit that san tions group actions none would do alon But most of the blame is to be laid the feet of parents who foster the syst because of the social advantages they lieve their children are gaining . Too many parents live in ignorance the real dangers inherent in fraterni : and sororities . Where is the supervise of these groups ? Not in the schools , ri of which have outlawed them . Not f alumnm , who tacitly accept the " boy pranks . " Not from parents , who hear what their children want them to . A short talk with a high-school pr pal will reveal what he thinks of the f ternity system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but divides school morale . High-school cl : and activities are supported halfhe edly , because they are second best . H : school politics are bossed by fraterni : because they are organized and beca it is n't " smart " to be an independent . WIRY , then , do n't parents do somethi WHY , are many reasons . First of many of them honestly do n't know n : ; about the system . They have n't g through it themselves , and they hav had experience with other children 's longing to sororities and fraternities . Another reason is harsh , but never less true . Some parents regard as a s honor their children 's bids to soro and fraternities . They seek the contacts " and prestige they believe system bestows . Still other parents , who have di ered the evils of the system , hesita embarrass their children by repo what they know . And there is a more deep-seated selfish reason for the parental refu assume responsibility . The how -- e look attitude . Parents whose children not belong to fraternities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sour grapes . " Parents whose chil do belong refuse to cast aspersion on system for fear it will reflect on th And so parents shut their eyes to danger sororities and fraternities are their children 's physical and emo : . well-being . They clutch at any f straw of good that the fraternity blows . One mother is glad her da belongs to a sorority because , she fur BUSY HANDS ! @#  | " They are so religious " ? the soro opens its meetings with the Lo Prayer . Another praises the philanthr of her daughter 's group . " Every Chr mas they take a basket to some p family , " she says . A third , who somew innocently confuses democracy with tronage , considers sororities democr , because they always elect an independ girl queen of one dance . The only valid comeback proponent ; the system can make is the challen What can you offer in exchange ? If sorority is taken away , something m be substituted . High-school dances not always a successful substitute . The average high-school boy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I waited for some boy to me , I 'd never get to a dance , " one Patty 's friends said . High-school bt and girls feel more secure in a gro The very lack of supervision in sororit and fraternities permits more freed in those first dates and dances . And t social training , learning to mix eas with the opposite sex , is a vital part the adolescent 's education ? like using i right fork and making introductions . Here again the solution can be fou only if parents will agree to assume larger responsibility for their children social life . Community organizations vi have to take the lead in sponsori dances for high-school students , danc that are open to everyone . Parer Teacher Associations can help the schc improve and enlarge its social program , THE high-school fraternity system far from indispensable ; but how can be abolished ? As long as parents refuse to face t problem squarely , they remain ti largest obstacle . But certain farsightt communities have dealt successfully wi it through their Boards of Educatio These Boards have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embody the following principles : 1 . No organization of high-school stt dents can be formed without the approv of the Principal of the school and tl Board of Education . 2 . Any student joining an unauthorinE group relating to high-school life ar choosing its members from high-who members shall be deprived of all scho offices , honors , and positions of authority 3 . A student may be required to Trial a declaration on his word of honor thI he is not affiliated with any unauthorize group , if the Principal deems it necessar ; High-school fraternities and sorority no longer can be ignored . The viciousnm and snobbery of the system are blitz marks on our otherwise democrats public-school life . To tolerate it longer i to deny to all our children of high-schoc age their right to free and open America social contact .
