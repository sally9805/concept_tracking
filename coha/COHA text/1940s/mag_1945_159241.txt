The White House had its " help wanted " sign out last week . The main reason : after years of silent but substantial service to two Presidents ( at $12,000 a year ) , round , amiable Lawyer Samuel Irving Rosenman , 49 , was finally making good his worn threat to leave Washington . <P> In 1932 , when he was a New York State Supreme Court Justice ( at $25,000 a year ) , Sam Rosenman had begun building the New Deal brain trust for his good friend Franklin Roosevelt . Later , he had had a hand in writing many an FDR speech . A shadowy figure , he had moved quietly in &; out of Washington , never staying long enough for political gossip to get a good start . <P> War brought him to Washington more often , and lengthened each visit . In 1941 Rosenman was called to reorganize the entire defense agency setup . Result : the Supply , Priorities &; Allocations Board . Later , Commuter Rosenman helped organize the War Manpower Commission . Next , the Governments ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running errands and writing speeches for the President , and advising him on the selection of candidates tor Government jobs , planned the Office of War Information . <P> At FDR 's death , Rosenman packed up for Manhattan and a private law practice ( possibly a partnership with ex-FEA attorney Oscar Cox ) . But someone had to help out Harry Truman . Resignedly , Rosenman briefed the new President on the Roosevelt work and policies , helped write Truman 's first message to Congress and his foreign-policy speech , was soon reported to be exercising more influence over Truman than he had over FDR . But Rosenman was not interested in influence . Also , Democrats were beginning to talk about that shadowy figure again . This time , " Sammy the Rose " said he was gone for good .
