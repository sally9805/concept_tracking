What ails Britain 's George VI ? All public engagements would be canceled " over a period of some months . " The official bulletins had been medically vague . But at week 's end it was learned that the King suffers from a variation of Buerger 's disease , * mostly affecting his right foot . Other more frightening names for it : presenile gangrene , thrombo-angiitis obliterans . <P> The trouble begins when inflammation in the arteries or veins slows or shuts down circulation of the blood ; ulcers develop-or , in severe cases , gangrene . The disease usually affects arteries near the body 's surface , more often in the legs than in the arms . The King also suffers from hardening of the arteries , a combination said by U.S. doctors to be fairly unusual . <P> The King 's illness , certainly not trivial , has been developing for many months , but he did not consult any of the palace doctors until about ten days before the birth of Princess Elizabeth 's son . First symptoms are usually tired legs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptoms for some time , but blamed too much walking or standing . On Nov. 6 he did a lot of cross-country walking while hunting at Windsor ; that night , after attending a British Legion Remembrance Festival , he complained that his right foot bothered him , but the next day he stood in the rain during a Remembrance Day service . Since he took over the throne his brother abdicated twelve years ago , the nervous , shy , self-effacing King has probably changed uniforms more often , shaken more hands , listened to more speeches , and laid more wreaths than any other chief of state in modern times . <P> The King 's doctors believe they have caught the illness at an early stage . He is up &; around Buckingham Palace every day , limping slightly but not using a cane or crutch ; usually he rests his foot on a pillow while working . Main medical treatment is described as an electric apparatus ( which stimulates circulation ) , fitted around the thigh . Other possible treatments : rest in bed if there is pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dilate the arteries ; a nerve-cutting operation . <P> The cause of Buerger 's disease is unknown . Many , but not all , patients are cigarette smokers ( smoking constricts the small arteries ) . The King 's doctors are reported to have ordered him to stop his heavy smoking . Most patients with Buerger 's disease also have acute or chronic epidermophytosis ( fungus diseases of the skin like washerwomen 's itch or athlete 's foot ) . The disease occurs most frequently between the ages of 20 and 45 ( the King will be 53 Dec. 14 ) . Doctors do not know why , but men victims outnumber women 75 to 1 . <P> <P> *Named for the late Dr. Leo Buerger , a Vienna-born Manhattan surgeon who first fully described the disease in 1908.
