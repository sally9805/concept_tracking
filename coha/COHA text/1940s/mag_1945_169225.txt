" Three hundred and thirty thought Americans " soft , luxury-loving , rich , spiritually weak . " <P> More than half of the 500 believed that the Japanese Navy is the most powerful in the world . One hundred believed that the U. S. Navy has been sunk . <P> Who runs Japan ? Said 114 : " Do n't know . " Said 195 : " The Emperor . " Said 136 : " The military . " Said 55 : " The Cabinet .

Twenty-seven said that they would fight until it looked hopeless . Seventy-nine thought that they would not fight at all . <P> Most of the Japanese thought that Japan would win the war ( " I think Japan will win since I am a Japanese " ) .
