THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOM dully , struck the heart of the enigma . The sewing , when he ripped it open , was not his own clumsy stitching but a close firm seam , In a withering flash he knew who had taken his money : Mrs. Glennie . At half-past nine , outside the colliery village of Sanderston , in the dank wet mist which blurred his gig-lamps , a man in a dogcart almost ran down the solitary figure keeping the middle of the road . Only one person was likely to be driving in such a place on such a night . Dr. Tulloch , holding in his startled beast , peered downwards through the fog , his masterly invective suddenly cut short . " Great Lord Hippocrates ! It 's you . Get in . Quick , will you  --  before the mare pulls my arms from their sockets . " Tulloch wrapped the rug about his passenger ; proceeded without questions ; he knew the virtue of a healing silence , By half-past ten Francis was drinking hot broth before the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its occupants and so unnaturally still the cat slept peacefully on the hearth-rug . A mo- ment later Mrs. Tulloch came in , her hair in plaits , her quilted dressing gown open above her nightgown . She stood with her husband studying the dead-beat boy , who seemed unconscious of their presence , their murmured converse , wrapped in a curious apathy . Though he tried to smile , he could not when the doctor came forward , producing his stethoscope with a jocular air : " I 'll bet my boots that cough of yours is a put-up job . " But he submitted , opening his shirt , letting the doctor tap , and listen to , his chest . Tulloch 's saturnine face wore a queer expression as he straight- ened himself . His fund of humour had surprisingly dried up . He darted a look at his wife , bit his full lip , and suddenly kicked the cat . " Damn it to hell ! " he cried . " We use our children to build our battleships . We sweat them in our coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well ! I 'm proud to be a pagan . " He turned brusquely , quite fiercely , to Francis . " Look here , boy , who are these folks you knew in Tynecastle ? What 's that  --  Bannon , STRANGE VOCATION 41eh ? The Union Tavern . Get away home now and into bed unless you want treble pneumonia . " Francis went home , resistance crushed in him . All the next week Mrs. Glennie wore a martyred frown and Malcom a new checked waistcoat : price half a sovereign at the stores . It was a dire week for Francis . His left side hurt him , especially when he coughed ; he had to drag himself to work . He was aware , dimly , that his grandfather fought a battle for him . But Daniel was beaten down , defeated . All the little baker could do was to offer , humbly , some cherry cakes that Francis could not eat . When Saturday afternoon came round he had not the strength to go out . He lay upstairs in his bedroom gazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his heart gave a great and unbelieving bound . In the street below , slowly approaching , like a barque navigatingstrange and dangerous waters , was a hat , a thing of memory , unique , unmistakable . Yes , yes : and the gold-handled umbrella , tightly rolled , the short sealskin jacket with the braided buttons . He cried out weakly , with pale lips : " Aunt Polly . " The shop door pinged below . Dithering to his feet , he crept downstairs , poised himself , trembling , behind the half-glazed door . Polly was standing , very erect , in the centre of the floor , her lips pursed , her gaze sweeping the shop , as though amusedly inspecting it . Mrs. Glennie had half-risen , to confront her . Lounging against the counter , his mouth half-open , gaping from one to the other , was Malcom . Aunt Polly 's vision came to rest above the baker 's wife . " Mrs. Glennie , if I remember right ! " Mrs. Glennie was at her worst : still unchanged , wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck , a loose tape hanging from her waist . " What do you want ? " Aunt Polly raised her eyebrows . " I have come to see Francis Chisholm. " 42 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOM " He 's out . " " Indeed ! Then I 'll wait till he comes in . " Polly arranged herself on the chair by the counter as though prepared to remain all day . There was a pause . Mrs. Glennie 's face had turned a dirty red . She remarked , aside : " Malcom ! Run round to the bakehouse and fetch your father . " Malcom answered shortly : " He went to the Hall five minutes ago . He wo n't be back till tea . " Polly removed her gaze from the ceiling , brought it critically to bear on Malcom . She smiled slightly when he flushed , then , enter- tained , she glanced away . For the first time Mrs. Glennie showed signs of uneasiness . She burst out angrily : " We 're busy people here , we ca n't sit about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Like enough he wo n't be back till all hours  --  with the company he keeps . He 's a regular worry with his late hours and bad habits . Is n't that so , Malcom ? " Malcom nodded sulkily . " You see ! " Mrs. Glennie rushed on . " If I was to tell you every- thing you 'd be amazed . But it makes no difference , we 're Christian people here , we look after him . You have my word for it  --  he 's perfectly well and happy . " " I 'm glad to hear it , " Polly spoke primly , politely stifling a slight yawn with her glove , " for I 've come to take him away . " " What ! " Taken aback , Mrs. Glennie fumbled at the neck of her blouse , the colour flooding , then fading from , her face . " I have a doctor 's certificate , " Aunt Polly enunciated , almost masticated , the formidable phrase with a deadly relish , " that the boy is underfed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not true . " Polly pulled a letter from her muff and tapped it significantly with the head of her umbrella . " Can you read the Queen 's Eng- lish ? " " It 's a lie , a wicked lie . He 's as fat and well fed as my own son ! " There was an interruption . Francis , flat against the door , fol- lowing the scene in an agony of suspense , leaned too heavily against the ricketty catch . The door flew open , he shot into the middle of the shop . There was a silence . Aunt Polly 's preternatural calm had deepened . " Come over , boy . And stop shaking . Do you want to stay here ? " " No , I do n't . " Polly threw a look of justification towards the ceiling . " Then go and pack your things . " " I have n't anything to pack . " Polly stood up slowly , pulling on her gloves . " There 's nothing to keep us . " Mrs. Glennie took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't walk over me . I 'll have the law on you . " " Go ahead , my woman . " Polly meaningly restored the letter to her muff . " Then maybe we 'll find out how much of the money that came from the sale of poor Elizabeth 's furniture has been spent on her son and how much on yours . " Again there was a shattered silence . The baker 's wife stood , pale , malignant and defeated , one hand clutching at her bosom . " Oh , let him go , Mother , " Malcom whined . " It 'll be good rid-dance . " Aunt Polly , cradling her umbrella , examined him from top to toe . " Young man , you 're a fool ! " She swung round towards Mrs. Glennie . " As for you , woman , " looking straight over her head , " you 're another ! " Taking Francis triumphantly by the shoulder , she propelled him , bare-headed , from the shop . They proceeded in this fashion towards the station , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though he were some rare and captive creature who might at any moment escape . Outside the station she bought him , without comment , a bag of Abernethy biscuits , some cough drops , and a brand-new bowler hat . Seated opposite him in the train , serene , singular , erect , observing him moisten the dry biscuits with tears of thankfulness , extinguished almost by his new hat which enveloped him to the ears , she remarkedwith half-closed , judicial eyes :  --  44 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOM " I always knew that creature was no lady , I could see it in her face . You made an awful mistake letting her get hold of you , Francis dear . The next thing we 'll do is get your hair cut ! " III IT WAS wonderful these frosty mornings to lie warm in bed until Aunt Polly brought his breakfast , a great plate of bacon and eggs still sizzling , boiling black tea and a pile of hot toast , all on an oval metal tray stamped Allgood 's Old Ale . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then came the blessed knowl- edge that he need no longer fear the hooter . With a sob of relief he burrowed more deeply into his thick yellow blankets , in his cosy bedroom with its paper of climbing sweet peas , its stained boards and woolwork rug , a lithograph of Allgood 's Prize Brewery Dray Horse on one wall , of Pope Gregory on another , and a little china holy-water font with a sprig of Easter palm stuck sideways in it by the door . The pain in his side was gone , he seldom coughed , his cheeks were filling out . The novelty of leisure was like a strange caress and , though the uncertainty of his future still troubled him , he received it gratefully . On this fine morning of the last day of October , Aunt Polly sat on the edge of his bed exhorting him to eat . " Lay in , boy ! That 'll stick to your ribs ! " There were three eggs on the plate , the bacon was crisp and streaky , he had forgotten that food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his knees , he sensed an unusual festiv- ity in her manner . And soon she gave him one of her profound nods , " I 've news for you today , young man  --  if you can stand it . " " News , Aunt Polly ? " " A little excitement to cheer you up  --  after your dull month with Ned and me . " She smiled dryly at the quick protest in his warm brown eyes . " Ca n't you guess what it is ? " He studied her with the deep affection which her unceasing kind- ness had awakened in him . The homely angular face  --  poor-complexioned , the long upper lip downed with hair , a tufted blemish at the angle of the cheek  --  was now familiar and beautiful . " I ca n't think , Aunt Polly . " She was moved to her short rare laugh , a little snort of satisfactionat her success in provoking his curiosity . " What 's happened to your wits , boy ? I believe too much sleep has addled them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the routine of his convalescence had hitherto been tranquil . Encouraged by Polly , who had feared for his lungs ,  --  she had a dread of " consumption , " which " ran " in her family ,  --  he had usually lain abed until ten . Dressed , he accompanied her on her shopping , a stately progress through the main streets of Tynecastle which , since Ned ate largely and nothing but the best , demanded great prodding of poultry and sniffing of steak . These excursions were revealing . He could see that it pleased Aunt Polly to be " known , " deferred to , in the best stores . She would wait , aloof and prim , until her favourite shopman was free to serve her . Above all , she was ladylike . That word was her touchstone , the criterion of her actions , even of her dresses , made by the local milliner in such dreadful taste they sometimes evoked a covert snigger from the vulgar . In the street she had a graduated series of bows . To be recognized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanitary inspector or the chief constable  --  affordedher a joy which , though sternly concealed , was very great . Erect , the bird in her hat atwitter , she would murmur to Francis : " That was Mr. Austin , the tramway manager .. . a friend of your uncle 's . . . a fine man . " The height of her gratificationwas reached when Father Gerald Fitzgerald , the handsome portly priest of St. Dominic 's , gave her in passing his gracious and slightly condescending smile . Every forenoon they would stop in at the church and , kneeling , Francis would be conscious of Polly 's intent profile , the lips moving silently , above her rough chapped reverent hands . Afterwards she bought him something for himself , a stout pair of shoes , a book , a bag of aniseed drops . When he pro-46 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOMtested , often with tears in his eyes , as she opened her worn purse , she would simply press his arm and shake her head . " Your uncle wo n't take no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ned , her association with the Union Tavern . The Union stood near the docks at the corner of Canal and Dyke Streets , with an excellent view of the adjacent tenements , of coal barges , and the terminus of the new horse tramway . The brown painted stucco building was of two stories , and the Bannons lived above the tavern . Every morning at half-past seven Maggie Magoon , the scrubwoman , opened the saloon and began , talking to herself , to clean it . At eight precisely Ned Bannon came down , in his braces , but closely shaved , with his forelock oiled , and strewed the floor with fresh sawdust from the box behind the bar . It was unnecessary : a kind of ritual . Next , he inspected the morning , took in the milk and crossed the back yard to feed his whippets . He kept thirteen  --  to prove that he was not superstitious . Soon the first of the regulars began to drop in , Scanty Magoon always in the van , hobbling on his leather padded stumps to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tram driver or two , returning from the night shift . These workmen did not stop : only long enough to down their half of spirits and chase it with a glass , a schooner , or a pint of beer . But Scanty was a permanent , a kind of faithful watchdog , gazing propitiatingly at Ned as he stood bland , unconscious , behind the bar with its sombre woodwork and the framed notice : GENTLEMEN BEHAVE OTHERS MUST . Ned , at fifty , was a big thick figure of a man . His face was full and yellowish , with prominent eyes , very solemn in repose , matchinghis dark clothes . He was neither genial nor flashy , the qualities popularly attributed to a publican . He had a kind of solemn , bilious dignity . He was proud of his reputation , his establishment . His parents had been driven out of Ireland by the potato famine , he had known poverty and starvation as a boy , but he had succeeded against inconceivable odds . He had a " free " house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had many influential friends . He said , in effect , The drink trade is respectable and I proveSTRANGE VOCATION 47it . He set his face against young men drinking and refused rudely to serve any woman under forty : there was no Family Department in the Union Tavern . He hated disorder , at the first sound of it he would rap crossly with an old shoe  --  maintained handy for that purpose  --  on the bar , and keep rapping till the discord ceased . Though a heavy drinker himself he was never seen the worse for it . Perhaps his grin was loose , his eye inclined to wander on those rare evenings which he deemed " an occasion , " such as St. Patrick 's night , Halloween , Hogmanay , or after a day 's dog racing when one of his whippets had added another medal to the galaxy on the heavy watchchain that spanned his stomach . At any rate , on the following day he would wear a sheepish air and send Scanty up for Father Clancy , the curate at St. Dominic 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusting his knees , from the boards of the back room and pressed a sovereign for the poor-box into the young priest 's hand . He had a healthy respect for the clergy . For Father Fitzgerald , the parish priest , he had , indeed , considerable awe . Ned was reputed " comfortable , " he ate well , gave freely and , distrusting stocks and shares , had money invested in " bricks and mortar . " Since Polly had a competence of her own , inherited from Michael , the dead brother , he had no anxiety on her account . Though slow to form an affection , Ned was , in his own cautious word , " taken " with Francis . He liked the boy 's unobtrusiveness , the sparseness of his speech , the quiet way he held himself , his silent gratitude . The sombreness of the young face , caught unguarded , in repose , made him frown dumbly , and scratch his head . In the afternoon Francis would sit with him in the half-empty bar , drowsy with food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Scanty to Ned 's genial talk . Scanty Magoon , husband and encumbrance of the worthy witless Maggie , was so named because there was not enough of him , only in fact a torso . He had lost his legs from gangrene caused by some obscure disorder of the circulation . Capitalizing on his complaint , he had promptly " sold himself to the doctors , " signing a document which would deliver his body to the dissecting slab on his demise . Once48 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOMthe purchase price was drunk , a sinister aura settled on the bleary , loquacious , wily , unfortunate old scamp . An object now of popular awe , in his cups he indignantly declared himself defrauded . " I never got enough for myself . Them bloody scalpers ! But they 'll never get ahold of me poor old Adam ! God damn the fear ! I 'll enlist for a sailor and drown myself . " Occasionally Ned would let Francis draw a beer for Scanty , partly for charity , partly to give the boy the thrill of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , filling the mug  --  Scanty prompting anxiously , " Get a head on her , boy ! "  --  the foamy brew smelled so nutty and good Francis wanted to taste it . Ned nodded permission , then smiled in slow delight at the wryness of his nephew 's face . " It 's a acquired taste , " he gravely asserted . He had a number of such cliches , from " Women and beer do n't mix , " to " A man 's best friend is his own pound note , " which , through frequency and profundity of utterance , had been hallowed into epigrams . Ned 's gravest , most tender affection was reserved for Nora , daughter of Michael Bannon . He was devoted to his niece who when three had lost her brother from tuberculosis , and her father through that same murderous malady , so fatal to the Celtic race , two years later . Ned had brought her up , sent her off at the age of thirteen to St. Elizabeth 's , the best convent boarding school in Northumberland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavy fees . He watched her progress with a fond indulgent eye . When she came home for the holidays he was a new man : spryer , never seen in braces , ponderously devising excursions and amusementsand , lest anything should offend her , much stricter in the bar . " Well  --  " Aunt Polly was gazing half-reproachfully across the breakfast tray at Francis . " I see I 'll have to tell you what it 's all about . In the first place your uncle 's decided to give a party tonight to celebrate Halloween . . . and "  --  momentarily she dropped her eyes  --  " for another reason . We 'll have a goose , a four-pound black bun , raisins for the snapdragon , and of course the apples  --  STRANGE VOCATION 49your uncle gets special ones at Lang 's market garden in Gosforth . Maybe you 'll go over for them this afternoon . It 's a nice walk . " " Certainly , Aunt Polly . Only , I 'm not quite sure of where it is . " " Someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her main surprise . " Someone who 's coming home from her school to spend a iong week-end with us . " " Nora ! " he exclaimed abruptly . " The same . " She nodded , took up his tray and rose . " Your uncle 's pleased as punch she 's got leave . Hurry up and dress now , like a good boy . We 're all going to the station to meet the little monkey at eleven . " When she had gone Francis lay staring in front of him with a queer perplexity . This unexpected announcement of Nora 's arrival had taken him aback , and strangely thrilled him . He had always liked her , of course . But now he faced the prospect of meeting her again with an odd new feeling , between diffidence and eagerness . To his surprise and confusion he suddenly found himself reddening to the roots of his hair . He jumped up hurriedly and began to pull on his clothes . Francis and Nora started off , at two o'clock , on their excursion , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then walking across country toward Gosforth , each with a hand on the big wicker basket , swinging it between them . It was four years since Francis had seen Nora and , stupidly tongue-tied all through lunch , when Ned had surpassed himself in massive playfulness , he was still painfully shy of her . He remembered her as a child . Now she was nearly fifteen and , in her modestly long navy-blue skirt and bodice , she seemed quite grownup , more elusive and unreadable than ever before . She had small hands and feet and a small , alert provoking face , which could be brave or suddenly timid . Though she was tall and awkward from her growth her bones were fine and slender . Her eyes were teasing , darkly blue against her pale skin . The cold made them sparkle , made her little nostrils pink. 50 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOMOccasionally , across the basket handle , his fingers touched Nora 's . The sensation was remarkable : sweet and warmly confusing . Her hands were the nicest things to touch that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not dare look at her , though from time to time he felt her looking at him and smiling . Though the golden blaze of the autumn was past , the woods still glowed with bright red embers . To Francis the colours of the trees , of the fields and sky , had never appeared more vivid . They were like a singing in his ears . Suddenly she laughed outright and , tossing back her hair , began to run . Attached to her by the basket he raced like the wind alongsideuntil she drew up , gasping , her eyes sparkling like frost on a sunny morning . " Do n't mind me , Francis . I get wild sometimes . I ca n't help it . It 's being out of school , perhaps . " " Do n't you like it there ? " " I do and I do n't . It 's funny and strict . Could you believe it ? " She laughed , with a little rush of disconcerting innocence . " They make us wear our nightgowns when we take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me all the time you were away ? " " Yes . " He stumbled out the answer . " I 'm glad . . . I thought of you . " She threw him a swift glance , made as though to speak , and was silent . Presently they reached the Gosforth market garden . Geordie Lang , Ned 's good friend and the owner of the garden , was in the orchard , among the half-denuded trees , burning leaves . He gave them a friendly nod , an invitation to join him . They raked the crackling brown and yellow leaves towards the great smouldering cone he had already built , until the smell of the leaf smoke impregnatedtheir clothing . It was not work but glorious sport . They forgot their earlier embarrassment , competed as to who should rake the most . When he had raked a great pile for himself Nora mischievouslydespoiled it . Their laughter rang in the high clear air . Geordie Lang grinned in broad sympathy . " That 's women , lad . Take your pile and laugh at ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apple shed , a wooden erection at the end of the orchard . " You 've earned your keep . Go and help yourself ! " he called after them . " And give my best respects to Mr. Bannon . Tell him I 'll look in for my drop spirits sometime this week . " The apple shed was soft with crepuscular twilight . They climbed the ladder to the loft where , spaced out on straw , not touching , were rows and rows of the Ribston Pippins for which the garden was renowned . While Francis filled the basket , crouching under the low roof , Nora sat crosslegged on the straw , picked an apple , shone it on her bony hip and began to eat . " Oh , my , it 's good , " she said . " Have one , Francis ? " He sat down opposite , took the apple she held out to him . The taste was delicious . They watched each other eating . When her small teeth bit through the amber skin into the crisp white flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did not feel so shy in the dark little loft , but dreamy and warm , suffused with the joy of living . He had never liked anything so much as being here , in the garden , eating the apple she had given him . Their eyes , meeting frequently , smiled ; but she had a half-smile , strange and inward , that seemed entirely for herself . " I dare you to eat the seeds , " she teased suddenly ; then added quickly : " No , do n't , Francis ! Sister Margaret Mary says they give you colic . Besides a new apple tree will grow from each of those seeds . Is n't it funny ! Listen , Francis . . . you 're fond of Polly and Ned ? " " Very . " He stared . " Are n't you ? " " Of course . . . except when Polly coddles me every time I get a cough . . . and when Ned pets me on his knee  --  I hate that . " She hesitated , lowered her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nothing , I should n't , Sister Margaret Mary thinks I 'm impudent , do you ?

Why ? " She picked with sudden nervousness at the serge of her dress . " Oh , nothing . . . only , well . . . I like you . I 've always liked you . All those years I 've thought of you a lot and it would n't be nice if you . . . sort of disappeared again . " " Why should I disappear ? " He laughed . " You 'd be surprised ! " Her eyes , still childish , were wide and wise . " I know Aunt Polly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd give anything to see you made a priest . Then you 'd have to give up everything , even me . " Before he could reply she jumped up , shaking herself , with a great show of animation . " Come on , do n't be silly , sitting here all day . It 's ridiculous with the sun shining outside , and the party tonight . " He made to rise . " No , wait a minute . Shut your eyes and you might get a present . " Even before he thought of complying she darted over and gave him a hurried little kiss on the cheek . The quick warm contact , the touch of her breath , the closeness of her thin face with the tiny brown mole on the cheekbone , stunned him . Blushing deeply , unexpectedly she slipped down the ladder and ran out of the shed . He followed slowly , darkly red , rubbing the small moist spot upon his cheek as though it were a wound . His heart was pounding . That night the Halloween party began at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , closed the bar at five minutes to the hour . All but a few favoured patrons were politely asked to leave . The guests assembled upstairs , in the parlour , with its glass cases of wax fruit , the picture of Parnell above the blue-glass lustres , the velvetframedphotograph of Ned and Polly at the Giant 's Causeway , the bog oak jaunting car ,  --  a present from Killarney ,  --  the aspidistra , the varnished shillelagh hung on the wall with green ribbon , the heavy padded furniture which emitted a puff of dust when heavily sat upon . The mahogany table was fully extended , with legs like a dropsical woman , and set for twenty . The coal fire , banked halfway up the chimney , would have prostrated an African explorer . Thesmell , off , was of rich basting birds . Maggie Magoon , in cap and apron , ran about like a maniac . In the crowded room were the young curate , Father Clancy , Thaddeus Gilfoyle , several of the neighbouring tradesmen , Mr. Austin the manager of the tramways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , Ned , Polly , Nora and Francis . Amidst the din , with beaming benevolence and a sixpenny cigar , Ned stood laying down the law to his friend Gilfoyle . A pale , prosaic and slightly catarrhal young man of thirty was Thaddeus Gilfoyle , clerk at the gasworks ,  --  who in his spare time collected the rents of Ned 's property in Varrell Street , was a sidesman at St. Dominic 's , a steady-going chap who could always be relied on to do an odd job , to fill the breach , to " come forward , " as Ned phrased it ,  --  who never had two words to rub against one another nor a single idea that might be called his own , yet who somehow managed to be there , hanging around , on the spot when he was wanted , dull and dependable , nodding in agreement , blowing his nose , fingering his confraternity badge , fish-eyed , flat-footed , solemn , safe . " You 'll be for making a speech tonight ? " he now inquired of Ned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make a speech the world would be desolate . " Ah , I do n't know now . " Modestly yet profoundly , Ned considered the end of his cigar . " Ah , you will now , Ned ! " " They 'll not expect it . " " Pardon me , Ned , if I beg to differ . " " Ye think I should ? " With solemnity , " Ned , ye both should and would ! " " Ye mean . . . I ought to ? " " You must , Ned , and you will . " Delighted , Ned rolled the cigar across his mouth . " As a matter of fact , Thad , " he cocked his eye , significantly , " I have a announcement . . . a important announcement I want to make . I 'll say a few words later , since you press me. " 54 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOM Led by Polly as a kind of overture to the main event , the children began to play Halloween games  --  first snapdragon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on a big china dish , then duck-apple , dropping a fork from between the teeth over the back of a chair into a tub of swimming apples . At seven o'clock the " gowks " came in : working lads from the neighbourhood , with soot-blackened faces and grotesque attire , mumming their way around the district , singing for sixpences , in the strange tradition of All Hallows Eve . They knew how to please Ned . They sang " Dear Little Shamrock , " " Kathleen Mavourneen , " and " Maggie Murphy 's Home . " Largesse was distributed . They clattered out . " Thank you , Mr. Bannon ! Up the Union ! Good night , Ned ! " " Good lads . Good lads all of them ! " Ned rubbed his hands , his eye still moist with Celtic sentiment . " Now , Polly , our friends ' stomachs will be thinking their throats is cut . " The company sat down at table , Father Clancy said grace , and Maggie Magoon staggered in with the largest goose in Tynecastle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolved , in rich flavours , upon the tongue . His body glowed from the long excursion in the keen air and from a strange interior joy . Now and then his eyes met Nora 's across the table , shyly , with exquisite understanding . Though he was so quiet her gaiety thrilled him . The wonder of this happy day , of the secret bond which lay between them , was like a pain . When the repast was over Ned got up slowly , amidst applause . He struck an oratorical attitude , one thumb in his armpit . He was absurdly nervous . " Your Reverence , Ladies and Gentlemen , I thank you one and all . I 'm a man of a few words , "  --  a cry of " No , No " from Thaddeus Gilfoyle ,  --  " I say what I mean , and I mean what I say !

" As I was remarkin ' when Mrs. Magoon 's husband flung a brick at me . . . " Laughter . " . . . I favour the social occasion . I 'm sure we 're proud and pleased , every mother 's son of us ,  --  and daughter ,  --  to welcome into our midst my poor wife 's brother 's boy !

But I say and say it I will , Look at him now , I say , and when he came ! " Applause and Scanty 's voice in the corridor : " Maggie , for the love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Now , I 'm not one to blow my own trumpet ! I try to do fair between God and man and beast . Look at my whippets if ye do n't believe me . " Gilfoyle 's voice : " The best dogs in Tynecastle ! " A longer pause , during which Ned lost the thread of his speech . " Where am I ? " " Francis ! " Polly prompted quickly . " Ah , yes . " Ned raised his voice . " When Francis came , I said to myself , says I , Here 's a boy that might be useful . Shove him behind the bar and let him earn his keep ? No , by God  --  Saving your presence , Father Clancy  --  that 's not us . We talk it over , Polly and me .

" Your Reverence , Ladies and Gentlemen , I 'm pleased and proud to announcethat next month Francis starts off for Holywell ! " Making the name the triumphant keystone of his peroration , Ned sat down , perspiring , amidst loud applause . IvTxoucx the elm shadows were long upon the cropped lawns of Holywell , the northern June evening was still light as noon . The darkness would come late , so close to dawn the aurora borealis would but briefly glitter across the high pale heavens . As Francis sat at the open window of the high little study which he shared , since his election to the " Philosophers , " with Laurence Hudson and56 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOM Anselm Mealey , he felt his attention wander from the notebook , drawn , almost sadly , with a sense of the transience of beauty , to the lovely scene before him . From the steep angle of his vision he could see the school , a noble grey granite baronial mansion , built for Sir Archibald Frazer in 16og , and endowed , this century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same severity , lay at right angles , linked by a cloister , to the library , enclosing a quadrangle of historic turf . Beyond were the fives and handball courts , the playing fields , the end of a game still in progress , wide reaches of pasture threaded by the Stinchar River with stumpy black Polled Angus cattle grazing stolidly , woods of beech and oak and rowan clustering the lodge , and in the ulti- mate distance the backdrop , blue , faintly serrated , of the Aberdeen- shire Grampians . Without knowing ; Francis sighed . It seemed only yesterday that he had landed at Doune , the draughty northern junction , a new boy , scared out of his wits , facing the unknown and that first frightful interview with the Headmaster , Father Hamish MacNabb . He remembered how " Rusty Mac , " great little Highland gentleman , blood cousin to MacNabb of the Isles , had crouched at his desk be- neath his tartan cape , peering from bushy red eyebrows , dreadfully formidable . " Well , boy , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . nothing . " " Nothing ! Ca n't you dance the Highland Fling ? " " No , sir . " " What ! With a grand name like Chisholm ? " " I 'm sorry , sir . " " Humph ! There 's not much profit in you , is there boy ? " " No , sir , except sir . . . " Trembling : " . . . Maybe I can fish . " " Maybe , eh ? " A slow dry smile . " Then maybe we 'll be friends . " The smile deepened . " The clans of Chisholm and MacNabb fished together , ay , and fought together , before you or I were thought of . Run now , before I cane ye . " And now , in one more term , he would be leaving Holywell . Again his gaze slanted down to the little groups promenading to and fro on the gravelled terraces beside the fountain . A seminary custom ! Well , what of it ? Most of them would go from here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his room-mates walking together : Anselm , as usual , extrovert in his affections , one arm tenderlylinking his companion 's , the other gesticulating , but nicely , as befitted the outright winner of the Frazer Good Fellowship Prize ! Behind the two , surrounded by his coterie , paced Father Tarrant  --  tall , dark , thin . . . intense yet sardonic . . . classically remote . At the sight of the youngish priest Francis ' expression tightened oddly . He viewed the open notebook before him on the window ledge with distaste , picked up his pen and began , after a moment , his imposition . His frown of resolution did not mar the clean brown moulding of his cheek or the sombre clearness of his hazel eyes . Now , at eighteen , his body had a wiry grace . The chaste light heightened absurdly his physical attractiveness , that air , unspoiled and touching , which  --  inescapable  --  so often humiliated him . " June 14th , 1887 . Today there occurred an incident of such phenomenaland thrilling impropriety I must revenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by recording it . I ought n't really to waste this hour before vespers  --  afterwards I shall be dutifully cornered by Anselm to play handball  --  I should jot down Ascension Thursday : Fine day ; memorable adventure with Rusty Mac , and leave it . But even our incisive Administrator of Studies admitted the virtue of my breed  --  conscientiousness  --  when he said to me , after his lecture : Chisholm ! I suggest you keep a diary . Not of course for publication , '  --  his confounded satire flashed out ,  --  as a form of examen . You suffer , Chisholm , inordinately , from a kind of spiritual obstinacy . By writing your inmost heart out . . . if you could . . . you might possibly reduce it . ' " I blushed , of course , like a fool , as my wretched temper flared . Do you mean I do n't do what I 'm told , Father Tarrant ? ' " He barely looked at me , hands tucked away in the sleeves of his habit , thin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so unanswerably58 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOMclever . As he tried to conceal his dislike of me , I had a sharp awarenessof his hard shirt , of the iron discipline I know he uses unsparinglyupon himself . He said vaguely : There is a mental disobedience . . . ' and walked away . " Is it conceit to imagine he has his knife in me because I do not model myself upon him ? Most of us do . Since he came here two years ago he has led quite a cult of which Anselm is deacon . Perhaps he can not forget the occasion when , at his instruction to us upon the one , true , and apostolic religion ' I suddenly remarked : Surely , sir , creed is such an accident of birth God ca n't set an exclusive value on it . ' In the shocked hush which followed he stood nonplussed , but icy cold . What an admirable heretic you would have made , my good Chisholm . ' " At least we have one point in common : agreement that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridiculously pompously for a callow youth of eighteen . Perhaps it is what is named the affectation of my age . But I 'm worried . . . about several things . Firstly , I 'm terribly , probably absurdly , worried about Tynecastle . I suppose it 's inevitable that one should lose touch , when one 's home-leave ' is limited to four short summer weeks . This brief annual vacation , Holywell 's only rigour , may serve its purpose of keeping vocations firm , but it also strains the imagination . Ned never writes . His correspondence duringmy three years at Holywell has been effected through the medium of sudden and fantastic gifts of food : that colossal sack of walnuts for instance , from the docks , in my first winter , and last spring , the crate of bananas , three quarters of which were over-ripe and created an undignified epidemic amongst the clergy and laity ' here . " But even in Ned 's silence there 's something queer . And Aunt Polly 's letters make me more apprehensive . Her dear inimitable gossip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of , mainly , meteorological facts . And this change in tone arrived so suddenly . Naturally Nora has n't helped me . She is the original postcard girl , who scribbles off her obligations in five minutes , once a year , at the seaside . It seems , however , centuries since her last brilliant Sunset from Scarborough Pier ' and two letters of mine have failed even to produce a Moon over Whitley Bay . ' Dear Nora ! I shall never forget your Eve-like gesture in the apple loft . It 's because of you that I anticipate these coming holidays so eagerly . Shall we walk again , I wonder , to Gosforth ? I have watched you grow , holding my breath  --  seen your character  --  by which I mean your contradictions  --  develop . I know you as someone quick , shy , bold , sensitive and gay , a little spoiled by flattery , full of innocence and fun . Even now , I see your impudent sharp little face , lit up from within , as you indulge your amazing gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . or me  --  your skinny arms akimbo , blue eyes provoking , reckless , ending by flinging yourself into a dance of gleeful malice . Everything about you is so  --  human and alive , and  --  even those flashes of petulance and fits of temper which shake your delicate physique and end in such tremendous weepings . And I know , despite your faults , how warm and impulsive is your nature , making you run , with a quick and shamefaced blush , towards someoneyou have hurt . . . unconsciously . I lie awake thinking of you , of the look in your eyes , the tender pathos of your collar bones above your small round breasts . . . " Francis broke off here , and with a sudden flush scored out the last line he had written . Then , conscientiously , he resumed . " Secondly , I am selfishly concerned about my future . I 'm now educated above  --  here again Fr . Tarrant would agree  --  my station . I 've only another term at Holywell . Am I to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't continue to be a charge on Ned  --  or more justly Polly , since I recently ascertained quite by accident that my fees have been discharged , out of her modest income , by that wonderful woman ! My ambitions are so muddled . My fondness for Aunt Polly , my overbrimming gratitude , make me long to repay her . And it is her dearest wish to see me ordained . Again , in a place like this , where three quarters of the students and6o THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOMmost of one 's friends are predestined for the priesthood , it is hard to escape the inevitable pull of sympathy . One wants to line up in the ranks . Tarrant apart , Father MacNabb thinks I should make a good priest  --  I can feel it in his shrewd , friendly provocativeness , his almost Godlike sense of waiting . And as Principal of this College he should know something about vocations . " Naturally I 'm impetuous and hot-tempered ; and my mixed upbringinghas left me with a schismatic quirk . I ca n't pretend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teems with them  --  who lisp prayers throughout their infancy , make boyish shrines in the woods and sweetly rebuke the little girls who jostle them at the village fair . Keep away , Therese and Annabelle , I am not for thee . ' " Yet who can describe those moments that come to one suddenly : alone upon the back road to Doune , waking in the darkness in one 's silent room , remaining behind , quite solitary , when the scraping , coughing , whispering mob has gone in the empty yet breathing church . Moments of strange apprehension , of intuition . Not that sentimental ecstasy which is as loathsome to me as ever  --  Query : why do I want to vomit when I see rapture on the Master of Novices ' face ?  --  but a sense of consolation , of hope . " I 'm distressed to find myself writing like this  --  though it is for no other eye than mine . One 's private ardours make chilling stuff on paper . Yet I must record this inescapable sense of belonging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep conviction , under the measured , arranged , implacable movement of the universe , that man does not emerge from , or vanish into , nothing . And here  --  is it not strange ?  --  I feel the influence of Daniel Glennie , dear , cracked Holy Dan , feel his warm unearthly gaze upon me .... " Confound it ! And Tarrant ! I am literally pouring out my heart . If I am such a Holy Willie why do n't I set out and do something for God , attack the great mass of indifference , of sneering materialismin the world today . . . in short , become a priest ? Well . . . I must be honest . I think it is because of Nora . The beauty andSTRANGE VOCATION 61tenderness of my feeling for her overfills my heart . The vision of her face , with its light and sweetness , is before me even when I am praying to Our Lady in church . Dear , dear Nora . You are the real reason why I do n't take my ticket on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing and let his gaze travel into the distance , a faint frown on his brow , but his lips smiling . With an effort , he again collected himself . " I must , I must get back to this morning and Rusty Mac . This being a holiday of obligation , I had the forenoon on my hands . On my way down to post a letter at the lodge I ran into the Headmastercoming up from the Stinchar with his rod and without fish . He stopped , supporting his short burly form on the gaff , his ruddy face screwed up , rather put out , beneath his blaze of red hair . I do love Rusty Mac . I think he has some fondness for me and perhaps the simplest explanation is that we are so dourly Scottish and both of us fishers . . . the only two in the school . When Lady Frazer endowedthe College from her Stinchar properties , Rusty claimed the river as his own . The jingo in the Holywell Monitor beginning , I 'll not have my poolsWhipped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  for he 's a mad fisher . There 's a story of him , in the middle of mass at Frazer Castle , which Holywell serves , when his staunch friend , the Presbyterian Gillie , stuck his head through the window of the oratory , bursting with suppressed excitement . Your reverence ! They 're rising like fury in Lochaber Pool ! ' Never was a mass more quickly completed . The stupefied congregation , including Her Ladyship , was pattered over , blessed at breakneck speed ; then a dark streak , not unlike the local concept of the Devil , was seen flying from the sacristy . Jock ! Jock ! What flee are they taking ? ' " Now , he looked at me disgustedly . Not a fish in sight . Just when62 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOMI wanted one for the notables ! ' The Bishop of the diocese and the retiring principal of our English Seminary at San Morales were coming to lunch at Holywell that day . " I said , There 's a fish in the Glebe Pool , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , not even a grilse . . . I 've been out since six . ' " It 's a big one . ' " ' Imaginary ! ' " I saw it there yesterday , under the weir , but of course I did n't dare try for it . ' " From beneath his sandy brows he gave me his dour smile . You 're a perverse demon , Chisholm . If you want to waste your time  --  you 've my dispensation . ' He handed me his rod and walked off . " I went down to the Glebe Pool , my heart leaping as it always does at the sound of running water . The fly on the leader was a Silver Doctor , perfect for the size and colour of the river . I began to fish the pool . I fished it for an hour . Salmon are painfully scarce this season . Once I thought I saw the movement of a dark fin in the shadows of the opposite bank . But I touched nothing . Suddenly I heard a discreet cough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his best blacks , wearing gloves and his ceremonial top hat , had stopped , on his way to meet his guests at Doune Station , to condole with me . " ' It 's these large ones , Chisholm  --  ' he said with a sepulchral grin  --  ' they 're always the hardest ! ' " As he spoke , I made a final cast thirty yards across the pool . The fly fell exactly on the spume eddying beneath the far edge of the weir . The next instant I felt the fish , struck , and was fast in it . " ' Ye have one ! ' Rusty cried . Then the salmon jumped  --  four feet in the air . Though for my own part I nearly dropped , the effect on Rusty was stupendous . I could feel him stiffen beside me . In the name of God ! ' he muttered in stricken awe . The salmon was the biggest I had ever seen , here , in the Stinchar , or in my father 's Tweedside bothy . Keep his head up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give him the butt ! ' " I was doing my best . But now the fish was in control . It set off , STRANGE VOCATION 63downstream , in a mad tearing rush . I followed . And Rusty followed me . " The Stinchar , at Holywell , is not like the Tweed . It runs in a brown torrent through pines and gorges , making not inconsiderable somersaults over slippery boulders and high shaley ledges . At the end of ten minutes , Rusty Mac and I were half a mile downstream , somewhat the worse for wear . But we still stayed with the fish . " ' Hold him , hold him ! ' Mac was hoarse from shouting . You fool , you fool , do n't let him get in that slack ! ' The brute , of course , was already in the slack , sulking in a deep hole , with the leader ensnaredin a mess of sunken roots . " Ease him , ease him ! ' Mac hopped in anguish . Just ease him while I give him a stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones , trying to start out the fish without snapping the cast . The game continued for an agony of time . Then whirr !  --  off went the fish , to the scream of the reel . And off again went Rusty and I. " An hour later , or thereabouts , in the slow wide flats opposite Doune village , the salmon at last showed signs of defeat . Exhausted , panting , torn by a hundred agonizing and entrancing hazards , Rusty gave a final command . " Now , now ! On this sand ! ' He croaked : We 've no gaff . If he takes you down farther , he 's gone for good . ' " My mouth was gulpy and dry . Nervously , I stood the fish close . It came , quiet , then suddenly made a last frantic scuttle . Rusty let out a hollow groan . Lightly . . . lightly ! If you lose him now I 'll never forgive you ! ' " In the shallows the fish seemed incredible . I could see the frayed gut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an icy lump came under my shirt . I slid him gently to the little flat of sand . In an absolute tense silence Mac bent over , whipped his hand in the gills and heaved the fish , monstrous , onto the grass . " It made a noble sight on the green meadow , a fish of over forty pounds , run so freshly the sea lice still were on its arching back . " A record , a record ! ' Mac chanted , swept , as was I , by a wave of64 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOMheavenly joy . We had joined hands and were dancing the fandango . Forty-two pounds if it 's an ounce . . . we 'll put it in the book . ' He actually embraced me . Man , man  --  You 're a bonny , bonny fisher . ' " At that moment , from the single railway line across the river , came the faint whistle of an engine . Rusty paused , gazed in bewilderedfashion at the plume of smoke , at the toylike red-and-white signal which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He dug in consternation for his watch . Good Heavens , Chisholm ! ' His tone was that of the Holywell Headmaster . That 's the Bishop 's train . ' " His dilemma was apparent : he had five minutes to meet his distinguishedvisitors and five miles of roundabout road to reach the station  --  visible , only two fields away , across the Stinchar . " I could see him slowly make up his mind . Take the fish back , Chisholm , and have them boil it whole for luncheon . Go quickly now . And remember Lot 's wife and the pillar of salt . Whateveryou do , do n't look back ! ' " I could n't help it . Once I reached the first bend of the stream , from behind a bush , I risked a salty ending . Father Mac had already stripped to the buff and tied his clothing in a bundle . Wearing his top hat firmly on his head , with the bundle uplifted like a crozier , he stepped stark naked into the river . Wading and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his suit and sprinted manfully towards the approaching train . " I lay on the grass , rolling , in a kind of ecstasy . It was not the vision  --  which would live with me forever  --  of the top hat planted dauntlessly upon the nubile brow , but the moral pluck which lay behind the escapade . I thought : He too must hate our pious prudery , which shudders at the sight of human flesh , and cloaks the female form as though it were an infamy . " A sound outside made Francis pause and he ceased writing as the door opened . Hudson and Anselm Mealey came into the room . Hudson , a dark quiet youth , sat down and began to change his shoes . Anselm had the evening mail in his hand . STRANGE VOCATION 65 " Letter for you , Francis , " he said effusively . Mealey had grown into a fine pink-and-white young man . His cheek had the smoothness of perfect health . His eye was soft and limpid , his smile ready . Always eager , busy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school . Though his work was never brilliant , the masters liked him  --  his name was usually on the prize list . He was good at fives and racquets and all the less rough games . And he had a genius for procedure . He ran half a dozen clubs  --  from the Philatelists to the Philosophers . He knew , and glibly employed , such words as " quorum , " " minutes " and " Mr. Chair . " Whenever a new society was proposed , Anselm 's advice was sure to be invoked  --  automatically he became its president . In praise of the clerical life he was lyrical . His only cross was this singular paradox : the Headmaster and a few odd lonely souls cordially disliked him . To the rest he was a hero , and he bore his successes with open smiling modesty . Now , as he handed Francis the letter , he gave him that warm disarming smile . " Hope it 's full of good news , dear fellow . " Francis opened the letter . Undated , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Edward BannonUnion Tavern , Corner Dyke and Canal Streets , Tynecastle . Dear Francis , I hope this finds you well as it leaves me . Also please excuse pencil . We are all upset . It grieves me to tell you Francis you wo n't be able to come home this holiday . No one is more sick and sorry than me about it not having seen you since last summer and all . But believe me it is impossibleand we must bow to the will of God . I know you are not one to take no for an answer but this time you must the B.V.M. be my witness . I wo n't disguise we have trouble as you must guess but it is nothing you can help or hinder . It is not money nor sickness so do not worry . And it will all pass by the help of God and be forgotten . You can easy arrange to stay the holidays at the college . Ned will pay all extras . You 'll have your books and your nice surroundings and all . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so do n't fret . Ned has sold his whippets but not for the money . Mr. Gilfoyle is a comfort66 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOMto all . You are not missing much in the weather , it has been terrible wet . Now do n't forget Francis we have people in the house , there is n't no room , you are not underlined twice to come . Bless you my dear boy and excuse haste . Yours affectionately , POLLY BANNONAt the window , Francis read the letter several times : though its purpose was plain , its meaning remained troubling and inscrutable . With a strained look he folded the sheet and placed it in his pocket . " Nothing wrong I hope ? " Mealey had been studying his face solicitously . Francis , uncomfortably silent , hardly knew what to say . " My dear fellow , I am sorry . " Anselm took a step forward , placed his arm lightly , comfortingly , around the other 's shoulders . " If there 's anything I can do for mercy 's sake let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " perhaps you do n't feel like handball tonight ? " " No , " Francis mumbled . " I believe I 'd rather not . " " Quite all right , my dear Francis ! " The vespers bell rang . " I can see there is something bothering you . I 'll remember you tonight in my prayers . " All through vespers Francis worried about Polly 's incomprehensibleletter . When the service was over he had a sudden impulse to take his trouble to Rusty Mac . He went slowly up the wide staircase . As he entered the study he became aware that the Headmaster was not alone , Father Tarrant sat with him , behind a pile of papers ; and from the odd sudden silence his appearance provoked , Francis had the extraordinary feeling that the two had been discussing him . " I 'm sorry , sir . " He cast an embarrassed glance towards Rusty Mac . " I did n't know you were engaged . " " That 's all right , Chisholm . Sit down . " The quick warmth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into the wicker chair beside the desk . With slow movements of his stubby fingers Rusty went on stuffing shagSTRANGE VOCATION 67into his corroded briar pipe . " Well ! What can we do for you , my good man ? " Francis coloured . " I . . . I rather thought you 'd be alone . " For some queer reason the Headmaster avoided his appealing gaze . " You do n't mind Father Tarrant ? What is it ? " There was no escape . Without guile to invent further excuse Francis stumbled out : " It 's a letter I 've had . . . from home . " He had meant to show Polly 's note to Rusty Mac but , in Tarrant 's presence , his pride restrained him . " For some obscure reason they do n't seem to want me back for the vacation . " " Oh ! " Was he mistaken : was there again swift interchange between the two ? " That must be something of a disappointment . " " It is , sir . And I feel worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to ask you what I should do . " Silence . Father MacNabb himself sank more deeply into his old cape , still fumbling at his pipe . He had known many boys , known them inside-out ; yet there was about this youth who sat beside him a fineness , beauty , and dogged honesty which lit a fire in his heart . " We all have our disappointments , Francis . " His meditative voice was sad , more than unusually mild . " Father Tarrant and I have suffered one today . Retirements are the order of the day at our Seminary in Spain . " He paused . " We are appointed there , I as Rector , Father Tarrant as my Administrator of Studies . " Francis stammered a reply . San Morales was , indeed , a coveted advancement , next step to a bishopric ; but whatever Tarrant 's reaction  --  Francis shot a quick glance at the expressionless profile  --  MacNabb would not so regard it . The dry Aragon plains would be alien for a man who loved the green woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rusty Mac smiled gently . " I had my heart set on staying here . You had set yours on going away . What d' you say ? Shall we both agree to take a beating from Almighty God ? " Francis strove to pluck the proper phrase from his confusion . " It 's just . . . being anxious . . . I wondered if I should n't find out what 's wrong and try to help ? " 68 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOM " I question if I should . " Father MacNabb answered quickly . " What would you say , Father Tarrant ? " In the shadow , the younger master stirred . " Troubles resolve themselves best , in my experience , without outside interference . " There appeared nothing more to be said . The Headmaster turned up his desk lamp which , while it brightened the dark study , seemed to terminate the interview . Francis got up . Though he faced them both , haltingly , from his heart , he spoke to Rusty Mac . " I ca n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The school . . . I . . . I shall miss you . " " Perhaps we shall see you there ? " There was hope , quiet affectionin the voice . Francis did not answer . As he stood there , indecisively , hardly knowing what to say , torn by conflicting difficulties , his downcast gaze struck suddenly upon a letter , lying open on the desk . It was not so much the letter  --  illegible at that distance  --  as the letter 's bright blue-stamped heading which caught his eye . Quickly he glanced away . But not before he had read St. Dominic 's Presbytery , Tynecastle . A shiver went through him . Something was wrong at home . Now he was sure . His face revealed nothing , remained impassive . Neither of the two masters was aware of his discovery . But as he moved towards the door he knew , despite all persuasion to the contrary , that one course at least was clear before him. vTHE train arrived at two o'clock that sultry June afternoon . Carryinghis handbag , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster as he approached the familiar quarter of the city . A queer air of quiet hung outside the tavern . Thinking to take Aunt Polly by surprise , he ran lightly up the side stairs and entered the house . Here , too , it was quiet and oddly dim after the glare of the dusty pavements ; no one in the lobby or the kitchen , no soundSTRANGE VOCATION 69but the thunderous ticking of a clock . He went into the parlour . Ned was seated at the table , both elbows on the red drugget cover , gazing endlessly at the opposite blank wall . Not the attitude alone , but the alteration in the man himself , drew from Francis a stifled exclamation . Ned had lost three stones in weight , his clothes hung upon him , the rotund beaming face had turned dreary and cadaverous . " Ned ! " Francis held out his hand . There was a pause , then Ned sluggishly slewed round , perception slowly dawning through his settled wretchedness . " It 's you , Francis . " His smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were expected . " " I 'm not really , Ned . " Through his anxiety Francis essayed a laugh . " But the minute we broke up I simply could n't wait . Where 's Aunt Polly ? " " She 's away . . . . Yes . . . Polly 's away for a couple of days to Whitley Bay . " " When 'll she be back ? " " Like enough . . . tomorrow . " " And where 's Nora ? " " Nora ! " Ned 's tone was flat . " She 's away with Aunt Polly . " " I see . " Francis was conscious of a throb of relief . " That 's why she did n't answer my wire . But Ned . . . you . . . you 're well yourself , I hope ? " " I 'm all right , Francie . A trifle under the weather maybe .. . but the like of me 'll come to no harm . " His chest took a sudden grotesque heave . Francis was horrified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Away now and get yourself a bite . There 'll be plenty in the cupboard . Thad 'll get you anything you want . He 's below in the bar . A great help he 's been to us , has Thad . " Ned 's gaze wavered , then wandered back to the opposite wall . In a daze , Francis turned , put his bag in his own small room . As he came along the passage the door of Nora 's room was open : the neat white privacy caused him to withdraw his eyes in sudden confusion . He hastened downstairs. 70 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOMThe saloon was empty , even Scanty vanished , his vacant corner arresting , unbelievable , like a gap blown through the solid structure of the wall . But behind the bar , in his shirt sleeves , smugly drying glasses , was Thaddeus Gilfoyle . Thad stopped his silent whistle as Francis entered . Slightly taken aback , an instant elapsed before he offered a welcome with his limp and dampish hand . " Well , well ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Gilfoyle 's air of proprietorship was hateful . But Francis , now thoroughly alarmed , succeeded in affecting indifference . He said lightly : " I 'm surprised to see you here , Thad ? What 's happened to the gasworks ? " " I 've give up the office , " Thad answered composedly . " What for ? " " To be here . Permanent . " He picked up a glass and eyed it professionally , breathed on it softly , and began to polish . " When they asked me to come forward . . . I could n't do more ! " Francis felt his nerves tighten beyond endurance . " In the name of heaven , what 's all this about , Gilfoyle ? " " Mister Gilfoyle , if you do n't mind , Francis ! " Thad rolled his tongue smugly around the reproach . " It heartbreaks Ned not to see me get my place . He 's not the same man , Francis . I doubt he 'll ever be himself again . " " What 's happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind ! " " He was , Francis , he was . . . " Gilfoyle groaned , " but he 's come to senses now , poor man . " His eye watchful , he stopped Francis ' angry interruption with a whine . " Now do n't take on that way with me . I 'm the one that 's doin ' right . Ask Father Fitzgerald if you disbelieve me . I know you 've never liked me much . I 've seen ye on vacations making sport of me as you growed up . I 've the best intentions towards you , Francis . We ought to pull together .. . now , especially . " " Why now especially ? " Francis gritted his teeth . " Oh , yes , yes . . . you would n't know . . . to be sure . " ThadSTRANGE VOCATION 71darted a fearful smirk . " The banns was only put up for the first time last Sunday . You see , Francis , me and Nora 's going to be wed ! " Aunt Polly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick with apprehension , with his failure to penetrate Gilfoyle 's fishlikesecrecy , had awaited their arrival in an agony of impatience . He tried immediately to corner Polly . But Polly , after her first start , her wail of recognition ,  --  " Francis , I told you not to come , "  --  had fled upstairs with Nora , her ears closed to his importunities , reiterating the formula , " Nora 's not well . . . she 's sick I tell you . . . get out of my road . . . I 've got to tend to her . " Rebuffed , he climbed sombrely to his room , chilled by the mountingpremonitions of this unknown dread . Nora , having scarcely given him a look , had gone immediately to bed . And for an hour he heard Polly , scurrying with trays and hot-water bottles , entreatingNora in a low voice , persecuting her with agitated attentions . Nora , thin as a wand , and pale , somehow had the air of sick-rooms . Polly , worn and harassed , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture  --  a quick pressing of her hand against her brow . Late into the night , from her adjoining room , he heard the mutter of her prayers . Torn by the enigma , Francis bit his lip , turningrestlessly between his sheets . Next morning dawned clear . He rose and , according to his habit , went out to early mass . When he returned he found Nora seated outside on the back-yard steps warming herself in a patch of sunshinewhile at her feet some chickens cheeped and scuttled . She made no move to let him pass , but when he had stood a moment , she raised her head contemplatively . " It 's the holy man . . . been out already , saving his soul ! " He reddened at her tone , so unexpected , so quietly bitter . " Did the Very Reverend Fitzgerald officiate ? " " No . It was the curate . " " The dumb ox in the stall ! Ah , well , at least he 's harmless . " 72 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOM Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her thin chin upon a thinner wrist . Though she had always been slight he was startled to discover this almost childish fragility which matched so ill the sullen maturity in her eyes , and the new grey dress , womanly and costly , which stiffly adorned her . His heart melted , his breast was filled with a white fire , an unsupportable pain . Her hurt plucked at the chords of his soul . He hesitated , his gaze averted . His voice was low . " Have you had breakfast ? " She nodded . " Polly shoved it down my throat . God ! If she 'd only leave me be ! " " What are you doing today ? " " Nothing . " He paused again , then blurted out , all his feeling for her flood- ing through the anxiety in his eyes , " Why do n't we go for a walk , Nora ? Like we used to . It 's so glorious a day ! " She did not move . Yet a faint tinge of animation seemed to penetrate her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bothered , " she said heavily . " I 'm tired ! " " Oh , come on , Nora . . . please . " A dull pause . " All right . " His heart gave another great painful thud . He hurried into the kitchen and cut , with nervous haste , some sandwiches and cake , wrapped them clumsily into a packet . There was no sign of Polly and now , indeed , he was eager to avoid her . In ten minutes Nora and he sat in the red tram , clanging across the city . Within the hour , they tramped side by side , unspeaking , towards the Gosforth Hills . He wondered at the impulse which had sent him to this familiar stretch . Today the burgeoning countryside was lovely ; but its very loveliness was tremulous , unbearable . As they came upon Lang 's orchard , now foamy with blossom , he paused , tried to break the steely silence which lay between them . " Look , Nora ! Let 's take a stroll round . And have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the orchard , the trees standing spaced and stiff , like chessmen , around the apple shed . She said rudely , bitterly : " I do n't want to . I hate that place ! " He did not answer . Dimly he knew her bitterness was not towards him . By one o'clock they reached the summit of Gosforth Beacon . He could see that she was tired and , without consulting her , stopped under a tall beech , for lunch . The day was unusually warm and clear . In the flat distance beneath them , sparkling with golden light , lay the city , domed and spired , and from afar , ineffably beautiful . She scarcely touched the sandwiches he produced and , rememberingPolly 's demonstrative tyranny , he did not press her . The shade was soothing . Overhead the new green flickering leaves sent quiet patterns chasing across the moss , carpeted with dry beechnuts , on which they sat . There was a smell of flowing sap ; the throaty call of a thrush came from a high twig overhead . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tree , tilted her head , and closed her eyes . Her relaxation seemed somehow the greatest tribute she could pay him . He considered her with a deeper surge of tenderness , stirred to undreamed-of compassion by the arch of her neck , so thin and unprotected . The welling tenderness within him made him strangely protective . When her head slipped a little from the tree he scarcely dared touch her . Yet , fancying her asleep , he moved his arm instinctively to support her . The next instant she wrenched herself free , struck him repeatedly on the face and chest with her clenched knuckles , hysterically breathless . " Leave me alone ! You brute ! You beast ! " " Nora , Nora ! What 's the matter ? " Panting , she drew back , her face quivering , distorted . " Do n't try to get round me that way . You 're all the same . Every one of you ! " " Nora ! " He pleaded with her desperately . " For pity 's sake . . . let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " 74 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOM " Everything . . . why you 're going on like this . . . why you 're marrying Gilfoyle . " " Why should n't I marry him ? " She threw the question at him , with a bitter defensiveness . His lips were dry , he could scarcely speak . " But Nora , he 's such a poor creature . . . He 's not your sort . " " He 's as good as anybody . Have n't I said you 're all the same ? At least I 'll keep him in his place . " Confounded , he stared at her with a pale and stricken face . And there was that in his unbelieving eyes which cut her so cruelly , she more cruelly cut back . " Perhaps you think I should be marrying you . . . the bright-eyed altar boy . . . the half-baked carpet priest ! " Her lip twitched with the bitterness of her sneer . " Let me tell you this . I think you 're a joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn up your blessed eyes . You do n't know how funny you are . . . you holy pater noster . Why if you were the last man in the world I would n't . . . " She choked and shuddered violently , tried , painfully , uselessly , to check her tears with the back of her hand and then , sobbing , flung her head upon his breast . " Oh , Francis , Francis , dear , I 'm sorry ! You know I 've always loved you . Kill me if you want to . . . I do n't care . " While he quieted her , clumsily , stroking her brow , he felt himselftrembling as much as she . The racking violence of her sobs diminished gradually . She was like a wounded bird in his arms . She lay , spent and passive , her face hidden against his coat . Then slowly she straightened herself . With averted eyes , she took her handkerchief , rubbed her ravaged , tear-stained face , straightened her hat , then said , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . " " Look at me , Nora ? " But she would not , only remarking in that same odd monotone : " Say what you want to say . " " I will then , Nora . " His youthful vehemence overcame him . " I 'm not going to stand this ! I can see there 's something behind it . ButSTRANGE VOCATION 75I 'll get to the bottom of it . You 're not going to marry that fool Gilfoyle . I love you , Nora . I 'll stand by you . " There was a pitiful stillness . " Dear Francis , " she said , with an oddly hollow smile . " You make me feel as though I 'd lived a million years . " And rising , she bent and kissed him , as she had kissed him once before , upon the cheek . As they went down the hill the thrush had ceased its singing in the high tree . That evening , with fixed intention , Francis set out for the docksidetenement inhabited by the Magoons . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out charring , squatting by a spark of fire in the single " back to back " apartment , glumly workinga wool-rug shuttle by the light of a tallow dip . As he recognized his visitor there was no mistaking the pleasure in the exile 's bleary eye , a gleam that heightened when Francis uncovered the gill bottle of spirits he had privily removed from the bar . Quickly , Scanty produced a chipped delft cup , solemnly toasted his benefactor . " Ah , that 's the stuff ! " he muttered , across the back of his ragged sleeve . " Devil the sup have I had since that skinflint Gilfoyle took over the bar . " Francis drew up the backless wooden chair . He spoke with dark intensity , the shadows heavy beneath his eyes . " Scanty ! What 's happened at the Union  --  to Nora , Polly , Ned ? I 've been back three days and I 'm still no wiser . You 've got to tell me ! " A look of alarm invaded Scanty 's expression . He glanced from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ah ! How would I know ? " " You do know ! I can see it in your face . " " Did n't Ned say nothing ? " " Ned ! He 's like a deaf-mute these days !

" With a sudden hoarse em-76 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOMphasis : " I could n't tell ye , Francis , it 's a shame to remember , it do n't do no good . " " It will do good , Scanty , " Francis urged . " If I know , I can do something . " " Ye mean , Gilfoyle . . . " With head cocked , Scanty considered , then he nodded slowly . He took another tot to stiffen himself , his battered face oddly sober , his tone subdued . " I 'll tell you then , Francis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it is . . . God pity us . . . that Nora 's had a baby . " Silence : long enough for Scanty to take another drink . Francis said : " When ? " " Six weeks ago . She went down to Whitley Bay . The woman there has the child . . . a daughter . . . . Nora ca n't bear the sight of it . " Cold , rigid , Francis struggled with the tumult in his breast . He made himself ask : " Then Gilfoyle is the father ? " " That gutless fish ! " Hatred overcame Scanty 's caution . " No , no , he 's the one that came forward , as he 's pleased to call it , to give the little one a name , and get his foot in the Union to the bargain , the bla'g'ard ! Father Fitzgerald 's behind him , Francis . It 's all settin ' pretty as a pictur ' , the way they 've pulled it . Marriage lines in the drawer , not a soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it were , at the end of a long vaycation . God strike me down dead , if it do n't turn the stomach of a pig ! " A band , an insupportable constriction , girded Francis ' heart . He fought to keep his voice from breaking . " I never knew Nora was in love with anyone ? Scanty . . . Do you know who it was . . . I mean . . . the father of her child ? " " Before God I do n't ! " The blood rushed to Scanty 's forehead as he thumped the floor boards in vociferous denial . " I do n't know nothing about that at all . How should a poor creature like me ! And Ned do n't either , that 's gospel truth !

" Thank you , Scanty , for telling me . " He quitted the room , went giddily down the bare flights of tenement stairs . His brow , the palms of his hands , were bedewed with icy sweat . A vision haunted , tormented him : the trim neatness of Nora 's bedroom , white and undisturbed . He had no hatred , only a searing pity , a dreadful convulsion of his soul . Outside in the squalid courtyard he leaned , suddenly overcome , against the single lamppostand retched his heart out , into the gutter . Now he felt cold , but firmer in his intention . He set out resolutely in the direction of St. Dominic 's . The housekeeper at St. Dominic 's admitted him with that noiselessdiscretion which typified the Presbytery . In a minute , she glided back to the half-lit hall , where she had left him , and for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis . His Reverenceis free to see you . " Snuff-box in hand , Father Gerald Fitzgerald rose as Francis entered , his manner a mixture of cordiality and inquiry , his fine handsome presence matching the French furniture , the antique prie-dieu , the choice copies of Italian primitives upon the walls , the vase of lilies on the escritoire , scenting the tasteful room . " Well young man , I thought you were up North ? Sit down ! How are all my good friends in Holywell ? " As he paused to take snuff , his eye touched upon the College tie , which Francis wore , with affectionate approval . " I was there myself , you know , before I went to the Holy City . . . a grand gentlemanly place . Dear old MacNabb . And Father Tarrant . A classmate of mine at the English College in Rome . There 's a fine , a coming man ! Well now , Francis . " He paused , his needled glance sheathed by a courtier 's suavity . " What can we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis kept his eyes down . " I came to see you about Nora . " The stammered remark rent the room 's serenity , its note of mannered ease. 78 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOM " And what about Nora , pray ? " " Her marriage with Gilfoyle . . . She does n't want to go through with it . . . she 's miserable . . . it seems so stupid and unjust .. . such a needless and horrible affair . " " What do you know about the horrible affair ? " " Well . . . everything . . . that she was n't to blame . " There was a pause . Fitzgerald 's fine brow expressed annoyance , yet he gazed at the distraught youth before him with a kind of stately pity . " My dear young man , if you enter the priesthood , as I trust you will , and gain even half the experience which unhappily is mine , you will comprehend that certain social disorders demand equally specific remedies . You are staggered by this  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " horrible affair . I am not . I even anticipated it . I know and abominate the whiskey trade for its effect upon the brute mentality of the clods who constitute this parish . You and I may sit down and quietly enjoy our Lachryma Christi , like gentlemen . Not so Mr. Edward Bannon . Enough ! I make no allegations . I merely say , we have a problem , unhappily not unique to those of us who spend drab hours in the confessional . " Fitzgerald paused to take snuff , with a distinguished wrist . " What are we to do with it ? I will tell you . First , legitimize and baptize the offspring . Secondly , marry the mother if we can , to as decent a man as will have her . We must regularize , regularize . Make a good Catholic home out of the mess . Weave the loose ends into our sound social fabric . Believe me , Nora Bannon is highly fortunate to get Gilfoyle . He 's not so bright , but he 's steady . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass with her husband and family . . . perfectly happy . " " No , no . " The interruption was wrenched from Francis ' shut lips . " She 'll never be happy  --  only broken and miserable . " Fitzgerald 's head was a trifle higher . " And is happiness the ultimateobjective of our earthly life ? " " She 'll do something desperate . You ca n't compel Nora . I know her better than you . " " You seem to know her intimately . " Fitzgerald smiled withSTRANGE VOCATION 79withering suavity . " I hope you have no physical interest in the lady yourself . " A dark red spot burned on Francis ' pale cheek . He muttered : " I am very fond of Nora . But if I love her  --  it 's nothing that would make your confessional more drab . I beg you  --  His voice held a low , desperate entreaty . " Do n't force her into this marriage . She 's not common clay . . . she 's a bright sweet spirit . You ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her arms  --  because  --  in her innocence , she 's been . . . " Stung to the quick , Fitzgerald banged his snuff-box on the table . " Do n't preach at me , sir ! " " I 'm sorry . You can see I do n't know what I 'm saying . I 'm trying to beg you to use your power . " Francis mustered his flagging forces in a final effort . " At least give her a little time . " " That is enough , Francis ! " The parish priest , too much master of himself , and of others , to lose his temper or his countenance for long , rose abruptly from his chair and looked at his flat gold watch . " I have a confraternity meetingat eight . You must excuse me . " As Francis got up , he patted him reproachfully on the back . " My dear boy , you are very immature . Might I even say a little foolish ? But thank God you have a wise old mother in Holy Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis . They 've stood for generations  --  against stronger batterings than yours . But there now  --  I know you 're a good lad . Come up and have a chat about Holywell when the wedding 's over . And meanwhile  --  as a little act of reparation for your rudeness will you say the Salve Regina for my intention ? " A pause . It was useless , quite useless . " Yes , Father . " " Good night then , my son . . . and God bless you ! " The night air was raw and chill . Defeated , crushed by the impotenceof his youth , Francis dragged himself away from the Presbytery . His footsteps echoed dully on the paved pathway . As he passed the chapel steps , the sacristan was closing the side doors . When the last chink of light was gone , Francis stood , hatless , in the darkness , his eyes fixed on the wraith-like windows of the clerestory. 80 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOMHe blurted out , in a kind of final desperation : " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As the wedding day approached , consuming Francis with a deadly , sleepless fever , the atmosphere of the tavern seemed insensiblyto settle , like a stagnant pool . Nora was quiet , Polly vaguely hopeful ; and though Ned still cringed in solitude , the muddled terror in his eyes was less . The ceremony would , of course , be private . But no restraint need operate upon the trousseau , the dowry , the elaborate honeymoon to Killarney . The house was littered with robes and rich materials . Polly , beseeching another " try-on , " with a mouthful of pins , waded through bales of cloth and linen , enveloped in merciful fog . Gilfoyle , smugly observant , smoking the Union 's best cigars , would occasionally hold conference , upon matters of finance , with Ned . There was a deed of partnership , duly signed , and great talk of building , to accommodate the new menage . Already Thad 's numerous poor relatives hung about the house , sycophantic yet assertive . His married sister , Mrs. Neily , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had little enough to say . Once , meeting Francis in the passage , she stopped . " You know . . . do n't you ? " His heart was breaking , he dared not meet her eye . " Yes , I know . " There was a suffocating pause . He could not sustain the torture in his breast . Incoherently he burst out , boyish tears starting in his eyes : " Nora . . . We ca n't let this happen . If you knew how I 've felt for you . . . I could look after you  --  work for you . Nora .. . let me take you away . " She considered him with that strange and pitying tenderness . " Where would we go ? " " Anywhere . " He spoke wildly , his cheek wet and shining . She did not answer . She pressed his hand without speaking , then went on , quickly , to be fitted for a dress . On the day before the wedding , she unbent a little , losing somethingof her marble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 81of tea which Polly inflicted upon her , she declared : " I believe I 'd like to go to Whitley Bay today . " Astounded , Polly echoed : " Whitley Bay ? "  --  then added in a flutter , " I 'll come with you . " " There 's no need . " Nora paused , gently stirring her cup . " But of course if you want to . . . " " I do indeed , my dear ! " Reassured by that lightness in Nora 's manner ,  --  as though a bar of that old mischievous gaiety re-echoed , like distant music , in her being ,  --  Polly came to view the excursion without disfavour . She had a gratified , bewildered idea that Nora was " coming round . " As she finished her tea she discoursed upon the beautiful Lake of Killarney , which she had once visited as a girl . The boatmen there had been most amusing . The two women , dressed for the expedition , left for the station after the dinner hour . As she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Francis stood . She seemed to linger for a second , smiled gravely , and waved her hand . Then she was gone . News of the accident reached the district even before Aunt Polly was brought home , in a state of collapse , in a cab . The sensation throughout the city was impressive . Popular interest could never have been so stirred by the mere stupidity of a young woman stumblingbetween a platform and a moving train . It was the prenuptial timing which made the thing so exquisite . Around the docks women ran out of their doorways , gathering in groups , beshawled , arms akimbo . Blame for the tragedy was finally pinned upon the victim 's new shoes . There was enormous sympathy for Thaddeus Gilfoyle , for the family , for all young women about to be married and under the necessity of travelling by train . There was talk of a public funeral  --  with the confraternity band  --  for the mangled remains . Late that night , how he knew not , Francis found himself in St. Dominic 's church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sanctuary lamp drew his haggard eyes , a feeble beacon . Kneeling , stiff and pale , he felt , like an embrace , the remorseless foreclosure of his destiny . Never had he known such a moment of desolation , 82 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOMof abandonment . He could not weep . His lips , cold and stricken , could not move in prayer . But from his tortured mind there soared an offering of anguished thought . First his parents ; and now Nora . He could no longer ignore these testaments from above . He would go away . . . he must go . . . to Father MacNabb . . . to San Morales . He would give himself entirely to God . He must become a priest . VIDURING Easter , in the year 1892 , an event occurred in the English Seminary of San Morales which set the place humming with a note of consternation . One of the students , in the subdiaconate , disappearedcompletely for the space of four entire days . Naturally the Seminary had witnessed other seditions since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Students had mutinied for an hour or so , skulking to the posada outside the walls , hurriedly deranging conscience and digestion with long cigarros and the local aguardiente . Once or twice it had been necessary to drag some tottering recusant by the ears from the dingy parlours of the Via Amorosa in the town . But this  --  for a student to march out through the open gates in broad daylight and , half a week later , by the same gates , in even brighter light of day , to limp in again , dusty , unshaven , dishevelled , offering every evidence of horrible dissipation , and then , with no other excuse than " I 've been for a walk ! " to fling himself upon his bed and sleep the clock round  --  it was apostasy . At the recreation the students discussed it in awed tones  --  little groups of dark figures on the sunny slopes , between the bright green copperas-sprayed vineyards , with the Seminary , white and gleaming against the pale pink earth , beneath them . It was agreed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had immediately been constituted . According to precedent , as in all grave breaches of disciplineSTRANGE VOCATION 83it was composed of the Rector , the Administrator , the Director of Novices and the Head Seminarian . After some preliminary discussion , the tribunal opened its proceedings , in the theological atrium , on the day following the runagate 's return . Outside the solano was blowing . The ripe black olives fell from the blade-leafed trees and burst beneath the sun . A scent of orange flowers swept across from the grove above the infirmary . The baked earth crackled with the heat . As Francis entered the white and lofty-pillared room , its polished empty benches cool and dark , he had a quiet air . The black alpaca soutane stressed the thinness of his figure . His hair , cropped and tonsured , gave tautness to his face-bones , intensified the darkness of his eyes , his dark contained reserve . There was an odd tranquillity about his hands . Before him , on the platform reserved for protagonists in debate , were four desks , already occupied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mealey . Conscious of a mingling of displeasure and concern in the united gaze now upon him , Francis hung his head , while in a rapid voice Gomez , Director of Novices , read out the accusation . There was a silence . Then Father Tarrant spoke . " What is your explanation ? " Despite the quietness which enclosed him Francis suddenly began to flush . He kept his head down . " I went for a walk ! " The words resounded lamely . " That is sufficiently apparent . We use our legs whether our intentionsare good or bad . Apart from the obvious sin of leaving the Seminary without permission , were your intentions bad ? " " No . " " During your absence did you indulge in alcoholic liquor ? " " No . " " Did you visit the bullfight , the fair , the casino ? " " No . " " Did you consort with women of ill fame ? " " No . " " Then what did you do ? " 84 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOMSilence again , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You would n't understand . I . . . I went for a walk ! " Father Tarrant smiled thinly . " Do you wish us to believe that you spent these entire four days ceaselessly perambulating the coun-tryside ? " " Well . . . practically . " " What destination did you reach eventually ? " " I  --  I got to Cossa ! " " Cossa ! But that is fifty miles away ! " " Yes , I suppose so . " " You were there for some specific purpose ? " " No . " Father Tarrant bit his thin lip . He could not brook obstruction . He had a sudden wild longing for the rack , the boot , the wheel . Small wonder the media:valists had recourse to such instruments ! There were circumstances which fully justified them . " I believe you are lying , Chisholm . " " Why should I lie  --  to you ? " A muffled exclamation came from Deacon Mealey . His presence was purely formal . As the chief prefect he sat there as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . Yet he could not restrain his earnest pleading . " Please , Francis ! For the sake of all of the students . . . all of us who love you . . . I . . . I implore you to own up . " As Francis remained silent , Father Gomez , the young Spanish novice master , inclined his head and murmured to Tarrant : " I 've had no evidence . . . none whatever , from the town . But we might write to the priest at Cossa . " Tarrant shot a swift glance at the Spaniard 's subtle face . " Yes . That is decidedly an idea . " Meanwhile the Rector had taken advantage of the lull . Older , slower than at Holywell , he leaned forward . He spoke slowly and kindly . " Of course , you must realize , Francis , that in the circumstances , so general an explanation is barely adequate . After all , it is a seriousSTRANGE VOCATION 85matter to play truant  --  not merely the breaking of the Seminary rule  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Tell me ! Are you not happy here ? " " Yes , I am happy . " " Good ! And you 've no reason to doubt your vocation ? " " No ! I want more than ever to try to do some good in the world . " " That pleases me greatly . You do n't wish to be sent away ? " " No ! " " Then tell us in your own words how you came to  --  to take your remarkable adventure . " At the quiet encouragement , Francis raised his head . He made a great effort , his eyes remote , his face troubled . " I . . . I had just been to the chapel . But I could n't pray , I could n't seem to settle . I was restless . The solano was blowing  --  the hot wind seemed to make me more restless , the routine of the Seminary suddenly seemed petty and vexatious . Suddenly , I saw the road outside the gates , white and soft with dust . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking . I walked all night , miles and miles . I walked  --  " " All the next day . " Father Tarrant bit out the satiric interruption . " And the next ! " " That 's what I did . " " I never heard such a pack of rubbish in my life ! It is an insult to the intelligence of the Committee . " The Rector , with frowning resolution , suddenly straightened himself in his chair . " I propose that we temporarily adjourn . " While the two priests stared at him in surprise , he said decisively to Francis : " You may go for the present . If we think it necessary we will recall you . " Francis left the room in a dead silence . Only then did the Rector turn to the others . He declared coldly : " I assure you that bullying will do no good . We must go carefully . There is more in this than meets the eye . " Smarting under the interference , Father Tarrant moved fretfully . " It is the culmination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE KINGDOM STRANGE VOCATION 87 " Not at all . " The Rector demurred . " He 's been eager and perseveringever since he came here . There is nothing damaging in his record , Father Gomez ? " Gomez turned the pages , on the desk , before him . " No . " He spoke slowly , reading from the record . " A few practical jokes . Last winter he set fire to the English newspaper when Father Despard was perusing it in the common room . Asked why . . . he laughed and answered , The Devil finds work for idle hands ! ' " " Never mind that . " The Rector spoke sharply . " We all know Father Despard corners every paper that comes into this Seminary . " " Then , " Gomez resumed , " when deputed to read aloud in the refectory he smuggled in and substituted for The Life of St. Peter of Alcantara a C. R. S. tract entitled When Eva Stole the Sugar which  --  until he was stopped  --  induced much unseemly hilarity . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gomez turned another page . " In the comical processionthe students got up , representing the Sacraments  --  you may remember , one dressed up as a baby representing Baptism , two others were got up as Matrimony , and so on  --  it was all done with permission of course . But , " Gomez shot a dubious glance at Tarrant , " on the back of the corpse carried in for Extreme Unction , Chisholm pinned a card : " Here lies Father TarrantI 've gladly signed his warrant . If ever  --  " " That 's enough . " Tarrant broke in sharply . " We 've more to concernus than these absurd lampoons . " The Rector nodded . " Absurd , yes . But not malicious . I like a young man who can knock some fun out of life . We can not ignore the fact that Chisholm is an unusual character  --  most unusual . He has great depth and fire . He 's sensitive , inclined to fits of melancholy . He conceals it behind these high spirits . You see , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's a queer mixture of childlike simplicity and logical directness . And , above all , he 's a complete in-dividualist ! " " Individualism is rather a dangerous quality in a theologian , " Tarrant interposed acidly . " It gave us the Reformation . " " And the Reformation gave us a better-behaved Catholic Church . " The Rector smiled mildly at the ceiling . " But we 're getting from the point . I do n't deny there 's been a gross breach of discipline . It must be punished . But the punishment can not be rushed . I ca n't expel a student of Chisholm 's quality without first knowing positivelythat he deserves expulsion . Therefore , let us wait a few days . " He rose , innocently . " I 'm sure you all agree . " As the three priests left the platform , Gomez and Tarrant went off together . During the next two days an air of suspended doom overhung the unhappy Francis . He was not restrained . No apparent ban was placed upon his studies . But wherever he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  an unnatural silence struck his fellows , followed swiftly by an exaggerated casualness which deceivedno one . The knowledge that he was the universal topic gave him a guilty look . His Holywell companion , Hudson , also in the subdiaconate , pursued him with affectionate attentions and a worried frown . Anselm Mealey led another faction which clearly felt itself outraged . At recreation they consulted , approached the solitary figure . Mealey was the spokesman . " We do n't want to hit you when you 're down , Francis . But this touches all of us . It 's a slur upon the student body as a whole . We feel that it would be so much finer and manlier if you would make a clean breast and own up to it . " " Own up to what ? " Mealey shrugged his shoulders . There was a silence . What more could he do ? As he turned away with the others he said : " We 've decided to make a novena for you . I feel it worse than the others .

He drifted about , aware that for Tarrant and the other professors he had ceased to exist . At88 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOMthe lectures he found he was not listening . The summons to the Rector he half hoped for did not come . His sense of personal stress increased . He failed to understand himself . He was a purposeless enigma . He brooded over the justificationof those who had predicted that he had no vocation . He had wild conceptions of setting out as a lay brother to some dangerous and distant mission . He began to haunt the church  --  but secretly . Above all there existed the necessity of putting on a face to meet his little world . It was on the morning of the third day , Wednesday , that Father Gomez received the letter . Shocked but deeply gratified , his resourcefulnessconfirmed , he ran with it to the Administrator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the note , like an intelligent dog awaiting its reward , a kind word or a bone . Mi Amigo , In reply to your honoured communication of Whit-Sunday , I deeply regret to inform you that inquiries have elicited the fact that a Seminarian , of such bearing , height and colour as you define , was observed in Cossa on April 14th . He was seen to enter the house of one Rosa Oyarzabal late that evening and to leave early the following morning . The woman in question lives alone , is of a known character , and has not frequented the altar rails for seven years . I have the honour to remain , dear Padre , Your devoted brother in Jesus Christus , SALVADOR BOLASP . P. CossaGomez murmured : " Do n't you agree it was good strategy ? " " Yes , yes ! " With a brow of thunder Tarrant brushed the Spaniard aside . Bearing the letter like something obscene , he strode into the Rector 's room at the end of the corridor . But the Rector was saying his mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Tarrant could not wait . He crossed the courtyard like a whirlwind and , without knocking , burst into Francis ' room . It was empty . Checked , realizing that Francis must also be at mass , he struggled with his fury as an ungovernable horse might fight its bit . He satSTRANGE VOCATION 89down , abruptly , forcing himself to wait , his dark thin figure charged with lightning . The cell was barer even than others of its kind , its inventory a bed , a chest , a table , the chair he occupied . Upon the chest stood one faded photograph , an angular woman in a frightful hat holding the hand of a white-clad little girl : Love from Aunt Polly and Nora . Tarrant repressed his sneer . But his lip curled at the single picture on the whitewashed walls , a tiny replica of the Sistine Madonna , Our Lady of Chastity . Suddenly , upon the table , he saw an open notebook : a diary . Again he started , like a nervous horse , his nostrils dilated , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sat , battling his scruples , then rose and went slowly towards the book . He was a gentleman . It was repugnantto pry like a vulgar chambermaid , into another 's privacy . But it was his duty . Who could guess what further iniquities this scroll contained ? With relentless austerity upon his face , he picked up the written page. " ... was it Saint Anthony who spoke of his ill-judged , obstinate and perverse behaviour ' ? I must console myself in the greatest despondency I have ever known , with that single thought ! If they send me away from here my life will be broken . I 'm a miserable crooked character , I do n't think straight like the others , I can not train myself to run with the pack . But with my whole soul I desire passionately to work for God . In our Father 's house there are many mansions ! There was room for such diversities as Joan of Arc and ... well , Blessed Benedict Labre who let even the lice run over him . Surely there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain to them . How can one explain nothing  --  or what is so obvious as to be shameful ? Francis de Sales said : I will be ground to powder rather than break a rule . ' But when I walked out of the Seminary I did not think of rules , or of breaking them . Certain impulses are unconscious . " It helps me to write this down : it gives my transgression the semblance of reason. 90 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOM " For weeks I had been sleeping badly , tossing through these hot nights in a fever of unrest . Perhaps it is harder for me here than for the others  --  judged at least by the voluminous literature on the subject , wherein the steps to the priesthood are represented as sweet untroubled joys , piled one upon another . If our beloved laity knew how one has to fight ! " Here my greatest difficulty has been the sense of confinement , of physical inaction  --  what a bad mystic I should make !  --  always aggravated by echoes , stray sounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am twenty-three , that I have done nothing yet to help a single living soul , and I am fevered with unrest . " Willie Tulloch 's letters provide  --  in Father Gomez ' phrase  --  the most pernicious stimuli . Now that Willie is a qualified doctor and his sister Jean a certified nurse , both working for the Tynecastle Poor Law Board and enjoying many thrilling , if verminous adventures , in the slums , I feel that I should be out and fighting too . " Of course I shall , one day . . . . I must be patient . But my present ferment seems heightened by the news of Ned and Polly . I was happy when they decided to remove from above the tavern and have Judy , the child , to live with them in the little flat which Polly had taken at Clermont , on the outskirts of the city . But Ned has been ill , Judy troublesome , and Gilfoyle  --  left to manage Union Tavern  --  a most unsatisfactory business partner . Ned , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees no one . That one impulse of blind unthinkable stupidity has finished him . A baser man would have survived it . " The pattern of life sometimes demands great faith . Dear Nora ! That tender platitude conceals a thousand avenues of thought and feeling . When Father Tarrant gave us that practical talk  --  agendo contra  --  he said most truly : Some temptations can not be fought  --  one must close one 's mind and fly from them ! ' My excursion to Cossa must have been that kind of flight . " At first , though walking fast , I did not mean to go far when ISTRANGE VOCATION 91passed through the Seminary gates . But the relief , the sense of escape from myself which the violent exercise afforded , drove me on . I sweated gloriously , like a peasant in the fields  --  that salty running sweat which seems to purge one of human dross . My mind lifted , my heart began to sing . I wanted to go on and on until I dropped ! " I walked all day without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , when evening drew near , I could smell the sea . And as the stars broke out in the pale sky , I came over the hill and found Cossa at my feet . The village , harboured on a sheltered creek where the sea barely lapped , with blossoming acacia trees lining its single street , had an almost heavenly beauty . I was dead with tiredness . There was an enormous blister on my heel . But as I came down the hill the place welcomed me with its quiet pulse of life . " In the little square the villagers were enjoying the cool air , scented with acacia flowers , the dusk made dimmer by the lamps of the little inn , where at an open doorway stood two pine benches . Before the benches in the soft dust some old men were playing bowls with wooden balls . From the creek came the booming of frogs . Children laughed and ran . It was simple and beautiful . Though I now realized that I had not a peseta in my pocket , I seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How good it was to rest . I was stupid with fatigue . Suddenly , in the quiet darkness beneath the trees , the sound of Catalan pipes rang out . Not loud  --  low , attuned to the night . If one has not heard these reeds , or the shrill , sweet native tunes , one can not fully estimate the gladness of that moment . I was enchanted . I suppose , as a Scot , I 've the lilt of the pipes in my blood . I sat as though drugged by the music , the darkness , the beauty of the night , my utter weakness . " I had resolved to sleep out on the beach . But presently , as I thought to move there , a mist rolled in from the sea . It fell like a mystery upon the village . In five minutes the square was choked with twisting vapour , the trees dripping , and everybody going home . I had reached the conclusion , unwillingly , that I must go to the local priest , give myself up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the92 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOMother bench suddenly spoke to me . For some time I had felt her gazing at me with that mixture of pity and contempt which the mere sight of a religious seems to provoke in Christian countries . Now , as if she read my thoughts , she said : They are tight people there . They will not take you in . ' " She was about thirty years of age , dressed quietly in black , with a pale face , dark eyes and a thickened figure . She continued in-differently : " There is a bed in my house if you wish to sleep in it . ' " I have no money to pay for a lodging . ' " She laughed scornfully . You can pay me with your prayers . ' " It had now begun to rain . They had closed the fonda . We both sat on the wet benches under the dripping acacia trees in the deserted square . The absurdity of this seemed to strike her . She rose . " I am going home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hospitality . ' " My thin soutane was soaked . I had begun to shiver . I reflected that I could send her money for my room on my return to the Seminary . I got up and walked with her down the narrow street . " Her house was halfway down the row . We descended two steps into the kitchen . When she had lit the lamp , she threw off the black shawl , put a pot of chocolate on the fire and took a new loaf from the oven . She spread a red-checked tablecloth . Bubbling chocolate and hot bread made a good smell in the small clean room . " As she poured the chocolate into thick cups she looked at me across the table . You had better say grace . That improves the flavour ! ' Though now there was no mistaking the irony in her voice , I said grace . We began to eat and drink . The flavour needed no improvement . " She kept watching me . She had once been a very pretty woman , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard . Her small ears were close to her head and pierced with heavy gold rings . Her hands were plump like the hands of a Rubens Madonna . " Well , little padre , you are lucky to be here . I have no liking forSTRANGE VOCATION 93the priests . In Barcelona , when I pass them I break into open laughter ! ' " I could n't help smiling . You do n't surprise me . It 's the first thing we learn  --  to be laughed at . The best man I ever knew used to preach in the open air . The whole town turned out to laugh at him . They named him , in mockery , Holy Daniel . You see , there 's so little doubt nowadays that anyone who believes in God is a hypocrite or a fool ! ' " She took a slow drink of chocolate , watching me over her cup . You are no fool .

But I know why you are here , my runaway priestling ; you are all the same . ' She got over her fit of pique , and mocked : You forsake Mother Church for Mother Eve . ' " I was puzzled , then her meaning dawned on me . It was so absurd I wanted to laugh . But it was annoying too  --  I supposed I 'd have to clear out . I had finished my bread and chocolate . I rose and took my hat . Thank you exceedingly for my supper . It was ex-cellent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it by surprise . So you are a hypocrite then . ' She bit her lip sulkily .

You should see me Saturday evenings , sitting in the Cava at Barcelona  --  more fun than ever you 'll have in your miserable little life . Go upstairs and sleep . ' 94 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOM " There was a pause . Her attitude now seemed reasonable ; and I could hear the rain outside . I hesitated , then moved towards the narrow stairs . My feet were swollen and smarting . I must have limped badly , for she exclaimed suddenly , coldly : What is the matter with your precious foot ? ' " It 's nothing ... only blistered .

Then she stood up . " That should feel better . Your socks will be ready for you in the morning . ' " How can I thank you ? ' " She said unexpectedly in an odd dull tone : What does one do with a life like mine ! ' Before I could answer she raised the pitcher in her right hand . Do not preach at me or I will break your head . Your bed is on the second landing . Good night . ' " She turned away towards the fire . I went upstairs , found a small room beneath the skylight . I slept as though stunned . " Next morning when I came down , she was moving about the kitchen , making coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave I tried to express my gratitude . But she cut me short . She gave me her sad peculiar smile . You are too innocent to be a priest . You will be a great failure . ' " I started back for San Morales . I was lame and rather scared of my reception . I was afraid . I took my time . " Father Tarrant remained motionless at the window for a long moment , then quietly replaced the diary upon the table , reminded by a glint of recollection that it was he who had first asked Francis to keep it . Methodically he tore the Spanish priest 's letter into fragments . The expression on his face was quite remarkable . ForSTRANGE VOCATION 95once it lacked its bleakness , that iron austerity seared into every feature by pitiless self-mortification . It became a young face , flooded with generosity and thoughtfulness . With his clenched hand still holding the pieces of the letter , slowly , almost unconsciously , he struck his breast three times . Then he spun round and left the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head came up and around the spiral balustrade . Observing Father Tarrant , the model seminarian dared to pause . He admired the Administrator to excess . To be noticed by him was a heavenly joy . He ventured modestly :  --  " Excuse me , sir . We are all very anxious . I am wondering if there is any more news . . . concerning Chisholm ? " " What news ? " " Well . . . of his leaving . " Tarrant contemplated his creature with remote distaste . " Chisholm is not leaving . " He added , with sudden violence , " You fool ! " That evening as Francis sat in his study , dizzy and unbelieving under the miracle of his redemption , one of the college servants silently handed in a packet . It contained a superb figure of the Virgin of Montserrat carved in ebony , a tiny masterpiece of fifteenthcenturySpanish craftsmanship . No message accompanied the exquisitething . Not a word of explanation . Suddenly , with a wild consuming thought , Francis remembered he had seen it above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rector , meeting Francis at the end of the week , who put his finger on the manifest inconsistency . " It strikes me , young sir , that you have escaped gey lightly , through a sinister screen of sanctity . In my young days playing truant  --  plunking ' we called it  --  was a punishable crime . " He fixed on Francis his shrewd and twinkling gaze . " As a penance you might write me an essay  --  two thousand words  --  on The Virtue of Walking . ' " In the small universe of a seminary the very walls have ears , the keyholes diabolic vision . The story of Francis ' escapade came graduallyto light , was fitted , piece by piece , together . It grew , gained indeed , as it passed from lip to ear . Assuming the facets of the finished96 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOMgem , it seemed likely to descend  --  a classic in the Seminary 's history . When Father Gomez had the final details , he wrote fully to his friend the parish priest of Cossa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glowing five-page letter , of which , perhaps , the final paragraph merits quotation : Naturally , the pinnacle of achievement would have been the conversionof the woman , Rosa Oyarzabal . How wonderful it would have been had she come to me and wept , on her knees , in true contrition , as the result of our young apostle 's visitation ! But alas ! She has gone into partnership with another madam and opened a brothel in Barcelona , which I grieve to report is flourishing . IIIAN UNSUCCESSFUL CURATEIIT was raining steadily , early that Saturday evening in January when Francis arrived at Shalesley , on the branch line , some forty miles from Tynecastle . But nothing could damp the eagerness , the burning of his spirit . While the train disappeared into the mist , he stood expectantly on the wet open platform , his alert eyes sweeping its dreary vacancy . No one had come to meet him . Undismayed , he picked up his bag and swung into the main street of the colliery village . The Church of the Redeemer should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointment , his first curacy . He could scarcely believe it . His heart sang . . . at last , at last , newly ordained , he had his chance to get into the battle and fight for human souls . Though he had been forewarned , Francis had never seen greater ugliness than that which now surrounded him . Shalesley consisted of long grey rows of houses and poor cheap shops , interspaced with plots of waste land , slag heaps ,  --  smoking even in the rain ,  --  a refuse dump , several taverns and chapels , all dominated by the high black headstocks of the Renshaw Colliery . But he told himself gaily that his interest lay in the people , not the place . The Catholic church stood on the east side of the village , adjacent to the colliery , harmonizing with the scene . It was a big erection of raw red brick with Gothic blue-stained windows , a dark red corrugated iron roof , and a sawed-off rusty spire . The school lay on one side ; the Presbytery , fronted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the other . With a deep , excited breath , Francis approached the small , ramshacklehouse and pulled the bell . After some delay , when he was about to ring again , the door was opened by a stout woman in a blue striped apron . Inspecting him , she nodded . Ioo THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOM " It 'll be yourself , Father ! His Reverence is expecting you . In there ! " She pointed with privileged good nature to the parlour door . " What weather to be sure . I 'll away and put on the kippers . " Francis sturdily entered the room . Already seated at a table covered with a white cloth and laid for a repast , a thickset priest of about fifty stopped his impatient knife-tapping to greet his new curate . " You 're here at last . Come in . " Francis extended his hand . " Father Kezer , I imagine ? " " That 's right . Who did you expect ? King William of Orange ? Well , you 're just in time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called to the adjoining kitchen . " Miss Cafferty ! Are you going to be all night ? " Then , to Francis : " Sit down and stop looking like the lost chord . I hope you play cribbage . I like a game of an eve-ning . " Francis took a chair at the table and soon Miss Cafferty hurried in with a large covered dish of kippers and poached eggs . As Father Kezer helped himself to two eggs and a brace of kippers she laid another place for Francis . Then Father Kezer passed over the dish , his mouth full . " Go ahead and help yourself . Do n't stint . You 'll have to work hard here so you 'd better eat . " He himself ate rapidly , his strong crunching jaws and capable hands , felted with black hairs , never at rest . He was burly , with a round cropped head , and a tight mouth . His nose was flat , with wide nostrils out of which sprouted two dark snuff-stained tufts . He conveyed the impression of strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-assertion . As he cut an egg in two and slipped one half into his mouth his little eyes watched , formed an opinion of Francis , as a butcher might weigh the merits of a steer . " You do n't look too hardy . Under eleven stone , eh ? I do n't know what you curates are coming to . My last was a weak-kneed effort ! Should have called himself flea  --  not Lee  --  he had n't the guts of one . It 's this Continental la-de-da that ruins you . In myAN UNSUCCESSFUL CURATE IOItime  --  well , the fellows that came out of Maynooth with me were men . " " I think you 'll find me sound in wind and limb . " Francis smiled . " We 'll soon see . " Father Kezer grunted . " Go in and hear confessionswhen you 've finished . I 'll be in later . There wo n't be many tonight though . . . seeing it 's wet . Give them an excuse ! They 're bone lazy  --  my beautiful lot ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heavy bed and an enormous Victorian wardrobe , Francis washed his hands and face at the stained washstand . Then he hastened down towards the church . The impression Father Kezer had given him was not favourable , but he told himself he must be fair : immediate judgements were so often unjust . He sat for a long time in the cold confessional box ,  --  still marked with the name of his predecessor , FR . LEE ,  --  hearing the drumming of the rain on the tin roof . At last he came out and wandered round the empty church . It was a depressing spectacle  --  bare as a barn and not very clean . An unhappy attempt had been made to marble the nave with dark green paint . The statue of Saint Joseph had lost a hand and been clumsily repaired . The stations of the cross were sad little daubs . On the altar some gaudy paper flowers , in vases of tarnished brass , hit the eye like an affront . But these little shortcomings only made his opportunity the greater . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with throbbing fervour , dedicating his life anew . Habituated to the cultured atmosphere of San Morales , a halfwayhouse for scholars and preachers , men of breeding and distinctionmoving between London , Madrid and Rome , Francis found the next few days increasingly difficult . Father Kezer was not an easy man . Naturally irascible and inclined to surliness , age , experience , and failure to win affection from his flock had made him hard as nails . At one time he had held an excellent parish in the seaside resort of Eastcliffe . He had proved himself so disagreeable that important people in the town had petitioned the Bishop to remove him . The incident , at first bitterly resented , had been hallowed by time intoIO2 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOMan act of personal sacrifice . He would remark , soulfully : " Of my own free will I stepped from the throne to the footstool . . . but , ah ! . . . those were the days . " Miss Cafferty , his cook and housekeeper combined , alone stood by him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , she was of his own kidney , she could take his slangings and heartily slang him back . The two respected each other . When he departed on his annual six weeks ' holiday to Harrogate he allowed her to go home for her own vacation . In his personal habits he had scant refinement . He stamped around his bedroom , opened and slammed the single bathroom door . The matchboard house reverberated with his wind . Unwittingly , he had reduced his religion to a formula  --  with no conception of interior meanings , of the unsubstantial , no elasticity of outlook . " Do this or be damned " was imprinted on his heart . There were certain things to be accomplished with words , water , oil and salt . Without them , hell was ready , hot and gaping . He was deeply prejudiced , loudly voicing his detestation of every other denomination in the village  --  an attitude which did little to gain him friends . Even in his relations with his own congregation he was not at peace . The parish was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and despite a stringent economy he was often desperately pressed to make ends meet . He had a legitimate case to place before his people . But his natural ire was a poor substitute for tact . In his sermons , planted solidly on his feet , head thrust aggressively forward , he lashed the sparse congregation for its neglect . " How do you expect me to pay the rent , and the taxes , and the insurance ? And keep the church roof over your heads ? You 're not giving it to me , you 're giving it to Almighty God . Now listen to me , every man and woman of ye . It 's silver I want to see in the plate , not your miserable brass farthings . You 're most of you in work you men , thanks to the generosity of Sir George Renshaw . You 've no excuse ! As for the wimmen of the parish  --  if they 'd put more in the offertory and less on their backs it would fit themAN UNSUCCESSFUL CURATE 103better . " He thundered on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of his parishioners as he shoved the plate beneath their noses . His demands had provoked a feud , a bitter vendetta between himself and his parishioners . The more he berated them the less they gave . Enraged , he devised schemes , took to distributing little buff envelopes . When they left the empty envelopes behind he went round the church after the service , gathering up the litter and mutteringfuriously : " That 's how they treat Almighty God ! " In this gloomy financial sky there was one bright sun . Sir George Renshaw , who owned the Shalesley colliery , with , indeed , fifteen other coal mines in the county , was not only a man of immense resources and a Catholic but an inveterate philanthropist . Though his country seat , Renshaw Hall , was seventy miles away , on the other side of the shire , the Church of the Redeemer had somehow gained a place upon his list . Every Christmas , with the utmost regularity , a cheque for one hundred guineas reached the parish priest . " Guineas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not just measly pounds . Ah ! There 's a gentleman for ye ! " He had seen Sir George only twice , at public gatherings in Tynecastlemany years before , but he spoke of him with reverence and awe . He had a lurking fear that , through no fault of his , the magnatemight discontinue the charity . By the end of his first month at Shalesley , close association with Father Kezer began to take effect on Francis . He was continually on edge . No wonder young Father Lee had had such a bad nervous breakdown . His spiritual life became overcast , his sense of values confused . He found himself regarding Father Kezer with growing hostility . Then he would recollect himself with an inward groan , and strive wildly for obedience , for humility . His parochial work was desperately hard , particularly in this wintry weather . Three times a week he had to bicycle to Broughton and Glenburn , two distant wretched hamlets , to say mass , hear confessions , and take the catechism class in the local town hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties . Thevery children were lethargic , shuffling . There was much poverty , heartrending destitution ; the whole parish seemed steeped in apathy , savourless and stale . Passionately he told himself he would not surrender to routine . Conscious of his clumsiness and inefficiency , he had a burning desire to reach these poor hearts , to succour and revive them . He would kindle a spark , blaze the dead ashes into life , if it were the last thing he did . What made it worse was the fact that the parish priest , astute and watchful , seemed to sense , with a kind of grim humour , the difficulties his curate was experiencing , and to anticipate slyly a readjustmentof the other 's idealism to his own practical common sense . Once when Francis came in , tired and wet , having bicycled ten miles through wind and rain to an outlying sick call at Broughton , Father Kezer compressed his attitude into a single gibe . " Handingout halos is n't what you thought it was  --  eh ? " He added , naturally : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Christ died for a good-for-nothing lot . " Deeply upset , Francis began to mortify himself . At meals he ate sparingly , often only a cup of tea and some toast . Frequently , when he woke up in the middle of the night , tortured by misgivings , he would steal down to the church . Shadowed and silent , washed in pale moonlight , the bare edifice lost its distracting crudity . He flung himself down on his knees , begging for courage to embrace the tribulations of this beginning , praying with impetuous violence . At last , as he gazed at the wounded figure on the cross , patient , gentle , suffering , peace would fill his soul . One night , shortly after midnight , when he had made a visit of this nature and was tiptoeing upstairs , he found Father Kezer waiting on him . Wearing his nightshirt and an overcoat , a candle in his hand , the parish priest planted his thick hairy legs on the top landing , angrily barred the way . " What d' you think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Where have you been ? " " To the church . " " What ! At this time of night ! " " Why not ? " Francis forced a smile . " Do you think I might wake our Lord up ? " " No , but you might wake me up . " Father Kezer lost his temper . " I wo n't have it . I never heard such nonsense in my life . I 'm runninga parish , not a religious order . You can pray all you want in the day , but while you 're under my orders you 'll sleep at night . " Francis suppressed the hot answer on his tongue . He walked to his bedroom in silence . He must curb himself , make a great effort to get on with his superior , if he were to do any good in the parish at all . He tried to concentrate on Father Kezer 's good points : his frankness and courage , his odd jocularity , his adamantine chastity . A few days later , choosing a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest . " I 've been wondering , Father . . . we 've such a scattered district , so out of the way , with no proper places of amusement . . . wondering if we could n't have a club for the youngsters of the parish . " " Aha ! " Father Kezer was in his jocular mood . " So you 're out for popularity , my lad ! " " Good gracious , no . " Francis took up an equal heartiness , so intent was he on winning his point . " I do n't want to presume . But a club might take the young people off the streets  --  and the older ones out of the pubs . Develop them physically and socially . " He smiled . " Even make them want to come to church . " " Ho , ho ! " Father Kezer guffawed . " It 's well you 're young . I believe you 're worse than Lee . Well , go ahead if you want to . But you 'll get all your thanks in one basket from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you , thank you . I only wanted your permission . " With thrilling eagerness Francis immediately began to carry out his plan . Donald Kyle , the manager at Renshaw Colliery , was a Scot and a steady Catholic who had showed signs of good will . Two other officials at the pit , Morrison the check-weigher , whose wifeI06 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOMoccasionally came in to help at the Presbytery , and Creeden , the head shot-firer , were also members of the church . Through the manager , Francis received permission to use the Colliery first-aid hall three nights a week . With the help of the other two he set out to stir up interest in the proposed club . His own money , added up , made less than two pounds , and he would have died sooner than ask assistance from the parish . But he wrote to Willie Tulloch  --  whose work brought him into touch with the Tynecastle CorporationRecreation Centres  --  begging him to send along some old and cast-off athletic gear . Puzzling how he might best launch the venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than a dance . There was a piano in the room and Creeden was a first-rate performer on the fiddle . He posted up a notice on the Red Cross door , and when Thursday arrived , he expended his capital on a buffet of cakes , fruit and lemonade . The success of the evening , after a stiff start , surpassed his wildest expectations : so many turned out they managed eight sets of lancers . Most of the lads had no shoes , they danced in their pit boots . Betweenthe dances they sat on the benches round the room , red-faced and happy , while the girls went to the buffet to find them refreshment . When they waltzed they all sang the words of the refrain . A little group of pitmen going off shift gathered at the entrance , the gaslight showing their teeth white against their grimed faces . Towards the end they joined in the singing , and one or two of the brighter sparks amongst them nipped in and stole a dance . It was a merry evening . As he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ears , Francis thought with a surge of trembling joy : " They 've begun to come alive . Dear God , I 've made a start . " Next morning Father Kezer came in to breakfast in a towering rage . " What 's this I hear ? A fine to-do ! A right royal example . You ought to be ashamed of yourself . " Francis looked up in amazement . " What on earth do you mean ? " AN UNSUCCESSFUL CURATE I07 " You know what I mean ! That infernal stew you put on last night . " " You gave me permission  --  only a week ago . " Father Kezer snarled : " I did n't give you permission to start a promiscuous rigadoon on the very doorstep of my church . I 've had trouble enough to keep my young girls pure without your introducin ' your immodest pawing and prancing ! " " The entire evening was perfectly innocent . " " Innocent !  --  As God is above us ! " Father Kezer was dark red with anger . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to  --  you poor dolt  --  clutching and clasping and bodies and legs together ? It starts bad thoughts working in these young folks ' minds . It leads to concupiscence , carnality and lusts of the flesh . " Francis was very pale , his eyes were blazing with indignation . " Are n't you confusing lust with sex ? " " Holy St. Joseph ! What 's the difference ? " " As much as there is between disease and health . " Father Kezer 's hands made a convulsive gesture . " What in the foul fiend 's name are you talking about ? " The pent-up bitterness of the past two months broke over Francis in a tempestuous wave . " You ca n't suppress nature . If you do it 'll turn on you and rend you . It 's perfectly natural and good for young men and women to mix together , to dance together . It 's a natural prelude to courtship and marriage . You ca n't keep sex under a dirty sheet like a stinking corpse . That 's what starts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to educate and transmute sex , not choke it as though it were an adder . If you try that you 'll fail , besides making something filthy out of what is clean and fine ! " A horrible silence . The veins in Father Kezer 's neck were swollen , purple . " You blasphemous pup ! I 'll not have my young folks couplin ' in your dance halls ! " " Then you 'll drive them to couple  --  as you call it  --  in the dark lanes and fields . " " You lie , " Father Kezer stuttered . " I 'll keep the maidenhood of this parish undeflowered . I know what I 'm about . " AN UNSUCCESSFUL CURATE I09 With a great effort , he calmed himself . He thought : I 'll try , I must try . . . whenever Aunt Polly 's visit is over . He had arranged for Aunt Polly and Judy to come to Shalesley for a holiday during the last week in June . Shalesley , it is true , was not a health resort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fresh green of spring had touched its bleakness with a transient beauty . And Francis was particularly anxious that Polly should have the rest she so richly deserved . The winter had been hard for her , physically and financially . Thaddeus Gilfoyle was , in her own phrase , " ruining " the Union , drinking more than he sold , failing to show receipts , trying to get the remnants of the business into his own hands . Ned 's chronic illness had taken a peculiar turn , for twelve months now he had lost the power of his legs and was quite beyond business . Confined to a wheeled chair , he had lately become irresponsible and irrational . He had absurd delusions , spoke to the smirking , toadying Thaddeus of his steam yacht , his private brewery in Dublin . One day he had escaped her care and attended by Scanty  --  a grotesque spectacle of motion  --  had propelled himself to the Clermont shops and ordered himself two dozen hats . Dr. Tulloch , called in at Francis ' request , had pronounced Ned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain . It was he who had procured the male nurse who was now relieving Polly . Francis would have greatly preferred Judy and Aunt Polly to occupy the guest room at the Presbytery  --  indeed , one of his dreams was a parish of his own where Polly would be his housekeeper and Judy his particular charge . But Father Kezer 's attitude made a re- quest for hospitality out of the question . Francis found a comfort- able lodging for them at Mrs. Morrison 's . And on June 21st , Aunt Polly and Judy arrived . Welcoming them at the station , he felt a sudden pain in his heart . Polly , a stiff valiant figure , advanced from the train , leading by the hand , as she had led Nora , the small , dark , glossy-haired child . " Polly . Dear Polly . " He spoke as to himself . She was little " No doubt , " Francis answered bitterly . " But the fact remains that statistics show the Shalesley illegitimacy rate to be the highest in the diocese . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have a fit . His hands clenched and unclenched , as though seeking something to strangle . Rocking slightly on his feet , he raised his finger and levelled it at Francis . " Statistics 'll show another thing . And that is there 's no club within five miles of this spot I 'm standing on . Your fine plan is finished , smashed , done for . I say that ! And in this case my word is final ! " He flung himself down at the table and furiously began his breakfast . Francis finished quickly and went upstairs to his room , pale and shaken . Through the dusty panes he could see the first-aid room , with the packing case of boxing gloves and Indian clubs outside , which had arrived yesterday from Tulloch , all useless now , forbidden . A terrible emotion rose up in him . He thought rigidly : I can not continue to submit , God can not demand such subservience , I must fight , fight , on Father Kezer 's level , fight , not for myself , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an overflowinglove , an undreamed-of longing to help these poor people , his first charge from God . During the next few days , as he went through the routine of the parish , he sought feverishly for some means of lifting the ban upon his club . Somehow the club had become the symbol of the parish 's emancipation . But the more he dwelt upon it the more unassailable Father Kezer 's position appeared . Drawing his own conclusions from Francis ' quietness the older priest showed an ill-concealed jubilation . He was the one to tame them , to bring these young pups to heel . The Bishop must know how good he was to send him so many , one after the other . His sour grin broadened . Quite suddenly , Francis had an idea . It struck him with overwhelmingforce , a slender chance , perhaps , yet one which might succeed . His pale face coloured slightly , he almost cried out loud. changed , a trifle shabbier perhaps , her gaunt cheeks more drawn . She had the same short coat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on herself , always on others . She had cared for Nora and himself , for Ned and now for Judy . She was so utterly selfless , his breast filled . He stepped forward and hugged her . " Polly , I 'm so glad to see you . . . you 're . . . you 're eternal . " " Oh , dear . " She fumbled in her bag for her handkerchief . " It 's windy here . And there 's something in my eye . " He took her arm and Judy 's , and escorted them to their rooms . He did his utmost to give them a happy time . In the evenings he had long talks with Polly . Her pride in him , in what he had become , was touching . She made light of her troubles . But she admitted one anxiety  --  Judy was a problem . The child , now ten years of age and attending the day school at Clermont , was a queer mixture . Superficially she had an engaging frankness , but beneath she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odds and ends in her bedroom , and would shake with temper if they were disturbed . She had wild enthusiasms which quickly faded . In other moods she was timid and uncertain . She could not bear to admit a fault and would wander glibly from the truth to hide it . The hint that she was lying brought floods of indignanttears . With this before him Francis made every effort to win her confidence . He had her frequently to the Presbytery where , with the complete unconsciousness of the young , she made herself at home , often wandering off into Father Kezer 's room , climbing on his sofa , fingering his pipes and paperweights . It was embarrassing , but since the parish priest made no protest , Francis did not restrain the child . On the last day of their short holiday , when Aunt Polly had gone for a final walk and Judy had at length come to rest with a picture book in the corner of Francis ' room , a knock sounded on the door . It was Miss Cafferty . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately . " Francis ' brows lifted at the unexpected request . There was somethingominous in the housekeeper 's words . He rose , slowly . Father Kezer stood waiting in his own room . For the first time in weeks he looked straight at Francis . " That child is a thief . " Francis said nothing . But he felt a sudden hollow in his stomach . " I trusted her . I let her play about the place . I thought she was a nice little thing even though  --  " Kezer broke off angrily . " What has she taken ? " Francis said . His lips were stiff . " What do thieves usually take ? " Father Kezer swung round to the mantelpiece where a row of little pillars stood , each made up of twelve pennies , wrapped in white paper by his own careful hands . He picked one up . " She 's stolen from the collection money . It 's worse than thievery . It 's simony . Look at this . " Francis examined the packet . It had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pennies were missing . " What makes you think Judy did this ? " " I 'm not a fool , " Father Kezer snapped . " I 've been missing penniesall week . Every copper in these packets is marked . " Without a word Francis turned towards his own room . The parish priest followed him . " Judy . Show me your purse . " Judy looked as though she had been struck . But she recovered quickly . She smiled innocently . " I left it at Mrs. Morrison 's . " " No , here it is . " Francis bent forward and took the purse from the outside patch pocket of her dress . It was a new little strap purse which Aunt Polly had given her before the holiday . Francis opened it with a sinking heart . There were three pennies inside . Each had a cross scratched on the back . Father Kezer 's scowl was both outraged and triumphant . " What did I tell you ? Ah ! You wicked little brat , stealing from God ! " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this . If she were my responsibility I 'd march her straight down to the police . " " No , no . " Judy burst into tears . " I meant to put it back , truly , I did . " AN UNSUCCESSFUL CURATE I13he went direct to Donald Kyle 's house , took the manager aside , and talked to him with restrained intensity . Gradually a light broke over Kyle 's face , still dubious perhaps , but hopeful , aroused . He muttered , finally : " I doubt if we can do it ! But I 'm with ye all the way . " The two men shook hands . On Monday morning Father Kezer left for Harrogate where , for the next six weeks , he would drink the waters . That evening Miss Cafferty went off to her native Rosslare . And on Tuesday , early , Francis met Donald Kyle by appointment at the station . Kyle carried a portfolio of papers and a glossy new brochure recently issued by a large rival coal combine in Nottingham . He wore his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis ' . They took the eleven o'clock train from Shalesley . The long day passed slowly , they did not return until late eve- ning . They came up the road together in silence ; each looked straight ahead . Francis seemed tired , his expression revealed noth- ing . It was perhaps significant that the colliery manager smiled with grim solemnity as they said " Good night . " The next four days passed normally . Then , without warning , there began a period of strange activity . The activity seemed centred upon the colliery , not unnaturally , since the colliery was the centre of the district . Francis was there a good deal between the works of the parish , consulting with Donald Kyle , studying the architect 's blue prints , watching the squads of men at work . It was remarkable how quickly the new building grew . In a fortnight it had risen above the adjoining aid-room , in a month the structure was complete . Then the carpenters and plaster- rs came in . The sound of hammering fell exquisitely on Francis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shavings . Occasionally e set to and did a job with the men . They liked him . He had nherited from his father a fondness for working with his hands . Alone in the Presbytery , except for the unobtrusive daily visits of Mrs. Morrison , his temporary housekeeper , free of the nagging of is superior , his fervour knew no limits , a pure white glow per- aded him . He felt himself getting close to the people , breakingFrancis was very pale . The situation was horrible for him . He took his courage in both hands . " Very well , " he said quietly . " We 'll go down to the police station and charge her before Sergeant Hamilton straightaway . " Judy 's grief became hysterical . Father Kezer , taken aback , sneered : " I 'd like to see you . " Francis picked up his hat and took Judy 's hqnd . " Come along , Judy . You must be brave . We 're going down to Sergeant Hamilton to tell him Father Kezer charges you with stealing three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , confusion , then positive apprehension , flared up in Father Kezer 's eyes . He had let his tongue run away with him . Sergeant Hamilton , an Orangeman , was no friend of his : they had often clashed bitterly in the past . And now . . . this trivial charge . . . he saw himself jeered at all over the village . He mumbled suddenly :  --  " Ye need n't go ! " Francis did not seem to hear . " Stop ! " Father Kezer shouted . He fought down his temper , choked out : " We 'll . . . we 'll forget about it . Talk to her your-self . " He walked out of the room seething with rage . When Aunt Polly and Judy returned to Tynecastle , Francis had a quick revulsion : he wanted to explain , to express his regret for Judy 's petty pilfering . But Father Kezer froze him . A sense of being balked had further embittered the older man . Besides , he was shortly leaving on his vacation . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . He ignored Francis with tight-mouthed surliness . By arrangement with Miss Cafferty he took his meals alone , before the junior priest was served . On the Sunday before his departure , he preached a violent sermon , every word aimed at Francis , on the seventh commandment : " Thou shalt not steal . " The sermon decided Francis . Immediately the service was overI14 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOMdown suspicion , gradually entering their dulled lives , bringing to hidden stolid eyes a sudden startled gleam . It was a glorious sensation , a mingling of purpose and achievement , as though , embracing the poverty and wretchedness about him , he drew near in pity and soaring tenderness to the threshold of the unseen God . Five days before Father Kezer 's return , Francis sat down and wrote a letter . It ran as follows :  --  Shalesley , September 15th , 1897 . Dear Sir George , The new recreation centre which you have so generously donated to Shalesley Village is now practically complete . It should prove a tremendousboon , not only to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else in this scattered industrial district , irrespective of class or creed . A non-partisan committee has already been formed and a syllabus drawn up on the lines we discussed . From the copy I enclose you will see how comprehensive is our winter programme : boxing and singlestick classes , physical culture , first-aid instruction and a weekly dance every Thursday . When I consider the unhesitating liberality with which you met the diffident and perhaps unwarranted approach of Mr. Kyle and myself I am quite overwhelmed . Any words of gratitude which I might use would be hopelessly inadequate . Your real thanks will come from the happiness which you bring to the working people of Shalesley and from the good which must undoubtedly result from their increased social unity . We propose holding a gala opening night on September 21st . If you would consent to honour us with your presence our gratification would be complete .

Reinfusing the Presbytery with his loud , black , hairy essence , with his shouted greeting to Miss Cafferty , his deANUNSUCCESSFUL CURATE I15mand for substantial food , he ran through his correspondence . Then he bustled into lunch , rubbing his hands . On his plate lay an envelope . He ripped it open , drew out the printed card . " What 's this ? " Francis moistened his dry lips , mustered all his courage . " It appears to be an invitation to the opening night of the new Shalesley Athletic and Recreation Club . I 've had one too . " " Recreation Club . What 's that to us ! " Holding it at arm 's length , he glared redly at the card . " What is it ? " " A fine new centre . You can see it from the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The gift of Sir George Renshaw . " " Sir George . . . " Kezer broke off , stupefied , then stamped to the window . He gazed through the window , a long time , at the impressive proportions of the new erection . Then he returned , sat down and slowly began his lunch . His appetite was scarcely that of a man with a purified liver . He kept darting glances at Francis out of his small , lowering eyes . His silence blasted the room . At length Francis spoke  --  awkwardly , with tense simplicity . " You must decide , Father . You 've put a ban on dancing and all mixed recreation . On the other hand if our people do n't co-operate , ostracize the club , and stop away from the dances , Sir George will feel himself mortally insulted . " Francis kept his eyes on his plate . " He 's coming down , in person , on Thursday , for the opening . " Father Kezer could eat no more .

Do you hear me ? Once and for all , I 've said it ! " He rampaged out of the room . On the Thursday evening , freshly shaved , in clean linen and his best black , his face a dreadful compromise of gaiety and gloom , Father Kezer stalked over to the ceremony . Francis followed behind him . The new hall was warm with lights and excitement , filled to capacity with the working people of the community . On the raised platform a number of the local notables were seated , Donald KyleI16 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOMand his wife , the colliery doctor , the council schoolmaster , and two other ministers of religion . As Francis and Father Kezer took their seats there was prolonged cheering , then a few catcalls and loud laughter . Father Kezer 's jaws snapped sourly together . The sound of a car arriving outside heightened the expectation and a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the platform . He was a medium-sized man of about sixty with a shining bald head fringed with white hair . His moustache was silvery also , and his cheeks were brightly coloured . He had that remarkably fresh pink-and-whiteness achieved by some fair-haired persons in their declining years . It seemed preposterous that one so quiet in his dress and manner should command such enormous power . He listened agreeably while the ceremony proceeded , sustained the address of welcome from Mr. Kyle , then delivered a few remarkshimself . He concluded amiably : " I should like in fairness to state that the first suggestion of this very worthy project came directly from the vision and broadmindednessof Father Francis Chisholm . " The applause was deafening and Francis flushed , his eyes , pleadingand remorseful , bent on his superior . Father Kezer raised his hands automatically , brought them soundlesslytogether twice , with a grin of sickly martyrdom . Later , when the impromptu dance started , he stood watching Sir George swing round the hall with young Nancy Kyle . Then he faded into the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis returned , late , he found the parish priest sitting up in the parlour , with no fire , his hands on his knees . Father Kezer seemed oddly inert . All the fight had gone out of him . In the last ten years he had knocked out more curates than Henry VIII had wives . And now a curate had knocked him out . He said tonelessly :  --  " I 'll have to report you to the Bishop ! " Francis felt his heart turn over in his breast . But he did not flinch . No matter what happened to him , Father Kezer 's authority wasAN UNSUCCESSFUL CURATE I17shaken . The older priest continued glumly : " Perhaps you 'd be the better of a change . The Bishop can decide . Dean Fitzgerald needs another curate in Tynecastle . . . your friend Mealey 's there , is n't he ? " Francis was silent . He did not wish to leave this now faintly stirring parish . Yet even if he were forced to do so things would be easier for his successor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other changes would come . He had no personal exultation , but a quiet , almost visionary , hope . He said in a low voice : " I 'm sorry if I have upset you , Father . Believe me , I was only trying to help . . . our good-for-nothing lot . " The eyes of the two priests met . Father Kezer 's fell first . IIONE Friday towards the end of Lent , in the dining room of St. Dominic 's Presbytery , Francis and Father Slukas were already seated at the meagre midday repast of boiled stock-fish and butterlessbrown toast served on Victorian silver and fine blue Worcester china , when Father Mealey returned from an early sick call . From the suppression of his manner , his indifferent mode of helping himself , Francis was immediately aware that Anselm had something on his mind . Dean Fitzgerald dined upstairs at this season of the Church and the three junior priests were alone . But Father Mealey , munching without taste , a faint colour beneath his skin , kept silence till the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crumbs from his beard , risen , bowed , and departed , did his tension relax . He drew a long pressing breath . " Francis ! I want you to come with me this afternoon . You 've no engagements ? " " No . . . I 'm free till four o'clock . " " Then you must come . I 'd like you as my friend , as my fellow priest , to be the first . . . " He broke off , would say no more to lift the heavy mystery of his words . II8 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOM I AN UNSUCCESSFUL CURATE 119For two years Francis had been the second curate at St. Dominic 's , where Gerald Fitzgerald , now Dean Fitzgerald , still remained , with Anselm his senior assistant and Slukas , the Lithuanian Father , a necessary encumbrance on account of the many Polish immigrants who kept crowding into Tynecastle . The change from the backwoods of Shalesley to this familiar city parish where the services went like clockwork and the church was elegantly perfect had left a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Aunt Polly , to maintain an eye on Ned and Judy , to see the Tullochs , Willie and his sister , once or twice a week . He had a queer consolation , a sense of indefinable support , in the recent elevation of Monsignor MacNabb from San Morales to be Bishop of the diocese . Yet his new air of maturity , the lines about his steady eyes , the spareness of his frame , gave silent indications that the transition had not been easy . Dean Fitzgerald , refined and fastidious , priding himself on being a gentleman , stood at the opposite pole from Father Kezer . Yet , though he strove to be impartial , the Dean was not without a certainlofty prejudice . While he warmly approved Anselm  --  now his prime favourite  --  and blankly ignored Father Slukas ,  --  whose broken English and table habits , a napkin tucked beneath the beard at every meal , coupled with a strange predilection for wearing a derby hat with his soutane , placed him far beyond the pale ,  --  towards his other curate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his humble birth , his association with the Union Tavern , with , indeed , the whole stark Bannon tragedy , must prove a handicap he could not lightly overcome . And he had made such a bad beginning ! Tired of the shopworn platitudes , the same old parrot sermons that came , almost by rote , on the appointed Sundays of the year , Francis had ventured , soon after his arrival , to preach a simple homily , fresh and original , his own thoughts , on the subject of personal integrity . Alas , Dean Fitzgeraldhad cuttingly condemned the dangerous innovation . Next Sunday , at his behest , Anselm had mounted the pulpit and given forth the antidote : a magnificent peroration on The Star of the Sea , in which harts panted for the water and barques came safe across the bar ; ending dramatically with arms outstretched , a handsome suppliant for Love , on the admonition : " Come ! " All the women of the congregation were in tears , and afterwards , as Anselm ate a hearty breakfast of mutton chops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Mealey  --  was eloquent . I heard our late Bishop deliver practically the same sermon twenty years ago . " Perhaps these opposite orations set their courses : as the months passed Francis could not but dejectedly compare his own indifferent showing with Anselm 's remarkable success . Father Mealey was a figure in the parish , always cheerful , even gay , with a ready laugh and a comforting pat on the back for anyone in trouble . He worked hard and with great earnestness , carrying a little book full of his engagements in his waistcoat pocket , never refusing an invitation to address a meeting or make an after-dinner speech . He edited the St. Dominic 's Gazette : a newsy and often humorous little sheet . He went out a good deal and , though no one could call him a snob , took tea at all the best houses . Whenever an eminent cleric came to preach in the city , Anselm was sure to meet him and to sit admiringly at his feet . Later he would send a letter , beautifully composed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounter . He had made many influential friends through this sincerity . Naturally there were limits to his capacity for work . While he vigorously assumed the post of secretary to the new Diocesan ForeignMissionary Centre in Tynecastle  --  a cherished project of the Bishop  --  and worked unremittingly to please His Grace , he had been obliged reluctantly to decline , and depute to Francis , the management of the Working Boy 's Club in Shand Street . The property round Shand Street was the worst in the city , tall tenements and lodging houses , a network of slums , and this , properlyenough , had come to be regarded as Francis ' district . Here , though his results seemed trivial and meaningless , he found plentyto do . He had to train himself to look destitution in the eye , to vie%without shrinking the sorrow and the shame of life , the eternalI20 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOM AN UNSUCCESSFUL CURATE I2Iirony of poverty . It was not a communion of saints that grew about him but a communion of sinners , rousing such pity in him it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't say you 're taking forty winks , " said Anselm reproachfully . Almost with a start Francis came out of his reverie to find Father Mealey , waiting on him , hat and stick in hand , beside the lunch table . He smiled and rose in acquiescence . Outside , the afternoon was fresh and fine , with a rousing , bustling breeze , and Anselm strode along with a brisk swing , clean , honest and healthy , greeting his parishioners bluffly . His popularity at St. Dominic 's had not spoiled him . To his many admirers his most engaging characteristic was the way in which he deprecated his achievements . Soon Francis saw that they were making for the new suburb recentlyadded to the parish . Beyond the city boundary , a housing developmentwas in progress , on the parklands of an old country property . Workmen were moving with hods and barrows . Francis subconsciously noted a big white board : Hollis Estate , Apply Malcom Glennie , Solicitor . But Anselm was pushing on , over the hill , past some green fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a pleasant rural stretch to be so near the chimney-pots . Suddenly Father Mealey halted , with the still excitement of a pointing hound . " You know where we are , Francis ? You 've heard of this place ? " " Of course . " Francis had often passed it : a little hollow of lichened rocks , screened with yellow broom and enclosed by an oval copse of copper beeches . It was the prettiest spot for miles around . He had often wondered why it was known as " The Well " and sometimes , indeed , as " Marywell . " The basin had been dry for fifty years . " Look ! " Clutching his arm , Father Mealey led him forward . From the dry rocks gushed a crystal spring . There was an odd silence , then , stooping with cupped hands , Mealey took an almost sacramental drink . " Taste it , Francis . We ought to be grateful for the privilege of being among the first . " Francis bent and drank . The water was sweet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mealey regarded him with wise indulgence , not without its tinge of patronage . " My dear fellow , I could call it a heavenly taste . " " Has it been flowing long ? " " It began yesterday afternoon at sundown . " Francis laughed . " Really , Anselm , you 're a Delphic oracle today  --  full of signs and portents . Come on , give me the whole story . Who told you about this ? " Father Mealey shook his head . " I ca n't . . . yet . " " But you 've made me so confoundedly curious . " Pleased , Anselm smiled . Then his expression regained its solemnity . " I ca n't break the seal yet , Francis . I must go to Dean Fitzgerald . He 's the one who must deal with this . Meantime , of course , I trust you . . . I know you will respect my confidence . " Francis knew his companion too well to press him further . On their return to Tynecastle , Francis parted from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sick call . One of his club members , a boy named Owen Warren , had been kicked on the leg in a football game some weeks before . The youngster was poor and undernourished and heedless of the injury . When the Poor Law doctor was eventually called in , the condition had developed into an ugly ulcer of the shin . The affair had upset Francis  --  the more so since Dr. Tulloch seemed dubious of the prognosis . And this evening , in his endeavourto bring some comfort to Owen and his worried mother , the peculiar and inconclusive excursion of the afternoon was driven completely from his mind . Next morning , however , loud and minatory sounds emerging from Dean Gerald Fitzgerald 's room brought it back before him . Lent was a deadly penance for the Dean . He was a just man , and he fasted . But fasting did not suit his full elegant body , well habituated to the stimuli of rich and nourishing juices . Sorely triedI22 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOM in health and temper , he kept to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooded eye , and each night marked an- other cross upon the calendar . Although Father Mealey stood so high in Fitzgerald 's favour it demanded considerable resourcefulness to approach him at such a time , and Francis heard Anselm 's voice fall , persuasive and plead- ing , across the Dean 's irascible abruptness . In the end the softer voice triumphed  --  like drops of water , Francis reflected , wearing out granite through sheer persistence . An hour later , with a very bad grace , the Dean came out of his room . Father Mealey was waiting on him in the vestibule . They departed together in a cab in the direction of the centre of the town . They were absent three hours . It was lunchtime when they returned and for once the Dean broke his rule . He sat down at the curate 's table . Though he would eat nothing he ordered a large pot of French coffee , his one luxury in a desert of self-denial . Sitting side- ways , his legs crossed , a handsome elegant figure , sipping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmth , almost of corn- radeship , as though a little taken out of himself by an inner , thrill- ing exaltation . He said , meditatively , to Francis and the Polish priest  --  it was notable that he included Slukas in his friendly glance :  --  " Well , we may thank Father Mealey for his persistence . . . in the face of my somewhat violent disbelief . Naturally it is my duty to maintain the utmost scepticism towards certain . . . phenomena . But I have never seen , I had never hoped to see , such a manifesta- tion , in my own parish  --  " He broke off and , taking up his coffee cup , made a generous gesture of renunciation towards the senior curate . " Let it be your privilege to tell them , Father . " That faint excited colour persisted in Father Mealey 's cheek . He cleared his throat and began , readily and earnestly , as though the incident he related demanded his most formal eloquence :  --  " One of our parishioners , a young woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out walking on Monday of this week . The date , since we wish above everything to be precise , was March ' - Jfifteenth , and the time , half-past three in the afternoon . The reason for her excursion was no idle one  --  this girl is a devout and fervent soul not given to giddiness or loitering . She was walking in accordance with her doctor 's instructions  --  to get some fresh air  --  the medical man being Dr. William Brine of 42 Boyle Crescent , whom we all know as a physician of unimpeachable , I might say , of the highest , integrity . Well ! " Father Mealey took a tense gulp of water and went on . " As she was returning from her walk , murmuring a prayer , she chanced to pass the place which we know as Mary 's Well . It was twilight , the last rays of the sun lingering in pure radiance upon the lovely scene . This young girl stopped to gaze and admire when suddenly to her wonder and surprise she saw standing before her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diadem of stars upon her forehead . Guided by holy instinct our Catholic girl immediately fell upon her knees . The lady smiled to her with ineffable tenderness and said : My child , sickly though you are , you are the one to be chosen ! ' Then , half-turning , still addressingthe awestruck yet comprehending girl : Is it not sad that this Well which bears my name is dry ? Remember ! It is for you and those like you that this shall happen . ' With a last beautiful smile she disappeared . At that instant a fount of exquisite water sprang from the barren rock . " There was a silence when Father Mealey concluded . Then the Dean resumed : " As I have said , our approach to this delicate matter was made in the frankest incredulity . We do n't expectmiracles to grow on every gooseberry bush . Young girls are notoriously romantic . And the starting of the spring might have been a sheer coincidence . However  --  " His tone took on a deeper gratification . " I 've just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Mealey and Dr. Brine . As you may imagine , the solemn experience of her vision was a great shock to her . She went to bed immediately after it and has remained there ever since . " The voice became slower , fraught with immense significance . " Though she is happy , normal and physically well-nourished , in these five days she has touched neither food nor drink . " He gave124 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOMthe amazing fact its due weight in silence . " Moreover . . . moreover , I say , she shows plainly , unmistakably and irrefutably , the blessed stigmata ! " He went on triumphantly : " While it is too early to speak yet , while final evidence must be collected , I have the strongest premonition , amounting almost to conviction , that we in this parish have been privileged by Almighty God to participate in a miracle comparable to , and perhaps far-reaching as , those which gave our holy religion the new-found Grotto at Digby and the older and more historic Shrine at Lourdes . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his peroration . " Who is the girl ? " Francis asked . " She is Charlotte Neily ! " Francis stared at the Dean . He opened his lips and closed them again . The silence remained impressive . The next few days brought a growing excitement to the Presbytery . No one could have been better equipped to deal with the crisis than Dean Gerald Fitzgerald . A man of sincere devotion , he was wise also in worldly ways . Long and hard-won experience on the local school board and urban councils gave him an astute approach to temporal affairs . No news of the event was permitted to escape , not a whisper , even , in the parochial halls . The Dean had everythingunder his own hand . He would raise his hand only when he was ready . The incident , so miraculously unexpected , was a breath of new life to him . Not for many years had he known such inner satisfaction : both spiritual and material . He was a strange mixture of piety and ambition . His exceptional attributes of mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for advancement in the Church . And he longed passionately for that advancement as much , perhaps , as he longed for the advancement of Holy Church herself . A keen student of contemporary history , he likened himself often in his own mind to Newman . He merited equal eminence . Yet he remained , becalmed , at St. Dominic 's . The only preferment theyAN UNSUCCESSFUL CURATE 125had given him , the reward of twenty distinguished years , was this petty elevation to the rank of Dean , an infrequent title in the CatholicChurch and one which often embarrassed him on his journeyingbeyond the city , causing him to be mistaken for an Anglican clergyman , an inference he most cordially resented . Perhaps he realized that while he was admired he was not liked . With the passage of each day he was growing more and more a disappointed man . He strove for resignation . Yet when he bent his head and said " 0 Lord , Thy will be done ! " deep down beneath his humility was the burning thought : " By this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything was changed . Let them keep him at St. Dominic 's . He would make St. Dominic 's a shrine of light . Lourdes was his exemplar and , nearer in time and space , the recent striking instance of Digby in the Midlands , where the foundation of a miraculous grotto , with many authenticated cures , had transformed the dreary hamlet into a thriving town , and elevated , at the same time , an unknown but resourceful parish priest to the status of a national figure . The Dean sank into a splendid vision of a new city , a great basilica , a solemn triduum , himself enthroned in stiff vestments .. . then sharply took himself in hand and scrutinized the draft contracts . His first action had been to place immediately a Dominican nun , Sister Teresa , trustworthy and discreet , in Charlotte Neily 's home . Reassured by her impeccable reports he had taken to the law . It was fortunate that Marywell and all the land adjacent formed the estate of the old and wealthy Hollis family . Though not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Renshaw 's sister . He was friendly and well-disposed . He and his solicitor , Malcom Glennie , were closeted with the Dean upon successive days , holding long conferences over sherry and biscuits . A fair and amicable arrangement was at length worked out . The Dean had no personal interest in money . He regarded it contemptuously as so much dross . But the things that money could purchase were important and he must ensure the future of his shining project . No oneI26 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOMbut a fool could fail to realize that the value of the land would rocket to the sky . On the last day of the negotiations Francis ran into Glennie in the upper corridor . Frankly , he was surprised to find Malcom dealingwith the Hollis affairs . But the solicitor , when articled , had shrewdly bought himself into an old established firm with his wife 's money , and quietly succeeded to some first-rate practice . " Well , Malcom ! " Francis held out his hand . " Glad to see you again . " Glennie shook hands with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis smiled , " to find you in the house of the Scarlet Woman ! " The solicitor 's answering smile was thin . He mumbled : " I 'm a liberal man , Francis . . . besides being obliged to chase the pen-nies . " There was a silence . Francis had often thought to restore his relationship with the Glennies . But news of the death of Daniel had dissuaded him  --  and a chance encounter with Mrs. Glennie in Tynecastle when , as he crossed the street to greet her , she had sighted him from the corner of her eye , and shied away , as though she spied the Devil . He said : " It made me very sad to hear of your father 's death . " " Ay , ay ! We miss him of course . But the old man was such a failure . " " It 's no great failure to get into heaven , " Francis joked . " Well , yes , I suppose he 's there . " Glennie vaguely twisted the emblem on his watchchain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his figure slack , shoulders and stomach pendulous , his thin hair plastered in streaks over his bare scalp . But his eye , though palely evasive , was gimlet sharp . As he moved towards the stairs he threw off a tepid invitation . " Look us up when you have time . I 'm married , as you know  --  two of a family  --  but Mother still lives with us . " Malcom Glennie had his own peculiar interest in the beatific vision of Charlotte Neily . Since his early youth he had been paANUNSUCCESSFUL CURATE 127tiently seeking an opportunity to acquire wealth . He inherited from his mother a burning avarice and something of her long-nosed cunning . He smelled money in this ridiculous Romish scheme . Its very uniqueness convinced him of its possibilities . His opportunity was here , dangling like a ripe fruit . It would never occur again , never in a lifetime . Working disingenuously for his client , Malcom remembered what everyone else had forgotten . Secretly , and at considerable expense , he had a geological survey carried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected . The flow of water to the property came exclusively through an upper tract of heath land , above and remote from the estate . Malcom was not rich . Not yet . But by taking all his savings , by mortgaging his house and business , he had just enough to execute a three months ' option on this land . He knew what an artesian bore would do . That bore would never be driven . But a bargain would be driven , later , on the threat of that bore , which would make Malcom Glennie a landed gentleman . Meanwhile the water still gushed clear and sweet . Charlotte Neily still maintained her rapture and her stigmata , still existed without sustenance . And Francis still prayed , broodingly , for the gift of faith . If only he could believe like Anselm who , without a struggle , blandly , smilingly , accepted everything from Adam 's rib to the less probable details of Jonah 's sojourn in the whale ! He did believe , he did , he did . . . but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by an effort of love , by keeping his nose to the grindstone in the slums , when shaking the fleas from his clothing into the empty bath . . . never , never easily . . . except when he sat with the sick , the crippled , those of stricken , ashen countenance . The cruelty of this present test , its unfairness , was wrecking his nerves , withering in him the joy of prayer , It was the girl herself who disturbed him . Doubtless he was prejudiced : he could not overlook the fact that Charlotte 's mother was Thaddeus Gilfoyle 's sister . And her father was a vague and128 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOM AN UNSUCCESSFUL CURATE I29windy character , pious yet lazy , who stole away from his small chandler 's premises every day , to light candles before the side altar for success in his neglected business . Charlotte had all her father 's fondness for the Church . But Francis had a worried suspicion that the incidentals drew her , the smell of incense and of candle grease , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did not deny her unblemished goodness , the regularity with which she carried out her duties . As against that , she washed sketchily , and her breath was rancid . On the following Saturday as Francis walked down Glanville Street , feeling absurdly depressed , he observed Dr. Tulloch come out of Number 193 , the house of Owen Warren . He called , the doctor turned , stopped , then fell into step beside his friend . Willie had broadened with the years , but had otherwise changed little . Slow , tenacious and canny , loyal to his friends , hostile to his enemies , he had , in manhood , all his father 's honesty , but little of his charm and nothing of his looks . His blunt-nosed face was red and stolid , topped by a shock of unmanageable hair . He had an air of plodding decency . His medical career had not been brilliant , but he was sound and enjoyed his work . He was quite contemptuous of all orthodox ambitions . Though he spoke occasionally of " seeing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he remained in his Poor Law appointment  --  which demanded no hateful bedside falsities and enabled him at most times to speak his mind  --  anchored by the humdrum , by his matter-of-fact capacity of living from day to day . Besides , he never could save money . His salary was not large ; and much of it was spent on whiskey . Always careless of his appearance , this morning he had not shaved . And his deepset eyes were sombre , his expression unusually put out : as though today he had a grudge against the world . He indicated briefly that the Warren boy was worse . He had been in to take a shred of tissue for pathological examination . They continued along the street , linked by one of their peculiar silences . Suddenly , on an unaccountable impulse , Francis divulged the story of Charlotte Neily . Tulloch 's face did not change , he trudged along , fists in his deep coat pockets , collar up , head down . " Yes , " he said at last . " A little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it ? " " Why ask me ? " " At least you 're honest . " Tulloch looked oddly at Francis . For one so modest , so conscious of his mental limitations , the doctor 's rejection of the myth of God was strangely positive . " Religion is n't my province , I inherited a most satisfying atheism . . . which the anatomy room confirmed . But if you want it straight  --  in my old dad 's words , I have my doubts . See here , though ! Why do n't we take a look at her ? We 're not far from the house . We 'll go in together . " " Wo n't that get you into trouble with Dr. Brine ? " " No . I can square it with Salty tomorrow . In dealing with my colleagues I find it pays to act first and apologize afterwards . " He threw Francis a singular smile . " Unless you 're afraid of the hier-archy ? " Francis flushed but controlled his answer . He said a minute later : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go in . " It proved surprisingly easy to effect an entrance . Mrs. Neily , worn-out by a night of watching , was asleep . Neily , for once , was at his business . Sister Teresa , short , quiet and amiable , opened the door . Since she came from a distant section of Tynecastle she had no knowledge of Tulloch , but she knew and recognized Francis , at once . She admitted them to the polished , immaculately tidy room where Charlotte lay on spotless pillows , washed and clothed in a high white nightgown , the brasses of the bedstead shining . Sister Teresa bent over the girl , not a little proud of her stainless handiwork . " Charlotte , dear . Father Chisholm has come to see you . And brought a doctor who is a great friend of Dr. Brine . " Charlotte Neily smiled . The smile was conscious , vaguely languid , yet charged with curious rapture . It lit up the pale , already luminous face , motionless upon the pillow . It was deeply impressive . Francis130 THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no doubt that some- thing existed , here , in this still white room , outside the bonds of natural experience . " You do n't mind if I examine you , Charlotte ? " Tulloch spoke kindly . At his tone , her smile lingered . She did not move . She had the cushioned repose of one who is watched , who knows that she is watched , yet is undisturbed , rather exalted , by such watching : a consciousness of inner power , a mollification , a dreamy and elevated awareness of the deference and reverence evoked amongst the watchers . Her pale eyelids fluttered . Her voice was untroubled , remote . " Why should I mind , doctor ? I 'm only too glad . I 'm not worthy to be chosen as God 's vessel . . . but since I am chosen I can only joyfully submit . " She allowed the respectful Tulloch to examine her . " You do n't eat anything , Charlotte ? " " No , doctor . " " You 've no appetite ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem sustained by an inner grace . " Sister Teresa said quietly : " I can assure you she has n't put a bite in her mouth since I came into this house . " A silence fell in the hushed white room . Dr. Tulloch straightened himself , pushing back his unruly hair . He said simply :  --  " Thank you , Charlotte . Thank you , Sister Teresa . I 'm much indebted to you for your kindness . " He went towards the bedroom door . As Francis made to follow the doctor a shadow fluttered over Charlotte 's face . " Do n't you want to see too , Father ? Look . . . my hands ! My feet are just the same . " She extended both her arms , gently , sacrificially . Upon both her pale palms , unmistakably , were the blood-stained marks of nails . Outside , Dr. Tulloch maintained his attitude of reserve . He kept his lips shut until they reached the end of the street . Then , at the point where their ways diverged , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here it is . A borderline case  --  or just over : manic depressive in the exalted stage . Certainly a hysteric bleeder . If she steers clear of the asylum , she 'll probably be canonized ! " His composure , his perfect manner left him . His red plain face became congested . His words choked him . " Damn it to hell ! When I think of her trigged up there in her simpering holiness , like an ana:mic angel in a flour bag  --  and little Owney Warren , stuck in a dirty garret , with worse pain than your hellfire in his gangrenous leg , and the threat of malignant sarcoma over him , I could just about explode . Bite on that when you say your prayers . You 're probably going back to say them now . Well , I 'm going home to have a drink . " He walked rapidly away before Francis could reply . That same evening when Francis returned from tenebrae an urgent summons awaited him , written on the slate which hung in the Presbytery vestibule . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study . The Dean was wearing out his temper and his carpet with short exasperated paces . " Father Chisholm ! I am both amazed and indignant . Really , I expected better of you than this . To think that you should bring in  --  from the streets  --  an atheistic doctor  --  I resent it violently ! " " I 'm sorry . " Francis answered heavily . " It 's just  --  oh , well , he happens to be my friend . " " That in itself is highly reprehensible . I find it wildly improper that one of my curates should associate with a character like Dr. Tulloch . " " We . . . we were boys together . " " That is no excuse . I 'm hurt and disappointed . I 'm thoroughly and justifiably incensed . From the very beginning your attitude towards this great event has been cold and unsympathetic . I daresayyou are jealous that the honour of the discovery should have fallen to the senior curate . Or is there some deeper motive behind your manifest antagonism ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt that the Dean was right . He mumbled :  --  i132 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOM " I 'm terribly sorry . I 'm not disloyal . That 's the last in the world I 'd want to be . But I admit I 've been lukewarm . It 's because I 've been troubled . That 's why I took Tulloch in today . I have such doubts  --  " " Doubts ! Do you deny the miracles of Lourdes ? " " No , no . They 're unimpeachable . Authenticated by doctors of all creeds . " " Then why deny us the opportunity to create another monument of faith  --  here  --  in our very midst ? " The Dean 's brow darkened . " If you disregard the spiritual implications , at least respect the physical . " He sneered . " Do you fondly imagine that a young girl can go nine days without food or drink  --  and remain well and perfectly nourished  --  unless she is receiving other sustenance ? " " What sustenance ? " " Spiritual sustenance . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive a spiritual mystic drink which supplanted all earthly food ? Such insufferable doubting ! Can you wonder that I lose my temper ? " Francis hung his head . " Saint Thomas doubted . In the presence of all the disciples . Even to putting his fingers in our Lord 's side . But no one lost their temper . " There was a sudden shocked pause . The Dean paled , then recoveredhimself . He bent over his desk , fumbling at some papers , not looking at Francis . He said in a restrained tone :  --  " This is not the first time you have proved obstructive . You are getting yourself into very bad odour in the diocese . You may go . " Francis left the room with a dreadful sense of his own deficiencies . He had a sudden overwhelming impulse to take his troubles to Bishop MacNabb . But he suppressed it . Rusty Mac seemed no longer approachable . He would be too fully occupied by his new high office to concern himself with the worries of a wretched curate . Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dean Fitzgeraldbroke the news in the finest sermon he had ever preached . The sensation was immediate and tremendous . The entire congregationstood outside the church talking in hushed voices , unANUNSUCCESSFUL CURATE 133willing to go home . A spontaneous procession formed up and departed , under the leadership of Father Mealey , for Marywell . In the afternoon crowds collected outside the Neily home . A band of young women of the confraternity , to which Charlotte belonged , knelt in the street reciting the rosary . In the evening the Dean consented to be interviewed by a highly curious press . He conducted himself with dignity and restraint . Already esteemed in the city , rated as a public-spirited clergyman , he produced a most favourable impression . Next morning the newspapers gave him generously of their space . He was on the front page of the Tribune , had a eulogistic double spread inside the Globe . " Another Digby , " proclaimed the Northumberland Herald . Said the Yorkshire Echo , " Miraculous Grotto Brings Hope to Thousands . " The Weekly High Anglican hedged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the London Times was superb with a scholarly article from its theological correspondent tracing the history of the Well back to Aidan and Saint Ethelwulf . The Dean flushed with gratification . Father Mealey could eat no breakfast , and Malcom Glennie was beside himself with joy . Eight days later Francis paid an evening visit to Polly 's little flat in Clermont , at the north end of the city . He was tired , after a long day 's visiting in the dingy tenements of his district , and most desperately depressed . That afternoon a note had come round from Dr. Tulloch which curtly signed young Warren 's death warrant . The condition had been revealed as malignant sarcoma of the leg . There was no hope whatsoever for the boy : he was dying and might not last the month . At Clermont , Polly was her indomitable self , Ned , perhaps , a trifle more trying than usual . Hunched in his wheeled chair , a blanket wrapped about his knees , he talked much and rather foolishly . Some sort of final settlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the remnants of Ned 's interest in the Union Tavern . A pitiful sum . But Ned had boasted as though it were a fortune . As the result of his complaint his tongue seemed too large for his mouth , he was distressingly inarticulate. 134 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOMJudy was already asleep when Francis arrived , and although Polly said nothing there was a hint in her manner that the child had misbehaved and been sent off early . The thought saddened him further . Eleven o'clock was striking when he left the flat . The last tram to Tynecastle had gone . Tramping home , his shoulders drooping slightly under this final discomfiture , he entered Glanville Street . As he drew opposite the Neily home he observed that the double window on the ground floor , which marked Charlotte 's room , was still illuminated . He made out the movements of figures , vague shadows on the yellow blind . A rush of contrition overcame him . Oppressed by the realization of his obduracy , he had a sudden desire to see the Neilys and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as he crossed the street and went up the three front steps . He raised his hand towards the knocker , altered his mind and turned the oldfashionedhandle of the door . He had acquired that facility , common to priests and physicians , of making his sick visits unannounced . The bedroom , opening off the small lobby , projected a wide slant of gaslight . He tapped gently on the lintel and entered the room . Then he stood , suddenly transformed to stone . Charlotte , propped up in bed , with an oval tray before her laden with breast of chicken and a custard , was stuffing herself with food . Mrs. Neily , wrapped in a faded blue dressing gown , bent with solicitude , was noiselessly decanting stout . It was the mother who saw Francis first . Arrested , she gave a neighing cry of terror . Her hand flew to her throat , dropping the glass , spilling the stout upon the bed . Charlotte raised her gaze from the tray . Her pale eyes dilated . She gazed at her mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slid down on the bed , shielding her face . The tray crashed on to the floor . No one had spoken . Mrs. Neily 's throat worked convulsively . She made a stupid , feeble effort to secrete the bottle in her dressing gown . At last she gasped : " I 've got to keep herAN UNSUCCESSFUL CURATE 135strength up somehow . . . all she 's been through . . . it 's invalid 's stout ! " Her look of frightened guilt revealed everything . It sickened him . He felt debased and humiliated . He had difficulty in finding words . " I suppose you 've given her food every night . . . when Sister left her , thinking she was asleep ? " " No , Father ! As God is my witness ! " She made a last desperate attempt at denial , then broke down , lost her head completely . " What if I did ? I could n't see my poor child starve , not for nobody . But dear Saint Joseph . . . I 'd never have let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much . . . with the crowds . . . and the papers ... I 'm glad to be through with it . . . . Do n't . . . do n't be hard on us , Father . " He said in a low voice : " I 'm not going to judge you , Mrs. Neily . " She wept . He waited patiently until her sobs subsided , seated on a chair at the door , gazing at his hat , between his hands . The folly of what she had done , the folly , at that moment , of all human life , appalled him . When the two were quieter he said : " Tell me about it . " The story came , gulped out , mostly by Charlotte . She had read such a nice book , from the church library , about Blessed Bernardette . One day when she was passing Marywell , it was her favourite walk , she noticed the water running . That 's funny , she thought . Then the coincidence struck her , between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had almost , in a sort of way , fancied she saw the Blessed Virgin . When she got home , the more she thought of it the surer she became . It gave her quite a turn . She was all white and trembling , she had to take to her bed and send for Father Mealey . And before she knew where she was , she was telling him the whole story . All that night she 'd lain in a kind of ecstasy , her body seemed to go rigid , stiff as a board . Next morning , when she woke up , the marks were there . She 'd always bruised terrible but these were different . Well , that convinced her . All that day , when food came , she136 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOM AN UNSUCCESSFUL CURATE 137 refused it , just waved it away . She was too happy , too excited to eat . Besides , lots of Saints had lived without food . That idea fixed itself on her , too . When Father Mealey and the Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too  --  it was a glorious feeling . The attention she had , it was like she was a bride . But of course , after a bit , she got dreadfully hungry . She could n't disap- point Father Mealey and the Dean : the way she was looked up to by Father Mealey especially . She just told her mother . And things had gone so far her mother had to help her . She had a big meal , sometimes two , every night . But then , oh , dear , things had gone even further . " At first , as I told you , Father , it was wonderful . The best of all was the con- fraternity girls praying to me outside the window ! " But when the newspapers started and all that , she got really frightened . She wished to God she had never done it . Sister Teresa was harder to pull the wool over . The marks on her hands were getting faint , instead of being all lifted up and excited she was turning low , depressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitiful revelation  --  tawdry as an illiterate scrawl upon a wall . Yet tragic , somehow , with the idiocy of all humanity . The mother interposed . " You wo n't tell Dean Fitzgerald on us , will you , Father ? " Francis was no longer angry , only sad and strangely merciful . If only the wretched business had not gone so far . He sighed . " I wo n't tell him , Mrs. Neily , I wo n't say a word . But  --  " He paused . " I 'm afraid you must . " Terror leaped again in her eyes . " No , no . . . for pity 's sake no , Father . " He began , quietly , to explain why they must confess , how the scheme which the Dean contemplated could not be built upon a lie , especially one which must soon be palpable . He comforted them with the thought that the nine days ' wonder would soon subside and be forgotten . He left them an hour later , somewhat appeased , and with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But as he directed his echoing footsteps homewards through the empty streets his heart ached for Dean Gerald Fitzgerald . The next day passed . He was out visiting most of the time , and did not see the Dean . But a curious hollowness , a kind of suspended animation , seemed to float within the Presbytery . He was sensitive to atmosphere . He felt this strongly . At eleven o'clock on the following forenoon , Malcom Glennie broke into his room . " Francis ! You 've got to help me . He 's not going on with it . For God 's sake , come in and talk to him . " Glennie was painfully distressed . He was pale , his lips worked , there was a wildness in his eye . He stuttered :  --  " I do n't know what 's taken him . He must be out of his mind . It 's such a beautiful scheme . It 'll do so much good  --  " " I have no influence with him . " " But you have  --  he thinks the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You owe it to your flock . It 'll be good for the Catholics  --  " " That hardly interests you , Malcom . " " But it does , " Glennie babbled . " I 'm a liberal man . I admire the Catholics . It 's a beautiful religion . I often wish  --  Oh , for God 's sake , Francis , come in , quick , before it 's too late . " " I 'm sorry , Malcom . It 's disappointing for all of us . " He turned away towards the window . At that Glennie lost all control of himself . He caught hold of Francis ' arm . He snivelled abjectly . " Do n't turn me down , Francis . You owe everything to us . I 've bought a little bit of land , put all my savings in it , it 's worthless if the scheme falls through . Do n't see my poor family ruined . My poor old mother ! Think of how she brought you up , Francis . Please , please persuade him . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn a Catholic for you ! " Francis kept staring out of the window , his hand gripping the curtain , his eyes fixed on the church gable , pointed with a grey stone cross . A dull thought crossed his mind . What would mankinddo for money ? Everything . Even to selling its immortal soul. 138 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOMGlennie exhausted himself at last . Convinced , finally , that nothing could be gained from Francis , he struggled for the remnants of his dignity . His manner altered . " So you wo n't help me . Well , I 'll remember you for this . " He moved towards the door . " I 'll get even with you all . If it 's the last thing I do . " He paused on his way out , his pallid face contorted with malice . " I should have known you 'd bite the hand that fed you . What else could you expect from a lot of dirty papists ! " He slammed the door behind him . The hollowness continued within the Presbytery : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlines , become unsubstantial , transitory . The servants moved on tiptoe , as though it were a house of death . The Lithuanian Father wore a look of sheer bewilderment . Father Mealey went about with his eyes cast down . He had received a grave hurt . But he kept silence , which in one so naturally effusive was a singular grace . When he spoke it was of other matters . He distracted himself , passionately , with his work at the Foreign Missions office . For more than a week after Glennie 's outburst Francis had no encounter with Fitzgerald . Then , one morning , as he entered the sacristy , he found the Dean unvesting . The altar boys had gone ; the two were alone . Whatever his personal humiliation , the Dean 's control of the disaster had been consummate . Indeed , in his hands it ceased to be disaster . Captain Hollis had willingly torn up the contracts . An occupation had been found for Neily in a distant town : the first step towards discreet withdrawal of the family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on Sunday , the Dean climbed again into the pulpit . Facing the hushed congregation , he gave the text : " 0 Ye of Little Faith ! " Quietly , with still intensity , he developed his thesis : What need had the Church of additional miracles ? Had she not fully justified herself , miraculously , already ? Her foundations were planted deep , foursquare , upon the miracles of Christ . It was pleasant , no doubtAN UNSUCCESSFUL CURATE 139exciting , to meet a manifestation like that of Marywell . They had all , himself included , been carried away with it . But on sober reflection , why all this outcry about a single blossom , when the very flower of heaven bloomed here in the church , before their eyes ? Were they so weak , so pusillanimous in their faith they needed further material evidence ? Had they forgotten the solemn words : " Blessed are they that have not seen , and have believed " ? It was a superb feat of oratory . It surpassed his triumph of the previous Sunday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it cost him . At first , in the sacristy , the Dean seemed about to maintain his inflexible reserve . But , when ready to leave , with his black coat cast about his shoulders , he suddenly swung round . In the clear light of the sacristy Francis was shocked to see the deep lines on the handsomeface , the weariness in the full grey eyes . " Not one lie , Father , but a tissue of lies . Well ! God 's will be done ! " He paused . " You 're a good fellow , Chisholm . It 's a pity you and I are incompatible . " He went out of the sacristy , erect . By the end of Easter the event had almost been forgotten . The neat white railing which had been erected round the Well in the Dean 's first ardour still stood ; but the little entrance gate remained unlocked , swinging , rather pathetically , in the light spring air . A few good souls went occasionally to pray and bless themselves with the sparkling , ever-gushing water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rejoiced in his own forgetfulness . The smear of the experience was gradually wearing off . What remained was only a faint ugliness at the back of his mind , which he quickly suppressed and would soon bury completely . His idea of a new playing field for the boys and young men of the parish had taken tangible form . He had been offered the use of a strip of the Public Park by the local council . Dean Fitzgeraldhad given his consent . He was now immersed in a pile of catalogues . On the eve of Ascension Day he received an urgent call to visit Owen Warren . His face clouded . He rose immediately , the140 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOMcricket folder falling from his knee . Though he had expected this summons for many weeks , he dreaded it . He went quickly to the church and , with the viaticum upon his person , hurried through the crowded town to Glanville Street . His expression was fixed and sad as he saw Dr. Tulloch pacing restlessly outside the Warren home . Tulloch was attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached . " Has it come at last ? " Francis said . " Yes , it 's come ! " As an afterthought : " Yesterday the main artery thrombosed . It was n't any use  --  even to amputate . " " Am I too late ? " " No . " Tulloch 's manner held a subdued violence . He shouldered roughly past Francis . " But I 've been in three times at the boy while you 've been strolling along . Come in , damn it . . . if you 're coming in at all . " Francis followed the other up the steps . Mrs. Warren opened the door . She was a spare woman of fifty , worn out by the weeks of anxiety , plainly dressed in grey . He saw that her face was wet with tears . He pressed her hand in sympathy . " I 'm so sorry , Mrs. Warren . " She laughed  --  weakly , chokingly . " Go into the room , Father ! " He was shocked . He thought that grief had momentarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Owen was lying on the counterpane of his bed . His lower limbs were unbandaged , bare . They were rather thin , showing the wasting of disease . Both were sound , unblemished . Dazed , Francis watched Dr. Tulloch lift up the right leg and run his hand firmly down the sound straight shin which yesterday had been a festering malignant mass . Finding no answer in the doctor'schallenging eyes , he turned giddily to Mrs. Warren , saw that her tears were tears of joy . She nodded blindly , through these tears . " I bundled him up warm in the old gocar ' this morning before anybody was about . We would n't give up , Owney and me . He hadAN UNSUCCESSFUL CURATE 141always believed . . . if he could only get up there to the Well .. . We prayed and dipped his leg in the water . . . . When we got back . . .

" In the street , outside , Willie Tulloch stared doggedly at his friend . " There 's bound to be a scientific explanation beyond the scope of our present knowledge . An intense desire for recovery  --  **25;7429;TOOLONG of the cells . " He stopped short , his big hand trembling on Francis ' arm . " Oh , God !  --  if there is a God !  --  let 's all keep our bloody mouths shut about it ! " That night Francis could not rest . He stared with sleepless eyes into the blackness above his head . The miracle of faith . Yes , faith itself was the miracle . The waters of Jordan , Lourdes , or Marywell  --  they mattered not a jot . Any muddy pool would answer , if it were the mirror of God 's face . Momentarily , the seismograph of his mind faintly registered the shock : a glimmering of the knowledge of the incomprehensibility of God . He prayed fervently. 0 dear God , we do n't even know the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , covered with a million layers of cotton wool , striving . . . striving to see the sky . 0 God . . . dear God , give me humility . . . and give me faith ! IIIIT was three months later when the Bishop 's summons arrived . Francis had expected it for some time now , yet its actual arrival somewhat dismayed him . Heavy rain began as he walked up the hill towards the palace ; only by racing the intervening distance did he avoid a thorough drenching . Out of breath , wet and splashed with mud , he felt his arrival somewhat lacking in dignity . Insensibly his anxiety increased as he sat , slightly shivering , in the formal142 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOMparlour , gazing at his mired boots , so incongruous upon the red pile carpet . At last the Bishop 's secretary appeared , ushered him up a shallow flight of marble stairs , and silently indicated a dark mahoganydoor . Francis knocked and went in . His Lordship was at his desk , not bent at work but resting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm of his leather chair . The fading light , striking sideways through the velvet pelmets of the tall window , enriched the violet of his biretta but found his face in shadow . Francis paused uncertainly , disconcerted by the impassive figure , asking himself if this were really his old friend of Holywell and San Morales . There was no sound but the faint ticking of the Buhl clock on the mantelpiece . Then a severe voice said : " Well , Father , any miracles to report tonight ? And by the by , before I forget , how is the dance-hall business doing now ? " Francis felt a thickness in his throat , he could have cried for sheer relief . Flis Lordship continued his scrutiny of the figure marooned on the wide rug . " I must confess it affords some relief to my old eyes to see a priest so manifestly unprosperous as you . Usually they come in here looking like successful undertakers . That 's an abominable suit you 're wearing  --  and dreadful boots ! " He rose slowly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am delighted to see you . But you 're horribly thin . " He placed his hand on the other 's shoulder . " And good gracious , horribly wet , too ! " " I got caught in the rain , your Grace . " " What ! No umbrella ! Come over to the fire . We must get you something warm . " Leaving Francis , he went to a small escritoire and produced a decanter and two liqueur glasses . " I am not yet properly acclimatized to my new dignity . I ought to ring and commandsome of these fine vintages used by all the Bishops one reads about . This is only Glenlivet , but it 's fit tipple for two Scots . " He handed Francis a tiny glassful of the neat spirit , watched him drink it , then drank his own . He sat down on the other side of the fireplace . " Speaking of dignity , do not look so scared of me . I'mAN UNSUCCESSFUL CURATE 143bedizened now  --  I admit . But underneath is the same clumsy anatomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , your Grace . " There was a pause , then His Lordship said , directly and quietly : " You 've had a pretty thin time , I imagine , since you left San Morales . " Francis answered in a low voice . " I 've been a pretty good failure . " " Indeed ? " " Yes , I felt this coming . . . this disciplinary interview . I knew I was n't pleasing Dean Fitzgerald lately . " " Just pleasing Almighty God , eh ? " " No , no . I 'm really ashamed , dissatisfied with myself . It 's my incorrigiblyrebellious nature . " A pause . " Your culminating iniquity seems to be that you failed to attend a banquet in honour of Alderman Shand . . . who has just made a magnificent donation of five hundred pounds to the new high altar fund . Can it be that you disapprove of the good Alderman  --  who , I am told , is slightly less pious in his dealings with the tenants of his slum property in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis halted in confusion . " I do n't know . I was wrong not to go . Dean Fitzgerald specially advised us we must attend . . . he attached great importance to it . But something else cropped up ... " " Oh ? " The Bishop waited . " I was called to see someone that afternoon . " Francis spoke with great reluctance . " You may remember . . . Edward Bannon .. . though he 's unrecognizable now , in his illness , paralyzed , drooling , a caricature of God-made man . When it was time for me to go he clutched my hand , implored me not to leave him . I could n't help myself . . . or restrain a terrible sick pity for this . . . grotesque , dying outcast . He fell asleep mumbling , John the Father , John the Son , John the Holy Ghost , ' saliva running down his grey unshaven chin , holding my hand . . . . I remained with him till morning . " A longer pause . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saint . " 144 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOMFrancis hung his head . " I am annoyed with myself . I keep trying to do better . It 's strange  --  when I was a boy I had the conviction that priests were all quite infallibly good . . . " " And now you are discovering how terribly human we are . Yes , it 's unholy that your rebellious nature ' should fill me with joy , but I find it a wonderful antidote to the monotonous piety I am subjected to . You are the stray cat , Francis , who comes stalking up the aisle when everyone is yawning their head off at a dull sermon . That 's not a bad metaphor  --  for you are in the church even if you do n't match up with those who find it all by the wellknownrule . I am not flattering myself , when I say that I am probably the only cleric in this diocese who really understands you . It 's fortunate I am now your Bishop . " " I know that , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meditated , " you are not a failure , but a howling success . You can do with a little cheering up  --  so I 'll risk giving you a swelled head . You 've got inquisitiveness and tenderness . You 're sensible of the distinction between thinking and doubting . You 're not one of our ecclesiastical milliners who must have everythingstitched up in neat little packets  --  convenient for handing out . And quite the nicest thing about you , my dear boy , is this  --  you have n't got that bumptious security which springs from dogma rather than from faith . " There was a silence . Francis felt his heart melt towards the old man . He kept his eyes cast down . The quiet voice went on . " Of course , unless we do something about it you 're going to get hurt . If we go on with cudgels there 'll be too many bloody heads  --  including your own ! Oh , yes , I know  --  you 're not afraid . But I am . You 're too valuable to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to put before you . " Francis raised his head quickly , met His Lordship 's wise and affectionate gaze . The Bishop smiled . " You do n't imagine I 'd be treating you as a boon companion if I did n't want you to do something for me ! " " Anything . . . " Francis stumbled on the words . AN UNSUCCESSFUL CURATE 145There was a long pause . The Bishop 's face was gravely chiselled . " It 's a big thing to ask . . . a great change to suggest . . . if it is too much . . . you must tell me . But I think it is the very life for you . " Again a pause . " Our Foreign Missions Society has at last been promised a vicariate in China . When all the formalities are completed , and you 've had some preparation , will you go there as our first unprincipled adventurer ? " Francis remained completely still , numb with surprise . The walls seemed to crumble about him . The request was so unexpected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To leave home , his friends , and move into a great unknown void . . . He could not think . But slowly , mysteriously , a strange animation filled his being . He answeredhaltingly : " Yes . . . I will go . " Rusty Mac leaned over and took Francis ' hand in his . His eyes were moist and had a poignant fixity . " I thought you would , dear boy . And I know you 'll do me credit . But you 'll get no salmon fishingthere , I warn you . " IVTHE CHINA INCIDENTxEnxi.Y in the year 1902 a lopsided junk making dilatory passage up the endless yellow reaches of the Ta-Hwang River in the province of Chek-kow , not less than one thousand miles inland from Tientsin , bore a somewhat unusual figurehead in the shape of a medium-sized Catholic priest wearing list slippers and an already wilted topee . With his legs astride the stubby bowsprit and his breviary balanced on one knee , Francis ceased momentarily his vocal combat with the Chinese tongue , in which every syllable seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chromatic scale , and let his gaze rest on the drifting brown-andochrelandscape . Fatigued after his tenth night in the three-foot den between-decks which was his cabin , he had , in the hope of a breath of air , forced himself forward into the bows through the packed welter of his fellow passengers : farm labourers , basket and leather workers from Sen-siang , bandits and fishermen , soldiers and merchants on their way to Pai-tan , squatting elbow to elbow , smoking , talking and tending their cooking pots amongst the crates of ducks , the pigpens and the heaving net which held the solitary but fractious goat . Although Francis had vowed not to be fastidious the sounds , sights and smells of this final yet interminable stage of his journeyhad tried him severely . He thanked God and Saint Andrew that tonight , short of further delay , he would at last reach Pai-tan . Even yet he could not believe himself a part of this new fantastic world , so remote and alien , so incredibly divorced from all that he had known , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had suddenly been bent , grotesquely , away from its natural form . He checked his sigh . Others lived to a smooth and normal pattern . He was the oddity , the misfit , the little crooked man. 150 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOMIt had been hard to say good-bye to those at home . Ned , mercifully , had passed away three months ago , a blessed ending to that grotesque and pitiful epilogue of life . But Polly . . . he hoped , he prayed he might see Polly in the future . There was consolation in the fact that Judy had been accepted as a shorthand-typist in the Tynecastle Council offices  --  a post which offered security and good chances of promotion . As if to steel himself anew he pulled from his inside pocket the final letter relating to his appointment . It was from Father Mealey , now relieved of his parish duties at St. Dominic 's to devotehimself exclusively to the F.M.S. Administration . Addressed to him at Liverpool University , where for the past twelve months he had hammered out his language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am overjoyed to be the bearer of glad tidings ! We have just received news that Pai-tan , in the Vicariate of Chek-kow , which , as you well know , was presented to us by the A.F.M.S. in December , has now been ratified by the Congregation of Propaganda . It was decided at our meetingheld at the F. M. S. in Tynecastle tonight that nothing need delay your departure . At last , at last , I am able to speed you on your glorious mission to the Orient . So far as I can ascertain Pai-tan is a delightful spot , some miles inland , but on a pleasant river , a thriving city specializing in the manufacture of baskets , with an abundance of cereal , meat , poultry , and tropical fruits . But the supremely important , the blessed fact is that the mission itself , while somewhat remote and for the past twelve months unfortunatelywithout a priest , is in a highly flourishing condition . I 'm sorry we have no photographs but I can assure you the layout is most satisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( What an exciting sound that word " compound " has ! Do n't you remember as boys when we played Indians ? Forgive my enthusiasms . ) But la creme de la creme lies in our proved statistics . Enclosed you will find the annual report of the late incumbent , Father Lawler , who , a year ago , returned to San Francisco . I do n't propose to analyze this for you since you will indubitably con it over , nay , digest it in the wee small hours . Nevertheless I may stress these figures : that although established only three years ago the Pai-tan mission can boast of four hundred communicantsand over one thousand baptisms , only a third of which were in articulo mortis . Is it not gratifying , Francis ? An example of how the CHINA INCIDENT 151dear old grace of God leavens even heathen hearts amidst pagan temple bells . My dear fellow , I rejoice that this prize is to be yours . And I have no doubt that by your labours in the field you will materially increase the vineyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I feel that you have at last found your metier and that the little eccentricities of tongue and temper which have been your trouble in the past will no longer be part and parcel of your daily life . Humility , Francis , is the life blood of God 's Saints . I pray for you every night . I will be writing you later . Meanwhile do n't neglect your outfit . Get good strong durable soutanes . Short drawers are the best and I advise a body belt . Go to Hanson &; Son ; they are sound people ; and cousins of the organist at the Cathedral . It is just possible I may be seeing you sooner than you imagine . My new post may make me quite a globe trotter . Would n't it be grand if we met in the shady compound of Pai-tan ? Again my congratulations and with every good wish , I remain , your devoted brother in J. C.ANSELM MEALEYSecretary to the Foreign Missions Society , Diocese of Tynecastle . Towards sundown a heightening of the commotion in the junk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yawed round a bend into a great bight of dirty water , mobbed by a pack of sampans , Francis eagerly scanned the low tiered reaches of the town . It seemed like a great low hive , humming with sound and yellow light , fronted by the reedy mud flats with their flotsam of rafts and boats , backed distantly by mountains , pink and of a pearly translucency . He had hoped the mission might send a boat for him but the only private wherry was for Mr. Chia , merchant and wealthy resident of Pai-tan , who now emerged for the first time , silent and satin-clad , from the recesses of the junk . This personage was about thirty-five , but of such composure he looked older , with a supple golden skin and hair so black it seemed moist . He stood with leisurely indifference while the kapong fussed around him . Though his lashes did not once flicker in the direction of the priest , Francis had the odd conviction he was being taken in minutely. 152 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOM Owing to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new missioner secured passage for himself and his japanned tin trunk . As he stepped down to the sampan he clutched his large silk umbrella , a glorious thing covered in Chisholm tartan which Bishop MacNabb had pressed upon him as a parting gift . His excitement rose when , nearing the bank , he saw a great press of people on the landing steps . Was it a welcome from his congregation ? What a splendid thought for the end of his long , long journey ! His heart began to beat almost painfully , with happy expectation . But alas , when he landed he saw he was mistaken . No one greeted him . He had to push his way through the staring yet incurious throng . At the end of the steps , however , he stopped short . Before him , smiling happily , dressed in neat blue and bearing , as a symbol of their credentials , a brightly coloured picture of the Holy Family , were a Chinese man and woman . As he stood , the two small figures approached him , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and zealously blessing themselves . Introductions began  --  less difficult than he had supposed . He asked warmly :  --  " Who are you ? " " We are Hosannah and Philomena Wang  --  your beloved cate- chists , Father . " " From the mission ? " " Yes , yes , Father Lawler made a most excellent mission , Father . " " You will conduct me to the mission ? " " By all means , let us go . But perhaps Father will honour us and come first to our humble abode . " " Thank you . But I am eager to reach the mission . " " Of course . We will go to the mission . We have bearers and a chair for Father . " " You are very kind , but I would prefer to walk . " Still smiling , though less perceptibly , Hosannah turned and in a rapid unintelligible exchange , which had some semblance of an argument , dismissed the sedan chair and the string of porters which he had in tow . Two coolies remained : one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party set off on foot . Even in the tortuous and dirty streets it was agreeable for Francis to stretch his legs , cramped from confinement in the junk . A quick fervour stirred his blood . Amidst the strangeness he could feel the pulse of humanity . Here were hearts to be won , souls to be saved ! He became aware of one of the Wangs , pausing , to address him . " There is an agreeable dwelling in the Street of the Netmakers ... only five taels by the month . . . where Father might wish to spend the night . " Francis looked down in amused surprise . " No , no , Hosannah . Onwards to the mission ! " There was a pause . Philomena coughed . Francis realized that they were standing still . Hosannah politely smiled . " Here , Father , is the mission . " At first he did not fully understand . Before them on the riverbank was an acre of deserted earth , sunscorched , gullied by the rains , encircled by a tramped-down piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud-brick chapel , the roof blown off , one wall collapsed , the others crumbling . Alongside lay a mass of caved-in rubble which might once have been a house . Tall feathery weeds were sprouting there . A single meagre shell remained , amidst the ruins , leaning yet still straw-roofed  --  the stable . For three minutes Francis stood in a kind of stupor , then he slowly turned to the Wangs , who were close together , watching him , neat , unfathomable , similar as Siamese twins . " Why has this taken place ? " " It was a beautiful mission , Father . It cost much  --  and we made many financial arrangements for its building . But alas , the good Father Lawler placed it near the river . And the Devil sent much wicked rain . " " Then where are the people of the congregation ? " " They are wicked people without belief in the Lord of Heaven . " The two spoke more rapidly now , helping each other , gesticulating , 154 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOM " Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Since the good Father Lawler has gone away we have not been paid our lawful stipend of fifteen taels each month . It has been impossible to keep these wicked people properly instructed . " Crushed and devastated , Father Chisholm removed his gaze . This was his mission , these two his sole parishioners . The recollection of the letter within his pocket sent a sudden upsurge of passion over him . He clenched his hands , stood thinking , rigidly . The Wangs were still talking fluently , trying to persuade him to return to the town . With an effort he rid himself of their importunities , their unctuous presence . It was , at least , a relief to be alone . Determinedly , he carried his box into the stable . At one time a stable had been good enough for Christ . Gazing round he saw that some straw still littered the earthen floor . Though he had neither food nor water , at least he had a bed . He unpacked his blankets , began to make the place as habitable as he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable . Across the decapitatedfence , outside the nearest of the temples which stippled the adjacent hill , stood an aged bonze wearing thick stockings and a quilted yellow robe , beating his metal plaque into the short unheeding twilight with measured boredom . The two priests  --  of Buddha and of Christ  --  inspected each other in silence ; then the old man turned , expressionless , mounted the steps and vanished . Night fell with the swiftness of a blow . Francis knelt down in the darkness of the devastated compound and lifted his eyes to the dawning constellations . He prayed with fierce , with terrible intensity . Dear God , you wish me to begin from nothing . This is the answer to my vanity , my stubborn human arrogance . It 's better so ! I 'll work , I 'll fight for you . I 'll never give up . . . never . . . never ! Back in the stable , trying to rest , while the shrill ping of mosquitoesand the crack of flying beetles split the sweltering air , he forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a dreadful fool . Saint Teresa had likened life to a night in a hotel . This one they had sent him to was not the Ritz ! THE CHINA INCIDENT 155Morning came at last . He rose . Taking his chalice from its cedar box , he made an altar of his trunk and offered up his mass , kneelingon the stable floor . He felt refreshed , happy and strong . The arrival of Hosannah Wang failed to discompose him . " Father should have let me serve his mass . That is always included in our pay . And now  --  shall we find a room in the Street of the Netmakers ? " Francis reflected . Though he had stubbornly made up his mind to live here till the situation cleared , it was true that he must find a more fitting center for his ministrations . He said : " Let us go there now . " The streets were already thronged . Dogs raced between their legs , pigs were rooting for garbage in the gutter . Children followed them , jeering and shouting . Beggars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wares , in the Street of the Lanternmakers , spat sullenly across the foreign devil 's feet . Outsidethe yamen of justice , a peripatetic barber stood twanging his long tongs . There were many poor , many crippled , and some , blinded by smallpox , who tapped their way forward with a long bamboo and a queer high whistle . It was an upper room Wang brought him to , clumsily partitionedwith paper and bamboo , but sufficient for any service he would conduct . From his small store of money he paid a month 's rent to the shopkeeper , named Hung , and began to set out his crucifix and solitary altar cloth . His lack of vestments , of altar furnishings , fretted him . Led to expect a full equipment at the " flourishing " mission , he had brought little . But his standard , at least , was planted . Wang had preceded him to the shop below and as he turned to descend he observed Hung take two of the silver taels which he had given him and pass them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early guessed the worth of Father Lawler 's legacy Francis was conscious of a sudden mounting of his blood . Outside , in the street , he turned quietly to Wang. 156 THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOM " I regret , Hosannah , I can not pay your stipend of fifteen taels a month . " " Father Lawler could pay . Why can not the Father pay ? " " I am poor , Hosannah . Just as poor as was my Master . " " How much will the Father pay ? " " Nothing , Hosannah ! Even as I am paid nothing . It is the good Lord of Heaven who will reward us ! " Wang 's smile did not falter . " Perhaps Hosannah and Philomena must go where they are appreciated . At Sen-siang the Methodys pay sixteen taels for highly respected catechists . But doubtless the good Father will change his mind . There is much animosity in Pai-tan . The people consider the feng shua of the city  --  the Laws of Wind and Order  --  destroyed by the intrusion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Francis did not speak . There was a strained pause . Then Wang bowed politely and departed . A coldness settled upon Francis as he watched the other disappear . Had he done right in alienating the friendly Wangs ? The answer was that the Wangs were not his friends , but lick-spittle opportunistswho believed in the Christian God because of Christian money . And yet . . . his one contact with the community was severed . He had a sudden , frightening sense of being alone . As the days passed this horrible loneliness increased , coupled with a paralyzing impotence . Lawler , his predecessor , had built upon sand . Incompetent , credulous , and supplied with ample funds , he had rushed about , giving money and taking names , baptizing promiscuously , acquiring a string of " rice-Christians , " filling long reports , unconsciously the victim of a hundred subtle squeezes , sanguine , bombastic , gloriously triumphant . He had not even scratched the surface . Of his work nothing remained except perhaps  --  in the city 's official circles  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small sum set for his living expenses , and a five-pound note pressed into his hand by Polly on his departure , Francis had no money whatsoever . He had been warned , too , on the futility of requesting grants from the new society at home . Sickened byTHE CHINA INCIDENT 157Lawler 's example , he rejoiced in his poverty . He swore , with a feverish intensity , that he would not hire his congregation . What must be done would be done with God 's help and his own two hands . Yet so far he had done nothing . He hung a sign outside his makeshift chapel ; it made no difference : none appeared to hear his mass . The Wangs had spread a wide report that he was destitute , with nothing to distribute but bitter words . He attempted an open-air meeting outside the courts of justice . He was laughed at , then ignored . His failure humiliated him . A Chinese laundryman preaching Confucianism in pigeon-English in the streets of Liverpool would have met with more success . Wildly he fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incompetence . He prayed , he prayed most desperately . He ardently believed in the efficacy of prayer . " Oh God , you 've helped me in the past . Help me now , for God 's sake , please . " He had hours of raging fury . Why had they sent him , with plausible assurances , to this outlandish hole ? The task was beyond any man , beyond God Himself ! Cut from all communications , buried in the hinterland , with the nearest missioner , Father Thibodeau , at Sen-siang , four hundred miles away , the place was quite untenable . Fostered by the Wangs , the popular hostility towards him increased . He was used to the jeers of the children . Now , on his passage through the town , a crowd of young coolies followed , throwingout insults . When he stopped a member of the gang would advanceand perform his natural functions in the vicinity . One night , as he returned to the stable , a stone sailed out of the darkness and struck him on the brow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he bandagedhis broken head , his own wound gave him a wild idea , making him pause , rigid and intent . Yes . . . he must . . . he must get closer to the people . . . and this . . . no matter how primitive .. , this new endeavour might help him to that end . Next morning , for two extra taels a month , he rented the lower back room of the shop from Hung and opened a public dispensary . He was no expert  --  God knew . But he had his St. John 's certificate , and his long acquaintance with Dr. Tulloch had grounded him soundly in hygiene . At first no one ventured near him ; and he sweated with despair . But gradually , drawn by curiosity , one or two came in . There was always sickness in the city and the methods of the native doctors were barbaric . He had some success . He exacted nothing in money or devotion . Slowly his clientele grew . He wrote urgently to Dr. Tulloch , enclosing Polly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressings , bandages , and simple drugs . While the chapel remained empty the dispensary was often full . At night , he brooded frantically amongst the ruins of the mission . He could never rebuild on that eroded site . And he gazed across the way in fierce desire at the pleasant Hill of Brilliant Green Jade where , above the scattered temples , a lovely slope extended , sheltered by a grove of cedars . What a noble situation for a monument to God ! The owner of this property , a civil judge named Pao , member of that inner intermarried community of merchants and magistrates who controlled the city 's affairs , was rarely to be seen . But on most afternoons , his cousin , a tall dignified mandarin of forty , who managed the estate for Mr. Pao , came to inspect and to pay the labourers who worked the clay-pits in the cedar grove . Worn by weeks of solitude , desolate and persecuted , Francis was undoubtedly a little mad . He had nothing ; he was nothing . Yet one day , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed the road towards his chair . He did not understand the impropriety of this direct approach . In fact he knew little of what he did : he had not been eating properly , and was lightheaded from a touch of fever . " I have often admired this beautiful property which you so wisely administer . " Taken wholly by surprise , Mr. Pao 's cousin formally viewed theshort alien figure with its burning eyes , and the soiled bandage on its forehead . In frigid politeness he bore with the priest 's continued assaults upon the syntax , briefly deprecated himself , his family , his miserable possessions , remarked on the weather , the crops , and the difficulty the city had experienced last year in buying off the WaiChubandits ; then pointedly opened the door of his chair . When Francis , with swimming head , strove to return the conversation to the Green Jade land , he smiled coldly . " The Green Jade property is a pearl without price , in extent more than sixty mous . . . shade , water , pasture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purpose of tiles , pottery and bricks . Mr. Pao has no desire to sell . Already , for the estate , he has refused . . . fifteen thousand silver dollars . " At the price , ten times greater than his most fearful estimate , Francis ' legs shook .
