Denied other halls by the government and by leary landlords , the Communist-run Western Hemisphere Peace Congress met last week in an old Mexico City sports arena , still redolent of sweat and arnica . A swatch of peace posters blotted out a big notice reading : " Please check your guns and knives . " Overhead a flock of 40 red-eyed , papier mch doves of peace hovered between a battered Scoreboard and " No Betting " signs . <P> The sparkplug of the congress was suave , greying Vicente Lombardo Toledano , Mexican boss of the leftist Latin American Confederation of Workers . An old hand at organizing pro-Communist meetings , he had the shabby hall packed on opening night with 5,000 people , including 800 delegates from the U.S. , Canada and Latin America . During a two-hour delay before the rally got under way , they whooped it up with cheers for " Peace , Peace , Peace ! " <P> Sounding the Pitch . The Communist keynote - Down with Yankee Imperialism - had been anticipated long before Poet-Chairman Enrique Gonzlez Martnez uttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as each delegation chairman got off a short , sharp speech . <P> Said Chilean Communist Cesar Godoy , an ex-Senator : " Chile is a typical example of how imperialist warmakers served by repulsive native agents seek to destroy what is best in the country . " Mrs. Paul Robeson explained that her husband had stayed in the U.S. " to finish the battle of Peekskill " ( TIME , Sept. 5 ) . Only the U.S. 's O. John Rogge , after unsuccessful efforts had been made to censor him , struck a discordant note , and his was one of the last speeches . Before he finished saying that " the excesses of capitalism are balanced by the excesses of Communism , " most of the audience had walked out . <P> Spreading the Word . The U.S. State Department paid the peace congress little public heed . The Mexican press all but ignored it . With the public barred after the opening day , some concluded that the congress was a flop . But Lombardo and his fellow workers had reason to be satisfied . Said a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and getting plenty of propaganda out of our peace movement . " <P> Despite the enthusiasm of the Mexico City congress , Communism is actually on the decline in Latin America . It has been outlawed in nine countries , plagued by party splits in others . In several countries , e.g. , Cuba , the party has deliberately cut its own membership rolls to be ready for underground activity . Moreover , the peace rally could boomerang on party members in some countries . Brazil 's Deputy Pedro Pomar , who is a member of the outlawed Communist party but holds his seat because he was also elected on the Social Progressive ticket , was threatened with expulsion from Brazil 's Congress after saying in Mexico that Brazil 's armed forces were ruled by " Yankee generals .
