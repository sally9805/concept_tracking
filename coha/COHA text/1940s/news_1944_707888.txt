txt Thomas E. Dewey 's managers in the Republican Presidential contest sent on to Chicago yesterday a message designed to end any lingering doubt there might have been in the minds of some delegates about Mr. Dewey 's willingness to yield to a " draft . " J. Russel Sprague , Herbert Brownell and Edwin F. Jaeckle , the three men on whose shoulders has fallen the task of directing the activities of the Dewey camp in connection with the Presidential nomination , told newspaper men yesterday afternoon as they were boarding a train for Chicago that Mr. Dewey would accept if nomMated . They had intended to withhold such a declaration until they reached Chicago today , but reporters seeing them off yesterday afternoon plied-them with so many questions on the point that they : " jumped the gun " by a few hours , although they still plan to issue a statement in Chicago . Conferred Here Over Week-end All three were fresh from weekend conferences here with Mr. Dewey , who is still personally undeclared except in a negative sense . Mr. Sprague , questioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally said : " The Governor knows I am going to Chicago . He knows Mr. Brownell is going to Chicago , and he knows Mr. Jaeckle is going to Chicago . " Mr. Brownell said : " My personal opinion is that the Governor will accept , if nominated . Any good American would . " Mr. ackle said : " I think he will accept , if nominated . " Before Mr. Brownell and Mr. Jaeckle reached the station platform , reporters had concentrated on Mr. Sprague , and he had been reluctant to discuss the situation for quotation . Finally one reporter reminded him that when he arrived in Chicago he would be asked about Mr. Dewey 's willingness to be drafted " a hundred times an hour . " " What are you going to say when you are asked that in Chicago ? " the reporter inquired . Mr. Sprague then admitted he // had a statement planned for issuance in Chicago . When Mr. Brownell and Mr. Jaeckle arrived , the same question Was ' put to them , and they gave the answers quoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we will say in Chicago . " It is expected , however , that the Chicago statement will give in more detail the reasons why the Dewey managers believe the Governor should be absolved from his " pledge " to remain as Governor of the State of New York for four years , and why his services to the nation are , in their opinion , indispensable . The three men who left yesterday for the convention , which opens a week from today , are the three closest to Mr. Dewey in political matters . Mr. Sprague is national committeeman from New York State , and'has been performing for more than a year the same function for the Dewey camp that James A. Farley did for Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932 ? meeting delegates and political leaders , exchanging information with them , and seeking to tie them down to the Dewey standard . Mr. Jaeckle , Republican chairman of New York State , has been the patronage dispensing agent for the Dewey Administration and also organized the State organization for Mr. Dewey before the latter became Governor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1940 , when he went into the Philadelphia convention as the leading candidate .
