As a cub reporter on the Omaha World-Herald in the early 1900s , Henry Doorly held his job mainly because he was the publisher 's prospective son-in-law . But he went to town as an advertising salesman , quickly became advertising manager , then business manager . Last week Salesman Doorly , publisher of the World-Herald since 1934 , helped Donald Nelson sell other U.S. publishers on a worthy idea : arousing the people to gather steel scrap . <P> Smiling , hustling Henry Doorly had himself demonstrated how . In the World-Herald he put on a whirlwind drive to make all Nebraska scrap-conscious . In full-page advertisements , the newspaper trumpeted the campaign , treated it liberally in its news columns . There were prizes for those bringing in the most scrap ; every movie theater in the State had at least one scrap matinee . On public golf courses and tennis courts , scrap paid greens and court fees ; there were scrap trap shoots and scrap horseshoe meets . Airplanes made surveys of scrap piles , dropped leaflets to farmers . Worshippers brought scrap to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three weeks the World-Herald , which has a monopoly in Omaha and blankets the State ( circulation 185,632 ) , talked of almost nothing but scrap , had Nebraskans talking the same way . Result : 67,000 tons of scrap ( 103 lb. per capita ) , half the State 's quota for six months . <P> Last week in Donald Nelson 's office , the 140 publishers who heard Henry Doorly describe his drive were warned by the steel industry 's Salvage Committee that " only a miracle " can prevent the curtailment of steel production within several months for lack of scrap . Bluff Lieut . General Brehon B. Somervell , chief of the Services of Supply , said : " You are not going to get scrap by one blast in your papers . You will have to keep after it day &; night , for unless everybody puts everything he has into this war , we are not going to win . "
