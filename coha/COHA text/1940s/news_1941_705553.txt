txt Centralization of New York Stock Exchange management to an even greater degree than that suggested by former president William McC . Martin , Jr. , is receiving favorable consideration from a special committee studying the problem . The special group leans toward a report which will eliminate all standing committees and concentrate all policy making and rule making in the board of governors . The committee is understood to be agreed on this idea , although it has not given its final approval . MC : Martin proposed eliminating four of the seven present committees . This group also agrees with Mr. Martin that the size of the board should be reduced , although it has not yet decided how many should constitute the membership . Mr. Martin proposed 16 , instead of the present 32 . This reorganization work will not hold up installation of Emil Schram as the Exchange 's president . The RFC chairman wants to wait until men can be found to take over his work at Washington . He has indicated that he would like a vacation before he takes the Exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been left to him . It will be at least a matter of weeks  --  maybe not before July 1 . But that is only a guess . Acceptance Is Conditioned Mr. Schram 's statement , on accepting the presidency , that he takes it " subject to certain conditions having to do with steps that are now being taken in connection with improving the administration of the organization " means only that he has left the door open in case changes are made with which he may not agree . T*t stipulation undoubtedly would have been blade by any man accepting the presidency of an institution undergoing a management reorganization . It gives him a chance to help guide those changes , if he chooses . If the special committee agrees to eliminate all standing committees  --  there are now seven of them  --  and the Board of Gtvernors approves . the work new done by those standing groups will be handled by the staff and by special COMcaittees appointed from time to time by the Board of Governors and made up of members of the Board . TheselipecisJ groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would serve at the pleasure of the Board . The intention would be to eliminate the situation which now exists of having standing committees which . are pretty much independent bureaus . It might be possible that a standing committee on admission of new members would have to be maintained . But even this could be made more directly responsible to the Board of Governors . So far the special group working on this problem has not taken up the question of compensating the Board of Governors . Mr. Martin proposed that all governors be paid $5,000 a year and the Chairman . $10,000 . At least one member of the special committee opposes this . It is one of the questions that remains to be solved . Classification of Governors Another problem the special committee tris not yet tackled is what classifications the governors shall be chosen from . As it is now there are four classes : ( 1 ) members ( customarily from the New York area ) : ( 2 ) non-members and allied members in the metropolitan area : ( 3 ) members , allied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) " public " governors In this connection sponsors of the so-called Bradford plan are still hard at work , although they have not met with much success before the special committee . This plan , sponsored by the National Committee of Stock Exchange Partners , would have a majority of governors , come from outside New York . Thus " control " would pass to those from out of New York , according to the theory of this plan . J. C. Bradford of Nashville . Tenn. , Stock Exchange member who first urged this plan , has recently written to the heads of the 1,195 corn . panics with securities listed on the , Big Boara . He has urged them to consider his idea that the Exchange should have a " majority of its governors from outside New York City . " He has asked , too , that they write their opinions to Charles Harding , present chairman of the board of governors . As a result Mr. Harding has received a number of letters from these company heads . In his letter Mr. Bradford tells the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick " and " it must be saved . "
